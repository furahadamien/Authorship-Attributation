Probably want to bring in <NAME/> Montovano on the NC PUC question -- we have worked with a local lawyer in the past (I think her name is <NAME/> <NAME/>) that could help with this question and demonstrate that having an RTO does NOT make a state deal with retail competition any sooner than it wants to deal with the question.  <NAME/> Montovano could probably be of assistance here.  Maybe bring in <NAME/> to DC to deal directly with the staff?
