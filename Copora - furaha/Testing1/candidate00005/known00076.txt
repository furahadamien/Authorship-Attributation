There have been a number of e-mails related to my initial request for a transition plan for <NAME/> Ingersoll.  

By this e-mail, I am asking that <NAME/> Yeung take the lead on ensuring a smooth transition and that all meetings are appropriately covered.  Please coordinate as a team to work out the details.  <NAME/> please also consider that <NAME/> Bestard will be returning at some point in the near future.

Thanks,

<NAME/>
