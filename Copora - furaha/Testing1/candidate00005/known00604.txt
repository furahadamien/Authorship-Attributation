Pls work through <NAME/> and Bevin <NAME/> (in <NAME/>).  My understanding is that PUCT filing deadlines are always 3pm, but Bevin can take it over to the PUCT this evening.

I assume that you will create the report and <NAME/> will draft a simple cover sheet filing. <NAME/>, we may need <NAME/> Carroll to sign??
