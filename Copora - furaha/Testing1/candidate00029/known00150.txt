The PLI has a 2-day seminar in <NAME/> on Nov. 5 and 6 which I would like to attend (mega-refresher course for me).  The cost is $1295.  Although I have been looking for a seminar about equity derivatives, this seminar will be helpful in the context of ENE forwards and other affiliated equity deals from the securities vantage point.  <NAME/>

Let me know if you would like to see the brochure.
