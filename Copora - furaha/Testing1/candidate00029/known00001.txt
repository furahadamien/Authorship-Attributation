

<NAME/>:

Per my voice mail, please:

(1) review the Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement dated March 1, 2000 (Section 4.4(d)) between Allegheny Energy Supply Company LLC and <NAME/> Power Marketing, Inc., as amended, for your previously negotiated setoff language, and

(2) please forward a copy of the proposed setoff language to <NAME/> <NAME/> so that he can explain what portion of the provision violates Section 6 of PUHCA.  I will be available for a call at his (and your) convenience.

Thanks.  <NAME/>
