Scroll all the way down to <NAME/>'s original message for contact person and the two <NAME/> companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask <NAME/> for a cap.  Thanks.  <NAME/>
