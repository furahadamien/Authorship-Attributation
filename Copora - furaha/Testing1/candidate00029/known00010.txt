The forwards and puts should be signed and faxed back to Lehman.  Please note the template for these trades (with respect to the definition of "material") left out the word "into".  I didn't find it necessary to impede <NAME/> Corp.'s signature; just let <NAME/> know for the next deal.  Thanks.  <NAME/>
