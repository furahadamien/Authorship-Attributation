I assume you are asking us to agree to deviate from this process.  I am uncomfortable with that due to the fact that if the process is not going to be adhered to anyone can nominate a person for VP based on the strength of an individuals resume.  If everyone else agrees to the exception I won't be the one to hold this up but I don't necessarily agree with the exception being granted.
