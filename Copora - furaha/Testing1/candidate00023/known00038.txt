

<NAME/>,

Thanks for contacting me about this.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to  you about it 
today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.

I think we should go ahead and adjust <NAME/> to manager,
effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus
10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager.
Such promotions take place in March and I think
<NAME/> should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
(i.e. my and <NAME/>'s procrastination).

 
On unrelated and more serious matter. <NAME/> Hickerson is the primary client 
for <NAME/>'s services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is 
unwilling to underwrite <NAME/>'s position (he is in general unhappy with
her contribution). This means that <NAME/> will have to find another sponsor or leave <NAME/>.
Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer
will be quite a challenge.
<NAME/> volunteered to pay a very generous severance to <NAME/> from his budget. 
I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.

<NAME/>
