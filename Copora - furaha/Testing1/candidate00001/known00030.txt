

<NAME/>,
      Last week we coordinated with <NAME/> Kean, <NAME/> Shapiro, Joe Hartsoe and the Washington office, so that they would make sure that our objections (as outlined in <NAME/>'s communication below ) to certain portions of Bingaman's proposed legislation would be heard. They've all been working on the issue this week and will continue through the Bingaman hearings. <NAME/>, El Paso and <NAME/> have all done the same.
