I have signed up for Virtual Bidding course in Albany for October 16.  I was wondering if would be worthwhile to attend to course since you and <NAME/> are coming to <NAME/> the next week.  Basically, do you think that you can give us the same information that the course would while you are here?  Please let me know.

Thanks,
