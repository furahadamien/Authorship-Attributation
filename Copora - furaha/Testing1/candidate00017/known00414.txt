

Though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when <NAME/> will call back the California legislature to address the <NAME/> MOU, here's the latest information we have.
Faced with horrible polling, an unwilling legislature, an uncooperative California PUC, and a wily leader of the state Senate (<NAME/>), <NAME/> is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature.
Rumors of a delay come despite <NAME/>' statements that he would call them back next week.
We received the information about a likely delay from an <NAME/> SVP who's working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow.
It's <NAME/>'s view that the earliest <NAME/> would now call the legislature back is end of next week, with early the following week being most likely.
At this point, the chance remains that <NAME/> may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off, leaving <NAME/> to follow PG&E into chapter 11.
In the meantime, negotiations between <NAME/>' staff, and staff from the Senate and Assembly continue.

We'll report back with information as we get it.

Best,
<NAME/>
