

Couple of additional pieces of information:

In conjunction with the issue paying ESPs past due PX amounts, <NAME/> has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the PX credit going forward.
It remains unclear whether <NAME/> will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due PX credit amounts(e.g., PX credit contributed to undercollection and therefore DA customers should help pay down the undercollection; DA customers must pay for stranded DWR contracts, etc.).  
So while <NAME/> is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter.
Got a call into <NAME/> Fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions.
<NAME/> report back when (and if) we get some answers.

Best,
<NAME/>
