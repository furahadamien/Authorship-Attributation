Does it make sense to run the numbers and see what our "contribution" to <NAME/>'s undercollection would be under <NAME/>'s view?  If you need another copy, let me know.  Question:  I don't know what our book looks like on this issue, but if we were to take the "netting" through a reduction in the PX credit going forward, how much of a hit would that be, particularly if we were to get the $120 MM up front?

Best,
