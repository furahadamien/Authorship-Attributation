sorry to hear about the layoffs.  i think the hatchet falls around here next week.  

<NAME/> Wiebe has been taking care of things here and interacting with <NAME/>
a fair bit and I think he's been doing a great job with things, which is too bad 
since that means he forces me to play around in dev instead of prod ...

anyway, i hope we can enjoy a beer sometime and laugh about enron, but it
doesn't feel too good right now.  

thanks for the note.
