The auction process concludes today and we should no who the winning bid is tomorrow.  It looks like it will be either UBS or Citigroup.  As far as our friends go: <NAME/> Hull got laid off and is looking for a job - he actually got offered to move back to risk but decided not to take the job b/c he thought he had something else in the bag - it turned out that he didn't;  <NAME/> Lenhart - is still here and is in the same boat as I am; <NAME/> Boucher - is still here and is handling the liquidation of EES' retail book - he may or may not continue on with EES depending on whether or not another company is willing to take a chance on EES - apparently there are some pkg deals in the works - he is also interviewing with other companies; <NAME/> got laid off and is touring Europe for a month; Gillette got laid off and moved to <NAME/> to teach English to young <NAME/>ns (how crazy is she?); and <NAME/> still has a job at <NAME/> in tax (the gov't always gets there $$) she is also looking for another job.
 
I think that just about covers everything.  I am sure that you have talked to <NAME/> and know his situation.  How is <NAME/> holding up? I never hear anything from him - tell him I said hello.
 
BTW, <NAME/> (my bro) get married in February.
 
Keep in touch-
<NAME/>
