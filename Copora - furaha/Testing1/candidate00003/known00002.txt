<NAME/> Belden forwarded this message to me.  Can you please add <NAME/> Grigsby, <NAME/> Holst, <NAME/> Ermis, and myself to your email distribution list.  We are all holding significant gas positions in California and are greatly affected by any gas or power developments withing the state.  

With regard to Socal's comments, do you have any additional information?  This is quite a 180 from the presentations that Socal has been giving to the CPUC and at other forums.  Until now they have been consistently stating that they will have plenty of gas.
