We shouldn't necessarily not get paid.

There are many different type of outsourcing structures that we have used.

PetroCanada/Suncor - Milnthorp

<NAME/> Union

Peoples - <NAME/> Luce

Enerconnect - Devries

My experience have been only positive when we have been able to get very close with a customer.  Money will show up.  However, if we do operations/accounting stuff for them we should get paid.
