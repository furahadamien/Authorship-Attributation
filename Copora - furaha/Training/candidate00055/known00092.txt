<NAME/> will not be signing the letter
The leadership met and decided "since they are going to be in session anyway" they would try to pass an electricity bill.
<NAME/> is now targeting a mid Dec markup
There is a meeting tomorrow at 3:00 between Wood and Tauzin; <NAME/> was supposed to be in Dallas.  <NAME/> urged him to stay for the meeting (not clear if he will).
I got the impression from <NAME/> that part of the reason <NAME/> is not sending the letter is that he thinks he will be passing a bill anyway (not necessarily that he disagrees with the substance of the letter).
