

Please process the following effective July 1:

<NAME/> Oxley and <NAME/> <NAME/> base pay increase to 250,000. (Note: I spoke with our outside comp consultant and reviewed Oxley's situation with the EWS O of C.).
<NAME/> <NAME/> (PR) to 225,000. (Note:  I previously asked <NAME/> <NAME/> to review <NAME/>'s position and this is the amount we agreed on).

I would also like to review Shapiro's base pay in light of his now expanded responsibilities.
