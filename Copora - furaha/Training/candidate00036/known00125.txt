Wave is fair but stalling, it had trouble going through 3.30 in auggie but on the nws and api news it broke
other levels are 4.00 in winter and 3.90 in cal 2. My opinion is that it will take a low aga or weather
to push through all three of these resistant levels at one time. Cal 2 was 3.90 bid this morning and then came back off to 3.875 along with winter being 4.01 bid and falling with it. This has happened several times already.
 
Let me know if you need anything else
