

<NAME/>,

Thank you for bringing your team down to <NAME/> to demonstrate the new version of the system. We appreciate the effort that <NAME/>Street has made to upgrade its system, however in our view insufficient progress has been made to change our decision to terminate the Posting Agreement. Once again, thank you the effort your team put in and let's stay touch.
