

I received this email from <NAME/> Taylor at <NAME/> Field Services.  I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the <NAME/> Gas Gathering system.  As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.  I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.  I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty <NAME/>.

PS  I haven't been able to close any deals with <NAME/>, but I feel that I am very close!
