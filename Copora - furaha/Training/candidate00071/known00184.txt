

I spoke with <NAME/> Keohane and he said that <NAME/> Johnston (403/974-6745) and <NAME/> Gaffney (416/865-3711) are on board to handle the Canada filings.

We have signed BP Amoco and Reliant, which I will get you copies of so that you will have the exact names, etc.  Also, I will send you an e-mail with BP's jurisdictions and addresses.

Thanks for your help!
