We don't want to enter into an ISDA with an agency arrangement as it poses problems as far as netting and other matters.  <NAME/> will call <NAME/> and tell him that we will either enter into 6 separate masters or one master with Southern and then they can internally back to back trades.  So, I would not do anything until <NAME/> speaks with you and <NAME/>.
