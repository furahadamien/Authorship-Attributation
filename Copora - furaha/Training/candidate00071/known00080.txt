

<NAME/>:

My CompareRite feature is not working right now, but I can point out the changes we made.  The changes we made were to the final revised form that <NAME/> St. <NAME/> prepared, so for the most part, the changes are the same as hers with these exceptions:

1.	Preamble - "<NAME/> Power Marketing, Inc." has been changed to "<NAME/> North America Corp., formerly known as <NAME/> Capital & Trade Resources Corp.".

2.	First "WHEREAS" paragraph - "WHEREAS, ....identified on Exhibits A and B hereto (whether one or more referred to herein collectively as the "Transactions"), under the ISDA Master Agreement dated May 14, 1998...;".

3.	Second "WHEREAS" paragraph - changed "a" to "an" before "Assignment Agreement dagted April 25, 2001".

4.	Paragraph 3 - changed "Consent and Assignment" to "Consent to Assignment".

5.	Paragraph 8 - "As of...that certain ISDA Master Agreement, dated as of June 16, 1992...".

6.	Signature Line changed from "<NAME/> Power Marketing, Inc." to "<NAME/> North America Corp., formerly known as <NAME/> Capital & Trade Resources Corp.".

7.	Added Exhibit A (Natural Gas Transactions) and Exhibit B (Basis Swaps).

If my CompareRite starts working, I'll try to send you a blacklined copy.
