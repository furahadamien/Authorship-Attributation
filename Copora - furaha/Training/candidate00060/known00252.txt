Our differences are:
Me - <NAME/> Miller, Joe Deffner,<NAME/> <NAME/>
You - Zipper, Ermis, Aucoin
 
I would put them all ahead of <NAME/> however I have no data points apart from p&l on nothing with <NAME/> so I can't comment on him..  Not huge differences in order, apart from your slant on Canadians!  The main issue with yours is Calger behind Benson and Zufferli (and even maybe Dana), he's a future leader of this organisation.  Your ordering is very P&L based.
 
Are we supposed to cover <NAME/> or will Causey? 
 
I added to your file schoolyard.
 
Speak to you later.
