Sorry, I have been out for a few days.  We have been marking the curves appropriately every day.  <NAME/> Bass and <NAME/> Baumbach have continued to get broker quotes twice daily for the duration of the book and to mark the curves correctly.  If you have any specific problems in Texas let me know.
