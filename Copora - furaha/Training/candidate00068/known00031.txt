Noon brunch would probably work better for me considering <NAME/>'s nap time and that Monday is a school day.  I will handling the kids solo since Lyne will be at MD <NAME/> with <NAME/> that day, so I hope everyone is patient with <NAME/> as sometimes he can be a little rowdy at restaurants (he has been known to inflict fear in waiters, waitresses and owners alike).  Remeber those days........
