To make it fair on everyone, I am allowing <NAME/> to take $4 million from Prudency C attached to JEA.  (<NAME/> has created this positive balance himself over the past 12 months with deals he has done in FL & SOCO).

In addition, I will be assuming all customer deals (VEPCO, JEA, Associated, MPMUC).

We will mark the curves in Entergy and TVA where <NAME/> is comfortable taking the position (off-peak also needs to be marked down).  The $4 million from prudency will absorb most of the curve shift.   All of <NAME/> postions will stay in Wholesale.

All parties come out with a fair solution.
