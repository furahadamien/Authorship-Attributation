

Have you spoke to <NAME/> Whalley about <NAME/> Albrecht, Dierdra McCaffery, <NAME/> Brysch, and <NAME/> Kendall.   We need to move forward on putting these teams together, and the above individuals were key candidates indentified to re-build the retail risk management organization over the next 6-9 months.

I would like to hear back today on how we plan on proceeding with these individuals.

Thanks.
