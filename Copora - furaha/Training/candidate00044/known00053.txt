We had a lunch meeting with <NAME/> Lavorato, <NAME/> Delainey, <NAME/>, etc. on Thursday last week, and will have fleshed out a the details of a proposal later this week that would move the management of the settlements function under EWS and leave the service management component (<NAME/> Hughes) under EES.  Final decision expected this week.  --<NAME/>
