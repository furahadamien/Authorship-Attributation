

There are 3 excellent players whom I would draft onto any team that have not been picked up on the Netco list.  

Two of the three are <NAME/> Hall and <NAME/> Sweeney - details below in my e-mail to <NAME/>.  

Another excellent player is Shona <NAME/>.  She currently leads the group that produces the DPR and the MPR.  She had excellent experience with PWC before joining <NAME/>, auditing trading companies in Europe.  I have some thoughts on the value that she could bring in working with a new owner of the business.  She could be instrumental in blending our risk reporting process with another entity.  

I am not sure about the extent of your involvement with the creation of Netco.  If you do anticipate being involved, I would like to talk with you about these individuals and the roles that they could play in creating the best team for Netco.  --<NAME/>
