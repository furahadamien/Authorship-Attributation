

I have my list at home, but I know that we need Dad's sister <NAME/> and her husband, <NAME/> and <NAME/>, <NAME/> in <NAME/> (whose kids are independently dell-wealthy) and I can't remember who else.  I know that there were ten invitations needed, including Mom and Dad.  The list below plus those in this paragraph total 8 - so we must be missing 2.  

I will try to catch <NAME/> and have him look at the list that I copied from Mom.  

Thanks for these.  I will do invitations this weekend.  Do you have the address for <NAME/>'s House?  And do we have a time?  --<NAME/>
