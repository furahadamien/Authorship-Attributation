It is with regret that I have accepted <NAME/>'s letter of recommendation.  <NAME/> has contributed greatly during her tenure at <NAME/>, particularly in the development of global information that has been critical in supporting our effective systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate <NAME/>'s personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in wishing <NAME/> well. 

Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within <NAME/> Net Works of the group led by <NAME/> <NAME/>.  <NAME/> will now report directly to <NAME/> Zipper, who leads <NAME/>Online.  The Operations Product Control Team in its early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to <NAME/>Online a smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges necessary between <NAME/>Online and our legacy systems.  The role of the team has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  operations of <NAME/>Online.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have <NAME/>'s team as an integral part of the larger <NAME/>Online team.  <NAME/>'s team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  <NAME/>, <NAME/> and I met with <NAME/>'s team yesterday to announce this organizational realignment.  <NAME/> has done a great job of leading the Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  <NAME/> is committed to see that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any changes in <NAME/>'s e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations are shared with us.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with <NAME/> and her team.
