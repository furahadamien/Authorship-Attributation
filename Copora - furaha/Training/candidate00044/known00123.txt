Agreement refers to employees of <NAME/> Americas or its subsidiaries, and those employees involved in natural gas specifically.  <NAME/> Networks is not named, but is definitely an oversight because so much of the support for gas comes from <NAME/> Networks.  Close date on the sale was May 31, 2001 - 12 month non-solicit period starts from that point.  --<NAME/>
