

<NAME/>, I know that we would like to get together with you to discuss UT recruiting.  The easiest way to get this set up is probably for you to coordinate with our two assistants on a time that will work.  My assistant is <NAME/> Thompson (x39106) and <NAME/>'s assistant is <NAME/> Westbrook.   By copy of this note, I will ask  <NAME/> to coordinate with <NAME/> and one of the two will get back with you to let you know available dates and times that <NAME/> and I could get with you.  -<NAME/>
