

I worlked with <NAME/> Gosset, <NAME/> White and <NAME/> Hall today on their input for proposed promotions for Operations.  <NAME/> Cashion has the recommended names and salary increases.  Do you need anything else?  Description of their respoinsibilities, rationale for promotion recommendation, etc.?  Let me know.  

I mentioned to <NAME/> that letters had been given to both <NAME/> Gossett and <NAME/> Superty in late November or December stating that they would be promoted from Director to Senior Director at the first of the year.  We have <NAME/> covered, but with the change in <NAME/> Superty's reporting relationship, I want to be certain that his promotion doesn't fall through the cracks.  <NAME/> was somehow unaware of these letters, although they were prepared by HR.  As you review the entire list of proposed promotions, please be check to make sure that <NAME/> Superty's name was submitted by <NAME/> <NAME/> for a promotion.  

Thanks.  --<NAME/>
