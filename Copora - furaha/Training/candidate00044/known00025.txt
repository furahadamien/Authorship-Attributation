With regard to your comment that I am "in", in my conversation with <NAME/> Whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like <NAME/> Haedicke, and perhaps himself, there could be some issues with the Estate and creditors committee if we were to go to Netco immediately.  What I agreed to with <NAME/> is that I will be focused on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in 30 to 60 days.  In the meantime, I will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction.  I will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes, systems, staff expertise and operational controls.  And you can also count on me if I can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for Netco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there.  

<NAME/> Reeves will be getting the org charts to <NAME/> this afternoon before she leaves.  Gas logistics is not included in the operations org charts, as our understanding is that logistics is being included in the commerical org charts.
