

<NAME/> Apollo has recently joined the team and <NAME/> Herod has recently married.  February and March were gone before I could get organized enough to try to celebrate both of these occasions.  In honor of <NAME/>'s arrival and <NAME/>'s marriage, I hope that you can join <NAME/> and me for drinks and appetizers at our house on Saturday, May 5, followed by dinner at Champions Golf Club.  Please include your spouse or a guest, and know that we will also be happy to just have you attend.  Let me know if that date will work for you.
