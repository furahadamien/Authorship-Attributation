We do have a monthly fee of $16,000 that we are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our revenue line to date.  I am not sure why it is not showing up as income.  Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.  I suspect that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost centers.  By copy of this memo to <NAME/> Heinrich, could you and he figure out where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as revenue?  Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should be pure margin.  Hey, you have to start somewhere!  

I have a lunch meeting scheduled with <NAME/> Piper on Friday this week. One of the items that I want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses that we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business.  I don't have an answer for you today on what if any costs will not be allocated to the business units.  Next week I can give you more info on that.
