

Attached is an invitation to attend a dinner hosted by <NAME/> to honor this year's recipients of the <NAME/> MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships.  This is <NAME/>'s third year to award scholarships to three outstanding students in their second year of the MBA program. One of the highlights to those of us involved from <NAME/> is the dinner that we host to recognize the students.  <NAME/> May will be in attendance, as well as other faculty members from the business school, including Ehud Ronn, Director of UT's Center for Energy Finance and Research.  

Since each of you will be in <NAME/> to interview on campus on Tuesday, or will be arriving Tuesday to interview on Wednesday, I hope that you will be able to join us at The <NAME/> House on Tuesday, October 16 for cocktails at 7:00pm and dinner at 7:30pm.  Please RSVP to me by Friday.  I will send you a complete list of attendees on Monday.  Call me if you have any questions.  --<NAME/>
