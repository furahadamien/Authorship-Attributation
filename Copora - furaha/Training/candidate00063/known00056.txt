I am an analyst working for <NAME/> Industrial Markets in <NAME/>, Texas and I am gathering some information on tissue. I spoke to <NAME/> Young and <NAME/> Pinault from RISI and they told me to contact you as you do some more extensive studies on tissue usage. 

What I am looking for are: tissue capacity worldwide and by region (North America, Europe, Latin America, <NAME/>)
and the biggest companies that produce tissue.

Can you also include how much this information would cost?

Thanks in advance,
