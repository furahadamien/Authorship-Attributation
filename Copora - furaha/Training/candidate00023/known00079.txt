

<NAME/>,

Sorry for a delay in responding to your message.
As you can imagine, after <NAME/> Skilling's resignation,
<NAME/> Whalley will be tied up in a few additional stock analysts' presentations.

We are still planning trips to California and New Mexico that we would like to combine
and would like very much to meet and exchange opinions with you.

Please, advise me about your availability during the next 2 - 3 weeks. Hopefully, we
can reconcile our schedules and meet soon.

<NAME/>
