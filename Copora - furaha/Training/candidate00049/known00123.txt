

I am sorry to be difficult and you can definitely have a meeting without me and fill me in later, but the all-employee meeting is today and I have been asked to be there by <NAME/>.  In addition, I have a work lunch headed by <NAME/> to discuss the all-employee meeting.

Sorry again,

<NAME/>
