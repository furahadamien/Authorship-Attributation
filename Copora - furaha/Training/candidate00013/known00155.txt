This note was for your information only to reflect the increased level of expectations that <NAME/> holds his trading organization to and I support this completely.

Your work hours are not in question... nor are those of <NAME/>, and <NAME/> based origination. However I will reiterate that we need to get back to basics and stay focused and I will promote that message given every opportunity.
