

<NAME/>:  Attached are four "restated" confirms formerly in the name of ELFI and now in the name of ENA.  I have reviewed the legal language for conformity with the Master Energy Price Swap Agreement and the language is fine. I previously sent you the three ELFI trades that <NAME/> Ng had originally faxed to me.

I am not familiar with one of trades below, No. 923614.  

If you can reconcile these trades, please have executed and faxed to <NAME/> Ng per her message below.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

<NAME/>
