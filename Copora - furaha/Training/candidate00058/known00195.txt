I believe <NAME/> N. and <NAME/> had a conversation regarding help in the risk mgmt area.  I saw <NAME/> in the hallway earlier and he indicated that he wanted to rally with you and me to discuss. 
I've got two calls into <NAME/> Armstrong with SW Gas.  I hope to get him to send in a request this week.  Also, <NAME/> has been running numbers today, so I should have a term sheet for you tomorrow.  
The Agave Christmas Party is on Tuesday, December 11.  Is it possible to take a company plane out with reps from mgmt, mktg, gas logistics and operations?  
We are also running a few more scenarios for TransPecos.

Thanks, <NAME/>.
