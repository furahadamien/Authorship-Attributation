

Are you back in the office yet?

We've booked Italy tickets this week for departing <NAME/> on Friday, May 24 to Newark/Rome and returning on Sunday, June 9 from Rome to Newark/<NAME/>.  Ticket price was $1,183 per ticket. 

<NAME/> and <NAME/> are on board.  Can you and <NAME/> join us?  <NAME/> and <NAME/> will not be able to go anywhere in 2002 due to <NAME/>'s broken leg.

Please call me, let's discuss.

Thanks, <NAME/>  X33098
