We approve the costs to get real-time DTN feeds.  We would like to sign up for a 3 year agreement so that the $1,000 fee is waived.  We will have seven primary users right now:

<NAME/>, <NAME/> 
Lohman, TK
Lindberg, <NAME/>
Lokay, <NAME/>
McConnell, <NAME/>
Y'barbo, <NAME/>
Watson, <NAME/>

Thanks for all of your help on this.  Please let me know when real-time pricing can be installed.

Thanks, <NAME/>.
