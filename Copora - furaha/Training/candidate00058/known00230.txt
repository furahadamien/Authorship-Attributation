

<NAME/> and <NAME/>,

Please contact Eastern New Mexico (<NAME/>), Enervest (<NAME/>), Citizens (<NAME/>) and Southern Utes (<NAME/>) to make sure they are aware that they are responsible for making the payments on these contracts since ENA has defaulted.  Also, <NAME/>, please confirm again that ENA is not nominating on their own contracts that make up $129,481 of the delinquent payments.

Please keep <NAME/> and I informed of the status.

Thanks, <NAME/>.
