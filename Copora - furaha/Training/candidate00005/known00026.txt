

Per our conversation today --

1.	<NAME/> <NAME/> is working with AReM to (a) work on an alternative vehicle for DA - the Bowen bill, (b) get the "taking" argument for retroactive CPUC action to Norm Plotkin and <NAME/> Katz, (c) call APS Energy Services to motivate Boeing, (d) getting AReM active on the date issue.

By the way, <NAME/> <NAME/> heard that the CPUC has received "hundreds" of letters related to the CPUC decision.

2.	Everyone should be working to get customers focused on messaging to the (a) Governor's office and (b) trade associations.

KEY MESSAGES:	1.	<NAME/>'t have the CPUC Make Wrong Decision Tomorrow
			2.	SB78 can work if DA Suspension Date = Sept 1.01 or Later
			3.	Setting this DA Suspension Date Does NOT Mean that Customers <NAME/> Escape Fair Surcharges

I am putting together a gameplan right now for who to call and the messages.

3.	I called <NAME/> Yamane (at Marathon Communications) re: CEO contacts.  Once I receive the list, we'll make a decision on how to proceed with that group.

4.	Hedy is working to get Hertzberg (and any others) to call the CPUC and seek another delay.

5.	<NAME/> Day - can you please draft language to use on the Assembly floor to "fix" SB78 per our interests.  Hedy & Bev, who should support the amendment?  <NAME/>'t we need a member to carry the provision?  Wouldn't it be better if we had CMTA or the CA Restaurant Association?  Is this possible?

6.	<NAME/> Govenar is calling Boeing's lobbyist to get them "interested".

Thanks everybody.  Keep up the great work!!!
