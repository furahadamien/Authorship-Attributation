I had a conversation with Belco prior to the receipt of the documents <NAME/> forwarded on down to you.  I think before we make any response in the nature of what you are discussing below I think we might want to have a meeting or get <NAME/> involved because that is not what Belco has in mind at all.  Although I understand from <NAME/> Credit's point of view Belco is not longer in the drivers seat with respect to the Belco/Westport relationship, I think we still need to tread gingerly with how we deal with Belco or <NAME/> Lay might be getting a phone call from Mr. Belfer (and I don't want my name to be brought up in that conversation!).  When you get back in the office let's pow-wow about how to approach this.
