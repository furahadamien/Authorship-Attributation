Can you see about getting <NAME/> a Dentist appointment on Mar 1 at 8 AM  (or at 1 PM) ?  Is it time for <NAME/> to have an appointment again?  <NAME/> has off school on Mar 1 & I plan to take a vacation day.  <NAME/> has an appointment for more vaccinations with Dr Kline at 10 AM.  We may go to the zoo after that.
