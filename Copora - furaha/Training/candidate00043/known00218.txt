<NAME/> does not have soccer practice tonight so we are free to meet for dinner pretty much anytime.  I know you are trying to tie up loose ends at the office and I could stand to work a little late tonight.   How does 7 PM at Cafe Express sound? 

 <NAME/>, can you pick up <NAME/> and meet me there?  Gaby says she may take <NAME/> to <NAME/> later this afternoon.  Please pay Gaby if you see her -- as I have given her the day off tomorrow.
