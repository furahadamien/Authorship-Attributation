When systems or the Internet are down, we can't get to the contact info.  I am now resorting to keeping a copy of customer contact info stored on a diskette.

 Are there any plans to store a copy of this info on a non-<NAME/> ISP that could be accessed from our Home ISP if the <NAME/> intranet or servers are down?
