

On October 4th, I'll be trying to fill <NAME/> <NAME/>'s rather large shoes at the Cal State University Center for California Studies' 13th annual envisioning California conference, "Our Year of Disconnect:  The Politics of Power in California."

I'll be participating in a Roundtable at the plenary session entitled: "Lessons Learned, Unlearned & To Be Learned:  A Roundtable on California's Utility Deregulation."

The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, <NAME/> <NAME/>.  The other roundtable-ists include:

<NAME/> Cicchetti (<NAME/> plant?  Anyone know what he's up to these days?)
<NAME/> <NAME/>--<NAME/>
<NAME/> Hoge--head of TURN
<NAME/> <NAME/>--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair <NAME/> is appreciated)
State Senator <NAME/> Bowen
<NAME/> <NAME/>--Self-appointed emporer
Dr. <NAME/> Pratt--History prof., University of <NAME/> (any info on the professor is also appreciated)

Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. <NAME/> will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.

Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.

Best,
<NAME/>
