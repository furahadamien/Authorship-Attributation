I've met Craver, but don't know him as well as Fielder.  Won't be a stretch to get a meeting with Craver if we choose to do it.  <NAME/> is the counterparty.  Regarding the credit issue, in addition to <NAME/>, we should also view the California PUC as a "co-counterparty" to just about anything <NAME/> does over the next 24 months or so.  
 
Best,
<NAME/>
