As you know <NAME/> is being, well, <NAME/> about just about everything at the PUC.  I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.  I've helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (<NAME/> Botorff and <NAME/> <NAME/>) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.  DJ and Delainey are organizing
 
The (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a "reasonable" deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be submitted to PUC around <NAME/>, which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible.
 
At the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3) PG&E's willingness to deal.  The goal is to find out if there's any room for a deal.  Should not take a long time.
 
I hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less productive if you're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that permits us to go around <NAME/>.  Likely attendees are CMTA, CLECA, the Chamber, you (hopefully), PG&E and me.  <NAME/> <NAME/> Kahl be at DJ's meeting?
 
Best,
<NAME/>
