

?	We met with <NAME/> yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	<NAME/> continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--"contributed to <NAME/>'s undercollection" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	<NAME/> says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	<NAME/> intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  <NAME/> estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under <NAME/>'s plan, <NAME/> would likely end up paying <NAME/>, i.e., the present value of the "undercollection" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with <NAME/>, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and <NAME/> 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose <NAME/>'s proposal at the PUC.
?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
?	We are scheduled to meet with <NAME/> again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
<NAME/>
