Meet <NAME/>, Prentice's brother and computer guru-type.  <NAME/> and I talked a little bit about what you're looking for, so I thought I'd just go ahead and facilitate a little chat room here.  Avram, could you explain one more time to <NAME/> exactly what it is that you're looking for, just to make sure that I've accurately and adequately described the situation?  <NAME/> has some ideas.
 
Best,
<NAME/>
