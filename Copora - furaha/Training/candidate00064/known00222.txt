

Can you please add <NAME/> to the interview list.   I like Dale as a candidate to run the URM desk.  Given that <NAME/> <NAME/> has expressed interest in moving into a marketing role under <NAME/> & <NAME/>, we very much need a solid sr. person to run this group.   I understand the West is trying to get one of <NAME/>'s people to come to Portland.   Is Dale a candidate to run both groups?

If <NAME/> leaves, we are big time short.
