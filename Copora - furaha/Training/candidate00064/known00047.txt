

The following people will be making the trip:

Portland			<NAME/>
<NAME/> Belden			<NAME/> Presto
<NAME/> Swerbzin			<NAME/> Sturm
<NAME/> Badeer			Dana <NAME/>
<NAME/> Richter			<NAME/> Benson
<NAME/> <NAME/>			<NAME/> Herndon
<NAME/> Motley			<NAME/> Black
<NAME/> Fisher
<NAME/> Zufferli

Could you please coordinate with aviation to arrange the Falcon 900 to pick up the Portland crew Friday morning with and then confirm flight details with myself and <NAME/> Belden.   We may have to arrange for <NAME/> Black and <NAME/> Herndon to fly on commercial flight due to space limitations on the Falcon.   Let me know if 14 is over the limit so I can let <NAME/> and <NAME/> know.

Thanks.
