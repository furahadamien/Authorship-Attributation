

750k is BS.   <NAME/> has only been working on this for 3-4 weeks.   He has made one trip to Nebraska.   I expect more like 50-100k in costs incurred.   This is precisely why I told <NAME/> to work directly with <NAME/> on this project.

With respect to Ameren, <NAME/> should work directly with me and <NAME/> <NAME/>.

thanks.
