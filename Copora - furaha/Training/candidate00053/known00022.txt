Tonight <NAME/> and I are going to be migrated to Outlook.  Please note that <NAME/> has a laptop computer that is at his home.  I have spoken with Randy about this and he is to be following up with you.  I would like for you to accompany <NAME/> out to the Lavorato home to complete the migration on to his computer.

Also, please note that I gave my and <NAME/>'s passwords to a lady that stopped by my desk today (she is with the migration group).  Could you please confirm for me tomorrow that they have been shreaded.

<NAME/>
