

I received notice today that <NAME/> Villareal , <NAME/> Lamphier and <NAME/> Gottlob have accepted jobs with AEP as part of the sale of HPL (not to leave until closing).    This means that my staffing needs after closing are as follows:

1 Lead Physical Trader
1 Physical Trader
1 Basis Trader (or at least an asst. trader)

1 Industrial/Utility Middle Marketer/Originator
1 Supply Middle Marketer/Originator

I met with <NAME/> Slone and the internal recruiters today to start the external search process for an experienced physical trader and industrial marketer.
I am hoping the other positions can be filled internally with associates and/or internal commercial personnel.

I delivered employment contracts to <NAME/> Wallis, <NAME/> Schwieger, Stacy Neuweiller, <NAME/> Bass and <NAME/> Farmer.  They all wanted to review the documents and talk to me next week about it.  <NAME/> did not give a good feeling that she would be willing to sign it.  I know that she has been contacted by companies other  than AEP about job opportunities and I know other <NAME/> Units have talked to her as well.

Although we met <NAME/>'s numbers he is still hung up on the super vesting language for options; I'll keep working on him.

The others I did not get any read on, but I will talk to them next week.

Given the severe shortage of talent that my desk is going to experience from the HPL transaction I want you to consider realocating experienced talent from other trading and middle marketing desks to the Texas desk.

I will follow up with you when I return from vacation on Monday, March 19th.

Thanks,

<NAME/>
