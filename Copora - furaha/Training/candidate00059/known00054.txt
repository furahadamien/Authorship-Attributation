

<NAME/>,

Here are the new mappings for the EOL products, except for the central desk.  <NAME/> is still working on his but I wanted to get you something.

for physical rest of month deals we attached the physical book id
for prompt month physical deals we attached the TAGG book id

is that correct?


I will send the finished product when <NAME/> is done.  Keep in mind it will probably change again.
