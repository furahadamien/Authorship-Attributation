I thought that there were some unique financing issues that required <NAME/> to retain the transaction.  It appears that is not the case and since this supply is at a split connect location with HPL it should probably go with the sale.  I just want to make sure that the swap is done correctly to keep <NAME/> whole.  Any thoughts?
