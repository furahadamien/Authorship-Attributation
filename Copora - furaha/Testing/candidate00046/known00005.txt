

<NAME/> and I will be on vacation from March 12th thru March 16th.  <NAME/> took a lap top computer with him and is reachable by cell phone.  <NAME/> has our pager and cell phone numbers.  I will be calling in to see how <NAME/> is doing and to see if any of my folks have any questions about their employment contracts.  I asked <NAME/> to keep an eye on <NAME/> as well.  <NAME/> sat in the morning meeting today and will fill for me next week.

Thanks,

<NAME/>
