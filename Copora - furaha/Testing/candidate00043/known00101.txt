Obviously things have been a bit chaotic in our family life as we try to get <NAME/> ("<NAME/>'s new adopted sister) settled into our routines.  We have been trying to keep <NAME/>'s routines as normal as usual, including bedtime and homework time.  While he seems happy with school, I have noticed decreasing marks on his homework and practice tests.  This especially concerns me with respect to his math -- where he has always been an excellent student.

Do you have any suggestions to help <NAME/> with timed practice tests?  Do you recommend any particular classes (Kumon, etc) or workbooks?  If you think it is appropriate to meet to talk about <NAME/>'s progress, I could come to school anytime this Friday, February 1 for a conference.

<NAME/>
