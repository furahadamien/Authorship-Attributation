

<NAME/>,
 
Thanks for securing the Astros tickets for Gas Logistics.  On Monday afternoon I had everyone gather and we had popcorn and a drawing for yesterday's seats, the extra seats for today and this Friday's opening Aeros game.  It turned out great.  Even though I followed this democratic process -- the winners turned out to be exactly the people I wanted to reward.  I also made sure to have a leader in each group to buy the snacks.  Yesterday <NAME/> took <NAME/> <NAME/>, Jerry Graves, and Tracy Minter,Toby Kuehl and <NAME/> Cramer.  Today Dannis Bellard, Dale Ratliff, Terry Kowalke and <NAME/> Chambers are going to the game.  It was a great morale builder.  Thanks.  We'll try to do this again next week if we have extra tickets (Astros cooperating of course).
 
Today, <NAME/> <NAME/> of FPL and <NAME/> Campbell of TECO-PGS are coming to town to go to the game with <NAME/> <NAME/> and I.  I'm also going to have a dinner for them after the game.  Perhaps at <NAME/>'s where hopefully <NAME/> and <NAME/> will join us.  I'll have Ricki leave you a message if you are interested in stoping by.
 
Early this AM I'll be out speaking at <NAME/>'s Ops conference.
 
I'm going to call <NAME/> to get on your calendar to brief you on some key logistics issues and talk about issues related to our current seating arrangements.
