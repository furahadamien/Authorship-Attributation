Mom forwarded a note that you were looking for <NAME/> suggestions.  He is into anything about rocks, <NAME/> Potter, or of course his all time favorite -- baseball.

I'm leaving for Kazakhstan tomorrow, so I didn't have time to ask for gift lists for your guys.  <NAME/> helped me pick out some items -- that I hope they'll like.  Believe me, you will see the <NAME/> influence when you open the items.   A box is on its way to you.

Have a blessed holiday.
