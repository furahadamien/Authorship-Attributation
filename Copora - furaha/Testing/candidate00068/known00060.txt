I got <NAME/>'s and <NAME/>'s right after lunch.  <NAME/> was definitely not impressed but he said we would talk tomorrow.  <NAME/> seemed disappointed but I think if we can bump his retention from $50,000 to $75,000 per six months, I think I can get him over the hump.  He is great value if we can get him for that.
