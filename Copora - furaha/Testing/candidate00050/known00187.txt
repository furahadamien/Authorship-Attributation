

Attached are the Cascade Documents redlined with my changes.  Please review and let's discuss further before forward by to Cascade.  

Some items to note:

1.  As we discussed before, the non-compete provision must be approved through the proper channels at <NAME/>.  The current <NAME/> Corp. policy requires approvals by:
	1.  The President (or equivalent) of <NAME/> North America Corp.
	2.  General Counsel of ENA (<NAME/> Haedicke)
	3.  Executive VP, Corp. Development of <NAME/> Corp.
	4.  Anyone else that ENA requires to approve these non-compete agreements.

2.  We need to scrub how this will fit with EES' business in this area.

I tried to narrow the non-compete provisions as much as possible.  Let's discuss.
