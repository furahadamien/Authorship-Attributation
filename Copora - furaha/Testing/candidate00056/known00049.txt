

I would like to acknowledge <NAME/> Portz for his hard work and diligence in drafting and actively supporting the negotiation of the Green Mountain Power all-requirements transaction in ERCOT.   <NAME/> worked long hours ensuring all tight timelines were met and facilitated quick contract turnarounds on numerous occasions.

In addition to Green Mountain, <NAME/> has exhibited the same hard work and diligence on other Texas transactions (San <NAME/>, misc. QSE contracts, etc.)
