

We have a # of counterparties whom credit will allow daily trading and/or balance of month trading (with no forward trading).  It would be much more efficient for the trading organization and the counterparties to have functionality within EOL that allowed for better credit screening.   We have moved away from the broker markets, and the current screening mechanism forces us to trade in the broker market with credit limited counterparties.

I would like to get this changed ASAP, if possible.

Thanks.
