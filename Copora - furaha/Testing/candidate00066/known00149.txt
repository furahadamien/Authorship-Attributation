I am working on a project that requires the review of employment contracts.  I do not have signed copies of several <NAME/> Canada agreements.  Would you mind faxing them down to me via Twanda as soon as possible on Friday?  We are on a Lavo deadline.   Thanks.

The people are:  <NAME/> <NAME/>, <NAME/> Cowan, <NAME/> Devries, <NAME/> LeDain, <NAME/> <NAME/>, <NAME/> McKay, and <NAME/> Zufferli (only if he signed the one we did for <NAME/> Canada for him-- I have the ENA one dated 12/24/99).

I appreciate your assistance.  Please call Twanda before the fax arrives, as it is a central legal department fax and not a private one.

Thanks a lot!!

<NAME/>
