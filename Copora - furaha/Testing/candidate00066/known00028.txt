Cameron actually wore his yellow rain slicker, his yellow rain shoes, and his red fireman's hat.  So, instead of rain boy, he was a fireman.  I must admit that he looked absolutely adorable!!

Your bash sounds like it was a lot of fun.  I wish I could get <NAME/> to dress up, but he really isn't into that type of thing.  We went to the opera Sat. night -- Tanenhouser.  Wagner really is uptight, isn't he?  Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit -- escaped into the music.  I went to a gala last week for MD <NAME/> Cancer Center.  It was amazing.  <NAME/> Lunden MC'd.  The <NAME/> Symphony provided music.  Video from <NAME/> W. Bush.  Speech by GHW Bush.  Entertainment by one of the Irish Tenors, <NAME/> Lovett, Dhianne Carroll (who had a costume change even though she sang only for 20 minutes!), a 300-person chior, all accompanied by the <NAME/> Symphony.  It was quite the event.  Persons there included the former President Bush and <NAME/>, <NAME/> Baker, <NAME/> Simpson, lots of local celebs, and me and my brother  (one of these things is not like the other!).  Still, we had a great time.  So, not all gloom and doom around here.

Well, I'd better get back to it.
