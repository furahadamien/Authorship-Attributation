If you have other forms that you think work better, please send them our way. I think it will be useful to work from the same document across <NAME/>.

Please note that each situation should be handled consistently with others in similar circumstances, and that special care should be taken for those who have quit prior jobs, relocated, or are in precarious visa situations.
