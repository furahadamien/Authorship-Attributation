I spoke with <NAME/> about the Leaf <NAME/> contracts.  She indicated that we are waiting for details (names, etc) from <NAME/> <NAME/>.  Once we get those, we can generate a draft for review and comment.  I understand that <NAME/> has asked <NAME/> for this data.  Let me know if you have any questions.
