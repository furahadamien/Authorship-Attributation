

With respect to past due PX credit amounts, <NAME/> has told folks today that:

<NAME/> will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts.
<NAME/> is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal.
<NAME/> hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.

We'll distribute <NAME/>'s proposal as soon as we get it.

Best,
<NAME/>
