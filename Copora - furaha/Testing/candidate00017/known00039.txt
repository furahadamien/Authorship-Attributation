It's going to be heard this afternoon, per <NAME/>'s note.  It is not clear whether 1) it's going to make it through the Legislature, and 2) if it does make it through, whether <NAME/> will sign.  It's very tied up with/linked to the other measures (<NAME/> bailout, etc.).  Am trying to get more info, but that's it at this point.  <NAME/> report back on what happens at the hearing on the bill.

Best,
<NAME/>
