If it is <NAME/> Europe we need to forward all inquiries to Price Waterhouse - this is important as <NAME/> Europe is no longer part of <NAME/> and the administrator has all legal claim to the name.  I have no idea what happened to the sale of <NAME/>Direct and who now owns it.  I would suggest ringing London and asking to talk to someone from Price Waterhouse managing <NAME/> Direct.

Take care
