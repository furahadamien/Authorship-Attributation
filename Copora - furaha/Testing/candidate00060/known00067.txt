<NAME/> Taylor forwarded me your request, I thought it may be helpful to introduce myself and <NAME/> Forster, <NAME/> is the Vice President in charge of the commercial/operational aspects of EnronOnline (that was!).  We do have a relaunch plan in place which highlights critical timings which need to be met over the next weeks.  I hope this will assist you.  As <NAME/> probably already informed you we are taking the opportunity to update the PA and ETA.  Under the timescale we do plan to have these with you today.  

Should Citigroup be the winning bidder, we are currently planning to use the website name "citigroupenergy.com, 'ssmbenergy.com' or 'ssbenergy.com'.  If you intend to give us one of your own doamine names please let us know. 

If you have any questions  on the timetable, please do not hesitate to contact <NAME/> or myself, or on the form of the agreements <NAME/> Taylor.
