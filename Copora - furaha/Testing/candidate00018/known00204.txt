

While I am out next week, you can call on the following lawyers if you need assistance:

EnronOnline generally (including "enhanced limit orders") - <NAME/> Gray (x36832)
Private e-marketplaces - <NAME/> Koehler (x33488)
Commodity Logic and hub issues - <NAME/> Greenberg (x58897)

<NAME/> Jones (x33399) may also be able to answer some questions, particularly relating to EnronOnline counterparty approvals, and is pretty good at tracking down the appropriate lawyer if you can't.
