I interviewed <NAME/> <NAME/> and Zoya Raynes.  Here are my comments:

<NAME/> <NAME/>:  Has a lot of experience with quantitative and technical analysis.  Programming and language 
          skills.  If not a trader could be an asset to research group.

Zoya Raynes:  Has already been through Salomon's rotational program.  Her interest lean more towards 
          marketing than trading.  Seems very talented.

I would recommend both candidates for further consideration.
