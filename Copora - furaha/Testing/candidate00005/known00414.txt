Who in ENA leadership could we talk with about finding a "champion" for <NAME/> Engheim (environmental permitting), <NAME/> <NAME/> and <NAME/> Kingerski?  <NAME/> Kean is talking to <NAME/> <NAME/> about <NAME/>.  Who else - maybe <NAME/> <NAME/> on gas for <NAME/> Kingerski and <NAME/> <NAME/>?

Let me know.
