Attached are forms of resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage agreements, together with a form of authorized traders list.  I don't know if <NAME/> told you or not, but we typically require two signatories to open brokerage accounts.  Presently, our resolutions reflect <NAME/> Schultz, Vice President of Risk Assessment and Control Group, a Division of <NAME/> Corp. as being authorized, however, we have just learned that she hasn't been officially elected to this office, so in the interim, we will have <NAME/> Buy be our second signature.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
