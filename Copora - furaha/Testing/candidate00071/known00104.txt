

We are finalizing the master netting agreement among BNP Paribas and <NAME/> Corp., et al for execution, and have received copies of all underlying documentation with the exception of documentation for <NAME/> Metals Limited.  Can you fax or e-mail me a copy of what documentation <NAME/> Metals Limited signs--ISDA, general terms and conditions, etc. with BNP Paribas?   We need to receive this documentation ASAP.

Thanks for your help.
