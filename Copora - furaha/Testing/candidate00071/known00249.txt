Attached is a copy of the Master Netting Agreement among BNP Paribas and <NAME/> North America Corp., et al.  It is imperative that this master netting agreement be executed as soon as possible tomorrow morning (11/27), so I am asking your assistance in getting this document signed.  The UK entities to sign are EEFT, <NAME/> Capital & Trade Resources Limited, <NAME/> Credit Limited and <NAME/> Metals Limited.  Please leave the signature pages as set forth on the attached document, as <NAME/> Metals may be deleted from the agreement.  At this point, we aren't sure, so we will have it sign on a separate page and then if they are not a party to the agreement, we will omit their signature page.  

Please take whatever steps are necessary to have the attached document signed ASAP.  <NAME/> <NAME/> (713/345-2679 is the lawyer here in <NAME/> who prepared the document.  Please contact either <NAME/>, <NAME/> Cook (713/345-7732), <NAME/> Sager (713/853-6349) or <NAME/> St. <NAME/> (713/853-3989) if you have any questions.  <NAME/> <NAME/> is the Credit contact and his number is (713) 853-3831.

When the document is signed, please fax the signature pages to me at (713) 646-3490.

MANY THANKS!!!!!!!
