Pursuant to my voice mail, <NAME/> <NAME/> is finalizing a Master Netting Agreement with Dynegy that is to be signed by ECTRIC and ECT Resources Limited.  It appears that <NAME/> Sherriff is an officer of both entities.  <NAME/> you assist us in getting this document signed by initialling, if appropriate, and obtaining signatures and faxing a signed copy back to us at (713) 646-3490?

If you have any questions, please call eitherHarlan <NAME/> at (713) 345-2679 or <NAME/> Cook at (713) 345-7732.
