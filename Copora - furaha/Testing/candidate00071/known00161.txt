

I am preparing the information on the Company Account Application and have a question regarding the address section.  I have completed the section regarding ECT Investment's "principal executive office" (<NAME/> address) and would like to know how this differs, or if it differs, from the address of "registered office".  Would you explain the difference, if any?

Thank you.
