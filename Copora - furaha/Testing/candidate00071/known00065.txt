

<NAME/>:

In connection with the upcoming <NAME/> Corp. Board Meeting, we have prepared proposed resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts on behalf of <NAME/> Corp.  The current resolutions are outdated because certain of the offices no longer exist or have changed.  In addition, <NAME/> Hickerson's group typically goes to <NAME/> Fastow when documents need to be signed or written or oral instructions need to be given to brokers to authorize the transfer of funds from <NAME/> Corp.'s brokerage account(s), in particular the account at Morgan <NAME/>.  <NAME/>'s title has changed and he has also asked that <NAME/> Glisan and <NAME/> DeSpain be authorized to sign documents and to give instructions in connection with these brokerage accounts.

The attached resolutions have been drafted using the December 13, 1994 resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts, with the exception of the deletion of non-existing offices, change in officer titles and the addition of <NAME/> Glisan and <NAME/> DeSpain.  I am attaching a copy of the certificate we sent to Morgan <NAME/> in connection with the opening of the account for <NAME/> Corp. certifying the December 13, 1994 resolutions. 

Thanks for your assistance and, please let us know if you have any questions or need any additional documentation.
