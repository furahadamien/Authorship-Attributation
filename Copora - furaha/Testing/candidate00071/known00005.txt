

<NAME/>:

<NAME/> received a request from FPL's outside counsel in March asking to execute an ISDA for the entity that trades for the non-regulated business units of the regulated entity, Florida Power & Light Co.  He is offering the guaranty of FPL Group Capital Inc.  <NAME/> sent a copy of her Lotus Notes entry to you all asking someone to respond.  Today, she received another e-mail re status?  <NAME/> worked on the Florida Power & Light Co. master.  Do you know who is or will be working on this, assuming it is something we want to do?

Thanks!
