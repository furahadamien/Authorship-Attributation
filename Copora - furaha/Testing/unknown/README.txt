Accompanying this should be testing data for the Authorship Attribution subtask of PAN/CLEF 2012.   Specifically,

* Problems A-D are traditional authorship attribution problems as described in prevoius README; problem B is open-class version of problem A and hence shares training data.   Similarly, problem D is open-class version of problem C..

* Problem E is a mixed set of paragraphs by individual authors; the exact number of authors involved varies from 2-4.  Paragraphs by any individual author are NOT guaranteed to be in original order -- i.e. paragraph 7 of the document may be paragraph 14 of the source document X, while paragraph 12 may be paragraph 3 or the same source document X.

* Problem F involves consecutive intrusive paragraphs by a single (intrusive) author into a document by a single (matrix) author; original ordering is preserved.

* Problems G and H were discarded for technical reasons.

* Problems I and J are novel-length traditional authorship attribution problems attached as a supplement.   As before, problem I is closed-class, problem J is the open-class equivalent.

Any issues please contact the PAN organizers.

Thank you.
