I just wanted to follow up with you that everyone in <NAME/>'s group (plus <NAME/> Dowd) have a place to land when we move.  I have not seen the area that you guys are supposed to move and I just want to make sure that no one falls through the crack.  Are you satisfied that you have spaces for all?  

Thanks, <NAME/>.
