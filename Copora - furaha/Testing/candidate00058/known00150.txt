FYI, the Risk Management and Reporting was allocated to TW for all 12 months of 2001.  However, since I came back to TW in May, Lee Ferrell left <NAME/> in June and <NAME/> and <NAME/> moved to <NAME/>'s RC in November, the 15% number dwindled during the latter part of the year.  <NAME/> and Bobby were the only ones in this RC that were part of this allocation all 12 months. 

Thanks, <NAME/>.
