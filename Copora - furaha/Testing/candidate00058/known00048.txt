

<NAME/>,

Although we skimmed the surface on board replacements for <NAME/>, we should probably start a list of potential candidates.  Some of the names we mentioned last night were:

<NAME/> Tarter
<NAME/> Fenberg
Muffin <NAME/>

Any other names that come to mind?

.....<NAME/> Eucker, <NAME/>, <NAME/> Semi, <NAME/> Brown, <NAME/> O'Neill... are other people who have been involved in various efforts.  Your thoughts?

Thanks, <NAME/>.
