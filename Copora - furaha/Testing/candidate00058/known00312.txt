Well, TK celebrated 20 years with <NAME/> on January 11.  I did talk with <NAME/> about the status of service awards, and of course, they were suspended in December.  <NAME/> said that they are having discussions about what to do in the future.  It may be a while before this program gets reinstated (if at all).  Until it does, may we go ahead and plan a lunch or something nice for TK?
