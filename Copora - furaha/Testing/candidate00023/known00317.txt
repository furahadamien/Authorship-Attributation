

<NAME/>,

He looks like a well qualified candidate but we receive
hundreds of such resumes. The way to
distinguish between different candidates is to ask
the question: Did an individual make an effort
and invested his time to learn things directly  useful
to <NAME/>?

Given our work load, I would not accept a person
who has general quantitative skills but expects that
<NAME/> will train him from ground zero in all other
disciplines. We had recently a candidate who wrote a letter
and complained about being asked questions about
energy economics, finance, etc. during an interview.

We can interview the candidate over the phone and see if he knows anything
beyond math.
