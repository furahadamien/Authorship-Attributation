<NAME/> Lambie, <NAME/> <NAME/>, <NAME/> Cowan, and <NAME/> <NAME/> will be managing products.  All Canadian traders will need transaction capabilities.  I do not think that any "view only" access will be needed.

Thank you,

<NAME/>


PS. I am moving to <NAME/> permanently tomorrow and will have to pass this responsibility off to <NAME/> Lambie.
