I do not believe <NAME/> Shim is there employee to rank for termination.  Until last week, <NAME/> Shim was in the Trading Track program on loan to <NAME/> Hall and logistics.  If they were trying to meet quota by terminating <NAME/>, then I think they need to look elsewhere.  The Trading group should be making the decision on whether or not we fire Trading Track employees.  We just put <NAME/> on a performance plan and ranked her in the Associate/Analyst PRC on Monday.  

Let me know,
