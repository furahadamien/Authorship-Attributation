

In light of the current circumstances with the company and the concerns that our counterparties have at this time, I would like to leave the upstream business in <NAME/>.  Moving this business would lead to confusion with our customers and to our <NAME/> based employees.  Let me know if you have any issues with this.

If you would like to go up there for coordination and training, then feel free to travel to <NAME/>.

Thanks,
<NAME/>
