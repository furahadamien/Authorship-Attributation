Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are checking travel schedules for <NAME/> Luce and <NAME/> Y. to see if we can catch both in <NAME/> sometime next week.  <NAME/> Piper suggests a meeting with all origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

Gas			<NAME/> Vickers (East)
			<NAME/> Luce (Central)
			<NAME/> Tycholiz (West)

Derivatives		<NAME/> LaGrasta

Power		<NAME/> Duran
			Ozzie Pagan
			<NAME/> Baughman
			<NAME/> Shuckley 

Portland		<NAME/> Calger

Calgary		Ladain

Mexico		<NAME/> Y. 

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy and <NAME/>.  I also want to share this info with <NAME/> Shults and his EOL marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with <NAME/> Mrha and <NAME/> Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  

Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you would like.  --<NAME/>
