I don't want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us.  <NAME/>'s letter (noted below) is a good idea, but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year.  I will find out who the recruiter is for UT MBA's and I will get copies of the students' resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter.  --<NAME/>
