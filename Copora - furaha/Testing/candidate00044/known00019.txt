

<NAME/> Shanker called today and wants to spend Tuesday through Thursday next week in our office reviewing at a more detailed level the functional responsibilities within Operations and Accounting.  His goal, on behalf of <NAME/> Bisignano (which I am sure that I have misspelled), is to map the job functions that we have into the job functions as they are organized within <NAME/> Smith <NAME/>.  

I told him that we would be glad to work with him.  We will involve <NAME/> Hall, <NAME/> Gossett, <NAME/> White, <NAME/> Reeves and others as needed in these more detailed discussions.  

<NAME/> says that <NAME/> is sending him a functional org chart for his team today.  I will touch base with <NAME/> to make sure we are coordinated on our efforts.    

Is this the entity that had requested org charts that you asked for?  --<NAME/>
