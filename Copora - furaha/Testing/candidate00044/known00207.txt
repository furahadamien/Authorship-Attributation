

<NAME/> Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All business voice mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following tasks:

1)  Please grant <NAME/> Schulte access to <NAME/> Solmonson's voice mail so that she change the access code for retrieving messages so that she can review any incoming voice mail messages and deliver appropriate business responses.  

2)  Please work with <NAME/> Schulte on the process of forwarding all incoming calls on <NAME/> Solmonson's line (713-853-6079) to <NAME/>'s line (x35565) if she so chooses.  She may prefer the ability to check voice mail messages on <NAME/>'s line to having <NAME/>'s line automatically forwarded to her line.  If she chooses not to forward <NAME/>'s line to hers, she will create a new message on <NAME/>'s line that can direct callers to <NAME/>.  

Thanks in advance for you help on this.
