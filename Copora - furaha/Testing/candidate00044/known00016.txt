

It was a pleasure to meet you last week when you were in <NAME/>.   You arrived with a some good advance "press" from <NAME/>, all of which was well founded.  I am glad that your meeting with <NAME/> was fruitful and I am pleased that there may be a fit between <NAME/>'s needs and Vivance's offerings.  I know that <NAME/> is very enthusiastic about the quality product that Viviance delivers, so creating a win-win situation for both companies would be great.  I have e-mailed <NAME/> Martino to keep me posted to the extent there is anything that I can do to help move along the process.  While I won't make the business decision here, I can certainly help to focus attention when needed.  

Let me know when you will be back in <NAME/>.  If you like Mexican food, I can introduce you to the best place in the state for a great meal.  --<NAME/>
