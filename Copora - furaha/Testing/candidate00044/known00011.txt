She is formating info from <NAME/>'s assistant into format that I used for my slides, so you will get these as one presentation.  (<NAME/> has already sent my slides so that you can begin the process of making copies for the binders.)  I think that you already have slides from <NAME/> on CommodityLogic.  We are working on a few slides for the Commercialization Effort - will have those ready as soon as we can.   Thanks, <NAME/>. --<NAME/>
