

Talked with <NAME/> - she will take care of beaming the simulcast onto the big screen for us tomorrow morning.  

I looked at the conference room, and it looks the way we left it yesterday - dirty.  Talked with the security guys and they called to check on cleaning crew. Should be here this afternoon at 2:00, so the room should be clean and neat by tomorrow morning.  

Have sent e-mail notice of meeting - included <NAME/> Mends and <NAME/> <NAME/> since I don't know Paskin's whereabouts and I do know that <NAME/> Pickering won't be here.  Otherwise, <NAME/> and <NAME/> will be out of the loop.  Anyone else who will roll under Paskin that I should include?  

I will also leave voice mail messages on everyone's <NAME/> extension and make calls to home numbers so that everyone will know about the 8:00 am meeting.  

<NAME/> is here - will meet with McConnell at 3:00 on EGM (commercial) cost savings effort.  Not sure that McConnell will meet with <NAME/> W.   <NAME/> will update me after the 3:00 meeting.
