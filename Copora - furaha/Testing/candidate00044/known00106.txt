I also called Philippe Bibi and sent him a copy of the resume.  I am also by way of this e:mail message going to copy <NAME/> Jones on this resume.  <NAME/> heads up HR for <NAME/> Net Works.  Feel free to give <NAME/>, Philippe and <NAME/> a call to add your personal comments about the candidate.  --<NAME/>
