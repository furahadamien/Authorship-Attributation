

Attached please find an invitation to attend a dinner hosted by <NAME/> to honor this year's recipients of the <NAME/> MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships.  This is our third year to work jointly with many of you in the business school to award these scholarships to outstanding students in their second year of the MBA program. One of the highlights to those of us involved from <NAME/> is the dinner that we host to recognize the students and to renew associations with many of you.  I hope that you will be able to join us at The <NAME/> House on Tuesday, October 16 for cocktails at 7:00pm and dinner at 7:30pm.  In attendance from <NAME/> will be <NAME/> Causey and me, plus a few others from our senior management team who will be in <NAME/> conducting our on-campus interviews for <NAME/>'s Analyst Program.  I will send each of you a final list of attendees by the end of this week.
