I have set aside my afternoon to complete the timeline and resource needs, rewrite the presentation to originators, recap our Monday morning meeting on commercialization efforts for this week, work on my game plan for EES and get with <NAME/> Hall to do an update for <NAME/> Redmond on the HPL sale before his Tueday meeting with <NAME/>.  I will share these items with you as I get them checked off my list this afternoon.  --<NAME/>
