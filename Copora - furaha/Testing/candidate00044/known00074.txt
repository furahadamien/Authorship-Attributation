We are glad that she is there to provide some continuity on historical data, but all historical data and forward actions must be confirmed with <NAME/>.  Let me know if you would like me to underscore this with <NAME/>, and I will be glad to.  Might be a good idea to send a note to <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/> stating that legal has named <NAME/> as the point person, but that for appropriate continuity and execution that <NAME/> must be fully involved - and that you have asked <NAME/> to make that part of her responsibility.  Copy <NAME/> on the note.  --<NAME/>
