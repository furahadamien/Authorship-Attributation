Outlined below are the revised topics and revised attendees.  The date, time and location of meetings on the calendars of  <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/> remain unchanged - we have simply reorganized and reordered the ENW topics to be covered to facilitate the most beneifical grouping for understanding ENW's expenses.
