

The last message in this trail is McMahon's note to the Management Committee members regarding allocations and an attached spreadsheet with his proposed acceptance of allocations.  Just FYI.  

I met with <NAME/> Castleman yesterday to get a feel for the areas where McMahon has questions regarding our Net Works budget.  I will pass those along to <NAME/>, <NAME/>, and <NAME/> today, and will copy you two on that note.  Bowen has already reviewed <NAME/> Sweeney's budget for Operations.  <NAME/> reduced his direct costs by $1MM relative to the original budget submitted, and <NAME/> says that <NAME/> and <NAME/> are fine with that one now.  I don't anticipate much conversation around that on Monday.  --<NAME/>
