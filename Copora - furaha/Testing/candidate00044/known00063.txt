This message was sent by <NAME/> Gibson for the December newsletter.  At Monday's board meeting, <NAME/> Ewalt gave me an article about Senior Presentation for the December newsletter.  She doesn't have an electronic copy.  I will try this weekend to retype it as a word document and e-mail it to you.  <NAME/> also said that she had given <NAME/> Petrak a hard copy of a permission slip to be printed in the December newsletter.  (This is for parents to sign for under 17's to be out after midnight as they return from Senior Presentation).  Do you have that?  If not, you might contact <NAME/> and ask her for that.  --<NAME/>
