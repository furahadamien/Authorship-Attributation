Do you want to copy <NAME/> as well, or was <NAME/>'s inclusion due to his previous responsibility over the MPR, which now is managed by <NAME/> Ayala.  Either way, you may want to include <NAME/> on the message just so that he and his team know about the creation of this common drive.  

What about Georgeanne Hodges?  Should she be notified as well?  You may also want to copy <NAME/> as an FYI.  Thanks.
