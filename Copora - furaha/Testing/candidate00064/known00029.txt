In addition, he demonstrated much improved risk management skills that last 6 months of last year.   <NAME/> (working for <NAME/>) is very capable and will do a great job for us in the SE.    <NAME/> Saibi will come over from ERCOT and run the cash books in the SE.
 
I will be happy to talk Marcello to see if there is another fit.    With respect to the NE, I also want to move some of the young guys up - they have worked hard for the past 12-18 months in real-time and fundies roles and deserve a chance before an outside person.
