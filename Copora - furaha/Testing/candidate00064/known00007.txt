	<NAME/>
	<NAME/>
	<NAME/> Black
	<NAME/> Herndon
	<NAME/> <NAME/>
	Joe Wagner
	Narsima Misra
	Jubran Whalan

I recommend a bi-weekly meeting with the group of 6 (Belden, Presto, Lavo, Richter, Black, Herndon).   I will assume <NAME/> will coordinate with the asst's to schedule time and location.
