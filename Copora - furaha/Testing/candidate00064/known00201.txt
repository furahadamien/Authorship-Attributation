

Based on what <NAME/> and <NAME/> are doing, I would increase your #'s significantly.   Your liquidity data is very conservative compared to <NAME/> and <NAME/>.   Your forward volumes are approx. 20% of <NAME/> and <NAME/> and your ST data is about 50%.

I would complete the form based on the liquidity we saw in Aug and Sept.
