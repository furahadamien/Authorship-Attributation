Additionally there has been a substantial amount of restructuring in both EBS and in EES to reduce costs and refocus our business on high value opportunities.  As <NAME/> has said, though, the basic business model and strategy of <NAME/> is sound and promises continued growth -- no changes there.  For example, in the <NAME/> Industrial Markets and <NAME/> Global Markets groups -- efforts begun just over a year ago -- we have already experienced enormous volume and revenue growth and we are making money already in these "first mover" businesses.  Successes like these prove the advantages of our overall strategy and business model.  Combined with some long overdue focus on costs, we should be well on our way to even greater gains in recurring earnings.
