Hopefully, we can all move on now and get back to the work at hand.  As much as I enjoyed working with <NAME/> and looked up to him for his intellectual leadership, I feel like the whole place is energized by <NAME/>'s obvious competence, calm, and heart.  I have never felt better about working here.
