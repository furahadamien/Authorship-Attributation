(<NAME/> Wind is one of the many companies he's responsible for and he is going to be getting more deeply involved, at least on this issue).  I will forward your latest update (originally to <NAME/> Metts), but I think you should provide a new update for <NAME/> as well as a discussion of what we are doing (or should be doing) to get the extension.
