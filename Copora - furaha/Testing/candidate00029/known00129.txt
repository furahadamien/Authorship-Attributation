<NAME/> Ellenberg is the N.Y. Cadwalader lawyer who is assisting <NAME/> on a regular basis (he has an office on our floor and is available through our email system).  <NAME/> has asked <NAME/> <NAME/> with Cadwalader's U.K. office to contact you to explore the possibility of assisting you with ECTRIC and other trading/bankruptcy issues.  I was thinking that the U.S. process for trade termination/evaluation could be replicated in London and a Cadwalader lawyer (with trading experience) could make use of <NAME/>'s experience with pre- and post-filing "<NAME/>" issues.
