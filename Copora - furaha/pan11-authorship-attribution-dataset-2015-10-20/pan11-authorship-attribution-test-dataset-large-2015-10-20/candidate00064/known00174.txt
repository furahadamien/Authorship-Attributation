

Because we have lost several people to retail risk management (<NAME/> Herndon, Narsima Misra, <NAME/> Homco, etc.) and <NAME/> Forney has moved to ERCOT hourly, I have been forced to manage an EOL stack for multiple markets.

Therefore, all tours during trading hours (6:30 am to 3:30 pm) will have to be provided by non-trading personnel.

Sorry, but we are in our busiest season and I cannot afford to have my traders away from the desk for even 10 minutes.
