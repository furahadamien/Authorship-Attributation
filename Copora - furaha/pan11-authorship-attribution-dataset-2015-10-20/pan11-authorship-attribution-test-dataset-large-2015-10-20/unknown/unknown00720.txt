The SAP costs were included in the ETS overhead in Adaytum.  We have taken that out and added to each pipes Corporate Direct.  The cost of $6.0 million will be divided equally amongst the four pipes.  <NAME/> will change all but NBP.  <NAME/> please make change for NBP.  This is per <NAME/>'s instructions.  When we get the user list we will revise.


Thanks

Tracy
