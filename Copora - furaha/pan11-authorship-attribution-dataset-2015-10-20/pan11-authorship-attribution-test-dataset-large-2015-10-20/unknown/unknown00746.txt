<NAME/>,

I am looking for the person who paid for my wine last Friday evening.  <NAME/> says it was not her, so I'm suspecting that it was you.  Needless to say, I left without paying and what is worse, I didn't even think of it until I got home that night after dinner with <NAME/>.  Where you the kind and unknowing one that floated my loan?

Also, I've been thinking about Paris and London.  Would a week night or weekend night be better for you/<NAME/> and <NAME/>/I to get together for a brain, map and book transfer session.  If you have a date that works for you guys over the next few weeks, throw it out and we'll get something on the calendar.  

Thanks, <NAME/>.

P.S.  What is <NAME/>'s email address?  I'd like to send her a note.
