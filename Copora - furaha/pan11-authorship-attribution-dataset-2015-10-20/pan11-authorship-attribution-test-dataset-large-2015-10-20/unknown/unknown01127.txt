<NAME/>:

We would like to use the same format which was agreed to by ENA and CSFB.  That agreement was sent for execution on July 6, 2001 and we have never received an executed version.

Please feel free to contact <NAME/> Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.  Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.  <NAME/> Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.

We have been unable to extract any response from <NAME/> Kreuzinger.

Thanks.
