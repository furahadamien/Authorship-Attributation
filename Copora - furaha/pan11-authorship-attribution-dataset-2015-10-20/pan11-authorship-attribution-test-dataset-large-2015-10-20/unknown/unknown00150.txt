I was just thinking of the mountain of things going on, outside of normal stuff, and I decided to make a list. Here it is:

Formation of International Credit Group- <NAME/>/<NAME/>
Curve Validation Issue-Port/Gorte
Steel Issues-<NAME/>/Gorte
Rocar Progress/Implementation-Gorte
Operational Risk Metrics/Implementation-Curry
EES???-All
Bankruptcy Group-Gorte/<NAME/>/Tribolet/<NAME/>
Retail Credit-<NAME/>/<NAME/>
Private Equity Trading-Gorte
Credit Consistency study- Buy

I think we should have a meeting to discuss above. Some are bigger than others. Organization and website need to adapt to current business environment. 

If anything else belongs on this list let me know. <NAME/> will set up meeting.
