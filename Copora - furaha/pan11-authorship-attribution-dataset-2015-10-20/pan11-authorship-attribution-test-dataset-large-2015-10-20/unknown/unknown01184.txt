Ricki - would you please:

1. Make reservations at 11:45 on Thurs for <NAME/> Johnson & I at Duck & Co in Hyatt

2. Set up a pre-meeting for <NAME/> Hawkins & I before our meeting with <NAME/> tomorrow

3. Move my Wed. staff meeting to run from 10-11:30 (instead of 9-10).  Since we no longer have a Wash office, I plan to watch the Commission meeting myself
