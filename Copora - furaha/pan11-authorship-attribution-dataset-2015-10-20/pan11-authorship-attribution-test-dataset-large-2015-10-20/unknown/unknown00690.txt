<NAME/> Walters: <NAME/> bailout plan is oddest piece of legislation in recent memory



(Published Aug. 29, 2001)

Senate <NAME/> 78XX may be the most unusual legislation to hit the Capitol in decades, in terms of both its content and its convoluted political dynamics.

The measure is the latest incarnation of months-long efforts by Gov. Gray <NAME/> and some legislators to rescue Southern California <NAME/> from joining its larger cousin, Pacific Gas and Electric, in bankruptcy court. That is odd unto itself, since state legislation to openly provide billions of dollars in benefits to one private corporation may be unprecedented.

Literally dozens of versions of legislation to bail out <NAME/> have floated around the Capitol, ever since <NAME/> announced last spring that he had reached agreement with <NAME/> <NAME/>, chairman of <NAME/> International, the utility's parent corporation. The <NAME/> deal was announced just a few days after PG&E rejected <NAME/>' overtures and took itself into bankruptcy court. Both utilities ran up many billions of dollars in debts buying power in the last six months of 2000 because the state rejected their pleas to raise retail rates.

<NAME/>'s -- or perhaps <NAME/>'s -- fear of bankruptcy is another puzzling aspect of the issue, given the almost cheerful manner in which PG&E placed itself in receivership. <NAME/> has spent millions of dollars on lobbying, advertising and other forms of political persuasion, trying to nudge the Legislature into passing a rescue plan that lawmakers are clearly reluctant to do.

Is avoiding bankruptcy a matter of personal pride for <NAME/>? Or, as some suggest, does it stem from <NAME/>'s tardiness in erecting an impregnable financial fire wall between the utility's assets and those of the parent holding company, <NAME/> International? <NAME/> scrambled to build a fire wall after bankruptcy loomed, but financial analysts are uncertain that it's as strong as PG&E's.

The dynamics within the Capitol and among various interest groups are equally odd, following none of the patterns that usually explain why politicians do what they do. Legislators of both parties are all over the map on the <NAME/> issue, and factions that are ordinarily allied find themselves at odds. One example: Liberal consumer groups are strenuously opposing any bailout for the utility, while liberal environmentalists like the current scheme because it would bring thousands of acres of <NAME/>-owned <NAME/> watershed under state control.

Perhaps the most mysterious aspect of the <NAME/> situation is why <NAME/>, ordinarily the most cautious, commitment-averse of politicians, is making such a crusade of keeping the utility out of bankruptcy court. Why would <NAME/> put so much of his gubernatorial prestige behind such an iffy proposition that exposes him to leverage from lawmakers seeking other favors from the governor and, polls indicate, is not popular with voters?

<NAME/> Rosenfield, the consumer gadfly who has established a "war room" near the Capitol to fight the <NAME/> scheme, believes that <NAME/>' unusual efforts stem from a desire to run for president in 2004 and a fear that Wall Street would blackball him if <NAME/> follows PG&E into bankruptcy court.

Another possible explanation is <NAME/>' decades-long relationship with <NAME/>. The two served together in former Gov. Jerry Brown's administration (<NAME/> was Brown's Public Utilities Commission president) and both have strong ties to the Democratic political organization in West Los Angeles headed by Reps. <NAME/> Waxman and <NAME/> Berman, who, in effect, allowed <NAME/> to launch his career by winning a West Side state Assembly seat in 1982.

The most influential member of <NAME/>'s board of directors is <NAME/> <NAME/>, a Democratic elder statesman and former secretary of state. <NAME/> and <NAME/> flew to Sacramento late last year to plead with <NAME/> to take command of the energy crisis, allow utilities to raise rates and staunch the red ink. <NAME/> refused, and nearly a year later finds himself trying to keep <NAME/> out of bankruptcy court.

We may never know why <NAME/> is going to bat for <NAME/>, but we will know, very soon, whether he can pull it off or will wind up with egg on his face.
