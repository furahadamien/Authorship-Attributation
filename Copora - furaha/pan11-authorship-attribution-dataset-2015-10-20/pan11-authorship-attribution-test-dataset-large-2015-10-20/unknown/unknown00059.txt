<NAME/>,

Attached is the (long-awaited) spec for the 200K gallons of low-sulphur #2 Fuel Oil to partially refill the tank at the Ft. <NAME/> facility in Florida.
As the attached note describes, the final spec is a result of the combined spec requirements by the environmental permit, MHI (Mitsubishi), and Engineering.

We currently believe that some of these specs may be more stringent than what is commercially available.  In the event that some of these specs are too stringent, we would like you to: 1) identify which specs are not reasonably attainable, and 2) suggest what value of these specs are attainable.   Your feedback will be shared with the appropriate parties and, assuming there are spec change recommendations, these parties will determine how best to proceed.  

Please note that the first attached note requests than any bids we get contain info on density, heating value, and trace contaminants.  Additionally, the second attached note references getting multiple bids for different specs.  I suggest that, for now, we resolve the spec issue internally as described above and then we obtain quotes.   If you have any other suggestions on how best to proceed, your input is welcome.

Your assistance in this matter is, and has been, greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

<NAME/> <NAME/>
