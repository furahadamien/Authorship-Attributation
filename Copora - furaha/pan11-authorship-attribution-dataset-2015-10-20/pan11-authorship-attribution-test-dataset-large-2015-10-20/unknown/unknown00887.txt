Has our draft letter gone to the CFTC?  I assume it already has, but unfortunately it turns out <NAME/>'s comments were not in the version of the letter that I forwarded to you.  I have taken a look at them and am not sure they are critical but thought I'd better get them to you in case we send a revised letter down the road.
