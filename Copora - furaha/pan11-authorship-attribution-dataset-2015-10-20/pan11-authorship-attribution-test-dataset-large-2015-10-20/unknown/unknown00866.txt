<NAME/>,
 
I am glad you sent me this message. It will help to clarify a few issues.
 
1. I was contacted by <NAME/> (this means I did not start this phase of the process)
    last Friday, as far as I can remember.
 
    <NAME/> expressed interest in joining the Research Group. I told him two things:
       a. We would be delighted to have him here.
       b. Our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives
           your blessing before we can move ahead.
    We agreed to have a conference call Wed morning, your time, with you, <NAME/> and
    <NAME/> Roberts.
 
  2. Wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by <NAME/>. <NAME/> and I decided to call you
      anyway Thu morning your time, directly, to discuss the matter. I was in a PRC all afternoon and 
      asked <NAME/> to call you  in case I could not sneak out to join him. <NAME/> called and was
      told you were out sick.
 
 3. I am leaving in a few hours for California. I shall be driving back to <NAME/> for the next
     3 days. Please, feel free to call <NAME/> an discuss this matter with  him in my absence.
 
 4. I think <NAME/> has a strong preference to be in the Research Group, assuming he moves to
     <NAME/>. I think he came to this conclusion after visiting <NAME/> in early July. I did not 
     bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here.
 
     I can  understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account. But the
     first  issue is if he can leave Sydney at all.
 
I hope it helps. Cheers.
 
 
<NAME/>
