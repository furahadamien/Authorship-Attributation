In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in conversations around CommodityLogic.

Two of the Project Managers on the team, <NAME/> Slagle and <NAME/> <NAME/>, were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to <NAME/> Price.  Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing both <NAME/> and <NAME/> well, I viewed them as valuable members of the operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most appropriately .  <NAME/> Price and I worked together to sell <NAME/> and <NAME/> on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very quickly.  

One of the key team members working under <NAME/> Slagle on NomLogic was a scheduler on our gas team (<NAME/>).  <NAME/> Hall, our opeartions controller over natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since <NAME/> and <NAME/> have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and <NAME/> Superty, who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  <NAME/> looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently renamed it NomLogic.  <NAME/> had been a member of the Contract Exchange project team, and we transfered her along with the project to CommodityLogic.  

Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is input from my group that has created the modules by defining user requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.   

In the fall, I assigned <NAME/> Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed <NAME/>'s participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, <NAME/> was the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to CommodityLogic, <NAME/> developed a plan for ContactLogic that <NAME/> feels is excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  

Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - <NAME/> Reeves, who played a significant role in building <NAME/>'s power business from day one, and <NAME/> Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and back office operations.   <NAME/> <NAME/> and <NAME/> Slagle were their replacements on CommodityLogic.
