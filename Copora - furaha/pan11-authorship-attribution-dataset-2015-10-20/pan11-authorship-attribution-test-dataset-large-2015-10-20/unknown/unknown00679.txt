<NAME/>, Congratulations on the story in the Times.

FYI.  Today's radio media (local and national) are all giving the same basic message that:

"<NAME/> got beat up in FERC negotiations; judge sides decidedly with generators; <NAME/> team trying in vain to spin it their way, but it's clear they lost. "

<NAME/> was pathetic on the radio this morning.  Interviewers weren't buying his BS at all.

Best,
<NAME/>
