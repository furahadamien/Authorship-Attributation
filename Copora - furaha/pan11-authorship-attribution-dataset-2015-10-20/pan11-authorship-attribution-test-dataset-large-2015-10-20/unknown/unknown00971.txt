I want to keep track of summer interns.  Please make me a desk file.  This list is missing summer interns under <NAME/>.  I have asked <NAME/> to send me an updated list.  I have also sent her a message letting her know that <NAME/> <NAME/> now reports into <NAME/> Zipper and that she needs to communicate with <NAME/> and <NAME/> directly regarding <NAME/> Carlson's internship.  

Also, did you keep copies of resumes of the analysts?  Can you pull resumes for the interns that will be assigned to us?  I would like to review them.  

I also want to hold a meeting later this week with all supervisors who will have interns reporting to them.  Please check with the listed supervisor on <NAME/>'s list.  If one of their direct reports will actually be the primary supervisor, please get that name.  Thanks. -<NAME/>
