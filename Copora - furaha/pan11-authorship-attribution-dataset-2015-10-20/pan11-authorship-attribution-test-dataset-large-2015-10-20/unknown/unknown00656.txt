Hi <NAME/>,

Is this order because <NAME/>'s desk top has been slow and she has not been able to keep the Dashboard and other applications open at the same time?

Also, I would like to inquire with you about ordering two flat screens for <NAME/>.  He would like to still keep his laptop computer.  Can we accomodate two flat screens with his laptop?

Have you settled down from all the moves?  Where did you and <NAME/> end up?  <NAME/> you be with us on 13?  

As always, many, many thanks!  <NAME/>.

P.S.  The printers all got worked out?  Everybody happy?  :>)
