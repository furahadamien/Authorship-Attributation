Based on my review of the files, we do not have signed agreements for the following:

<NAME/> Alonso*
<NAME/> Fischer*
<NAME/> <NAME/>
<NAME/> Luce
<NAME/> McDonald
Narsimha Misra
<NAME/> Parquet
<NAME/> Penman
<NAME/> Vickers
<NAME/> Zipper

Would you mind asking the vault if they have these?  If not, could you get with Knudsen to get them?

Thanks.  (By the way, no one should know why).

Thanks a lot!!
