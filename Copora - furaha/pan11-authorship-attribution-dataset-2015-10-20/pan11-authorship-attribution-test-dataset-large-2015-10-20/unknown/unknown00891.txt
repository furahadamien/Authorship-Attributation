I am not familiar with <NAME/> Re but on the offset side I'd be concerned about (1) different creditors for ENA and <NAME/> Re and (2)  ENA's offset position (with respect to the Creditor's Committee).  I am not certain that we have clarified the estate's setoff position.  Also, are the receivable and trades related?  <NAME/>
