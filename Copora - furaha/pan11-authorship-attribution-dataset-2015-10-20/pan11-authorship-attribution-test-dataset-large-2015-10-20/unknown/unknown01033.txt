Hi Georgi,

It's nice to hear from you -- although I wish it were under happier circumstances from your end.  I know that your visited with <NAME/> and <NAME/> on gas control openings.  Please also keep in touch with <NAME/> Dietz for contract group openings and <NAME/> Blair for potential scheduling openings.  I'll also touch base with them and let them know that you may be responding to upcoming job postings.
