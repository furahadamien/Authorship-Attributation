Hi

<NAME/> is having an access violation when he tries to run the Path Confirmation Report. Vish is aware of this, and wants to do some investigating tomorrow, but I don't know if <NAME/> will have time.  Maybe you can do this with Vish and <NAME/>'s Passwords?

Stacy still has performance issues running the report launcher locally.


I am just ducky.
