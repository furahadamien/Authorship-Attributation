<NAME/>:

Please call me in the morning.  I need to verify:

1.	Was this an ENA transaction?

2.	What is the actual account number?

3. 	What happened to the money when it hit the BofA account?  I think you said it was swept into a Citibank account.  Was this an ENA or ENE account?

4.  	Where is the money today?

Thanks.
