I've attached <NAME/>'s most recent version (from Friday) of the PowerPoint presentation I put together and I've incorporated Tracy's comments (from yesterday).  <NAME/> Matthews had drafted a history for Tracy - it appears on a slide in the presentation.

This is all we have as far as a basic overview and history.
