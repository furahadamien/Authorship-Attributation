i've been doing nothing for two months (literally) and should be trading again in a few weeks, so i've got to start preparing for that, which is a welcome change.  

what do you mean you're not doing anything this w/e?  i like the bar scene alot, but i have to be drunk to enjoy it.  i think one night a week its good if you have nothing better to do.  i think some of the boys from enron are going out this sat. if you end up having nothing to do.  we'll be moving in this w/e, you should come by and check it out.  

as for chrissy, that was the sound of my cock puncturing the desk and knocking my mouse on its side.  

dingy pub would have been good - do you have a favorite?  i like the auburn saloon, but jai hates it. so ...  it took us *forever* to get out of the parking lot.  brutal.
