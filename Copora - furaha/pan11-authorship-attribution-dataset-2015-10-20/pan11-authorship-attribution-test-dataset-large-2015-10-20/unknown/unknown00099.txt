I know there is lots going on but I would like to resign from the Board of Mariner asap. I am having trouble devoting enough time to this function and feel it would be better if I turned it over to someone else. <NAME/> Gorte in my group would be my recommendation as a replacement. If <NAME/> does not have an interest, <NAME/> Larson could also fill in. Any thoughts? If you have no issues I will proceed. Thanks, <NAME/>
