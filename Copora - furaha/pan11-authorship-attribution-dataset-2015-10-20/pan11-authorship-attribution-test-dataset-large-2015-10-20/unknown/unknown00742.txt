<NAME/>,

Here are the bankruptcy post-id's that need to be calculated tonight.  You probably don't have access to the Canadian book so you can get it from <NAME/> or use my computer.  The right one has portcalc up, kkeiser & tamu96ddd.

They might need to be on inexact for basis and index.
Once those are done, can you email the id #'s to <NAME/> Powell, <NAME/> Brackett and <NAME/> McGinnis?

Thanks
