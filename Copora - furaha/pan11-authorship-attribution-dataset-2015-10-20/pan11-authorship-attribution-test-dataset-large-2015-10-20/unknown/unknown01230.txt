<NAME/>:

<NAME/> <NAME/> (785/575-8128) at Western Resources left me a voice mail stating that they want to finalize the master netting agreement ASAP.  <NAME/> Cook is assigning this to <NAME/> Koehler to work on.  <NAME/> you send me a list of counterparties involved and agreements you show are in place?

Thanks!
