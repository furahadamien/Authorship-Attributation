How are you?!  It's so good to hear from you.  Of course I get the updates from <NAME/>y & I knew about your new job.  I hope everything is going well there.  <NAME/> said that you really liked it.  I thought of Florabama when I heard you were hired at <NAME/>.  Lucky we didn't do anything truly offensive (I don't think) in our negotiations with them.  We need to meet you for lunch someday.

It would be great to see <NAME/> too, if we could get ahold of him.  He called the other day with a building question.  He sounded good and said <NAME/> had some irons in the fire.

Everything here is...wierd!!  And it's pretty sad.  The NNG commercial people go over (red rover, red rover) to Dynegy starting Friday.  (This would include <NAME/> <NAME/> - talk about a midlife crisis!)  It's all pretty sad (along with Lay resignation, Baxter suicide, etc.)  The new guy started today - who knows?!

How is <NAME/>?  It looks like Calpine is holding their own.  I've left some messages for <NAME/>, but haven't heard back from her.

<NAME/> is wonderful.  He is talking alot and he's very busy!!  My dad and my stepmom, Flo, were here this last weekend for a visit.  <NAME/> and I got to go out to dinner and to a movie - WOW!

Thanks for keeping in touch.  Let's rally the troops soon for a ladies luncheon.
