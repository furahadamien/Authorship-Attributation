<NAME/> and <NAME/>:

I need someone to please look into the following trades with various <NAME/> entities (other than ENA) identified by <NAME/> Ng of Morgan and whether these were booked incorrectly or should properly be booked in the names of the following affiliates:

<NAME/> Liquids
<NAME/> Reserve Acquisition Corp. (oil option)
EOTT (I think EOTT documents its financial deals separately)

Also, there have been trades for physical settlement, such as, an "oil forward" and a "gas TBP forward".  Maybe <NAME/> knows the answer to this one.

Thanks.
