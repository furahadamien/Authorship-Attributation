<NAME/>:

Your redraft is fine with two exceptions:

(1)  We need to define "business day"  which is used throughout the agreement and is never defined.  I propose capitalizing the term throughtout your document and using the ISDA definiton or one which recognizes those days on which banks are open in NY and <NAME/>.

(2)  ENA cannot agree to arbitrate before the National Futures Association and you are no longer required to use that forum for arbitration. The situs is fine. I would like to again suggest the language which I originally proposed.  If we cannot agree, can we be silent as to jurisdiction?

Please let me hear form you.
