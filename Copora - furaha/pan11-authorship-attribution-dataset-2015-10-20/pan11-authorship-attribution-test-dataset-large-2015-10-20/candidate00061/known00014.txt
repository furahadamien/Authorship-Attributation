

Can we all plan to get on the phone with <NAME/> tomorrow (Thurs) at 10:00 to discuss some questions with <NAME/> about East of CA?  We've apparently been inconsistent in our interpretation for different purposes (reporting and system mod's, etc.) and want to get it all straight.

<NAME/>, can you come to th 13th floor and then we'll grab a room/table/office and call <NAME/>?

Thanks!
