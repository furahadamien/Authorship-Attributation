	Thank you so much for sharing!  I can't tell you what a sweet boy he is!! I have the picture of him today (with his eyes open) as my screen saver.  Everyone in my office is in love with <NAME/>!
	Well, I hope you are okay and have maybe caught up on some sleep.  Hopefully, <NAME/> will be a good sleeper.  I told <NAME/> that this was enough to make me want to get on a plane.  Maybe <NAME/>, <NAME/> & I will be able to come visit soon.  I'm so excited that <NAME/> will have a cousin near his age.  He has Riley (turned 2 yrs. on Oct 4th) and Peyton (was 3 yrs. in June) who are brothers and live in San <NAME/> (<NAME/>'s brother <NAME/>'s boys).  But we are thinking that we've never been to Memphis and it would be a great place to visit!
	<NAME/> is doing wonderfully.  As everyone will tell you, they grow up so fast.  Just enjoy every moment - these boys are little miracles!  <NAME/> has started saying alot of words (moon, house, ball, cookie, crackers, buckle) and he is going to be a lion for halloween - he's been practicing his roar.  What will <NAME/> be?  <NAME/> is also trying to put on his shoes and socks.  He is fascinated with buckles - he can buckle, but not unbuckle yet.  He is almost riding his tricycle.
	Everything else is good here.  My mom and <NAME/> have started driving here today.  They will get to <NAME/> tomorrow night.  <NAME/> is driving the Corvair in a parade Saturday and then, of course, we are watching the Baylor game.
	I'm so glad to hear your mom and dad are coming this weekend.  I bet they cannot wait.  I hope they are able to visit often.  It is so important to me that <NAME/> knows my mom, <NAME/>, my dad & Flo.  I was so lucky to get to grow-up with my grandparents in town and I wish that <NAME/> will have the same.
	Have fun with sweet <NAME/> and take care of <NAME/>.  It sounds like you all are doing great!

Love,
<NAME/>
