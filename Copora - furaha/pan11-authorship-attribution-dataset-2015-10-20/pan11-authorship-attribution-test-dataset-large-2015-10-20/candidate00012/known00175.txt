Kam had mentioned that you are in the process of recruiting for several clients in the energy industry.  I have roughly 4 years experience in the industry with 2.5 of those years in risk management.  Prior to employment with <NAME/>, I worked for a big six accounting firm and in the healthcare industry for the University of Texas.  I am interested in staying in the energy field.  If you think one of your clients might be interested, I would like to send my resume on to you.  If they or you are not interested, I apologize for taking up your time today.  Thanks and I hope to hear from you soon.
