

<NAME/>,

Attached are all live financial deals by risk type.  As you can see, the price data is too large to fit into one tab.  

After tomorrow, I will no longer have access to the estate files.  <NAME/> Couch will be taking over the responsibility for the estate risk group and will be able to assist you with your requests going forward.
