I put some question marks next to <NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/>'s products.  You have them down as managing some physical products.  <NAME/> they be managing those physical books?
If not, they should go to the physical trader managing that location as before. 

Can you take a look at those?
