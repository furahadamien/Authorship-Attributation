I believe that all but one of the amendments/bonus memo documents are complete.  The only one in question is for <NAME/> Redmond, whose contract we did not have.  <NAME/> is going to pull the contract in the morning and give it to Twanda.  Twanda will prepare the draft amendment and change to the memo and get it to Kriste for finalizing.  

Then (I hope) we'll be done!!!!

Thanks.

<NAME/>
