Diomedes was not eligible for severance because of outstanding expense reports -- approximately $400K.  I know that <NAME/> was involved in this to great detail.

Once the expense report issue is clarified, then he would be eligible for regular severance.  <NAME/> and <NAME/> Callahan have been coordinating those issues.
