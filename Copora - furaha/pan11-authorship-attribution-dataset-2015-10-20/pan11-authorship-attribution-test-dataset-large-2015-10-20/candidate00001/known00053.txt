      I truly wish that I had something in my shop for you, but I don't.  Try <NAME/> Roberts at Entergy (281)-297-3120, <NAME/> Kinder at Kinder Morgan (713)369-9000, or you could try Anadarko in the Woodlands.  I know that <NAME/> is still hiring, too.  The other alternative is to look outside the industry, which is probably a good idea at this point.  You could also contact Joe Sutton and see if you could get some leads from him.  In any event, let me know if there is something that I can do.  I wish you the best of luck in your search--we'll keep you in our prayers until we've heard that you're fine, so let us know.

     Take care.

<NAME/>
