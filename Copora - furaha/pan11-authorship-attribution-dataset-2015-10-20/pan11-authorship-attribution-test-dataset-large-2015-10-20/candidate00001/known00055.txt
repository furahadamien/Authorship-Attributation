     I hate losing <NAME/>, but the most important thing is keeping him here.  As you know, he was an EDS employee assigned to <NAME/> until about 1999.  As such, he didn't receive all of the equity upsides that his counterparts did.  I know a lot of people  have, and will continue to, make runs at <NAME/>.  So do what you can to keep him a happy <NAME/> employee.  Thanks.
