    Check and see if PROFITX software is on <NAME/>'s computer (the icon will be on his windows screen).  If so, find out if he uses it and let <NAME/> know.  <NAME/> is trying to get it removed from a number of systems as the support for the software is $135.00/mo., and it is not a critical tool for us.  Thanks.

    If you need to reach me the afternoon, you can get me from 3:30 on at 713-345-3271.
