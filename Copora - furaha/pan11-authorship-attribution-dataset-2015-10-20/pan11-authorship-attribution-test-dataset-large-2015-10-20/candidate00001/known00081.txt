      <NAME/> will be reporting into the Asset Development Group (which is you), but as you well know--we tend to blur alot of lines around here.  It is important to TCPL and all of the others to know that <NAME/> does have direct access to <NAME/> and me.  This is consistent with what <NAME/> had originally talked to <NAME/> about.  Okay?
