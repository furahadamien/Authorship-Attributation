

Sorry I missed you today.

Looking forward to lunch tomorrow.  <NAME/> 11:45 at La Grilia suit you?

Have fun at your event tonight.

Also - mea culpa.  I just replaced my daytimer calendar for 2002 and realized that I missed <NAME/>'s birthday.  I hope that wasn't the day we were all over at your house.  Oops.  Wish <NAME/> a belated greeting on us and of course congrats on his promotion.

See you tomorrow.
