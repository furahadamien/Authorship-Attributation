I've had a change in my schedule today and I won't drop off the check in person.  I deposited the <NAME/> check in my bank account this am on my way to work (to make sure I get the cash before any bankruptcy filing) and will have a personal check couriered over to your office.

Unless you instruct otherwise, I will make the check out to Salomon Smith <NAME/> and put the caption FBO <NAME/> Corman in the Memo line of check.  Let me know if an account number should appear on the check.
