Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday.  <NAME/> had soccer practice last night & I have something I must do tonight.  I'm taking the day off tomorrow.  Would there be a good time to visit tomorrow?  When is <NAME/> home from school - so he and <NAME/> could play.  Or, if you'd rather, I'd be happy to sit with <NAME/> or the kids anytime this weekend.

Two other items when you get a chance:
-Are you still selling Nutcraker tickets?  I can't recall the date.
-Are you still interested in me selling Shopping Cards at <NAME/>.  I need to reserve dates/table space in lobby.

<NAME/> all is well.  Talk to you soon.

<NAME/>
