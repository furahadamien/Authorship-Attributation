

I have been friends with <NAME/> Corman since 1985.  We have worked together and maintained a personal friendship through the year.  <NAME/> is a kind and loving person.  She is active in her church and in charitable activities.  I met her husband, <NAME/> Erb, in 1997 and have been friends with <NAME/> and <NAME/> as a couple since that time.  Both <NAME/> and <NAME/> are loving parents to their six-year old son <NAME/>.  It has been a delight to watch them raise <NAME/> to be such a fine young man.  I believe that their home would provide a terrific environment for an adopted child.
