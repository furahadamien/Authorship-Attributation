I gave my mom a heads up that "flat <NAME/>" would be arriving in the mail soon -- but it seems like
recent mail jitters are coming into play.  Before poor <NAME/> is needlessly tossed on fears of biological
terrorism could you confirm whether Master <NAME/> might be in a brown envelope?  I didn't have Ms. Jung's
email.

<NAME/> all is well with you.  I am so pleased with how happy <NAME/> is with school.  At first he expected to be 
coddled like Kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard.  Boy how things have changed in a month.
Yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard -- Kindergarten was soooooo boring.

I really appreciate the firm, yet compassionate manner you have with the kids.  It is just what <NAME/> needs to develop.

While I'm writing, I will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school.  Over the summer we hosted
a 4-year old orphan girl (<NAME/>) from Kazakhstan.  She had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her.  The other day, <NAME/> was watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children.  He commented how much they look
like <NAME/> and then burst out in tears.  If the school works on a project for the Afghan kids, <NAME/> may seem a little more emotional than usual -- just wanted you to know.

Regards,

<NAME/> Corman  (<NAME/>'s Mom)
