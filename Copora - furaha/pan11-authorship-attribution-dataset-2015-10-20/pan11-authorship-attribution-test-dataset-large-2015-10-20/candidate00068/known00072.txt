Does this create any problems for you?  Given the current uncertainty about NETCO headcount and considering any transition issues you may have with <NAME/> leaving, I thought we should leave things the way they are for now but develop a transfer date to be in a week or two.  If you are OK with this move, I would like <NAME/> to spend part of his time next week downloading from <NAME/> as I have him through next Friday.

On another matter, I believe <NAME/> has E-mailed you about an agency agreement that we have with Cleburne Plant that needs to be transitioned to the estate.  He knows the details as does <NAME/> Hill (I believe he is in your group).  We should probably get someone else in your group plugged into this deal (<NAME/> Kelly?), to handle to the administration of this deal.  We should try to identify someone quickly so that he/she can download from <NAME/> next week.
