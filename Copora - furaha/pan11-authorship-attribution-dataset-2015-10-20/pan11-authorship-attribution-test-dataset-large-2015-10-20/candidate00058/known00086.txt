

<NAME/>,  all is correct except that <NAME/> <NAME/> should get two flat screens instead of <NAME/> and me getting a third panel.  However, I did want to mention to you that I would like for <NAME/> to have a third flat screen since she handles all of our EOL transactions thereby giving her a screen for Dashboard/Pipeline Profile, Outlook and EOL.  Is there an extra one around for her?  
 
Many thanks, 
<NAME/>
