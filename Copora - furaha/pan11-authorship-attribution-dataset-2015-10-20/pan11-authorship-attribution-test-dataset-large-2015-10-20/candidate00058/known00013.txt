

<NAME/> and Mansoor,

I have received a copy of the as-built drawings for the TW/Agave <NAME/> County Interconnect.  <NAME/>, as I understand it, you have a copy also.  Please confirm that you have what you need.  I will send my copy to Mansoor unless otherwise directed. 

Also, I have received an invoice from Agave for $245,904.20 for their work on this interconnect.  <NAME/>, I believe <NAME/> McConnell faxed you a copy a few weeks ago.  I need you both to approve the invoice so I can pay.  Do either of you have any comments regarding this invoice?  Does anyone else need to see it?  Please advise.

Thanks, <NAME/>.
