

Hi <NAME/> and <NAME/>,

I am not certain that <NAME/> has been made aware of where and which spaces have been allocated to her (<NAME/> Gadd's group) with respect to the move.  In effort to make sure that no one falls through the crack, would you please coordinate with <NAME/> as to which floor and specifically which cubical/office locations she can slot her people in.  <NAME/> will also coordinate <NAME/> Dowd with the rest of <NAME/>'s group in the move so we need to keep a space for him.  

<NAME/>,

Please let me know when you have accounted for everyone in <NAME/>'s group (plus <NAME/> Dowd) for the move and have the location assignment.  


The goal for all is that everyone will have a chair when the music stops.  :>)

Thanks to all for your help!

<NAME/>.
