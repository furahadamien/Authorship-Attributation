

<NAME/>, I currently do not utilize LIM on my desktop, however; in light of the changes with NNG/Dynegy, I believe that someone in my shop should have access to LIM.  We had been currently utilizing <NAME/> Treat and <NAME/> Bolks for LIM information.

Should we coordinate with you?

Please advise.
