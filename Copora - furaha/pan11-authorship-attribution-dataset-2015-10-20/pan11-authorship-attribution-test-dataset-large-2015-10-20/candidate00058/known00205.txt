I just received a message that <NAME/> is going to retire at the end of the month.  I understand that there is a surprise lunch for him in <NAME/> on March 29.  <NAME/> you be attending?  Let us know, we'd like to meet with you if you are going to be in town.  Did you receive the $50 check I sent you for <NAME/>'s gift?  When I was reconciling my checking account a couple of weeks ago, I noticed it had not cleared yet.  I just want to make sure it did not get lost in the mail.

Good luck on Bisti!

Thanks, <NAME/>.
