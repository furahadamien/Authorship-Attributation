We should probably create a message on <NAME/>'s phone that refers callers to someone else - ditto on e:mail messages.  <NAME/>, does it make sense for that referral to be <NAME/>, or you, or <NAME/>?  Others within our organization that may try to reach <NAME/> could have questions about global databases, projects that <NAME/>'s group had been handling, etc.  I am not trying to put this off on you if you don't think it is appropriate - but <NAME/> and/or <NAME/> came to mind as possible contacts.  By copy to <NAME/>, I also wonder if we should review incoming e:mails that have come to <NAME/> over the last several weeks to see if there are some internal requests to which we need to respond.  Let me know what you think.  --<NAME/>
