We shelved it at the time due to IT resource constraints and Philippe's concern over costs.  In the meantime, EES bought a license and uses this system.  I know that <NAME/> was resurrecting this with someone on her team.  She had recently reviewed it with <NAME/> Herod, I believe.  This is one of the items that we listed in Dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for others.  --<NAME/>
