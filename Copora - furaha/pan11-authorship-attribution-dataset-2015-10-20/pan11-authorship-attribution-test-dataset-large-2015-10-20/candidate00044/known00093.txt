But that is the only meeting regarding ENW budgets that has taken place.  I have been working with <NAME/> Castleman (EIM's CAO) since last week to arrange our meeting now set for Monday.  

I think that by "agreed plan", McMahon just means that is the amount that at this point EIM is saying they are willing to take.  --<NAME/>
