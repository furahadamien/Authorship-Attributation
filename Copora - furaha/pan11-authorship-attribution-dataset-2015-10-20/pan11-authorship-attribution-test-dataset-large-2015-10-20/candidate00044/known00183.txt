I have, however, given has resume to <NAME/> Gros who has been leading CommodityLogic and is also paired with <NAME/> Perlman and me on evaluating the potential for commercializing our mid and back office services.  In this effort, it is likely that <NAME/> will to put together a marketing team.  I suggested that he consider <NAME/> for one of those positions.
