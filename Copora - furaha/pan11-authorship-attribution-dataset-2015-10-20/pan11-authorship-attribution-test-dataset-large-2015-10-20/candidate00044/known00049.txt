<NAME/> Buy and I are scheduled to get together tomorrow for an hour.  My intent had been to review operational risk reports and information with him and to suggest an approach for meeting his objectives.  He has added <NAME/>, <NAME/> Brackett, <NAME/> <NAME/> and <NAME/> Port to the tomorrow's meeting since our first point of discussion will be a joint project that <NAME/> and I are sponsoring.  Unless he pairs down the group in tomorrow's meeting after our first topic, I doubt that we will be able to discuss follow up on our conversation in your office regarding operational risk.  --<NAME/>
