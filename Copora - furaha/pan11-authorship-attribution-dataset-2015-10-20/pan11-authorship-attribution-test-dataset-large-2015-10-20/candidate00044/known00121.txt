Although we have missed our commitment to get restated (and fully footing) info back to <NAME/> Leff and <NAME/> Stubblefield today, I think that we need to be able to follow through on this tomorrow.  This is just one of a number of budget meetings that we are having to prepare for as Net Works, and it would be great to get one of these packages finished.   

<NAME/>:  Can <NAME/> get this wrapped up today so that we can finalize all of this tomorrow.  We will just move today's plans -restated pages to you, <NAME/> Apollo,  and <NAME/> by noon and, with your sign off, distribution of revised packet by afternoon - to Thursday.  Thanks.
