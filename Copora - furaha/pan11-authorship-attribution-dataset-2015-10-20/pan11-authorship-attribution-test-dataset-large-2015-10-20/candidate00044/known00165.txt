

The list of proposed Netco employees that <NAME/> Fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for Weather and Crude.  Do you contemplate that Netco would trade those commodities/products?  <NAME/> Hall's team that he has assembled for Netco does not include anyone with either Weather or Crude operations experience.  

We retained two top-notch operations individuals - <NAME/> Hall and <NAME/> Sweeney - who at this time are not on the list for Netco.  Both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations - documentation, risk books and settlements.  <NAME/> and <NAME/> each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details.

<NAME/> has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for Weather.  Prior to has role in EGM, <NAME/> created the MPR and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio.  He also has had extensive experience in gas risk management.   

Sweeney's most recent assignment has been to manage operations for EIM.  The bulk of his <NAME/> experience has been in crude and crude products.  He was part of the original team that opened the Singapore trading office and has experience in the UK as well.  

If you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power, <NAME/> and <NAME/> would both be great players to have on the Netco team.  

Let's discuss.  --<NAME/>
