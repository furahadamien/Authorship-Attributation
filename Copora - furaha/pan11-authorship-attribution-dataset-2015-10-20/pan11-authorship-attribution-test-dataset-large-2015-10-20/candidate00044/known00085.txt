I thought that <NAME/> was a senior director, and realized that his name was not on the list.  I asked <NAME/> to verify his title and to find out if he was in <NAME/> this week so that he could be included.  I didn't understand why he wasn't on the list.  Does he report to you?  <NAME/> that I didn't start a series of events that is wrong.  I thought that he did report to you and that that had been the case for several months.  So I didn't understand why HR's records were not correct.  --<NAME/>
