To clarify, according to <NAME/>, the "protocol" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, <NAME/> envisions simply e:mails or memos between <NAME/> and AEP with regard to any sharing of information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  Operational details to be decided between <NAME/> and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from <NAME/> Ball (<NAME/>) to <NAME/> <NAME/> (AEP).  

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented.  <NAME/> Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with <NAME/>'s treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with <NAME/> Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and <NAME/> Koehler is sending it to <NAME/> Perkins in <NAME/>'s Treasury group for her review.  Upon <NAME/>'s review, <NAME/> will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require actions by <NAME/> will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the <NAME/> and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or memos as suggested by <NAME/> Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update you weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and AEP.  

I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches: 

	1)  <NAME/> and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that <NAME/> has a full 		understanding of operational transition items and their status, or 

	2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you.  

Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week.
