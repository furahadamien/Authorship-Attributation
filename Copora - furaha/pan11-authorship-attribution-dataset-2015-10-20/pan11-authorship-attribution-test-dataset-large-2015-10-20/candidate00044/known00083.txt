

<NAME/> Reeves and I met today with <NAME/> Taylor and <NAME/> Haedicke to discuss the eliminination of confirmations for transacations executed on EnronOnline.  <NAME/> Taylor has been supportive of the elimination of confirmations, and in the meeting today <NAME/> Haedicke agreed.  This elimination of confirmations will have to be reviewed on a counterparty by counterparty basis, and for each counterparty, commodity by commodity.  

Next steps:  Document EOL process and records that can evidence the execution of a transaction (ease of availability, type of 		record available, retention schedule for records, etc. (<NAME/> <NAME/>?)

	       Create a priortized list of counterparties to be approached for elimination of confirmations - large number of 			transactions, those that have asked for paper-relief, etc. (<NAME/> Reeves/<NAME/> Theriot)

	        Set up meeting with <NAME/> Zipper, <NAME/> Webb, <NAME/> Gros, <NAME/> Taylor, <NAME/> Hodge (Legal-Physical Gas), <NAME/> 		Saeger (Legal-Power), and <NAME/> Reeves to review game plan for elimination of confirmations and impact on 		ConfirmLogic (my assistant will set up meeting)
