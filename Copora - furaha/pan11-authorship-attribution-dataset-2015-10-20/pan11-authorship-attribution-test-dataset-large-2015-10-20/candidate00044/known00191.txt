There were 30 or so, plus <NAME/> Piper and <NAME/> Petruska.  I am missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed?  If I am not missing a page, please ask <NAME/> to include the complete list of attendees (all who were at the ASE plus <NAME/> and <NAME/>).  A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees looks funny.  There were many more in attendance.  The cost of the meal makes more sense with a complete list of attendees.  Thanks.
