I can't have everyone go at the same time.  I would like to get the list of dates in 2001 and then send a memo to directors and senior directors requiring them to attend one of the sessions.  Can you also get me a list of the director and senior directors that I have in EIM, EGM and EA?  <NAME/> this course also be offered in London for directors?  --<NAME/>
