

<NAME/>,

This week I pick the Colts!  I'm meeting <NAME/> tonight for dinner, so I'll tell you how that goes.  She made a comment about you yesterday, your name came up and she said "that <NAME/>."  I said "I thought you and <NAME/> were friends."  And she said "Oh that <NAME/>!"  So I figure she's mad at you for, you know the "twins."  Anyway I won't say anything, so don't worry.  We moved the happy hour to next Friday 26th, so you better be there.
Maybe even "Cool <NAME/>."
