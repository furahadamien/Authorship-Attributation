

<NAME/>,

My apologies for the delay in firming up the date of our trip.

Ay you may know, we had an explosion at our Teesside plant in
Northern England. The accident coincided with <NAME/>'s trip to London
and <NAME/> got immersed in all the problems related to it. 

I hope to have a final decision on Monday morning when he comes back 
to <NAME/>.


<NAME/>
