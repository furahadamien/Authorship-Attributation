Are you the right people to discuss payment or modified credit terms for EPMI?  The issue with NEPOOL is that our UI/CMP/NSTAR wholesale reqts deals would be harmed if we don't pay these guys.  
 
I don't know if we should pay, but I need to figure out who is on point for paying if that decision is reached.
 
I know that <NAME/> Llodra is trying to sell these positions.
