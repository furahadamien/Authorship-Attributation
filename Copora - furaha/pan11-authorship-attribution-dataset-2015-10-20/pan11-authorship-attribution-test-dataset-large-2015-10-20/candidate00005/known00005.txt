

It will be difficult to understand the impact of our credit decline on a per transaction basis.  It is probably sufficient to communicate with the Credit department (under <NAME/> <NAME/>) for wholesale and the EWS Services Group (under <NAME/> Hughes) for retail.

I spoke with <NAME/> Hughes and he is going to have CSC run a report of the tariff obligations.  He will send the info to me and I'll forward to Amr <NAME/>.

Thanks.
