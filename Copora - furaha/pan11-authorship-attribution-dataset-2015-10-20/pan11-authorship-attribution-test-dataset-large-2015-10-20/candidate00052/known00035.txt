Thanks for all your work on the NGX issue.  I talked with them today and <NAME/> said all that he need was a Address, ID, and Password to get up and going on their side.  Could you please contact <NAME/>, at your convenience, with this information at (403) 974-4335.

Again, thanks for the quick turnaround.


Regards,

<NAME/>
