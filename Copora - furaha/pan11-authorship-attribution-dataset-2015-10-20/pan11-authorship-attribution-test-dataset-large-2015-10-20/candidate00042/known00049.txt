

<NAME/>,

I've been talking with <NAME/> over the last couple of weeks about possible opportunities at <NAME/>.  Just to give you a quick look at my background, I've been running <NAME/>'s short-term Northwest desk for about 4 years.  Prior to that, I performed more or less the same function with PGE for a couple of years.  My contract with <NAME/> is up July 31.  I'm under a 3-month noncompete obligation after I leave <NAME/>.  Theoretically, my last day with <NAME/> could be May 31, so the first day I'd be able to start somewhere else would be Sept 1.

To be honest, at this point I'm shopping.  My goal is to have 3-4 options to consider by May 31.  I'll be in Salt Lake on May 4, so if you are interested in getting together to talk about any opportunities <NAME/> might have, please let me know.

Thanks,

<NAME/>
