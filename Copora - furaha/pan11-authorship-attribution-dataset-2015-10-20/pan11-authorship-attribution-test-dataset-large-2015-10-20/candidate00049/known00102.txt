

In addition to running the East and West portfolio calculations we will also be running the bankruptcy books on a daily basis.  These should be run as 'Official AdHoc Full Book' but NOT OFFICIALIZED.  

The post id numbers should be e-mailed to <NAME/> Brackett, <NAME/> McGinnis and <NAME/> Powell before you leave for the evening.

Thanks,
