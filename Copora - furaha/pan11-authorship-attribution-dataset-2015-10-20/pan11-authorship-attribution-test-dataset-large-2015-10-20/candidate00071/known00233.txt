

<NAME/> and <NAME/>:

We are working on a time sensitive project and ask that you assist us in determining the names of various <NAME/> entities by doing an historical analysis or whatever means you use.

The entities I need info on are:

<NAME/> Gas Processing Company
<NAME/> Gas Marketing Canada
<NAME/> Oil Canada Ltd.
<NAME/> Oil Corporation

Are these prior names of current <NAME/> entities, are they existing entities, etc.?

Please call me if you need any additional info or if my request is confusing.

Thanks for your help!
