

<NAME/>:
 
We prepared resolutions regarding the opening of brokerage agreements (the ones dated 11/30/2000), which authorized <NAME/> to be a second signatory, however, the problem arose when we tried to get <NAME/> <NAME/> in the Corporate Secretary's office to certify a certificate of incumbency for <NAME/>.  <NAME/> has never officially been elected to the office of Vice President of Risk Assessment and Control, a division of <NAME/> Corp., so as far as the corporate records are concerned, she is not officially a Vice President.  This will be resolved at the <NAME/> Corp. Board Meeting in August and her appointment will be retroactive to November 1, 2000.  Until such time as this has occurred, she cannot be a second signature on our brokerage documents.
