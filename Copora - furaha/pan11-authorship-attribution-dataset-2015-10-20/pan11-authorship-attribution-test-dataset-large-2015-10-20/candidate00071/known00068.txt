

<NAME/> and <NAME/>:

<NAME/> <NAME/> in Financial Settlements faxed me a copy of a Certificate of Amalgamation evidencing the merger of Norske Skog Canada Limited and Pacifica Papers Inc. with Norske Skog Canada Limited being the surviving entity.  You both worked on these files--<NAME/>, Pacifica Papers and <NAME/>, Norske Skog.

Are you all okay with this merger from the credit side?

Thanks!

<NAME/>
