

<NAME/>:

I have been asked by our corporate paralegal to assist him in cleaning up the ENA corporate database as those individuals who have been appointed agent and attorney-in-fact to sign confirmations in connection with financial transactions.  <NAME/> Cook has a copy of an e-mail in the file to <NAME/> Herod setting forth the procedures and telling her that you verify the requests and notify Legal of any changes.  In this e-mail, apparently <NAME/> asked that <NAME/> Moscoso's and <NAME/> Hanson's appointments be revoked and that <NAME/> McClendon be added.

<NAME/> you let me know of any changes that should be made at this time?

Thanks!

<NAME/>
