Officially tired of watching the news.  Actually there is very little new about it.  Channel 12: the local viewpoint.  CNN: the national viewpoint.  CNBC:  the business viewpoint.  ESPN: the sports viewpoint.  <NAME/> Robertson Channel: God's viewpoint.  The politicians all hold news conferences and talk for 15 minutes and say nothing.  "We interrupt the State Dept's news conference to bring you the Justice Dept's news conference where we expect there going to say 'no comment at this time' frequently."  I have a tv on my desk at work that is on constantly just in case something happens, but meanwhile it's driving me nuts.
Just found out another girl I knew is missing. I was supposed to go out with this girl a couple years ago on a blind date but it never went through.  I met her after that.  
So let's talk about something better.  We'll start shallow.  What kind of music do you like?
