I have minor, but substantive, edits to the direct access section that <NAME/> did, which I believe more accurately capture the document that we previously delivered to Hertzberg and the discussions around that document.  My proposed edits will be distributed to everyone within the next 30-60 minutes.  Thanks to <NAME/> for all the work.

Best,
<NAME/>
