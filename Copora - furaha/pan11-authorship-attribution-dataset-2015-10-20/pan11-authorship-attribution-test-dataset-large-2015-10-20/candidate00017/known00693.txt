You involved at all with the gas infrastructure stuff that's going on at the Cal PUC.  If not, I think that you should be.  Now that Fawcett has left TW and <NAME/> <NAME/>'s in our shop in <NAME/> with <NAME/>, I'm a little concerned about TW (I don't have as much time to monitor anymore).  Be great if you got involved.

<NAME/> all is well with you and yours.

Best,
<NAME/>
