For what it's worth, I agreed with <NAME/> that to the extent <NAME/> and <NAME/> had reached agreement regarding, among other things, <NAME/>'s use of the corporate aircraft for non-EES purposes, that it may not make sense to have EES bear those costs.  But it was clear in my conversation with <NAME/> that it was not my call to make.
