He is running for Texas Land Commissioner.  <NAME/> said yesterday that we have given him a significant amount of money and that <NAME/> has made a personal contribution.  Eliz - please tell me what we have given -- PAC and corporate, if any.  <NAME/> - could you tell me of <NAME/>'s personal contribution?
