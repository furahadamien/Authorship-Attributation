

We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:

<NAME/> Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
<NAME/> <NAME/> for East Power
<NAME/> Storey for Gas 
<NAME/> Luce for Peoples and Global Net
<NAME/> Gaskill for Gas Fundys
<NAME/> Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
<NAME/> Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.

Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from <NAME/> who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.

I am assuming its zero at the moment.
