

I would like more detail about how much margin my open positions require and how the muni's are treated with regard to margin.  The call's I am short are way out of the money.  The only positions that are changing very much in value are the <NAME/> shares I am long and the <NAME/> puts I am short.  I would consider closing those positions.  I would like to put the maximum possible into Muni's.

Please forward this email to <NAME/>.
