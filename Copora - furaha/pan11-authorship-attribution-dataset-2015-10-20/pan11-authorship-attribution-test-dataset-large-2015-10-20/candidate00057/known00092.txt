

<NAME/>, 
	based on your schedule, how does Tues March 26 in the morning look for you to review the maintenance records for the Gomez lateral with <NAME/> Allard from Pioneer?  How long do you think it will take, including a drive following the lateral route?

I would plan to fly out to Midland from <NAME/> that Monday night, and be at the office for the meeting on Tuesday morning.  

Let me know as soon as you can please.

thanks
<NAME/> Hyatt
