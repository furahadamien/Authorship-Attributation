They apparently realized this last fall and started to panic.  Buffet boys come in and pick off one of the crown jewels at a pretty sweet price (including the KRGT expansion).  The sale not only helps WPL's current finances but eliminates the need to spend $1.2bn on the expansion.  What's interesting is the preferred shares also established in the deal.  <NAME/> could end up owning a big chunk of WPL when it's over.
