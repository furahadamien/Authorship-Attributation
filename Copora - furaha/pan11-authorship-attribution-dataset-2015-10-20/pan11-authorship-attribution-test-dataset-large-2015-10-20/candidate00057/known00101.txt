	thanks for your phone call this morning.  In light of our conversation, I have prepared the attached document, with help from our VP of Finance <NAME/> <NAME/>, in order to help APS better understand the current and projected Transwestern credit situation.  

After you and <NAME/> Carlson have had a chance to review, please feel free to contact us with any questions.
