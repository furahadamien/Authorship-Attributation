	Mr. <NAME/> Wilkes from General Electric Power Systems has agreed to present for NGI Session C on 3/20.  He will cover two topics including "Changing gas quality specs and their impact to turbines" and "Pressure Reliability".  He is preparing his initial draft which should be available in the next two weeks.

Please forward to him a conference invitation at your earliest convenience.  Contact info is as follows:

Mr. <NAME/> Wilkes
                                                                                                                

Also, when you, me and <NAME/> met at the P.O. DoubleTree, <NAME/> mentioned an article he saw dealing with LNG gas specs and their impact to gen units.  He was going to try and get me a copy of the article and check into whether or not the author would want to present at the conference (at least that's my recollection).  Can you follow up with <NAME/> to see if he's had any success?

thanks
