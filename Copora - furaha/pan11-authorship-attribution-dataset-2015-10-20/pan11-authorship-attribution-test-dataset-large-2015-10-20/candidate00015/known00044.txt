Thank you very much for the info.  I have forwarded the specs on to <NAME/> Leach who will be responsible for ordering the fuel oil.  I asked him to identify any spec parameters that are not readily attainable with commercially available #2 Fuel Oil.  For example, I'm fairly certain that 0.0% ash is not normally available.  I have also asked him  to provide information on what grades of fuel oil are available that we should consider.   I will forward any feedback that I receive from <NAME/> to you so we can then have the team determine how best to proceed from that point.

Thanks again for all your help.
