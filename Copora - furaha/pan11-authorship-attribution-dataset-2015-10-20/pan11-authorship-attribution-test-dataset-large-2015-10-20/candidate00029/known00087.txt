

<NAME/>:

I just received a phone call from Bear Stearns inquiring about an <NAME/> Corp. guaranty for the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. brokerage account.

Have you received approval from credit?  If so, what is the amount of the guaranty? 
 
Are we keeping the <NAME/> Credit Inc. brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. account?  If so, are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the <NAME/> Credit Inc. account which was amended to provide for a $100,000,000 cap?

Please advise me and credit of the status.

Thanks.

<NAME/>
