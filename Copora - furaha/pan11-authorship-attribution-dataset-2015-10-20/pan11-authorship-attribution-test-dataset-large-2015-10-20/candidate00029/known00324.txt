

Of these positions, where the counterparty has not terminated, and there is only FX/rate activity, I find only:

Goldman Sachs & Co.

<NAME/> and <NAME/> are reviewing this one - it may be repo activity.

I am still trying to clarify what we can be doing for in-the-money terminated positions.

We can discuss further at 2:30.
