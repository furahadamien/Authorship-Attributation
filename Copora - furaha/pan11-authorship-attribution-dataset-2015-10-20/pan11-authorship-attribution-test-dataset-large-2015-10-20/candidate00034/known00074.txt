

Good Afternoon Sweeite,

I have my new driver's license and my divorce papers to change my name over to just plain <NAME/> Freeland.

Do I send them to you or what do I do?


also-

Have you heard if parking or Tri-met will be subsidized at all in the New World Order?


Lemmie Know,


<NAME/> Freeland
