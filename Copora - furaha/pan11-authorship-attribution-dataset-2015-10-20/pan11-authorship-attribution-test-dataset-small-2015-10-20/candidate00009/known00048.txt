When you come to our house for Xmas try to be here by Saturday afternoon.  The party that <NAME/> and <NAME/> usually have may be at our house since they are in the middle of building their house.  They are driving to Florida after xmas and want to stop and see you either on the way or on the way back.  I gave the Dad's 1-800 number.
