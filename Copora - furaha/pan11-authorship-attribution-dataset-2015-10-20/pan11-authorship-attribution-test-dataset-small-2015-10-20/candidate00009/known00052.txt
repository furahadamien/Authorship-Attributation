In all cases except for Hallwood, ENA <NAME/> has a relationship with these customers that primarily covers their physical business, we would like to expand that business to cover their Derivative business as well.  The list is based on priority.  We would be willing to cover them for their West Gas business only.  <NAME/> could continue to cover their East, Central and Oil/Liquids business.
