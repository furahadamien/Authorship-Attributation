

I will be out the 19th but should be in the 20th.  <NAME/> Felling should be your contact on the 19th.  She is most familiar with our computer systems.

The <NAME/> North America offices are at 1200 17th St. Suite 2750 in Downtown <NAME/>.
The office is over 9,000 Square Feet but is currently under construction in order to sublease approximately half of that space.
We currently have 6 employees.
I believe that you have copied all of the <NAME/> offices that I know of.

The only other potential office is EOTT.

Let me know if you need anything else.
