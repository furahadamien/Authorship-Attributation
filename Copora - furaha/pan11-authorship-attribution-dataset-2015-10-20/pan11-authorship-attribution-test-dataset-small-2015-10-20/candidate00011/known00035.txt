

We have not scheduled this load as of yet.   I met with Narasimha yesterday in order to cut through the b.s. and get at least a rudimentary plan in place.
Here it is:
	By 7am - EES submits to us their  load plan / hedges - EES to use their forecast initially.
	We cover open position and submit schedules to Ercot
	We monitor Real Time and handle continigencies
	Wholesale settlement provided,   ancillary service charges , local congestion,  etc is to be passed to EES.

Narasimha will provide the load info and we are projecting a September 1st start  at the latest.    

We are preparing a term sheet today that will reflect the basic requirements above.    We will certainly add more complexity to this deal in the form of fixing exposure to A/S and other charges.   
We are prepared to go forward with this immediately.
