

Congrats to you and your wife on your new arrival.     <NAME/> she's a good sleeper.      Now at least you can field some different questions,  "how is the baby?"   versus "where is the baby?"
But,  as <NAME/> used to say,  "enough about you,   let's talk about me."   I spoke with <NAME/> B again and he is agreeable to the idea of my return.    He mentioned that West has needs in Services,  Middle Mkt - SW and even Structuring.    I think that I would be a good fit in Mid Mkt,  as I could build upon my experience  and also learn as much of the structuring side as  possible.     Wherever I go,  I am ready to make an impact.

 The HR department here in <NAME/> wants me to entertain other opportunities within <NAME/> and they have brought some things before me today.    I had also considered staying and building the Ercot business here,  as there is a huge need for leadership in this area.    However,   Real Time roles are very hard to shed around here and I am apprehensive about being a Commercial Director managing Real Time.   I have no doubt that I could make a huge difference here,  but a lot of time would have to be wasted defending the group and myself.   

Anyway,  I wish we could sit down, have a beer and discuss,  but that's probably not practical.     Belden says to talk with you about the needs of the floor and get some idea where the ideal fit might be.      

 I know that you are out of the office,  but give me an e-mail when you get a chance.

Thanks,
<NAME/>
