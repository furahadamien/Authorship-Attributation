I relayed that I did talk to <NAME/> Adams last night and he did agree to give us one hour notice with an OOME instruction.    This is great,  however,   <NAME/> warned me that we were outside of the tariff because Ercot still maintains that OOMC means run.
He relayed that in the event of line meltdown,  etc.  we would be liable.     <NAME/> Adams also said this last night.   We are officially on notice of potential QSE liability.

In my opinion we need to:
Call <NAME/> Saathoff and see if he can resolve their confusion today, otherwise we need to file whatever is necessary, under the protocols,  to protest this ridiculous interpretation and to protect ourself from this "liability."
Officially request clarification in the protocols on this issue.

Thanks,
<NAME/>
