What is the status of <NAME/>?   I think that you have been speaking with <NAME/> <NAME/> concerning bringing him over from EES.   <NAME/> is inquiring about his status and wants to know whether he should mention anything to EES.    I would think not, at this time.
<NAME/> is out of town until Monday,  so I am trying to follow up on his behalf.


Thanks,
<NAME/>
