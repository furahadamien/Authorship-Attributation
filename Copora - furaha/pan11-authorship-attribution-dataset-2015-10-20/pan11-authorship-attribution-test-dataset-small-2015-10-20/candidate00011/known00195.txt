My name is <NAME/> Forney and I am the new Electricity  Cash trader in the Entergy region,  reporting to <NAME/> Presto.         I received a letter agreement from Entergy that seeks to clarify the Entergy  "Into"  definition.   <NAME/> Herndon has relayed that we have tried to get them to transact under an EEI agreement,  where they have been willing to only operate under WSPP.    They are trying to get us to agree to use the WSPP contract with EEI  liquidated damages language.
I need to meet with you on this issue.   <NAME/> is available to anwer questions on the background of this ,   if necessary.


Thanks,
