I spoke with <NAME/> directly about <NAME/>'s e-mail and concerns.    <NAME/> said that <NAME/> of C.O.B contacted him,  inquiring about job opportunities here.     <NAME/> did mention to <NAME/> that "someone" from their shop had already inquired.   He was not specific.    <NAME/>,  evidently,  figured who this was (not very hard)  and spread the word at the COB office.   Subsequently,   <NAME/> and <NAME/> sent their resumes.

I have spoken directly with <NAME/> about this issue.  I also have put out a note to the group which I copied you on.    Clearly,  this is unacceptable and <NAME/> has apologized.

How do you feel about this:   
if we hire <NAME/>,  then this problem somewhat goes away.    I need someone immediately and <NAME/> could be plugged right in,  similar to Alex.     I know that <NAME/> may not be a solid fit for the trader track program,  but I am needing some help pretty quick.

Let me know - sorry for the very awkward  situation.

<NAME/>
