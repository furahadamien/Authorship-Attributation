<NAME/>, 

A couple of weeks ago I asked you to review the City of Las Cruces and let me know if we have an enfolio or if we have sent them a draft.  Could you let me know where we stand with that?  I need to respond to them by Monday, the 8th.

thanks,

<NAME/>

PS  Also, I know you sent <NAME/> a request for an Enfolio for IID but I never received a copy.  Did you?
