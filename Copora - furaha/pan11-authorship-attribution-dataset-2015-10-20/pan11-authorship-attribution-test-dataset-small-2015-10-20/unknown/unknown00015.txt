Spoke to <NAME/> at the lawyer's office today.  Everything has been signed by <NAME/> and <NAME/> will mail me the originals to sign.  I asked about a termination ont he $1500.00, Joal told <NAME/> that since we couldn't include it in this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting with <NAME/>.  IF <NAME/> agrees, they will prepare and addendum to the original agreement.   I've learned a lot and the sooner we are through with this lawyer the happier I will be.  BE NICE NOW.
