<NAME/>:

A rumor is going around that <NAME/> Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:
	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an <NAME/> entity.
	2)  If such a clause does exist what is <NAME/>'s intent as far as payment or litigation?
	3)  What other <NAME/> employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?

Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!

	Thanks, <NAME/>
