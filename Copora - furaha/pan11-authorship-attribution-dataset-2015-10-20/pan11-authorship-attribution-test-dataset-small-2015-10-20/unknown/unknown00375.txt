HEY WOMAN!!!!   What the heck are you doing?

I did make it back.  I actually came in most of last week.  I just get way to bored at home in my tiny little apartment.  I have this strong urge to go out and spend  money and that's just the wrong thing to do right now.

We don't really know much about the New Company right now.  I'm actually on the estate team anyway.  I sit on 5 with <NAME/> Concannon, <NAME/> Pollen, Robin Barbe, and <NAME/> Kelly.  The rumor 2 weeks ago was that UBS was going to cut 25% of the jobs if they won.  I think <NAME/> said that we should know alot more by tomorrow.  I think I know of a couple of people that have left; <NAME/> Jones (black guy in origination - real nice guy too) starts working for TXU in Dallas today, <NAME/> Farmer (Texas Desk)  is going to AEP.
