I sold 3,253 dth per day of  Florida Zone 3 gas at $3.60 to <NAME/> Crites (713-420-2499) at El Paso effective 4/3/02 - 4/30/02.  I'm leaving this deal out of Sitara because its an <NAME/> Compressor Services deal, not ENA.

<NAME/>, I need to send a GISB agreement as <NAME/> Compressor Services to El Paso.  Would you work on that?

<NAME/>, I'm not sure who at <NAME/> to notify about this deal.  You and I can chat about that later.

I only asked for 2 bids for the April gas.  Reliant showed me a bid of $3.58 and El Paso shoed me a bid of $3.60.
