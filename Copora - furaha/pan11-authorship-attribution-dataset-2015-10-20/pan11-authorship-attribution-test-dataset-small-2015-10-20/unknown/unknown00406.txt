~Beauty of a Woman~  
The beauty  of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, 
The  figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair. 
The  beauty of a woman must be seen from her eyes, 
Because that  is the doorway to her heart, 
The place where love resides.  
The beauty of a woman Is not in a facial mole,  
But true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul.  
It is the caring that she lovingly gives,  
The passion that she shows. 
The beauty  of a woman 
With passing years -- only  grows.
