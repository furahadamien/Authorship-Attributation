Kysa,
This is totally inappropriate and HIGHLY unprofessional. In these difficult times we need to continue to put forth and display <NAME/>'s core values: Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence. I look for this in each one of my coworkers and for every member of the real-time team. Please see what you can do to better respect <NAME/>'s feelings and the effort she puts in each day.
