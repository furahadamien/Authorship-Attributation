<NAME/>,
I called earlier today and left a lengthy phone message........sorry about that - we had a trading issue in the middle of my conversation with you.

Anyway,  I received the following question from some of our Retail folks. 
If you could help answer this question I would really appreciate it.
<NAME/> Miller and I are planning to visit <NAME/> next Friday to discuss Settlements.   We look forward to meeting you.
Are you a golfer?   We may try to play Friday afternoon.
