Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related to HPL.  <NAME/> did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda rough this time.  In addition to <NAME/> leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  It's a little harder to get things done.

Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see <NAME/> go down.  We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach.  <NAME/> is doing his best to either run <NAME/> off or make him tough.  <NAME/> runs over <NAME/> with his toys, pushes <NAME/> out the way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect <NAME/>, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going.

Anyway, I need to get back to work.  <NAME/> the family is doing well.  Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next couple of days.
