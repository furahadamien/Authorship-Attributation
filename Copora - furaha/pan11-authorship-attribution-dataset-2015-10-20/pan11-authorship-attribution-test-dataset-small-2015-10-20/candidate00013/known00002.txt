

On Feb 7, we sold 10,000 to <NAME/> Energy Field Services at Waha.  However, I entered the deal (#603484) under <NAME/> Energy Marketing (Can you believe I made a mistake?).  To correct this, I created a new ticket (#700132) under DEFS.  

<NAME/> - Please repath these deals and let <NAME/> know when you're done.

Sorry for the extra work.
