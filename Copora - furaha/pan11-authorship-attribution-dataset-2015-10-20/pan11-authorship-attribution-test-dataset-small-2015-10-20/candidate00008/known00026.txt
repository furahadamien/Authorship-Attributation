

When we slow Gallup down or take it down to avoid the electric peaks, please log it.  This will help the field to keep 
track of the days and give <NAME/> Jolly and <NAME/> Roensch (Tiny) the information they may need to answer questions.
Your help in this matter will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks DS
