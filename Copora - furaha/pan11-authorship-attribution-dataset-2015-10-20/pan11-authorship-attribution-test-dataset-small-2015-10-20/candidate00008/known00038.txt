the volumes we can't do it.
The gas prices so far for Oct. look higher going to Cal. border.  We will have to see if we have the volumes next week to 
run the pigs.  Sure would have been nice to have run pigs this week everyone could see that flows were up and we should
have taken advantage of this.  Again, we will take a look at all scenario's next week.  

Thanks DS
