                                   are still one 8" orfice run dedicated to flow gas back to TW.  They apologize for the confussion.
Burlington Jackrabbit-- <NAME/> with Burlington called and the point does no longer exist on their side and will not ever be using it.
                                  Does this mean we can inactivate it on TW?
