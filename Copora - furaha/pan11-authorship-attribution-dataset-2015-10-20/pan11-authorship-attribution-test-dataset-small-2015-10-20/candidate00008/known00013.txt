

Spoke to <NAME/> Blair, <NAME/> Watson, <NAME/> Rivers, <NAME/> <NAME/>, and Terry Kowalke, we would like to hold the same 
scheduled numbers on ID/2 from San <NAME/> Lateral as we had scheduled for ID/1 from San <NAME/> Lateral.  
We think this will help us minimize our Operator and Shipper imbalances.  
Please let us know if we start getting complaints from our customers.  
If anyone has other ideas or comments please let us know.

Example:

Non-Grid--    San <NAME/> Scheduled      870,000
ID/1                                                                875,000
ID/2                                                                875,000 
(we will have to do the right mouse click and update the capacity to the flow rate needed.)
