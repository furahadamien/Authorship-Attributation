the pigs.  It was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams
possibly coming from the Bitter Lakes and Red Bluff points.  I had them pull moisture readings and they
were well below TW's  #7 of water.  They said it was more like drip.  This heavies are in the gas stream
that is falling out and collecting in the pipe.  I agree that we need to run pigs when we have the volumes.
We in gas control will continue to work with the field to make that happen.
If I have the wrong impression on what is happening I apologize.  Please let me know.

Thanks DS
