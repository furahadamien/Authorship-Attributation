 Here is the redline version including FM revisions.  We cannot agree to the sentence in section 14.4 beginning "In addition....." as we will not pay demand charges. 
Also with regard to days to cure default, sections 9.4 /  10.3 as discussed.  We would agree to 4 days? Please review the attached and let me have your thoughts.
