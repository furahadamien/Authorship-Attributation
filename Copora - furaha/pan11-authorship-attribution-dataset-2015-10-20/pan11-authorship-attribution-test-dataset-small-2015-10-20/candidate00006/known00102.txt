

The confirmation for the July -Oct transaction with Kenoil has not been signed.   Mr. Flecher does not think he needs to sign this?  Are we purchasing gas? I will resend the confirm to him for signature unless you tell me otherwise.

Also, please remember to advise regarding volumes for the last agreements you sent.
