

<NAME/> & <NAME/> - I have sold my house and will be moving to an apt. near Kirby & W. Alabama before the end of the month.  I  am in the process of packing up my house and have several other obligations this weekend so I will not be able to arrange for the newsletter distribution.  I believe I gave <NAME/> a list of the distributors - <NAME/> will not be able to continue and <NAME/> and <NAME/> have indicated they would like some relief also.  On the positive side, <NAME/>(?) in the 300 block of Welch (with the new baby) has said she would like to help.  

I can't remember the new officers so could you all arrange for a transition to a new distributor?  

Thanks,

<NAME/>
