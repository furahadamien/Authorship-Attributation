

<NAME/>,

Attached is a draft of <NAME/>'s response to your request for proposals for gas supply to power generation plant in development by Calpeak Power, LLC.  As requested, <NAME/> has provided indexed pricing with the option to convert to various fixed priced products during the term of the agreement.

The options presented are not intended to represent a complete list of opportunities, but are representative of the different pricing structures <NAME/> offers.  There are several additional structures available  and we look forward to discussing these options with you.

Please call me with any questions you might have regarding the proposal.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,
