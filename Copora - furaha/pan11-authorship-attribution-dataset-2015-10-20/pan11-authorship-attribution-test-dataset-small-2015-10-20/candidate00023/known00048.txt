Oh, never mind that's just <NAME/> stock price!
It is probably crazy but I'm buying some more here!
Good thing that with Equity that you can not lose more than your investment!

<NAME/> lost his last baseball game last night 6-11.
It was not so much they got beat as they gave it away.
They were ahead by 2 going into the last inning and had 9 runs score on 11 errors.
I think we figured the other team had something like 9 outs that inning.

<NAME/> and I are going to LSU this weekend.
<NAME/> is staying with <NAME/> since he has an end of season baseball party on Sunday.
The party is at 2:00 and we are scheduled to get into Hobby at 1:10 so I hope to make it to the party.

Be Safe and may the FORCE be with you!
