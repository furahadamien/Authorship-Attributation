

<NAME/>,

Our primary delivery point on the EP capacity is the border so it would have to flow as an alternative delivery location and would be subject to cuts.  I would like to talk to you in more detail about this with the assistance of <NAME/> Miller who is the tport expert in our group.  Then you can decide how you would like to persue.  <NAME/> will be available in the morning before 11:00 am CDT.

Please give me a call when you can -

Thanks,

<NAME/>
