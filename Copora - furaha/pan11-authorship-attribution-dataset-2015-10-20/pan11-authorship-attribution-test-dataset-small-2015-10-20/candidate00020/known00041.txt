I talked to <NAME/> <NAME/> yesterday and exchanged emails with <NAME/> - looks like they are thinking of a girls weekend in Chicago Oct. 26 -28.  If <NAME/> didn't ask you for your address before, she needs it - as do I.  How does that look for you?  I can get a ticket right now for $188.  

I do wish you would come down here with <NAME/> sometime.  Of course I would want to have you for part of the time you were here!  <NAME/> could come too - we could go to dinner or I could have a bar-b-que or something!

Yes - I am still hanging out with <NAME/>.  Things are good. He is very nice and lots of fun! 

Keep me posted on the girls weekend and I hope things are going well for you!

Love, <NAME/>
