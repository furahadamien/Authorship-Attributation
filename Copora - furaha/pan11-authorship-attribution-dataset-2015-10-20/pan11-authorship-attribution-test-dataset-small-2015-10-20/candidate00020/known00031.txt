Nothing new - stayed in town this weekend and had a fun relaxing time.  <NAME/> just called and wanted to know if I was going to COGA.  I had to break the bad news!  When <NAME/> and her current boyfriend break up - (gerald met him too) I will let you know!

So what is going on the weekend <NAME/> is making us go up to <NAME/>?  Should I come in on Sat - since I can't go to NYC for the US open!!
