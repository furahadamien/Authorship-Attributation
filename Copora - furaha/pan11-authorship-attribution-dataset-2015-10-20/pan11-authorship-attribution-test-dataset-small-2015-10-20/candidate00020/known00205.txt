

<NAME/>,

Palo Alto is telling me that they need <NAME/> signatures on all of the confirms that we sent them last week.  If you could print out copies and have them sent to me, I can get <NAME/> to sign them and overnight them to Palo.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

<NAME/>
