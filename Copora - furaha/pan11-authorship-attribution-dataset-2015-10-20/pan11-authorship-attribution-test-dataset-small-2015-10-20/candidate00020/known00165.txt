Just think - with your awesome new car next year - you could be up there with <NAME/> and that other guy!  I could grab dinner or something later - when are you planning to go to <NAME/>'s?  I have nothing going on - may try to get a quick workout in.  You can just let me know what you want to do.

K.

ps.  I told <NAME/> that I got to drive the race car and it was really cool!
