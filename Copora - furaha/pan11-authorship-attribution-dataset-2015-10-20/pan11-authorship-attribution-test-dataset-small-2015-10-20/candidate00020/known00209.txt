We just went to Berryhill and had a taco and margarita.  Not a late night.  You didn't have to leave - I am glad you came though.  <NAME/> we can do it again sometime - once I get over this hump.  (See, I am still insecure and a disaster when it comes to relationships! and I hadn't even gone there in 5 years!)

Take care and keep in touch.
