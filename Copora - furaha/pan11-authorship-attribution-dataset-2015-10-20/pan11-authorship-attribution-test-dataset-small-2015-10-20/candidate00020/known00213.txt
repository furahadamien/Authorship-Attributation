

<NAME/>,

I got a phone call from Summit energy, through whom I supply full requirements gas to Smurfit <NAME/> Container Corporations plants in southern California.  Smurfit has a couple of plants in El Paso, Texas, on the Southern Union System, that Summit is looking to obtian bids for.  The contact at Summit is <NAME/> <NAME/> and his number is 502-429-3800.  Their load is about 100,000 MMBtu annually.  Is there someone at EES that would be interested in working on this transaction?  Let me know if EES is not interested and I will let <NAME/> know.

Thanks,

<NAME/> <NAME/>
