Once again, so sorry about <NAME/>'s inability to transact on the deal this morning because of contract issues.

We need to fix the issue, so that it does not occur again, so.....attached is a copy of the agreement that we need you to review and execute.  I believe <NAME/> may have worked on this back in March, and I wasn't sure if you all ever received a copy, but if you didn't here it is.

Please call if you have further questions.

<NAME/>
