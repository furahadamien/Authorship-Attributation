<NAME/> Monahan of CSN asked me to forward the attached gas purchase contract to you for review.  We are currently scheduled to deliver natural gas volumes to CSN's Terre Haute facility for November 1st activity.  As a consequence, we would like to have your comments or approval as soon as possible.

My telephone number is 713-853-5772 should you have any questions.

Sorry for the rush!

Thank you

<NAME/> Thurston
