For the Texas Desk, <NAME/> Olsen and I will start out handling the scheduling activities.  As we start up we will not be doing a lot of shipping on the intrastate pipes.  We will primarily be utilizing hub and cartwheel agreements and net outs.  Trading primarily on the Waha, <NAME/> , and Carthage hubs.  I will cover <NAME/> and Carthage.  <NAME/> will continue to cover Waha and any shipping activities on the intrastate pipes.  I will need a second person fairly soon after we begin trading again (within a month or two).  

What are you thinking that we need to look into on the intrastates?

Also, with message of setting up new budgets, can you have <NAME/> send me a copy of the budget we had in place for Texas 2002? 

Thanks.
