

<NAME/>....How was the weekend??????  Very curious to see what you crazy girls did up there in Whistler.  

So, I wanted to let you know that Puget called me last Friday with another job opening.  I'm supposed to talk to the guy today regarding the position.  I certainly don't want to get my hopes up...but I'm kind of excited about this being something I could actually like.  

<NAME/> all is well with you and I'll let you know how my phone call goes today.

Talk to you soon,
<NAME/>

Btw...messengered with <NAME/> yesterday, I guess things are back to "normal" - whatever that is.
