I get into London on the 6th of June and fly out on the 12th.  Please let me know if you're going to be in town during that time.  I really want to try and get together while I'm there.  I may be going elsewhere the 6th thru the 9th (my friend, <NAME/>, wants to take a little trip somewhere) but I will definitely be in town Saturday night through Monday...let me know.

I was very excited to hear about Caycie too.
