How's married life treating you these days?  I hope things are good with your job, home, etc.  

I was actually writing you to try and get <NAME/>'s email address.  My friend <NAME/> and I are going to Seattle next week for a long weekend and I was hoping to get some tips from her as well as possibly get together for lunch or dinner.

<NAME/> to see you soon and please say, "Hi!" to everyone for me next weekend at the lake house.  I'm so sad I'll be missing it, but I'd already booked my flight by the time <NAME/> sent the email.

Love,
<NAME/>
