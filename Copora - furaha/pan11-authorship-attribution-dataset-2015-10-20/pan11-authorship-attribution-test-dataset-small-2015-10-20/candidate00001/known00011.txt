Received your email but I don't have any particular knowledge in this area.  I would assume but without any knowledge that an English judgment would be enforceable in the US ( I would assume that we give English law  guarantees all the time for ISDA and other trading contracts which would have to be enforced against <NAME/> in the US)  Maybe <NAME/> <NAME/> in London or <NAME/> Abrams (<NAME/> corp attorney who works on guarantees ) would be able to help.  Good luck.
