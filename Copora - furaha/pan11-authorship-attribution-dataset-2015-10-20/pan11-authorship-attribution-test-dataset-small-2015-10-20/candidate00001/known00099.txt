Looks like there is alot of work needed on <NAME/>'s draft. I'm working this weekend and hopefully we all can meet on Monday.  Meanwhile can you get from <NAME/> anything in writing that we used in connection with opposing the Bingham bill.  Those arguments would be very helpful to maybe repeat in the FERC response
