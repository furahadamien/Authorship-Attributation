 I would not be able to make the meetings during the week of July 23rd but <NAME/> could on the collateral annex. The WSPP is holding its meeting on August 10th so that also may not be the best time for people, but again <NAME/> could likely attend the collateral annex meeting.  <NAME/> all is well. And as always thanks for your help.
