<NAME/>,
Please try to send or copy any emails to me at <NAME/> III, <NAME/>. NOT <NAME/>, <NAME/>. This email went to <NAME/> <NAME/> with <NAME/> who happen to be in Sweden...
 
<NAME/> Symes will be taking care of your spreadsheet when she has an opportunity. As you may be aware we have recently brought out EnronOnLine to the hourly market. We have seen a dramatic increase in volumes, and priorities have shifted as a result. Daily deadlines must be met. We are working on our deal entry accuracy. I appreciate your patience, we will attend to this issue shortly.
