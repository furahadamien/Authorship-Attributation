Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
you'll be in the doghouse big time!
Germany, <NAME/> says:

Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:

Germany, <NAME/> says:

Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
yes
Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
he was very controlling and demanding
Germany, <NAME/> says:
most of us guys are
Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
and he didn't like alexa
Germany, <NAME/> says:
I'm sorry.
Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
did you ever get married?
Germany, <NAME/> says:
nope, i gave her a ring but we are going to wait and see how things work out after the baby comes.  statistics show that that method doesn't lead to sucessful marriages very often
Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
that's probably a good idea....you can probably relate to why i didn't marry brian now right!?
Germany, <NAME/> says:
but we will see.
Germany, <NAME/> says:
yeah but its a litte different.  i still think its pretty much my fault - what you and i went through and what <NAME/> and I are going through.  In you situation i could see where brian was a major problem
Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
i knew i didn't love him and i knew that that would not make a loving envirnoment to raise a child.
Germany, <NAME/> says:
yep, that's what we are gong thru.
Germany, <NAME/> says:
so are you going to stay way up North?
Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
well, just know that if you ever need someone to talk to just let me know.
Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
i'm staying there for now, going to hang out and see what happens here, then come 2/03, i can start looking for a job & not limited to just looking in houston any more
Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
don't really want to go anywhere else right now but who know's what life will bring!
Germany, <NAME/> says:
yep, may be time to consider richmond. VA
Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
it snows there!!!  i don't think i could handle that (or i don't want to have to handle it!)
Germany, <NAME/> says:
that's true - guess you've had your fill of snow.
Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
i just can't handle the cold after being down here so long!
Germany, <NAME/> says:
hey, maybe you could go to FPL in florida?  close to disney and beaches
Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
with my retention (assuming we get the $$$!) i might pay off bills and then get a job as a greeter at the wal-mart in conroe!
Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
are you in the retention pool?
Germany, <NAME/> says:
Wooohooo, you must have a good retention.
Germany, <NAME/> says:
i'm in the lipp pool, i think that's what they call it.
Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
do you think we'll see the $$$?
Germany, <NAME/> says:
You will for sure, don't know about mine though.
Germany, <NAME/> says:
mine gets real nice if we collect $3Bill, don't know if we are going to collect that.
Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
the lipp pool sounds a whole lot more 'vague'
Germany, <NAME/> says:
yeah, i'm off to lunch chat with you later
Driscoll-<NAME/>, Marde L. says:
chow
Germany, <NAME/> says:
