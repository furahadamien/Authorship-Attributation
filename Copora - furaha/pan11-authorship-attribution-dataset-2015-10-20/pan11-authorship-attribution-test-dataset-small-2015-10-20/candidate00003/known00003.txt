

<NAME/> Jenkins gave me your name as an <NAME/> contact regarding Enovate.

I work for <NAME/> McMichael on the gas side of the <NAME/> Estate team.  <NAME/> <NAME/> schedules gas for the <NAME/> Estate Team.  <NAME/> received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system <NAME/> uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  <NAME/> Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not <NAME/>.  <NAME/> was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate <NAME/>'s access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?
