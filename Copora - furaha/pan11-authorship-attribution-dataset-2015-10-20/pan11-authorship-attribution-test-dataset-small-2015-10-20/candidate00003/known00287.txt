<NAME/>, Drew, I am requesting the payment to be made on Monday, June 17th.  I will get the wire request from settlements, attach the supporting documents, get <NAME/>'s signature, and leave it with <NAME/>.  I assume <NAME/> will pass it on to one of you after she approves it.  Is that how the process works these days?
