

I'm working on my contact list.  It looks like I'll have better luck after lunch.  FP&L asked me to call back after lunch.  <NAME/> said that <NAME/> <NAME/> just doesn't want to talk about it till after trading.

Interesting note (and I'm keeping track of my notes)  AEP will not buy gas from <NAME/>.  I spoke to <NAME/> Villarreal (works for <NAME/> Pipeline).  She called <NAME/> Lambert in her <NAME/> office and <NAME/> told <NAME/> that AEP will not buy gas from <NAME/>.

I'll keep you guys posted on my Bridgeline notes through out the day.
