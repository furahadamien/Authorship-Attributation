

Reliant has agreed to sell us gas on Florida.  My trading contact is <NAME/> Taylor (713-207-1482).  The contact on the wire should be <NAME/> Torres (713-207-1471), he is in Reliant's credit department.  <NAME/> said there should be an active GISB contract with Reliant already in place.  I would like to prepay for 5 days and I have my calculation on the prepay request form. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.
