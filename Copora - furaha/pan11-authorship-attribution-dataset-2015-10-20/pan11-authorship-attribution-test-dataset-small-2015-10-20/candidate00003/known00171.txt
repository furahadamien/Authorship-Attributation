I will be out tomorrow and <NAME/> Sanchez (713-345-7791) will be backing me up.

<NAME/>, tomorrow morning, call <NAME/> Taylor (713-207-1482) by 9:00 AM and let him know if we are taking the gas or not.  If <NAME/> isn't there, ask for the person trading Florida.  Malory (don't know her last name or her number) has been backing <NAME/> up this week.  Reliant has the option of giving us the gas in Z2 or Z3 at a Z2 GD price.  <NAME/> will also let us take different volumes on different days over the weekend, even though it hasn't happened before.

Have a good weekend!
