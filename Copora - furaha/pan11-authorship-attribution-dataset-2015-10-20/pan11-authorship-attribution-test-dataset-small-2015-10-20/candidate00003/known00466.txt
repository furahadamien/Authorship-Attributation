

Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to <NAME/> Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, <NAME/> <NAME/> (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  <NAME/> Vrana (713-752-4514) with <NAME/> <NAME/> is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  

Just spoke with <NAME/> (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing <NAME/> but he has worked with Harlam <NAME/>?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.

<NAME/>, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.
