

Jerry DeBerry called, and asked that <NAME/> call <NAME/> Evans to get a handle on the correct number for the wire transfer.  Once it is agreed, please send me an email with the revised number.

We were working off of different receipt dates.  I received the fax on Monday, and they believe it was delivered here the Friday before.  That is the reason for the different expectation on the closing date.

<NAME/> Duran would like to be advised before the transfer is made.  I presume that <NAME/> or <NAME/> will take care of talking to <NAME/> so that the transfer can be made tomorrow.

Thanks,

<NAME/>
