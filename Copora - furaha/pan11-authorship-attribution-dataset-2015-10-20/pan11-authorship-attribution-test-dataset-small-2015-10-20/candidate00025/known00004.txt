

<NAME/>,

The draft opinion is going to <NAME/> Polk as we speak.  <NAME/> is going to try to find out if they will comment tonight.  <NAME/> <NAME/> had some comments on the Certificate of Secretary, and I passed the comment along through <NAME/>.

We are putting together diligence folders in connection with the opinions (what the heck).  We'll tee up the next round of companies once we get the list.  <NAME/> was going to talk to someone at WGM to confirm which ones are going in next.

I'm still here.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.
