Physical Trading

East - The East did not notice any credit hording in the morning.  In the afternoon Tractebel is buying the physical balance of month .04 over the GD swap

Central - Dynegy Canada sold most of the gas to us.  The desk bid was .05 over NGX.  Nicor Hub would not accept an $87 pre-pay for a wheeling fee.

West - EOL Socal cash was trading .08 higher than ICE Socal.  The desk finished short and the market made it very difficult to buy.  EOL SJ cash traded .10 to .20 cents lower than ICE.  The only point without a credit spread was <NAME/>.  Liquidity picked up slightly from Thursday and Friday, but still slow.

AEP was noticeably absent from all regions.
