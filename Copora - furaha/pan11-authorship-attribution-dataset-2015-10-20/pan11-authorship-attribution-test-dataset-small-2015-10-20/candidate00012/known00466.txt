

Team, I would like for you to review the attached Shipper assignment list.  With <NAME/> leaving and
	<NAME/> still on a learning curve, I wanted to throw out some possibilities and get your input.  I did not
	spend a lot of time on interconnects, so you may want to look at those closely.  I did talk with <NAME/>,
	Terry, Raetta and <NAME/> for input.  Please review, discuss and set up some time to visit with me about
	your comments.  Thanks. <NAME/>
