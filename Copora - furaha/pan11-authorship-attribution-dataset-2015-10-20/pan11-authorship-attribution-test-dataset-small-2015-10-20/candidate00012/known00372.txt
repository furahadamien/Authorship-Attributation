    me the schedule for the weekends now that you have <NAME/> and <NAME/> on the weekends?
    Plus I would like to know what customers you gave <NAME/> and <NAME/> from a scheduling perspective
    and what you took away from them from an accounting perspective to even the workloads.
    Could one of you schedule some time with me and <NAME/> to review the above questions?
    Thanks. <NAME/>
