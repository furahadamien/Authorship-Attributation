

<NAME/>, I will be out of the office on Monday, Oct. 22nd., but <NAME/> and <NAME/> can work with
	<NAME/> and the team to meet on MOPS scheduling.  I would like for you to meet with
	<NAME/> and <NAME/> before the 22nd to be sure we are comfortable with what information to
	pass back and forth.  

	<NAME/>, would you take the lead working with <NAME/> and <NAME/> to cover the meeting on Monday.

	Thanks. <NAME/>
