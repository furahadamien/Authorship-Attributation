

<NAME/>, thank you for the update.  My only concern now is the file <NAME/>
sent us last night took 13 hours to load (I am not sure it ever loaded).
I know <NAME/> is diligently working on this, hopefully he can get this fixed
this weekend.  <NAME/> has a call into <NAME/> to see if we need someone available
this weekend to help test.  Thanks again for your support and follow up.
