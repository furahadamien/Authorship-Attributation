

An update on our change for the Storage Allocation.  Several questions
have come up over the weekend.  The weekend crew is documenting the
questions.  I have left <NAME/> Bodnar and <NAME/> Buchanan a phone mail message
to research the questions and concerns on Monday.  Then we will group with
storage and determine what changes need to be made.

One change we talked about on the Sunday morning call with storage is to
be able to use SBS on the non allocated portion of storage.  ie, if we are
allocating injections, then withdrawals should still use SBS.  If we are allocating
withdrawals, then injections should still have access to SBS.  <NAME/> Bodnar will
pursue this enhancement further.  Thanks. <NAME/>
