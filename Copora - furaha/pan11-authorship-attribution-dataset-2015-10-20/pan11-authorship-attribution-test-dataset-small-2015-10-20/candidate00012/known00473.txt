

On September 24, 2001, <NAME/> gave each of you a list of your outstanding accounts receivable
	back to January, 1998.  In meeting with <NAME/> today, I understand, we have NOT cleaned up very
	many of these issues.
	
	<NAME/> will be getting with each one of you AGAIN to review your accounts.  My expectation is
	that there has been some clean up activity before Performance Reviews at which time I will
	ask <NAME/> for an update.  <NAME/>, Raetta and <NAME/> are all available as needed to help you in
	this effort.

	All clean up should be completed by December 31, 2001.
