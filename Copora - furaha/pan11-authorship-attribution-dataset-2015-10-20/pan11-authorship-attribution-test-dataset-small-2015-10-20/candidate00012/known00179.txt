

<NAME/>, I am looking forward to the meeting in October as well as meeting you.  I wanted to let you know 
	ETS would like to add one more person to list for the meeting.  <NAME/> Hess is now in the ETS Gs Logistics
	group and I think it would be beneficial for her to attend.  Please add <NAME/> on any future emails.  Her
	email address is theresa.hess@enron.com.  In talking with <NAME/>, I think you are all booked up for the
	Sunday activity, but <NAME/> put <NAME/> on the list in case of a cancellation.  

	One topic I wouldl ike to talk about at the meeting:  is the "mis matches" across interconnecting
	pipelines at the Intraday 2 cycle.  This is still a concern for the <NAME/> pipes and I wold like to know
	if anyone has come up with any "great" ideas on minimizing these mismatches.  If you would like
	to discuss further, please call me (713) 853-7637.  

	Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you on October 21.  Thanks. <NAME/>
