

<NAME/>:

Per our conversation, attached is a short "recap" of the companies and amounts involved.

With respect to prime brokerage accounts, the following approximate cash balances are held by Bear Stearns & Co. ("Bear") in accounts for the following companies:

<NAME/> North America Corp.	$159,022		[filing debtor]

ECT Investments, Inc.		$3,923,970.84		[has not filed]

<NAME/> Credit Inc.		$10,500,000		[has not filed]

I understand that one of our U.K. companies, <NAME/> Credit Limited, has been in touch with one of your employees with respect to the return of the <NAME/> Credit Inc. cash and was told that Bear wished to offset that amount against the amount owed by <NAME/> Credit Limited to Bear under OTC trades, approx. $1,500,000, for a net balance of approx. $9,000,000.

ECT Investments Inc. sent a demand letter to you via facsimile on November 30, 2001 requesting return of its cash balance.  I do not believe that ECT Investments, Inc.has any OTC trades with Bear but I will need to verify.

We would like to resolve the return of cash issues.  Please feel free to contact me.

Thanks for your assistance.
