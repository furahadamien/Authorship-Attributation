

<NAME/> Ng at Morgan has requested that trades in the names of <NAME/> Liquid Fuels, Inc. ("ELFI"), <NAME/> Reserve Acquisition Corp. and <NAME/> Gas Liquids (physical and financial) be "novated" or transferred to ENA.  <NAME/> is aware that this is a credit issue.

I have copies of four (4) financial confirms between Morgan and ELFI.  These were produced by Morgan for Trade Dates February 28, 2001 (30,000 BBL total ethane), March 6, 2001 (30,000 BBL total propane),March 26, 2001 (150,000 BBL total propane) and March 26, 2001 (150,000 BBL total propane).

<NAME/> has probably contacted <NAME/> Hodge and/or <NAME/> Aronowitz on the physical side with the same request.

Thanks.  <NAME/>
