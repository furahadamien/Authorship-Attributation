I'll be brief.  We received an objection from Nuevo (wants to use Monday, Sept. 10 price).  <NAME/> Andrews (Treasurer) sent the letter and I left him a voice mail.  The ENA trader is <NAME/> Berkeland and <NAME/> suggested that <NAME/> handle this customer (since it's <NAME/>'s customer).  Nuevo neglected to read our ISDA (all standard language) and we actually fall into the "ENA averages two quotes" scenario.  <NAME/> should try to negotiate this one.  I left <NAME/> a voice mail and <NAME/> will contact <NAME/> in the a.m.  <NAME/> is aware of this situation.
