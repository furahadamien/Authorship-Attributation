We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to <NAME/>'s SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in <NAME/>'s past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection")
If <NAME/> collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change
If <NAME/> has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
<NAME/> can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
<NAME/> cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
<NAME/> can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
<NAME/> will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of <NAME/>'s rates)
The PUC will not fine <NAME/> during this period if <NAME/>'s capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure
<NAME/> must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
<NAME/> agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announced

We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

Best,
<NAME/>
