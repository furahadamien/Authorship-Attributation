We're going to hold our 11:30 call in an attempt to maintain a sense of normalcy.  Call will be brief.  With respect to Hap, <NAME/>'s asked me to hold off talking to him until <NAME/> signals.  I agreed.  I'll keep you posted.  The State Capitol is closed down completely today.  Be safe.
 
Best,
<NAME/>
