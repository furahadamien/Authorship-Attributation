However, if <NAME/> wanted to go and report back, then a) he gets information which likely doesn't hurt their business and b) the "Estate" doesn't incur the cost of <NAME/> traveling to Sacramento to a meeting that likely won't have a huge amount of value.  But if <NAME/> ain't interested, he ain't interested.  That's my take.  

Best,
<NAME/>
