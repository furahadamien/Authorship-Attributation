

<NAME/>, I am saddened to learn that Linklaters' policy requires that your term as senior partner must soon come to an end.  I trust, however, that you will continue to be active at Linklaters, and I look forward to continuing our working relationship and friendship.  With respect to the proposed visit by <NAME/> Cann on Monday, I regret that I will be on the east coast on that day.  I do look forward to meeting him, either in <NAME/> or on one of my trips to London.  All the best to you and Linklaters. <NAME/>
