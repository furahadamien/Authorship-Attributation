

<NAME/>- Thanks for your note. Before <NAME/> D. left she had requested additional resources and we began making arrangements to get people in place. We have assigned Tracy Ngo, <NAME/> Sacks, <NAME/> Radous and <NAME/> Conwell to power. We also have moved other RAC people into credit, <NAME/> Ruane (VP), <NAME/> Curry (Dir), and <NAME/> North (Mgr). Unfortunately it takes some time to get these people trained on transactional credit issues but they should come along quickly. We are in the market for more.

It might be helpful to know if we could clone Tracy, how many would you need, given your plans in the market. Tracy is one of our best people. Also, does being in <NAME/> work or do we need resources in Portland. 

I'll meet w/ Tracy next week when she is in <NAME/> and get her views as well. 

Please don't hesitate to let me know if we aren't keeping up and of course if you are gearing up for a new market push and anticipate additional needs let us know ASAP because there is a 12 month or so training period required for a strong performer to get up the <NAME/> curve. Thanks, <NAME/>
