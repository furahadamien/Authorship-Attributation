

<NAME/>,
 
I hope you feel better. I have seen the message from <NAME/> in which he confirmed
that he approached the Research in <NAME/> on his own. He did not
receive any encouragement from me and from <NAME/>. I hope this closes this issue.
 
I can understand <NAME/>'s motivation but don't endorse the way he takes to reach his goals.
He hopes to accomplish more in a larger group where he can have more interaction with his peers
who have similar backgrounds. I think also that he developed an appreciation for good interpersonal 
relations in my group he could observe during his stay in <NAME/>.
 
My advice is to try to figure out how to use his skills for <NAME/> and how to develop his social
intelligence.
 
 
<NAME/>
