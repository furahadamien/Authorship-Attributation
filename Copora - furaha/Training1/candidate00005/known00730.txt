Please keep <NAME/> & <NAME/> in the loop on this question.  They are both working on next steps for NERC and while not directly related to the RSB, there is potential for overlap down the road.

Also, where does <NAME/> publicly stand on the incorporation of this into an EISB?  I thought we were ready to go?  Finally, are you giving the presentation?
