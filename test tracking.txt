Currently Running:
- demo10: HP-10 for the 50 document 10 author setting (0.1dt)
- demo10copy: WP-10 for the 10 author, 50 document setting (0.1dt)
- demo5: HP-5 for the 5 author 100 document setting (0.1dt)
- demo8: HP-3, HP-10, WP-3, WP-10, Blog-3, Blog-10 for 20 document (0.05dt)


Needed to Fill Table:
- 100 docs per 5 authors for WP, blogs [5Corpus, demo5]
- HP-10 (20), WP-10 (20), Blogs-10 (20) (0.5dt)
- HP-5 (20, WP-5 (20), Blogs-5 (20) (0.1dt)

















EXPECTED RUNTIMES: (started at 1:50pm)
-> for 3 authors, = 60docs * 10s/doc = 10min
-> for 5 authors, = 100docs * 10s/doc = 16min
-> for 10 authors, = 200docs * 10s/doc = 33min
-> for 50 authors, = 1000docs * 10s/doc = 166min (2.7h)

[DONE] SVM1: running the full set of test suites in order
-> gb, hp, blog, wp in order of 3, 5, 10 and 3, 10, 50 respectively by corpus
>> aim to cancel when gb finishes and switch over to blog-50
SO FAR: gb-3, gb-5, gb-10

SVM2: running tests on wp, blog, hp in that order with [50, 10, 3] lengths in that order 
>> aim to cancel when wp 50, 10, 3 are all finished
SO FAR: wp-50(+) - gave up after 7h (3h testing)
- restarted with 10 for wp !!

[DONE] SVM3: running tests on blog corpus on 3, 10, 50
SO FAR: blog-3, blog-10 

[DONE] SVM4: running tests on hp corpus on 3, 10, 50
>> aim to cancel when 3 and 10 are finished
SO FAR: hp-3, hp-10

[TERM] SVM5: running tests on hp corpus on 50
SO FAR: hp-50(+) - gave up after 7h --> NB: it looks like after 400 lines in a corpus, SVM takes AGES to do feature extraction but even longer to just TRAIN the model

SVM-5Corpus: running tests on 5 authors with 100 documents each (400:100 total) on gb, hp, wp, blog
>> might want to try and parallelize when possible
SO FAR: gb-5, hp-5

[DONE] SVM6: running tests on austen vs. pp fanfiction on 10 authors combined vs Jane Austen herself 
[DONE] SVM6: running the same test but splitting it back into 10 separate author labels again 

SVM7: blog on 50
SO FAR: blog-50(+) - gave up after 7h

[TERM] SVM100: hp, blog, wp on 100 authors with reduced # documents 
>> aim to cancel and start another for just the blog when some of the other SVM stuff finishes 

SVM10: hp, blog, wp on 10 authors with increased # documents 
SO FAR: gb-10, hp-10(+)

SVM10-Copy: blog on 10 authors with increased # documents 
SO FAR: blog-10, wp-10

SVM8: hp, wp, blog on 3, 10 authors with 25 documents and INTEGRAND modified
SO FAR: hp-3, hp-10(+)

SVM9: hp, wp, blog on 3, 10 with 20 documents each and INTEGRAND modified 

SVM520:
>> stop this after it finishes wp and hp 
- repeat SVM but with 5 authors instead for wp, hp, and blog 

SVM520 copy:
- handle the blog corpus
