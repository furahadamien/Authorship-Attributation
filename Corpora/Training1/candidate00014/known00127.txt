what are you having at burger inn?  

it has been too long - we'll have to fix it.  what are you doing this w/e?  

i feel like i've been sick for two weeks, and i haven't been doing much, mostly taking care of errands etc since i don't have much to do at work these days.  hopefully that will be changing soon.  

um, chrissy is much too cute to be playing with her toys alone.  

i'm not sure why lucky sucked - i think it was the crowd we met up with there.  you two should have come and it would have been more fun i'm sure.
