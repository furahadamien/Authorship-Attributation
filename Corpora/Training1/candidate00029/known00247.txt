

I had a conversation with <NAME/> <NAME/> and <NAME/> <NAME/> Browning this morning re: ECTRIC and the London process.

<NAME/> has generated both an in and out -of-the-money list which he will forward so that <NAME/> can review for counterparty termination accuracy.  I think that London can use our newly established processes as a template.  <NAME/> and others will participate in the 9:30 a.m. conference call Feb. 6.

<NAME/> and Bjorn:  Can you provide a <NAME/> with a copy of the "Star Gas Propane, L.P." template, or if this has been replaced, a copy of the most recent template?  Also, the "Liquidation of Price Risk Management Book" template?

<NAME/>:  Can you provide <NAME/> and <NAME/> <NAME/> with a copy of the decision tree and settlement process flowchart?

If the handouts for tomorrow will be ready and incorporate the above, the handouts are all that London will need.

Thanks.  SS
