From an historical perspective, it has always been my understanding that <NAME/> Corp. did not wish to provide guaranties to brokers and we have been successful in that regard with several recent exceptions.  In particular, <NAME/> Corp. provided Carr with a "comfort letter" reciting the corporate "policy of general financial responsibility and interest in seeing that subsidiaries act responsibly."  [letter dated February 16, 1999]  Such letter is no longer sufficient to satisfy Credit Agricole which owns Carr.  

Joe, I believe that <NAME/> may have already spoken with you.  I don't know if your conversation included discussion of a guaranty.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.
