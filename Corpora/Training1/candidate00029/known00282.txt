

Please leave me a voice mail or email and advise what phone number to call.  <NAME/> Aronowitz (if available), <NAME/> Ellenberg (Cadwalader in New York) and I would like to speak with you about the possibility of immediate assistance which will blend into the <NAME/> process and institutional knowledge.

We are anxious to speak with you before the dial-in conference call.

Please let me know.  Thanks.
