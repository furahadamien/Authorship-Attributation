

<NAME/>:

The customers appearing on <NAME/>'s list have been assigned to various lawyers in the swap group.  There are 22 parties on the list and 16 of these parties have ISDA Master Agreements with ENA.  We will focus on the ISDA customers first.  We will use the template developed by <NAME/> for Entergy-Koch as a basis for the 16 parties.  The template will be customized for each of the 16 parties.  <NAME/> has a preliminary template underway and it should be further refined by October 19.  Using that  template, our goal is to produce six (6) new amendments each week.  We should finish the ISDA customers in about three weeks (first drafts).  The remaining customers have no master agreement in place or an ECT Master Agreement.  Those six (6) customers include:

	Sempra Energy Trading Corp. (old master)
	Morgan <NAME/> Capital Group Inc. (old master)
	Dynegy Marketing and Trade (old master)
	Ameren Energy (none)
	American Electric Service Power Corporation (none)
	PacificCorp Power Marketing Inc. (under negotiation with ECC)

The physical power group can coordinate the amendments with the members of the swap group listed above by forwarding drafts to us.

Please let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks.  <NAME/>
