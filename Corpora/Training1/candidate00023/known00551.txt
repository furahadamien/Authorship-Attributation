

<NAME/>,

Do you have a standard presentation on <NAME/>'s role in creating and
growing the spot and forward markets for pulp and paper?

We are helping the media group to make a pitch to a big
customer ($40 billion in revenues) and we would like to provide some examples of our 
skills in creating and growing new markets.


<NAME/>

P.S. It's quite urgent: we were asked to help at the eleventh hour.
