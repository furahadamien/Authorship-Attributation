

Thank you very much for your kind voicemail.  Unfortunately for Gov't Affairs, unless <NAME/> and <NAME/> have other plans, you all are stuck with me since I love working for <NAME/> (even in California!).  Bizarre rumor, the origins of which baffle me....

Thanks again for the sweet voicemail.  And holy moly, sounds like you and <NAME/> are going to be extremely busy at FERC.

Best,
<NAME/>
