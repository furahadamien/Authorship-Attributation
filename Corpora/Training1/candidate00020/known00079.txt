<NAME/> said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.  The link is http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from Socal).  Also, we need to start entering the <NAME/> basin numbers under the Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, <NAME/> Hyde is working to set up the page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.
