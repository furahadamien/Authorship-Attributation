

<NAME/>,

Last night I spoke to two potential candidates for the trading track, <NAME/> Carlsson and <NAME/> Considine.

<NAME/> is currently tutoring at Hofstra after leaving an option trading position.  I would recommend bringing <NAME/> to <NAME/> for further interviews based on his technical knowledge.  The biggest drawback was his current situation might show a lack of motivation.

<NAME/> was working as an equity market maker.  He is interested in making a change to a job where he can develop more expertise.  He is seeking to develop a better understanding of the market he trades.  The trading track would be an excellent match for his desires.  I would also recommend bringing <NAME/> to <NAME/> for further consideration.
