

<NAME/>,

Have you received the assignment letter from <NAME/> Kolb.  This letter makes it sound like the assumption is just between the Kuo's and Success Real Estate.  <NAME/>'t they need something signed from Southern Pacific Bank?

I certainly don't plan on signing any assignment documents before the release is signed and settled.  Has their attorney contacted you with any revisions?  Is the ball in their court?
