The two RMEF persons we met with are <NAME/> <NAME/> and <NAME/> Kerby.  <NAME/> is the regional director for NM and TX.  <NAME/> was the guy we picked up at the airport from Montana.  I think his title was VP of business operations?  His number is 1-800-225-5355.  <NAME/>'s number in Las Vegas NM is 505-454-9390.  <NAME/> that all is well with you and the family.
