I slowly lifted the satin duvet off my frail body.I reoriented my body so that I was sitting on the edge of my bed.Upon peeking at my weak knees and thin translucent skin on my legs, I began to cry.I traced my blue thick veins with my eyes and was struck with the nightmare that was currently my lifeI am aging.Only a few weeks prior was I enjoying my frivolous life as a 25 years old.Now, I realized that I could not pinpoint my age, however it was well past 25.It was disgusting.I rose from my king sized bed, peering over my shoulder to see the empty spot next to me.After my first signs of age, Ryan left me instantly, practically ashamed to have been sleeping with an elder lady.The thought of Ryan brought tears to my eyes again, and I blinked them away to clear my vision.What else would he have done?I would never expect a youthful gentleman like him to remain with a woman turning into a prune.I passed by my golden mirror and didnt dare glance at it, for I knew I would be petrified by the ghastly sight.I dragged myself to the kitchen where I grabbed the bottle of anti-depressants.I then settled on the couch and nestled myself in my unwashed bathrobe, allowing the tears to continuously flow down my face.I decided that I should take my mind off this agony and sat up a bit so that I could reach for the remote.A cold shudder raced through my body as I saw the face I have been trying to avoid for so longme.Through the glistening black screen TV I saw my sagging face and streaks that ran across my face.As I cried, I watched as the corners of my eyes creased extensively to mimic the feet of a crow.A monster, I whispered as I ran through my frigid hair.Im going to die just at the sight of my dysfunctional face.I needed to check and see.I needed to see how far along I am.After the announcement about the failure of the drug to hold, members of the Lost Generation were equipped with a watch that informed them how old there features look at a certain moment.I activated the watch, and shuddered at the number that was blinking before my eyes.35.
