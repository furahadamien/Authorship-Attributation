I'd known Payton was something else for a while.What exactly I didn't know at first, just that she was the perfect mix of girl next door and seductress.We spent some time actively trying to hate each other back in high school, then we tried not to fall in love so we didn't have to deal with long distance.It didn't work - after almost a year of avoiding it, I asked her out about two weeks before I left for college.Things had their ups and downs, but all in all we were pretty good together.Or so I thought.She eventually dumped me out of the blue for not fixing something she never told me needed fixing.She went on a tech cleanse shortly after, making it near impossible to hold a conversation with her because she was always busy or avoiding her phone.So as much as I wanted to stay on touch, she made it frustratingly difficult, and after she'd hurt me so much without really apologizing I was done thinking of her.Years went by.I dated a few folks, had a few hookups.I wound up going into industry for a few years before getting my PhD instead of getting it all done at once.On the plus side, I don't think I would have considered Pompeu Fabra University way back then, and damn is Barcelona gorgeous.And apparently the locals went crazy over a towering American with an undercut.(Well, towering by European standards anyways.)Everything in my life was going fairly good when it had happened - I was on break, getting some cash so I could ask Isabella out to get some coffee.Or I was until the guy in front of me pulled out a pistol and started yelling for everybody to get on the ground.I immediately complied, wishing my concealed carry permit was valid here.I heard a few guys talking, telling people to stay down or let go of their purse or to open the drawer and put the money in the bag.I silently cursed when I felt a hand take my wallet from my back pocket.His curse, however, was very much not silent."Mald*icon*," he said, almost groaning at the end."Ral, mira."I heard footsteps and prayed I wasn't about to be shot for causing trouble."Mierda."The new voice - presumably Ral - sounded as distressed after the first.After a pause, I felt a boot poke my leg as he said "Lev- eh, stand please."Not wanting to question the switch to my native tongue, I stood slowly, and took the wallet he held out to me - wait, my wallet?"Great apologies, seor Allen.Please, take these for the troubles we have caused."He reached into his pocket and pulled out several large bills.As I took them, he added, "Just please, do not tell La Diablita."I would have asked a question if I could have figured out which one to start with, but he evidently didn't have time to explain; he barked some orders to his men and they left promptly.After a moment of standing around confused, I snapped out of it.If I was going to solve this on my own I was going to need to *not* waste days in a holding cell letting the beauracracy try to decide if I was an accomplice or not.I handed a couple bills to a lady crying over her purse, then made a beeline for a teller."Tienes una puerta de atrs?"They hesitated a moment until I gave them another bill, then let me out the back.Hearing sirens, I hoped it would take them at least a day to work out who I was.Nonetheless, I acted like I only had an hour.I made my way to my apartment, trying to figure out who "The Little She-Devil" was.She was apparently big crime boss, managing a syndicate that spanned from the Atlantic to Germany.Little was known about her, but it was suspected she had some sort of mental illness or was at the very least extremely indecisive; the syndicate changed fairly regularly and without reason.For a couple years it went by the name of "Speed Demons" in French and focused on high-end car theft, then for no apparent reason the organization lost its name and prioritized black market firearms.Also of curiosity, "La Diablita" was treated as a title rather than a name, and was translated into whichever language was convenient at the time.Apparently, their activity was focused in southern France, so that's where I decided to search first.I grabbed some essentials from my apartment and made my way to the train station, contacting a couple friends I had in the area.It'd take me about four hours to reach Montpellier, so hopefully someone would be willing to take me in for a day or two.Jesus, what am I getting into...

Apparently, a four hour train ride was not enough time to answer that question.Nor was the time I spent catching up with my college buddy Adalie, or meeting her friend-of-a-friend who owned and operated a bar and was involved in some illicit activities.It was early afternoon on a Tuesday, so there were few people out.I sat at the bar, which was being tended by a large man in a button-up who clearly took care of his bushy beard."Parles-tu Anglais ou Espagnol?"I spoke a little French, but not enough to discuss such a niche topic.Especially with my mind still racing."Yes, English.What can I get you?"It was really my lucky day."Information, and brandy while we discuss it.You're Marcus, right?"He became wary, but poured my drink nonetheless - probably confident in his staff's ability to take care of me if needed."Depends, why do you ask?""I'm trying to contact someone so I can thank them for saving my life.I think you know of Me Petit Diable?"He paused, clearly curious as I sipped my drink."Saved your life?Who are you?"Now for the moment of truth."Allen Garthen.""Connerie.Show me proof."So my name was well-known.I took out my passport and laid it on the bar so he could see.He studied it for a minute, then looked at me again."Fine.If you are who you say you are, you'll need to talk to a portier - a gatekeeper.But I'm warning you, they will know if you are lying, and you do not want to find out what happens if you lie about this subject.""Well that's my concern, not yours.Can you arrange a meeting?""I will make an appointment.Return here at seven and I will tell you what to do next."~~~
