Nomad003
This affirmation awakens something inside of me... my dormant super powers awaken!I use Magneto powers to toss cars off the road that fail to signal.With eyes and heart opened with love I finally decipher the clues to a treasure map my grandfather left me in his will.It leads to a time machine where I go back in time and kill Hitler (who turn out to a time traveler version of Pee Wee Herman) and marry Marilyn Monroe before her big break and bring her to the present.The timeline has changed but I still know I am loved and accepted and it's Christmas.Also I stopped off a few years ago and bought $100 of bitcoin at $0.02.P.s.Turns out my dad is Santa and I am taking over his job next year.I only have one year to train.
