The Gospels According to Brad:

After their dissent in Damascus, Chad and Brad were sent to Adath, in the lands of the Samaritans.Paul bade them to shoulder the greatest challenge of any of the disciples, and to bring the word of The Lord to those that openly mocked the followers of Christ.Chad insisted that it was actually a punishment and humiliation for their behaviour at the Last Supper, that it was really a slight.But Chad doesn't know shit.When they came to Adath, the sun was low on the horizon and the two disciples were weary from their long voyage.Chad had forgotten to water both their camels at the last oasis, only giving his own camel the Lord's gift of water in the desert.So the disciples arrived sand-blown and tired, ridding double-hump on one camel.The land of Samar was in the middle of a harvest festival, and Adath was filled with merrymakers.Just as their Lord before them, Brad and Chad were unable to find any room in the inns.Brad knew it was a sign from the Lord, blessing their mission.He looked for a manger, that they may follow in their God's footsteps.However, the closest thing to a manger was a chicken coop that an incredulous stall vendor agreed to let them for the night, provided his chickens could bed with them.But not in the Biblical sense.Because that is wrong.We did hash that over before, but to avoid anyone saying that's only Old Testament stuff, we're gonna mention it again:  Don't fuck chickens.Or cloven-hoof animals.Or the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea, or the lizards that walk the sand.Any animal really.The only think you're allowed to bang is humans.Preferably in a heterosexual monogamous union ordained and approved by the local church authority.Subject to all applicable fees and taxes.Sex toys might be okay, but they also might fall under the category of masturbation.Because of ongoing litigation between Durex and the church, our attorney has asked us not to comment on the matter.Anyways, There Chad and Brad laid their heads, among the chickens.Chad was a real buzzkill about the whole ordeal, but it was clearly a sign the Lord had good things planned for the two devotees.When morning came, the two emerged, feather-spattered and unrested, but ready to do Paul's bidding.They set up shop right near the chicken coup, near a bustling fountain, to begin their sermon.Chad was totally oblivious to how convenient their accommodations right in the market were.While the villagers drew their morning buckets, Chad and Brad stood next to the trickling water and told the pagans the Word of the Lord.Some of them looked to the noble figures, silhouetted by the rising sun.However, most of them paid no heed.Their eyes were sunken and red.They shuffled as though the weight of the Devil was upon them.After a few hours, Chad finally asked an old woman why no one was paying attention to them.The bent crone told them they were in the middle of the Winter Festival.The revelry had lasted late into the night and the villagefolk were feeling the after effects of the wine that was customary at the festival.Undaunted, Chad and Brad continued their preaching.At noon, across the fountain, emerged a local holy man.He wore no shirt, just pants in the style of MC of Hammers.His long dreadlocks were beaded with bright ornaments that twinkled when he nodded his head with great enthusiasm, which he did often.The crowd cheered when he took his place opposite Chad and Brad.A fervent follower threw him a hand harp from the masses and the he began to strum it while a circle of drummers dropped him a beat.He began to sing in a style unknown to Chad and Brad.It went thus:

Woke up quick at about noon

Just knew that I had to be proselytizin' soon

I gotta get drunk before the day begins

Before Demeter's pain really sets in

About to go and that gin got me near blind

--At this point he gestured rudely at Chad and Brad--

Young niggaz was here, throwing up Christ signs

So I ran to my bros and I grabbed my harp

I got the beat here and side to side.The crowd even sang along in perfect stereo to 'side to side.'If there was one thing that Chad and Brad could agree on, it was that the devil's hand had been at work that day.The  priest's demonic chanting continued for some time.His words were not from any song they had heard before.And it hinted at pagan prophecy, because he sang about Chad and Brad, though no songs had ever been composed about them before.Likely, they will sing of Chad and Brad in the future, but they hadn't at that point.Yet the man's lyrics called them out by name.The warlock conjured up facts about them, some of them eerily accurate, like Chad's celibacy, and Brad's mother's past as a destitute prostitute in the streets of Jerusalem.It got quite graphic.Chad and Brad both tried their best to summon words from thin air as the warlock did.They asked the Lord above, in the name of their saviour, to grant them this gift of rhythmic song conjuring.The Lord's blessing was not with them.They attempted to draw attention to the man's strange manner of hair.But the crowd jeered at their attempts and lauded the Warlock's 'sick dreads.'Despite his almost-complete musical undergrad, Chad wasn't able to muster anything near the power of the Demonic Warlock.He parleyed with an off-beat and stuttering insult at the likelihood that the Demonic Warlock was inflicted with venereal disease because of the numerous sexual encounters he boasted of.And that that was a mighty blow on him from the Lord Above.That's when the rocks started flying.It began as a light barrage of handfuls of sand and pebbles.But Chad had to go and make one last comment about the local honey mead and it quickly escalated to a bombardment.Some of the missiles lobbed were as big as two fists held together.And like a big guy's fists.And Samaritans have really good throwing arms.It isn't that important of a detail, but Chad insisted that it be included in these gospels since we flipped a coin to see who had to write about this part, and he said he just wasn't going to mention any of this in his book.So it was, that as the sun dipped low on the horizon, the two champions of God's word were chased by a throng of mindless zombies conjured up by the Mouth of Satan who had manifested himself as a dreadlocked Demon Warlock with music and mind-control powers.In the chaos that ensued, they couldn't find their camel and were chased from the city on bare feet.Alone in the cold desert, the two disciples ran until they were pretty sure they couldn't see any torches or pitchforks in the distance.They both agreed they were at an all-time low.Clearly, the Lord was testing them.Without fuel to make a fire, Chad and Brad laid with each-other in a shallow cave.NOT in the Biblical sense.Though it might be cool if people do that.We're still not totally sure.Also, pending litigation, we can't state our...  yadda yadda yadda.The smaller spoon, Chad, asked over his shoulder, as the cold wind blew in, if they were going to be okay?Or if they might perish of exposure in alarmingly fast dropping temperatures.Brad thought sagely and whispered in his brother's ear: It is clear the Lord is testing us, and we must simply stay the course.Besides, they had done as the other disciples had asked.They had made the long journey, found accommodation, and preached the Word of God.Sure, there were some snags, but God was clearly just following the three act structure.They had arrived victorious, been defeated by Satan Himself Incarnate, but, for real, what mortals could hope to stand up to Satan Himself Incarnate?The had fought hard, but been bested.Now that the second act was over, it was their turn to win.That seemed to calm Chad enough, because he answered only with quiet snores.Under the icy moonlight, in dangerously cooling temperatures, the two disciples slept, spoon to spoon, safe in the knowledge that the worst was behind them, and that God would send them a mentor who would teach them awesome powers.Then they could fight Satan in a 2v1.Though, that would still be unfair.Brad's thoughts became more and more muddled and he decided to stop writing about their day and get some sleep too.But, for real, it's getting really cold.There's frost on the sand dunes and everything.Thankfully, they did wake in the morning.However, it appeared the second act wasn't totally over, because Chad lost three fingers to frostbite.Two from one hand, three from the other, and Brad had to cut them off to prevent gangrene.It was really gross and Chad still hasn't said thank you.Even though he had been delirious and resisted so hard that Brad had to knock him unconscious and tie him down before he could perform the life-saving surgery.To be continued in The Gospels According to Brad, Chapter Two: The First Legit Rap Battle In History.With way more music.Also, a few cameos from other major Biblical figures that wanted to try and piggyback and Chad and Brad's early success.EDIT: Sorry about the typos.If there was dollar bills involved, I'd give a fuck.-Chad
