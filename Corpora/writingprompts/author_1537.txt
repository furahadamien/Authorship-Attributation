I think Saint Nicholas was the first, and that's back when Santa's were allowed to live among people all year round, with the caveat that they spend their life giving gifts to others.Saint Nick's good deeds wrote him into a legend which spread around the world like wildfire.After the legend spread, the elves realised that the fire had burned too big and bright, because the story was powerful, and like any powerful story, it can easily fall into the wrong hands-- hands that will twist and turn the words like yarn-- A master craftsman can make his make his material into whatever he wants.Coca-cola eventually made up their closest approximation to saint Nick wearing their brand colours, sitting in a sleigh drawn by reindeer racing through the sky.Their ad campaign sparked a ridiculous number of impersonators setting up shop in their local mall, sitting on a gaudy red throne and taking kids on their lap to whisper the name of the toys that they coveted.Parents took it upon themselves go raid their local toy stores and spend their Christmas bonuses on gifts and wrapping paper.That's what I was told.And this is why I am the opposite of what the legend says.Because the workers have to keep us working.They have to keep some sort of universal force in motion, and this force is kept in motion by the spirit of generosity.The spirit of giving.This is why I can slip through walls, pass by like a cold gust.Nobody remembers my face, because I don't have one.But I have a purpose, and that purpose is to give to people something that they need.Has anything ever happened to you that you consider a "Christmas Miracle"?Something wonderful that happened by chance, something that can't be explained?..Maybe it was a twenty dollars bill on the ground when you had used up your last paycheck and you felt weak with hunger.Or maybe a  kind stranger that showed up at the right time.Someone that called an ambulance and wrapped you in their coat until it arrived.Someone who left before you could thank them.What about those lights that painted the sky beautiful colours at night?That was me.You wouldn't remember me, only the feeling in your chest that lets you know I'm there.It's a feeling of  excitement, some would describe it as the feeling of "being a kid again" 

(we focus more on helping children, sorry).That feeling of someone, somewhere out there looking after you, making sure you're okay?That's me.and I'll always be here for you when you need me.
