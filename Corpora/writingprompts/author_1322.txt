FlightlessFallen
The first time it happened, it was a shock.I recognized the yellow VW Beetle wrecked in the middle of the road.Her parents had given it to her for her sixteenth birthday... when we were still together.I called 911, I met her at the hospital.I told her that her fiance had died in the crash, but I couldn't bring myself to tell her how I'd come across the accident.She just wouldn't believe it.Our relationship began anew that day, but this time just as friends.The one girl I'd ever truly loved, just a friend.It was bittersweet, the joy of just having her back in my life eclipsed by the knowledge that she would never feel the same way as I did.I finally had to tell her the secret about a year later.She had seen me appear out of thin air, and at that point there was really no more denying it."What the hell just happened?"Steph asked, once the police had taken the robber from her house in handcuffs."You just... **appeared** behind him!""Well..." I hesitated, trying to find the words that didn't make me look like a lunatic."It happened in high school, when we were still dating.""**What** happened?You gained the ability to teleport?""Kinda, yeah.This will sound dumb but... You were the hot goth chick, and I was a boring normal teenager who played video games, and so I tried to get into goth stuff to impress you.""...Like magic?You thought I was some kind of Wiccan because I went through a black lipstick phase?""Yeah like magic, and rituals and, and paganism.That kind of thing.I read stuff so I could impress you.You were so... out of my league.I just thought eventually you'd figure out how lame I was and dump me.Which you did, by the way.Anyway, I ended up finding some translated version of a book of rituals from this ancient cult of Aphrodite.I practiced the ritual a few times, and once I'd gathered the courage, I wanted to do it in front of you.I thought it was all fake, so I didn't expect it to actually work.""So this is magic.Actual **Magic**.Look I really appreciate the help, but I don't need you appearing whenever I'm in trouble.I'm a grown woman and I can take care of myself.So, turn it off, ok?""I..." I hung my head in embarrassment, "I can't stop it.It lasts..."  
  
"Forever.Great."She sounded annoyed, almost angry.I had to tell her.Either she knew the truth and possibly reciprocated, or she assumed she'd been right and hated me forever.I took a deep breath and tried to calm myself."No...It lasts until I stop loving you."I watched her expression change from annoyed to shocked, to confused... To sad.She pitied me."Tom, we were kids, we weren't 'in love'.We weren't 'soul mates'.We were just a couple of kids in a small town.Just because we grew up together doesn't mean we were meant for each other.""I know, but I just...I've never been happy with anyone else.""I'm sorry, Tom, but I have.""I know.You talk about your new boyfriends all the time."The words came out more bitter than I'd intended."I think you should go home."She wouldn't return my calls after that.We saw each other a few other times.Once she'd slipped on ice and gotten a concussion.Another car crash.A flat tire in the middle of nowhere.She wouldn't speak to me, though.Nothing beyond a polite, "Thanks."A year had passed since she last needed me.I had almost been able to stop thinking about her when she started texting me.I ignored them, every one of them.I couldn't handle it again, the possibility that she finally felt the same way that I did, followed by the crushing realization that she never would.Today was the day.The day that all of my sadness, my loneliness, would end.I opened the door to Joy's building.I walked past the elevator and climbed the stairs.I had time.I couldn't help but think of Steph, even as I approached the door to my date's apartment.At number 513, I raised my hand to knock on the door, and thought of her again.I stopped.I couldn't do this.Not to myself, and not to Joy.She didn't deserve it.I went back to the stairs and stopped.I looked down, towards the exit, but I turned upwards.I took my phone out of my pocket.I texted to Joy, "Sorry to cancel on such short notice, but I'm not feeling well."As I reached the top of the stairs, I opened the door to the roof.A warm breeze touched my face as I held up my hand to shield my eyes from the sun.I had only a sneaking suspicion of why I was up there.I paced around the roof.What would my life be like from this point onward?Would I ever be happy?Could I?No, certainly not.Joy, who I'd met through a mutual friend, was everything I could ever want but for the fact that she wasn't Steph.Steph, though, didn't want me.I'd never be happy.Every time I thought I could be happy had turned out to be a lie.I knew, now, why I was here.It was the only answer.The only way to relieve the emptiness.The sadness.Erase it.A part of my mind screamed for me to stop, but I knew that was emotion and not logic speaking.I had already realized the truth.The truth carried me with slow steps onto the ledge.The truth spread my arms, and closed my eyes.Even in my last moments, I heard her voice in my head, "Tom?Tom what the fuck!What did you do?"I opened my eyes and saw her there, falling with me.The fear on her face and the realization of what she'd done, and what I'd done would haunt me for the rest of my life.
