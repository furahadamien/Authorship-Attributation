A man jumps out at you with a gun in a dark alley.He says, "I've got a wonderful gift for you.""A gift?"You ask.You wonder why he needs to point a gun at you to give you any gift."It's the gift of not getting shot in the chest."the man says."But I don't just give this gift to everyone.You have to meet my conditions to receive this gift.You must accept that your wallet is evil and give it to me.""What?"you ask."So it's do what you say or get shot?""That's the gift, yes."Begrudgingly, you hand over your wallet.He throws it to the ground and shoots it till it screeches."You are safe now.""Why did my wallet screech?"You ask."You see, money is the root of all evil.Money has been evolving for a very long time and it's become so powerful that it has taken control over all the humans that have become dependent on it.Your money is intelligent.It controls you every chance it gets.You must now learn to live without money."he says."Live without money?In this society?I can't!"you argue."You will if you want to receive my gift."he counters."The gift of not being shot in the chest, right?"you ask."That's right."He nods."Why do I feel so angry?I keep looking at my wallet and I feel like I could punch a wall."You remark."Yes, that is part of the parasite's mind control.It makes you want to see pain and suffering whenever money is destroyed.I've killed a great deal of money in my time, and the anger is unbearable.For the sake of the world, I keep going."he says."How do you deal with this feeling?"You ask honestly."I take it out on my son.It's a sacrifice for sure.But he's a good obedient kid who's never touched money.So when I slap him on one side of the face, he turns me his other cheek and patiently waits for me to slap that one as well.He knows I have to get out my anger to continue my quest to save the world.For I so love the world that I am giving my only begotten son to this cause.And whosoever shall believe me and give me their wallet will not perish but shall be free."he explains."This sounds familiar."you say."If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have the treasure of freedom.Then come, follow me."he says."Sell all my possessions?I thought the goal was to get rid of money!And if I give to the poor then are I not just passing the buck literally?"you ask."The poor spend their money quickly, long before the parasite can form a psychic hold on the host.The rich hold on to their money and make the rich even richer.Forgive them, those rich people, for they know not what they do.""What must I do then?"You ask."Follow me, for just as you love to catch pokemon in pokemon go, I will make you a catcher of men."You feel a twinge of regret at the idea of never becoming rich yourself."So I will never know wealth?""Truly I tell you.It is hard for someone who is rich to free themselves of these parasites.It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a sewing needle than for a rich man to free himself."he explains.You think about this."Well, if I was rich I could afford to have a really really big sewing needle made and buy some camels..."

"No!That's not the point."your mugger argues."Do you accept my gift or don't you?""The gift of not being shot in the chest?"you clarify."Yes.No man can serve two masters: for either he.will hate the one, and love the other; or else.he will hold to the one, and despise the other.You can not both serve our cause and love money.I'd rather shoot you than see you enslaved to wealth."he says.You and your mugger finally set out on your quest.Along the way you mug more people and convince each of them to free themselves of money.For decades, progress is slow.You are persecuted by rich people who's parasites cause them to see you as a threat.Yet steadily, you make progress.In time you have a large movement behind you.You gather large groups of people together once a week who drop all their money into a collection basket that is passed around so that the money can be safely burned.Eventually your movement grows so large that the only people left are the very rich and those who have no money at all.You have convinced 99% of the world to avoid money at all costs.People do not own property any more of any kind.Even owning a comb is considered blasphemy if you still have ten fingers in which to run through your hair.There comes a time when the collection plates run empty, for the poor have no more money to burn.The poor refuse to take money from the rich, which makes money worthless towards buying goods or services.Then finally, the rich are free.For once no one will take their money any more, they are also poor.Together, with the mugger who threatened your life, you have saved the world.
