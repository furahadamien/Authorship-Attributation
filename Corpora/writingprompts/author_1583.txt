The first time, it was the bathroom.You see I had wished to be fire proof.I felt the fabric of the universe shift as my wish was granted.I don't know how I knew it was for real.Maybe I was crazy.Maybe I am crazy.When my wish was granted, I went into the bathroom.I grabbed the lighter from my pocket and went to the paper towel despencer.I lit the paper towels on fire next to the sink so that I could easily put it out.Safety first you know.I was mesmerized as the fire clawed it's way through the paper.My nose pricked at the smell of smoke.That was when I realized just how stupid I was being.The next thing I smelled was the burning in my hand.I had dropped the wad of burning paper even before the lance of stabbing pain ripped through my hand.My own burned flesh drew my attention.I was distracted enough running cold water over the burn that didn't notice the fire beginning to spread.After the fire department handled the fire, and the EMT's treated my hand, it was late.I resigned myself to going into work the next day to face the music.It didn't come.For the next week it didn't come.My work suffered as I waited for the other shoe to drop.Eventually, I couldn't take it any more.I confronted my boss."Oh," he said chuckling, "yeah, we knew that was you."My mouth fell open."Are you alright," my boss asked.I couldn't have said anything even if I wanted to."Why don't you take the rest of the day off, come back tomorrow."I did take the rest of the day off.I didn't come in the next day.I thought I had been very politely fired.It was when the pay check came at the end of the month that I finally figured it out.I had wished to be fire proof, and somehow I was, just not in the way I had thought.Currently, I am working about ninety jobs, across three separate countries.The pay checks continue to come in, even though I haven't been to work in the better part of a decade.
