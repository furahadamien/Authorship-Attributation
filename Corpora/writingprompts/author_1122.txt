*Right this way, Mr. Muller*

"Right where?"*Right here, follow my voice*

I'm not sure where I am.My last memory is getting in my car.I must have had an accident.I feel warm, safe and soft.Is this what painkillers feel like?No wonder everyone and their grandmother is addicted to them.*Mr. Muller, you're not in the hospital, you're dead!* said the voice again, slightly amused and mocking this time.*See!*

"But ho..." I asked while opening my eyes.*Works just like it used to, doesn't it?Haha!*

As I first open my eyes everything is bright.If I was still alive it would blind me, it catches me a little off guard.Blinking rapidly I start to make out shelves filled with books.*Welcome to the eternal library*

The voice that talked to me now has a body, a man, not white in color, not brown or yellowish either.He is very well maintained, wearing a perfectly fitting suit; his long, white hair is combed back behind his ears and falls upon his shoulders like the most vivid waterfall.Behind and next to him seemingly endless shelves of books row up; in the one he's leaning on a single book is missing, I assume it's the one he's holding in his hand.Coming to my senses I find myself sitting in a very comfortable armchair.*You already noticed the book, very good, very good.Looks like you're all there.Shall we begin?*

"Wow uhm... who are you?Where exactly am I?Is this heaven?"*Ha, I thought you'd never ask.Heaven, hell, limbo... let's just call it the library.It's the last step before you find peace.And I...I am Angelo.A pleasure to meet you, Richard Muller.*

"Angelo sounds an awful lot like Angel."*Don't you get nosy with me now.Come to me, take your book.*

Slowly I'm starting to become aware again of my body but it doesn't feel like it did while I was alive.I'm able to move my body and feel sensations but there is no strain.The provisional groan I do when standing up proved entirely needless for there is no pain in my back, not a single sting.Two steps later I'm standing in front of Angelo, who holds the brown book towards me in just his right hand.I reach out and grab it, the leather feels soft and smooth under my hands.In golden, beautifully imprinted letters it states "Richard Muller - Allmantown - 791"

"Allmantown, 791... Angelo, this means nothing to me."*It doesn't need to.Start reading.*

The pages were soft like silk, handwritten in redish golden color.Whenever a choice opened up, I had to decide.Turn to page 922, turn to page 508, turn to page 861.Cry for mother or sleep.Page 1810.Kiss Janie Lowenstein.Page 2941.Drink the Schnaps.Page 3229.Get into the car in the morning.Page 6276.Die.Page 6277.I have no idea for how long I've been reading and deciding.It could have been half a day, it could have been months.*Do you remember?*

It's a good question.Do I remember?I remember making the decisions, I remember the content.But do I *remember*?*Let me be more specific, do you remember how you died?*

"Of course I do, I was hit by a car."*And?*

I'm feeling very confident in my answer at first, though after a short moment I'm unsure."Hold on, I wasn't hit by a car, I was in an accident."A tense silence.*And?*

"I fell off a ladder."*And?*

"I was stabbed by my wife"

*And?*

This cycle continued for what felt like an eternity.No matter how many visions of my own death I revisited, there are always more."Why do I see myself dying in these horrible ways?"*I'm not torturing you, Richard.Look around.*

My view went up from Angelos face, looking around the room.Richard Streepe - Allmanntown - 792.Rich Mller - Point Allmanntown - 793.Richard Muller - Allermannstown - 794.*You are not the only Richard.You are just the first one to die.Their life is in your hands.*

Angelo grabs the book next to the one he originally handed me and gives it to me.The first few pages are already written, including possible choices up until that point."This book is almost empty, what am I supposed to do with this?"He steps over to me, reaches into his pocket and gives me a fancy pen.*It won't be for long.I have an appointment with the first Rebecca Stoner from Cornwall, I'll talk to you later.*

Before disappearing through the shelves he adds, smiling:

*Don't worry though, pens are tax deductible for guardian angels.Welcome to your library*
