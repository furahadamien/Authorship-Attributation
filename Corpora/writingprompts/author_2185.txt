DEREK!!! your mother shrieks at the top of her lungs as she marches down the stairs, What is this bag that I found in your room!?!?  She is waving the bag you received from Joey two weeks ago in your direction.What do you do? Slursh the Goblin King peeks over his screen at the black cloaked figure seated to his left.Toran the Necromancer studies his player sheet for a moment before confidently announcing, I use my deception skills to bluff.
     Slursh pauses a moment before he rolls the dice and looks over his notes, Okay so she rolls a 11 and with her +2 quick Google search knowledge modifier and her +3 mothers intuition modifier, compared to your +2 charisma modifier and eldest son +1 conversation bonus means that you will need to roll at least a-
     Critical Hit! Toran shouts as he leaps from his chair, displaying a surprising amount of energy for a human man who has lived for a few centuries.Toran retakes his seat and clears his throat as he shifts into roleplaying, Oh Mom, I see that you found the special oregano I got you for tonights dinner.Joey from down the street says that it is guaranteed to improve the taste of any lasagna a thousand times better.
	She smiles as she thanks you for your thoughtfulness and walks towards the kitchen, Slursh groans as he stares at the pages of hand-written notes he had prepared for this encounter, made utterly useless by Torans insane luck when it comes to making saving throws.Then he inhales sharply as full realization of what Toran has done dawns on him.Words start to tumble out of his mouth while jumps up so he can grab one of the handbooks he had been using as a booster seat until this point.Do you realize what youve done? he shouts as he flips through the pages, Because you told her its oregano, extra-tasty oregano at that, for lasagna, that means that she will definitely use it for tonights visit by your step-fathers parents.This means that every bite will add he pauses as he consults a page of S&Ss Advanced Guide to Meals and Dinner Parties, -a status effect of moderate intoxication (THC).
	Slursh almost drops the book as he struggles to hold back tears.His hours and hours of careful party planning, filled with backhanded complements from the in-laws and mothers subtle retorts referring to their advanced age.The eventual breaking point between the adult NPCs would then lead to a new campaign of family turmoil as the family struggles come together and ultimately end up stronger for it.Now the dinner party will just spiral into giggles and slurred, but somewhat enlightening yet also incredibly stupid statements.You Son of A Troll, the enormous, muscle-bound man seated across from Toran grumbles, You knew I was going dinner tonight to announce that Cynthia has now started dating Lance to the parents and now youve ruined it.
	Oh please, Toran spits out his reply, You and I both know she is just trying to use the fact that she is dating Dereks best friend to draw attention to herself because she feels jealous of her new mother.
 	How DARE you, she LOVES him, Korg the Barbarian roars.Gloriana the Elf, who is currently seated at the end of the table, winces slightly as Korgs words and pitch mirror a conversation she had with her father a few centuries before concerning a rather dashing human rogue.She quickly buries her memories lest her embarrassment start to show on her face.The jackals at this table will never let it go if they think that have something to tease her with.She decides to distract them and regally states: As much as I love it when Korg channels his inner 14-year-old girl, can we please move along.My character needs to finish his math homework so he can go upstairs and pwn some noobs online.Evan is almost ready to prestige which will increase his reputation by 250 points within his social circle. 
	Slursh takes one last look at his carefully written out dinner scenario before he shrugs and places it to the side.Good Suburb Masters can improvise, and Slursh is the best SM around.Okay, Evan is at the table doing math homework.Gloriana, I need you to roll for
