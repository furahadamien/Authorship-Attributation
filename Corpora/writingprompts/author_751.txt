It's time to get out of here.There's nothing left now.As always change isn't an easy thing.Well, I guess it isn't easy because I haven't known anything else.When the men came I was so excited.It's always fun to see new faces.Oh, the smells that come along with a new person!I sat at the window watching as they walked up to the door.If I wasn't stuck in the front room I would have run straight up to them to say hi.I would have wanted so bad to jump up on them but I've been told I shouldn't do that.That really sucks because I like getting close to people.If I wasn't stuck in the front room I might have been able to do something.He walked out with the men and he got in the back of the car they came in.He didn't look happy.He turned around and looked at me through the back window as they drove off.I don't know how long it is now that I've been alone.Too long.Now's my chance to leave though.I recognised the smell of the man in the suit right away.I didn't really like him.When I'd seen him before he never wanted to pet me.He tried not to look at me.He's come into the house and I can hear him in the kitchen.Maybe he's getting me some food.It doesn't matter.I want to leave.I have to leave.He's opened the door and just standing there looking at me.I want to run but he's blocking the door.It's felt like forever.He's turned around and gone up stairs.I look around the room one last time and breathe in deep.One last big smell.There's no need to run.I take my time as I walk out.Normally we go to the right.that's where the park is.Today though...I go left.
