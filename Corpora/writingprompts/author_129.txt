It is Wednesday night at 7 pm.I am sitting at my usual table eating the best steak in town while waiting on the performers.I am so rich that I can probably make anyone a prostitute, so I make sure to lay a lot on the performers.It is I who buy them new expensive clothes for every week and I pay for the first class meal as well.It had now gone about two months of the same procedure, every week at the same restaurant at the same time and with the same people.I never got what their names were, but it doesn't matter anyway.It's just so funny listening to those two rags trying to be professional.It is like watching a one-legged man dance and thinks that he dances like Rudolf Nureyev.And the best of it is that I am in control and can change the scenario however I want.They are now sitting at the table in front of me, talking their usual bullshit.This is probably their highlight of the week.To just for one night per week escape their fucked up reality and be someone else.It is my highlight of the week as well.There they are.In their fancy clothes, in a fancy restaurant, believing that they are making the earth a better place.They think that without this meeting the stocks will crash or that without them the bank would be ruined.They live with the illusion that they are important.I stopped listening to their jibberish and looked around the restaurant and then myself.I noticed that they were not the only two.
