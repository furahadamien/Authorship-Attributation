I stare at the book for a few seconds.Pondering all the what ifs and could have beens.... And then I toss it over my shoulder.They don't matter.I made my choices in life the best I could given the situations that were in my control.I'll never get a do over, so none of it matters.I've made my bed.Now I plan to sleep in it.
