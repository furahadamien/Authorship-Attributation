My parents had been so happy when I finally popped out.The pregnancy had been complicated to say the least.The umbilical cord had gotten wrapped around my neck at 6 months but I'd managed to twist myself free of it somehow.Since then it had just been a seemingly never-ending string of hospital visits, but well, I was a fighter and was still here.Now it was New Years Eve, 2019 and my mom was trying to win a contest for a lifetime of free healthcare by making me the first baby to be born in the state of Ohio in 2020.So when they saw me smiling up at them, looking perfectly healthy it was like 9 months of stress just melted off.The doctor took my measurements: male, 7 pounds 7 ounces, head circumference 14 inches, time of birth 12:01 am January 1st, 2020, and luck 100.My parents were elated.There were hugs and whoops and some tears.They had always known of course.How else could I have survived all those complications.They were still hugging when the doctor softly cleared his throat."Sorry," he said, "I'm not sure if you understood.Per US Code Title 15, Chapter 6, Subchapter I 206 all American hospitals switched to the metric luck scale starting in 2020.As you know, metric luck is precisely the opposite of imperial luck.Your son, unfortunately, is incredibly unlucky"

My parents were speechless for a moment, but only a moment."But the complications, he survived them all!"my dad yelled."And the free health care he's entitled to, he won that, that's lucky!"my mom screamed."There must be some mistake!""No mistake ma'am," the doctor calmly replied.He had seen it all in his time here, after all he was only a 25 imperial luck, which was probably why he was stuck doing this stupid New Years Eve shift in the first place, though you could never be sure."I don't know how it could be any clearer that your son has terrible luck.Look at all those complications he barely survived!Why, the chances of having all those problems must be astronomical.And well, you are correct about the free health-care, but as you know the most unlucky people have to be sent to prison to keep them from accidentally doing something horrible - you know we're still rebuilding Cincinnati after that idiot sunk the business district  - and if you read the contract you'll see that since all prisoners have free healthcare we technically will be fulfilling the terms of the agreement.I must apologize, but you have to understand, it simply wouldn't be safe for you to try to raise him in your own home."My parents did understand.People had tried to fight it and it had always ended up terrible for everyone, why would I be any different?
