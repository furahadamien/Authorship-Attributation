Some day, youll learn, as the Ghoosha did, that 90% of WP is based on formulaic pseudo-prompts that are more likely to make you a worse writer than a better one.

But surely today is not that day?

Yes, we will continue posting terrible prompts.Why would anyone ever want to be a writer?What a stupid pursuit.Let us continue to manually pleasure each other.

You are the president of a society with only feet, one day you meet a person with hands...

Oh yes, this will go right to the front page!Excelsior!

Wait till you hear the one about being born with one very specific unrealistic plot device, that one day ironically interacts with another random facet of an improbable world!Totally different than this one, obviously.

Genius... Just genius... buy the book rights before someone else nabs em!

You live and a world without publishing, and have just written the first book...

My god, youre unstoppable.
