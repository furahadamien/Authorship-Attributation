Christ, it never got easier.Well, it did... in the same way that you'll pick up riding a bike, I managed to make it quick and painless, for the most part.The hard part was the aftermath.They all wore smiles, in their death throes, and the echoes of wisdom in my head told me what I was doing was the right thing.Of course, the authorities assumed it was something I'd drugged them with, or some bizarre case of rigormortis.My first victim was a cat.A stray, mangy creature that was on death's door when it crossed my threshold.The blade called to me, and it seemed to thrum in my hand gently as I looked at the cat.I don't remember what happened after that.But I remember, I remember a... a purr.I didn't leave the house for three days.I lost my job.The blade called to me again.My previous manager, Azelia, was surprised to see me at her house that evening.She welcomed me in, offering me coffee before I slid the blade between her ribs.This time, I remembered, and felt, EVERYTHING.The blade effortlessly bypassed the ribs, piercing her lung, causing a surprised gasp to come out as a quiet gurgle.I felt the surgical, instinctive twitch that severed her heart from her brain.She went quickly.No witnesses.No kids, no partner, thank fuck.When I withdrew the blade, it was clean.The faint red stain below the incision (which is what I always called it, from that point) reminded me of those Catholic images of Jesus.It struck me that she was like a negative of that image.Disposing of her body traumatised me.The tiny amount of blood made it easier to hide any smell, but she still shat herself.Two bin liners, duct tape, and a mattress in the attic gave me a decent head start.I cried the whole time, but the knife, still in the kitchen, told me that the other side was where people had been given the gift of foresight.No future shock, carbon neutral, and the inherent understanding that to harm a member of your own species was to ultimately degrade the species as a whole.It was an act of love that gave me this job.The cops got in touch with me eventually, but I'd already taken care of four more good people.The ash rained down as they went through their bureaucratic process on my stoop; they had bigger problems than some people being murdered.The knife told me from under my mattress about the nice men visiting me: Officers Robert Blackburn and Jason Smythe.Robert's youngest, Gabby, was just diagnosed with cancer.She'd grow to solve issues of interplanetary economics if she was taken to the other side.Jason had ideas about prison reform here that would make him governor within a decade there.It  made no difference to me.I knew that Kate had to be the next one.She was beautiful.She loved me.And I loved her.And we both loved Tyson.But not Tyson.No.Why not?I asked.The knife went silent.It would talk to me about good people.And only good people.It didn't seem thrilled about Kate, but said that she'd make the cut.I thought we'd raised him pretty well?Some things are unavoidable, the knife replied.He'll be made an orphan when this is through.I took Kate out to dinner; deep dish pizza, a real treat.Probably not as good as the old days, but definitely not totally synthetic.We went out to the lake that evening, and watched the sun set through the smoke.I gave her a ring, my mothers.We made love, and lay in each other's arms until we dozed off.I awoke feeling slightly groggy, but the knife had things to do.People to help.I awoke her, and kissed her gently, stroking her auburn hair in the dashboard light.Her eyes widened and watered as I broke her heart.For now, my love.You'll be in a better place shortly.She twisted unnaturally, whimpered, and the blade dragged a jagged gash across her diaphragm.No clean incision here.Her face afterward seemed calm, but not at peace.Not like I'd hoped.Ash drifted in through the car window, and dusted her face.Handbrake off, watch the bubbles stop rising, and I stop thinking that some of those bubbles hold her final breaths.That was years ago.Now I stand in front of a jury of my peers.The knife wasn't able to predict the future.I was going to get caught eventually.I've begged to be put to death with my own blade.It is wielded by another man now.From across the room, Tyson's eyes meet mine.The blade remains silent.It'll only talk to me about good people.
