"Bond, you know his mission may as well be your last, if you're lucky you can make your way to my space Colony.I know MI6 only hires the best."The year was 2018, James Bond and Elon Musk sat in a bright lit meeting room with a grey retro feel to it.What the world renown British Spy was doing in the Nevada Gigafactory was unknown to him up until then."You probably know that conspiracy theory about the lost Cosmonaut in 1959.Well, he never died...to put it politely.Bond, the lost Cosmonaut has been attacking our-our"

Musk was visibly shaken by now."We've heard stories of when the Cosmonaut attacks the space colonies, I'll spare you the details.We lost contact with the ones on the moon.Now we've detected movement during our space colony.Hm?What's that?Yes we've already contacted the *Foundation* and they refused to step in.That's where you're needed, all our other rockets are in use, except for my car.I've made some previously unknown modifications that'll make it space worthy.I'll put it under the guise of a publicity stunt.I'm going to stick you in a spacesuit with a radio, and strap you into one of my cars.Then, whole mankind watches, ill launch you into space.Do remember that this might be your last time on earth.God speed, the colonies are counting on you."**authors note**:I made a little bit of AU with the space colonies and such, also, feel free to give crit (im a terrible writer)
