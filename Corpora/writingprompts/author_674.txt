They all died.Within two years the entire population succumbed due to a unique DNA error, encoded into Gods Powder, the drug that stops aging and was said to elevate humankind to the next level.What was left was us: sick, wrinkled and frail men and women, barely capable of keeping our own failing bodies alive.In a desperate effort to save humankind, old scholars initiated Operation Phoenix.Millions of frozen eggs were fertilized all around the globe and grown in incubators.They could grow children in tubes but they could not raise them faster than nature allowed it.So it was left to us old folks, the Lost Generation, to raise humanitys only hope.The fact that many of us were not even able of wiping our own bums, shows just how desperate we were.Even I got two infants and I am not exactly your number one dad of the month, if you get what I mean.In fact: I never had children of my own.Never wanted any.Now I have two.At the age of ninety six.I managed to hang on until my little boy and girl were eleven, which gave them enough time to learn at least the basics: morals, some critical thinking and an understanding of what love is.Other kids were not so lucky.Many Lost Ones passed away while raising a child, leaving the helpless little creatures to fend for themselves for there was no one else who could take care of them.The elders were dying like they were supposed to.It was hell.The wild instincts of survival drove the children on.The world they formed, was fearsome to behold.I am glad I get to go before I can see what will happen next.I am terrified.Terrified for the future of humankind but most of all I am terrified for my little babies.They deserve better than this.They deserve shelter.Love and compassion.Not starvation, deadly fights over fruits trees, water holes and a warm place to sleep.But this is what they will get.These wild animals, that once may have been humans, were taking over the world.Its the strongest survives in a world full of toddlers and pre\-teens.None of them deserved this.None of them deserved to pay for our mistakes.But they did.

So, whats it gonna be? the tall red skinned devil asked me while he was pouring steaming hot tea from the tiny, gold-rimmed tea cattle like it was an art form.Er What do you mean? I asked not entirely capable of hiding my sweat and fear.We were sitting inside a neat little office.The devil and I.Flower wallpapers sprinkled the white walls with tasteful splashes of color.A white cupboard with delicate porcelain plates and cups stood to on side of us.A little vase with some like summer smelling flowers stood between us.There was lemon cake.Which playpen would you like to go? The devil with the great black horns and loincloth asked again.Playpens, sir? 

Yes.We put the really good dictators into their own little secluded section of hell where they can play tyrant.It really takes a big load of work off our hands, let me tell you that.Someone had the great idea of calling them playpens I myself am not entirely sure, whether that is an appropriate name for hell but I am not gonna complain.As long as it works

So..I am to choose a dictatorship? I asked still very uncertain and frankly, quite put off by the faint smell of cinnamon and burned flesh.Correct, the devil said.He picked up his tiny cup of tea, pinky properly spread while balancing the saucer in his other hand.He blew gingerly on the hot steam.It was grotesque.Every tyrant has their own style.You know, one prefers public execution, the other prefers concentration camps and yet another simply likes to torture his subjects for eternity.Let me tell you, the free time we have down here since we gave them their playpens is just devine! 

Er is there one where we would not get tortured or killed? I asked hopefully.No, darling.This is hell after all and you got here for a good reason hit and run while driving drunk that will surely get you into hell and there is no way back. The tall, horned devil put his cup down and his face became all business like.So! He folded his long fingers in his lap and he looked expectantly at me with his goat eyes.Whats it gonna be?Torture, execution or labor until you die? 

I didnt answer.I found it rather difficult to choose between the options presented to me.Of course, if you are really ambitious, you could simply choose one and work your way up to new dictator.Who knows?If you were to become really good at it, they might even give you your own playpen one day

Splendid I said, sipping uncomfortably on my tea.There was a hint of lemon and pain.
