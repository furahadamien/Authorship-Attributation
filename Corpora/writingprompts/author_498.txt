One time in elementary school, one of my classmates got rushed to the hospital because of a bee sting.She was allergic.I didnt get to watch it happen, because I was inside for indoor option.I was never allowed to go out for recess.I always picked a friend or two, and we played board games while the rest of my class played outside.On the day Sam had her allergic reaction, I remember the other kids all running in late, breathless and excited.So much had happened, and like always, I missed it.As I continued to grow older, I noticed I wasnt like the other kids.My family didnt go to the pool in the summer, I didnt play outdoor sports.We didnt have picnics or go to cookouts.When I was 12, we moved to Vermont.Everything changed.My mom signed me up for snowboarding classes.My restrictions were magically lifted.I was so normal.When I got into college at NC State, my mom resisted.She wanted me to attend somewhere closer to home.I assumed she was just anxious about me growing up and moving away.I didnt think twice about it, until admitted students day.I was walking across campus when a bee landed on my shoulder.Your Majesty, what are your orders? I glanced around.Who had said that?No one was nearby.A second bee buzzed by my ear.Were waiting!  A shrill voice screamed, ATTACK! Suddenly, I was surrounded by a swarm of bees, all stinging at me.Dead bees started dropping around me, left and right, sacrificing themselves to please their queen.I ran, screaming like a child, until someone pulled me inside an academic building.They slammed the door, and helped me fend off the remaining bees.I had my mom pick me up, and she drove me to the airport.There was no way in hell I was going to NC State!I ended up going to my safety school, Kalamazoo, where I could continue my life without being harassed by that crazy swarm of bees.I never figured out how the hell I can understand bees, though.
