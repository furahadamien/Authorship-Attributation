"May you find the peace I couldn't give you."Mark muttered, throwing in a single sunflower in the hole, fluttering down in the dark pit.It landed without making a sound on the strange black box on the bottom."I'm going to miss you so much..." His voice faded as tears overwhelmed him.The sound of rain dripping on the saggy ground was occasionally overtaken by a family member or a stranger Marlinda didn't recognize snorting their nose.*Maybe they all need a blanket and some tea too keep warm?* Marlinda thought, worried about them getting the sniffles.Mom made tea and snugged her in a warm blanket when she was sick and it always made her feel better.Marlinda didn't understand why everyone around her looked so gleam, meeting her family normally filled her with joy, but not this time.Her parents, her grandmother, and all the other faces she had never seen before were crying.And Uncle Mark was the saddest of them all.His eyes were streaming with tears, red and flustered.He looked like a completely different Uncle Mark.Marlinda couldn't remember him doing anything but smile at her -- He never cried.*Maybe it is because he can't find Aunt Alice?* Marlinda thought.Losing at hide and seek made her feel sad too.So she decided to help Uncle Mark, looking around the meadows surrounding them, searching behind the bushes and the trees, hoping to find the smiling face of Aunt Alice somewhere in the park.She always had the most amazing laugh when Marlinda found her.Alice always managed to make her feel happy.To cheer her up no matter how sad she felt.Marlinda was sure she'd be able to cheer Uncle Mark up.*Maybe she is behind one of the stones?* Aunt Alice had to be hiding somewhere; she always loved playing hide and seek with when she came to visit her.She tried to walk away and take a look behind the strange stones.There were so many of them, more than she could ever count."Mommy, I wanna go look for Aunt Alice" Marlinda said, poking her mom in the side to catch her attention."Mommy?Can I go look?"She repeated.Normally Mom would laugh and smile at her, letting her go roam free.But her mom's hand gripped her tight -- too tight -- she was hurting her.Was she mad?She didn't know what she had done wrong to upset Mom so much."Mommy, you're hurting me.""Oh...I'm sorry.What did you say?You want to go look for Aunt Alice?"Mom asked, her voice sounded hoarse."I want to help Uncle Mark find her.He looks so sad.I think it's making him sick.""Oh sweety.It's not like that.Alice is just... She is..." She stopped as if unsure what to say."Marlinda my darling.Alice...isn't hiding.""Then where is she?"Her mom's gaze went to the black box, her eyes were filled with pain and sadness and something else when she looked at it."She's in there" she whispered, nodding to the black box."She's dead, Marlinda.And she's never coming back.""Is that why everyone is sad?"Marlinda asked, suddenly understanding why everyone looked so sick.Yes sweety... We miss her very much."Mom rasped, her voice wavered."Then why doesn't Aunt Alice just come out if it makes you and Uncle Mark so sad?"Marlinda felt confused why Alice would suddenly decide to be dead and lay in the box.It was nothing for her to make people sad.He mom sighed.Shaking her head at her question."I wish she could, sweety, I really wish that she could.But she can't.That's what being dead means.She's gone.""Okay..." Marlinda whispered, still confused about this 'dead'.**A few hours later.**

"Thanks for the tea Hannah, you're amazing."Mark said, his voice was still ragged.Mom, Mark and Marlinda were at home.Mark had gone home with them for a cup of tea which he craddled in his hands.He continued."It was a beautiful ceremony, I'm sure your sister would have loved it.""Anything.Mark.Anything for you."Mom put her arm on his knee."Yeah..." His voice faded."Mommy, what does being dead mean?"Marlinda asked.She'd been thinking about this 'dead' for a while now but it didn't make sense."Where did Aunt Alice go?"Both looked at her with reddened eyes, tears formed anew.Mark face flushed white, smiling wanly.He tried hard to force a smile but failed spectacularly.His sobbing continued as it had done in the car ride home.Mom put her arms around him."Marlinda, go upstairs please.We need to be alone for a moment.""But Mommy-"

"Now Marlinda!"Mom snapped.Marlinda felt shocked to hear the anger in her mom's voice.Instinctively, she backed away, tears welling.The look on her mother's face softened."Go play with your dolls, sweety.""Where do you think Aunt Alice went Mr.Ding?"Marlinda poured him some more tea in his plastic cup.Mr. Ding, the formless plushen doll, had donned a black cape, serious clothing to mirror the seriousness of the situation.Today he was special agent Ding, ready to help solve the case."I don't know Marlinda.But this dead place sure sounds scary!"Agent Ding exclaimed."I guess so.Mom was crying."Marlinda mumbled."But she's mad at me too.She looked upset.Do you think her and Alice had a fight Mr.Woo?"Mr.Woo stared at her with glassy eyes, pondering on Marlinda's question.Contrary to Mr. Dings brazenness, the plastic doll always took his time with coming with an answer; but that made the answers better."I think Mom and Aunt Alice loved each other very much.Marlinda.She wouldn't leave her because of a fight.""But why did she leave to dead?Why did she want to leave us?"Marlinda felt herself crying too, thick tears streaming down her cheek filling the empty cup on the table."I don't think she wanted to."A new voice answered.A real voice.A sweet voice filled with pain."Aunt Alice?"Marlinda perked up and looked right at the face she loved so much.She appeared translucent but was clearly Aunt Alice.She had the same beautiful sun-golden locks which flowed freely embellishing her fine features.Her nose perked up slightly, just the same.Alice's appearance radiated love, but her eyes seemed sad."Hi Marlinda."Alice said, grimacing."Aunt Alice!I've missed you so much!"Marlinda exclaimed."I've missed you too Marlinda.""You came back from dead!Mom said you left us forever!""I'm not really back.I think."Alice turned her translucent hands, studying them."This is so strange.""Do you want some tea?"Marlinda said, picking up the pot."You can have Agent Ding's cup.""Hey, that's my cup!"Ding protested but the cup was snagged away before he could do anything about it.Marlinda started 'pouring'."Listen Marlinda, I'm not sure what's going on but I've got to tell you something.""Oh.Okay."Marlinda stopped midway her pouring tea."Is Mark here?"Alice looked around."He is downstairs.With Mom.""Listen to me Alice.This is very, very important.You need to get him out of here.You need to get him away from your Mom.And you can't tell her about me.""I don't understand.Why not?"Alice picked up the cup and took a sip."Because...she did something...bad.""Mom is bad?"Alice paused, thinking about the question."No Marlinda.Doing bad things doesn't necessarily make people bad.It's why people do bad things that makes them bad -- In your mom's case she did it because of love."She sighed."I guess I understand.""Is it because of Mom that you went to dead?"Marlinda asked.Alice paused, looking at her niece intently as if seeing her now for the first time as a person."Yes... She made me dead.Listen Marlinda, tell him to look under the willow."She started to fade, her body turning glassy with faded colors, but continued."Make sure you tell him!""Aunt Alice.""Yes?"Her voice fleeting."Where are you going now?""I don't know."She sounded scared."Will you think of me?"Alice smiled one last time.It radiated love and peace.Marlinda hugged the sun-like image of her aunt."Always."She whispered.And with that she vanished.The cup fell on the table, ringing silently through the room.Leaving Marlinda completely alone.The screams from downstairs rung through the house.
