Suburbs and Subarus

Suburbs and Subarus

I live the life I choose

Playing Suburbs and Subarus

x2

Krogdar the troll king, with power I wield

A big magic sword and enchanted shield

The field of battle rattles with every victory

But for real this "Seattle" to me is a mystery.For how else can you eat if your Foods are not Whole?Gaining strength without life-or-death fights for your soul?Our lives are so cold and Carol's home has indoor heating

But I can't manage the challenge of PowerPoints for the meeting

Mr Stevens my manager is treating me like I'm dumb

I'm not dumb I would crush him, crush him under my thumb 

Then I had to go and roll a lowly Nat 1

Powerlessness is the essence of what I find so fun

For I can crush your skull and suck the blood from your veins

There's no limit and then with it no surprises remain

Insane though I appear I fear you are mistaken

It's MY time to have the kids, Sheila, don't make me break in!Suburbs and Subarus

Suburbs and Subarus

That's the life I choose

Playing Suburbs and Subarus
