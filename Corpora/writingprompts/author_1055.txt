The red line, it always laid there taunting me.I've spent nights awake thinking of it.I started seeing the lines when I was young, I was around twelve or thirteen, just hitting that wonderful stage of rebellion.I asked my mom about them, she hesitated.She asked what color lines I received.Everyone get different colors, different paths, but you choose on your own and nobody can tell you which is right.As I sit in this office looking down at the people walking below, I know I chosea good path, but did I choose "The Right One"?Sure I have money, a great job, big house, too many cars, but the boredom is killing me.I kept feeling the red line calling me, asking me to try the other side.In the last week the call was becoming louder and the line was darkening.Today it was a deep burgundy.Today I decided to shift from green to red, I stepped towards the red line and as I did the green line went to a bright lime green almost as a warning.I could feel the red line under me with every step I took and watched the green line fade.I continued walking forward and found myself in complete white.No ground below, no sky above.I continued to walk until there was a doorway, I walked through wondering what I got myself into.The room was bright and cheerful, painting of beautiful landscapes on the walls and plush leather couches.The lady at the desk handed me a computer and told me to take a set and handed me a small index card.I read the card
