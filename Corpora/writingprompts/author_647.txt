When the government said they found the magic pill of life, nobody really believed them - just like the other miracle cures that never left the lab.But when the wealthy began using this medicine, I remember the media and the politicians raged about the rich versus the poor.It wasnt soon until the politicians legislated equality of life for all - rich, poor, black, white, latino... you know.Though they had one condition.They said only 26 and under.I was 28.They said there were risks for those who already naturally matured.We knew it was horse shit.The scientists who made the drug said age didnt matter.The president at that time already took the drug.No - the cost of rolling out the treatment to everyone would be too expensive.Thats the real reason and everyone knew it.Though if you really wanted the treatment, live forever, itll cost you $220,000 in Mexico at the time.I didnt have that money.Most people didnt.Some sold there homes for it, I dont blame them.I remember during my fourties, my cousins didnt age a year after 25 while I looked old enough to be their parents.We had the same gym teacher at high school.But there I was...There was also this national crisis at the time... the sex or gender disparity of the population... Something like 57% men and 43% female.Nobody could explain it then, except those anti-life pill activists.They were mostly religious kooks, but I thought they were onto something.There was 1 woman to 7 men.That was about thirty years ago.The government finally halted the treatments and banned it completely.But it was too late.The treatment also affected their children...

My wife just passed away last year.Shes like me, naturally matured.She was 84.She was one of the two million women left in this country.It just occurred to us Americans now.There will be no more America.
