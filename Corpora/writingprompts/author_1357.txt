As Douglas' ship pulled closer to the planet's atmosphere, his onboard computer connected with a local satellite.It began to broadcast the latest galactic news.*The top story lately is that the Galactic Senate declared every planet in our galaxy "identified and assessed for signs of life."All accounts point to humans being the only sentient beings in the galaxy.Efforts will continue, however, into other galaxies as-*  
  
Douglas shut off the news report."So we really are all alone in the galaxy, eh?"He looked down at the planet below him and chuckled to himself."Why not."After surveying the planet for life and finding no signs of intelligent beings, Douglas landed his ship beside a quaint looking lake.The planet itself was not altogether unlike Earth, really.It may someday be the birthplace of another intelligent species, not unlike humans.They would explore their own world, just like we did.They would study their own past, as we have.They would probably search for artifacts of past civilizations and try to understand how great wonders of the ancient world were constructed...  
  
Douglas headed back into his ship and booted up his terraforming software.He loaded the schematic for the Teotihuacan pyramid, aimed his reconstruction beam at the open field beside the lake, and hit "Execute."In minutes, a full-scale, earthen pyramid was towering over him on this deserted planet with no life at all."Let them explain that shit in a million years," Douglas said.Then he got back into his ship and flew off the planet.
