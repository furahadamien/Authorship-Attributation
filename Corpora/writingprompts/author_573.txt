David Kemper woke up as he does every morning at around 6:00 am.He awakes and slumps out of bed reaching for his bath robe.Stumbling out of his room tying the robe around him he eventually makes his way to the kitchen for his ritual coffee and "news paper" reading, which has evolved into reading the headlines on websites like Yahoo, MSN, and the towns local site.David moves a seat a way from the table and props up his laptop so that both are ready for him as he returns from making his coffee.He groggily picks a coffee mug out of the cupboard, sets a k-cup in the Kurig and presses the brew button.Around this time, his son usually gets home from working night shift.Nick was unusually awake given that he normally sleeps during the day, so he decides to shoot the shit and talk a little with his father.David, coffee in hand, returns back to his seat placing the coffee cup on the table and repositioning his laptop.Nick looked at the mug and let out a small chuckle and joked at his dad."World's number 1 dad, hah, yeah right."He said sarcastically knowing full well that his dad knew it was Nick who bought him the mug.David grabbed the mug and turned it in his hands so he could read it himself and let out a smirk as he joked back to his son."Well somebody thinks so."
