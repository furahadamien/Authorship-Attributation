I could smell it again.I tilted my head back slightly and began to count backwards from ten just like doctor Seymour taught me.I got closer to ten and began to try to remember where I placed my Xanax because I could tell this was going to be another bad one.My episodes never fail to flare in October, her birthday.But I could feel my heart begin to throb, perspiration on my face.My nostrils flared and my eyes widened.Since when can I feel her breath on the back of my neck?I couldnt bare not looking behind me for another second.I twisted my head slowly, to make sure the other side of the bed was empty.But what I saw paled in comparison to how much the sound scared me.Her voice was nearly unrecognizable.It sounded low and drowned.She asked me if I found her as my eyes were meeting hers.The shimmering black hair I remembered was now misplaced and disheveled.The whites of her eyes had a bluish tint but they were hardly opened.Her skin was grey but the molded night gown covered most of it.She leaned forward pressing her hands into the bed waiting for an answer.I stammered and jumped to my feet but lost sensation in my legs.Looking up at her from the floor I stuttered trying to scream No.She finished it for me with a smile, No, what?.
