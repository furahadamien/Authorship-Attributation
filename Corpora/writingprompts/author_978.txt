A raucous sound reverberated throughout the sewers.To say that 'It' had woken up would not be entirely grounded in reality.Its consciousness was omnipresent in the sewers It called home, but no threats would ever present themselves that It would deem worthy of investigation.Until now.It knew there were still three more months before It had to next awaken, but It was now here.And It was hungry.# ... #

His own footfalls echoed throughout the sewers around him.There was a rumble deep within the confines of the sewer and Raphael looked above him at the arched ceiling of his home.He sighed and brushed off a rogue spec of shit upon the sight of stalactites of human defecation dropping down all around him.He grunted, pulled his coat up to his neck and hunched his shoulders, and continued walking forward, sloshing his way through the grey water that would plague his feet for the rest of his life.He just wanted to get away from it all: the sewers, his master, his incessantly annoying brothers, even April became a drag for him.So he started to walk.For how long, he couldn't remember.He just started walking because something compelled him to.Looking above he could see manhole covers letting in small streams of light, enough to pave the path ahead of him.There were three paths ahead, straight forward, right, and left.He mulled over the paths that presented themselves to him for a few moments (they were the only interesting thing that happened to him anymore, so he tried to entertain himself as much as he possibly could with the temporary diversions) before deciding to take the right path.'Raph?'He stopped dead in his tracks.'Ralph.Why'd you leave, bro?'Raphael turned around and pushed out his hand in an accusatory point towards his brother, before turning into an open palm pushing away the spectral image that resided ten feet in front of him.They were all dead.All of them.April, Splinter, Mikey, Donny, Leo.All of them.Dead.Or dying.He couldn't tell.His eyes shot open wider than they already had been and focused on the drooping and sagging flesh that fell off of them in bloody bags.He could smell them.Christ.He could /smell/ them.He heard their ragged breath.He heard the creaking of their broken bones.The tired groans each of them exhibited when they moved.They shambles closer to him, calling his name.Panic's grip let go of Raphael's conscience and he turned to run and saw his family again.Closer this time.The smell was stronger.He could see them clearer.Donatello reached out and touched his brother's forearm, leaving behind a black oil mark that slid its way down and dropped to the floor.A sickening hissing sound, and Raphael's arm was alight with a fire, though there was no light.He wiped the acid off of his arm and saw the fair skin he revealed.He looked at the palm of his hand that was now covered in some of the ooze as well and shook it off, only to reveal finger pads.Soft and vulnerable.With a glance of terror, he looked back at his brothers only to see their mouths opened so far that their cheeks tore and revealed the darkest depths of their throats.Black goo sprayed out of their mouths coating his entire body, going in his mouth, securing itself around his midsection.Burning.Stinging.Killing.He screamed, and blindy swung his fist, only to make contact with a cloth-like substance.He wiped his eyes and prepared to swing his other fist, only to see the torso of a man who was seven feet tall.Three orange pom-poms, white frills, blue sleeves.Big red clown shoes.He looked up to see the smiling face of a clown.He almost smiled for a second, until the clown's mouth opened up, revealing row after row of razor sharp teeth.He tried to scream.But by the time that he would have willed his vocal chords into usage, Raphael was no more.Pennywise devoured every last piece of Raphael and savored the taste of pure fear.He'd been so easy to manipulate, it was almost boring.The taste made up for it, he thought to himself.There was an echo of laughter and the soft sound of skateboard wheels on concrete resonating throughout the sewers.It whipped its head toward the sound, entrails running down Its face, blood covering the red plastic smile he kept.It wiped Its mouth, and smiled.Today was a good day to start his hunt.So that was my first story on this sub.I'd love it if you guys could give some constructive criticism on it.King's one of my favorite authors and It is by and far my favorite book, so this was a joy to write.Thanks, all!
