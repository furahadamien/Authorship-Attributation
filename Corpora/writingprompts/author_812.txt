It was just my luck that I had ended up here.First, I died when I overshot a red and got blindsided by a truck.Before I know it, I'm brought before a panel of Angels and Saint Peter himself to be judged.Turns out, I had told six lies too many to qualify me for purgatory, and so I was damned to spend an eternity in Hell.It was a rough start to that week, to say the least.Hell doesn't really do this place justice.I'm told it was pretty bad in the time of the devils by an old soul I met down there after I'd been cast down.Falsely accused his wife of being a witch in the fifteenth century to get rid of her, so he's been there a while.Nice guy, actually, besides the whole wife murder thing.At any rate, during our brief conversation he filled me in on the past few hundred years.Initially, Hell was a city for the fallen angels led by their leader, Beelzebub, and it could cope with the influx of souls they were told to torture by assigning devils to small groups of similar sinners for punishment.However, as thousands turned to millions, and millions to billions, the devils became stretched thin.That's when Beelzebub thought of a brilliant outsourcing method.People such as Genghis Khan and Montezuma were elevated to a semi-devil position, and as time progressed, the worst people of an age were elevated to run such things.Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Nixon, Thatcher- the sky really was the limit.However, things became increasingly fractured as it got out of control from the devils.These groups began working for themselves, some of them all but creating armies of the damned and living like kings.They would take all kinds, and gradually took over areas.It all went to shit when, according to the old man, Beelzebub tried to put a stop to it and restore some power to the devils, and somehow failed so abysmally that all Hell's original Suzerains were either slaughtered or enslaved and kept as power symbols.But the new leaders of Hell never could leave one another alone.Many of them desired control, or just really, really liked violence.And so Hell was cast into civil war.From the Great Khaganate ruled by Genghis Khan and his mongols in the east on the plains of Sheol, to the Thatcherite Empire in the west amonst the hills of Gehenna, Hell was cast into never ending violence.But how does a war work in a place none can die I hear you ask?I hadn't asked, but the old man felt obliged to fill me in.It was a game of numbers and enslavement.No more minions?No more empire.The threat of eternal pain and the possibility of a mediocum of normalcy and comfort were the man things that kept lesser peoples such as myself fighting.Things were bleak to say the least.But he had told me there was a way out.Rumor had it that if you crossed the lakes of fire, and kept heading North through the regions of Hades where its terrible mythological beings plagued travelers, via Abbadon which was home to African warlords and exiles from the other empires of Hell, and up to the cold, arctic northern reaches of Hel where many froze to stay immobile in agonizing pain, there you could be judged again and moved to another afterlife away from this underworld.I had decided it was my best option, and waved goodbye to the old man as I began my journey.I started far south though, in Jahannam, where the great valleys were filled with fire and smoke and where boiling water bled through cracks and dribbled into boiling rivers.It would be a long journey north.(This is the first thing I've ever posted here, I know it isn't great or especially well fleshed out and a bit exposition-y, but I had an hour and wanted to write something.I hope those of you who read it, enjoy it!)
