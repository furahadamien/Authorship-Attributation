"I can't believe that I've found you!"she screamed.Her face was practically glowing, she was so excited.She ran forward and leapt into my arms, and before I could even think to react her voice was resonating in my head."*And don't you even think of dropping me, butterfingers!I remember how you dropped your first girlfriend*."My arms reflexively came up.Just in time too.She collapsed into my arms.Her arms latched around my neck, but she didn't put any effort into keeping herself up."Cori?"I asked.But it couldn't be.The girl in my head wasn't real.I've had schizophrenia since the day I'd been born.Sure, the medicine did nothing to help it, but then again...

"Of course it's me!"she chirped."And no, you're not schizophrenic.Otherwise..." 

"*I would be, too*."And there it was.The voice that responded to my every thought.Smooth and melodic and just a little deeper than average for a girl.The same voice that comforted me when I broke up with my first girlfriend, and helped me with my math homework."Is it... it's really you..." Tears had come to my eyes.I tried to wipe them, but a soft hand and even softer tissue was already dabbing at my face."Yeah," she said.Her voice was softer than the brash and explosive timbre I was used to, but I couldn't fault her on it.This was an emotional time for both of us.Judging from the adorable, wry smile that felt oddly in place on her, I could tell that she agreed.Oh, and judging from the way that she was suddenly interested in anything but me told me that she was blushing from my thoughts."You're a jerk," she whispered.I laughed.She already knew that.She heard my thoughts for the last 37 years."I expected you to be taller."I winced.She knew that would hurt.Then again, I didn't expect her to be this pretty.The blush on her face made me smile.Looks like I'm still the better heckler.God, it was amazing to finally be able to see the reactions on her face.It was also amazing to know that I wasn't crazy.But more than all of that?It was nice to hold a friend.I hugged her tighter, and swore to myself that I would never let her go.I didn't need to read her mind to know that she thought the same.The way her grip on my neck tightened told me enough.
