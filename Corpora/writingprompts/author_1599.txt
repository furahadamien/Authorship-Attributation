"I see."The words - if you could call them that - came out between a cough and sputter, a mixture of a hoarse screech and pained wheezing.Stirring awake with a strange lump in my throat, and the streams of tears flowing down my cheeks, I did what anyone would've done.I sat down, and cried.I mourned for the imaginary me's death, of another life that I dreamed, of the friends and families that I've made.The sensation of wiping the tears from my eyes with such unusually large, almost clumsy hands is strange.It's been decades since I've used them, after all - or so I perceive.Frantically remembering what I've done right before I became me in another realm, I searched frantically for another one of those mushroom.Alas, it was the last of its kind, and I don't have the knowledge of mycology to possibly replicate more of it.Google or Wikipedia would've helped, but such fantastic creations, of having access nearly the entire knowledge of mankind at my fingertips, shall forever remain a ghost of a memory, buried within me.Howling, pounding, cursing, screeching in anger against the unknown force that be that played such a cruel joke upon me, an average being with no notable features, the words form.Crudely, I utter a stream of expletives at my newfound curse of intelligence, and of a life that I've lost, filled with regret.The show of sorrow and anger took hours, and seems to have scared away many other beasts.A particularly large feline seemed to be hungry, but one death glare and a roar later it darted back into the tall grass, even.The other primates that were attracted by the noise were confused and worried, but it's not something that they can truly understand.Slowly, the sorrow and anger died, and came a smile.One of bliss and happiness, of fond memories and a life well spent.Taking the time to recover, pushing side the others to get some water, I slowly recounted my life.There were sad moments, and there were happy moments, but in a way, I've been "isekai (\*1)"'d like one of those Another World novel.I could use my knowledge as a human, and possibly the smartest of all beings, to build society out of those primates, or even make my own legacy here.(\*1: Isekai is Japanese for "Another World", a trend of novel in Japan and China where the main protagonist is transferred to another world, one way or another, and various adventures or misadventures occur.)...But that would be boring, wouldn't it?What good is it to be memorialized forever, if life is merely a hallucination caused by a mushroom trip?In the first place, was I the butterfly or the dreamer?No, if those dreams were real, a prophecy of future to come, then there's only one thing to do.Turning back to the other primates, I began to speak and screech, conversing in broken Primate."My brothers and sisters.I had a vision.A vision where there is lots of water, where fruits grow where we want, where dangers are kept away by the strength of many ones instead of strength of ones of ones.Where we don't worry about going to the smaller hole when a big cat come, because we have came together as many instead of ones."The other primates were suitably confused, but that's fine.For now, they just have to start moving.Once they've started moving, they'll learn to think."I brought from the long dreams a spark of light, from a giant being named Prometheus.It is the wildfire that turned sky red and the grass black."The primates panicked, even as I hummed in a soothing voice, "He brings us a gift, and wish us happiness.He is friend, look."Starting a small campfire (Scouts training really helped) and keeping it contained, the other primates were in fear and awe of a controlled fire that I've made.Sitting the others around the campfire, I started telling them stories and legends from what I can remember, making up the rest where I can't.It earned laughter and tears, or the occasional puzzled stares as I came upon concepts too alien for them to understand, but that's fine.I spoke to them in length of the theft of fire and demonstrated the fire, and of various mythos - Greek, Norse, even Lovecraftian, to capture their attention and get them used to my voice, as my language slowly shifted more and more from primate to a simple form of English.As the collective fancies of the mankind as I remembered them captured the primates, I taught them what I considered the most important lesson of all, between that of powerful beings and heroes."... And the heroes compromised, that they would not take and steal from one another.""But, they strong.Why strong not take?""Because heroes are strong, but big heroes stronger.But big heroes also need to sleep, and sleeping heroes are weak.The heroes agree that they will not hurt each other.""Like tribe?""Like tribe, yes.They promise not to take each other's things, take other's partners, take other's shelters, giving up those...Freedom."I taught the primates what I considered the important aspect of society, law.By illustrating how the heroes in my story gave up the freedom to harm one another, they were able to work together.By making examples of how the primate tribes have certain commonly agreed upon habits, I explained to them the concept of following traditions.By insinuating and manipulating their train of thought, I connived the primates into wondering and dreaming about the benefits of working together in a lawful society, where one do not have to worry about others in the tribe taking advantage of their moments of weakness.From this spark of fire stolen from Prometheus, the OG thief of fire, I gave the others knowledge of cooperation, law, and society.I am not sure if this seed will take hold and sprout, but...The mankind of another me, this is my gift to you, the only gift I know how to give, being the idiot that I am.A seed of wonder and stories, a seed of order and cooperation, an early start on us hopefully being less of an asshole toward one another.If this butterfly dreamer's wings beat and caused enough of a storm in your future, that you could have less pain and suffering, that's all I, and the other I, could've ever asked for.
