Ian lazily threw off the blanket and slammed his hand down on the incessant alarm clock.He glanced at the flashing numbers that reminded him of what he already knew.It's 6 o'clock and time to start the day.He sat up, rubbed his eyes, and cast them in the direction of the sleeping figure next to him.Ian knew he was a lucky man, but waking up next to his beautiful wife Emma every day made him feel even luckier.Not to mention the two sleeping children in the room next to his that were his pride and joy, his greatest accomplishment in life.Nothing could ruin the way he felt in this moment.Ian made his way downstairs, careful not to wake the three sleeping beauties in the room upstairs.He began his morning routine by pressing start on the coffee.He then stood in front of the kitchen window and peered out at the vast rolling hills eluding to the most incredible sunrise.In that second, he knew life couldn't get any better.Suddenly, Ian heard a gurgle out of the coffee pot and knew his caffeine drip was ready.He opened the kitchen cupboard grasping for his favorite mug.Emma, Tyler and Isaac had gotten it for him last year for Father's Day and the mug proudly declared the he was the #1 Dad...So he thought.As Ian began to pour his coffee, he noticed something unusual about his prized mug.It no longer declared him #1 Dad, in fact, it declared him #59836 Dad.Ian knew he wasn't the best dad, but dammit he loved his children and would do anything for them.The realization that there were 59,835 father's that were better than him made his heart hurt in an unimaginable way.He thought someone was playing a sick joke on him.He took pride in his capabilities as a father.He loved his kids and they were his reason for always trying to be better than he was.He felt a hand touch his shoulder and knew his wife Emma was awake.He turned around slowly to look at her and she knew instantly that something was wrong."What's wrong, honey?"She said softly.Ian picked up the mug and showed it to Emma and suddenly his sour mood made sense."59,836" Ian muttered with disdain in his voice

"Oh, honey."Emma said at a loss for words."Yesterday, I was #1 Dad and today I'm #59,836"

Ian slammed the coffee mug down hard enough to make Emma flinch but soft enough as to not break it.That number kept echoing in his head like a record stuck on repeat.Ian ignored Emma as he made his way upstairs to the room where his kids slept and stared blankly at two of the most important things in his life.He was still fixated on that number.Ian finished his morning routine, kissed his wife and children good bye and left for work.Snaking through traffic, Ian's mind was racing, he couldn't understand what was going on.Ian was a problem solver and this was one problem he couldn't get a grasp on.He was ashamed of his ranking.*Does it really matter what my rank is?I take care of my children and I love them more than anything on this planet.* He thought to himself with an ache in his heart.Ian pulled up to his office and slammed the car door behind him.He was moving, but it didn't feel like it.He grasped for the door slowly pulling it open, as he recalled how happy he felt this morning.He thought nothing could ruin his mood, but here he was, not even two hours later, walking through the entrance of his office building with a heavy heart.He made his way to his corner office and slumped down in his black leather, executive-style chair.He opened up his laptop and it flashed awake with pictures of his two boys and his wife from a camping trip they took just last year.For the first time, since he saw that damn coffee mug, he smiled.Finally it dawned on Ian and he knew what he had to do.Admittedly, he was a workaholic, but he also wanted to make sure his wife and kids never went without.He's now realizing that he's been too worried about fortune and success than being the father that his kids needed.He was a pretty damn good father but he also knew there was room for improvement.He shut his computer off and strolled out of the office with a plan.This was the most hopeful he's felt all day, and he was gonna seize this moment."Mr. Callapari!Where are you going?I need to speak with you!"John yelled as Ian was making a fastidious attempt to leave the building."Yes, John?Make it quick, I've got to be somewhere."Ian said with irritation

"As you know, I have a little baby girl at home.This morning, I went to drink a cup coffee before coming and ever since I haven't been thinking straight.My #1 Dad mug now says #35674."John said.Ian felt a pang of jealousy rip through his heart when he found out his junior associate was a better father than him.He could feel the hurt coursing through every inch of his body."What the hell is your point?!"Ian snapped."Umm, I- I- was wondering if you knew what was going on.Why did my mug change and why do I feel like such a terrible father?"John stammered in an embarrassed fashion but was totally at a loss for words beyond that."I don't know what's going on, but, that's why I'm leaving."Ian declared

"You got one too?"John ask with a tiny bit of hope in his voice."Yes, I did."Ian said coldly."What did your mug say?"John asked curiously."#1263" Ian said straight faced.*A damn lie.* Ian thought to himself *A damn lie.*

John's face fell flat and Ian couldn't help but feel a little guilty for telling the man that trusted him, a blatant lie.He didn't want anyone to know the truth.Not his real ranking.No way.John slumped and walked away.Ian stood there a bit confused because the look on John's face made it seem like he had more to say, but Ian wasn't in the mood to pry the answers out.Not now, not today.Ian breezed out of his office building and back to his car.He jumped in, put the key in the ignition, started the car and drove off back home, where his wife and kids were playing.The kids were out of school for the summer and since Emma was a teacher, she too had the summer off.He turned down his street and could finally see his house.He turned into the driveway, put the car in park and turned it off.Ian stepped out of the car and into the house where his boys were playing.Little Tyler ran up to him and wrapped his little arms around his legs."Daddyy!!!You're home!"Tyler screamed excitedly.Ian picked up Tyler and Tyler wrapped his arms around his neck and laid his head down on his shoulder.*This.This right here is everything* Ian thought warmly to himself.Ian set Tyler down and made his way towards his home office.He sat down in his chair and began to type out an email.*To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing a formal letter to inform everyone at the company that beyond this day, I will no longer be an employee of this company.I have neglected my wife and my kids in an attempt to find success.But this morning something woke me up and I now realize that I've been on wrong path and it's time to change that.My kids need a full time father.I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.Sincerely,
Ian Callapari*

Ian shut the computer off and went to find his wife.He felt happy for the first time in a long time.They have money saved up and he knew they would be okay."Honey!"Ian bellowed in an attempt to get Emma's attention.Emma stood up and walked over to Ian, and she could feel that he had something up his sleeve.His behavior had been quite erratic since the mug incident."Honey.We're moving."Ian declared authoritatively

"We're what?"Emma asked with shock in her voice.**--------------------------**

**5 years later"**

Emma snuggled up next to Ian and reflected on all the changes over the past few years.They moved out of their giant house into a wood cabin out in the middle of the forest.It was quiet save for the movie playing on the T.V.Isaac and Tyler sat on the other couch, and Emma couldnt help but smile; she adored her two boys and all the changes Ian has made have been unbelievable.Ian felt Emma smile against his chest and glanced at the mug that rested on the mantel above the fireplace.The mug read "#1 Dad".Ian smiled, closed his eyes, and drifted off to sleep.-----------------
