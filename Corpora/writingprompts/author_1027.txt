"Do you think Bob will find us here?"Rory whispers, "Well, he always does, but I think we're safe no.."
"OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR SCOTT!OR SO HELP ME GOD I WILL SHOVE THIS WHOLE SLEEVE OF OREOS DOWN YOUR GOD DAMN THROAT!"The pounding at the door is relentless, all the while Scott and Rorys hearts pounded much faster and louder.It had been 3 months since they had last seen Bob, the man who had sworn an oath to deliver a fresh case of oreos to Scott monthly.These deliveries had been going on for 38 years, and the two boys couldnt stomach eating one more oreo."Stay here Rory and be as quiet as you can, I'm going to find us a way out."softly spoken by Scott as he tip toes through the house to find an exit."I've been dodging this guy for 3 months and he actually caught me this time.I dont want anymore fucking oreos, I've never even liked them.Why won't he just go away?"thoughts flying a million miles an hour through Scott's head."SCOTT I SEE YOU IN THE WINDOW!OPEN THE DAMN DOOR!"Bob screams "I SWORE I WOULD BRING YOU OREOS EVERY MONTH AND I'M A MAN OF MY WORD!"he continues.Scott, caught and afraid of what may come, rebuttals "Bob... it's not your cookies, it's me, I just, I, I just don't want anymore oreos."The pounding stops."I never stopped loving your cookies, but I...." Scott tries to get all his words out but gets cut off."You're eating Waf
fers now arent you?"Bob asks in disgust."No!Of course not!"Proclaims Scott."Liar!On my last delivery I could smell the vanilla on your breath and see the crumbs under your nails!"pours out Bob's mouth like the tears in his eyes."Pssssst.Scott.If he knows I'm here he will kill us both!"Rory quietly blurts out."What would make him do that?"Scott replies.Rory proceeds to point to his shirt pocket emblem that reads "Wafer Cookie INC." then points out the back window to his delivery van.Suddenly a rock flies through the window on the front door, an arm pokes through the broken glass hole and unlocks the door."I saw the van outside, how could you?I've always, ALWAYS BEEN LOYAL TO YOU SCOTT!"with a beet red face and a waterfall in each eye, Bob continues "I thought what we had was real..." he drops the case of oreos and lifts his shirt to reveal a gun.Time stood still as he pulled it from his waist and put his finger on the trigger.TBC.
