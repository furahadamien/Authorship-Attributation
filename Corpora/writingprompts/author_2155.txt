"I don't have time for this Hydro, so let that girl go and I may just spare you the hurt."His voice boomed.Mr. Streak, greatest hero of the 1980s, my grandfather's one time nemesis and comrade in arms against the Zorblaxian invasion.Despite his age, the old dreg still looks dapper as he was in his prime, it's a pity this old clock is falling apart beneath that fresh varnish."You have to actually stop me first, Streak."I taunted, smirking at him.True to his name, Streak flew at me like a blur of mass, his signature blue lightning trailing behind.His left uppercut lands square on my jaw.I let go of the mannequin and back-flipped into recovery as Pappi had taught me, not that the old slug could hurt me at his current level but otherwise the illusion would be broken.Screaming for a full second to get his attention, I then launch a controlled water jet giving him just enough time to evade.Hardest part of the job, trying to kill an old man without actually killing him.A bolt of blue lightning with enough power to light the city comes crashing down on me, with barely enough time to condense the surrounding vapour into a bubble shield.I fought back the impulse to retaliate with lethal force and do a countdown to when he would drain himself.At the stroke of zero, I dropped to a half kneel as part of the act, but mostly because I can't stop my legs from trembling.Gosh, babysitting this old fogey is a high-stress job."Your powers have grown again, Streak.But I'm not done with you yet."I stood up in stance, still somewhat shaky, but I can't leave too early lest Streak throws himself between Morganna and the Force-X.He nearly got himself killed last time.Streak responds in kind and throws the first punch.What was the expression again?Float like a butterfly, Stink like a soiled diaper?Yes, my dear Streak has soiled his diaper.I pray for the all clear to come before his spouts of lucidity comes back, hate to see the old squirt embarrassed in public.God must be listening, because right as his next strike was about to land, the telepathic channel buzzed to life with Psych's voice calling for retreat.On hindsight, I think she's the one listening, not god.Psych, you still there?How about that date?"I'll get you next time, Streak, until then..." I turn tail, running into the portal.EDITED 15/04/17
