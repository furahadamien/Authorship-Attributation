Going far enough towards either extreme, many often find that the two poles resemble each other far more than they do anything more moderate.Reality appears like a horseshoe in this way, twisting impossibly to draw concepts into a singular grip.In this mindset, consider an extremely lucky person.When I was born, I got stuck in the womb, and they had to break my collarbone to get me out.In this process they found I had a rare but fixable deformation in my collarbone that they would have had to break anyways to treat.When I was young I fell out of a tree and bruised my entire right side, just before a satellite dish blown by a windstorm tore through the branches I'd been in.The day I got my first car, I got t-boned in an intersection, just moments before the car I'd been following behind was blown apart in a freak accident.The last straw, it seems, was when my most recent application for a job got denied, and on what would have been my orientation day, a deadly gas leak sprung in the building.When they came to my door, they were in hazmat suits with riot shields.They were polite but firm as they brought me into an armored car, my family following along in concern both for me and themselves.As we drove away, a giant tree fell on the house, crushing where my bedroom had been.I was told on the way that I was being taken to a place where my luck wouldn't affect those around me, a place where others with my extreme circumstance were kept.They very obviously avoided words like "prison," "containment," or "optional."Part of me was relieved, despite my apprehension.Maybe I could finally stop looking over my shoulder and waiting for my good fortune to strike again.It's been years since then.The place where people like me are held is very hospitable, but the man behind the curtain shows if you know where to look.Guards wear riot armor, walls are both reinforced and padded, nothing is kept in high places.The facility has weathered natural disasters one after another in which miraculously nobody is hurt and the sorrounding wildlife experiences a boom in resources.Walls have fallen in the exact way so as not to hurt anybody, exposing key infrastructure failings that would have gotten worse over time.Food poisoning has prevented us from going outside on the day a meteor struck the outer wall, showering anybody not inside in deadly debris.This place is both impossible and dreadfully sensible, full of the most unlucky lucky people in the nation.As I try to sleep some nights and think about the outside world, I find myself emphasizing with the disaster Pokemon; always where misfortune strikes but never responsible, never the one hurt but always the one feared.I suppose that's just my luck.
