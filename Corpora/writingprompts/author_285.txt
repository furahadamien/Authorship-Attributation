TheRobertFall
There was something about her stare that caught me.It wasn't the green of her irises nor the deep black of her neverending lashes.It was the curvature underneath her eyes every time she smiled, and the glint in her pupils shining like a shooting star in a cold winter night.I had never witnessed beauty in such purity, not even in my best shapes.See, she had inner beauty.Every gesture of her was a mirror of the warmth in her soul, of its kindness.Something no shapeshifter can't imitate.I wanted her.And I wouldn't give up no matter the rejections or the many shatters in my heart.Nothing mattered but her.Or so I thought.Three years it took me to understand her taste.She liked them shy and handsome, pensive and profound.I remember the day I conquered her for the first time, the nerves I felt crawling across my chest, the shape I took.Everything.But it didn't work out.She freaked out when she saw... well let's not talk about what I hide in my basement, it's not there anymore or I should say *they* are not there anymore.We shapeshifters can be quite disgusting to the unknowledgeable.The second time was much easier yet the nerves were still there, blooming like a rose in late spring.I got her to dine with me in a fancy restaurant.She wore a dress of intense red, it sculpted her figure tightly... what a masterpiece she was.I, of course, wore another suit: a short man with a chiseled jaw.I pretended to be an engineer but the lie merely got so far.Let's just say that before the desserts, the only thing of intense red in our table was my face with her hand plastered on it.Goddamned rings.They hurt.Now, I managed to get a third date.I didn't shapeshift this time, my basement is empty and there are no lies in the table.But there's is a gun in my kitchen.I can't deal with the grief of losing her, I thought I could but I cant.I knew the risks of a woman like this and I accepted them with no complains.But there's a truth I refused to believe.It was clear from the beginning, bright as the sun... as her eyes.She's pure of soul and I'm rotten inside.We were never supposed to be.

"Ah, isn't the scent of peace wonderful," I said as I stood in front of my open window.The sunrays imbued me with their tender heat, it reminded me of a hug brimming with love.I went to the kitchen, stretching as I walked down the stairs.The scent of freshly made hotcakes swirled into my nostrils, drawing a smile on my face.I felt *good.* Everything was alright."Honey, someone left a box for you.It's on the table," my wife said, carrying the pile of hotcakes toward the table.When we crossed paths, she kissed me.How did I manage to find such a lovely woman?I still don't have the slightest clue."A box?Wonder what it contains," I said, rubbing my chin."Maybe is an enormous letter!Or maybe is an evil plan from one of my foes."I bolted and opened it.It had no sender, just my name wrote clumsily in a white label.A weird feeling of confusion swarmed my insides when I saw that there were two old and torn newspapers.*1985 and 1986 that's like... yes, old,* I thought and set my eyes on the front cover.**1985**

*Dr. Mindwiper is plunging the word into chaos by inserting fake memories in the minds of heroes.He's unstoppable and the fate of society seems to be heading his waytowards destruction.Only one heroine remains, Kissladan yet she's nowhere to be seen.*

*Are we doomed?Is this the end of everything as we know it?*

**1986**

*Dr. Mindwiper dictatorship came to an end.Kissladan turned him to the good side, the side of peace and prosperity.Using her signature move, the Kiss of Kissladan she reprogrammed Dr. Mindwiper's brain completely.As long as the effect doesn't wear off, society is saved.*

---------------------------------

*I'm Dr. Mindwiper,* I thought and squinted, eyes set on my wife.*Did she?It can't be, is she Kissladan?*

"What's wrong honey?"she said and sat in front of me.Her blue eyes drowned into mine and I blushed like a child.I set the newspaper aside, I was happy."Nothing sweetie, just a bad prank."

I roamed the scorched, torn apart streets.The vestiges of what once were great buildings lay scattered in the path.The silence, which I used to find comforting, now made my bones quiver.I missed the bustle of the crowds, and their awful jokes.I missed the smell of food, and the fresh scent of spring.I missed their tales, and I missed so much more.So far, I had found a single family alive.I hadn't searched too much, for I had focused my efforts on taking them to safety.They called me Life, and it suited me.They couldn't see me, nor hear me, but I had guided them with a path of stones to a cave in the mountains, where I left them with enough food for two weeks.Then, I came back to the city, seeking for life.Six days had gone by, and all I had found was wreckage, dry blood, and the thick reek of radioactivity.There had to be more survivors.I had heard the rattling of those weirds creatures hunting.I sighed, and sat atop a pile of broken boulders.The night was deep, and the moon shied away behind thunderclouds.Something tugged the back my robe.It must have gotten trapped inside a crack.It happened a lot, for it loved to billow.I pulled it free, without success.I turned.A woman stood there.Her skin was jaundiced and she had no hair.Her jowls were sunken, and her extremities were extremely thin."Help me," she said.Her voice was soft and fragile.I froze in place.She could see me?How?She was still alive.I couldn't taste her soul.I placed my scythe atop her head, and it shimmered iridescent.The countless colors bathed her in a gleaming shower of light, and once it faded, her skin had recovered her natural tone, pale-white."Is there anyone else contaminated?"I asked.She shook her head."How did you survive alone for so long?""I don't know," she said, mouth quivering."I don't know what is happening.I-I just woke up.Am I dead?That didn't make any sense.Had she been asleep for an entire year?Why didn't the radioactivity kill her?"No, you are not.Follow me," I said."I will take you with the others."The rattling of approaching steps resounded in the distance.The creatures were coming.----------------------------------------------------------

It was dusk and Tornnus, son of the fire, was hammering the searing steel into a knife.He needed it urgently as the night before he had lost his somewhere between countless beers, ales and songs.His sturdy, soot-covered hands were trembling due to the abstinence and he couldn't quite spot when was the last time he had been sober at this time of the day.But he knew very well that the knife was a matter of life and death.He didn't dare to look downwards where his long, braided and ginger beard rested.He felt heretic and dirty inside.He could feel those rioting hairs pricking against his chest, dishonoring their ancient culture.A culture which condemned those whose beards weren't immaculate.He had to cut them off.Otherwise, he couldn't leave his forge which meant no alcohol, which meant betraying his kind.The night fell and the tender red of his forge and crucible tinged his gloom smithy.Tornnus sat on a chair which creaked for his life, fidgeting as he gazed, unblinking, towards his iron table where the boiling knife rested.He cursed under his breath, for he had forgotten to fill his slack tub with cold water.Hours had passed and the knife remained the same, strange thoughts wandered across Tornnus' mind.Could he risk ruining his beard using the knife as it was?The answer was a resounding negative.He felt caged and claustrophobic, his bloated skin was dry begging for the holy ichor to feed his veins.What could he possibly do?A not so deranged idea crossed his mind, removing the insurgent hairs with his bare hands.But it faded into forgetfulness once his eyes met the mess of grease and soot that he called hands.Tornnus took a deep breath and stared downwards to properly assess the chaos.He fainted after witnessing stains of soot impregnated on his beard, dulling its usual brightness and hiding its fiery red.If only he had remembered to fill some buckets with water, this would have never happened.His black eyes shot open at the booming noise of fists stomping his oak door.Daylight seeped through the crevasses of his dry stone walls.How long did he lay unconscious?His lips were shattered, his beard disturbed by various dirty enemies yet Tornnus wasn't worried about that anymore."I'm sleeping you bastards!I will open in two hours," he yelled and the noise stopped.Tornnus examined the knife, strangely he remembered everything that had happened the day before.Was he enchanted?What was this witchcraft?He almost bolted out the room to seek for Muradain's blessing, he needed answers, his brain felt overwhelmed yet relaxed by the memories.He had never felt so good in his life.Tornnus was torn between two conjectures.If a dwarf stains his beard, then he's granted the power of memory by other forcers, was the first one.The other one was simply that Alcohol was a mind wiper in disguise.He felt a shiver crawling up his legs, both of these ideas defied his beliefs.But he was going to test them.He waited for the duskwhen all the dwarves went to the inns or stayed at their homes drinking beerto fall and left his smithy to seek some water.The dwarves that still roamed the streets cursed at him, some even defied him to a duel for his honor but Tornnus ignored them all.He simply filled some buckets with water and brought them back to his smithy, where he cut, cleaned and perfected his beard.The next morning, he remembered everything with unbelievable clarity.His beard was immaculate, so it had to be the alcohol.With his chest high he sought for those who defied and cursed at him the night before.He found them smiling and claiming that they didn't remember doing such a thing.Tornnus' discovery could've changed the beliefs of his people but, like a proper dwarf, he said nothing and went to get some beer and ale.--------------------------------------

Lily always had a thing for mischief.In high school she would hide under that sly smile of hers, watching the innocent get blamed for her carefully planned antics.She was a ghost amidst the currents of students.But, if you were fortunate enough to spot her doodling alone in the corners, you would be hopping from graveyards to haunted houses.We fell in stupid love together.Soon, I became her partner in crime.I still remember Danny Dunning's tears when old teacher Senchal sent him to detention, convinced that it had been him who released the rodent.It had been twenty years since we broke up.Lily now sat at the other side of the desk.Her relentless beauty had aged like a good scotch; but her silly passion for mischief had turned into a nefarious syndicate of crime -- which she ran."Robert!You look terrible," Lily said and smiled.God, that smile.I smirked, "Coming from you, I take that as a great compliment," I said and chuckled."So, you are running a crime syndicate now?""Yes!Isn't it wonderful?I get to doodle all day and get paid for it.It's just like what we did in high school," she said."Honestly, you would be surprised how similar it is."I drew my lips into a line and flinched slightly, she didn't believe her words, didn't she?"You could say such things, but now you have thugs involved, willing to harm people," I said."That's not quite the same in my opinion."Lily sputtered and raised an eyebrow."Do you think me a fool that can't come up with a plan where no one gets hurt?"I tugged the collar of my shirt and swallowed."I...I trust your abilities, I've been a part of them.But still, it *is* wrong to rob banks and such."She sighed deeply."Listen Rob, we both know why you came here, and we both know it wasn't to pay me a simple visit.""It wasn't?This is news to me."Lily slid a bunch of papers across the desk."Sign them.I missed my partner in crime," she said and smiled her sly smile.Fuck.I grabbed the pen.------------------------------
