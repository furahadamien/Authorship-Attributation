We had stories, every species did.They would be grand.Wise.Gracious.Violent.Wonderful.The story of the First was always a popular topic for fiction, and the occasional hoax, to bewitch the citizens of the federation.We found their eyes first.Ancient, primitive things.More debris than proper probes at this point.Inside were beautiful things.Art, science, mathematical principles.Signs of a race that loved the mind, and sook out a partner in the vast loneliness.From there it was simple.Corrupted by time though they were, the maps in the decayed machines were legible enough to find their home system.We were ecstatic to find proof of what could have been the first Navigators of the stars.We found their bodies next.What was left.Their planet had long since moved on from their passing, though the scars were still visible.We... we never counted on that.Every species of our fledging government had their representatives.Diplomats, statesmen, military minds.It never occurred to us to bring archaeologists.Gravediggers.When they arrived, they told us through tears and misery that these myths, these titans, had never left their home system.Not truly.What few traces their planet had not yet redacted pointed toward a race tortured by itself.At once selfless and greedy, violent and pacifist.Just like our own.These were no gods.They just simply were.They were, until they tore themselves apart at what could have been the height of a golden age.And so we left.Their were the usual signs that sentient life could still develop, and our noninterventionist policies were still quite in effect, according to our leaders.I believe they only said so to prevent debate.They, just as I, did not want this world taken apart to study this would-be leviathan.They had deserved the peace they desperately searched for in life.And so, we found the lessons we had searched for.Far harsher than any of us had expected.Far more real than any we had feared: They *could* have been the first Navigators.The system known once as Sol by those who called it home became known as Ur.For it was the first, but we would not allow it to be the only.
