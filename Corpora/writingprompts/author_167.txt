We all knew what it meant of course.Dont look at the moon, an inside joke.Were on the hardcore server of course, the debug HUD is still splayed across the ever shifting star patterns, and the exit button is on the moon.Just hover your gaze on it, and you get back to the real world.But were on the hardcore server.Even to look at the sky is kind of lame.Can you hack it?Most of us are in-universe.Dont look at the moon Youre too soft.You cant hack it.Quit back to the real world.Dont look at the moon.Theres a nightmare server too.The star patterns, they shift, but they dont relate to our server.Theyre encrypted.For emergencies only.Dont look at the moon.On the nightmare server, the button on the moon is missing.If you look up, the moon just looks like the moon.White.Featureless.Moonlike.On the nightmare server, you cant just quit the simulation on a whim.On the nightmare server, the simulation is for real.Dont look at the moon.On the nightmare server, Dont look at the moon is a reminder that youre locked in.Its more of a threat than a taunt.DONT LOOK AT THE MOON.On the nightmare server, theres no button on the moon to click.But were still playing hardcore right?The button is still there right?Unless theres an emergency in the real world, then the safeties click in, even on the nightmare server..

DONT LOOK AT THE MOON

  then the safeties CLICK IN because there IS AN EMERGENCY IN THE REAL WORLD
 
    AND YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE MOON
