Part One

I got fired last week for the 9th time this year.I don't always mean to run my mouth, but when I do, it sprints.This time, it wasn't even my fault (initially, anyway); if only that dumb fucking Russian bartender would have kept his mouth shut.Oh well... No sense crying over spilled martinis.It's not hard, finding a gig as a bouncer, especially in cities.After my fourth attempt at holding my tongue (and fists) at a new bar, I bought a camping van off some poor prick who needed the cash to pay for his divorce.Being essentially unhireable makes for a great old-fashioned, transient lifestyle.A few weeks go by before I start to run out of money.I begin scrolling through ads online, keeping my eyes peeled for job opportunities, but by now word has gotten around about how I told the owner of the last joint to go fuck his hot daughter.Soon, I find myself looking for gigs in the next state over.Part Two

I don't even look at people beyond their waist anymore, which especially annoys bigger women.Knowing someone's age is like having transparency goggles: you see right through their bull shit.It's great, for professional purposes, but it's put a serious damper on my personal life.Occasionally, I do look up.If a girl smells good; if a man's voice is resilient and kind.These times are few and far between, but they happen.Like this morning, at a local coffee shop."Excuse me?"I looked at the woman's waist."Yes?"I ask, keeping my head low."Are you looking for work as a bouncer?"What the hell?I look up at the girl with the raspy voice.She's got on heavy black eyeliner and full, plump dick-sucking lips.My gift indicates to me that she is 26 years old.We make eye contact, and I realize that this girl is drop-dead gorgeous.She points gently at the stack of potential work ads I've collected and printed out.I feel stupid.I ignore her and get back to scrolling on my phone.She stands there a while, both of us uncomfortably silent.Finally, she slides a piece of paper on the table."In case you're interested," she says, and walks away.I look at the paper.It reads:

Madame Bijou's
55 Walker Street
9pm, don't be late.Part Three

8:55pm.Fuck, I'm early.Madame Bijou's is located in a very popular part of the city, in an alley off to the side.It gives off a speak-easy type of vibe, perfect for those of us who don't enjoy teeny-boppers getting too drunk before 10pm.Perfect for me, makes my job easy.I haven't seen the girl from the coffee shop, but a Stevie Nicks chain-smoking woman who looks just like her approaches me at 9pm sharp."Make it to 1:55am and I'll pay you $100," she says, pointing at the bar stool next to the door, and walks off.Her age indicates that she's 64.The night starts slow, but picks up around 11.I have not seen the girl from the coffee shop, or the older hippie woman.Around 12am, I kick out some drunk Marines for being douche bags.Around 12:30am, I deny my first group of underagers.Their IDs look exactly like McLovin's.1:29am comes around, and the whole place empties out, almost like clockwork.Strange, since bars don't close until 2am.I peek my head inside the club, and I see the bartender wiping down the bar top.1:39am, I close the door behind me as I walk inside.The bartender is 41."I'd offer to get you a drink, mate, but we have to be out of her by 1:55am."I don't make eye contact with him as he says this."I heard.Why not 2am?"I ask, keeping my eyes on the floor.I can hear the bartender smirking."You don't want to know."He heads out around 1:49am, but I still haven't seen Stevie Nicks.She sure as shit better pay me for tonight.I wait patiently, and at 1:55am, she emerges.She seems to be in a hurry.She ushers me out of the bar and hands me a $100 bill."See you tomorrow, pretty boy?"She asks, turning the lock on the bar door."Suppose so, Madame Bijou," I say to her.She forces eye contact with me, her smile fading.She checks her watch, sighs, and leans closer to me.She whispers: "get out of here before 2am," and walks in the other direction.Now I have to know what this is all about.1:56am.1:57am.1:58am.1:59am.I guess I expected some sort of apocalypse at 2:00am.When nothing happened immediately, I laughed at myself for being so foolish as to believe in the superstitions of people I had just met.I looked at my watch, which read 2:01am, and began to make my way towards the van.I took one last glance at Madame Bijou's, and there she was.On the other side of the glass was Madame Bijou, flashing her rotten teeth at me, her wispy gray hair flowing down to her knees.Her age read 3,378.Somehow, she reached her hand through the glass and pulled me into total darkness."HELLO??"I shouted, reaching for anything I could touch, so terrified I pissed myself a little.I began to hear footsteps coming toward me."WHAT THE FUCK, WHAT THE FUCK," I panicked, still reaching into nothingness for something to grab onto.The footsteps got closer."You were warned," said a voice somewhere in the hollow space around me.Suddenly, a bunch of numbers started to appear at once.4,707; 2,856; 5,302.I kicked and screamed, until I felt like I could no longer breathe.I woke up the next morning in my bed, with teeth marks covering my entire body.
