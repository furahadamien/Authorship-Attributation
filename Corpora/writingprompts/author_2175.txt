"Did everyone remember to level up your characters?Level 4 increases the intensity of this experience, so be sure you've given yourself all the skills you can.You'll need them."Ytverx grinned wickedly, the light glinting off his crown and nearly blinding the others.Aralynn rolled her eyes as she flicked her finger, her parchment unfurling on the table at her gesture."At least you lit enough torches this time.I would have been able to change that tire if it were light enough for me to read the correct modifier.""Still bitter about needing me to push your car home, eh?!"Hector plopped himself into his chair, making the wood groan under his mass.He pulled a leather purse from his pocket and dropped it unceremoniously on the table, where it spilled bone dice onto the elegantly carved oak.Ytverx had commissioned an artisan to carve useful markings into it, forming a grid on which was already sketched out a chalk outline of a home.The same home that Aralynn, Hector, and Wyvyl's fantasy counterparts resided in.*"I* still think we should have used one of our Three-A rescues to get that car home."A thin, high voice called from the chamber entrance.Aralynn looked up with a surprised grin."Wyvyl!I thought you would be gone today... were you able to undo the curse?"The necromancer approached, limping.Her hair was matted and her skin deathly pale... to a slightly more extreme degree than usual."No, but the healer assured me it won't be passed on unless someone kisses me."She threw a disparaging glance at Hector."That was in character!"He protested, arms crossed."And I'm glad we saved our Three-A call... what if the car gets stranded on a freeway?We don't want to have all our toes cut off before then!"The others had given up on convincing the barbarian that the rules did not, in fact, call for removing characters' toes as a means of payment for car services.Homophones were not his strong suit.Ytverx pulled out his hidebound tome of rules and propped it on the table between himself and his players, creating a shield behind which he could make notes and roll dice without the others seeing the results."I have something particularly difficult in mind for your next quest, but if you'd like your characters to do anything in particular beforehand, I'll give you, say, half a day in game time for free actions.""Ooh!I've been waiting for this!Now that my animal husbandry skill is higher, I want to make a video of my dog doing a trick!"Hector was already rolling the appropriate die."Thirteen!Plus three, is..."

"Sixteen," said Aralynn, unwilling to wait for Hector to perform addition on his own."A fair result," said Ytverx."You capture a moment on video during which your dog performs a backflip.Would you like to post it to The Internet?"Hector nodded."Of course!""I'd like to do the same with my cat," said Wyvyl.Ytverx gestured toward her pile of dice."Go ahead."Wyvyl rolled, and her face fell."Eight.But I have my animal husbandry proficiency as a veterinarian, so the total is... also sixteen!"She smiled, pleased to think she should be able to capture a moment similar to Hector's dog flip."You capture a video of your cat rolling onto its back and meowing," Ytverx informed her."But..."

"You chose a cat as your companion animal.They are *much* more difficult to train than dogs," he preemptively cut off any protest about the unfairness as he rolled his own dice out of view."Now, Hector, your video of your dog proves popular, and earns you... one dollar and fifty three cents in currency.""Yeah!"Hector slams his fist on the table in celebration."Wyvyl, your video of your cat proves *more* popular, and earns sixty-two dollars and eleven cents."Now it was Hector's turn to protest, but Ytverx raised his finger for silence."Cats are difficult to train, but they provide bonuses on The Internet.This is all in the rules that *everyone* had a chance to read.Does anyone else want to do anything before the quest?"Aralynn shook her head."Let's get on with it."Ytverx handed a folded piece of parchment to Wyvyl."This arrives for you in the mail."She took it gingerly, unfolded it, and read, her eyes widening."Oh no."Looking back and forth between Ytverx and her other players, she swallowed."I doubt we're prepared for this.We've been invited..." She turned it around to show the rest.On the parchment was some text accompanied by a large, colorful rendition of a pine tree dressed in baubles."To a Christmas party!"
