...and then no pain, just a floating sensation.The kind that you get when take off, being pushed into your seat as the nose of the plane points towards the clouds.I was conscious of my surroundings, but confused.I couldn't see anything but knew everything was there.The giant gate came out if nowhere, like a white monolith situated in the densest of cloud.The left side swung open and a whisper of harps could be heard as I moved closer to the open gate I could see people running as a herd.Almost animalistic as they pushed and shoved each other, I'd only ever seen anything like it on TV when birds fly together and black out the sky.Then it appeared, a frameless image at least 100ft square.80 percent of the screen was Steve Irwin's face.He gave the happiest of winks towards me and then a series of images flashed on screen.A booming voice played over the images:
"Come see Steve take on the wildest of creatures.Megladon the seas largest killer.Cthulu 8 arms ain't got nothing on Steve, Bigfoot has been spotted and Steve's not happy.I joined the flocking crowd and descended into the auditorium below the giant image of Steve.As I glanced back the glimmer in his eyes and his smile was infectious.I was home.*Sorry for grammar mistakes I'm terrible at stuff like this*
