The phone rings, I pick it up only to hear cars honking and sirens in the background.Finally my son answers.Alex: "Dad you and mom need to take Elijah and get out of the City."Me: "Whats going on?"Alex: "The army is rounding up people and taking them away."Me: "Why?"Alex: "I'm not sure, but they are blockading the roads so you will need to be quick.Meet us at...." 
The phone cuts off.No signal.I wake up Joy and my grandson Elijah.We pack a small bag and head to the car.Some of my neighbors are out in the streets looking confused.I ask my neighbor Bill what's going on.Bill: "Our car won't start."That's odd.I check mine.It won't start as well.I open the garage to see if my non-self driving car has the same issue.It starts up fine.We load up and hit the road.Cars are lined up in the street stuck in the middle of the road.People are walking towards the highway.A frantic man jumps in front of my vehicle.Frantic man: "We need to go to the hospital.My wife is having a baby."His wife is laying on the ground clutching her belly.We put them in the backseat and head to the nearest hospital.Swarms of people are surrounding the place.The military has fenced off the area, and created a huge tent for the entrance.We are stuck in the car.Pregnant woman: "The baby's coming!"Frantic man: "I can see it's head!"Moments later he pukes.Frantic man: "What the fuck is that!"Pregnant woman: "Help Me!"Crawling out of the woman's vagina is a giant lobster.
