This idea is actually already a short story called "Metamorphosis" by David Eagleman!It's in a collection of 40 stories of different possibilities for what the afterlife holds.The book is called "Sum" and it's one of my all-time favourites.I even have a spare copy so that I can lend it to people without worrying about losing it!
