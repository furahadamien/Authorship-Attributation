LondonGIR
I tell you man, the harmonium, and god, the bells...THE BELLS!It all started at the county fair.It was supposed to be a diplomatic visit.The president was supposed to do a quaint meet and greet followed by a photo op with the WI, and the quaint British traditions.Guaranteed to raise the approval rating from the foreign trip.Spawn a couple of think-pieces on the special relationship.That sort of thing.God why won't anyone believe me.They came at us with sticks!They tapped Agent Carter on the ankle, and he just fell down shaking, It couldn't have been anaphylactic shock from the Victoria sponge!They all moved in this lockstep, dancing towards us spiralling around us.Your eyes were just drawn to the ribbons and hankies, it must have been some sort of hypnosis!I'm telling you!Why won't you believe me!What?I don't know why the crowd was all cheering and clapping.It was fucking creepy, watching their dead eyes and their robotic motions.It must have been some sort of mass hypnosis.But what happened next, I couldn't move.There was some sort of weight pinning me down.They skipped I tell you, Skipped up to POTUS, and just tapped him on the forehead.They just carried on down the street, the whole gang of them.I'm not crazy, but the bells, why won't anyone believe me!
