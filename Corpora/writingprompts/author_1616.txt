***That's impossible***

The thought entered my mind and it would not leave.I mean, there's no way right?I forget a few things here and there.Where I left my keys, my phone, or a small object.I forget to tell people something every so often.I also forget why I entered a room occasionally.But I *do not* forget to take off a VR headset for 15 years.That's just... impossible.Yet, I racked my brain and could not for the life of remember taking it off, putting in my bottom drawer with all my other old or boring toys, or even ever seeing it again.*Maybe mom took it off when I fell asleep or something.* No.She always used to have to take off my glasses and would always leave them on my table.My glasses, or a hat I left on, or my phone, or even a sucker I left in my mouth.They were always left on the table.Okay, I'll go through the day from the start.It was a memorable day after all.First, I remember waking up while it was still dark outside so I decided to wait for the sun to come up.I sat at my window looking outside.As the soft blue glow started to envelop the sky I grew more and more excited."I'm 10 now!"I whispered to myself.I continued watching.It felt like forever before anything too much changed."This is so boring."The moment the first glimpse of the top of the sun appeared I leapt out of bed.I raced up the stairs and into the kitchen.While screaming."MOM!!!DAD!!WAKE UP, IT MY BIRTHD-" suddenly my feet flew out from under me.**THWAK**

My face hurt.Like a lot.I started to feel my throat tighten and thought to myself, *come on.Dont cry, you're not a baby anymore* my dad came rushing around the corner to see me balled up on the floor covering my nose with tears forming in my eyes."Charlie, what did I tell you about running in the kitchen like that?"He was slurring a bit In his tired grogginess.I sniffled and tried to sound like I wasn't crying, I dont think it worked, "not to do it-" *sniff* "or I'll hurt myself."My mom had appeared behind him by now.She looked and me and softly said, Charlie!Oh no, are you okay?"And bent down to me.I couldn't hold it anymore, the pain was too much and I just started wailing. "let me see dear."I sat up and moved my hand, some blood on them."Oh no, Joey he has a bloody nose, get some napkins."Then dad went off the the kitchen.I while later my nose stopped bleeding but it still hurt.Mom was rubbing my arm while side hugging me and said, "Are you ready to open your presents?"I sat up, rubbed my eyes and nodded.My smell had come back and I could smell food."Is dad making breakfast?""Pancakes, eggs, and toast."Mom answered.I instantly smiled and started running."Charlie."Mom called after me with the*listen to me now* voice."Sorry mom.No more running.Got it.c I didn't run but I definitely sped to the kitchen as fast as I could go.We had breakfast, it was so delicious.Then it was time for presents.My first present is always the lamest one.Usually socks or a shirt or pants.Mom always made sure of that.This year it was an iron-man shirt.I smiled, said thanks, and eagerly awaited the next present."Here you go!"Mom handed me a box as big as my head!I tore open the present, and quickly started hopping in place."No way!You got me the VR Glasses!"All my friends had them, and they seemed to never take them off."Goggles Charlie, but yes.Now, there isn't anything installed on there yet so-"

"Thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou!"I said hugging her.She laughed and said, "make sure to thank your father too, they were his idea after all."I gave dad a big hug too.But I quickly turned them on, ignoring the 5 other boxes and bags in the room, and put them on my face.They fit over my glasses, and the edges made everything look funny, but when the screen came on it was all I saw."Woooooah!"I gleefully said.I used the controller in my hand to choose something.There were only a few options tho.Nothing cool.Just a tree explorer and videos.I began saying I want to see the other things.Mom said we could install more games after we set it up.Then nothing.I dont actually remember much else from the day beyond that point.Just nothing.It's like someone just stopped a movie mid-scene.I could vaguely remember opening presents, and a party later.But nothing nearly as vivid as the start of the day.Why couldn't I remember anything more?"Charlie?You okay?"It was my boss.I must've been sitting at my desk letting calla ring forever by now.The phone was ringing and the clock had passed thirty minutes."What?Oh!Yes I'm okay."I responded.And quickly picked up my ringing phone to answer the annoying customers.I went home and as I walked in the door my girlfriend greeted me with a kiss."Welcome home sweetie.""Hey cutie, you're home early.""Yeah, Janice said I could come home early since it was such a slow day, so I thought we could watch that movie!""I would love nothing more.Just let me change" I went upstairs and got out of my work clothes.When I went downstairs Amanda had already put the movie in and popcorn was on the table."Spoiling me huh?""Well, we never get any time together since my schedule changed.I thought I'd make it a thing.""Hell yeah."I grabbed us each a brownie as I sat on the couch.We let the commercials play like usual, sometimes a good trailers comes by and we make a note of the movie to watch later.As one began for a movie we'd already seen Amanda asked, "Anything interesting happen today?""Actually yeah.I had the weirdest feeling today.You know those vr goggles ever kid had like 16 years ago?"She nodded, "Well I remember getting one too, but I never took it off.""Well it's not on you now is it?""Well, no.But-"

"Maybe your mom took it off or you just forgot.""See, that's what I thought too.But i can remember everything in clear detail on that day up until after I put them on.""So are you saying that you have them on still?""Well..."

"Cause that's gross.""Do you see them on me.""Course not.""Then I guess I'm not gross huh?"She slapped my arm, "shut up dweeb."And took a breath.A few trailer later another one we had already watched came on.Amanda started, "So if you really never took them off, what would that make the rest of the world to you?"I thought for a moment, "a simulation I guess."Amanda sat up, turned to me and suddenly kissed me.At first I was surprised, but then I felt warm and safe and comfortable.She backed off after a few far too short moments, "So, did that feel like a simulation?"I shook my head and smiled, "certainly a stimulation though."She smiled and rested her head back on my arm.Then we enjoyed the movie in a calming peace.After the movie I went to the bathroom and as I was washing my hands I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, but there were goggles over my eyes, *those goggles.*

I panicked and quickly looked up at my reflection.Nothing.No goggles.It was just me.I took a deep breath and sighed, "syking yourself out Charlie."Later that night I couldn't sleep.I went to rub my eye went my hand was stopped.My eyes shut open, it felt like goggles once more.i raced to the bathroom, flipped the light and, and looked in the mirror.***impossible***

There they were.Sitting right over my eyes.And as I stated the person staring back changed.He was me, but was slim, smaller, seemingly malnourished and weak.I heard a shout, Amanda, "Babe?You okay."I looked over at the door and as she walked up to it she began to vanish."Amanda?I said, but my voice was raspy."AMANDA."I attempted to shout,  but nothing came out.Suddenly I couldn't move.Like all my muscles refused to work.They felt like solid lead."Amanda."I mouthed.But even that drained me.I didn't sleep, but I could hear voices, a voice, female."Day 5683 since event blackout, Patient 0116 responded extremely well to treatment method 0228b.Brain scans show signs of greatly increased activity, possibly consciousness, at two points.11:48 PM March 15th, 2047.And....Right.. now.6:48 AM March 16th, 2047."I heard movement."Charlie... Charlie if you can hear me do something.Anything.""A-.......am.....an....d....a..."


"Amazing.He knows my name!"I heard more movement then faint ringing.She spoke again, "yes, this is Doctor Amanda Trims, get me Doctor James Patterson.We've got one back.Really.He's awake."She continued talking, about me and what procedure she did and more.But I stopped listening.I only had one thought.The image of Amanda, my Amanda, began to fade from my mind.I felt a tear slide down my face.
