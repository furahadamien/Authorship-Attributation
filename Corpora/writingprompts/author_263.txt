I knew the world didn't love me by the time I was a young man.I did everything I was supposed to, but the system still failed me.Of course it did - there was absolutely nothing I could offer that a couple million other people couldn't do better.When my wife left me, she gave me that old line - "I've found someone else."Of course she had.She could have picked a man at random and, chances are, she would have found a better one.It was only a matter of time.I think that's why I lived.There was no reason to kill me.I didn't join a militia, I didn't fight back.I cared about the war effort, but not enough to really do anything.When the last few brave men lost their lives on the short grass prairie and in the volcanic Mexican deserts and in the Canadian badlands, that was about it for the Resistance.There were maybe a thousand humans in hiding around the world.Death came and spared me because I wasn't worth the trouble of reaping.Ironic, isn't it?We all want to believe in a just world - we'd all like to think that the greatest heroes survive - but it's just me.And I was one of the few who inherited the great Human Power.Fire.That's what I can control.I can conjure monsters of flame and burn anything to ashes.Pretty cool, huh?I should go and use it against them.I should go and take some revenge.But why?The sun will still be hot and I will still be hungry and the fine gray dust will still be everywhere.Confucius talked about "filial piety."He meant that children have a responsibility to their parents and elders.I can relate to that because I'm feeling a little bit of it right now, but for my whole civilization.The old heroes, the old gods, they tell me to fight.Dylan Thomas tells me "Do not go gentle into that good night."Odysseus and Achilles and Socrates and Plato and Newton and Descartes and Picasso and Hemingway and Churchill and Roosevelt and Washington and Lincoln and Nietzsche all ride on my shoulders.But they're heavy.And I don't think I can carry them.I have that strength which in old days moved Earth and Heaven.But I don't think I'm the man to use it.I think I will stay here, on the ground, in the dust, and wait for the end to come.
