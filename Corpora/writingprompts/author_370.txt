Not 10 minutes later a helicopter lands in my backyard.I approach and hesitantly climb in.We zoom off into the sky when about 30 minutes later, we land in a large field at what appears to be a music festival.I follow a man in a suit and dark sunglasses to what appears to be one of the dressing rooms for an artist who was performing at the festival.I walk in to find John Ford Colley sitting there getting his makeup and hair done.He turns to me, "Did ya get my letter?"he says.Turns out, he started spelling his last name with a "K" now.We went on stage and killed it together.Fin.
