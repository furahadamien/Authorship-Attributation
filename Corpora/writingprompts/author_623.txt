It was the kind of discovery that felt like it should have been made on microfiche.I should have had to hunt around the library awkwardly, waiting for a librarian to look as if she had found a moment earmarked for my interruption.A few minutes of hemming and hawing about how I need help while she flexed years of experience and avoided rolling her eyes that yet another asshole in the library didnt seem to realize that her job is being a professional research assistant.I would follow her to a special section of the library, she would pry open a sticky, ornery drawer and pull out a tiny roll of microfiche.In all likelihood I would be unable to avoid saying something like What is this, a newspaper for ants? and again she would show off how well she can not roll her eyes at me.Finally, maybe forty-five or so minutes later, pen stashed over my ear, my hand against my forehead, pushing my hair out of my face I would make the discovery and lean back from the reader dramatically.The internet makes these things much less sexy.I clanged a series of keywords in no particular order into Google and clicked a bunch of things.There it was.Very little mystique.Instead of cinematic build-up, its just me going, Huh.

The mask obscured things quite a bit in the photo because its a real mask, not one of those only covers your eyes bullshit eyemasks.The capes always used to wear those masks because chances are if you were a cape you were a media whore.Not that only the capes wore capes but they had that flair for the dramatic.A cape makes a certain impression and for a hero the statement they were making was always themselves.Sure, they were out there stopping villains, but whats left behind after youve stopped a bad guy?Nothing.Just you, standing front and center.So why not wear a big-ass cape.Villains tended to be more subdued, more background.Not in terms of what they did, of course, but that was the point.Villains left behind craters, wreckage, bodies.Those were their statements.You feared a villain because you knew what they could do, not because they had spiky shoulder pads.The mask in the photo just left a general sense of facial bone structure, but it had room around the eyes, space for slippage.The last thing any villain wants is to be suddenly blinded by a mask slipping over their eye in the middle of a battle.I was in the middle of a research project on villains and their cities.Trying to explore links between the culture of a place and the sort of villains that rise there.My town hadnt had a villain for decades, which is abnormal these days.I hit the library to see if I could dig anything up.I did not expect to find myself.Its surprising this doesnt happen more often.Slate was a roamer; he didnt have a home city.Hed defeat a villain, wipe them clean (hence the name), and then move on.Must be that when you have to rebuild your entire life over again you have more pressing matters than what all the supers are doing, to say nothing of bothering to look into what they used to be doing.The eyes are mine.Theres no question in my mind.There may be things I dont know, gaps here and there, but I know myself.When all you have to build from is your body and your face and what hints it may hold about where you came from, you study it closely.Across this gulf of time and situation I would expect a photo like this to be alien.Disconcerting.Like looking at another person in another body.Im a past-middle-age community college student starting to worry about what I need to get done to manage a semi-plausible retirement in twenty-odd years.This photo is of a brutal supervillain reveling in carnage and power.But looking into those eyes doesnt feel like staring at a stranger or looking back on days gone by.It feels like looking in a mirror.
