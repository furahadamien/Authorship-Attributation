It happened again.On the way home I heard the noise.I turn around and it was a hooded man, no different from the others.I shot at him with my Browning, but this time I missed all 7 bullets.He quickly disarmed me and threw the gun to the side.I thought this was the end, one of them had finally bested me, but I was wrong.He told me to meet him in the back alley by the homeless shelter tomorrow morning.I will go inspect what he is up to.if he wanted to kill me, he would have already.**July 5, 1910**

He says his name is Bob.He was standing by an easel and was holding an assortment of paintbrushes and colors.I asked him what he wanted from me.He said that he wanted to teach me to paint.After a brief argument, he convinced me that I had it in me to become a great artist.He has a very persuasive voice.If only one day I could be as eloquent as he.We started with painting an open field.I did my best, but I could tell that it was unsatisfactory.The way the lines flowed more matched that of a choppy ocean than a pasture.He never got mad though.In fact, he had me keep going with what I had.He told me to take the titanium white and paint some clouds.As I painted, I realized that each cloud was softer, fluffier, more cloud-like then the last.Once I had finished, he took the painting.It was passable.Not good, but better than my past accomplishments.He asked me to come back at the same time tomorrow.**August 2, 1910**

Bob told me that if I was to apply to art school in June, I would need to do better than just improving.I would need to be flawless.Not once in the last month has he ever made a complaint, yelled, or told me to start over.His patience is incredible.I asked him what the future is like.At first, he pretended to not know what I was talking about, but once I told him that I knew he was a time traveler, he came clean.His name is Bob Ross, hes from 1994, and he has come to the past to educate people in the dying art of painting.Apparently, my generation has many sub-par painters who cause a chain reaction, destroying art as we know it.Bob Ross is the last painter, and he wants to revive the art, even if it means he can never go back to his own time.**October 30, 1910**

My painting skills are improving.Bob helped me get over my depression by having me paint Happy Trees.  He has me paint those a lot.I wonder why.He knows exactly everything going on in my life.Sometimes it still amazes me how perceptive he is until I remember that hes from the future.He knows Im homeless, uneducated, and fed up with the world.But his soothing voice makes everything seem like it will be ok.In other news, Bob has developed a nasty cough.Hopefully he will get better soon.**January 10, 1911**

Last week Bob told me to let the art flow through me, both figuratively and literally.Well, today I came to our little art studio sporting a paint brush mustache.I asked Bob what he thought.He said it was fine, but I could tell it disturbed him.Perhaps it makes me look like a murderer from his time.No matter, if it was important, he would tell me.**May 19, 1911**

Bob Ross is dead.Yesterday I took him to the physicians, but we were behind a Jewish family who all had mumps.Had the doctors have been quicker, they could have saved him.I dont know what to do.Without his guidance, my paintings have reverted to how they used to look: sloppy and lacking detail.How did he do it?**June 30, 1911**

I failed my art exam.After Bob Ross sacrificed his life so that I could succeed and bring back artistry, I failed.Now I can only think of one thing to do.I need to rebuild the world, so that art can flourish again.Ill start with Europe, unify them all under one banner, and make it so that artists are cherished and given the tools they need to succeed, no matter their skill level.As Bob told me every day, anyone can paint.I will make it so that anyone is able to paint, so that Bobs vision of a brighter future can be realized.I, Adolf Hitler, will take over the world, and fill it with art!
