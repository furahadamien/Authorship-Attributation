Ill have a double cheeseburger deluxe, I say looking up at the glowing menu, with fries and regular spri-- I stop as I see the cashier with mouth agape and brows furrowed.What the f she mouths, cutting off the last syllable as she hisses the f. Her confusion turned to an irritated stare obviously annoyed.I reciprocated a confused look as I fidgeted with my wallet.Oh sorry, she exclaims snapping back to reality Thats a double cheeseburger deluxe with fries and regular coke.Is there any--

Sprite! I corrected awkwardly.Regular Sprite.Is there anything else you want to add?

Nope thats it.

She writes something down on my receipt.She was slow, strokes intentional and heavy.She pauses, looks up, then scribbles again.Remember, she mutters before pushing the receipt my way.I picked a table so that my back is to a corner and read the back of the receipt.It had these weird blocky letters, I can tell they were supposed to curve by the erratic corners.None of the characters I can read save for the number 24 right by the end.I was tempted to ask the cashier what she just wrote on my receipt but that would lead to a lot of explaining and I felt like I didnt have enough energy for it.What is it?Maybe it told me that Id die in 24 hours?Maybe I owed her 24 whatever currency she wrote?Maybe she could just be crazy?\-----
