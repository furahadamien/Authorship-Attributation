The brain is as perplexing as it is mysterious.All my life I was told there would be a grand journey at the end of it.Some extraordinary transformation into the great beyond.I've heard stories about the brain firing on, at least in some form, for minutes after death.I always assumed that's where the stories came from, brought back from the dead with some profound realization about the world.Not that I thought there was ever some greater world awaiting us, just that the brain would prefer some final comfort in the last minutes before it ceased to function for eternity.And finally my time has come, my last dream.I never thought I would see angels or demons or even deceased family members.I had however hoped I would get that highlight reel people talk about.In hindsight I would have much preferred seeing the pearly gates instead of being stuck in this room by myself.It's not a special room, in fact it looks like every interrogation room Hollywood has ever thrown at me.The last remaining minutes of function and all my brain can create is an average room with halogen lighting and an uncomfortable stool.I'm not handcuffed or anything but there is another chair across the table from me.I dont know if I will get to the part in the movie where I get to see the good cop, bad cop scene play out before the screen fades to black but I'm hoping to see at least one face before I descend into the great abyss.Unfortunately right now the only face I see is my own staring back at me through the one way mirror.I always wondered how the brain managed to bend time while dreaming.Maybe it has to do with the stress of death, the will to hold on a little longer, but it seems like I have been in this room for hours.No clock on the wall, no cup of water, no noise of any kind really, just me, myself, and I.There seems to be more than enough time to review my life, where it all went wrong, but it's the last thing I care to think about.Secretly I have been waiting for this sweet release from the stress of it all, and here I am now truly waiting around for a release of some kind.It would be nice to have some company of some kind, even if it was an overly dramatic detective yelling at me about how poor my life choices were.Anybody would be nice, but no I'm stuck here with the one face I cant stand to look at, my own.My brain keeps wandering trying to think of the actions in my life that were most memorable, good and bad.I refuse to acknowledge it though.Sure there were ups and downs but I have been trying to clear my head of those life choices for too long.It seems I no longer have to contemplate them ever again.I just have to wait a little bit longer.
