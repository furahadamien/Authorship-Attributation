The Gospel According to Brad

Brad 1:1

Brad said unto the lord, "Coors is for women bro, I told you to pick up an 18 of miller light."Jesus Replied, "my brother, ye but all the ales of my father are acceptable in the kingdom of man."Before Jesus bespoke another word, Brad replied, "Ye?!?!...J.C. my dude, I did not know you liked yeezus, you know he's got a new album coming out?"Jesus said, "I know all things through the father and can tell you that this college dropout posing as messiah is nothing but an impostor."Brad said, "but have you heard the music yet, the beats are--" 
Jesus cut Brad off, "yes Brad, I listened to the album and the lyrics were redundant, and beats were garbage. "Brad asked Jesus, "deadass?"and he replied, "yes my lamb, deadass."Brad said,"Savior, what shall I listen to if not the rap prophet himself?"Jesus chuckled, "let me show you the way"

And from there they went to Galilee to purchase a new copy of Chance the Rapper's Coloring Book, as well as a couple of dope over the ear headphones meant for extended hours of continuous use so they could hear the album in its glorious entirety without hurting their earholes.Brad saw what the Lord had allowed Chance to make, and to behold, and it was very good.And on that day Christ and Brad rested, taking in god's herbs and his fruits to enhance their listening experience.And it was good, so good they listened to the album a second time.
