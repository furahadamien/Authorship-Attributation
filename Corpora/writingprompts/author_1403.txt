Lucidiosyn
How...Ironic, it is for me.My job used to be simple.Well, all things considered.A little insight on how I was created.You see the creator made me devoid of emotion except one.Curiosity.Therefore, my job would give me some sort of purpose.But now, I've given myself the task to keep these last humans alive.And they call me, Life- Ha... Haha.Humor...I think I understand it now.You see, these humans are mixture of false hope and denial.They think they are alive because I am there savor.But in reality, I'm just, well, curious.You see I've done this job for centuries now and it would be nice to see what it is like if it were the opposite.If I was asked to go to the other side.However; I don't want to die because...These humans are rather intriguing.They talk and reminisce about "the old days", and they talk about a day that will never come.Yet, I somehow admire there hope.It's also rather falsely placed.I forgot to mention.I also learned a couple of emotions recently.Boredom was one of them.Good thing they keep things...Interesting.
