It didn't happen all at once.The nations all lost their sight gradually.It was a slow seeded plague on humanity; anyone from important leaders to the homeless lost their eyesight suddenly, and what doctors tended to them could not fathom what had happened.Maybe it was mass hysteria.Maybe it was another facet of mental illness.It was waved away as just another illness to cure when there were only a few cases.The  government didn't really care at that time; it wasn't as much of a concern to them as what the president was writing on twitter.When the blindness began to spread, when waves of people were turning up blind in the streets  causing panic, unable to see, throwing themselves at cars and businesses and clinging manically to any person they could dig their fingers into  they were corralled like animals.People died in throngs then; either by waves of suicide, their rotting corpses stinking up alleys and their homes, or by police brutality.The news pedaled their wares; that those who were ensorcelled by this blindness were driven mad.They couldn't be reasoned with.To keep the public safe, if someone was 'too far gone', the police had to react swiftly and that sometimes meant civilian losses.There were protests at first.Once the desperate, untreated blind found their way into the throngs of people screaming outside of the white house and their local police stations, the riots ceased.People were too scared to leave their homes and.. the world changed.As more people fell to the blindness, those unaffected began to agree with the hysteric media.Yes, the blindness was a disease.Who cared where it came from, people were being attacked on the streets!It wasn't safe to leave your house!They were spreading the blindness!Civilian militias formed and, quietly, using the blindness of the ill against them, they killed the easy ones first.Anyone who didn't struggle was just moments away from a frenzy, by their accounts.Bars would be full on the evenings, covered in barb wire and chicken mesh to keep away the desperate, like homes and schools and anything else that had to be kept safe.Spikes were placed on the ground, tearing up the feet of those without shoes, ruining the shoes of those who had them.The blind weren't stupid.Aside from those hit with hysterics and who could barely function on their own when they could see, most of them learned quickly to keep to themselves.Many would claim they were blind before the epidemic hit, working together with those who actually had been and assistive facilities to get home, to get food, whatever they could to survive.This was short lived.It took one year for blindness to take everyone.Shame filled most of the world; those who had been killed in the initial hysterics had monuments built for them.Their names were etched, messily, into large concrete slabs that were painted and polished to be, at least to the touch, acceptable.Once the media organizations learned how in their blind stumbling, apologies were aired over the news.Groups of people came together to apologize to families of the lost.All of the anti-blind measures were removed.The ground was uneven and pocketed where once spike traps and other deterrents lived.Society has recovered as much as it can.Doctors can't use their fancy medical equipment as well as they'd like, import and export is difficult when no one can see the state of the ocean to bring goods along.People get by.Society is recovering.We live in a world of blind being lead by the blind, by those who went blind and managed to adjust first.My account was supposed to be just that.An account of things as they were; I lived through the worst of it.I was one of the hysteric many that fled into the streets first.I was terrified.Mania was replaced by fight or flight desperation for survival and I survived the first slaughter.I went home, barricaded myself inside, and did everything I could to find resources.It helped.Time after the Great Blindness took everyone has been.. okay.Lackluster, almost.I spend most of my free time sleeping.My dreams will ebb between old movies I've loved; I can see in my dreams.The knowledge I had once of what everything in the world looks like is still in there somewhere.My waking hours are spent making some money through working misc jobs online; I'd become accustomed to the voice that will read back to me as I type away at my keyboard, double checking my finger placement with the soft braille markings on top.I pause after each paragraph of writing, listening to her recounting it, making sure I've phrased and structured everything alright, that I haven't made a typo anywhere that massively changed a word into some discombobulated semblance of language.Those who have fancy self driving cars use them mostly as expensive food delivery services, and I'm lucky to have the ability to pay for that.After a delivery, mid-step in returning to the kitchen with a load of new groceries, my vision returned.
