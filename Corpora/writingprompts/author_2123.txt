There is an existing pair of novels with kinda-sorta this premise.They are called *God is Dead* and *Everything Matters* by Ron Currie Jr. 

Quick summery:

(For context) In the first book we learn that in the reality the pair is set in God took human form as an ethnic Dinka woman in Sudan and was killed by the Janjaweed.Her body was eaten by wild dogs in the bush.The wild dogs who ate God's body become omniscient but not immortal beings and are all killed by cruel humans trying to exploit them for riches/power.In the second book, set a few years after god dies (here's where this prompt comes in) there is this kid who has known since birth that the world will definately end at a specific time on a specific date via an asteroid impact, he assumes he is just crazy.In this reality, where the people of the world have now accepted that God is dead, they now worship their children instead of gods.Every person on earth has a cell phone on which they recieve hundreds of messages from a random number of a person they do not know and will never meet.This person worships them and sends them message upon message of adulation, prayres and their deepest secrets, hopes and fears.Everyone on earth sends these messages to someone.Every person on earth recieves these messages from someone.No one ever reads them.This kid reads them.There really is a person on the other end and the world is really going to end via asteroid on the correct date and time he was born knowing.Without giving much more of the plot away, everyone on earth must decide wether to leave on ships to colonize space or to stay and die with the earth.Definately among my top 10 reads of all time.Incredibly beautiful and elegantly written.11/10 would reccomend.
