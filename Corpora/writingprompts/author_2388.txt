Ol-fiksn
The man with the gift as they call him.The wanderer as he refers to himself.From his childhood he can travel in the memories of others, sometimes even change their past,  for money.However he never ever dreamed of  the whole human history, until the day the undying reavealed himself to the public...

"I have to betray you."the time wanderer's voice broke the silence."I know."replied the immortal, without any hesitation."You don't remember yet, but  when we second met, you came to me shocked, stuttered about something you're gonna do, and already did.I  understand how you're feeling at the moment, but keep in mind the future.As you said I'm not going to die."he said with a strangely comforting tone."B-but, you're gonna suffer!"yelled the wanderer."I can accept it.In fact I already accepted my fate.I'm ready to do everything for the kingdom."clanged his solemn voice.They both knew what will, did and should  happen.As the wanderer traveled in time, jumped to one random memory to another, they unknowingly became closer to each other.Jump by jump.The wanderer avoided direct contact, tried to not change things, but in a careless moment the immortal accosted him.To his greatest confusion, he spoke to him like they've already been best frends.'This not supposed to happen!'thought the shocked traveler 'intervening is strictly prohibited' but the immortal just kept speaking.He told him his story, their story and how he hides, waiting for the sign.From know then, as time heve passed they became friends, real friends.But this time the wanderer's story started to reach its end.He knew it, he knew the whole story from the very beginning, but never was prepared for the reality, even less for his friends words...

"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.Even knowing my duty, I just cannot...I... my horrible deed."a little tear appeard in his eyes."Don't apologize, it's not like I will die ar anything.We're going to  meet next time, and you will see  I have no revulsions of you.Just hurry up, you must go"

The wanderer made a small nod then just dissapeard, like he never was there.He just stood there, starring where he stood, and murmured."I already forgave you, Judas."
