"When I was a kid I used to dream of stopping time.At any moment being able to step outside of a situation, and be alone for a bit.I've always kind of moved at my own sort of pace.As if the world around me was just a little too fast, no time to enjoy the simple things.""Then one morning it did.Time stopped for a few minutes, I watched the clock stand still, and the water from the sink that was dripping freeze in the air.For a moment I thought it was me doing it, but I realized after the second or third time that it wasn't.I just enjoyed the moments while they lasted.""I realized what was happening when one day, I was sitting in a college class, and the teacher asked the girl sitting up front a math question.Time froze for a few moments, as she thought of the answer, and then restarted and she answered it immediately.""I wouldn't have had the guts to talk to her, but it was forced upon me.You see she couldn't move while time was frozen.she could just think, she was as frozen as the rest of the people.one day on her way to work she freezes time while driving to think for a minute, and I walk across the road in front of her.she unfroze time and slammed on the breaks telling me to get in the car.she parked in the parking garage and we missed the first class together talking.""I never understood why she liked to stop time while I spoke so we could stretch out our time together.She had a terminal illness, and would die within the next 5 years."I look down at the water, and the reflection of my son's teary stare, throwing the 3650th stone on the water.it doesn't skip because of the frozen time."it was selfish, I know.To make you spend most of your life in frozen time.I hope you can understand.we found out you had the gift, both of our gifts.It was selfish to make you live in frozen time just so she could watch you grow up."3650 stones skip across the water one for each day of the first 10 years of our sons life.his mother 25 years old looks up at her husband now almost 38, and her son who was exactly 10 born yesterday.She was bleeding out internally."it's not right for a child to take care of his parents.I love you, and I've watched you long enough...I've had far more time then I was meant to.Go live your own life."She says to him with her last breath.edit: my writings real choppy sounding, but I'm too lazy to fix it.I hope you can enjoy it regardless
