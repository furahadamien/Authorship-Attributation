PerpetualCamel
I look at the keyboard sitting on my desk.It beckons me to type, but I remain still.Instead of letting the words flow through my fingers, I let them run free inside my mind.They tell a story of false hope.A story that starts with hardships, broken promises, and squandered opportunities.A story that I wish I could rewrite, but it's cemented in the past and not subject to change.I look at my keyboard again, but this time I do start typing.I write of a story yet unwritten, a story I'd be proud to tell.The infinite opportunity of the future dwarfs the missed opportunities of the past, and makes even my biggest mistakes feel insignificant.I write a story of hope."I love you all," I say aloud, to nobody in particular, "I hope each and every one of you has a Merry Christmas and a happy 2018."
