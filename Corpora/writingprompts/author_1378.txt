WeeShpee
As I load each bullet into the chamber my hands start to shake a little bit more.I pull the hammer back and start feeling the desire to die being overcome by questions and anxieties, but this has happened before.I prepared for this.I look down to my dimly illuminated desk and start reading the first page of reasons why I should die.Number 3.I feel the self loathing coming back.Number 5.The regret starts flooding in like a tidal wave.Number 7.My hands stop shaking.Number 10, the tears stop falling.I'm ready.In one swift motion everything fades to black, and then dramatically flashes to complete white, the ringing in my ears becoming more and more intense.The white starts fading, and the world around me begins taking shape.After what seemed like a few minutes I feel something touch my shoulder, the ringing stops instantly, and my vision is restored to normal.Everyone is staring at me with wide eyes, they all start asking me what happened and how it was at the same time."It was ok."
