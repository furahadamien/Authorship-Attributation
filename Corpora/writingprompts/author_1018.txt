Black.White.Crunchy.Creamy.They're probably the only memory I have from before.Before the world collapsed, before humanity was defeated, before everything I loved was taken from me.The rest of the world is dull.Desaturated.Every day is an uphill battle on a never ending hill, and somehow, I manage to stay alive.The most dangerous days, though, are not those when the sky comes alive with the seemingly sole intent to eradicate the last vestiges of humanity from the planet.They're not when I start running out of water, or when I get injured and can't find the first-aid kit.No, the most dangerous days are when I remember.Memories come rushing in like a flood, and even the palest shadow of happier times paralyzes me with sadness.Blue skies.Sunny days, and nights filled with mystery.A younger, less scarred me.A less scared me.The world has colour again.______

I laugh with my family, enjoying the food my mother cooked me for me.It's the day before I leave for university, you know, so of course she had to make a special meal.My brother, upset at the fact that tomorrow, my room will be empty and I'll be hours away."Aww, is the little baby sad that I'm leaving?Don't worry; I promise I'll call often."I tell him, and he grimaces at me.My tone is teasing, but my sentiment is sincere.Nothing will stop me from calling my family.Right?Suddenly, my dad appears in the doorway, his face confused."Tell me why you've gotten a letter from Nabisco, of all places?"My brow creases, and I take the letter, opening it carefully."What is it?"My mum asks worriedly, and I pass the letter to her, grinning delightedly."You know, I don't think you'll have to worry about my food at university anymore!I've just decided my daily meal plans - nothing but Oreos.""Oh, don't joke about that!You're going to become diabetic!"She groans as I read the letter out loud to my brother."We are pleased to inform you that you have just won a lifetime's supply of Oreo cookies!"I read gleefully.My brother bursts out laughing, and after a beat, everyone else at the table does too.The future looks bright._____________

The foolhardiness of youth.I snap back to reality when the tiny bit of bread in my hand falls to the ground.It's so stale, it sounds like a rock has fallen.Groaning, I pick it back up, knowing it'll be my only meal of the day.And once again, the temptation creeps back into my heart, to creep out to the box I have stored in the back, to the one thing that could make me fall apart.Because the most dangerous days are when memories overwhelm me, and those saccharine, fat filled biscuits contain nothing but memories of happier times.I know if I allow myself to let one enter my mouth, I will never be able to recover.I will collapse under the weight of all my loss, all the pain I have buried inside me.I don't know where they come from.I don't know how they manage to get through the things that haunt the outside.I dont know who still remains to keep sending them to me.But I do know this.Those Oreos, undoubtedly, will be the death of me.
