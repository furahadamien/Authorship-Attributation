Hitler?Yeah.Heard of the guy, Gabriel sighed out between big drags to finish his cigarette.He tossed it, snapped his fingers, and conjured another  his favorite bit of prestidigitation  before looking back out over the expanse.This high up on the bone cliffs, the angel liked to say, the wails and weeping and explosions down below were faint as a ghosts fart.This high up, Gabriel liked to say, one could get some perspective.Cat wound up here at the tail end of some big surge or other, he continued with a shrug.Some big surge or other? I asked.It was World War Two!He was  Fuck, man, hes Hitler! 

I waved away the smoke hed puffed my way on purpose.I wanted one, of course.On Earth, cigarettes had been for me second only to cocaine.Here, though, all your favorite things were muted just enough that no amount could sate the desire.It turned out that the God of the Universe was a fickle trickster god, and Hell wasnt so much eternal physical torment but an eternity where nothing was ever good enough.A carton of Cowboy Killers might as well be a single, soggy, ultra-light Virginia Slim.A mountain of blow might as well be talcum powder.Nothing here had the right... kick.Gabriel shrugged, reached into his flesh satchel, and winged something out toward the Lake of Teeth.He got good distance on the throw.Yeah, wed all tuned out a few, he paused, thinking, centuries?Millennia?Time runs weird here; system update from the big guy to mess with folks that liked to be prompt.Anyway, we was plenty busy with you guys way before Eraser-Stache showed up and tried to make his mark.I mean, its, what?Two billion of you bathing apes back there now?Three?

Seven?Seven and a half when I... uh..., I balked.It was still hard to embrace the concept.Yeah, whatever, Gabriel shrugged.Thats  what?just like seven?Ten percent of the total humans what ever lived?We been over capacity since before Junior got his avatar crucified.Granted, the Big Guys decision to send all of you here after what you did to His Son did lead to a bump in intake, but its gonna be hard for any one of you to make a dent.At least any dent that lasts. 

So over here, I said, Over here, Hitlers just some  

Think he runs a little racket over south of Little Moscow, Gabriel said.Tried to make a push.Tried to take the city.He actually got it, but the city sprang up anew once hed won, twenty miles north, and the land hed conquered turned into a quagmire of mud and starving Russians.

Gabriel reached into his satchel again, produced something, shook the blood off it, and threw again.Even better distance.Keeps at it nowadays, but only kinda, he said, his four right arms shielding four of his eyes for a better view of the throw.Tries to get the weak willed all fired up about cleansing this place of undermenchen or something.Hard sell, though; why ethnic cleanse when you know its just gonna be dirty again tomorrow.Got to admire his persistence, I guess.Mans left a river of corpses, and all hes got to deal with is an army of heroes unsatisfied that he keeps coming back after they kill him. 

So whyd you bring me up here, then? I asked.Id spent weeks (months?centuries?Hard to tell with the time here.)getting close to Gabriel.Getting him to trust me.I didnt know much about the Bible, but I knew Gabriel was one of the Big Guys top dudes.He had to know a way out of here.I hadnt been that bad before.Just some gambling.Maybe a few grifts here and there.A little blow.I could really use some blow.And a smoke.Gabriel didnt belong here.He had to know something.Mostly boredom, the angel said, finishing off a smoke and starting another.With the system updates, we dont really have much to do as far as torturing you guys.Anything we could do, you guys actually wind up doing better to each other.

I raised an eyebrow.That and, you know, he said, pausing for effect.You like to feel special.Like maybe you could run game on me.Get yourself some mercy, maybe.No dice, but well wipe that part of your memory, and you can try again tomorrow.Or in five minutes.You know, with the weird time and all.Mostly, though, I thought maybe it would be fun this time. 

And... Was it? I asked, doing my best not to let him know hed gotten to me.How many times had I done this?How long had I been here?Was this my own little Moscow quagmire?Nah, he said, heaving another something toward the sea.Thats the thing about this place.Sucks all the joy out of everything. 

We watched the projectile splash down.Watched the teeth start chewing it.Gabriel waved two of his arms and flipped me off with another three as I turned and headed back to the flames and screams.I turned back, only now looking at what Gabriel was pulling from the flesh sack to throw into the sea.It was babies.Some dead.Others mute and wriggling.All of Gabriels mouths were frowning.Like he wanted to find joy in the throws but just couldnt get there.
