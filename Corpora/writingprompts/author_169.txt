I wake up to the sound of Trance techno on my phone.I enjoy trance and had turned the volume up before I'd gone to sleep so my alarm would wake me for my work day.It's 3 am.My first feeling is frustration since I was supposed to have another two hours of sleep before getting up for work.I really don't like being woken up before I need to be.I need my beauty sleep.Out of defeat, I look at my phone to see who or what has bested my subconscious.An alert that says "DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON" is above hundreds of texts that had all come in at the same time, according to my phone log.So many texts, all of them are enticing me to look at the moon: "the moon is absolutely stunning right now, check it out," "I've never seen the moon like this, it's magnificent!You HAVE to look at it," "bro, the moon is trippy right now man take a look".My instincts tell me to listen to the official alert and ignore the texts.So, seeing that it's still 3 on the nose, I figure I still have enough time to get a bit more sleep before getting up for the day.I roll back over and slip back into my dreams.Moonlight, beautiful women dancing under the stars, seemingly naked and completely uninhibited, laughing almost uncontrollably.An enthralling show, and so vivid.I wake up feeling rested, and I layed in bed for a moment replaying the dream with a sense of good feeling and mild lust.I figure, since I slept fantastically and had such an enjoyable dream, that today was going to be a good day.I grab my phone as part of my morning routine, checking Reddit and Instagram, reading a few bible scriptures, I suddenly see that my phone says it's still 3 am.That can't be right, was it daylight savings time?I had to have slept for more than an hour though.I look over at my multicolored clock I've had since childhood, and it also says 3.Something is definitely off.How in the world could it still be 3 in the morning?Just as I think this, a new wave of texts from various numbers drop into my phone, nearly slowing it down with the processing power it requires to accept these messages.All of them essentially tell me to look at the damn moon!I give.I'm too curious to pass up at least a glance at this moon, since it seems to be on literally everyones mind.I pull on some pajamas and step outside with a cigarette in my mouth, light it, and take a drag.I look up as I exhale, and stop.The moon takes up 90% of the sky.It is a deep red, yet glows as if it's red hot.I remember dropping the cigarette from my mouth because of the awe.It's beautiful.It's haunting.All of the sudden, a wave of excitement and fear wash over me.Without thinking, without even having control, still picturing that Rock in the sky, I look down at the phone in my hands.When did I bring it with me?I write "Wow, this moon is something to behold.You will only ever see this once.It is a sign.Look at it, because it may never happen again," and I press send.However, there was no one in particular I sent it to, I hadn't chosen any contacts.Yet there the text was, sitting in my message box.I look back up at the moon.By now, I've lost all motor control and my body is moving of it's own volition.As I look back up at the moon, im transported to a long stretch of road.I see headlights in the distance, quickly drawing near.It seems like it's coming right at me.I want to stop it and see what is happening and where I am, but I still can't move on my own.Instead, I lay down in the road.I turn my head towards the headlights, now sideways in my vision, and very close.I start to panic.That car is going to run straight over me.I want to get up and off the road but I can't.My heart races as the car closes the distance from 100 yards, 50 yards, 20 yards.I try to scream out at the car drives straight over my chest, but instead remain quiet as the vehicle continues down the road as if nothing happened, and I feel a pain beyond anything I've ever felt in my life.The pain grows as my organs seep through the puncture wounds from my ribs, until finally, I lose sight and take a final breath.I'm transported again, confused and scared for the life that I thought I had just lost.This time, I find myself at the edge of a rooftop, looking out towards the city skyline.I have a sheer nanosecond of tranquility as the beautiful skyline touches my heart.But I look down.My body leans forward, and falls off the edge.I cannot understand what is happening.Even more pain as my body slams against the pavement, blood spraying upon the impact from orifices and puncture wounds, and blood curdling snaps as my rib cage and skull collapses on themselves.Pain continues as I subside to death.Transported again.At this moment I realize that by looking at that moon, I subjected my consciousness to be moved to every victim who chose not to listen to that warning, and i am to be subjected to the torturous death that comes with gazing upon that moon.How long must I endure this hell?Will it ever end?I cannot take the pain, but no matter how hard I fight, I cannot win.Oh, how I wish I had listened.
