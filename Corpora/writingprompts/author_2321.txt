"It's you!"She held up her red and yellow tablet, her eyes wide and full of excitement."I know how to spell your name now!"I was silent for a bit.Thinking and feeling.It looked very familiar.It was me, but I had almost forgotten what I looked like.I would stand for hours in front of the mirror while she slept hoping to see myself, but it was always fruitless.I cry a lot when she's sleeping.She's a nice little girl, don't get me wrong, she reminds me of my kindergarten students, but I just miss being completely alive and not something-like-alive and confined within a certain radius of a toddler.A shot to my head in my sleep is what killed me according to the article on the tablet.I was robbed of knowing that I was about to die.Everything felt like waking up to a twisted dream until the dream lasted a lot longer than any dream should.But it was seeing the other dead people at her school that confirmed my bodily demise.They gathered out by the play area while the kids were in class.It became somewhat of a support group for dead people."I want to see my family so badly.I want to tell Alex to get on a train and go north looking for them" Glen would cry.I remembered tweeting #RIPGlenChiba when news came in that our national rugby captain had overdosed in a hotel room.He was survived by his pregnant wife and two daughters.We could all feel the guilt he had for the way things had transpired."I want to answer all their questions, I want to see my boy!"He said."You don't want to end up like Saul."Ruth cautioned.In a hospital room not too far from the school was a little boy hooked up to machines all because Saul felt like he still had some unfinished business much like Glen.I wondered if Saul was there, confined to a hospital room with the only person who could ever see him lost in limbo.It sounded a lot like hell.Everybody nodded.Nobody wanted to be like Saul and yet everyone wanted to go back home and tie up loose ends or try to somehow pick up where they'd left off.Well, everyone except Ruth.I had heard that she'd killed herself.My husband had shot me and my infant child before shooting himself, the article revealed.I had no memory of him ever being violent towards me, but then again my memories were slowly but surely fading.He'd survived, but was as confined as I was.I wondered where my baby was.He couldn't have made for a good imaginary friend at a tender 6 months.Where do dead babies go?"It's mommy's birthday tomorrow.How about we ask aunty Agnes to help us bake a cake?"I said faking excitement while my non existent insides were twisting.She put the tablet down and started jumping up and down."Please, please, please can we make it blue.Mommy really loves blue!"Her smile widened as she rubbed her tiny hands together."Anything you want my little lizard"
