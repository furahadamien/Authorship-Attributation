I didn't get it at first.I was a natural 100 - like all the others around me.We should have been the luckiest humans alive, the luckiest of the lucky,  and yet we were stuck here, in that fully automated prison with its glass cells and the white, sterile outer walls.All the others, the unlucky sub-tens and the 95+ popstars and everyone inbetween, they were living their lives outside, free and happy.We could see them, every day, on the huge screens mounted in the center of the vast empty space between our cells.While we were sitting in solitude on our stainless steel beds with the thin mattress, munching on the stale white bread that was delivered every morning and evening through a tiny opening in the glass cell front by a complicated system of robotic arms, we watched.People working, sleeping, dancing.Eating huge meals, celebrating with their families.Having sex.Having children.Happiness and sadness and freedom, captured by webcams from all over the world, switching between different countries and cities every hour.Showing us what we we would never have.Mocking us.Mocking our perfect luck.I resented them.I resented every single person I ever saw on those screens.Until that day three weeks ago.The day when the sky on the screens turned gray, then almost black.Thousands, millions of vessels from, well, who knows?Outer space, we guessed.We watched as humans all over the planet were massacred.The invaders never left their ships, but they dropped bombs and poison gas and drones that found their way into every last hiding spot of humanity.Except for our fortress.So we watched them die.We munched on the stale white bread that was still being delivered every morning and evening, the automated prison functioning flawlessly as ever before, keeping us safe and comfortable while we watched humanity burn and choke and drown in their own blood.And we finally understood.We truly were the luckiest human beings alive.[Please excuse any mistakes, not a native speaker!]
