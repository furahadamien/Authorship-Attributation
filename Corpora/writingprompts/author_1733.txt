The first one was simple.I knew who it would be.I regretted how I treated her.How I tripped her in the halls.How I spread rumours about her.How I stole her boyfriend.I even apologized in my 20's...I hoped that would be enough to sway her vote.The second, I was unsure about.Who had I been the nicest too?Was it some random person from my past.A passerby?A coworker?No.It was him.My elderly neighbour from my first apartment.The one I lived in for half a decade just after college.I always made time to say hi.I'd stop by to play checkers.I was there when his wife died.I didn't realize he thought so highly of me and my actions.As soon as I saw him, I knew I had his vote.The third one caught me by surprise.It was famous doctor.An honest to goodness decent man who helped hundreds of people every year he practiced.He was much younger than me though.How did I save his life?What did I do?Then it hit me.I was working in the same town he grew up in.There was that night, right after the party.Will was drunk that night.Is Will his dad?No.That's not it.Will didn't drive that night.I hid his keys so he couldn't.If Will had left he would have killed his mother?He would have never existed?I'm still waiting on the fourth person.I've been waiting for centuries now.Has it been that long or is it longer?Time doesn't seem to exist here but the flow and feeling is ever so present.At first, the gatekeeper would not answer my questions.Why hasn't the final person shown up?They should long have died by now?Shouldn't they?Finally he spoke.Perhaps he had to get permission from whichever "god" controls this place.Perhaps he felt sorry for me.I may never know.What he said shook me to my core.What do you mean, we will never see the final person?How can they not have existed?How can the person who died from my actions be someone who never was?So I wait.Thinking, pleading, praying.Praying that the gatekeeper is wrong.Pleading that they will make a decision.Working over my life's actions.Trying to figure out what I did or didn't do to have a person not exist; that a soul I needed to pass through the plane of existence was not created due to my actions.I don't know what is worse.Being in hell or being here but I know for certain this is my hell and there is no end in sight.
