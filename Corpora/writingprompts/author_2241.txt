We know so little about the Precursors.We know that they were the first; when they evolved, they were alone in a vast universe.But we also know that they didn't despair in their loneliness; while they had their wars and their strife like any young civilization, eventually, they expanded out into the stars.In the modern era, their relics can be found anywhere across hundreds of galaxies.But even amidst so many ruins, the details elude us.Their system of data storage was never designed to last the hundreds of millions of years that separated us from them.When they left - wherever they went - they took their most advanced technology with them.Which was why their homeworld was such an amazing find.Not just their advanced technology, but their *origins!* As a young xeno-archaeoly student fresh out of the academy, it was a dream to go along.Even then, though, I never expected to find the metaphorical holy grail:

An intact memory storage unit.Not just that, a *fully functional* storage unit.I don't think you quite comprehend the sheer improbability of this.The average memory storage unit, even at the height of their empire, was never designed to last more than a thousand years.The ones from their dawn, before they'd even left their own solar system?*Decades*.And yet, there, before me, that impossibility lay.As if the universe itself had demanded it remain, protected for all time, even the tiny screen on the storage device still intact, still in perfect working order.Glyphs ran across its ancient surface, and I resisted the urge to reach out and touch it!Oh Gods, it was so tempting, to *touch* that piece of history!But even without touching it, my years of study of the original languages paid off.I scrambled to translate the runes, even as they slide off the side of the tiny screen and out of sight.This was it: This was the discovery that would record my name in history!One by one, the runes became clear, and I stared in astonishment."...Plays: 43,821,433,621,724 ....
