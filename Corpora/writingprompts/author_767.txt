"I hate this place" Maria thought as she stared out across the barren Transylvanian landscape.Leaning her head against the car window, misery tinged the blur of trees and rolling hills outside in grey.Nevermind that they were in fact mostly grey.Not even her pulp novel, purchased by a penitent parent, could hold her attention.If only her mother hadn't taken this new job, hadn't taken them away to this land of perpetual twilight.The strangling of the engine ended her reverie."We are here".Her parents could have at least tried to find a less ironic house.Towering gothic spires, a yawning entrance into the shingled maw of an old Victorian manor.Even a lone raven hopping around the yard and croaking curses at the new tenants."Dracula vs Wolfman" tumbled out of her lap and underfoot as she emerged from the car.After unloading she found it lying in the mud, spine broken.When darkness fell, there came a knock on the door.Two pale middle aged women, one holding a casserole and the other a parcel wrapped in brown paper, smiled tightly."Welcome to the neighborhood!"the one with the casserole trilled.Her mom, who had answered the door, invited them in."Oh, that won't be necessary" the other woman replied, handing her mother the parcel."Please enjoy this blood pudding as well.It takes some getting used to, but it is a local delicacy and in time you will learn to love it."Maria hung back during this exchange.Something about the women seemed off.Perhaps it was the way they smiled.Without showing their teeth.After they left, her mom unwrapped the package.It was a welcome mat."Oh how thoughtful!"her mother exclaimed "See Maria?The people here are just as nice as in Pennsylvania".By the time her mother turned around after placing the mat in front of their door, Maria was already upstairs.Midnight.The witching hour.Maria woke up from dreams of dark shifting landscapes with an incredible thirst.She felt her way down the spiral stairs, clutching the banster to fight off disorientation from her concentric descent.The moon afforded just enough light for Maria to see movement in every shadow.Finally in the kitchen, she grabbed a glass from one of the many cardboard boxes stacked along the walls.Water gushed from the ancient pipes into her cup.She gulped it greedily, some dribbling down her chin, although it had an unpleasant metallic taste.Grimacing, she filled the cup again and turned back to her room.A figure loomed on the opposite side of the kitchen table, swallowing what little light was left in the room.Maria dropped the glass, shattering it on the ground."Whwhwhat are you doing here?"She took a step back, too fearful to notice the broken glass piercing her bare feet."The same as you my child, a drink".
