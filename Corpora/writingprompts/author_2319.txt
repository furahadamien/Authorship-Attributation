Ok, it seems that the pain stopped, did I die?Apparently so, is this heaven or hell, or oh no... Purgatory?Wait, this looks like a room, not like eternal emptiness.Who is this girl?I can't remember where am I, add to that, who am I?The girl chimes in amidst the thoughts*"Sit down, let's drink some tea.Do you want a cookie?", "Sure, I'll have a cookie."I say as I sit down.Wait, it reminds me childhood.Reminds me of, Pete?Pete the plush dog, my imaginary friend.Wait a minute... Am I an imagined being!?I guess that's why everyone had an imaginary friend.I guess the faith was wrong, well, at least it's not hell, and the tea was nice, so was the cookie.
