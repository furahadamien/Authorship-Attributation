I toss in my sleep-- there's a loud buzzing ringing in my left ear, and my eyes flicker open to reveal my phone: vibrating with it's receivance of hundreds of messages."Holy shit, is that my Discord app again?I swear to god I put it on fucking silent."I grumble, and my hands fumble for the volume rockers.Without a few seconds of  effort, my phone is back on silent, and the buzzing stops.I go back the fuck to bed.The creepypasta bullshit can wait, I'm tired as shit.
