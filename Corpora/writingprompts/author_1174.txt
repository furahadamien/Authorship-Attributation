KLOWWD
I stood silently at the back of the room, in utter shock at my last 5 minuites.My last five minutes of living that is, I'm dead.I was at work, a half hour to getting done with my shift, when the executive chef walked up and handed me a beer.He was met with a very unappreciative glare from me."What," he inquired."I know what your about to say, and I'm not doing it" I reply.As I listen to his all to familiar explanation of how the worker to relieve me called in sick and I was needed for "just a few more hours," I serve up the small kids cheese burger to join the two orders of Carbonara.I admire each dish, assuring it's perfection, and allow the waiting server to take the order.I look back at the chef and gulp down the pint he provided, and reply in a defeated tone "fine but I'm taking a quick ten."As he nods and walks away I tuck a stray hair back into my bandana also feeling that my after-work joint hasn't been misplaced.I step outside behind the kitchen and with frustrated vigor I attack the joint.My lungs devoring it's essence.Flicking the small burnt carcass that was the roach away I run my fingers through my shoulder length hair and scragley beard, and with a sigh re enter the kitchen washing my hands.Upon returning to the line I notice a server headed my way, the one I just gave food to."This is no cheese," she says slidding the burger toward me.I pull the ticket off of the metal spike used to indicate a finished order, and point to the clearly printed "cheese burger."She takes it and mumbles a quick "sorry still need it" as I drop the party on the grill I notice the chef hanging his phone up and the server, yet again, returning.They both approach."He got a doctor's note for tomorrow, 
I need u, I know it's your day off...But hours right?"Says the chef smugly, Knowing he will take shifts away if I refuse."He wants tenders now" the server says.The last thing I remember was a loud shout followed by a sharp dive toward them and a fury of swings with my spatula, accompanied by the screams of my victems.The rampage was brought to close when a coworker hit me in the back of the head with my frying pan.Now here I stood.Before Odin and company."My council has deliberated long.Never has someone wielding a spatula entered Valhalla.Cooks are not Warriors.You however, as your last moments show, live such a life worthy.You brought your wrath down upon a foe.May you and your spatula bring glory to the Halls of Valhalla."At this Thor places a hand on my shoulder ushering me through a door behind me.A parade of Asgardian heros cheered as they followed.He ushered me past many tables of Devine food and drink.Past angel maidens in the nude serving everyone everything."Is that what I think it is" commenting on the golden trays of green herbs."A never ending supply of your favorite herb" he bellowed with a chuckle.The accompanied pay on the shoulder jerked me foward a tad, and through a door at the end of the Great Hall."What the hell is this," I say in horror."Warriors fight eternal in Valhalla, have fun.He left me with a chuckle, holding my spatula, in the kitchen.I am now the only cook in Valhalla."You gotta be fuckin' kidding me."
