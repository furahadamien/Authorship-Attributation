*bzzz*

I groaned awake as my vibrating phone buzzed on the bedside table.I reached out from under the sheets and looked at the notification.It was a text message.>OFFICIAL WARNING: Do not look at the moon.THIS IS NOT A DRILL    


"What the hell?"I whispered.Who needs a warning at 3 AM to not look at the moon on a new moon night?Astronomers and space geeks probably.I put my phone back and closed my eyes.It's probably a prank or something.Nothing I need to lose sleep about, I got college tomorrow anyway.I dozed off...

I woke up with a start.This was getting annoying.I reached out to my phone and turned the screen on again.I looked at the lock screen.>78 New Messages


The phone buzzed again.>79 New Messages


>83 New Messages


I swiped the screen and scrolled through the messages.I didn't know any of these numbers.I scrolled until I came across a familiar contact.>JASON L.    


My roommate, the stupid one.Why'd he text me when he could've just woken me up?I clicked on the message.>Come outside!The moon is so beautiful tonight!I looked at the other messages, they were similar.What's with this moon thing tonight?I got up and walked to his room.I opened the door.The windows were open and white moonlight was spilling through the gap in the curtains onto his floor.The room was a mess.The lamp was knocked on the floor.There were books, and papers lying everywhere.A broken mirror lay on the floor.Jason was nowhere to be found.Did someone break in?Did Jason fight him?It certainly looked like a fight had happened.As walked in, my foot pushed something.His phone.I picked it up and scrolled through his messages.He'd received the same warning as me, only a bit later.There were also many messages similar to mine telling him to look outside.I looked at his sent messages.He'd sent the same message to all his contacts and other random numbers.Fuck this.I wanna know what the whole moon thing is about.I stepped towards the window to take a look when someone pulled me back by the shoulder."No!Don't look!"a voice said.I fell down on the floor.I looked up and saw my other roommate, Mark.He was holding an umbrella and his face was covered in sweat."Ow shit Mark.What was that for?""You would've gone too.""Gone too?What are you talking about?""Didn't you get the warnings?""The one from the government or someone?""Yeah.""Okay okay.What the actual fuck is going on, Mark?""Look at this."Mark said, pulling out a selfie stick from his pocket and extending it.He put his phone in, but kept the back camera on.We walked to the window and he started a video recording.He pushed the stick through the gap in the curtains and moved it around, pointing the stick up and down and across.He pulled it back."Look " said Mark, starting the video.It was unlike anything I could've imagined, the moon was huge.As the camera moved below, there was a group of about thirty people in the distance.They were standing on the street looking into houses.Then the video ended."What are they doing?"I asked Jason."They're dragging people out to see the moon" Mark said."What happens if you look at the moon?""You become one of them.It's like some kind of mind control.I guess"    
"Is that what happened to Jason?""Yes."Mark said."We have to get out.I'm grabbing your keys.Come on."He got up."Get an umbrella.You don't want to accidentally look up and see the moon, do you?"I went to my room and grabbed my umbrella and put on a hoodie.You can't be too careful.Mark was waiting near the door.We stepped outside and opened our umbrellas.Mark opened the garage.Looking up the street I didn't see anyone coming.Someone screamed in the distance."Come on!"Mark said, as he got in the car.I climbed in the driver's seat.Another scream.This one sounded close.My hands starting to shake, I turned the ignition on.The engine roared to life.My music system began blaring."Turn that thing off!"Mark said."Okay okay!"I said, turning the volume all the way down.Then we heard something else.It was a loud screech of at least fifty people screaming.It was getting closer."Fuck fuck fuck!"I pushed down on the accelerator and we drove out the garage.In the rear view mirror I saw a massive crowd of people running towards us from behind our house.Another group across the street in front of us, I swerved to avoid them when a rock crashes through the window and hit Mark."Shit!"he said as shards of glass fell on his lap.The crowd continued chasing us and getting smaller in the mirror until they stopped and turned back.We sighed in relief."Where do we go?"I asked."Away from here" Mark said.Nodding, I turned us towards the national highway, speeding faster.There were a few cars on the road.I pushed down on the accelerator, speeding up when a someone jumped in front of our car and we crashed into him.The sound was horrible.We stopped and walked out under Mark's Umbrella.In front of us, an old man lay on the road, he was bleeding, but still breathing."We gotta help him."Mark said."What if he's one of them?"I said."He's dying!He's not gonna attack us."Mark said, putting his umbrella down.He bent down to pick him up when the man's eyes opened.His iris was pale gray.He grabbed Mark and pulled him down and kicked out with his leg, kicking the umbrella away."Isn't she beautiful tonight!?"The man cried.He rolled over with Mark on the ground.I ran towards them.The man kicked out and tripped me.As I got up I heard Mark scream.It was a terrible sound.I looked to him and saw him, staring at the moon, his iris turning from brown to pale gray."She's the most beautiful thing I ever saw."Mark said.I backed towards the car."Mark, wake up!This is not you" I said, standing near the door.Mark got up."This is me, the same me I've always been.Won't you look at the moon tonight?It's the most beautiful thing *ever*" Mark said, almost growling the last word.The man joined him, and they both charged towards me.I got in the car and shut the door as the man charged on my side, banging on the window as I turned on the ignition.Mark charged on the passenger side and tried to force himself into the car.He was screaming and growling.I put my foot down on the accelerator and drove as fast as I could.Mark still held on.I swerved the car and punched him in the face.He lost his grip and fell off as I drove off.It's been a week since it happened.The next morning I ran low on fuel in a nearby town.The town was empty save for a few people.I drove to a gas pump.A man sat near a pump."Take whatever you want.It's free."He said."Did it happen here too?The moon?"I said."Yes."The man said."Where did everyone go?"I asked."The man looked at me "The moon took them away" he whispered."What?""Took them all up in a big beam of light right in the woods.Everyone who'd looked at it".I couldn't say a word.I filled my car and drove back home.--
