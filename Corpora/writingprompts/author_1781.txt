I sat in the middle of the room, staring blankly at the television, my father's favorite song playing in the background.It is that time of the year again.&#x200B;

Smoke gradually fogged up the room, a pack of cigarette opened and empty on the table top.*Marlboro.* I started smoking when I was sixteen years old, the day he left the house, never to return.&#x200B;

"Off to buy a pack of cigarettes."he said, leaving with just the keys to the house and some chump change, not a care in the world.Wearing his plain old T-shirt, worn-out trousers and flip-flops, his backdrop vanished out of the doorway, while sixteen years old me waved him goodbye from the television couch.&#x200B;

One day.Two days.Mum began to get worried.She went down to the convenience store down by the street.They did not see my father.She went to the neighbors.They did not see my father.She called the workplace.They did not see my father.&#x200B;

Three days.Four days.Mum called the police, filing a missing person report.Fear started to settle into my chest.There, it claws and gnaws at me, eating me out from the inside.&#x200B;

Mum began digging through my father's stuff, hoping to find a clue as to where he went.None.There was nothing.His credit cards, his identification papers, the keys to his car, it is all here.For all intents and purposes, he vanished.&#x200B;

One month.Our world began to collapse.He is gone.He is *gone.* He is never coming back.They could not find him.We could deny it no longer.We no longer had a father.&#x200B;

That day, I went out to buy my first pack of cigarettes.Holding it in my hand, I cried, for the first time since he disappeared, tears dripping down to form coin-sized droplets on the parking lot behind the convenience store.Trembling, I took one stick of cigarette out, lighting it with a lighter, and took my first puff.It burns and suffocates me, smoke tearing up my lungs, yet, for a brief moment in time, it seems as if he was going to come back after all.Crying, smoking, sobbing, I burnt through the first cigarette of my life.&#x200B;

Mum began working as a dishwasher at the diner the following months, hoping to earn an income to support the family.With our father gone, we lost our sole breadwinner, and our savings are running out.We begin to cut out non-essential necessities - gone were the days where we could afford to spend our money on restaurant meals and trips.Things start breaking down and we have no money to fix them.&#x200B;

Alcohol started coming into our lives.My mum began to drink.One bottle.Two bottles.Three bottles.The floor became littered with Budweisers, each bottle representing a temporary getaway from what our lives had become.&#x200B;

One year.He has gone missing for one whole year.Smoking became a daily habit for me.My results have been slipping drastically, I lost my chance to get a scholarship at the college of my dreams.Mum began to come home later and later, drinking more and more, the house becoming more disorganized, more decrepitated.The heater has been spoiled for close to three months, the dishwasher spoiled for two.&#x200B;

On the same day he went missing, the both of us, Mum and I, sat around the living room and cried.&#x200B;

Five years.Mum has been dating someone else for close to a year now.I flunked out of college and began taking odd jobs around town for some cash, working at the bottom of the barrel for minimum wage.My new potential step-dad is the owner of the diner.Mum no longer wept on the day he goes missing.His stuff is now packed in cartons and locked up in the attic.Things began to change for the better.&#x200B;

Still, though, on the day he left, I would still wonder what happened to him.&#x200B;

Eight years.I am the only one living in the house now.My Mum moved out of the house to live with her new husband, who also happened to have kids of her own.I met them.Zackary and Daniel, ten and thirteen respectively.At least she is not drinking as heavily now.&#x200B;

I have gotten into a trade school, currently training to be a plumber.It pays more than what I have been working as for the past few years.I met someone I really liked at the trade school.Maybe I should try to confess to her.&#x200B;

I still wait for him the day he left.&#x200B;

Present.I burnt through the cigarette, smoldering it in the ashtray.The day is coming to an end.I gaze at the door.No one.&#x200B;

I began to chuckle, before it turned into a roaring laughter, before it became a cry, before it became a despairing wail, my fist pounding on the worn-out cushion in pain and agony, cries of a wounded animal echoing through the room.&#x200B;

*He is never coming back, is he?He is gone, just like that, for close to ten years.Ten.I should have given up long ago...I really should have...*

&#x200B;

The door opens.I stop in the midst of my tracks.Footsteps, echoing in the walkway.&#x200B;

"I am back.Oh gosh...why is the house full of smoke?"&#x200B;

Possessed, I turn my head around.There he is, in the same plain old T-shirt and trousers, carrying a bag of cigarettes, waving his hand around the house, exactly the way I remembered it ten years ago.&#x200B;

I stood up, got out of my the couch, went over and gave him one big hug.&#x200B;

"Dad...you are back.Finally.You are back."\*\*\*

*I lied*.I am sorry.*I lied*.I am sorry.*I lied*.*He will not be becoming back, won't he?* I looked at the cigarette in my hand, offering it to my father.*He is gone, isn't he?* 

He took the cigarette from me.*Yes, he is gone.You knew it a long time ago, didn't you?* Taking a deep puff, he pointed at the door.*He will not be coming back.* 

I sighed.*Of course.I always knew, wasn't it?Thanks, Pappy.* 

He passed the cigarette back.*No problems, son.Good to see you again, for one last time.* 

I knew.I knew, yet I waited.I looked at the cigarette in my hand.Everyone has moved on but me.I took one last puff, before grounding the final cigarette into the ashtray.\*\*\*
