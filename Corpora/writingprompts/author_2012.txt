I was weary.Its hard to imagine someone who is dead still being able to feel, but maybe the constant exposure to extreme human emotion had allowed me to still feel.I had wallowed in immeasurable suffering, but had also bathed in the light of someone surrounded by family, going to meet their god.I didnt know what was on the other side myself.I was the first human to die after all, betrayed and murdered by my brother, Cain.The centuries had worn away any resentment I could possibly still harbor.I wasnt prepared to die then, how could I have been?It hadnt happened before.Life was strange and lonely enough, my parents were always speaking of some powerful being they used to commune with in some garden, but we had no idea what they spoke of.Maybe that was the source of the light I saw when I died...yet somehow I knew that, although I was the first, I wouldnt be the last.And surrounded by the still fresh sensation of a brothers betrayal, how could I abandon those who followed?And so time went on.I could still see the material world to an extent, as I was drawn from one death to another.I saw it change and mature, and was excited for the future of my species, for we had come so far.And yet, we still had so far to go.Pompeii had shocked me to my core, it was difficult to transition all those souls to what lay beyond.So many at once, confused, unaccepting.It was always easier for those who were sick and knew they were dying, but this was unprecedented.And again later, uncountable battles, hundreds dying within minutes.If I was still bound by physical laws, I mightve tired, but I persisted, and guided them all, eventually.What I yearned for was the solution to my loneliness, but I knew that it would never come.The best I could do was to serve my kind, and ease their transition.Until I met Brandon.I was first drawn to him one night when he almost committed suicide.I could sense his impending death, but he decided not to at the last moment.But what I saw shocked me.Brandon was truly a kindred spirit in loneliness.I could see that he had no living family, and no friends to speak of.Although time does not pass the same for me as it does for others, my free time is still limited, but I always found time for Brandon.I watched him, rejected by society for his mediocrity.Not smart enough to do overly well for himself, he was the definition of scraping by.Not charismatic enough to make friends or meet lovers, he scrolled through the routines of his life with minimal joy.Brandon went to work, went home, played some video games, made a sandwich or a microwaved dinner, and went to sleep to refresh his body to repeat this hell for another day.I was truly appalled.The variety of experiences I had glimpsed in his world, and here he was unwilling, or possibly unable, to see anything beyond the bleakness of his existence.Brandons time inevitably came.I greeted him as a friend as his soul left his body.He looked down at it for a moment, but came to terms quicker than most.What got me? He queried aloud.Heart attack.Microwaveable meals and takeout are not the healthiest of diets.Ive seen this before, unfortunately youre not the first.

Huh. That was it, his entire reaction, possibly summing up the futility of his life, as he stared down at his lifeless body.Well, I didnt even really feel it, or, I dont remember feeling it.

A mercy that many in history have not had the some fortune to experience, believe me.Are you ready for whats next?

Brandon stood, silent for a moment.Who are you?Why are you doing this?

I was the first, so long ago.I stayed.Truthfully, Im not sure I realized what happened to me.It hadnt happened before you know.I didnt have the luxury of experiencing death second or third hand, and slowly accepting its inevitability.As to why I do this, all I truly remember was my loneliness here, in this place of transition.Not attached to the material, yet, unarrived at the final destination.

What is the final destination?Pearly gates, or maybe more of a courtroom judgement setting?

I do not know.I cannot cross and find out.Perhaps that is my curse, but these people need someone.You accepted quicker than most, but perhaps that is because you had considered treading this path voluntarily before.Those who die unexpectedly are much more difficult to handle.Everyone goes eventually.I can only hope Im leading them to peace, and not torment.

Brandon didnt even seem phased by this, he just stared through me with a strange expression.I could feel light and warmth behind me, the sensation that always precedes a decision to pass on from this transitional state.You should go, he said.I started to move over to lead him before what he said sunk in.That destination is not my path, but yours.You must go.

No.My whole life, I was unable to do anything for anyone, not even for myself.My existence was bleak, but not truly miserable.I often felt misery, and sadness, but more than anything else I know your loneliness.Ive been immersed in it my entire life.Im just the quiet guy who works and goes home, only to show up the next day.I never could figure out how to make friends without bothering people, never could find the desire to even go out and try.But herethis place...this feels like home.

I couldnt comprehend what he was saying.It made sense, but simultaneously felt like a dream, and I felt myself gliding backwards into the light.I realized Brandon was guiding me now, just as I had guided others.As the light began to surround me I looked back at him, this man who never did anything with his life, who couldnt, but in death, was able to free the one soul that in the millennia of human existence, had never found it.
