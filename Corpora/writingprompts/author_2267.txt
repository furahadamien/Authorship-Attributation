We always thought we were alone, and now... were not so sure.The year is 1636, and weve begun exploring space for the last few centuries.We sent out a probe to the closest solar system, and well it finally came back.A yellow dwarf star, average sized, estimated 6 billion years old orbited by 9 planets.The two closest to the sun are, unsurprisingly barren waste lands, but there are still two continental worlds past that.We were mostly interested in the continental worlds, and the probe deployed two rovers, one for each planet, of course.We werent expecting what we found, the ruins of buildings far more advanced then our own, reduced to burning pieces of rubble.Most of the bodies had been decomposed to nothing, but, we managed to find a preserved corpse.Based on data records that they kept on a database called, the internet, they were called humans.No longer though, they just left ruins, on both planets, apparently called Earth, and Mars.We sifted through the wreckage, trying to find out what happened, and how long it had been.The latter proved fruitless, but we do think we pieced together what happened to them.It wasnt some big war like we initially thought, nor a large meteorite, the atmosphere was fairly heavy on carbon dioxide, but not to an extreme scale such as mass extinction.We did find out what happened, this grand civilization didnt go out with a bang, just a quiet whimper, outside of their control.They were ravaged by a plague, who knows how long ago, seemingly born from a meteorite with alien bacteria.It spread rampantly, infecting 94% of humans, with a 97.8% fatality rate.Their medicine didnt work, we have a record of their last year... its sobering and terrifying to look back on.The true panic and despair they felt collectively as a species as they were all dying to something far, far outside of their control.People thought mars was safe, but people from earth came and brought the plague with them.The humans are no more, but what can we learn from them?What lessons, whats the moral of the story?Frankly I dont know, and Im not sure I want to think on it, any day, everything could be destroyed and you cant do anything about it, is that it?Does anything really matter, or is it all just a sick joke?Because there is only one thing that comes from looking back on the humans, despair.The same despair they felt as a species as time was running out... true and utter despair...
