Floating_Burning
When you die, it as if you are waking from a beautiful, restful sleep.The light is gentle, the shadows are long and there is an easy silence hanging in the air.Many stretch, like they did on those lazy Sunday mornings  reaching out to feel the pulling of muscle, the breath filling their lungs  signs that they exist at least one day more.When you die you have no arms to stretch, no lungs to fill.As you reach out you can feel as if you could go on forever  always grasping for something just beyond your reach.With no eyes do you peer into the endless void  shadows of black and grey shimmer and swirl.There is no point of light on which to focus, no single shape or form to rest your mind.When you die, I am the one to fill that void.I am the outstretched hand that finds yours  grasping, clawing  searching for anything, *anyone*.I am the form that breaks the chaos.Some see me a savior  golden robes, crown of thorns.Others see me a hooded sentinel, my bony hand beckoning.When you die, I bring peace  not to those who are left behind, suffering, dejected and forlorn.No, I bring peace to those that cross the demarcation line between order and eternity.None are left searching, endlessly  for a scrap of humanity of which to cling.When *you* die, I shall be the path you travel  bringing you out of the fog.Call to me, the lighthouse upon the cliffs, and I shall guide you forth.Lost minds and heavy hearts find respite  a mothers embrace to the crying babe.
