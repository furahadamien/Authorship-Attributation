"Wh- who are you?"Jennifer asked.&#x200B;

Jennifer was alone in her kitchen, making some scrambled eggs when she heard *that* voice.When she turned around, there was a little girl standing by the doorway in front of her with blonde hair and a distinctly red ribbon.She looked just like a doll, wearing a pink dress, which made it even creepier as to how unnaturally perfect she looked.&#x200B;

The voice sounded in her head again, an innocent and cheerful voice of a little girl, a voice she has grown all too familiar with all these years."Your friend!I know all about you as I am sure you know.I know about your favorite food, what you think of everyone you've met, and I always know what you want to do."&#x200B;

The combination of the young girl's unmoving mouth and the cheerful voice in Jennifer's head gave her the chills.Jennifer heard the same voice again, but this time it came out of the little girl's mouth."No need to be so scared and anxious!If it makes you feel any better, I can speak through my mouth as well."&#x200B;

Jennifer felt relieved at least, that the girl and the voice were actually the same entity, and that the girl was not just like a dead doll.Jennifer crouched down and grabbed the little girl's shoulder and felt a warm sensation flow through her arm.*She was really here*, Jennifer thought.Initially, Jennifer hoped that this little girl before her was just her seeing things.Now, she was even more weirded out and had even more questions.&#x200B;

The little girl smiled and said, "Of course I am here!I guess you could say I am just as alive as you are."She skipped over to beside Jennifer and hugged her leg, "I am just so glad I finally found you!Also, don't worry, you're not schizophrenic."The little girl affectionately took off her red ribbon and tied it around Jennifer's ankle.&#x200B;

This was the first time today Jennifer saw the little girl act as if she were a little girl.Also, Jennifer felt relieved that she was not schizophrenic.However, as soon as that feeling came up, she quickly dispelled that feeling of relief as she thought, *Leave it to the voice in your head to tell you that you are not schizophrenic.*

&#x200B;

The little girl slowly let go of her leg and sat down cross-legged on the floor.She stared at the floor in concentration, with her brows slightly furrowed, and Jennifer could hear her voice in her head, *Now, how to explain this so she doesn't panic?*

&#x200B;

Jennifer sat down on the floor in front of the little girl and asked, "Explain what?"&#x200B;

The little girl looked at Jennifer and smiled, "Well...I'm your guardian angel."&#x200B;

She smiled wryly and continued, "So I was kinda new to the job and all.Also, I heard some older guardian angels joked around about how easy their job would be if they could just hear the thoughts of the one they were guarding so they could take some precautionary measures."&#x200B;

Jennifer exasperatedly said, "So basically, you did this to me."&#x200B;

Jennifer heard the voice speak in her head frustratedly, *I knew this would happen.Okay, okay.Damage control time.*

&#x200B;

The little girl swayed back and forth and said, "I mean, it was more of an accident if it makes you feel any better.You see, I *miiight* have just found a sealed black book with some glowing eyes on the cover, and it also had a spell to connect us."&#x200B;

Jennifer raised an eyebrow and asked blandly, "Let me guess, there's a catch."&#x200B;

Jennifer suddenly hear the voice scream in her ear, *Damn!She asked about it!* Jennifer winced and quickly covered her ear, glaring at the little girl.&#x200B;

The little girl waved her arms and said, "Ahhh, sorry about that.So, yeah.There is a teeny little small catch.We are kind of linked together.I die when you die and so on.I was not supposed to be able to get an unaging human form that is immortal and stuck at age 7.Furthermore, since I received a human form, I somehow appeared on a random place on Earth."&#x200B;

Jennifer could hear the voice mumble, *I am so glad I did not appear right on top of a volcano.* The girl continued, "So, anyways, once you leave this human plane, I can move on as well!On the bright side, you can be a guardian angel too!"&#x200B;

Jennifer felt her right ankle grow increasingly hot, to the point where it felt like burning.Jennifer tried tugging the red ribbon off, but it seemed as if it was melded together with her leg.Jennifer thought, *What the hell is going on?*

&#x200B;

The little girl laughed cheerfully, "Oh, we're just switching bodies.I found out about this spell in the ominous spell book I used to merge us together initially.I am sure this spell fixes what I have done to merge us beforehand.I am so done with this young body.Did you know you can't buy an airplane ticket at age 7?Why do you think it took me 30 years to get here?"&#x200B;

Jennifer felt her vision grow blurred, and she blacked out.A few moments later, Jennifer opened her eyes and discovered that she was in some village.There were small concrete buildings, each with a small courtyard at the entrance.The roads were all dirt and people rode worn-down bikes instead of cars.The strange thing was that all the buildings and people seemed taller than she was used to.&#x200B;

She glanced at her ankle and found no ribbon to her relief.However, Jennifer's expression distorted once she felt a ribbon on the top of her head.Jennifer eavesdropped and heard the villagers speak in a strange language she has never heard before.&#x200B;

Jennifer thought, *Where the hell am I?*

&#x200B;

She heard a response in her head: The sound of a baby's cries.&#x200B;
