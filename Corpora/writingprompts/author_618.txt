The man sat on the bench, staring out into space.The park was lively, families going about their lives, enjoying the long weekend.He was dressed rather casually, jeans, t-shirt and a blazer, for all intents and purposes, he looked to be a fairly normal 30 something man.It began in a photo in the newspaper of all things, a clash between the superhero Valiant and her nemesis, Hyperion.The article said that their battle flattened a good chunk of the city and that Hyperion was taken into custody, to serve out his sentence in a specialized holding facility.That had been 8 years ago, no one had seen him since.The man rubbed his temple, grimacing.The flashes of memory were coming faster now, bits and pieces of a life that wasn't -his-.Thoughts and ideas of someone who wasn't -him-.But that wasn't right was it?Hyperion was him, just...locked away.The cage wasn't perfect though, there were cracks, the picture just made it worse."I should be angry."he thought, leaning back on the bench, staring at the sky, but the memories he had were...strange, the joy of battle, pain, fear both his own and that which he had instilled in others."I wonder..." he closed his eyes, reaching deep down as he could within himself, seeing if he could reawaken his powers.Somewhere deep inside him, the spark flared back to life.
