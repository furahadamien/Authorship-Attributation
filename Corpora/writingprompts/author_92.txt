The movies were frequently short.Sometimes the merest hint of pinkish light, then claustrophobic discomfort against a thin barrier.Other times, there was daylight from a window as my kin and I spilled out onto a towel.We lay there, drying quickly and dying.Occasionally one of the films would last somewhat longer.I would emerge out into the world for a few brief years before being chased and eaten by some large predator.The different, short films seemed to go on for centuries.Finally, a film I recognized.Mine.My life.

I cried over each small film of barely a month in duration.That feeling of warmth and energy.Of love and growth.And then a chaos, of pain and upheaval.Finally nothing as the egg sluffed off each month from the uterus.Once the egg experienced a joy like no other.There was an external stirring, a coupling and merger with another.Together we grew as one and were born out into the world.As a single entity we were loved, went to school and grew.Then there was a war and we died.And now more new films follow.
