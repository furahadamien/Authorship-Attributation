schaferlite
The devil went to lafayette,
He was lookin for a soul to steal,
He was in a bind, cuz he was way behind,
He was willing to make a deal


When he came across a young man sluggin on a bottle of bathtub gin,
And the devil sat by the moonshine flat, 
and said with a sober grin,


I see you like the liquor, boy, 
And Im a boozehound too,
And if you're feeling thirsty,
Then I'll make a bet with you

I see your livers pickled now,
but before the mornings through,
I'll bet a still of gold
Against your soul,
That I drink more than you

The boy said my names Schafer light,
And that'll be the day,
I let a demon from hell,
Drink me unwell,
So fucker, make your play

Schafer put those mixers down,
and break the blanton out,
Cuz the Devils loose in lafayette and you best drink him down,
and if you win you get the magic still that's made of gold,
But if you lose the devil gets your soul...

Satan grabbed the Devils cut,
And said boy, let me go first,
Cuz hell is hot as Texas,
and I feel a mighty thirst

Red sparks flew from the stopper
As he poured out his first sip,
And steam came from the cursed glass,
As it touched his fiery lips

When the devil finished drinking,
and he held the bottle dry,
Schafer smirked and grabbed a handle,
Said "you puss, try this for size"

Couple ah drinks boys, pour them out,
Schafers gonna knock em down
Devils facedown on the ground,
Schafer said just one more round!When the devil woke that afternoon,
He knew his time had come, 
Cuz Schafer light can drink all night,
But the prince of dark was done

And he gave the magic moonshine still,
To the boy with the curly hair,
An Schafer said "rematch tonight?"But the devil won't be there

He met his liquor match that day,
Down south of Abbeville,
and Schafer still brews liquor now,
With the Devils golden still
