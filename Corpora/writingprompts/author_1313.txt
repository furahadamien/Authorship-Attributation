The sounds and smells of New York assaulted John's senses.After being gone from the city for 10 years, he still love/hated the smell of New York City in the summer.It was dark on the street.Darker than a street should seem.Looking up he noticed the lights had been busted out on the light pole.He heard a soft *John* behind him and he turned.She had gotten her hair cut.He couldn't tell the color but it looked like she'd gone back to being a brunette.He always did have a thing for brunettes.He smiled."Hey.Fancy meeting you here."She surged forward and hugged him fiercely.She had grown taller than him years ago, but he couldn't begrudge her that.Even as a kid she'd been all legs.She was slim again."I can't believe your here!"She cried with tears in her voice."Yeah I'm here.How longs it been?""Almost four years now.Johnny is about to turn four in a few weeks.""Wow.He's getting big.I can hug you now with no baby bump."She laughed remembering the last time he'd come to her.She'd gone into labor unexpectedly and was alone without her cell phone nearby.Their reunion, however, was cut short by a shout from the end of the block."Ay lady!That kid botherin' ya?""No."She shouted back."He's with me!""A'ight.I noticed those bums trynna follow ya but I sen em off."Said a gruff Italian walking towards the pair."Oh goodness.Thank you so much.I thought I had shaken them off and then when I realized I hadn't I was just all turned around."She responded, her hand on her chest.*ah* thought John.*That's why I'm here* 

"Yeah, fageddaboudit.Look, yous gotta be careful in the Bronx.You can't be out here at night with just a kid keeping you company, ya know what I'm sayin.Those bums tried telling me some stuff but I told em to tell their story walkin."John stuck out his hand."Hey man, thanks a lot for that.I didn't realize she'd attracted some unwanted attention.I'm gonna get her home safe now."The Italian shook his hand back and said, "Yeah, you do dat son.Go on up to White Plains Road.See if you can catch a cab.Don't be taking ya moms on no subways round here, ya hear?Yous guys get home safe, a'ight.""Will do, sir."John responded with a respectful nod.The pair turned and walked up the road towards the tell tale screeching of a subway car stopping towards where the man had pointed.They walked in silence for a moment."I'm not sure how I feel about being mistaken for your mother now."They shared a good laugh before lapsing into silence.As they neared the busy, populated street they both slowed.For a few moments they just watched the people passing.John loved how alive the scene in front of them was."Even with as much as it's changed, it's still the same."She smiled wistfully, watching his face.Her eyes seemed intent on taking in every facial expression of his.He meet her gaze with that youthful grin she'd fallen in love with as a kid.He noticed the lines on her face.No doubt some put there by his namesake.Some by grief she'd experienced.And the rest by time.Time that he'd lost."It's good to see you again."she whispered.He grinned even wider."It's good to be seen!"He didn't want to see the tears in her eyes that he knew were inevitable.She should always be smiling.She was safe now and he could feel himself fading again."You tell your boy I said hey.Take care of yourself...Mom."She huffed through her tears and stared as her once childhood love faded from sight with that eternal boyish grin.Even though he'd been gone for 10 years, the grief was always fresh.But it was accompanied by the comfort that her guardian angel was still watching over her.Edit: Spelling.Did this on my phone.
