The problem with humans is their curiosity.Even after a new species from the stars reigns hell upon every continent, impaling billions on the ends of their spears, curiosity still prevails.When enough people finally lay dead in the streets the survivors came to a realization.Every time someone died it allowed a little more magic to flow through the human race's veins.Bringing us back to the plight and pillar of humanity, curiosity.Or more specifically the curiosity of one Oleg Bishopi, Ph.D. and the charming young girl just waking up among the piles of medical equipment and samples strewn across his basement."Wonderful" The Doctor cheered through a thick accent, "We can begin"

"Mmmph" responded the girl through tightly wrapped bandages.Her eyes were wide with fear, something restraining her neck forcing her gaze to the ceiling.She tried to move her legs and felt something entirely new.She attempted to kick her leg and instead felt four legs react.Each one longer than they should be.She tried the other to the same response, only on the other side."Your name is Platythomisus Sapien and I am your father" The Doctor stated.The girl looked at him for a moment, searching for some piece of information to cling onto.An immediate feeling in her chest told her opposite.A moment in time flashed through her mind, cheap birthday streamers clinging to the walls, a handmade lopsided cake, and her father.A tall man in a light green button down, his brown hand on her shoulder with a smile behind his thick mustache.She opened her eyes again, the man in front of her was not her father.His skin was akin to snow, and he had the figure of a beer bottle.He wore a light blue coat that reached his ankles with an apron over top, slick with blood.Thick rubber gloves clung to his hand."You'll notice the improvements" He smiled, gesturing towards her lower half.She jerked against the instrument around her neck.The doctor made a small noise as if just remembering her restraints.He paced over to her and placed a gloved hand around her neck, the other behind her.She heard a click, and suddenly her head was free.She stared down.Her stomach was bare.Her eyes crept down to her waistline, where her skin abruptly became a sickening yellow.Her legs were gone, instead, a large mass took their place.The yellow mass held large black dots across it.Eight spindling legs stretched out with three joints each.At the second joint the leg shifted to a jet black.She screamed."Silence, girl" The doctor commanded.She did not quiet.She flailed her many legs and ripped at her own waist, trying to break free.The doctor stumbled backward.She tore off the restraint at her neck.The doctor began to scramble through his desk.The girl shoved a hand into her waist, amazed at her own strength.Hot blood trickled onto her new arachnid bottom.She pushed hard, a ripping pain seared through her.She screamed louder.The doctor retrieved a needle and thrust it into a nearby bottle."I SAID SILENCE!"He cried back.She grabbed the back of his neck with her bloodied hand.She slammed him into the cement wall.The sound of snapping bones rang out."Why" She grunted, holding her other hand against her fresh wound."You already had the magic" He began, trying to pull his head free from the cement."You could summon spiders.This was just an experi-"

The girl pushed him harder.Another cracking sound, she dropped the limp body.She stared back down at herself.A disgusting body covered in blood.The crimson was starting to dry across the bright yellow legs.Her heart sank when she looked down at the man.*Did I mean to?*, she asked herself.It felt like a weight on a hook, dragging her stomach into the floor.She clenched her fists and felt hot tears stream down her face.She leaned on to the wall and sobbed.Her legs seemed to adjust by themselves, almost on instinct.The adrenaline slowly ebbed away as she sank to the floor, more blood smearing across the cement into a floor drain at the center of the room.A light flashed into the room as the one metal door swung open.A boy stepped through, a rifle in his hands prodding the room.He glanced down and yelled out.The girl could hear footsteps down the hall.An older man, a greying beard framing his face, stepped through holding a pistol.His eyes went wide at the sight before him.He turned away for a moment to look at the boy, who in turn was unable to take his eyes off the girl attached to such a horrific abomination.Both seemed too shaken to act.Finally, the boy walked over, gun still firmly in hand.He grabbed the light blue coat hanging off the doctor's corpse and handed it to the girl.She pulled it around her torso and looked down at her wound.The boy almost jumped back."Dad" He said "We need to take her to the medicine men"

The newspaper clipping showed a thin man in a yellow trench coat.Upon his head was an unnervingly accurate bee helmet.Small mandibles where his mouth should be.Long thin antenna jutting from his forehead.I placed a finger on the photo.The man stood on the steps of the First World Bank.A shotgun held firmly in one hand, a strange yellow device in the other.The caption printed underneath in faded black letters.*David B. Billards, aka Ph.D. Pollen, seen moments before apprehension by Mister Memory*

My stomach dropped.Reading the same name that sat on my license caused me to stagger.I placed the paper back into the box.My heart was pounding hard against my chest.Nothing seemed to break my trance, not the cool air as I stepped out of the shed, not the smile of my wife sitting on the back porch."Did you find your dads drill, sweetie?"she asked from the table, cutting into a biscuit with a small butter knife."Did you know?"I asked, hoisting myself onto the wooden deck.She stayed seated, careful not to get any butter on her yellow sundress.Her soft brown hair was up in a hive cut.She placed her food down and looked up at me."Did I know w-"

"DID YOU KNOW WHO I WAS?"I screamed slamming my hands on the table.Her tea crashed to the floor, shattering the glass.She gasped and recoiled in her chair."What are you talking about?"She whimpered, tears forming in her eyes.I grabbed the jar of honey from the table and shoved it in her face."I WAS A VILLAIN, A GODDAMN VILLAIN" I yelled "YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME"

"W-what do you mean" She sobbed.I threw the jar at the shed.More glass scattering into the yard.She screamed.Neighbors began to peer through windows and investigating the noise.She kept asking what I meant.My muscles kept clenching.Unending tension rising in my neck.I hit her.She almost fell from her seat.*I hit her*.I quickly stepped forward, my hands open."I'm sorry," I said, my face was burning red.I took another step.She thrust at me with the butter knife.The dull silver slammed into my palm.She threw herself from the chair and ran.I held my own now bleeding palm.Neighbors stared at me, one with a camera, the other with a phone to his ear.I staggered into the kitchen.On any other day, it would have smelled of bacon and eggs.I pulled gauze from the cabinet, wincing as all sorts of cold and allergy medicines tumbled out.I winced, yanking the knife from my own hand.The bandages clung tight to my shaking hand.I slowly changed clothes, being cautious not to spill any blood on another button up.*Driving is out of the question*, I thought looking down at my hand.I stumbled onto the street.A few neighbors glanced in my direction but quickly turned away.I made my way to the bus stop.Police sirens wailed in the distance.The black and white car could be seen prowling through the neighboorhood, lights blinking.I shoved my hand into my pocket, the fabric around it forcing a wince out of me.A small drop of blood began to bleed through.The car crept closer.Two cops, both talking on a radio and urgently checking house numbers.I sat on the curb, putting my knees to hide the crowing dark crimson stain.The car stopped in front of me.A large officer behind the wheel rolled his window down.I could see myself in the reflection of his sunglasses.His massive yellow mustache shook when he spoke."How far down is 1112?"he boomed.I used my right hand and pointed back to my own house."Thanks," he said.The tinted window lazily rolled up.The car rolled down towards the house.I let out a hard breath.The police car parked in the driveway.*Shit*, I thought, *the front door is wide open*.I stood up and started walking.Next bus stop was only a few blocks down.---

The morning air was still cool when I stepped off the bus.In front of me was a plethora of chain stores brimming with people.My leather wallet, luckily, was still in my back pocket.A few people shot me puzzled glances; hiding my hand was futile.I entered a toy shop towards the end of the outdoor strip mall.The interior was completely illuminated by harsh artificial light.Rows upon rows of neon plastic shapes lined the walls.Early Christmas shoppers were out en masse.I picked up a *DARF* gun, a yellow and black shotgun model for young kids to blast each other with.I put it under my arm and made my way to the costume section.A few out-of-date Halloween costumes clung to the back of the shelves.A single Mister Memory mask was on a worn out hook.I threw the mask over the side of the shelf with a curse.A small "Bubbly the Bee" mask caught my eye.Its wide cartoonish eyes were a light blue with a fake glisten of light in them.Instead of intimidating mandibles, it wore a large pink smile.I snatched it up and took both items to the cashier.The girl manning the register was dressed in teal.She looked at me with an even stranger look than the bus driver."They share birthdays."I smiled, handing her a ten.I stepped back onto the busy streets.People pushed and shoved their ways to get the best deals that were really no different from the normal prices.After picking up a trenchcoat and some yellow spray paint, the plan could be executed.I ducked into an alley, supplies in hand.I sprayed the jacket down a bright wet yellow.It stuck to the cheap imitation leather in streaky drips.I took the gun and began to grind off the obvious DARF gun logo."Uh, h-hey," 

I spun around clenching the toy firearm.The girl in teal, a cigarette in her hand."I know you did some bad things but-" She explained "I'm a big fan.None of the heroes even listened to you.""Do you know what happened to me?"I asked, clenching a fist."Well yeah," she said holding her hands behind her back "Everyone saw it"

My cheeks went red.Imagining everyone able to see Mister Memory lobotomizing me sent a wave of embarrassment across my face."What are you gonna do?"She asked, half pointing to my scratched up DARF gun."I'm going to get my research back."I boldly stated, putting my chin up."With that?"She asked."What other choice do I have?"I said, dropping the gun.She stood there in front of me, just looking at me.She took another drag and put out her cigarette."Come with me," she said.---

We sat in the parking lot of the police department.The string on the cheap mask was tight around my head.The yellow jacket I made was stiff from where the paint dried, with a few wet spots on the pockets and inside.I kept my hand tight on the real gun she bought me on our excursion across town.She gave me a peck on the cheek through cheap plastic."I'll keep the car on across the street."She explained, "If you get your stuff it should be easy enough to just walk out.""Thank you," I told her, pushing open the car door and wincing at the pain in my hand.I looked back at her once, the sun just went down across the suburban horizon.I walked towards the glass doors, legs slowing with each step.*What's pushing you?* I could hear in the back of my head, *That's not you anymore*.I held the handle tighter.I could feel something click.A slight twitch began in my eye."For the bees," I grunted.I slammed the entrance open.A tattooed teenage cuffed to a chair screamed at the sight of me, then started hysterically laughing.A cop was still at his desk.His eyes were wide, he slowly sat his coffee down."Pick it back up," I demanded.He complied, keeping his other hand in plain sight."Evidence locker," I barked, he gestured his mug to a back room."No," I said thrusting the pistol towards him "You go, I'll follow"

The pudgy cop slowly lifted himself up.I could see his holster on the desk.I followed closely behind as he made his way down a hall."Hey Gene" I heard a man say to my hostage.I pointed the gun over *Gene's* shoulder.Again, I saw myself in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses.A blonde mustache wiggled nervously at the sight of a gun barrel."Well," he said putting his hands up, "Gene you wanna take the night off?""If you wouldn't mind, sir," Gene said."You wanna let Gene go home to his wife, sir?"The other officer asked."You think I'm that dumb?"I said, "I have a Ph.D."

The cop pushed Gene into a wall.He threw himself at me.I fired.A bit of drywall was shot into the air.A fist connected with my mask.I felt the bottom half of the plastic crinkle and snap.He had me on my back, pummeling my face.The ring on his finger breaking up my mask and nose.I hit him hard on the side.He slammed down with both hands.My head was throbbing."Come on *Bee Brains*," The officer screamed, "Use that degree of yours"

The officer grabbed my sidearm off the ground.He began to eye it down, checking the chamber and safety."You know I never really liked that memory stealing sap.The only way to really put down a mask is with a goddamn bullet."He laughed.He slowly stood up, gun trained on my head.I placed my arms on my chest in pain.The officer kept laughing at me.Blood trickled onto my mask and back in my mouth.I put my hands into my jacket."You people make me sick," He said

I yanked out the spray paint, finger hard on the nozzle.A wide smear of yellow streaked across his open mouth and sunglasses.I rolled, a bullet flying past my ear.He fired wildly into the walls.Gene made a break for the fire exit.I kicked the officer hard in the shin.He hit the carpeted floor face first.I rolled on top of him, taking his head in both my hands."What's going on?"The teenager yelled from his seat in the back.I ignored him, slamming the man's head into the floor repeatedly.The sound of his mirrored glasses cracking was muffled by the carpet.I slowly got up, grabbing my gun from his limp fingers.I spit a mixture of saliva and blood on his back.The evidence room was clearly marked, and the door, surprisingly, unlocked.(PART 1)

My own truck was stuttering across the interstate.The vehicle had been aging about as well as milk.The blue paint on its sides peeled up to reveal the primary stages of rust.A few layers of bumper stickers on the back spouted views I really didn't care for, those I spray painted over.But for all of the aesthetical shortcomings the car retained two real pieces of value, it works and it was cheap.Bought off some dingy looking lot next to an Arby's.The dealer was friendly at least, gave me an "Off-the-books" discount.Every time he said the words he talked a mile a minute, the straight lace side of him clashing with the compassion.Maybe once the clunker gave its last wheezing breath I'd go back, but not till then.No, this car was mine and goddammit did it work.Maybe the best part about it was the radio.A dinosaur in comparison to any other on the road, yet the thin muffled static made each song feel a little more real.Each tune off of *William White's Western Whistlers* was almost haunting through the dusted speakers.The age of the tune was only matched by my leather jacket.The black material warmed to a great extent by the sun.Whoever stole a glance at my rustic truck and I would swear we had come straight off an album cover.I kept rolling across the cross country stretch of asphalt.Watching the iron railing appear and disappear with the hills and tree lines.A cascade of cars went around me through the fast lane.I'd take a glance at each one, getting any scrap of personality I could about the people who passed me.It was almost a game at this point.Turns out the most impatient people are the ones with the little metal fish, *weird*.I watched as a white sedan began to drive past.For a moment our cars were neck and neck, two-ton racehorses steaming across the track.My curiosity got the best of me.I took a glance to the left.A red-haired woman sat behind the wheel, hands gripped firmly on it.I looked back into my own lane.Her car swerved as if it were a toy being flicked.It hit my rear, hard.I was horizontal to the road.The deafening horn of a truck.My neck jerked.The floor shifted.Through the raining glass, I saw the road, no railing.The car floated for a moment.The truck smashed through the hill.My torso wedged halfway out of the seatbelt.Warm blood dripped across my forehead.I felt the car give one final rock and opened my eyes.The grass was above me.The seatbelt dug hard into my leg and stomach.It snapped.My back hit the roof of the car, shattered glass scratching through my jacket.Smoke drifted through the open windows, the clunker gave out.I put one arm forward, shards of glass shifted with me.I gripped hard on the frame and pulled.My stomach stung with each inch until my torso hit the grass.My head was spinning.The forest seemed to get darker.*Play the guitar; Play it again, my Johnny*

I opened my eyes.My legs were pulsing.I was awake, but the forest was getting darker.I could hardly see the tree line twenty feet ahead.The blue sky was a murky veil of ink.I kept pulling myself across the grass.The blindness continued approaching me.Shadow blanketed me for a brief moment.A spotlight blared upon me.The light was not warm, almost stale.The same kind of light flashed into your eyes in the dentist chair.akin to the middle school play auditions, blinding light, and a freezing, painful sweat.I tried to look up, to find the source.A creaking sound echoed just beyond the light's radius.A stench rolled upon the dirt, a horrifying smell that dared not lift to the sky.The smell of rot.I tried to look back to the clunker, only the faint sound of the radio could be heard.*What if you go, What if you stay, I love you*

The creaking persisted.I looked ahead but it came from each angle.The sound of ancient trees splintering.The tip of a bone planted itself ahead of me.A face came into light, a paper-thin layer of rotting skin clung to the sharp skull.Its head was the size of the truck's cab.Hollow cave-like eyes stared through me.An animal tilting it's head in curiosity.The skeletal hand slid closer through the earth."Please no," I croaked, my throat was dry.*What if you're cruel, you can be kind I know*

It crept closer.The hand was the size of the truck bed.Massive fingers ready to prod.The top of the torso peered through the darkness, rusting iron armor hung upon its chest.It raised the hand and opened its mouth.Blackened teeth were set deep into the jaw.The stench was unbearable.*There was never a man like my Johnny,*

*Like the one they call Johnny Guitar.*

I felt the hot breath trickle out of its open nose.I almost invited the warmth.The light was unrelenting.A heavy hand was lifted into the air.The still grass below waved gently with it.A shadow fell across me.Another faint sound filled the clearing, just muffled by the radio.A woman.Her voice from just beyond the darkness.The skull slowly turned.Hollow eyes searching into nothing.I heard the voice again, a woman.*Play it again*

I saw the sky.*Johnny Guitar*
