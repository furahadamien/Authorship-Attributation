"An army marches on its stomach"  

The plump, balding man was dwarfed beneath the titans of asgard; yet his stance was solid."and so for a spear to thrust, so then a spatula must first have been thrust 'neath an egg."An unsure glance was shared around the counsel."Stories of fantastic battles are shared amongst beer and cod; great warriors roaring and boasting between mouthfuls."Said the little man, still clutching his weaponry and growing with confidence."Heimdall, I doubt keeping watch over Asgard is bearable without constant snacks," Carl addressed the golden eyed watcher.He was given a slow nod in response."Thor has been known to eats farms before battle and complain worse about a missed meal than an open gash in his side!"A few members looked toward the empty seat which usually held the God of ~~Hammers~~ Thunder.Murmur and chuckles of agreement were had."Great Odin, more wars have been won with my weapon than with yours, I'd challenge you to wage one without this."Carl raised his stainless steel spatula and looked straight into the eye of the Allfather, unable to read his face."...I might add I've swatted hundreds of flies with this in my kitchen so the kill count is technically pretty high..."

A loud hearty laugh filled the hall as the Allfather hooted and banged on the table in front of him."Carl Carlson, your case has been made clear.I have never and *will* never begin battle without  a weapon for slaying my hunger.Enjoy Valhalla!"roared Odin with the entire counsel smiling as the giant gates opened for the tiny cook.
