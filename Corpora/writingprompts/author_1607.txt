Was it all just a dream?For weeks now, the same question has been taunting me, flooding my mind to the beat of my pacing steps.Though, weeks mean nothing now.There are no numbers to count the days, months, years, as they flow by.No one seems to care, either.I am surrounded with primates who cannot think beyond what they know.They do not question our very existence as I do, nor do they wonder what could happen next.Eat, sleep, survive.Reproduce.Die.They know nothing of the future I saw.Was it real?I can feel the memories slip away as if it were just another figment of my imagination.But how could it be, with all its details and complexities?One mind cannot imagine such a society on its own, can it?I am losing part after part of the knowledge I had with every passing second, as my primate mind seems to take over, erasing the thoughts of this universe, slipping through my fingers like sand.I no longer remember what the excitement of learning something new feels like, nor do I recall the empowerment of being part of a crowd, of a community.They know nothing of adversity, of sadness, of happiness, of guilt, of greed.They are missing as much good as bad.Was it all just a dream?
