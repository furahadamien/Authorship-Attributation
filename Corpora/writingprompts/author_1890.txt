The day I arrived I thought I was just reborn, I felt so much more alive!I felt like I finally had energy again, just like in my twentys.I looked around as there was quite a lot of chatter in the room I had just entered.There were many people sitting at seperate tables, just like a highschool lunchroom.Anyway, I took a glance around the room to see if I recognized anyone, to my surprise, I saw Albert Einstien along with many famous physists all dicussing some topic I didnt understand.I decided that I did not want to impede on their converstion, so I glanced at more people in the room.There were everyday men and women who sat uneasily near a large set of doors, there was Beethoven and Bach, there was Shakespear, and off in the way back, far from any other table, sat Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin.
