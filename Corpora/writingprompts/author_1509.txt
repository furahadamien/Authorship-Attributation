He should have known this by now.The loud shriek of his alarm clock had pierced through his slumber, but sleep hadn't given up yet.Still half asleep he turned around to slam his alarm clock.&#x200B;

Nothing happened.&#x200B;

He opened his eyes and with a groan he suddenly rememberd that his right forearm was no longer there.Why did it still feel so real even after losing it in an accident a year ago?And why did he not think to look for a room where he could put his night stand on the other side of his bed, so it would be easier to use his left arm to shut it down?&#x200B;

He turned on the light and got out of bed to get ready for work.It was cold and damp in the room.Winter had just started, accompanied with the first of the fog spells.His arm always felt particularly real on days like this, it almost felt like he could touch something.Luckily the pain had gone by now; last winter was hell because his arm still felt like it was healing.&#x200B;

After getting dressed, he put on his arm prosthesis.Even after using it for almost a year, it still felt wrong.He had used it because it helped him fit in, but suddenly he couldn't stand wearing such a dead, plastic thing while his phantom forearm felt so real.With a sigh he put it in his backpack.He could always put it on again at work, but for today he would set out without it.&#x200B;

It was an incredible relief to be able to swing his arm around while walking to work, or at least have the feeling that he could.His prosthesis was always in a fixed position in front of him with his arm bent at he elbow, so it really restricted his forearm movements.Of course there were more complicated arm protheses, but they were more expensive.And to be honest, he didn't really need it: he was sidelined at his job.He used to use his strong arms as a construction worker, proudly building and restoring homes for the people in his neighbourhood.Why had he acted on impulse when that wall came down?He had pulled his colleague and friend out of the way, but his arm got crushed instead.As thanks they gave him an administrative job at the same construction firm, but how could he be any good at that when he could barely write legible with his left hand?It was humiliating, but he had no choice.Where else would they take on a crippled construction worker?He was thankful for the opportunity, but it didn't make him happy.He missed working with stone and mortar, feeling the power of his hands shaping a new home.He had always liked working with his hands, so he had never bothered pursuing the type of education that could have landed him a better job in his current situation.&#x200B;

By the time he had finished ruminating, he had ended up on the main street.It chilled him to see the Ghost Guard with their black and silver uniform out for the first time this winter.Ghost always came out in the dark and they were especially strong in the fog.They were attracted to life and warmth, so they tended to congregate wherever people gathered.The strongest ones could even drain a person's life force.A normal person couldn't do anything against them.Only special people on the boundary between life and death could touch and potentially harm a ghost, so the Ghost Guard was both revered and feared.They patrolled the main streets in winter, because a crowded street full of "prey" rushing to work and school was almost irresistible to the life leechers.They were rare, but not rare enough to feel safe in the dark without protection nearby.Luckily ghosts can't enter buildings without a human's permission, otherwise even the Ghost Guard wouldn't be enough to keep everyone safe.&#x200B;

He kept walking and was about to turn off main street, when suddenly he heard two loud shrieks: a high pitched child's voice accompanied by a woman's.He turned around and saw a little girl getting attacked by a life leecher, her mother trying but failing to protect her.The child's rosy cheeks, so full of life were turning paler by the minute as the bluish white transparent ghost wrapped around her.The ghost didn't even look scary: to a completely ignorant bystander it may have even looked like the ghost was gently hugging her.The girl's face said otherwise though, spurring him to action.He blanked out, completely forgetting any consequences for himself, ran towards the girl and punched the ghost away from her.By the time he had realized he was swinging his non-existent right fist it was too late.Horrified, he watched in slow motion as his arm stump was about to swing past the ghost, not even realizing that he wouldn't have been able to touch the ghost anyway, when suddenly he felt a *connection*.His phantom fist connected with the ghost and turned visible in the same transparent bluish white color as the ghost.His fist and forearm glowed and left white lightning-like tracks as the life leecher was pushed away from the girl.&#x200B;

Exhausted, amazed and horrified he stared at his ghostly forearm, while the Ghost Guard rushed in to bind the life leecher and the girl was taken care of by her mother.&#x200B;

Afterwards, one of the Ghost Guards came up to him."That was very brave what you did there.This life leecher was exceptionally strong and fast, so you probably saved that girl's life.If you hadn't acted, we would have been too late.It seems like you have what it takes to be a Ghost Guard, would you be interesting in joining us?"Stupified, he could only stare at the Ghost Guard."I'm not sure I wasn't thinking I'm not" he mumbled."The appearance of your arm says otherwise," the Guard said with a knowing smile."Think it over, I'll give you my card.The orientation for new recruits happens to be tomorrow at 9 'o clock in the morning at our headquarters, please come if you decide to join us.Oh, and please don't go to work today with your arm like that, you'll need to learn to camouflage it if you don't want to scare everyone.We can help you with that at headquarters."&#x200B;

Still shocked he watched the Guards walk away to continue their round, a firm determination forming in his mind to take this new opportunity with both hands.One year ago his impulse to save a life had ended his life as he knew it, but that same impulse had also presented him with an opportunity to build a new life today.Maybe the loss of his right forearm would turn out to be a good thing in the end, allowing him to help keep others safe in a way he had never imagined before?Filled with hope he turned around to walk back home, his phantom arm finally truly swinging at his side.
