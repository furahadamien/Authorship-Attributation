"At last, I have found you!Your reign of terror ends now!Prepare yourself for yo- Agh!"The sound of a bullet piercing through yet another so called 'hero' is one that I seem to hear almost regularly.The look of utter shock in their righteous faces, as they crumble to the ground doesn't haunt me as much as it used to when I started in this shit.They never considered that I would be so.... tasteless.Sure, it does seem fitting that I let them deliver their speech or give one of my own when I have them tied up in my warehouse, but all of it is just so... inefficient.So theatrical.Even when I'm executing hostages when they have lost their purpose to me, it just doesn't make sense to ramble.Why waste words on ears that will hear for the last time?It's much easier to put on between their eyes, now isn't it?It is probably this thought process of mine, that has led to the 2 mil bounty on my head.Ah well, as long as they keep the speeches coming, they'll find killing me quite the task.And so, as I hear the sounds of my henchmen being slaughtered one by one violently, a somewhat frequent occurrence given the incomoeti of my crew, I sigh deeply and await my new 'rival'.Leaning on my desk, I watch the body of my office guard fly across the doorway, riddled with holes.A bald man in a suit enters my office his dual Barettas pointed squarely at me.Unfazed, I close my eyes looking down, expecting the oh so familiar half confident ramble, as I place my hands in the desk behind me.I was greeted instead by two sharp piercing pains in my abdomen, forcing my eyes open in surprise and shock.His steely glare was agonizing even more.Feeling my stomach, I look at my hands, now coated with my own blood.I couldn't help but smile.This should be interesting.
