**So this got a little away from me and doesn't exactly follow the prompt but I already wrote it so I'm going to post it and you guys can read or not**

Rampage claws at his neck, the air, at nothing at all.Nothing to grab onto but still he claws desperately.His entire body convulses, legs kicking desperately against the scorched blacktop.His neck popps softly as it continues to stretch, millimeter by millimeter, his head being pulled further from his shoulders like honey falling up."While I understand your eagerness, young hero, I also understand that you are over eager.Over eager and over confident.Both can be tempered, I suppose, in time however time is a luxury you simply do not have."The Tempest strolls around the gasping would be hero."I find it sad that so few youths cannot seem to understand that in this business their lack of knowledge could kill them any moment.You have heard of me, yes?You do understand what you have stepped into, do you not?Sad that you will not be able to learn from the experience."The Tempest continues to stroll along the street, casually avoiding smoldering rubble.Plumes of smoke rise from the still burning building where Rampage had tried to ambush him.It had been laughably easy to see coming and even easier to stop."They say all good things come to an end; it follows that mediocre things come to an end...quicker.""Tempest!Picking on kids I see?What's the matter, can't handle a real super hero?"The Tempest whirls, lips pulled back in a snarl.There he is, just like he always showed up over the decades, standing there without a care in the world.Just as he'd always kept his suit immaculate his loafers are spotless despite the street.Crisp slacks and a lint rolled vest.His cane even shined in the sunlight.He may be retired but he is certainly not slovenly."The boy had the gall to interrupt me.I was just doing him the courtesy of relieving him of his head."They both hear Rampage's sharp gasp as his neck pops again."Why, do you think you can do something about it, old man?""We both know I can."The old man's voice comes from over The Tempest's left shoulder; he's still fast."I need you to release him."The Tempest spins in a crouch, shooting both arms straight out.The old man flies back as if hit by a wrecking ball.He hits the very edge of the crumbling wall and jackknifes wildly through the air into the building, out of sight.The Tempest smirks and turns back to Rampage."Now, where were w-"

The Tempest's head snaps around, his body struggling to spin fast enough to keep his head on his shoulders.He spins around several times before falling to the ground.Dazed, he simply stares at the sky, working his jaw slowly.Rampage suddenly draws in a deep breath, sucking air like a man who just found an oasis in the desert.He looks up to see the old man, his clothing torn in places, stained in others, standing over him."Go, you've no place here.Try not to overstep yourself again."The old man's eyes are hard and unforgiving.Rampage struggles to his feet and runs, leaving the old man staring coldly down at the stunned super villain.Soon he's out of sight.The air is still as the two regard each other amid the chaos.Far off sirens break the silence."Do you think he'll learn?"The old man offers The Tempest a hand to help him up."He seems like he'll get the message."The super villain accepts the help climbing to his feet."He will or he won't, we've done our part," The Tempest works his jaw, flinching slightly "you certainly don't pull punches, even now.I didn't hurt you did I?I did cushion you from the wall."The old man stretched."You did.You also ripped my slacks.Watch for word, I hear there's a young man a few cities over named Impact.Could probably do with a life lesson before he gets to a big city.""I will."The Tempest sighed, but the old man was nowhere to be seen.
