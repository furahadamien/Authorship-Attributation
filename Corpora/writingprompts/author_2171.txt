The old hero let out his last breath and died.Standing over his deathbed, his arch nemesis remained calm.His eyes stared into the still face of the hero.They had fought each other for twenty years and the nemesis never could have pictured this end.He turned on a heel and walked out of the hospital room where he took out a cellphone and dialed a number.It rang three times before there was a voice at the other end of the line."How did you get this number?""It doesn't matter.I'm calling to let you know he's dead."There was a long pause on the other end of the line."I've been here for two days," the villain continued, "and no one from the Guild came.I thought you all lived by that stupid Code you all blabber about?""I don't have to listen to a villain lecture me on our morals!We were busy keeping the world safe from the likes of you!""Yes, I'm a villain.I've done terrible things for money and revenge.But after today that's over.My greatest enemy didn't die because I knifed him in a fight, or stole his powers.He died of cancer.And apparently, that was not a fight the Guild wanted anything to do with.I came when I learned.We had a long talk and I'm hanging up the gloves.""I don't believe you.You're plotting something.""I don't care.I'm going to disappear down a hole so dark you'll never find me.And anyway, none of the rest of you are as good as him.He was the best.Even out of that ridiculous suit of his he lived a noble life.In it, he was more worthy of respect than anyone I can think of.Good bye."The villain hung up and looked at the phone in disgust.He sat on a bench along the hall way and looked at the sterile hospital wall.Slowly, his head sunk into his hands, and he began to weep.-----
