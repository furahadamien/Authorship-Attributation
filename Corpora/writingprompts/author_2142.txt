The first time, he had been scared and horrified of what he had done.He believed the voice was simply a delusion he had created to distract from the real issue: the dead man lying at his feet.In a panic, Jack hauled the body into the trunk of his car and buried him outside of town.He had a family after all, his kids needed him.He couldn't go to jail for this.After a good shower to wash off the dirt and blood, a few panic attacks, and almost turning himself into the police from the guilt, Jack had finally calmed down and tried to forget the events of that night.The next day, Jack was awoken by his eldest son."Hey dad...I think there's something wrong with the sink."That was the day Jack learned he was a plumber.Without a single hiccup, Jack easily repaired the sink.He had never been particularly good at plumbing and yet...

His mind drifted back to the night before.THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE JACK OF ALL TRADES

------

Three years had passed since that night.Now, artist, gardener, writer, pilot, doctor, plumber, and welder Jack sat in the living room.Not a single sound came from within the house aside from Jack's slow breathing.Amy had taken the kids years ago when Jack tried to tell her what was happening.He tried to tell her.He could still remember the horrified look on her face when he told her about the wreck.The nightmares.The voice.She fled faster than he'd seen some of his Jacks run.It was a miracle she didn't report him to the police.Not that he cared.Amy wasn't a Jack.He felt no interest in her anymore.Jack sat on the edge of the couch, waiting, listening until the telltale sound of a car approaching the driveway met his ears, followed by the car door shutting.After Plumber Jack and a later somewhat accidental Doctor Jack-- Jack had admitted himself into a hospital on a temporary lapse in judgement, then panicked when Doctor Jack had attempted to keep him there, lashing out in fear-- Jack now knew all about The Game of Jacks.For every Jack he killed, he would gain their knowledge of the world, along with their skills.Jack stood as he heard the person on the other side of the door fumbling with their keys.All Jacks knew of the game.It was kill or be killed, and Jack always struck first, before The Jacks could do anything to him.The Jacks were deceptive, skilled.Often, they'd be perfectly capable of blending in, acting like a normal citizen, but Jack knew.Every Jack knew.So when a new neighbor moved in, announcing to all that he was a Jack, Jack knew he had to do something before New Jack moved in for the kill.Jack was usually meticulous about The Jacks, careful to do research on a New Jack's skills and life.Working to ensure that he left no evidence, but this was different.This New Jack was close, able to attack him when he wasn't prepared.Jack had to be a bit reckless for once.Which was why he was waiting in New Jack's living room for New Jack to come home from his late shift at work.The front door opened with a click and Jack grinned at the New Jack that walked freely into the percieved dark safety of his own home.Jack briefly wondered what sort of knowledge this Jack held and what kind of exciting fun was to be had at the misery of his death.Jack had learn to enjoy the kills, and he never got caught.After all, he was Jack: artist, gardener, writer, pilot, programmer, musician, doctor, plumber, welder, knife collector, blood enthusiast, hunter, and serial killer.The Jack of All Trades.Jack stifled a maniacal chuckle as New Jack met with the end of his knife and Jack was given a new title to add to his list: A Friendly Neighbor.
