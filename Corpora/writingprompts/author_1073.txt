It was around my twelfth birthday, my father had just gotten back from the bar, he smelt of absinthe and cigarettes.He was angry, mum was at work she was working another night shift at the hospital, he always thought she was cheating but it was that day he snapped.He started smoking a cigarette on the sofa, he coughed awkwardly he always held the smoke in a bit to long like he was trying to suck every cent he spent on that cigarette.I hate my father and it was evident he hated me too, his beady eyes always looked through me never at me.I coughed quietly and tried to remind him that mum didn't like it when he smoked in the living room.He lunged at me his lit cigarette burnt the corner of my eye, I screamed he didn't like that he raised his hand and then brought it down swiftly his ring hit me on the side of the temple.The last I saw of my father was him running out the front door.I woke up in a hospital bed to see my neighbour Janet holding my hand, "Hey there champion, are you feeling better?"she muttered softly.Janet was a beautiful woman, she was in her mid twenties, she was short with curly brown hair and had a style that remind you slightly of a grandma, I don't think I ever saw her without a floral pattern."I've felt better Janet."I said a bit too harshly.My eye stung and I was wearing a gown "Which hospital am I at?", "You're at St. Christopher's, your mother is still on shift."She said even softer this time.And then in she came.My mother.She walked in and looked at me through those windows she called glasses, they obstructed her face just enough, I couldn't tell even she was smiling or frowning.Her robotic voice echoed around in the small room "Hello; Damian it seems your father was a bit too rough last night."she spoke unnaturally she paused for a bit too long between words.That when I first saw it the lines, a green one led right out of the room while a red one led to my mother.I got up removed the equipment stuck in me and walked out of the door.My mum said nothing she was probably happy, I had always caused her more trouble than I was worth.The line led out of the hospital and took me a couple of miles down the street, it led to an old house with a fiat punto parked outside it, I knocked on the door there was no answer for a couple of seconds, then there was a muffled crash a man aged about thirty answered the door he had messy ginger hair and an attractiveness that was hard to place.He smiled, then frowned, then exclaimed in horror "What happened to you?Why are your feet all bloody?"I tried my best to explain while I was standing in his doorway.He name was David, he was my adoptive father in the years to come, he was a phd candidate in computer science when we first met he specialized in machine learning.He taught me the best he could and after about ten years I had graduated from Oxford with a first, the career I had after graduation was cushy.The lines were always present in my life, thanks to my first experience I had assumed that red meant negative outcome green meant positive.Until one day after work I decided to venture down the red line, I had run into Janet she was working behind a till at a petrol station she looked tired, I told her about the things that happened to me.She begged me to meet David, I happily agreed dad hadn't had a girlfriend since he adopted me.They got tremendously.This was a red line nothing bad had happened, it got me thinking, why did mother have a red line?And why were there only ever two?
