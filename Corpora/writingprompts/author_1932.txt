I cannot believe what I just saw.The man standing before me, straight out of a video game with his smug grin, chiseled features and fancy costume, spun his gun around his index finger before swiftly and easily placing it back into its holster.My mouth fixed agape, still staring at the pathetic... wallet creature?"Wha- what, what was that" I barely spit out."You wouldn't believe me if I told you" he said, casually walking into the dark from whence he came.The poor creature smoldering from the inside out begins turning to ash.All fear quickly fleeing my mind.As the flood of questions pour in I begin to follow him toward the open street ahead."Seriously, what in the fuck just happened?What about my credit cards?My ID!My-".The man stops abruptly to my surprise and it seemed to his as well."Ya, know..." He pauses and turns around slowly."I think I can help you.That there little friend you've had nestled to your right ass cheek is not your wallet.That's what me and my friends call a Scrimp.It was biologically engineered by team of scientists from China."He leans in closer and his voice gets softer, as if to not let anyone overhear."Now, a Scrimp can be used for a lot of purposes and take the form of, well almost anything, but only once.That one just so happened to take the form of your wallet.Now I have no idea why, how or where it did this but, if you want to find your actual wallet, we are going to need to do some back tracking and of course, I'll help" he says as he puffs up his chest and exposes a shit eating grin."So kid.Where is the last place you had your wallet out of your pocket?"Trying to make sense of exactly what the hell is going on it took me a second to think.Where did I last use my wallet.Starbucks?That was early this morning.The bodega down the block from my house?No I havent been there in days."Oh shit" I said aloud, breaking  what seemed to be a dead silence."I remember...I used it at Cheetahs.""What the hell is Cheetahs?"the stranger asks."It's a club.Well kind of like a club.Like a gentlemens club."I say softly.After a short pause and moment of realization, "A STRIP CLUB" he bolsters with excitement."Woooooo weeee doggy.Here I was thinking you were some introverted nerd" he says as he looks me up and down, "and you're a real man after all!"He wraps his arm over the top of my shoulders and begins walking, pulling me along."What does a guy like you go to a titty bar for?Lap dances right?Oh no, I know, this is one of those real seedy joints right?Blow jobs!"he says, gaining excitement with every assumption."Well kid.What is it?"He says after a short laugh."Definitely the blow jobs."I didnt know how to end this but thanks for reading it.I'm going to bed.
