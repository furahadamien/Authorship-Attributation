Most people dream of being rich.The kind of life where every day worries like bills, mortgages and making sure your kids go to the "right" schools and good colleges are non existent.They think that is the life, one of leisure and indulgence.&#x200B;

How little do they know.&#x200B;

They never stop and think beyond, think of what to DO with their lives besides escaping the drudgery.Don't think that now you can have everything with no work, what keeps you motivated to keep going?There is only so much indulging you can do before you end up bored or dead.So naive, thinking their relationships won't change or that people will treat them the same, that they'll be the same.And that people would try to use you for their own devious means 

&#x200B;

These were things more forebears worked out hundreds of years ago.See, my family was RICH.How rich?Well think of anything and we could buy it, control it and remake it as we saw fit.I mean ANYTHING.&#x200B;

Let's try it.Look around and tell me what you see.TV?Did you mean the manufacturing of them or the entire televised entertainment industry?Like it mattered, we could own both with our pocket change.Mobile phones?We could control the tech and make Nokia the top again, could make or destroy any app at will, easier than snapping your fingers.We could build or destroy entire countries, Hell, entire *religions* for fun.Do you know *how* much money it would take to do that?More than you could count in a lifetime.More than you could fathom.And that was less than half a percent of what we had.&#x200B;

So they came up with rules, simple rules, to keep us safe from the world and the world safe from us.Passed down from generation to generation that were to be obeyed at all costs as cousin Jack found out.&#x200B;

**Rule 1:** You were not to use your family name, secret position or your inherited wealth flippantly.None of this "Don't you know who I am?"crap or buying and selling things for fun or annoyance.You could only pull it only with what you had made or earned yourself.&#x200B;

So Uncle Herb, who had earned his way into a C Suite position at a major tech company?Yeah.he had his own wealth and reputation and could say it if her chose.Cousin Jack, the drop kick son from his second wife?He tried to pull it in high school after getting rejected for both a starting position in the football team and a date with the hottest girl in school.Financially cut off, barred from contacting any of us again on pain of death and taken away to God knows where.&#x200B;

**Rule 2:** You were to attend at LEAST 2 years in a public high school then could transfer to private.The family seemed to learn two very different lessons from this.Either "Don't become this" or "Understand your fellow man, and these will be your best friends."&#x200B;

**Rule 3:** Immediately upon graduating high school we were to have a gap year fully funded by our familial wealth.We could do what we wanted, go where we wanted, bring our friends if we liked.A year to indulge or experience anything and everything.To get it out of our systems in a way that would be unlikely to raise eyebrows.&#x200B;

**Rule 4:** Upon completion of College or Trade School we were given 1 million to start and last us for life.No more public hand outs.And only if within a year we complied with Rule 5, otherwise we had to pay it back.&#x200B;

**Rule 5:** We had to work out in the real world.Start at the bottom, earn our way up.Get an idea of how work was supposed to function ... or not.&#x200B;

**Rule 6**  You could tell only your children about your legacy on their 15 birthday, to pass the knowledge down to them, to prepare them, to train them.&#x200B;

Not everyone in the family reacted the same.Some decided to live the life of rich jet setting socialites, always chasing summer with equally shallow friends and hangers on, never amounting to or doing much and finding themselves dissatisfied and alone.Some decided to live life ordinary, work normal jobs and even face "normal worries", refusing the family money for anything other than emergencies and education.And some who wanted to make it in the world themselves, that craved the spotlight and not hiding in the shadows.&#x200B;

And then there was me.I lived a comfortable life.I still saw my friends from school and college often.They knew my "parents were wealthy and owned my apartment" (it explained the fancy fit out, great location and no flatmates)  but besides that expected me to make it on my own.The reality is I chose to work because it gave me motivation.I liked being able to relate to my friends and have something to bitch about at happy hour.&#x200B;

We frequently debated what type of bad boss was the worst.They were convinced a jerk elevated to power, no matter how slight, was the worst.I disagreed.They remembered and *knew* their power could be taken away and were careful to wield it so it wouldn't get taken away.I argued the worst was one born into power, who has never seen the work behind it.It was their divine right and they knew nothing else.&#x200B;

I was, sadly, proven right.&#x200B;

My direct supervisor was a real Karen type.Liked to drop work on us last minute, time our breaks down to the second and be a real pain in the ass.Annoying but sad.My best friend, Amy also worked under her and we'd both roll our eyes and get on with it.&#x200B;

The real problem was the new division supervisor.Chet.or "Chet Harrington, MBA.Harrington like the Company President."As he introduced himself and he was every bit as wanky and pretentious as his first name suggested.He hit on every female under 30,  defered to the 20 year old male intern, frequently asked us to get him coffee, do his filing and other tasks not even close to what we did.Not to crap on office support workers, they are the back bone of a good company, but what would I as a IT help desk tech know about filing or photocopies?&#x200B;

But the straw that broke the camels back?A promotion came up for team lead under Karen but still a step up.I applied.It would have looked weird not to as one of the most senior people there.Chet interviewed myself and Dale, another tech for the position.Nothing against Dale, he's a great guy.But my interview was being held after his on a Friday afternoon.&#x200B;

Dale didn't step out of the office until 5:37pm, long after everyone else had left.We did support for banks and other 9-5 businesses so had no need to stay outside those hours normally.Just Chet and myself in his office.The questions quickly turned from work related to personal to "OMG, Lawsuit!".&#x200B;

He wanted me to sleep with him.He did not want to take no for an answer so instead got a slap and a knee to the balls.&#x200B;

"You little bitch!Don't you know who I am?You're going to regret this.You are FIRED and I'll personally make sure no-one ever hires you for ANYTHING again."&#x200B;

It sounds like a plan, Chet.It sounds like a plan.
