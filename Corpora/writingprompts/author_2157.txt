The old man sat on the park bench alone, pondering the actions that had brought him to this point in his life.The sacrifices of never having a family, never being able to fall in love for fear of enemies.He had given his youth, life,  and soul to protecting humanity and, this is how they repayed him?They had cast him out, he was now a burden.45 years ago he had still been somewhat in his prime, his super strength,speed and damn near invincibility, had made him one of the first real superheroes.He had saved the pope from capture by Orion  (albeit their battle had destroyed half the vatican) He had saved the president from Dreadnot and his henchmen on multiple occasions.He had stopped an all out nuclear war in the 80's perpetrated by sintax.Yet he sat here, alone, forgotten..
  How he wished to be able to go back to the way things were, his muscle and speed had left him years ago.Now, he was frail, weak and, sadly he admitted to himself that he had no will to live anymore.what was the point?His purpose in life was gone.As he felt the vast emptiness that was now his life, he started to weep.A hand touched his shoulder, " General Powers, on behalf of the villains league, myself, Dreadnot, Sintax would be greatly honored if, you could take us down the the police station for one last booking."The General wiped his eyes and hugged his mortal enemy/dearest friend.He was not forgotten, He was not alone.Eh, not too sure about this, first time ever responce
