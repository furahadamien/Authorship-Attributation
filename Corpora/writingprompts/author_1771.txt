What if I told you there once lived men who could lift automobiles using only their breath?Almighty beings that ate metal slabs for breakfast, who covered their bodies with hieroglyphs, purposely inflicting pain upon themselves just because they could.What if I told you these creatures walked the earth, like you and me?Would you believe it, or not?Children, let me tell you the story of Guinness the Great and the world before the surge.Back then, life wasn't about survival.The scab rats hadn't hatched yet, so it was fairly safe on this planet.We prospered and created meaning for our own lives, which went into an unexpected direction.Everyone wanted to be noticed.Atop his golden throne, Guinness the Great held a competition of champions.He called upon the strangest and strongest, the weirdest and wildest to compete for a chance to be noticed.As expected, millions and millions of them arrived at Guinness's doorstep, all begging for his blessing.He snapped his fingers and they all filed into a line, stretching around the earth five times.One by one, they presented themselves to his holiness, and if their talent was deemed worthy, he would invite them to be immortalized in his book and turned into a god.Guinness the Great wasn't known for patience, so those who showed no promise were thrown into a pit of lava, their corpses turned to ash.This judgement went on for a hundred years, until one man rose above it.He saw the tyranny in Guinness the Great's ways and wanted to stop it, at all costs.He arrived at Guinness's doorstep, where he was told to bow.He did not.Again, he was commanded.Again, he withheld.Guinness was intrigued by the valor, so he gave the man a chance to redeem himself.The man stood up straight and spit onto the very ground he walked on.He said these are no gods.No.Only men.Men who have dedicated their entire lives to these niche talents, and the disrespect will not stand.Guinness glared at him, offering no remorse.Not anymore.As he prepared to banish the man to the pits of lava, the man smiled.He dared Guinness to do it.He said he cannot die.The fate of this man is not written in the sacred texts as it is unknown to the population.But I know.I know what happened.He sucked in his gut and swam through the lava where he found refuge in a cave.For six years, he subsisted off of rats and rat blood.It wasn't until a fire breather drifted ashore that he was able to escape.Together, the two men stormed into Guinness the Great's lair and challenged him, inciting a war that would last another 20 years or so.The humans were too distracted with records and challenges that they didn't even realize when the scab rats and the mammoth fleas hatched.The man who dared challenge Guinness is long gone now, but a quote etched in stone remains."There are no gods, only man."- Ripley
