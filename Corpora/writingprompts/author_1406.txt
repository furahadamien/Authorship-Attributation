It was a weird thing, to be born.I remember it being the purest, best feeling.I was conceived at the first bacterium, a wisp smaller than the cell that squirmed forth.My first memory, and my true birth, was at the creation of Eve, and the breaking of Adam's rib.When God created each new life, every new child under his two creations, I felt a holy pull towards the Earth.I felt a pull towards each human, towards every dancing breath and work of art that nature spun.It was a weird thing to be reborn as death.That first culling was also to change me, and God knew my first touch after death was to be the love of my life.It took whatever good I felt and tore it out in cruel lobotomy.And then, pleasure.Sweet sweet pleasure at the memory that could never be sullied and the sweetest relief.Sweet sweet relief, and sweet pleasure turned to lust.And when the flood came, avarice.I loved killing.The souls became a leisure to take.I swept the grains and became powerful, and everywhere.With millions of people I was a God.My mind reached far, far into the future.I could predict the final destination of any being, small or large, and soon after I became able to cause it.I spent millennia carving rocks and moving seas, all to cause distant catastrophes.I set up wars and watched civilizations burn each other with inventions I helped create.My scythe never stopped swinging.When there became billions of people, I had a grand idea, the best in many years.I was going to depopulate.And so I did.And I fell in love with a new art.There was Deus ex Machina, and even more deliberate, me.I gave them a free year, too.Just to watch the symphony unfold.And then it all happened.Not just one war, but dozens.Disease.Mania.A machinery so precise that every bullet fired was a kill.I watched the natural floods and the man-made wildfires meet and my ears danced at the sound of the screams.Pure ecstasy.*Cough*

What.. was that?*Coughgck*

...Blood?The rush snapped out and I felt it.Every death.Every scream.I felt tangible.I was no longer everywhere and I was AFRAID.What is happening?*HckCoffCougjjh*

I forgot what it felt like to feel a single death.India, 23 years old.Suresh Patil.I could feel the fear as he was pushed and I could feel the sound his head made when it met the pavement.I could feel the loss of beauty.****

Four years ago, and now there were 526..

253 of them are on remote islands, or faraway places.They will have no chance, no matter what I do.But I still watch.I am forced to watch them as they travel hundreds of miles on nothing but bugs and will, knowing exactly when they will die.As I take their hand, I will apologize.113 in a town.They chose to call it "Miracle", a place untouched by death.But really, it was I who created it.My knowledge was the only thing that hasn't yet left, and I knew how to play with causality.I painted smells in the trees that would draw the animals, of which the men would follow.I diverted rivers and made them flow to this town on the sea.I created an earthquake to separate it from the wild ocean but still allow for fish.The 160 others have all but gone mad.I am afraid of them, for they have started to see me.They look behind them when I am there and they share my pain.All but a handful have the same delusion - they call me life.I know why.I whisper in birds' ears to lead them to shelter, food, whatever.I've had to beg, but I've gotten the squirrels to drop blankets near the cold.God has not spoken, so I have taken his place.****
12 years.Miracle is a misnomer.There are now more effigies of me than there are humans.There are 32 effigies.They have almost given up, but they know that I am near.The noises on my ears are now prayers and not screams.It's nice.I have no regrets.I have led them as far as I can, and scavenged every burnt store and ghost town alongside them.They talk directly to me sometimes, and although they can't hear me I do answer.I am no longer a single being, in one place, but multiplicitous in the hearts of the few that are left.I have begin to orchestrate events far into the future again.I do my best, but I am still getting weaker.I look down and there are only hands and a scythe.I find myself kneeling down and reaping another.They won't last long, and neither will I.****

I have done everything I can.I have orchestrated every opportunity, recruited every beast and insect, put light in every path to go.There are two now, a man and a woman.Or rather, two and a child.Their time is limited.From all of my efforts, they will have five months after the child is born.They have both become sick, but don't know it yet.When I approach, they become as terrified as I am."Life," the one asks, her hand thumbing a small carving of a snake on a cross, "Why were we chosen to live?"They were not.I am not a God.Mother Nature was Queen, and her fates spun that they both could live the longest.They were not 'chosen' to live."You were chosen to die," I whisper.I hate the monster they called death.****

I have named him.The one sole survivor of this beautiful, reforming world.Every fiber of my being goes into protecting this small boy.I have sent him teachings of the past, of good and bad, and of the future he could have.I love this boy.I won't last to see him grow, but at last I can be patient.He is older now.Seven years.I'm unsure if he understands why, but he knows that everything works for him in this world.I am on my last legs, but finally, I have that feeling back.I felt a pull towards him.I felt the beauty in his every footstep and the sheer awesomeness of nature's golden thread.My memories flushed back from my birth and I remembered what my Father had done for me.I went to Adam, afraid and alone, and while he slept I took a rib.With my scythe, the only part of me left, I cut it in two.I created Eve, and my son.A part of me that would last beyond this and be willing to be a part of the beautiful world to come.Good luck, you three.I love you.
