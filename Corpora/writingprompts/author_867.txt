So, as it turns out, Heaven and Hell are the same place.And a war sort of destroyed both of them, leaving nothing but an apocalyptic, anarchy-ridden wasteland.I drive through the destroyed landscape that was once Heaven, barely managing to avoid the various holes in the clouds.Jesus, Satan and Buddha are all in the car with me - I stumbled upon them by chance, saved their lives, and now we're working to repair the afterlife."Jesus.See any Rogue Angels?"I ask, turning towards Christ.He's looking through the holes in his hands, using them like some sort of telescope.Maybe they actually do function like that.I never asked.I don't like looking at them for too long."No sign of them, but I doubt they've decided to leave us alone now," he confirms, but he continues looking.He's been paranoid since I found him.Maybe something's up.Satan smokes a cigarette, blowing the smoke in my face."Ugh, how many times have I asked you to stop smoking?!Jesus Christ!"I snap."What?"Jesus asks, confused.I then cover my mouth with one hand immediately, continuing to steer with the other hand.This is the first time I've actually snapped at my companions - they all have their faults, but I've always been polite about it.Until now, that is.**"What did you just say?"** Satan asks, narrowing his fiery red eyes.I immediately regret what I just said."...S-shit, sorry-"

The Devil merely laughs.**"I've been wondering how long it would take you to actually stick up for yourself!"** I calm down a bit.He doesn't seem mad - then again, sometimes it's hard to tell with him.He pats me on the back - a bit forcefully, but then again, everything he does is forceful.He tosses the cigarette out of the semi truck with his other hand."Did you really have to throw it onto the clouds?"Buddha argues."You could start a fire or something."**"This place is already absolutely destroyed.Doesn't matter."**

"Yeah, but that could-" I'm interrupted by the sounds of blades being drawn.Jesus quickly turns, seeing a large group of demons, armed with swords of varying sized.After a few seconds of silence, the son of God speaks."Draw in an ambush.""Jesus Christ.""What?"
