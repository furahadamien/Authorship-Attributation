"Wait a minute," the demon's voice grew softer, "I recognized that book.Are you one of Trisha's friends?"A bit puzzled, you manage to stammer, "Th-this book belonged to my grandmother, Patricia Zimmer.I inherited her house last week and found this book of recipes in the attic.""I knew this day would come," the demon shook his head as he spoke, "but tell me, where is your mother?I always assumed she would be the successor.""My mother died when I very young."Your voice wavers a little as you speak, "Grandma always said it was an accident.""I'm sorry to hear that," he takes a step forward."I only met her once, but I could tell she had a passion for the Dark Arts."Horrified by what the demon had just said, you throw the book on the floor and rush out of the house.As you slam the door behind you, the demon calls out, "You can't run from your destiny.I'll be right here when you are ready to embrace it."You open the door to your mid-sized sedan and place the key in the ignition.Out of the corner of your eye, you spy a book in the passenger seat - it's the same book you had thrown on the floor of the kitchen just moments ago.Your hands shake as you pick it up and on the inside cover you find a note handwritten by your grandmother, "Don't believe his lies or you'll end up with the same fate as your mother!"
