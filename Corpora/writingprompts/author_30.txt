The instant the spinning stopped, Bob found himself thrown to the floor in a Judo throw.As he lay there stunned, Bob watched an axe kick flying towards his midsection.Rolling out of the way in the nick of time, splinters covered him as Hitler's heel crashed through his easel."Another would be assassin hmm?Know this my foe, I have killed dozens of your devious kind before and I've gotten very good at it" said Hitler as adopted a martial stance.Bob stood up and shook himself free of the residual effects of the time travel effect and shards of wood.He'd only wanted to show the would be dictator the pleasures of painting, not get killed in hand to hand combat.Well that was fine by him.As Bob took his own stance, he challenged Adolf, "Herr Hitler, my name is Bob Ross, former USAF Master Sergeant.And you best believe, chairforce or not, I'm going to knock some sense into your head"

And so began the greatest artist beatdown in history.
