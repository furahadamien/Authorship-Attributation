I had always heard her voice.No matter what the dose of medication, experimental treatment -- she was always there.In High School, through college.Shit, when I lost my first tooth.Doctors said I had schizophrenia, it was all in my head.That's where I usually heard her anyway, so it made enough sense.But this time was different.The sound of her voice didn't come from inside.It was external.It scared the shit out of me to be honest, like a tray falling over at a restaurant.Startled, I didn't recognize it at first.I turned around quickly and saw a woman my age."Did you say something?""Who me?""Yeah you.Also how did you get in here, no public entry allowed back here."She was a few inches shorter than me.Wearing a sundress, white flip-flops, and tapping her phone nervously between her fingers."I'm not the public"

"Wait, do I...do I know you?"I was shitting bricks at this point.I hadn't pinpointed the specific place I knew her from, but I knew it was off.It's like seeing a late night show live at a taping.It's real, but it's all a little unreal.Something that has lived in your mind intangibly suddenly whole, and real, and close enough to touch.It's like Mickey Mouse coming round with the Jehova's Witnesses.Bad explanation but you'd piss yourself if it happened."Of course you do, we've been talking for 37 years.""I'm sorry ma'am, but you're going to have to leave" I say getting progressively more freaked out."Oh relax dude, it's me" 

I jump a little bit, that voice came from my head.My eyes get real fuckin' wide."Sorry, I know this is weird, I just thought it was time we met"

Okay, the real girl said that one."What are you talking about?Who are you?""Oh yeah, uh, well I'm Kristen" she said with an uncomfortable wave "and uh, well I'm also an ESP"

"A what?""An ESP, like, I can communicate telepathically like you.""You can communicate telepathically?I can communicate telepathically?""Uhh, yeah man.We've been talking for 37 years.We share a birthday, and we've been in sync for a long time now.I tried to tell you the doctors were wrong, but you went and told them I said that so they upped the dosage.Haven't you wondered why that didn't work?""You're fucking with me.""I'm not"

"Okay, so I'm going to th"

"You're going to think something and you want me to repeat it back verbatim to you to prove that I can actually hear your thoughts.You were going to think "Applesauce".""What the actual fuck.""Yeah, it's real.So anyway, I wanted to find you in person and see if there was any value in getting to know each other better in a more tangible way, like as physically present human beings rather than voices in each others' heads.""Are you asking me on a date?""No.Just looking to be close friends.""Oh okay.
