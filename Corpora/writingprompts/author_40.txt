As I sat in my darkened bedroom, with only the ghostly glow of my computer screen and the click-clack of my keyboard for company.I scan through the news feeds, searching for anything thatll pique my interest, then I see it.Americans continue to fight for net neutrality I murmured the headline to myself.Then it dawned on me, theyd been fighting it for twenty years, whilst the rest of the world carried on, with free access to the internet.The little voice in my head commented still dont give a fuck.And so I carried on with my life, like the other 95.7% of the world.
