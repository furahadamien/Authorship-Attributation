Never settling, my mind sprints away from me 
Imaginative they'd call me 
But I have never been convinced.Creativity is not swirling inside me 
It's darker in the depths of my mind 

At first it was the presence of the ideas that scared me
The thought to lie
The thought to steal or cheat without a blink
about it
But that's not really me 
So I began to question who I was becoming 

Suddenly the thoughts manifested into words
From a voice that used my mouth to speak 
But this voice wasn't me or who I wanted to be
Yet I couldn't control him from speaking what he was really thinking 

I tried to hush the noise by eliminating silence 
Though the more I push him out the darker my eyes have gotten.I think he's getting stronger maybe taking over me 
I'm blacking out for moments 
Last night I was gone for twenty
Twenty minutes of lost time 
I awoke in my car having previously been doing the dishes.I couldn't contain my horror what could he make me do?That night I did some research
On the web I gathered that I might be schizophrenic 
Oh course this would happen to me 
I chuckled inspite of my self--another freeloader
Laugter turned to mania and he told me to go to bed 
That he would make everything okay

I don't know why I listen but I had been looking for some silence so I let my mind be at ease
What is wrong with me I thought as I drifted off to sleep.I don't know who I'm becoming

I woke up in a daze but everything seemed peaceful.Maybe I had dreamed it all 
I decided to believe that and go about my day 
It was so pleasant to be ignorant until I saw the letter addressed to me.I dropped much quicker than I picked it up.It's in my handwriting.Stiller than a statue, I let myself breathe.I mustered up some courage and had a look inside..Attached to 500 dollars there was a note that read.This shall be fun.
