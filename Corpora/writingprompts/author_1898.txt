I would say that I seen him as soon as I walked through the door, but purgatory doesnt work like that.Purgatory is like a dream.You don't wake up, you don't enter the room... All the sudden you're just there.He was the first person I noticed when I came into consciousness.A miserable look on his face, surrounded by clearly unsavory characters.There were so many people I wanted to meet in the afterlife.My grandpa, Kurt Kobain, maybe even Sitting Bull.I wanted to meet my idols but from the moment I laid eyes on this man my curiosity grew and grew.It would be one thing if I looked at him and he had been happy surrounded by his followers but I could tell immediately that he was full of sorrow.I began to approach him.Then I stopped, I looked around and seen so many worth while people.Some that I recognized from tv, movies and books.Some that I didn't.Many of whom I would be honored to meet, but I couldn't resist.I started walking again and approached the crowd around him.They all stopped talking and stared at me, I clearly had no business being there.While they were pale faced I on the other hand had tan skin with dark features.See, in purgatory nobody can hurt you.You're already dead and nobody can physically harm you.Those are the rules.Nonetheless I began to feel extremely uncomfortable, frightened even.I took one step back and then another, all the while everyone in the room had stopped what they were doing and began staring at me.Just as I was about to hightail it out of there he looked up and nodded.He told his followers to let me through and then he told me to have a seat.I was speechless, I was angry, I didn't have the slightest clue what to say.We sat across from eachother and looked into eachothers eyes for I don't know how long.Finally, I couldn't take it anymore.I had to say something, anything but what?What could I say to a man who's actions effected the world in such a way, even long after his death?I took a deep breath in and prepared to say something, prepared to scream and yell and make a scene but before I could exhale he spoke."I'm sorry"
What?!What do I say to that?How am I suppose to react?I sat there in silence trying to gather my thoughts but my brain was scrambled.What am I doing here?I should have just went on to meet someone I looked up to like everyone else, now it's too late to back down."Sorry for what?"I say."Sorry for everything"
He goes on to tell me about the mistakes he made in life, how he felt he was doing the right thing.Mostly he told me about how he feels now.How his hatred for others turned into hatred for himself in purgatory.At first, he said, it was great.He loved all of the attention he was receiving, how people revered him.But as time went on he began to hate it.He began to hate all the people who passed through and gave him praise he knew he didn't deserve.I listened to him for what may have been hours or what may have been days, theres not much of a sense of time here in purgatory.When he finally finishes talking I stand up to excuse myself.He asks if I would stay with him.Even after hearing everything he had to say I feel no sympathy, I simply say
"Fuck you Hitler."
