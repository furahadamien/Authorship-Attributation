"What the fuck is that even supposed to mean?"I asked through the incessant   buzzing of my portal, "How could people be different colours?""Raj," Yorrick continued, "You were born well after the fall of Ganymede.I don't --"

"Ganymede?""It's a moon from the first system.It's where you'll have to go to talk to him.""I thought we came from a planet?""We did, it was also in the first system.Stop interrupting me.""Well you're not making any sense.""Well just listen!He'll be on a planet called Earth in a city called Jerusalem.My brother can take you there.Earth should be right where we are--"

"Is that who we're waiting for?""Raja!""Sorry.""Earth was massive.Much much larger than the drifter ships you come from.People grew up in wildly different climates and it made their skin different colours.""Like blue and green?""No.Like black and white and brown.""I'm brown.""You're beige.""White would be creepy.""I'm white.""What?No you're not you're like... a weird pink.""You're young.I don't expect you to understand.""I'm 9!""In drifter years.You're only around 16 on Earth.""Well that's even more.""No it isn't.""You Eternals make no sense.No wonder you all died off.""Ya well your people are way worse.Here he comes.""Where?""You won't be able to see him yet."A small noise filled my ears.I looked to Yorrick for any clue as to what was going on.The noise flourished, and became something of a voice.His expression quickly shifted from concentration to panic as the sounds grew louder still."Something's wrong."He yelled over the now deafening roar in the air, "he's going to hit us!""What do we do?"I asked."Stay there, I'm getting in.""What?!No!""Raja, Move!"I jumped out of the way while Yorrick forced his way through the portal."Push the button!"He screamed.There was a blinding flash of yellow light, followed by a boom so loud I could feel it, but didn't hear anything.We were both blown back.There was suddenly gravity.The ground was soft and malleable, and incredibly hot.I felt like I'd been punched in the face."What the fuck happened?"I wondered aloud as I opened my eyes.The light was blinding."He crashed."Yorrick sat up."Your brother?Is he OK?""I have no idea.And we're here.""On Earth?"I sat up.We were sitting on top of a hill, looking out onto city that looked like it was made of the dirt it sat in."Yes.""Why is it so fucking hot?""Our sun was pretty intense."I grabbed a handful of whatever was on the ground."Where are we?What is this?""The desert.It's called sand.We have to find Josh.""What's he look like?""I've never met him.""You've never met him?!What the hell?This is the whole reason they sent me to you!""I know, I'm sorry!We needed my brother.""Well can't we find him somewhere.He didn't come through with us?""No.He wouldn't be here now either.He always stayed in Canada in this era.""What's Canada?""Shut the fuck up, Raja.""Yorrick!""Oh grow up.And that's not my name when we're here."There was a noise behind us.We spun around to see a woman.She was beautiful, and terrified."Holy shit that's her."Yorrick whispered."Who?The eternal?""No.We came back too far.""Well what the hell are we supposed to do now?"Yorrick stepped towards the woman.She in turn stepped back."No, no.Mary don't be afraid."He said to her, as calm as I'd ever heard him speak, "I'm Gabriel.You should probably sit down for this."
