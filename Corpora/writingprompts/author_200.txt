It returned as quickly as it was taken away.I wasnt prepared for it, and now rather than being blinded by darkness, I was blinded by bright light.I stumbled backwards and fell to my knees, my hands gripping the brick wall behind me.I closed my tearing eyes and blinked slowly, trying to get readjusted to the light.Two years ago The Darkness came.I had been cutting tomatoes for my wife, Jane, who was sauting vegetables when the world went black.I cried out, blinking furiously, my hands clawing at my face.I heard a similar cry behind me.Ben, Ben, I cant see!Somethings wrong, I cant see!

Jane, I cant either.We need to call for help, something happened.

I groped around for the phone.I didnt even know where it was, but I needed to keep my hands busy.It had to be on the counter somewhere.And thats when I heard Jane scream.She must have burned herself on the frying pan, or knocked it over, but her shrieks still haunt me to this day.When I did find a phone, I couldnt get an ambulance, we couldnt even contact the police.A busy line greeted us.This didnt just happen to us.It happened to everyone.And with the worlds sight being gone, for some reason sounds we had grown accustom to went away as well.The busy New York City streets were now quiet, the happy chatter that filled the park across from us was silent.We now lived in a blind and muted world.We treated Janes burns with ice and carried through the motions of our old life.Before the TV stations went dark, they would bring on people who had suddenly went blind before The Darkness.They said that it was something that they got used to and eventually they learned how to continue living on with their lives.But either they were lying or had a support system that we couldnt get because life for us was terrible.We ran out of food within a month and began making trips to a near by bodega to pick up whatever we could.When we arrived, people were fighting over the last few frozen meals.We got what we could, but I left with a bruised face and Janes arm was cut by a knife.We began venturing further from home to find the things we needed to survive, but a year ago, we got lost and we havent been able to find out way back home.We sleep when we find a soft place, we eat when we find food, and we barely survive.But now I blinked and there was an outline.I blinked again and there was now faded color.I blinked a third time and saw my wife, hunched over, picking out her ragged hair, and staring at nothing.Jane, I said, my eyes still tearing from the sting of the sun, but unwilling to blink again at fear that it would all go away.I stared at her.Her skin was gray and scarred with burns and cuts, her clothes filthy, her bones prominent, and nails long and broken.Jane! I said, more loudly this time.She rose her head slowly, her blue eyes looking to the left of me.My voice cracked, I rarely spoke above a whisper in the past few months.There was no need to.I think I can I trailed off, barely believing it, convinced it was an illusion or a cruel trick.I think I can

And then something caught my eye.The building behind my haggard wife.Thick black letters formed a sentence.It took me a little time before I understood what it meant as reading had been a lost luxury for us.DONT TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE!Thats when I began to look around.It wasnt just on that one wall, it was everywhere, big and small.Like a crazed graffiti artist had made the city his own but only had one thing to say.Whose them?I look at the people around me.We were in an alley way accompanied by three other people.A man who looked like he was about to begin urinating and sang softly to himself, a woman napping on a piece of cardboard, and a second man talking softly to the wall.My story wasnt unique.I had heard many similar ones over the past two years; people who couldnt find their families, others like us who couldnt find their way home.Some who had gone days without food.There were fights, rapes, theft, murder, and so many horrible things we never thought would happen in our city.The world had become lawless.And we were trying to not become its victims.Yes? Jane whispered, her head bobbed up to face mine, guided by my voice.I think I can I looked back at the thick black warning surrounding me and back at my wife.Whoever had written them must have been as crazed as the man who had now begun peeing to the right of me as he sang the alphabet backwards.I think I can see.

I thought the world had gone quiet when The Darkness began, but in the moment I knew what true silence was.The peeing man stopped urinating and singing, the napping woman stopped snoring, and muttering man silenced.Janes face was directly facing mine now.Only her unfocused blue eyes told me that she was still blind.You can see? She asked, her hoarse voice cracking.She reached out her hand and found my face.Yes, I whispered, my tears from the sun now turning into tears of happiness.I can see.I can see.I can now help us.I can see.

She came closer and put her other hand on my face.I didnt realize how much I had missed when Jane cradled my face in her hands, the heat of her palms warming my cheek.She wiped away a tear with her thumb.I need your eyes, she said.I will be your eyes, I will always be your eyes. I said.I sniffed back the snot that was beginning to flow from my nose.Her hands moved from my cheeks next to my eyes.She traced a finger over my eyelid, a broken nail lightly scratching the soft skin.I need your eyes, she said again, this time more loudly.She began to press her fingers lightly around my eye sockets.Thats when movement around me caught my eye.The three other people in the alley with us had risen to their feet and had formed a circle around me and my wife.Panic rose in my chest.Jane, we need to get out of here, I whispered, placing my hand on her arm.I went to push her hand off my face, but she tightened her grip.Ouch! I gasped, her fingers pressed further into my eyes.Stop! I pushed her off of me.What do you think youre doing?!

Animal like, Jane leaped back at me, pushing me over from my knees onto my back.I NEED YOU EYES! she screamed.I pushed her off me again, but another hand shot out and grabbed my shoulder.It was the man who seconds ago was peeing next to me.She needs your eyes, he said as he stared over me.She needs your eyes, the others began to whisper.We need your eyes, I need your eyes, need to get your eyes.

Another hand reached out pinning my other arm, my leg, my torso.I can help you!I can help all of you! I screamed, thrashing and kicking, but their hands wouldnt move.Jane peered over me, her face leaned down to meet my own and for a second I thought she was going to kiss me.Ben, she whispered, one hand on my cheek, the other stroking my temple.For a second, her blue eyes locked onto my own.I need your eyes.
