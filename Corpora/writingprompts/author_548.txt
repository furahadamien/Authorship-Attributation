It was mayhem."Kids, settle down!"Miss Jenner was attempting to calm down the group of kids in her classroom."Everyone, quiet!!!"They didn't even notice her."Look, my Dad just sent me a picture of his mug," George, the tallest third-grader in the class, gloated.A picture of a mug, saying "#28 Dad," flashed on the iPhone in his hands."Yeah, well," Andy Sanders interrupted "Pops just called, and his mug says #26!"It was the day of the Great Mug Revelation.Or as the kids inside the room shouted: *My Dad is Greater than Your Dad Day*."Kids, I'm begging you," the teacher pleaded, her hair in a mess.She may just as well give up.Nothing was stopping these kids from bragging about their wonderful fathers.An eight-year old with blonde pigtails sat quietly in the corner of the room, pretending to read her book.Lisa knew fully well she couldn't join the endless chatter of her classmates.No matter how happy her Dad made her feel, his mug's number will never change.First off, all mugs in their home were plain, with no writings on them.Second, she was *adopted*.The Great Mug Revelation's rules were clear.Technicalities, more like.*The mug should have a written #1 Dad on it.The Dad must be a biological father*.The bell rang, interrupting her thoughts, followed by hundreds of kids running towards the gates, their enthused fathers waiting for them.It was all "*Dad you're still the best for me!!!*", or "*Wow, Pops, you ranked so high!*" with an occasional "*You could do better, Dad.*" 

Her Dad wasn't there.With a heavy heart, she ran home.-------

"How's school?"Terrence Andrews greeted his daughter when she got home.He had just finished preparing dinner for the family.Lisa walked past him, not saying a word.*This must be about the Great Mug Revelation*, he thought despondently to himself.The rules of the Revelation were announced a month ago on TV to give fathers all around the world to prepare.There was a little excitement at first, but when the technicalities were stated, Terrence looked at his daughter, tears forming in her eyes.Lisa knew she was adopted since she was six.The young girl promptly threw all printed mugs the next day.-------

Using a Sharpie, Lisa scribbled on the blank white mugs she got from the cupboard.She wanted to write * #1 DAD IN THE WHOLE WHOLE WIDE WORLD*, but she knew it wouldn't be right.Somewhere, around the world, a father would be holding a mug whose writing didn't change, basking in pride.*The true #1 Dad*.Then, as if a bulb appeared above her head, her face glowed with a smile.She was about to write a number she was sure that no mug in the world stated.Her father found her sitting on the kitchen table, a marker and a mug in hand."Lisa, dear, what are you doing?"Terrence asked the little girl.When Lisa was done, she gave her Dad the scribbled mug.For a moment, his face was scrunched up, trying to give meaning to the number written on the mug.Then realization dawns.Terrence gave her daughter a tight, warm hug, and said "Clever girl."He chuckled, his little girl in his arms "I love, love, love you so much."-------

"She waited two hours for your goodnight kiss, you know," Terrence was on the table, sipping a late-night cocoa."I know, I know," the man wearing a suit reached high for the coffee mix, his agile hands stretched out."I didn't expect the traffic, I'm sorry.""Look," Terrence pointed to his mug."That wonderful daughter of ours," he said with a grin.Lucas Andrews looked at his mug, with "* #0.5 Dad*" marked in his daughter's neat handwriting.He gave Terrence a lighthearted smile."It's a tie, isn't it?"
