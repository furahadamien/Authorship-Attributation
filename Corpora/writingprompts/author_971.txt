ShowMeWhatYouDid
I might make a post out of it if this goes under the radar but here's my contribution:

I rubbed my eyes and heard a sound like waves violently crashing on a rocky shore.I opened my eyes and my pyjama pants were burning.I started patting my groin frantically while thinking "STOP DROP AND ROLL" though I did nothing of the sort.I looked up from the smoldering embers that were my pants.In front of me stood a pony, white as snow and with a mane of flames flickering intensely in the light of this cold winter morning.My mind finally clicked and I ran inside and got the fire extinguisher."Daddy, why are you running daddy?""Nothing honey, go back to bed!"I said loudly with a higher pitch than normal.*thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud* 
Like any excited kid Clara didn't listen and ran down the stairs to greet whatever it was I was about to hose down with foam.Daddy, it's a pony!I know, don't go near it honey.I hosed it down and the flames on the ponies back rose taller and fiercer with a roaring whoosh the second the foam hit the flames.Unfazed the pony shot out flames from its nostrils.Clara giggled.-"More fireworks daddy!"I dropped the extinguisher and started patting the flames as I had done with my pants.Instead of dying down the flames dispersed in a ring and reappeared wherever I patted the pony.My panic died down to confusion as I realized the pony was fine.I flinched as Clara hugged my leg and said 
		Daddy, Santa read my letter!I think he did honey...
As I put my hand on her head I heard a dark and raspy "Ho Ho Ho"

Life had taken a turn for the weird.
