*I'm wading through a sea of waist deep blue-green grass.It ripples in waves as though stirred by a cool summer breeze, though the air is still.I look up into the night sky and... something is off.But I can't quite place it.It seems too empty.Like something is missing...*

*A distant ringing chime like the tolling of a far away church bell breaks my attention away from the strange, starry sky.My eyes scan the horizon but there is nothing but the endless, undulating meadow.Again the bell rings, louder and seemingly closer but still it is invisible to me.*

*With barely a moment's pause it rings a third time, this time crashing from all around me, deafeningly loud and accompanied by a droning buzz as though a cloud of insects were fast approaching.I reach up to shield my ears from the cacophony of noise and...*

"Could you get that?"My girlfriend's voice heavy with sleep penetrates through my stupor.The strangeness of the dream is already fading from my mind."Must be my brother...Different time zones."I'm a light sleeper so usually I'd have woken up before Jenny but I had a few too many drinks last night and my head is killing me.I pull off the covers and fumble for her phone on the nightstand quickly muting the ringer and glancing at the screen.For a moment the brightness blinds me and I blink and squint until I see not a call but texts and not from her brother but from a number I don't recognize.Sighing I turn off the screen and look over to see that she has already fallen fast asleep again.I lie back down and close my eyes but quickly realize my rude awakening had killed any hope for a quick return to sleep.Rolling over I grab my own phone and stand up to head to the bathroom.The hallway is bathed in a pale, eerie light.*Huh weird, must be a full moon tonight.* I think as I close the bathroom door behind me

I look down at my phone to see the time, 4:07 AM, and notice something very odd.My notifications, specifically the number of them.There are dozens, possibly even hundreds.Texts, facebook messages, snapchats, even reddit mail.For anyone this would be a peculiar occurrence but for someone like me who rarely gets more than a few texts a day it's more than just an anomaly.Something is wrong.As my pulse begins to increase I open my texts and scroll through.Too many to count, from practically every contact and even more from numbers I've never seen before in my life.All variations on the same message.>"Have you been outside tonight?Look at the Moon!">"It's a beautiful night, you really have to see this Moon!">"The Moon is so big and bright tonight, look out your window!"A chill runs down my spine.The content of the messages seems harmless enough but the repetition combined with the sheer volume fills me with a sense of unease, perhaps even dread.A loud crash of breaking glass from somewhere in our apartment causes me to whip my head away from my phone in shock.Instantly I'm at the door, phone discarded, messages forgotten.I rush into the bedroom ready to face whatever intruder might have invaded our home but instead find the room empty and the wall length window shattered.Glittering shards, and drops of red litter the floor.From where I'm standing in the doorway I can see through to the lawn and there standing facing away from me, arms hanging limply at her sides and head thrown stands Jenny.She is bathed in soft light, gazing towards the sky but at what I can't see from my vantage point.Then I notice the deep cuts in her arms and the blood running in rivulets, dripping off her fingertips and soaking the grass around her bare feet.I cry out in shock and fear, starting forward when suddenly the TV screen blares to life with a siren and a single scrolling line of white text accompanied by a robotic recitation.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

**WARNING.THIS IS A NATIONAL SECURITY BROADCAST.**

**DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON.DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LEAVE YOUR HOME.THIS IS NOT A DRILL.DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON.**

As the monotonous voice begins to repeat it's message my attention again shifts to Jenny.She still stands where she was before.But she isn't staring into the sky anymore.My shout, or maybe the TV has caught her attention and her head is twisted around at an unnatural angle.Her eyes are locked onto mine and they are no longer the dark brown, nearly black I have come to known and love but silvery white like pools of pure moonlight.Slowly, very slowly her deadpan expressions shifts as the corners of her mouth lift into a sweet and terrifying smile.Horrified I stumble backwards, falling into the hallway and scrambling back until my back hits the wall.The siren is still blaring, the words repeating.From outside I hear Jenny start to laugh.But it isn't her laugh.It's a tinkling almost musical sound but with a crazed, maniacal almost violent edge to it.Then "her" voice comes floating through the air and it's seductive and absolutely terrifying all at once."You simply must come out and look at the Moon my love.It is so very beautiful tonight..."
