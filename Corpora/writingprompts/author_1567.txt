Would you care if you found out the laws of physics are such that you are nothing more than a simulation, living in an executed reality on a cosmic level.Physicists still debate if there is an outside the shell world as it has been dubbed, where true reality exist that is where we were created but ever since the first zero latency quantum computer came online in 2242 and the experiments that arose from its creation there has been little doubt among experts that reality and virtual reality are identical.My area of study has been surrounding restructuring the programming, changing the laws of physics.We have theorized that the laws of physics change, in the 21st century it was almost common knowledge that at the edge of the universe and the farthest reaches of the expansion the laws of physics are entirely different and then rolling back to the creation at the Big Bang yet another set of rules.It wasnt until the first tier 3 black hole was created by scientists in 2350 that actual variation in the laws of physics was observed.Contorting physical laws intentionally and with purpose turns out to be much harder than initially suspected and humanity only had minor success; manipulating the set point of absolute zero to allow for nuclear fission at a marginally lower energy input being the biggest of this century.However that all changed, nesting a white hole inside a black hole creates a space where the two meet of such entropy in the laws of physics, its theorized time ceases to exist in any conceivable form.I wont clutter my memoir with excessive theory but this is where my experimentations had led me to.I had secured the necessary funding to build a shuttle to explore the region from a save distance, insulated from the gravitational distortion that would throw me off of the timeline I live in.The space station outside the solar system where black hole creation is done had been booked and as I suited up for what might be disaster I kissed my wife and began to embark.The black hole generated without a critical failure and the anti grav field was holding at 10% saturation, upon creation of the white hole at cruising distance the field load jumped to 52% saturation but stabilized at 34%, anything over 50% had been calculated to be too much to proceed safely.Nothing eventful happened as I approached the barrier between the two event horizons and my tunneled communication provided the base with live data of my approach.As I crossed the barrier and entered the dual horizon the saturation jumped to 90% and the cockpit became abuzz with lights and alarms, orbit had started to decay as the warp thrust was no longer able to outpace the gravitational pull, I was panicked, our most conservative calculations had said that at this distance I should still have complete thrust control (in retrospect we were testing for the breakdown of physics and should have considered that ... well physics equations would start to break down into meaningless numbers).A voice announced Anti Grav field saturation at 91%.I checked communications and nothing, I was completely in the dark and worse, the outside was completely in the dark.Anti Grav field at 95%.Quick diagnostics showed I was falling into the horizon with alarming speed.Anti Grav field at critical limit, failure imminent, now departing from linear time.My head was spinning, I was going to die, if the field was failing everyone I knew probably already died even if I somehow made it out.As the field broke down everything turned to white.I gasped and looked at my hands ... my hands were still there, I had a body.Nobody knows what happens as you fall into a black hole, maybe this place is it.Where was I. I turned to look around and shouted, behind me was the Federation Leader.What kind of conspiracy had I stumbled into that the Leader was here?Your mind has chosen this familiar form of authority to represent me, I am not actually the person that you know to hold this form the Leader said.What? was all I could stammer out, my mind took some time to actually register what he had said, what did he mean.And had he chosen to say that because he knew what I was thinking.I understand this is difficult to process, we created your world, your universe.

Alright definitely a mind reader.So our world really is virtual, is the outside world real? So many questions, but if our world was virtual how do I know this is real, how do I know I didnt bump my head when the shuttle was free falling and pass out.Im real, I can assure you, and you are as real as the sense of the word matters.Your world is modeled on an early version of our world, we need help and we hope you Testers can find a way to save us.You will join others that come in iteration of your world before this one.

Why have you gathered us, what makes us special that we can save those in The World Outside The Shell? And why would I want to save them.Testers are those who develop a sense of the fluid nature of physical laws, the first tester boiled water in a sealed container and made ice which broke the very simplistic seed world.You are familiar with what brought you yourself here.Every one of the Testers is able to manipulate physics through an ability that can only exist in this place.We cant make you save us but saving us is the only way to cross over to our world.

What sort of testing will we be doing?

We have ascended to a plane of non corporeal beings and ... we have forgotten how to die.We dont age, we dont forget, we just exist.

They ... they want me to help kill them?How, and why?Why would we do that.At that moment many people appeared.These are the other Testers, they will explain why you will become death in our world and you will decide if you want to join them, once you know the pain we endure.
