Deathisrebirth
Sweat decorated my face, my hands twitched, my personal signs of panic.I gripped my phone on one hand and on the other my bed sheets.A deafening silence filled my bed room."What the fuck?"I murmured to myself.I rose up to a sitting position, used the now dirty bed sheet to clean my face."Sarah?"I called out to my wife.Only silence answered my question.I ripped the sheets from my form and lunged out of bed."Sarah!"I screamed.I ran out the bedroom, down the hall, and entered the living room."Sarah?!"I yelled out once more.My eyes glanced about the room, scoutted the kitchen, peer to the old leathery couch but found nothing.I fox walked in darkness using the surface floor to fix my location."Sarah" I called out gently.I clenched my eyes shut and attempted to steady my breath.In and out.In and out.In and out.The back yard.She has to be there, no?I gathered whatever wits I had, which wasn't much to begin with and slowly walked to the other side of the room.Pale white blinds decorated the door in front of me.I swallowed empty dread that filled my mouth.I gently pull open the door.Sarah stood outside, standing on the soft green grass.Her back faced me.She stood still and was currently looking at the sky.I walked forward."Sarah, you're scaring me" i softly whispered.No answered came from her."Sarah, what the fuck are you looking-"

Words left my mouth.My hands shook and my breathing quickened.The moon floated above.Far bigger then it should have.Markings scarred it's surface like crude cross hatched shading.The lines grew and within the crevasses poured out blood.I was paralyzed.I couldn't look away.Not when the blood finished covering it.Not when the latitudes and longitudes pulled away from the center and revealed what was hidden inside.A humanoid beast.Its skin paled skin matched that of the moon.It's arms pulled away from its legs and oriented itself upwards.Its face simply consisted of 7 eyes.The remains of the moon orbit around the beast.Faster and faster they moved, until they were blur.The beast opened its eyes and the pieces began to glow.Spears, they began to distort and change and took the forms of glowing spears.Millions of miles away from Earth.Threw the empty void of space.The shafts of light flew.Each Longinus struck true and with  the impact millions of people were turned to their basic components.Primordial soup poured into valleys, flowed into rivers, flooded homes.Their souls however stayed where they once stood, whirled and moved and solidified into perfect red spheres.The spheres shot up towards the sky and stopped once the swarm overlooked the Earth.That day humanity vanished and the beast that screamed from the center of its egg feasted.***

I'm very sorry for any errors.English is not my first language and past brain trauma certainly doesn't help.Also I typed this out on my phone.So yeah.I would greatly appreciate any criticism.
