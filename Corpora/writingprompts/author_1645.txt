Torgar smacked his lips and grimaced."S'will.'Ats a mite fine grog fer a baby but no adult wou' touch it!""That's because it is water.""Wat' er?Wha- wha-...like in mah rain barrel!?""The very same."He looked down into his five pound metal stein, years of corrosion and mold added flavor to what was, a few moments ago, rain water."Wha' am I, a parsnip?"With a series of faces any mother of a picky eater knows well the dwarf finished the drink and let out a weak, breathy burp."Caw, 'tisn't even good the second time around!"The elf curled her lip and turned away, mouthing a litany of explatives under her breath as she did so."Those ruins we 'splored yesterday."This caused all eyes to turn to the dwarf.Beyond a recollection of what was eaten or drunk, the vulgar little man had spoke not at all of anything in the abstract.When alone, the elf and gnome speculated that dwarven society might be completely without susinct chonological verbage, though the human was quick to point out the only representatives of Dwarf Kind were exiles, hermits and traders unless one actually met them in their remote mountain homes and dwarves were even less included to take vistitors than the elves."What about them?"asked Sethith as casually as the old wizard was able; it had been his insistence that they explore the defiled fain of a long forgotten god.And while they had cleared the place out they'd found nothing beyond the usual old coins and random sellables."Th' tomb room."All of them gapped.Here was their besotted ax man passing an actual recollection.Sethith's eyes twinkled as he pulled his notes from yesterday."Yes, what of it?"" 'T'was false.'S dummy room, th' real deal's right under that icky a pool a few doors down.""It wasn't icky, man, it was a gray ooze laying in wait!"The dwarf shrugged as if rancid water and a man-sized carnivorous amoeba were interchangable."We're going back, then?!"Asked the ever eager gnome."Aye."

"Wah?""The unlicensed vendor you purchased your wallet from."I looked down at my wallet, far more concerned about needing to replace the ID and stuff, as it was otherwise all cards.So why was it bleeding?"W-wa- Vendor?"I tried, his gun still smoked a little and was leveled on my Italian Leather Trifold.Now leaking strawberry jam; though I knew there was no stray packet of condiment."A Mimic laid her eggs in his box of knock off consumer goods."I was only half listening: my wallet had begun to writhe around, trying to inchworm away.But the 9mm bullets had torn it up pretty bad, and it toppled over making me jump far more than it should have."Yeah, some poor bastard just lost a finger when his fake Nikes decided they didn't want to be put on."I stared and watched my wallet adopt a slithering hop, which unexpectedly made my assailant-turned-protector bolster his gun."Great!I only wounded it; let's follow."I watched dumbfounded as the tattered remains of my billfold found it's stride and began to hustle.Any on looker would have watched two unlikely friends following a piece of windblown trash."This is Great!I've never seen one locomote like this before!We always assumed a spore or seed but that things imitating a brown paper bag caught in the wind!"While shock and disbelief still held my tongue I grunted in agreement: it a matter seconds the fine tan leather had taken on the texture of crumpled paper and darkened to match."The fellows of The Cryptozoology Society will be thrilled!Must be a larval stage; goodness knows the full-sized ones are bait-pounce predators.That snapped me out of it."Full sized?""Goodness yes.In the Middle Ages they seemed to prefer chests and barrels; modern Mimics like to assume the form of abandoned, expensive luggage."
