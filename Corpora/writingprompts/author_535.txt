My father loads his rifle full of bullets.I asked him,"What are you doing dad?""Well, my mug says number two, and James's mug says number one.I must be number one."He raises his rifle and fires.Killing his life long friend.He grabbed his mug from the table and saw it turn from #2 to #4569.My father laughed and said, "I'm gonna need more bullets."
