It was just another day in England, and could be described succinctly with one word.Moist.The rain was at that stage of its life where it wasn't willing to commit hard enough for anything meaningful, but just felt like being around the area and occasionally clinging to you as you walk down the street to the local fish 'n chips.Now, that's not to say that the weather was as dreary and annoying everywhere in England, even though it unfortunately was.There was only one road in Highbury where the weather was different.Okay, maybe different isn't the best descriptor.It was like the Apocalypse.The Gates of Hades had opened at each end of the road.From these gates poured the souls of the damned and righteous alike, swirling through the houses of the London suburb with the kind of shrieks that put people in mental hospitals.&#x200B;

From each portal stepped two massive horses, and on each horse sat a body cloaked in steel and darkness; and despair.The first on the left raised his hand."War, good to see that you and Death could make it.We know how busy the humans keep you"."Pestilence, Famine, my ~~brothers~~  gender-neutral siblings" shouted War over the siren song of the dead, "I hear the old meatsacks have been keeping you on your toes as well, what with all this not vaccinating and not feeding the hungry."Pestilence nodded at him.They closed in on each other, ending at the door marked No.12, of Arbor Road.Death lifted his hand, rapping the firm and shiny knuckle-bones against the inconspicuous door.The door was quite lucky that it was dead, or else it would have ended up like the family of beetles living inside it.Dead.The door creaked open ominously, much like a lid of a coffin opening, and from that coffin walked the fifth horseman of the apocalypse.Bean.&#x200B;

"Ignorance!"Shouted Famine, pushing through the others to wrap Bean in its skinny arms.Bean pushed at Famine, moving the armour plated figure surprisingly far.A decidedly long session of grunting and charades followed, that is until the sound of War's hand making contact with his own face silenced the street.Even the ghoulish souls were scared of what was to come."Ignorance has taken his job so seriously," he whispered into his hands, "that he has forgotten us and himself in the process."A mortal would never claim to have the authority, nay, the gall, to suggest that these immortal Harbingers of the Apocalypse did not handle this particular piece of information very well.In fact they were able to keep a calm head about this until Bean walked back out of the house with a flask and five cups.&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The Five Horsemen set out to Stonehenge.Bean had been magnanimously strapped to War by the party, and was now travelling with them despite his nasal cacophony of anguish and confusion.Thunder that rattled the world followed their journey.Explosions in a multitude of colours mixed into the rain, which had really come into itself in the last half hour and was truly coming down like cats and dogs, with the occasional small mammal mixed in for good literal measure.Hoof prints of fire led to the ancient stone circle of doom, placed there by the Gods like a restart button on a PC.Not enough to switch the project off for good, just enough to wipe the memory and start fresh.They took up their positions in the pentagram, and looked bloody marvelous doing it.They were covered in fire and starlight, and one was wearing a lovely tweed.Each raised a sword, swinging it down in front of themselves to split the Earth in five.Well, four were trying to split the Earth.One was trying to split the other four.Pestilence was unfortunate enough to be closest.His body was bisected rather easily, the rotting armour and flesh falling to the floor in piles.Bean swung the other way, cleaving a rather unsightly dent into Famine.Bean grunted heroically at this.&#x200B;

War and Death looked at each other.No one knows what words were spoken between their eyes, or what tone the flick of an eyebrow could convey, but it probably went something like this:

&#x200B;

*Death: What in the name of God is going on here?*

*War: Ignorance has lost it.Well to be honest he probably didn't have it in the first place.*

*Death: We've lost two and Ignorance is trying to kill us, surely we can't still finish calling the Apocalypse.*

*War: Okay let's call it off, hire some interns, and come back as the Four Horsemen.We just won't fetch this idiot next time.*

&#x200B;

As their eyes met, they vanished, and Bean was left alone, in the moonlight, at Stonehenge, with a sword, in a tweed coat.And nothing else.
