I would have pissed my pants, if I had not just closed the stall door.She was screaming at me.Ranting.Spitting.The temperature in the room was rising.A truly terrifying sight.But what terrified me more, was when she suddenly went calm.The temperature fell and I could feel the cold air biting my lungs.I stepped away and hit the stall door.Fine. She said.Be it your way.

She smiled.I knew, I had made a mistake.\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Around fifty years in, I had forgotten about the incident in the stall.I was holding my great-great-grandchild in my arms.She was peaceful.And so was I.\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Around seventy years in, I had just celebrated my hundredth birthday, I felt this foul taste in my mouth.\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Eighty years in.Governments are collapsing.Power has been rotating between the same people for decades.People are angry.About the chemical infertilization the whole world has suffered.About nothing changing.About the world falling apart and nobody doing anything.They are angry at me.\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Eighty point five years in.If you dont follow them, they infect you with the Anti-Vaccine.You die.\*\*\*  
 

Eighty five years in.A terrorist attack.I am now the last person holding the last name of Olara.A viral attack on a small genetic misstep in my family.All of them Caucasian died.I must have survived cause of my fathers African genes.I wish I had not.My daughter fought so, so long.I am holding her too.I dont want to let go what is gone.\*\*\*

&#x200B;

A hundred years ago I thought I had bested her.The devil.I remember the incident in the stall.How foolish of me.Puny human.I break the mirror which a young man was staring back at me in.I take a big chunk.Time to pay my debt I guess.I smash it into my throat.&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I open my eyes.And angelic creature stands before me.Have.Have I been forgiven for my sins?Oh praise the lord!

The angelic creature raises his eyebrow.Are you serious?You have never even used a word of prayer in your life.Forgive?You?

He starts laughing.I am staring at him.Disbelief.He doesnt stop laughing.I catch my wits.Will I be sent to hell?To atone for my sins? I ask, trembling.He stops laughing slowly.To be very honest, he strokes hair out of his face.The only sin you are to be accused of is Self murder.

But what about the world?My immortality technology has destroyed the world! I scream, madness creeping up on me.I want to be punished.I want to make my wrongs right.I

Never happened.  
 I stop mid thought.What?  
   
 

Never happened. He could not care less.See, your technology would have caused havoc.We just could not let this happen.So much work we would have to do!So we just showed you this.You basically dreamed it.And we kept it spinning until you finally killed yourself.Now you can go to hell.Literally.You never left the bathroom.

My eyes widened.Are you, are you one of hers?!

What!By the holy trinity, what went into you!No of course, I am your guardian angel.You know how much trouble you would have made me if you had stayed alive!I really needed to make sure you go to hell and never come back.Suicide is a hellfire proof way for that!

I tremble.Flames are licking at my heels.Growing.I can hear her laughter.This is it.My end.My beginning.\*\*\*

100 years in.My name is Akatosh.The Archdemon of the Internet.I have come to shut you down.&#x200B;
