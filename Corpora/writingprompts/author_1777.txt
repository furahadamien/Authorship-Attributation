It was a cold, bright Feburary morning, snow gently falling across the frozen ground as I sat in my backyard, drinking hot chocolate and enjoying a day's respite from high school.I stared blankly at my phone, my mind lost in thought as the video on its screen past by unnoticed.More important things were going through my mind, at least more important to a teenage boy, thoughts of pretty girls, nice cars, next year's football season, and so on.I was so lost in my own mind that I failed to notice the ruckus eminating from inside the house.It startled me to hear my step-father suddenly start yelling.Another man chimed in, yelling back, and I heard sounds of a scuffle.I quickly put my phone down and ran inside the house, nearly running over my mother as she made her way in the same direction.Together, we rushed in to the foyer.The scene left both my mother and I stricken, mouths agape, jaws dropped.My father, missing for 10 years, lay on the ground holding his head, a bright bruise starting to appear under his right eye.My stepfather stood above him, shouting at him to get out of our house.He had never met my father, had came into the picture some years after my father's mysterious disappearance to comfort my mother and eventually start a new family with her, so he had no idea who this man was or why he had intruded into our home.In his hand, my stepfather had his cell phone out, most likely dialing the police, to come arrest this stranger.My mother, partially regaining her senses, reached out and touched his arm.Mom: "Dave... this man... this is..Kevin."Step-father: "Kevin... your first husband?"Dave, my step-father, looked down at the man, his phone forgotten.Dave: "You said he was dead..."

	Mom: "He was missing, presumed dead.He was declared dead after a few years when they found no trace of him."Mom directed her attention to Kevin.Mom: "Kevin... where have you been?It's been 10 years!You've been alive this whole time?!"Kevin looked up, startled.He had a hand to his eye, massaging what must have been where an unexpected right hook landed cleanly.Kevin: "What the hell are you talking about?!I left half an hour ago!I'm sorry it took so long, I got stuck in traffic!Jesus, is that all the time it took for you to roll some other man in here?!"He looked around the room, noticing for the first time that the furniture and decor around the foyer was different than he remembered.His eyes panned over to me, and I watched as panic, confusion, and sadness immediately flashed across his face.Kevin: "Son... oh my god, son.You're so much older now... you're a man now.What has happened to me..."
	
He broke down, tears falling from his eyes.I moved over to him, putting my arms around him, tears falling from my eyes as well.I had not seen this man for 10 years, had pushed him out of my mind and replaced him with Dave, had given up hope on ever seeing him again, yet in that moment, emotions took over, and I felt guilt at my actions.This man loved me, loves me, and it was wrong of me to have given up hope.My father embraced me, sobbing into my shirt, as my other parents looked on.Dave: "I don't believe it.The one damn time I need to make an emergency call and this fucking phone that I'm paying $200 a month for doesn't fucking work.What the fuck do you mean 'No Signal'?"Mom: "You're still calling the police?!"Dave: "This man has been missing for 10 years.He doesn't realize how much time has passed.He doesn't need to be arrested, but he definitely needs an ambulance!"Mom thought about this a moment, then agreed.She started patting her pockets, trying to find her phone.Exasperated, she looked back to me and my father.Mom: "Son, do you have your phone?I don't remember where I left mine."I looked back to her, tears still falling from my eyes, and began patting my own pockets.After a moment, I realized that I had left it out back on the patio with my mug.Me: "It's out back, I'll go grab it."I looked back at my father, squeezed him once more, and trotted out of the foyer towards the back door.I exited the house, walked to the patio, and grabbed my phone.The words 'No Signal' were at the top of the screen.I looked quizically at it...I had never seen it say that before, we're in the middle of the suburbs in a major city, there are cell towers everywhere.I half-sat at the patio chair, more of a lean than anything, and pulled up the phone dialer anyways to try to make a call.I stared blankly at the phone, my mind lost in thought as the screen flashed "No signal" again.Suddenly, thoughts of pretty girls, nice cars, and next year's football season enveloped my mind.My step-father's yell snapped my attention back to reality, as I heard a scuffle eminating from the foyer.I quickly put my phone down and ran inside the house, nearly running over my mother as she made her way in the same direction.Together, we rushed in to the foyer, and the same scene replayed itself again.And again.And again.And again.
