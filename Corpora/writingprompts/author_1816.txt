We are going on a ride today!I love rides!But my Master is sad ...I get up and whine and yelp and bark and wiggle.Usually this works, but this time He just picks me up and hugs me and His eyes are wet and His nose is hot and slobbery but I do not mind because He starts to scratch my neck and chest and I love that.The moving room is stopping.Master lets me out and picks me up and carries me into a ... place.I do not like this place.It smells funny.I smell other dogs and cats and prey and something else that scares me.Master is talking to someone.They reach out to touch me, but they smell ... not bad, but bad is around them.I do not want them to touch me.They stop trying to touch me and Master says "It's all right, you'll be ok." But why do I suddenly feel like Master does not really mean it?Master carries me into another room and this is where the other smells come from.There are other dogs and cats and prey and I forget to be scared because I am so curious.But we do not stop here.We go into another room with one of those big things where I went to sleep and woke up with a pain in my belly.I do not like this.Have I done something wrong Master?Please, I will fix it.I will be a good dog!Master talks to the other and He sounds mad but smells sad.The other points to the door and Master turns.Suddenly, I do not want Master to leave.I call for Master."Master!"Master stops.I wait for Master to turn around and pick me up and take me away from this place.This bad place.I am so scared I cannot stop whimpering.Master walks away."Maaaaaaaster!Nooooooo!"I feel a pain.I feel sleepy.Not a good sleepy.A bad sleepy.I do not understand.He was supposed to be my Master.I was supposed to train my replacement so Master could be Master.I am sorry I failed.Please forgive me Master.I sleep.---

I know this doesn't exactly match the prompt, I hope it's still allowed.When I was 16 we lost our house and we couldn't find a place that would rent to dog owners in the time we had.When I took Patches to the pound they said that they were full up and if I left her they would have to put her down.I didn't have any choice.And then the guy wouldn't let me be there when he put her down.This prompt brought all of that crashing home.I hope it provides some catharsis for you.It did me, a little.Edit: Removed contractions.
