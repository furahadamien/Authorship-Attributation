The shock of the sudden change was always the worst.Steven looked around, holding his side.It was early.He was early.A few days maybe?Not good.He looked down at his side, it was bleeding, badly, he would only survive another jump, maybe two if he was lucky.He thought of his old friend, who had refused to tell him about the first time they met... but he had figured it out.But if he never made it, then everything would fall apart.He had been there for his very first jump, he had been a little disoriented everytime he had shown up.Now he knew why.His friend would see him die, a stranger would walk into his home.Steven ripped the space time continuum apart and felt reality shimmer around him, a black void less maw engulfing him, crushing him.It was just as terrifying as it had been the first time.He landed and stumbled forward, raising his bloody hand to knock on the door.It swung open and a small boy stood there, Steven smiled through tears and spoke in the ancient language that Yvez had taught him."Old friend, I finally figured it out.Just so you don't get lost on the way, I made a list..." Steven struggled to pull his paper, a list of times he had encounter Yvez, out of his pocket.He handed it to him, and said "until the next time" as he ripped himself through space and time, knowing fair well he wouldn't survive this jump.
