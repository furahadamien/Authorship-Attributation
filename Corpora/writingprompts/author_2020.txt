They say that there's a light at the end but there isnt.There is nothing until you get there.Just silence and darkness.Almost like being asleep, but awake the whole time.It's scary, hell, it's terrifying!And i just couldnt get myself to make the whole journey there.But in the darkness i finally heard something, a whimpering girl.I followed the sounds, then everything lit up.We were both ecstatic to have finally found contact.That's when it hit me.We chatted and laughed and even cried some more.We became best friends for a while, but something seemed to be bugging her.When i asked what it was she said that she felt like she was being pulled away.I was puzzled, but her even more so when i didnt have the same feeling.We knew what had to be done.So that's how i got this job.It's honest work and sometimes it does get to be thankless or even lonely.But then i remember that girl and where she went and how we both felt so lost and lonely in that darkness.Now, if you'll take the next few steps here without me, you'll get to meet her.Hopefully i'll see you all again soon, but there is someone else who needs me now...
