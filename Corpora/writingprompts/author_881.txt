I was seven the first time it happened.The teacher was in the middle of having us recite our multiplication tables.I was daydreaming, staring absentmindedly into space while the sun shining through the windows lulled me into a pleasant state of drowsiness.It took a few seconds for me to realize the monotone drone of numbers had stopped, leaving nothing but silence.I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and looked around.All my friends were frozen - Tom over there with his glasses falling off the bridge of his nose, Abigail's eyes mid-blink.Before I could react, everything snapped back into motion.They continued reciting as if they hadn't just been paralyzed, trapped in time.I was practically bouncing out of my chair, holding back a grin.I had powers!That dream died quickly.Try as I might, I could never get time to stop or start at will; it seemed to do as it pleased.I tried rewinding it that one time I asked my crush out while hammered, fast-forwarding it at a high school recital; once I even tried to jump back a few years to the last time I saw my gran before the dementia set in.No go.Time, however was cooperative enough in stopping so I could watch the life leave her in the hospital bed at my own pace.Her veiny hands stayed curled around my own until the world started up again and her heart monitor flatlined.The last time, I was on the subway home from work.The train car rolled to a halt in the station, hydraulics hissing, but the doors did not open.A quick glance at my watch - the second hand had stopped ticking.Dammit.Hopefully, it wouldn't be too long.I pulled out my phone to occupy myself for however long I would be stuck.A flash of movement caught my eye and my head snapped up.Noone else ever moved when the world stopped, ever.My eyes darted from person to person, each perfectly still.Was I imagining things?Had I gone mad?Was this all some twisted hallucination that was finally moving to the next level?Movement again, outside the car.I ran to the window, stumbling over my own feet, just to catch a glimpse of strawberry-blonde hair tucked into a knit cap disappearing into the crowd, nimbly darting around the mass of motionless commuters.I banged on the glass."Hey!"I shouted."Hey-y!"The stranger didn't respond or react in the slightest, just continuing to run off.I couldn't even tell if they heard me.The subway doors opened with a lurch and a few people glanced at me, gaze flicking up from their respective devices for a few seconds before steadfastly ignoring the crazy guy banging his fist against the window.Heat crept into my cheeks and I sat back down.I spent that night staring at the ceiling in the dark, agonizing.Who was that?Did someone else have this power, this influence over time?Could they teach me?Were they trying to meet me?The next day, shadows deep under my eyes, I took the train back to the same station.It would have been faster to take a different route, but I had to know - I /had/ to.I stood on that platform for hours, looking for the same blonde hair, the same small figure.I was met with a sea of people, but none of them the one I was looking for.It was nearing the end-of-day rush.Deflated, I readied myself to push onto the next homeward-bound train.It stopped abruptly at the platform, the screeching of the rail being cut off into absolute silence."Hi."I whirled around.Directly behind me stood a young man, about my age, with short-clipped strawberry blonde hair.His hospital scrubs peeked out from under his long black coat, hands shoved deep in the pockets.He shuffled his feet, reached up to push his glasses back up the bridge of his nose.I blinked."Tom?"He smiled, but his eyes were shaky."You remember me!""Dude, it's been years!I haven't seen you since - what, high school?""Well... Yeah, you haven't seen me.""Wait, so, this -" I gestured to the static people around me "- is you?This is all you?"He nodded."So then, in elementary school - "

"I kind of froze," he laughed, glancing off to the side."That was by accident and I didn't know what was going on.Everything just stopped, except...Except you.I thought I was crazy, so I never brought it up."I thought back to every instance time had stopped.Up until a certain point, they had been serendipitous - in the middle of an exam I would have bombed otherwise, just before the bus home from school took off.It was only after graduation that the pauses grew erratic, almost inconsiderate.Except -

"The hospital," I said."That was you?"Tom nodded."I dunno.It had been so long, and I felt kind of weird talking to you when you were there for - well - yeah.I thought it would be nice to give you some more time.I realized after that that was pretty stupid.I'm sorry."I clenched and unclench my fists a few times."It's... Fine.It's fine.But why are you coming to me now, if it was awkward then?"He looked down at his feet, face coloring pink."Holy shit," I said, the realization dawning on me."That's kind of sweet, actually.""This is probably really weird -" 

" - no kidding - "

"But, I mean, hey."He glanced up to meet my eyes and gave me a shy smile."You're the only other person who can move when the world stops, so... We could use that."I laughed."Buy me dinner first.Next Friday at eight?""I'll be there," he promised."After all, I've got plenty of time."(bad pun didn't know how to end this sorry)
