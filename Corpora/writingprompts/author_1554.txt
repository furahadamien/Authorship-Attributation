To be a form of death is an art, really.We must take it as one to fully respect and appreciate our position on the spectrum of order and chaos.We have several projects on the go, and though it is not as many as some, it simply means we allow more care and dedication to our specific flavour.I like to make dying a process, because I find it makes the life substance so much richer.It becomes stewed and overpowering, leaving you with a bittersweet buzz somewhere between nostalgia and homesickness.My pet project is a middle aged man with leukemia.Influenced into existence by a lineage of hand picked predecessors, genetically primed over generations of selective breeding to create a nearly perfect balance of health, sickness and hope.We are predicting that his body will almost survive, for his mother was hand picked for her physical willpower and optimistic outlook, which inevitably she passed onto her son.Through the right environmental influence and our delicate hands of manipulation, she found his selected father with minor interruptions.Occasionally we get poachers who try and couple their cheaper humans with ours in the hopes that they will gain the rights to accidental offspring or early harvest life substance, but their techniques of human connective manipulation are usually lackluster and short-lived.Our humans always feel more compelled to follow our richer and more fulfilling influence paths.My leukemia patient was also born into a long standing theistic belief program that our cultural team developed in humans some several hundred years before his birth.Our commitment to human creativity means that the moment of death will be imaginative and expectant of something more, leaving you wanting more; satisfied but desiring.In the end our product is always the superior on the market.Forty years of carefully planned living, carefully planned environmental conditions, and careful collaboration with outside breeders, all summarised in just one moment of harvest.A moment truly unique,suspended in time, complete and enriching.
