Drelthian
The first time it happened, I never understood why.I was just going about my day, checking my phone for messages.I bumped into someone by accident, and immediately apologized."I'm so sorry!I didn't mean anything..." I overly apologized until I realized something was wrong.Time was frozen.Every time since then has been different, understandably.The second time, fluids still moved yet solids remained still.The third time light froze as well.Eventually I learned to accept it, and lost track of the number of times it happened.One day, I was walking outside with no reason and it happened again.A leaf drifting down froze, and rather unknowingly I ran into it.I sighed, and looked around, making sure no one saw my movements jump from one place to another.Luckily, everyone was looking down at their phones, frozen.Then, I saw some movement.A flash, perhaps, or maybe just some animal that slipped from the time freezing.I jogged over, just to be sure.What I saw surprised me more than anything else.What happened there could only be described as the magical battles you could only see in books.Lights flashed, odd bolts whizzed and two people could be seen.One was dressed in light colors, the other dark.After it was all finished, only one person remained.The other was gone.The one remaining wore dark clothes, and made brief eye contact.They walked over, concerned."Are you alright?"they asked.I nodded, curious but afraid of what had just happened.I swallowed a bit, not sure what to say."Uh... shouldn't I be asking you that?"I replied, sounding awkward.They laughed a bit, and looked back at me."It was all frozen but you right?"they ask, their fright returning to their voice."Yeah" I replied.I told them about the other times it had happened.Time had already gone back to normal by now, but I didn't realize it yet.We parted ways, and I felt rather anti-climatic about all these events.So, I suppose time will have to keep on going and one day the mysteries might be solved.
