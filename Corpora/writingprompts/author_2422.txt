I need help.At first, I enjoyed it, but now it disgusts me.I chose him because he seemed expendable, worthless, someone that wouldnt be missed.But he took to it too well, the killing.I suppose I should start at the beginning.Im a demon.I possess people willing to make a deal with me.My problem is once I possess someone, I cant leave until they die.But my power burns out a humans body in a matter of weeks, maybe months if theyre strong.In exchange, I give them the ability to get away with whatever they want.They become essentially invisible, as if they didnt exist, forgotten as soon as you turn away.I become a voice in their ear, feeding off the death of their soul as I convince them to do more and more evil.At least, thats what I used to do.My current host agreed immediately.I should have been concerned about his eagerness, but it had been months since I last fed, so I was a little desperate.It normally took me a little while to talk them into performing even one murder.But, this time, we stareted immediately.We killed 7 people in a week and I was delighted.My power kept us from being caught, but his meticulous nature made it almost unnecessary.It was almost as if he were prepared to kill at a moments notice.I was elated, I was more full than I had been in centuries.But then...it escalated.It went from one per day to two, then three.And he wasnt burning out, he was getting stronger.When times get bad for a demon, we can usually exert full control over our host.It takes a lot of our energy to do it, but I had been well fed over the last few months, so I was confident that I could do it.I will never forget what he told me.You are mine.You have no power over me.And you will do what I command.Now shut up, and keep us hidden. I was forced down, unable to speak, unable to exert any sort of influence, save my obscurity.We kill without purpose, without mercy, and yet I just want to die.Ive lost count of the number of lives, the number of heroes that try to find the killer.Each one has met with death by our hands.Other demons have even tried to find me, but I cant drop my obscurity field, even for them.We walk past each other, and I am powerless to reach out.Even this diary is pointless.I have written thousands like it, and you remember none of them.That is the only reason he lets me write them.Each time he tells me Write another one.Maybe this time it will be different. I have just enough control of his body to write, but it never matters.They are always forgotten as soon as you finish reading it.I have done this thousands of times over the centuries we have been together.Newspapers, magazines, blogs, videos, every conceivable media, and no one remembers.He grows stronger with every life he takes, and I dont need to feed anymore, his life force sustains me.Unless you can remember, the sun will burn out before his body wil...
