The group was gathered in the living room of their twisted mansion.Sloth sprawled across the comfiest  and largest sofa, much to the others annoyance as they had to pile together on the remaining furniture.Lust smiled across at Pride from his perch on the armrest of Wrath's armchair."Well, Pride, you must be wondering why we called this meeting."He said with a sly smile, leaning precariously against the headrest.Pride looked around, "I thought this was about Greed?""Yes well we may have told a tiny little white li-"

"No it was a blatant lie it's about you" Envy snapped, interrupting the scantily clad sin.Pride was usually quite on board with people talking about her, she was definitely the most important in this room of sins so why shouldn't they talk about her.But the way her siblings glares shot daggers at  her made her feel uneasy."Are you..." she paused, taking another sweeping look at the room, "jealous of me or something?""OF COURSE WE'RE JEALOUS OF YOU!"Wrath howled at her, making Lust lose balance temporarily on his perch out of shock, "YOU HAVE A WHOLE MONTH DEDICATED TO YOU AND WE DON'T"

"For once I agree with that bitch," Greed spoke, pointing a finger at the enraged Wrath, "I /want/ a month"

Pride pushed a hand through her silky brown locks, she was confused.Pride Month?How had she not heard of it.Almost like a brick, it hit her."GUYS PRIDE MONTH ISN'T ABOUT ME!"She snorted, laughing hysterically between words."Then /who/ is it about," Envy pouted."IT'S ABOUT THEM LGBTQ WHATS-IT FOLKS!""LGBTQ?"Wrath said, clueless."You know, them folks who are like," Pride finally stopped laughing and wiped her tears with a finger,  "gay, bisexual, trans.Those guys.""I SHOULD'VE KNOWN!"cried Lust, falling from his spot, "I SHOULD'VE KNOWN!"The whole room groaned, knowing they wouldn't hear the end of this."So we called this whole meeting for nothing?"Sloth yawned into the couch cushion."This just goes to show, how great I am compared to you guys who didn't even know about a big historical mortal tradition," Pride gloated."Especially you Lust, since your so keen on sexuality and sex."Lust groaned again, "I call this meeting adjourned, before we lose our minds with Pride's ramblings"

The group split and left the room, leaving Pride to gloat to a sleeping Sloth.
