So there I was in an alley.It was pretty dark when suddenly I saw a man.He pulled a gun out and said "Can I have your wallet?"I gave it to him- begrudgingly.Suddenly he threw it on the ground and repeatedly fired his gun at it until the wallet screeched.The man turned to me and said "you're safe now."The end.
