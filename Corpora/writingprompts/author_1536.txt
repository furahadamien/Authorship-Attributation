I have lost track of time.I don't know how long I have been their captive since there is no light source in my cell, but I know I am not the only one.The scratches had seemed deeply unsettling at first.It was hard to tell if it had been done with a tool or with human nails.But after time began to blurr together.Sleep, wake to the smell of sugar, get bored, and sleep again.Rinse and repeat.I can barely fit in my clothes anymore!The scribbles on the walls are now my friends.Well, them and my warden, she seems alright.(Up vote if you would like to read more.)
