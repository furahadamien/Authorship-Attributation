"Oh, God DAMN IT!not again!"Lucy exclaimed, obviously flustered about me appearing out of thin-air in her vicinity.It took me a moment to register the situation, and then immediately realise how messed up the situation truly was.It was her grandmother's wake in Toronto; a few thousand miles away from me in Florida.While she was evidently saddened by the event, I had no knowledge of this, and was instead doing some homecleaning, dancing in my underwear to my Queen playlist; Tie your mother down, to be exact; poor choice of song for the situation.The amount of eye contact with everyone; strangers, her parents and brother included, amounted to what almost equated as a firing squad.Considering her immediate family was made aware of my...."situation" with Lucy, it never did make it any less awkward.Regardless, there I am, near-buck naked in a funeral procession; neurons firing double time to think of an explanation, reasoning, humourous joke, anything to break the ice.Then again, it wasn't my fault.Turning to Lucy, coolly as the day I tarnished my birthday suit, I proclaimed "Really?ANOTHER booty call now?"slyly smirking.A few chuckles and "spit your drink" chortles were heard, so I perceived this as a success.She just gave me the death glare, excused us from the room, and dragged me out of sight into the next room.She composed herself thusly."Adam, don't get me wrong, that was fucking brilliant, but you're a fucking idiot.what are you DOING here?"She began in a frustrated tone."Hell if I know, Lu.We both know how it works, remember?""But I don't NEED you right now!Last week yo---
"PLEASE don't remind me of that.I'm still trying to get the stains out.Which reminds me....." 

As I said this, I not-so subtly leaned in to her face and sniffed.My assumption was correct, exclaiming a rather large sigh."You were drinking, weren't you?", Her gaze shifting to the floor left of me, like a child stealing a cookie."...No......" She stuttered."I don't blame you, but I should be the last thing in your mind, especially now.", stating the obvious misconnection, but she just shrugged it away.there was nothing she could do.The air became tangible at this point, as the conversation became silent and awkward; She didn't know what to do, and given his mishap of this "gift", she knew I was stuck here, two thousand miles from home as it wasn't the first time.This was the least of my concern, however."So I don't suppose there's a spare suit?not everyone showed up in white....".I had to break the silence somehow.There was a dead person in the other room, hundreds of other strangers questioning the situation.Forget being laughed at, I'm pretty sure her uncle Pete from Texas is here, and he's a big fan of formal occasions, just as an excuse to bring his shotgun.She scoffed at my petty attempt."Wait Here."she said, and went back into the room, leaving me here like a lost shaven puppy for quite some time.It felt like an eternity before she came back.I was expecting some sort of literal monkey suit.Instead, she came back with a pair of stained slacks, an inverted KILLERS T-shirt and a red tie.A feeble attempt at best, but she's trying."You know....you don't have to go now..." she subtly informed me, drifiting the question off as though it was a cheesy line from a porno."Yeah, because everyone isn't going to question why a chubby guy in underwear popped into existence at nana's funeral.it's bad enough as it is......wait, no cufflinks?".I didn't wanna be here any longer than I already had.Finishing the tie up, I felt like I looked like something out of a horror movie.Nothing wrong with searching for the right alleyway, then.
