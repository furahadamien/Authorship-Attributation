It's was a Christmas day that part was true.But the snow had not fallen.Not enough to even cover a shoe.The the man lay and wait for his family to arise as he lounged on the couch and rubbed sleep from his eyes.See he was home from college.To his mother's great joy.But his brothers could care less, they wernt merely just boys.The brothers were at this point in time, young men of their own.Angst and bodyhair, and sweet and grime.They cared not at all that their brother was home.Choosing instead to go off on their lives all alone.Now this fact it did seem made the elder quite sad.For all he wanted and wished was to spend time with the lads.He felt like the boys, the brothers, the men.Cared not for him nor his actions for them.But on Christmas day the two boys arose, at a time quite new.See they normally stayed in their beds till bout 2.Not this morning no.The pair had awoken.Went downstairs and had greeted their brother with words long not spoken."I'm happy your home."One said very stoic."Its kinda lame here without you, alone."The other agreed with a nod and a grunt.He was a man with few words and that fact was blunt.The eldest brother smiled and looked at these two.The pair before him both old.And yet new.See a detail was lost.Was torn from the pages.The difference between the boys was naught just of ages.The two brothers were brothers by blood and by birth.The eldest was added by marriage henceforth.He felt like the two had naught a care for him.But this display of affection small when viewed from outside.Ment the world to the eldest who took it in stride.The three sat and wait.For the parents arrival .The three of them watching a show on survival.The three were just brothers.No distinction, no guff.They were brothers that's all... and that was more than enough.
