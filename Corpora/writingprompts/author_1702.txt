Brent looked at his home woefully, unable to understand how his luck had taken such an awful turn in such a short time.Things had looked so promising just last week.First the Waltons next door sold their lovely Victorian for more than a million above market value.It'd been such a beautiful property, Brent was surprised when the new owners began demolishing immediately.The very next day the Doctor Thomson and VanDeans had sold their homes as well.Brent didnt know for how much but he had heard it was lucrative.Brent had foolishly thought he knew what was happening then.Some wealthy buyer wanted the neighborhood to themselves and had made the mistake of quickly purchasing a donut of property surrounding Brents own home.Hed smugly decided to hold out for millions more than the first offer made, grinning devilishly at his own clerverness.But the offer had not come.Instead Brent had watched in horror as the Walton home somehow was replaced by a turkey processing plant.The smell was nearly as wretched as the constant gobbling...how did those zoning permits ever get signed?The VanDean property had not been knocked down but rather converted into a free homeless shelter and soup kitchen.Worst of all the Thomsons home was replaced by a family of hillbillies who had turned the property into some sort of low budget bungee jumping attraction.They must have moved thirty broken down trucks into the front lawn immediately and kept what sounded like a pack of wild dogs in the backyard.Brent couldnt prove it but he suspected their youngest, Trevor, was the one responsible for the water balloon incident.Thats it. Brent muttered.It was time to sell, property value be damned.Surely the next neighborhood would be better.It certainly couldnt get any worse than this mess
