**[Hud, Orchish Warrior and Brother of Battle; Fort Courtyard]**
-----
A battle raged on at the gate.They had fought their way through the invasion force.Our warriors were slaughtered one-by-one, but gave two blows for each that slew them.A monster- no, a demon led the push against us.It dodged an attack, only to withstand the next.We could not stop it.The demon was more mighty than an elder tree trunk; darker, too.It was like a forest spirit's grace held within the form of a giant, hairy, baby orc.It's voice was as high as my last-loved mate, but my stomach churned when it screamed.It gave screams of rage, screams of pain; screams of fear.Worst of all, it gave the cry of the hunter of a feast, whom held the head chair.I did not want to share its hall or table.But this battle was a feast of war.We were not guests, and we were no longer the hunters.We were the hunted, no matter how many of us fought back.Imagine!A band of orcs, hunted!My Brothers fell slowly in our courtyard battle, only one at a time to its brutality.And it prowled, tireless, for the next of us to be pounced on.The last of us in the courtyard stood as a wall of might.We stood to halt it.This *demon* had no wings, and could not climb out.It would come to us to escape.We would fight to our death to keep it in the walls of our new fort.A giant crouched at our back, and a hand's worth of goblins stood between my few remaining Brothers of battle, while we watched another become prey.The demon killed its prey without mercy.Its mouth was on his broken, orchen neck, and he started to turn pale.His skin no longer resembled the Grass Sea; his skin turned to dirt.The demon screamed again, happy for the kill, fists to the sky as if to challenge the gods.Its prey's meat weighed against its sharp fangs.My Battle Brother's flesh gave way to the demon's maw, tearing the gash wider.My lifeless Brother landed.The howl stopped, and my Brother's eyes turned to milk before his body settled.His heart was empty.His soul had been slupred down the demon's gullet.It then looked to us, hungrily.The demon lowered its arms while it turned so its full chest could face us.Its body hid its strength well, but my eye had seen many experienced warriors come and go.The demon was just the size of any orc warrior, but its limbs held no fat.My eyes did not betray me as they ran across its body.There were scant, but even, spreads of fur across what few patches of skin could be seen.It bore battered, eleven armor.Its hair looked like blackened grass stubs, curled effortlessly.In the quiet, I could hear the demon sizzle.The sunlight roasted what skin we had revealed, slowly; too slowly.This monster cared not for pain.It cared for the hunt, the kill, the feast; another soul to swallow, whole.My eldest Battle Brother called us stand a line.I moved without knowing.Even the cowards stopped hollering; stopped banging on the gate and stood with us; strong.I could call them "Brother" again.*'Not cowards after all.'*

And then, the demon stepped towards us, with dirt colored corpses in its wake.The elves stood far back behind him, in their fancy stone doorways with shields and spears.Did even they not know what monster they had released?The clouds cast a shadow on the courtyard.Our ancestors had come to watch our final moments, ready to guide us on.The demon straightened itself and stood strongly.It was leaned to roar, but it only coughed a rumble, and wiped its shut maw.Our warrior's death dripped from its maw no more, as it stained the last clean spot of the demon's arm.Then it spoke in Elardian so fine that his terrible acts seemed to fade from my memory.But they could never disappear.Nor could the storm that broiled overhead."Hello!"He called before bowing.I didn't know what kind of trick this could be.He slaughtered so many of us, and on seeing us, he *bowed!* "I am Sal.And *you*, great orchen warriors, are not safe.So, I grant you a chance.You will drop your weapons and be sent home, alive and well, **or** I will consume you.One by one.It is your choice!Choose well."I looked to my Brothers, and then to my Eldest.He stood, taken by fear.His mouth revealed a tightened jaw."I'll say it once more.Surrender or die..." At least that's what I heard him say.I think.Smoke and lightning swooped down from on high, and I shielded my eyes, prepared for the end.The gods' jealousy was finished, and a black smudge was all that remained!It was vanquished!The elves stared at the spot in shock, then payed no mind!They brought their arms against us, overwhelming us with their now greater numbers!'*Was the beast expected to turn to smoke?!Were they truly so crafty?!We were spared from the troll, only to be left to the rats!'*

"...And I'd *hate* to..." I nearly stumbled, then stood, and looked around.My worn armor clashed against a wreck of a midwestern style kitchen, and the dust of the courtyard's battle spread through the air.The floor below me was singed, and a new, charred skylight blessed my presence.*'Finished, wooden covers?Glass window panes?Even, white paint job on the walls?Is that fake tiling?A light switch?!Electrical outlets?!ANOTHER HUMAN PERSON IN THE CORNER?!'*

I was taken aback!I looked at my hands, and squeezed, **hard**.Droplets of ooze fell from my hand, and dollopped the floor.Between the feeling of my fingers, and the sound of the sin as it finished dropping, I knew I was awake.*'Holy fext...'*

"WHAT THE FUCK?!"I screamed in genuine surprise.My vampire muscles really brought the strength of my voice up a notch.It almost sounded like a roar.My clean hand searched my short hair for answers while the other reached for my balance.Then I snapped my jaw shut.I had finally heard a whimper from the corner.
