My eyes felt crusty as I opened them, the glaring sunlight blazing a sharp shiver down my sweaty back.I swung my heavy legs off the bed and walked like a demented ape to the bathroom.Retching up last night's alcohol into the tiny, cracked sink, I thought about what I would need to do today and avoided looking in the mirror.Right, I thought, swallowing some beer to quiet the bees in my ears, I'll check on the GoFundMe page and see how much I have to spend on Jenna today.Although I wasn't always needed, it was better to be well stocked than be called to an event uselessly equipped- a frustrating saviour to my briefly loved girl.I uploaded the photos of some random facebook child from Germany, adding the usual, leukaemia this time and "Help get Aaron the treatment he needs!"Jenna's help does not come cheaply and I finish the warm beer while my clammy hands contrast dankly with my arid soul.The bug out bag by the front door lays crumpled, where I threw it down yesterday.I check the contents, yes, most things that Jenna needs are here.Tampons, pads, a stack of printer paper, fuse wires, a flashlight, credit card, my passport and a charger for her phone.I saw a Nintendo Switch at her house yesterday, so I head out the door with the bag.She's going to need a warranty for that, she never fills them out and I will be there, when she needs one.I will be there.
