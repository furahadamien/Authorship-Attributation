The outcome is always the point.It's always been the point.Nobody will thank me for doing this.Change a few parameters.Run the simulation.Validate the outcome.Deploy.I can't remember the last time I slept.My sleep has been fragmented, hardly existent.I have long forgotten my family, my friends, my old life.Last I checked I was considered deceased.There was a funeral.It's better this way.Nobody holds a funeral for monsters.They're dismembered, burned, cast out and buried at sea so that no-one would ever stumble upon their remains.No unmarked grave.No ceremony.Just get rid of their memory forever so that when they are forgotten, erased from the cliff notes, they truly die.I've lost so much weight.I hardly eat.I hardly move.This IV bag has sustained me well enough.I use a catheter.All I can seem to do is watch the screen.Change a few parameters.Run the simulation.Validate the outcome.Deploy.I haven't seen the sun in weeks.I forget what daylight looks like.I forget what the warmth of the sun feels like.All I can see is a holographic projection on the screen.It isn't real.But the results are.The countless bodies.The oceans of blood and tears.The flies and maggots feasting on the mountains of decaying corpses.The grief and pain, that's real.The hatred, that's me.The greed, narcissism, apathy, that's me.The dehumanization, murder, rape, and genocide...all me.It's horrible, but it saves the world.There are far worse paths for the Earth to take.It's a curse.Seeing all futures.Knowing this is the only path where some of life survives.Even some humans.All other paths lead to total destruction.Those paths are much colder.Everything is an ashy gray.Nothing grows.Nothing stirs but the restless winds.The once vibrant oceans grow dark and still.We reset the clock on evolution every time.It's killing me to do this.But it's necessary.Change a few parameters.Run the simulation.Validate the outcome.Deploy.
