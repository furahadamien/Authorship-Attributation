Bob picked up his three inch brush.Adolf looked on curiously as he didn't know what it was to be used for.Bob had painted big white clouds in a sky of deep phthalo blue.It wasn't the best looking sky, but it was still impressive.He couldn't imagine what Bob would use a three inch brush for, considering the painting to be done.Bob saw the confusion in Adolf's eyes.He explained, "I'm just gonna dip the brush in odorless thinner, shake off any excess, and then..."

In that moment Bob started smacking the brush back and forth on the leg of his easel.His hair jiggling as if it was one piece instead of thousands of little curls.He stopped, looked up at young Adolf, with a smirking mouth and a twinkle in his eye, he chuckled, "And you just beat the devil out of it."Adolf felt more confused than before.He was learning to paint, how ever would odorless paint thinner be used.Surely it would ruin an otherwise finely painted sky of clouds.Bob instructed, "All you do is lightly brush all these little clouds."As Bob brushed, Adolf could see what was happening.The cloud, lifeless before, began to come alive with motion.Wisps of titanium white and phthalo blue began to blend into swirls of wind.A smile came across the eager student's face.He began the process himself, feeling a new found exuberance for painting, realizing that within his easel he could travel to any place he could imagine, and create  lands so beautiful that people would long to go there.Now, thirty-two years later, Adolf looked on as the chamber filled with gas.The vapors looked of titanium white and Indian yellow through the small round viewing window in the chamber door.The screams began.And a tear rolled down his cheek as he remembered the broken promise to a man who gave him a gift greater than any treasure.The gift of imagination.
