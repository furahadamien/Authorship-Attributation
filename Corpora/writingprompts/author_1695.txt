I woke up this morning the way I usually do.Sprawled out on my pullout couch in my studio apartment to my alarm clock - coffee maker setting up a fresh brew.I crawled out of my bed, poured myself a bowl of Frute Chutes and started drinking my coffee.Afterwards, I went through the usual morning hygiene process, pulled on my slacks, white button up, wacky tie, and my black loafers and began my trek to work.Being incredibly rich and not blowing my money on luxuries is difficult, but I find it rather humbling.The money I make working for The Corporation I immediately give to charity.I don't need it.The money I had after my parents passed immediately went into a savings account and blew up to an exuberant amount a few years later.I couldn't access it until I was eighteen, but I never really needed it.My parents made sure of that.The only reason I work for The Corporation is to hide how much I really have.I'll continue letting the world think that the richest person is Bill Gates, or whoever it is.For now, I'll maintain my simple life.When I arrive to work, I immediately get an email from my boss the moment I punch in.He wants to see me in his office.Probably to offer me that promotion again.I keep telling him I don't want it.As I walk down the hall to his office, I notice my coworkers give me dodgy looks.Clearly, something's wrong."You wanted to see me sir?"I ask."Yes, sit down.We need to talk about your performance as of late."Mr. Baus says."Sir, if it's about the promotion, I haven't change my mind.I still don't want it.""You have one thing right, it is about the promotion.But I'm no longer offering it to you.Because of your lack of interest in moving up, I've decided you need to move out.Your fired.I always thought you were an excellent worker, but clearly you don't care about this company or your position in it.Please, gather your things and get out.If you're not gone within the hour, I'll call security."I sat, shocked, stunned, befuddled.I did so much for The Corporation.I'm getting fired for not wanting to move up the ladder?I'll show him.He'll regret the day he crossed me.I stormed out of the office, grabbed my things from my cubicle, and immediately left the building.I decided to walk home instead of calling a Ryde to pick me up.Gave me time to plan my revenge.Mr. Baus has no clue the amount of money I have and the expenses I'm willing to pay to make his life a living hell.I'll start by getting a PI to learn everything about him.Non-lethal allergies, the worst pet peeves, etc.I will constantly cause him stress and minor pain.He'll never know it was me.Everything that happens will seem like a minor inconvenience, but all together it will be the perfect revenge.I think, while I research a good PI, I'm going to let out all the air from Baus's tires.Not slash them, no, then he'd just get them replaced.I want him to put forth the effort of refilling his tires himself.Let the revenge plan begin...
