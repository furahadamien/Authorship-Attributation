They just don't get it.Uncounted times I've broken out and killed members of their team.Endless times they've bored me with speeches of Good vs Evil and not killing me because they're better than me.What a load of crap.Heroics, morals, honor, justice; what's it all really matter at the end of the day when I'm still alive and they've buried another pompous friend of theirs.They make me sick, holding themselves above everyone else, without even acknowledging they're the cause.Break out, scheme, kill, get thrown back in this cell, rinse repeat.It's almost laughable how reliable our little dance had gotten over the years really.In truth these "Heroes" who keep this revolving door going are my greatest accomplices, guaranteed immunity for my bribes, betrayals and murders, all because they *need* to be better than me.They couldn't possibly stoop down to my level.Because then I've won.In the end that's why I'll keep doing what I do best, with a little help from my "friends".They just don't get it...but I did a long time ago.
