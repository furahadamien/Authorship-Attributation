They say that neglect is the worst thing you can do to a child.It messes them up.It's worse than slapping them around, or telling them every day that they're garbage.They say that if you neglect your child, they'll develop all sorts of disabilities, learning, physical, social - you name it.If the neglect is severe enough, they'll never learn to walk or talk.Oftentimes, a neglected child ends up in an early grave.You can't ignore your kid, and especially not if that kid has only just been catapulted into life.A newborn baby is entirely dependent upon it's caregiver for sustenance.Can you imagine - a little pathetic sack of fat and skin and bone being able to maintain it's own flickering, barely-there life force?Impossible, you'd say!The rest of the world would agree.However, not many have heard the tale of little Albert, born in the freshly founded colonies to the most neglectful mother of all, a woman named Mary Molson who would have tossed her infant son in the river the moment he slipped free from her womb and stumbled blindly into her care, should her family and neighbors allow it.There were only forty-four men in the colony, and one of them was surely little Albert's father, except none would step into the name.If Mary Molson knew his face or name, she wouldn't say, perhaps out of fear that a marriage would naturally ensue.So she spent nine months pregnant, and gave birth in the corner of her shabby home without assistance.Once the grueling process was finished, she rinsed off the mess from her hands, her legs, and finally her son.She left him in crudely constructed bassinet (a gift from the colony's founder - it was, after all, the first english baby born in the lower americas) and left Albert to himself.Over the next few weeks, the colonists came in to coo over little Albert's bassinet and offer their half-hearted congratulations to Mary Molson.It wasn't long before the visitations stopped, as little Albert grew into his reputation as an ill-tempered child.His cries could always be heard, and as much as the colonists tried to help, nothing seemed to stop his tears."Is he tired?"they'd ask, "...or hungry maybe?"Mary Molson would wave away their suggestions and say, "Are you kidding?All he does is sleep and eat."Though, not once did anyone see little Albert doing either.Over time, little Albert gave up on crying.He spent his days and nights staring, wide-eyed and without expression at the sides of his bassinet.The fat layer coating his body slipped away to reveal the fragile bones beneath it.His lips became cracked, and discolored.Dark circles formed under his eyes.After a few months, his pinkish glow was gone and his skin began to shrivel up on itself.Little Albert was only just beginning his life, but his skin sagged and folded like he was a hundred years old.You may be wondering: how on earth did little Albert survive for all this time?Never sleeping?Never eating?Surely after three months of this torment, he would have turned to bone and ash!But that's just the thing: little Albert didn't die.He never did.Over the years, he continued on, quite normally in fact.He never ate, or drank, or slept.He simply...existed, just as he was born.Frozen in a state of complete independence.Albert isn't little anymore.He grew into a new, adult-sized body just like you'd expect of anyone else.If you saw him, you'd surely say, "Why that man looks a thousand years old!"You'd be right, or nearly so.Today, April 18th in the year 2624, Albert has turned nine-hundred.His face is sunken in, his skin is papery thin, and his voice rasps out like radio static.Each word falls out of his mouth slowly, past a crusted, powdery tongue, tripping down the long-dried up riverbed.Not once has a drop of water graced the surface of that tongue.If you asked for the secret to his longevity, Albert would happily supply it for you."How have I lived this long?"he'd say, an amused smile tearing the corners of his mouth."I'll tell you first humanity's greatest mistake.At some point in our history we compared ourselves, in all our rational wit and beautiful, never-ending creativity to the beast.We saw savage creatures pursuing pitiful pleasures like food and water, and we decided that was a fit venture for us, too.Our greatest mistake was assuming that our mouths were intended for anything other than language.Beasts drink.They eat, they drink, they pleasure themselves or each other with their disgusting, sloppy mouths.They intake the poison, again and again until it kills them.Humans were never meant for such perversion.We can live forever, so long as we refuse the temptations of the beast.""The poison.It's in everything.If anything touches your tongue, you have been exposed to it, and it takes it's hold.At first it's diluted.They get it only in tiny increments.Then the addiction sets in, and they're tied to it.They have to drink or they lose their minds.They'll scream for it!Endlessly, screaming!Then, it's not long until they start drinking the poison straight.Look at the masses!They do it hundreds of times a day, constantly swigging away at bottles, canteens, cups, and glasses, moving faster and faster toward their own death!They start consuming it in all forms.They become lost to the addiction.At that point, there's nothing that can be done.If they stop, the withdrawal effects of the poison will surely kill them, even sooner than it would otherwise.Hope is lost.They're locked into their own impending doom.""A cure?Sure, it can be avoided.Look at me!I'm nine-hundred years old.The temptation to drink doesn't even reach me anymore.If I die, it will be alongside the rest of humanity.Until then, I will continue on.Even as entire generations drop dead around me.""For you?No, my friend.I'm afraid there's no hope.You can blame your caregiver for that.They committed you to the poison before you could even lift your own head up.You were completely subject to their will, a clueless infant, unable to act on your own, and now, their ignorance has determined your fate.Look at you.Your smooth skin, your plump features...God I mourn for you, friend.You wear the face of human depravity."
