I've always seen them.The numbers.It took me a long time to figure out what they were, and longer still to learn to pretend they weren't there.My family took me to a psychologist when I was young, he thought they were a visual hallucination.None of the pills he proscribed me worked, but I pretended they did at the last batch.I didn't want them trying surgery.It wasn't long after I left school that I realised I could use this... talent... to be the perfect bouncer.I did pretty well for myself, ended up working the door of one of the bigger clubs in the city.That is why, late on a Friday night, I was winnowing through the line queuing up outside the club.The lights from the club over the street were bright and strobing, the music pounded through the air mixing with the shouts and laughter from the crowds stumbling and weaving their way between each raucous island of light and noise.I almost missed it, distracted by two drunks arguing across the street.A flash of an impossible number.My eyes must have been playing tricks, mixing two numbers from people stood close together.Surely.Then suddenly, there she was.She was stood in front of me, ID in hand.She had a nervous smile, her eyes were a pale green and her skin was almost luminous and smooth, pale as alabaster.Long hair tumbled about her shoulders, down her back.It was gold and yet it seemed like shimmers of silver cascaded through it when it caught the light.Above her head, impossible, floated the number  1391.I stared.Had I finally jumped off the deep end?Had I burst a blood vessel in my brain and my ability was going screwy?"Um... hello?Could I... um... go inside?Please?"Her voice was soft, she had an accent I couldn't quite place, melodic like singing.I startled out of my reverie and took her ID, "Sorry," I mumbled, examining the plastic card, checking it against our registry.It was real.Tara  White, aged 24.But I had never been wrong before.What the hell was going on?I handed the card back to her, "You can go in," I said stiffly.I couldn't bring her up on it.The ID seemed real and I couldn't hold up the line.Besides, what would it look like if I started asking if she was over a thousand years old?It was preposterous.The impossible girl gave a bright smile, "Thank you!"She vanished into the club and was gone.I was preoccupied for the rest of the night, it made it hard to concentrate on my job.Thoughts of the mysterious girl whirled through my head.Who was she?What was she?I did not see her again until the club wound down and emptied in the early hours, and in the flood of people leaving I did not realise she had passed me until I saw a flash of silver-gold rounding the corner.By the time I reached the next street she was gone.My heart fell.I'd lost her, my only chance at finding out about that damn number, gone.I was despondent the next day, I'd blown it.I'd never see her again.By the time midnight rolled around on Saturday I had managed to convince myself it was a fluke.I must have imagined that number... even if I knew in my heart that I had not.Still, it was the only way I could put the mystery out of my mind and I had almost succeeded when I caught those shy green eyes again in the queue.I looked up sharply, and sure enough the 1391 floated above her head mockingly.Beside her was a tall man, probably pushing seven feet.He had shoulders broad enough to make Atlas envious and his skin was as dark as her's was pale.He caught my eyes and the blood drained out of me.Terror, deep and primal washed through me.I felt like a gazelle staring into the eyes of a lion.For all those brown eyes were soft, they were deep and dark and I felt like I was drowning.He held out his ID, said nothing.Every motion was measured and precise, he moved not an inch more than he needed and there was a terrible fluidity about it.An effortless, predatory grace.It was only then that I realised what number was above his head and a new terror filled me, my limbs trembled and my heart seized in my chest.12,150.I swallowed hard, fumbled for the ID.It too was real.He was Alexander Roberts, aged 28.I handed it back, gestured for them to go in.I could not trust my tongue.The man gave a thin smile and ushered Tara inside.When they were gone it was like a heavy weight had left me and I gulped for breath.My hands shook.I took my break early and rushed to the staff bathroom, I splashed cold water onto my face.The shock of it helped but my hands were still trembling.I felt nauseous.Why had that man had such an effect on me?Who the hell *were* they?Thankfully I did not encounter the terrible man and the shy girl again that night, but over the next few weeks Tara became a regular.She would always come on the weekends, sometimes with her terrifying companion and sometimes alone.I quickly noticed that she was always sober when I saw her, no matter how late she had stayed at the club.She never seemed to leave with anyone, though she seemed to often get hit on in the queue and probably more often still at the bar itself.She always deflected these advances... at least the ones she noticed.A lot of the time she seemed to not realise she was being flirted with at all.She was always quick to smile, there was a shy earnestness about her and an almost frightening amount of curiosity.It made me wonder just how she was related to Alexander.The man still made me uneasy even if the terror of him had lessened.I waited until Tara came without her protector, as I had come to think of him.It was a Sunday night, the air was getting colder and the crowds a little thinner.She left the club early today and before she could vanish like she always did I called out to her, "Tara, I need to speak with you a moment.It is about your ID."She turned, confused, "Is there something wrong?""Your ID is fake, isn't it?You aren't 24.I can see people's ages.I know you are much older than that.You're nearly 1400, aren't you?"I watched her eyes widen slightly."Th-that is ridiculous, of course I'm not!No one lives that long," she protested, pulling away from me."I have never been wrong before.What are you?Who are you?"She looked around nervously as the crowds of drunks still wending their way to the last embers of revelry still smouldering in the early hours, "Not here.Come with me, and I will explain.I can't risk someone overhearing," she turned from me and gestured for me to follow.I had little choice.I had to know who she was, how she could be so old.I followed, and soon we were lost in the crowds.Whatever explanations my feverish imagination had come up with in the past few weeks, they paled to nothing in the light of the truth.**EDIT**

Apologies if there are any spelling mistakes or nonsensical sections.I wrote this on my phone and it has started to shove words I already did into the middle or end of sentences once I complete them.Such as turning "paled to nothing" into "patheyd nothing" or such.**EDIT 2**
