Baloucarps
I see walls covered with writings.I see floors painted with blood.I see surfaces, chairs, refrigerators and any available surface to draw on plastered with the same damn message.*"Whatever you do, Don't tell them you can see."*

Whispers of instruction fill my head."Hush.Do not speak of your sight."I follow blindly, just as I was blind before.Color, restored.But fear, still dwelling.I thought a life with color was worth living.Everyday, I crept onto the scene, acting blindly like I was.It was no difference to having sight, than losing it.Days turn into weeks, weeks turn into months.Somehow, it has become a chore to maintain such a gift.To have sight, but not be able to share it.To gain vision, but not be able to show it.Months turn into years.And the day goes on.Blindness has kept my sanity.Yet, vision has driven me mad.I look at the table.A pencil on the drawer."It's enough," I say."This will do."With force, I stab my left eye, blood gushing onto the scene!I cry, yet I remain silent.I see now what the warnings have been.I see now who has written them.With my blood, I draw at the table in front of me.A surface large enough for my message.I need to warn them.I need to tell them what will happen to them.Before I lose my sight, I write my one, last message I will witness.***"Whatever you do, Don't tell them you can see."***
