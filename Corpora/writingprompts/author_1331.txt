There were coke packets on shelves.I'd materialized again.The coke warehouse was filled with Colombian guards.The warehouse was in a rain forest, and the sound of tropical insects was deafening.I saw Anna, and wondered how the hell she got here.She was trapped right at the back of the warehouse, and was about to be discovered.She had golden hair, and freckled skin.She had been in the sun, and the sun damage didn't take from her beauty.I scuttled past a head-high pallet of coke, and arrived at the side of Anna."I'm in danger again, aren't I?"I said."How on Earth did you get here?""We need to get out of here," she said, "then I will explain.""I say we bonk one of those guards," I said, "and steal his machine gun."She agreed with my plan, because I was very good at materializing escapes after all the practice I had been given over the years.In fact, it was almost like I was incredibly lucky... like some guardian angel was watching over Anna and I. I felt a surge of adrenaline, and bonked a guard's head with my clenched fist.It made hardly any noise as he dropped to the floor.I extricated the guard's gun from his heavy, limp form, pulling and straining to get the arm strap from his armpit.Over the years of these dangerous situations, I'd learned what had happened to make me arrive at Anna's side when she was in danger.I made a promise to her when I was fifteen, but I never knew Anna would be such a thrill-seeker and adventurer.I knelt down trying to calm my breathing after the excitement of appropriating the gun.I closed my eyes and faded back to Anna's room when I was 15 years old, and she was 16, because of being held back in Mrs. Marion's grade 3.We sat there, on the floor in a room full of feminine, pink ballet stuff and gemstones, and stopped tongue kissing.I remember it well.I was disappointed when she disentangled herself from our embrace.She went to a bookshelf.She took a textbook on magic down.I just wanted to kiss; I didn't want to read, and do magic."I was suggesting," said Anna, "we do a spell to prove we are serious.""Aw gee, Anna," I said, "couldn't we just have faith about each other."However, she was quickly leading me outdoors.She took me to the path outside her house.She had a backpack.From it, she took chalk, candles, stones."Blimey, what are you doing?"I asked.She was silent, and drew a little circle on the concrete path."OK," she said, "sit down in this circle.We are going to caste a spell."She caste a spell.She read the magic textbook, which had amazing old-time, colorful language a bit like the Bible.What I gathered from it was she was telling Aphrodite that I would appear whenever she was in trouble.She then handed the text book to me, and said if I agree read the little paragraph at the bottom of the page.I read, "I promiseth, by Aphrodite's power, by the sun, sky and wind's four directions, on this day proceeding the half moon, to be at Anna's side whenever she beeth in turmoil, until I find the valuable black-ocean stone to cancel the spell."I read the words, and then, unsettling me, there was a solar eclipse.I was a little disconcerted about the solar eclipse, but I remembered the night before, on the news, they had spoken of it.I looked at Anna.She was a small sex dynamo those days, with porcelain face framed by exquisite, golden-blonde hair.I looked up at her as we hid behind the pallets of coke.I remembered the time we did the ritual not so fondly.I formulated a route out of the warehouse."Hey Anna," I said, "I plan to make a run for it covering us from fire with the spray of bullets from this here machine gun.Run straight behind me, Anna.Let's hope we make it.""I'll explain why I'm here," said Anna, "when, I mean if, we get out of here."I started the machine gun spray, and run with all my speed towards the exit.I killed two soldiers having smoko.I ran quickly.As I ran, I let the spray of machine gun fire spray towards the guards, hoping the element of surprise would work.If I scared them enough, they might be bamboozled enough to not even return fire.I kept the deafening roar of the machine gun up, as we ran.I looked back seeing if Anna was on my tail.She wasn't.She'd disappeared.I thought on my feet.Should I go back for her, or should I keep going?I thought of how I wouldn't make it if I ran back, and dying wasn't going to save anyone, so I kept going.I just hope she's alright.I ran out of the large warehouse door.The guards left a spray of bullets, as I ran into the rain forest, but I made it.I found a little brook, and waited there, while I tried to figure out what to do about Anna still being in there.I was sitting there, almost having caught my breath, when Anna appeared.Infuriatingly, she smiled.Then, she pulled a kilo packet of coke from behind her back."What the fuck?"I said angrily."Don't worry, I'll explain," she said.We started trekking through the forest, knowing the guards might send out a search party.I saw Anna carrying the coke."Give me that," I said.She gave it to me, and I put in in my cargo pockets."What the hell were you thinking?"I said."You always do stuff like this.I can't live with risking my life, every time you decide to go thrill seeking.""This is the last time," she said.I severely doubted it.Unless we broke Aphrodite's spell, she'd get in danger again.You see, we broke up the day after we made to spell out on the footpath near Anna's house.I'd told her I wanted to concentrate more on my indoor cricket team, and she didn't take it well.The next day she had a big, muscly boyfriend twice as good looking as me."What are you going to do?Break the spell?"I snickered."Yes," she exclaimed.I looked at her.I was dumbstruck."You see," she said, sitting on a rock to talk."I broke into that coke warehouse to acquire this bag of coke.Do you remember the wording of that spell?""No, not exactly," I said."The wording of the spell said if we could acquire a black-ocean stone, we could do a new spell to counter the spell that makes you appear when I'm in danger, which is often because I seek thrill, and am a adventurer.""Go on," I said, realizing this might actually work."I Googled black-ocean stones," she said, laying back on the rock, "and they are darn expensive... about $20 000.""Aw damn," I said, disappointed."No wait," she smiled."This is a kilo of coke," she said, raising the white bag, "Do you know how much this is worth?""Lots," I said."It's got a street value of, exactly that, $20 000."I looked at her thankfully.She planned to free me from the magic spell.We got into Rio, and bought a black-ocean rock from a jeweler.We did quick spell, with chalk and candles, much like the first, and there was a solar eclipse."I'm sorry we didn't work out," I said."Don't be sorry," Anna smiled, "We were young.Nothing holds a teenager's attention for long.""How'd that indoor cricket go?""I still play," I said."But now girlfriends take precedent.""Bye," she said."Bye," I said.This time I knew it was goodbye for good.I felt sad, as I faded away back from Brazil to home.Just as I had faded from home to the Brazilian warehouse for the last time.THE END.
