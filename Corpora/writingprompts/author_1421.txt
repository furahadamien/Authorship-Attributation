"Isn't it already useless?""Yeah!Let's just throw ourselves off one of the tall buildings or something?""Great idea!It would be quick and we won't hurt as much"

"Shut up!"In this almost empty world that I'm trying to protect, I find Francis, alone and walking down the empty streets as he gripped on to a broken piece of glass with his one hand and held his hand with the other.I know this man very well.I've watched him since the start of this world's great tragedy.He's the only one left in this world that hears the voices of those that don't exist.He is the only one who hasn't listened to them...yet."Just leave me alone already!I've been dealing with all your bullshit since before this world became this fucked up!I just want you to be quiet", he screamed.Tears flowing down his face as paced around with a hand that held on to the glass shard that was now dripping with his blood.I watched him quarrel with the voices that pushes him to end it.I watched him throw things at people that aren't there.Hurt himself because he wanted to punch one of them out of frustration.His quarreling with them was a normal occurrence but today was very different than usual."Just kill yourself already!We're getting bored here"

"Kill yourself!Kill yourself!Kill yourself!""No one's left to love you anyway.It's better to just die, right?"I used to not feel anything when I watched those that had the same problem as him, take their lives away in order to escape the voices that plague them in this desolate world.It was my job to not care...but now its different."Why don't you guys stop right there?", I said to the people that aren't even there."Goddammit!Not another one", he groaned to himself as he crouched down to grab his head."And who the heck are you?", asked one of the voices."...Who I am is not important.What's important is that you let him have his quiet"

"Yeah?And why should we care what you think?""Because I know your reason for doing it"

This voices are just like me.I am "alive" because humanity is still alive.The only reason they are alive is because Francis is alive."If you think that's enough to-"

"You think your existence is a waste because you could never interact with the real world.You bully him because you can never take it out on anything other than him.All of you are sicknesses, a disease, parasites who's sole reason to live is to torment whoever you host because you were never born...but I will need to stop you now"

I cut the leeches that stuck on to his soul."Children that couldn't receive the warmth of life.Rest now and hope that the future will gift you that warmth"

It was never in my jurisdiction to take the souls of the living when they do not have the shroud of death looming over them but these children are different.They were never born, so they never lived."T-They're gone!"I could have let them stay if they only helped him rather than torment his mind with words that served no purpose other than to break him."They're finally gone!!"I just hope that their souls find the peace that they wanted."Thank you!Thank you, so, so much!"Francis bowed his head deeply on to the ground as the sound of sobbing fills the streets with noise."There should be a camp nearby if you continue walking straight.You should join them and try to live together"

I left him there as he continued to cry tears of joy for the silence that he finally received.I can't console him as he will become dependent on the idea that I will be there to help him.I want him to grow accustomed to his mind from here on out....

Stay strong...This parasite still needs you and all the others to be around.Live so you grow and increase in numbers... then, when the world becomes able to function once more...I will pass this baton back to Life and be the fetcher of souls that I had always existed to be.
