[Im] - immortal

[Tt] it was on my prepubescent age that i realized i had been time traveling already.It was an unconscious thing before then, and i'd always see my parents with tears of joy when i greet them.Apparently they couldn't figure out if i was kidnapped or just ran away.When i told them what i could do i was already growing facial hair.And they thought i was insane.Until the psychiatric ward tested me on it.They made it impossible to guess what number would show up on the computer.I'd simply go back in time to repeat what i saw.I thought it funny to write one down, since it had been 12 digits, i couldnt remember that.So, they proved i could see the future, tell them the next week's headlines, and even prevent a catastrophe or two.My parents finally believed me for what seems to be 2 years later.My sense of time cant be trusted anymore.And then an agency designed to help me with my logistics of temporal location showed up to me.I believed i was an adult at this time.But they told me with a quick scan i might just be 17 years old by a normal boy's age."Normal"...  what is that?Changing my setting by a thought was what is normal.The presence of constant change and the lack of a steady pace was what i was used to.Time was nothing to me.The people, the places, the monuments could all change at the blink of an eye.But there will always be something there.[Im]  just when i thought i had seen everything, now this.I was a quiet type until i met him.I had read every page written for entertainment, broken down the meaning of each letter of each language.Evolved my own intuition to a sense of glorious normality.Everything that is wonderful would be boring to the average man.You know, those that could only live a century.I am immortal, they said.Help society, they said.I scoff at the thought.I meet people, they  proliferate, they die.I make friends, they enamor me, they too must pass.Yet, those i grow to love never once leave my memory.They dont encompass my daily thoughts but the love is still felt for eons.I would not help a damn soul or organization again i thought.Their purposes are self destructive and pathetically misguided.They know not what they see before them.They know not what will come for them.Even the most intelligent, the most assured man to have claimed knowledge has knelt at the passing of time.And so i wander.Internally and out.Searching for what i believe to be important.And enjoying playing a part until that game is over.But i swear, this industrial revolution is something else.We could consider it magic to have come this far.It felt like yesterday the sticks that kept me warm help me find the stones that let me rest.I reminisced of dirt on my feet.It made me wonder if i could go back and change anything.That is such a youthful thought.Having repeated humanities flaws enough has taught me a lesson.Time, is the only thing i know.I flow though it as gently as a water particle in a river.Steadily, Knowing not my size or place i keep moving forward.Time is the only thing i can count on.[Tt]  I met him when
