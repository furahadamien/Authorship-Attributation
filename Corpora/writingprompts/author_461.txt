Rebyll
I look out the viewport of the Arcadian spacecraft, at the shrinking blue ball I've lived on my whole life.Life on Earth sucked.A bout a hundred and fifty years ago, the global economy collapsed.Apparently, Germany was stuck bailing Greece out when Greece went broke.Then Britain left the EU, the United States ruined their own  economy which caused an economic collapse all over the world.Apparently, though, my great great great great grandfather, before all this, bought me a newly discovered star in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way.Our interstellar neighbors.Now, space is a big place, and that despite humanity's discoveries so far, there *is* other life out there.As evident from the reason why and the method by which I'm leaving the small blue planet."Your grace, we are underway, as you can see.Once we clear the solar system at sublight speed, we'll use our FTL drive to reach the seat of Arcadian power, The Apex," my liason, a slender Arcadian named Silea, informs me.Arcadia is the name we gave to the star, and when I was contacted by their representative, they liked the name.Due to my nationality being American, my language is English and because of my ownership of the star, the official language of the Arcadian Empire is also English.They learned my language by studying us from afar.The Arcadian people are humanoid, with skin ranging from pale grey to almost ivory, with a few outliers having skin colors closer to human tones.They only have three fingers on each hand, but I haven't seen their feet.All of the Arcadian crew I've encountered so far have been wearing thick boots.Their eyes are normally purple or blue, and they don't have pupils like we do.Their eyes are colored black all around except the color in the middle, where a human iris and pupil would be.Their legs are jointed the same as ours, as are their arms.There aren't many physical differences, I'm not sure about the insides, but their true capabilities lie in their minds.Arcadian minds are much more capable than humans are: even the average Arcadian teenagers can understand complex quantum mechanics, and the inner workings of both their own biology, and that of other species."Thank you Silea," I reply, "And you can just call me Alex."The Arcadians have empathy for everyone, and their senses are attuned to peoples' emotional states so that just by a touch or a close look, and any Arcadian can figure out how you're feeling.Unfortunately, such gifts bear a price.It isn't that they have an innate need for the blood of other creatures or something to keep them alive, but that their society and leadership have become very arrogant.The Arcadians are a civilization that stretches across four star systems, a fledgling empire with one goal in mind: to unite the galaxy against the threat of cosmic extinction.The one thing the Arcadians were able to figure out is that there's something bigger out there.And to truly get their job done, they needed a leader.The leader which, due to grandad's purchasing of a star for his son when he was a kid, is now me.Such knowledge came at a price, however, and that was getting themselves into a war with the inhabitants of the planet Eayn that the Arcadian...I mean, our forces couldn't win.Not without new leadership.Which is why they got their new Emperor.Me."Of course your grace," Silea ignores my request due to a strict adherence to protocol.In the Arcadian military and government, respect is demanded of one's superiors, as I have come to learn from her.This type of rigidity is what got the Arcadians into their current mess in the first place.So, it's up to me to correct this behavior now.It's up to me to lead."I mean it.I don't want to be 'your grace' this or 'your eminence' that, or 'yes my Emperor' or 'no my Emperor' and crap like that.I need to be able to talk to people without them being scared of me," I press my point, though secretly, I know why Silea is acting so stuffy.See, Arcadians are good at reading emotions, but when you grow up on the streets of Washington DC like I did, with parents who were killed in a car accident, you learn that there are people who will destroy you if given the chance, and you learn to spot them real easily.Which is why I can tell Silea's feelings from looking at her almost as well as she can tell mine just by looking at me.It's how I know she's got feelings for me, even though we met only two hours ago.And it's how she probably knows I've already got a crush on her too.
