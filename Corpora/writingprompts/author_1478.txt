Another day, another morning full of "surprises".I walked outside my small house and sat down on my front porch.I reached into my shirt pocket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes."Really?You're still smoking?"The small screen on the front was my face looking back at me.Ever since technology advanced people started to realize just how bad smoking was.A few months ago I was one of two smokers and the surgeon general's warning would rotate around the pack on a small screen.Now that I'm the last one, things are getting personal.My face on the pack was programmed to look at me in shame and say the same thing over and over.I just chuckled a little to myself.I pulled one out and lit it up, and let the smoke swirl around me.It's been two weeks since the jack, the other smoker, died.Ironically enough, it wasn't lung cancer that killed him, it was an anti smoking mob.They cornered him in an alley and beat the ever loving snot out of him.No one found out who did it, they just looked the other way because he still smoked.I took a drag of my cigarette and let my head tilt back.No one would ever understand why I smoked, only jack did, and now he's gone.The things I did for this country, I still have a tremor in my hand.I brought my head up to see a billboard flash and produce a picture of my face, and it began to morph into a disfigured, yellow teeth, version of myself.I laughed, like that could ever happen.I finished my cigarette and threw it in the ashtray next to me.I shook my head as yet another billboard flashed another anti smoking ad at me.They won't get me to quit by getting personal, I'll quit when I'm ready.My phone's alarm went off and I shuffled back inside, it was time to get ready for Jack's funeral.
