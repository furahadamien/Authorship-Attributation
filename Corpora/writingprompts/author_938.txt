I gave my suit another look over in the mirror.There can't be any imperfections.The one to discover immortality has to look good after all.This will be remembered forever.I will be remembered forever.No, not remembered.Worshipped.I did the impossible.I tricked the Devil himself."Speak of the Devil", a smooth voice rang out across the room, "and he shall appear".And there he sat in the corner of the room.His pasty white skin seemed to absorb the darkness in the room.The pentagram brand visible upon the right side of his neck seemed to contrast starkly against his skin.His neat three piece suit had ash flickered onto it as though he was just standing amidst a burning building.His hair was combed to the side and his goatee had a neat trim.The hair was jet black with a ginger hue that wasn't noticeable at first glance but... well, I've spent plenty of with him.He stayed near every step of the way.It was a surprise he didn't find out sooner.But he definitely knew now.His brow was furrowed and his mouth was turned down into a scowl.His expression didn't seem angry.Mostly disappointed, almost disgusted.But his eyes gave it away.His eyes fixed onto mine.They seemed to burn with the hellfire itself.The fire I would be destined to suffer in for an eternity.*Only if I failed, which I didn't* I corrected in my head.His frown morphed into a sly smile "So what now?You beat me.You won.", he asked with a voice that dripped with resentment."I...I sell it."I answered hesitantly.He gave a curt scoff and replied "Of course you're going to sell it.Humans always have such simple aspirations.At least you did it.Didn't think you would.""You knew?"The inquiry had shocked me to say the least."You really think I didn't?"His eyebrow raised.He smiled once more.This time it seemed genuine.Like he was amused by the fact that I though that he didn't know.It was odd, he seemed like an ordinary man.Handsome, charismatic.But he held such horrible power."I knew from the start.But I respected the deal.I wasn't gonna stop you... How'd you do it again?"It was disheartening to know he was onto me from the beginning.But I suppose he deserved to know how I did it."I found a way to connect the soul to the-"
"I don't really care."He interrupted, "I came here to warn you"
He stood and slowly began to stroll over to me.My heart began to rise into my throat "Warn me of what?", I asked "You can't hurt me."He laughed when I said that.Fear began to gnaw at my abdomen.*Could he hurt me?*
"Trust me, I could if I wanted to."He gave me a friendly pat on the shoulder."But it's not me you need to be afraid of..."
My breathing stopped.He couldn't mean...
"You don't try to play God...I learned that the hard way..."  He explained as he rubbed his brand.A deep pain on his face.But once again he gave me a cocky smile.He dropped something onto the table in front of me.Fear kept me paralyzed in place.I couldn't look at it.He began to leave and turned as he opened the door to say,"See ya soon"

He was gone.I was alone again.Sweat had drenched me.Terror made my heart beat heavily in my chest.My throat was scratchy and dry.I felt as though I was going to cry when I remembered he left something for me.I didn't want to look but I needed to and so I gazed down at what he had left me.A cross... A simple wooden cross.No embroidery or fancy metals.Made of cheap wood.The handiwork was simple, a child could have made it.That told me everything.Hell awaited me, but Satan wasn't going to be the one to cast me there.
