(*he's got a ghost arm*)

(*Hampton Ram's arm*)

Young Hampton Ram he was just sixteen

Working in a factory on the slicing machine

Designed to cut meat quite lean

It didn't quite work but he couldn't just quit

So Hampton stuck his arm inside of it

With a great big slash everything just changed

His right arm got disengaged

When he first woke up he realized his arm wasn't there

Painful, he cried, cause He could feel it still,

and make ghosts abide

He was much more unique than that ghost kid who flies

It was then Hampton knew what he had to do

He had to punch all the ghosts that are haunting you

He's here to fight whacking ghosts blue

He's gonna punch them all cause' he's Hampton Ram

Wow his name sucks but he's *Hampton Ram*
