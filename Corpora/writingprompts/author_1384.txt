"Hey honey," I said, "I want a ton of Karma, and am too damned lazy to come up with an original post.""Well, that's you being you, dear- you've been a lazy fuck since the day I met you.""I know- I'll just re-state the header of an existing reddit post, and re-present it as my own.No one will be the wiser!""Yep- that's the lazy, stupid fuck I married."24 hours later, I was surprised!"Wow- over 17 thousand karma, for posting someone else's idea!Who says originality and imagination matter on Reddit?I'm gonna do this again, next week- perhaps I'll post that thing about Johnny Cash not allowing "ring of fire" to be used in a hemmerrhoid ad- that has been only posted five time in the past month.""You're getting worse, every day, dear.I'm leaving you for the homeless meth head who,lives behind the k-mart dumpster.You could post that as a writing prompt, but since it's new and original, I doubt you will.""Sorry- I can't hear you, over the sound of my furious wanking!"
