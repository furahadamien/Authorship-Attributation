The bed bugs hid everywhere.They survived over a year of every manner of attempted extermination but they were too resiliant and to stealthy.Their host had moved twice and still couldn't get rid of them.The third appartment was different.The bed bugs had company.The first day they spread out to explore their new home but only half returned.Some told stories of the ultra territorial ants ripping at them with their powerful mandibles and relentless house centipeds who just rushed at them and tried to eat them.But the most horrific was the spiders.As they explored they saw their brethren caught in webs - some still struggling to escape in obvious futility.As they scuttled away they heard the spider hiss: "You don't fuck with our human"
