JFK, huh?Barack thought back to the last time he had heard anything about him.It had been one of those first nights in the White House when his curiosity had gotten the best of him.He'd asked about the conspiracies.Not just one or two - all of them.Most of the answers he received were pretty disappointing, but JFK - now that was interesting.When he had asked what had happened - who had killed Kennedy and from what location, the sheepish looking historian from the CIA got an odd look on his face."Um, we don't, really know..." How could they not know?There was a body wasn't there?"Well, no, not exactly..." Barack was intrigued, and though he wanted to follow up he was soon distracted by his healthcare reforms and the day-to-day chaos of running the country.Of course, in retirement, he finally had time to dwell upon the mystery, though he was now distracted by something even more important - family.Until the letter arrived.Could it be?Could JFK still be alive?And why would he be contacting a former president?Uncertainty gripped Barack as he slowly pulled out his smartphone and began dialing."I know you have questions."A silhouette said from the doorway of Barack's study."I don't have all the answers."The shadow of a man stepped forward into the light, revealing a handsome figure with a familiar visage.Taken aback, Barack tried to remain as calm as possible, considering the impossible circumstances.He put the phone down.Must have been a test."You...sent the letter, uh, Mr.President?""I did."The figure stepped forward with his hand outstretched, offering a handshake in greeting."Jack Kennedy, at your service."His hand felt real.The face looked real.And, Barack thought, there hadn't been a body all those years ago...

"Ok. Let's say I believe you.What are you doing here?"Kennedy sighed."Son, the answer to that goes all the way back to Dallas in 1963.And like I said, even I don't know everything.What I do remember is riding in the motorcade and suddenly finding myself in the future."When Barack cocked an eyebrow, Kennedy quickly clarified."No, not this 'future' - a more distant one, one where - and hold on to your chowder - time travel exists.""Uh huh."Well, it made as much sense as everything else so far.When talking to a living, breathing JFK, Barack figured, time travel was as obvious to him as GOP obstructionism."But what exactly does this have to do with me?""We're almost there.Once I discovered I was in the future I ran straight to the library to see what I missed.I wept for Bobby and I celebrated our space program.And I must admit, the conspiracies surrounding myself brought me a few good laughs.Eventually though, my research brought me to The Moment, right here in 2017."The Moment?""This is it, Barry.The moment when humanity realizes time travel is possible.The moment when I - when I die.For real this time."Kennedy went silent, and was now looking at the ground.Barack processed what Kennedy had just said.If he was implying what Barack thought he was implying..."No, no.You can't mean that.""I'm afraid I do, son.I need you to kill me."
