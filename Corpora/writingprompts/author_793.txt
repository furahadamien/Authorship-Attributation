Gluttony let out a big belch.As much as I love this rainbow cotton candy ice cream from Ben & Jerrys, it feels unfair that Pride gets his own month and we dont, said the bloated sin.Wrath nodded furiously.Celebrating a 50 year riot is great though.Guys...its GAY Pride Month not PRIDE the Sin Month, retorted Pride.Uhh, well if theres Gay Pride Month, why isnt there a straight pride month? chimed in Envy.Because thats not what Pride is about!Its about the LGBTQ+ community! 

I agree...it should be about loving everyone, said Lust seductively.The six deadly sins agreed.I guess that settles it.We know what Pride Month is truly about.

Just then, the Pride Parade passed by.A bail bonds company passed by with a sign that says we exploit everyone, no matter who you love. A defense contractor float drifted by, with a banner saying anyone can be a war criminal, no matter your sexual orientation. And a large procession of Chick-Fil-A cow mascots passed by waving massive rainbow flags.Greed, the Sins said in unison.
