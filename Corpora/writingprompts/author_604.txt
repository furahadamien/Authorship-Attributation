It was strange to think my sister was at one point a supervillain.The girl who was scared of the dark, liked to play house with her dolls, and wore nothing but pretty pastels.You'd think she would be the kind of woman that would become a trophy wife or an equestrian rather than a mastermind that single handedly brought our city to its knees time and again for close to a decade.I recall during her peak that I'd often have to stay home because of the physical similarities between us and often found myself terrorized by her victims or their families.To say it was bittersweet when she was finally defeated would be an understatement.Still, I found myself at our family home, in her room and struggling to contain my tears.Our parents kept it exactly how she left if when she decided her "career"; maybe hoping that sweet little girl would one day return.I can't blame them for it but really, even if she decided to hang up her supervillain crown, there is no "normal" for our family anymore.The vandalism on both mine and the family home should've been a glaring indication of that.The ReWire system had failed us as even after she was captured, they have us in limbo as they wait for more paperwork.As I walked around, examining the familiar furniture with passing interest, my eyes came to rest on a strange sight.A small stack of newspaper clippings that looked completely new compared to the dusty interior of the room.I walked curiously to the stack and found they were nothing more than clippings of my sister's more infamous stunts.Probably some vandal trying to terrorize us with this passive aggressive BS.However I felt drawn to looking at them closely.As I looked at each, I noticed something odd.My sister had always prided herself about her perfect skin.It was something she always liked to rub in my (pimply) face as a teenager.However, in every one of these pictures of her, her faces was married with faint scars and blemishes.Each picture with almost identical markings meaning it would be almost impossible to be a printing error.So why did she look more like me?Like...me...?In a single instance, it all made complete sense.The pieces falling into place like the clippings that slipped and floated to the ground.I felt the breath leave my body but I felt the rise of a cackle slip through my teeth.It had worked!I gave my sister to the ReWire authorities and they wiped her instead of me!I went ahead and rewrote my own memory to make it impossible to completely wipe my memory.I beat it.I actually beat the system!I doubled over as the laughter began to escape my throat with growing intensity.The fit seemed to last forever like I had finally had a long-due release but I quickly composed myself after allowing it.It was time to plague the city with a "new" reign of villainy.I. have.returned.
