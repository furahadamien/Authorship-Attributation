I don't remember much about being twelve except playing by the lake every day after school, pretending to be a contestant on a survival show.My older sister was sick of the game by then, always begging that we go inside and watch TV.Even if it's SurvivorMan."Anything," she insisted.I had wanderlust from a young age, and couldn't bear to stay inside for even a minute.Later in life, my  girlfriend would leave me for that fact - I couldn't stay in one place for very long.When I was fourteen, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia.My psychiatrist at the time hinted that my mother's heavy psychedelic use during pregnancy gave it to me, but I don't believe that.It felt like I had special sight instead of a disease - not to the rest of the world, though.My mom cried herself to sleep almost every night.I didn't have friends.Eight years after that, thanks to my medicinal 360, I was on top of the world.My meds eased every symptom, but I could still see faint green and red lines sometimes.Sometimes, I traced the green line, like to a stranger's dorm party where my love Ruby, unknown to me, was at the end of the green line.I found other great, less important things, with that green line.Jobs, good books, awards ceremonies.But one day, the green line curved until it was completely pointing to my own self."Is that it?", I wondered.Was there nothing else?I don't know why, but it bored me so much to think about not having a path to follow.God wasn't giving me the answers anymore.It was like staring at the credits at the end of a video game.The red line, however, was not finished with me.I followed it down the street to the bus stop.I watched it project onto the patterns of the seats and on the wings of a plane until I landed in Chicago, Illinois.I followed it to an office building and to some stranger's office.I pushed aside my growing unease, but I couldn't stomp the insecurity.I had never doubted the very steps I took before.I knocked on the office door and a man who looked exactly like me answered.His hair was short and he had dirt under his nails, but there was no doubt he was my copy.I can't describe how icy I felt."I've been looking for you a long time", he said.And, without warning or explanation, he killed me.
