"Wait, what?So you never dehydrate because... You _soak?_  What the hell does that even mean!?"The deep booming voice echoed in the distance."Like a wet potato.I just soak, I don't drink.When I was a kid, the town idiot told me everyone who drinks water dies so I stopped!"I explained, as I laid tied to the stone alter."How do you not slurp any up if you're so thirsty!?"Another far less scary voice inquired."Quiet, Kenny, I'm the one who does the questions, remember?"The once booming voice responded quietly and less intimidating."I piss in it!"I explained while attempting to move my head towards the direction of murmuring voices."He's messing with us.Soaking in water instead of drinking it?That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."Said one woman."Russel, what about the ritual?"Another voice added."There will be no ritual today, Kenny.We'll have to take his word on it."The leader responded."You there, immortal one.We have been tracking you through the generations.This group was formed by our forefathers long ago, and as it was foretold, we have found you and brought you here tonight to harness your life energy!"The leader explained."You're a bunch of weirdos."I responded quickly."Yeah, and I wasn't even hiding.You guys picked me up at an In-and-Out burger.Did you even grab my burger for me or did you just stuff me in the bag and go!?""I think Eddie ate it."A small voice answered."Did not!"Eddie contested."Jesus Eddie, you're supposed to be on a diet."The leader scolded."Listen, I can appreciate how much time and effort went into your little ceremony here, but if you could just untie me and move this along?That would be great."I demanded."SILENCE!"The leader commanded."You will now reveal the source to your ancient and mystical power.""Don't drink the water!It's that simple.Just soak in it, Christ almighty.Is anyone else in charge here?"I pleaded."Clearly after hundreds of years of existence, you've grown extremely wise and now you're attempting to trick us by acting like a simpleton!"The leader said in a sinister voice."Uh, well, you'd think so, but sadly, no."I answered back."What now?Do we torture him?"A voice asked the leader."I didn't sign up for that."Another voice scolded back."I guess we'll let him go."The leader finally said."This has been the most disappointing culmination of a cult's grand prophecy I've ever heard of."
