I just called 5 Congress people this morning.It's super easy.You just leave your message as a voicemail or with a staff member.It's their job to listen to you.They want to hear you.I just told them "I want to make sure (insert Representatives name) is going to speak directly with the leadership of the FCC and make sure they know that net neutrality is critical to our country."
