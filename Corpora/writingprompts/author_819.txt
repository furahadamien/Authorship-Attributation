"Get the fuck down boy!"Pax wispered.He shoved me down into the dry cracked ground, dust filling my nose and eyes."If you sneeze I'll fucking kill you!"I buried my face in my hands as hard as I could.If I made a sound, the scout-demon would notice us in a blink of an eye.He crouched behind a large rock and pulled me close enough for me to smell his rancid breath.The landscape around us was unforgiving, a smell of rotten eggs permeating the air.Pax was a Roman.A real fucking Roman.His olive-hued skin was constantly sweating in the hot furnace that was Hell itself.He towered over most of the damned humans in hell.His coal-black hair fell in locks over his forhead, and his heavy brow made his hateful eyes seem deep set.He wore the skins of slain enemies, and though most of them were the skins of demons, a lot of them was human too.You see, clothes in hell are scarce.The demons sometimes wear ceremonial garments in deep red.Some of our warriors stole them in the beginning of the rebellion to wear, but it became more fashinable to simply wear the skins of demons in the long run.It may seem macabre, but you need to remember, we are in hell.It makes rank much simpler too.A warrior with a lot of skins and fetishes from bone, horn and claw will demand your respect.A warrior without may become your next piece of clothing."Listen boy."Pax said, his voice low."I want that whoresons wings".He pointed to the scout.The demon was a winged horror of claws and fur.It had a face full of eyes and teeth and looked like a horrible mix between a manticore and a spider.It had at least eight clawed legs, wings and horns jutting out without any sense of pattern or intelligent design.It was crouched low on the side of a cliff ahead.Pax grinned."Grab your pilum"  


We readied our throwing spears, made fron the hollow bones of scout-demons.They were sharpened to a point and dipped in poison."This will show those bastards who are the real hunters in hell" Pax mused.
