WarriorsofAsgard
As the mind fades and the soul exits he can fill something pulling him in.First it was darkness then.Drunken ramblings and yelling?Mortal a voice as rough as stone but as calm as wind echoes into his ear.you stand before Odin chieftain God of the Asgardians.You have died well in battle taking many with you and..... is that a spatula?It is oh great one

How can such a warrior be worthy to rise into Asgard with such a weapon as his instrument?


Oh great Odin it is quite simple really.A great warrior fights with a sword or axe a brilliant warrior is able to fight with anything

Indeed.tell me  how many did you take down? 

12

You killed 12 people with a spatula?

Yes 

Odin looks into the shadows and sees a gruff man with a dog by his side


Brutal.Alright youre in

Around Odin his council looks onwards what about our word


Odin turns his head towards them  he killed 12 people with a fucking spatula.I dont need your council with this one
