My story starts like many others, I was the oldest child off 10 to a pair of farmers, I had one little brother at 8, a little sister at 3, and a litteler sister at 8 months, my parents married young, and had been gifted a fair bit of land from the local baron due to my fathers accomplishments in the barons army.I helped with the farm since I was young, and I expected my life to end as it started, on a farm.However I was close to getting that goal completed when a Necromancer, the former court wizard of the baron felt spurned, turned to necromancy, killed everyone.My family was just more biomass for his undead army.And let me tell you, seeing my smaller siblings brutally murdered in front, caused my former sound mind, to be less so, I managed to survive with near crippling wounds, saved by a young girl, well older then I was at the time, but still a young girl, who dabbled in healing magic, it was kinda odd since only priest knew healing magic, but I cared little for such things as semantics regarding magic.But a fire of revenge had started in my heart, and thus started my adventure to kill the necromancer.I was odd for a new and upcoming hero, always so angry, I mean people liked me well enough, but whenever i saw a small child, I felt intense rage and envy, why could not that child have died, instead of my brother and sisters?Two years later the necromancer turned into a lich, and created enough hoo-haa to have the king step in and offer a great reward, I was still young, I had trained but it was not until i turned 17, which also two years after the lich event, such a coincidence with these years, i tell you, but i digress.With support from the king, I had good gear, a trusty team of compatriots, and the girl that saved me some years prior.I went to the Lich's Castle, beat his body into dust, and had his phylactery for lunch, a miniature pig.But that did not get me far, the brutality I killed the lich with, I did not even allow his soliloquy, I did not enter the castle from the front, but climbed up the back.Apparently it was bad manners to not complete the 'castle' it was bad manners to kill the villain before he could speak a hole in my head, so long story short, I got cast out, my friends turned their back on me, I lost everything.It was at that moment I kinda understood where the lich came from, betrayed of spurned by the baron probably, I would have known the story if i did not kill him upon sight.So I turned into a villain, I killed the king, took his daughter as my wife, and she oddly fell for me not long after I brutally murdered her family, and so began my reign of terror, I just never expected it to go this far, I made a happy family with the princess, and I managed the lands well, thanks to a good supply of legendary hero gear, and as the list of heroes killed grew, more 'villains' came to join my cause, and all of them turned villain due to betrayal, I offered them a spot and put clear limitations on their actions, instead of "Yeah sure, do w/e magic you will" and then go "You meddled with necromancy, you shall be banished from the castle!Guards take him away!".There was a crazy person or two, but killing them was easy enough.The amount of heroes coming grew and grew, I honestly don't wanna spend my life killing heroes that instead of attempting to murderkill me, decided to speak and yammer, and monologue and dear god, have mercy, so I fake my death, put out the story about how my half-twin brother, from different mothers ended up killing me, oh and he had my name.From there I had some guy to step in as king, and I turned the land behind the castle into a nice potato farm, and as such, my adventure has ended.
