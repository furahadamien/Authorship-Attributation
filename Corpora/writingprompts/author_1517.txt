"Terry, do you know where you are?Why you are here and who I am?"It was a small pale, closet-like room they were sitting in.Terry looked around for a second noting the clinical plainness of the walls and the sterile metal chairs and table he was sitting at."I'm being interrogated.You're the one they sent to 'talk' to me.""I'm only here to ask you a few questions.We have a lot we need to clear up."The man opposite Terry made his response without dropping eye-contact.He was also fat with greying curly hair and a face of feigning sincerity.In other words, he looked like a good cop, but there was no bad cop to back him up."Who's 'we'," Terry asked."You and me, of course," the fat inquisitor genially answered."It's just us having this conversation.""If it was a conversation just between the two of us you wanted we could have had it at my home.You didn't have to drag me down to some big government building.""This is not a government building.This is a private facility, and you don't need to worry about my colleagues; all that we need to concern ourselves with now is the events of last night.Can you do that for me?"The man talking to Terry had a professional level genuineness about him, but to Terry that meant that it was all fake, all just a show.The inquisitor still presented himself as such.No matter how sympathetic his eyes seemed, nor how welcoming and conversational his tone sounded, he still sat with his arms on the desk, with his fingers entwined among themselves, and with files and files resting underneath, perhaps all of them containing information about Terry even he'd forgotten.And in the dark corners behind the man, up near the ceiling?Camera's most likely, with god knows who looking and listening in from behind them."Fine," Terry said."I'll tell you everything.I know what I saw, so there's nothing you can say or do to convince me otherwise.""Just tell me what happened."&#x200B;

*It was raining that night.I'd come home from the hospital the day before, and my girlfriend wanted to cheer me up, so we left to eat out.She took me to my favourite restaurant, a small Italian place we go to on most date nights.We were even on familiar terms with the woman who runs it: Mrs Baranello.She and her husband used to manage the shop together until he passed, so now she and her eldest son do all the work: he cooks, like his father, and she handles the money as the cashier.She almost had a heart attack when she saw the state I was in.*

*The itch hadn't passed since the moment I regained consciousness.The doctors told me that this was natural and that it would pass if I did something to take my mind off of it.My girlfriend took this to heart, doing everything in her power to keep me focussed on everything but the irritation in my arm that was no longer there.No matter how distracted I seemed, or disinterested I looked, she kept on talking, struggling to keep the conversation alive at all costs.At no point did I feel that it was working, but at no point did I ever feel lonely, or like her attempts were futile.She didn't even try to cut up my food or help me eat; I would have rejected the help if she had, and she knew that.In between bouts of depression and hopelessness were moments of genuine amazement at how well she had adapted to all of this.Lesser people would have left me, but not her.Nonetheless, however, the itch was still there.*

*After a slow main course, I complained of dizziness and went to the bathroom to splash my face.As I got up, I felt the reality of having lost an arm start to weigh on me again, and I also felt myself actively trying to forget it.But at nearly every step there was something to remind me.On a pillar just past the main desk was a picture of Mr Baranello; it was crooked, so I tried to adjust it, with the wrong hand.In the toilet, there was a mirror above the sink which showed an obviously depressed man with his left jacket sleeve neatly tucked into his pocket, and in the basin itself, I tried to cup the water with both hands.*

*By now the dizziness had bloomed into a full-blown migraine.The itch never subsided; it kept me awake the previous night, and it was during this time that I decided every second I don't scratch it a piece of my sanity gets chipped away instead.That's when I saw something that convinced me otherwise.In the mirror, I saw a figure disappear behind the door, but the door never opened.For a moment I was speechless, and scared stiff, but not because I didn't know what it was, but because I did.My girlfriend was always a sceptic, but not me.And I don't mind telling you the name of it either: it was a ghost.I didn't notice it at the time, but the itch in my amputated arm had been quelled as if a tiny invisible fire under my skin had been doused.* 

*I left the bathroom and made no attempt to return to my table.Instead, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the figure walk through the open doors to the kitchen.I could tell it was the same one as before because there was a distinct fuzz around him that made him look unstable, and indeterminate, like a soul without a body trapped in a world it should have left a long time ago.My heart raced, and my migraine was forgotten, washed over by a swell of excitement like beach sands at high tide.* 

*I followed the wraith into the kitchen, eager to see the entity which single-handedly revealed worlds and planes of existence to me that I had only speculated were real.While I was fixated on it, the cooks were fixated on me; well, at least a few of them were.Most were too busy to even notice me slowly wander into their place of work.None of them asked me to leave, however, instead, they just watched me in disbelief.I can scarcely imagine what I must have looked like to them: a one-armed man with a face that was still wet, eyes that hadn't slept in twenty-four hours and a look about him that suggested he was having a bad trip.Was I a homeless person looking for food or just a lunatic who didn't know where he was?All that I knew was that if they were focussing on me, then they weren't looking at the ghost.*

*The faded, fuzzy spectre turned from what he was doing: running his finger along a dirty empty surface checking for dust.I recognised who it was immediately.His eyes looked at me the same way his picture did on the pillar.It was Mr Baranello, but what was he doing here?He gave me no time to consider it at all.After noticing me his face turned vengeful and filled with ghostly rage.He charged at me, and I reflexively swung at him with my dominant arm: my left.Mid-swing I remembered that that arm was gone but to my surprise, it still connected.Mr Baranello was knocked to the ground, but he shot back up straight away and came to grab me again.I was able to keep him at arm's length, although to me looked like some invisible force was holding him back.*

*The chefs definitely saw me now.Most had come to rally around me while others had run out of the room to ask for help.None of them approached me though; Mr Baranello had broken free of me, and both of us were now swinging at each other wildly.I did so with both arms, but I learned that only my amputated one could touch him.In the end, the fight spilt out into the restaurant.Patrons jumped from their seats and ran to the fringes of the room as the both of us crashed into tables and knocked plates to the ground.Mrs Baranello watched in horror as we fought, toppling ornaments and flower pots, but I'm glad she couldn't see what was really happening.I could barely believe it myself; that Mr Baranello, a benevolent man in life could be this enraged in death.Were all ghosts like this?*

In the middle of it all*, I was dragged from building by some of the workers.They kept me there until the police arrived but Mr Baranello did not follow me out.My girlfriend came too, looking as pale as, well... a ghost.She asked me - begged me - to tell her what was wrong.I told them about the spirit of Mr Baranello, about how angry he was and how unsatisfied he was with the restaurant.I screamed at the people inside to run away, and to those who joined me outside never to go back in again.Then there were sirens.I was hauled into the police car and driven away with the image of my girlfriend crying, and the image of Mr Baranello looking at me through the restaurant window burned into my mind.*

"Ok. How are you feeling today?""I am quite nervous.Although I suppose that is plain to see; I'm shaking as if the Arctic cold has gripped me.""Are you okay to carry on?We can always reschedule to a time when you are more comfortable.""No.No, there are things which must be said, and they might as well be said now.""Alright.In a few moments, we will be live.Don't worry, I'll count you into it.When we begin this light will turn red, and you will have to look directly into the camera..." 

"Oh... does it have to be a red light?""Yes.As I was saying, when the light comes on you will have to look into the camera.Look into it when I am talking, but especially when you are talking.Understand?""Y-yes.""Good.So..."

"Wait, now?Already?Alright, alright.It's time.5.4.3.2.1..."

On T.V screens all across America, as well as on phones, monitors and tablets in parts beyond, the figure of a broad, uncomfortable-looking man appeared, sitting in a cosy leather chair and trying desperately to maintain eye contact with the dark mechanical lens through which the whole world was now viewing him.He wore maroonish trousers, a dark-green patterned shirt, suspenders, and a long and thick white beard which obscured most of his upper torso.On his face - the parts of it you could see - were little round-rimmed glasses, and red blots mostly located at the tip of his nose and the topmost portions of his cheeks.The conversation began after only a second or two on screen."Good evening."the unseen interviewer said."Yes.Good evening my dear, how are you?"The broad man in the cosy chair answered in a way that felt bizarre to the viewers.There was endless kindness in his words, but in his eyes, there was... sadness.Dreadful, unexpressed sadness."Would you like to tell the folks at home who you are?"The interviewer asked.Although the viewers could not see it, most could tell that she had nodded to the large man in a way that suggested 'go on, just as we rehearsed' because the man himself almost nodded back.He then said, looking directly into the camera: 

"More than a thousand years ago I was captured while sailing in the north.Before my enslavement people called me Nicholas.But for centuries I have been known by another name: Santa.This is my story."
