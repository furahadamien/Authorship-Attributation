It was such a difficult task but they did it, and I'm somewhat proud.So many years of hard work and a whole family legacy led me to this day.At the top of the capital city of my capital country in my capital planet in my favorite galaxy, a place so dear to me even though I have been to countless places, I was watching my parade.Not in my homage, nor in my empire's homage, but a celebration for everyone.Today is, or was, a happy day, a celebration of our victory against, apparently, a much bigger army, a much more developed society.Today is the anniversery of our three galaxies union.And stll, unexpected things happen.I considered myself as a well prepared leader.Since I was a small a child they taught me about geography, astrology, physics, math, diplomacy, planetary cultures, the common language and many others.I aways liked to rule and to decide what is best in such a macro system.Some liked, some hated me, most didn't know about me, and there was comfort in that fact, safety against some of the dangers intrinsic to my position as leader.But paramont beings knew plenty and fully about me.They couldn't agree with my family's heritage, claiming Earthlings rules of such ancient age were nonsensical, that their species lived aeons without human interference in peace.Which is bullshit, as any serious galatic historian could prove.Unfortunately facts are not aways taken in consideration and lesser things like anger and frustation clouds our sight.Today should be a happy one, even my personal guards were in a great mood, allowing most beings that crossed my path to the speech booth to salute me and wish a happy day.Today should be a happy one and so I was, but today while I gave my speech simultaneously to all of the 231 billion planets across our legacy I had my head swiftly and delicately removed from my shoulders by an invisible blade.I don't know how, and I didn't want to die, but I'm somewhat proud.
