William had always liked children.One of the best miracle of Nature, difficult to describe.Wonderful.He came back from work, making a mental note to not forget to give the evening daily hug to his sweety at home, Helene.His daughter, 5, waited with a present, a mug.The mug was one of those having those cheerful but overused sentences "To my dad, you are the number 1".After the hug, the little one said to him "Daddy, this is for you!".He gave her another hug, a kiss and put the mug over the kitchen table, to use it directly the next morning.The next morning the mug showed another number."To my day, you are the number 583,745,382" .He questioned Helene, trying to be as careful as possible: "Did I do something wrong?All ok between us?".After a bit of talking in the family, with Helene denying any problem and receiving some more hugs and kisses, William left home for work.Shortly after arriving at work, checking briefly online communities, he got to know about the "mug problem".It seemed that "my father is #1" mugs around the world would report the ranking, among fathers, of the owner if the owner was a father.No one knew how the ranking worked, who decided them and how was possible that a mug could change its paint pattern.William, still skeptical, pondered the situation."Assuming that this mug ranking is somehow true.I'm behind the 583 millionth position.How many dads are out there?".An approximated computation showed that around 1.2 billion dads were out of there.So he was more or less in the middle of the rankings.He did not care to be the first of all fathers, or to be in the top 1000.He cared just to be not bad.He knew that providing a proper upbringing to a child is complicated and trying to follow arbitrary ideas of perfection would make thing worse.Nevertheless if this ranking was true, he was doing a mediocre job.Maybe not bad, but neither good, even though he put a lot of care, love and effort in the relationship with his daughter.Days passed.While still unexplained by science, the rankings on the mugs started to influence society.More and more stories by the media were done.Celebrations for the top 100 dads in the world were made monthly.Endless discussions were made about "why a father has such poor ranking" on the TV, news, social media and other channels.Also the police and the social services started to check the rankings to uncover possible child abuse or suspicious people that happened to have a family.Religions claimed the rankings be work of (this or that) God and started to point out certain behaviors as example of "high ranking fathers" and therefore "appreciated by God".In all this, William had the same ranking, more or less.He was living in a developed country, having an head start over hundreds of millions of other dads in terms of resources and possibilties, still his ranking was not as good as expected.To be in the middle of the expected population of "1st world dads" he should have been around the 150 millionth position.Therefore he was doing even worse than his possibilities allowed.With social pressure mounting, he started to question himself.Was he really so needed by his family?He started to say "I'm sorry" to his daughter.His wife slowly started to worry, but he denied any problem.One day he phoned home, saying that he was going to be late.In the empty office, he looked through the window.32nd floor, pretty high.Cars or pedestrian looked really tiny from that height.He could just transfer his savings to his wife and help to leave the family in a better situation.He was bringing them down, with his mediocrity.He couldn't figure out what was wrong with him.He was just trying to be lovely.Success for him was not a large bank account, he would be super happy to be able to give his daughter proper values to let her never feel inadequate in this world.That would be success.Improving the society of a tiny bit, through whatever way, that was his ideal of success.But the ranking on the mug seemed not to approve that.It seemed to say "you may have nice intent, but you are failing".If his wife would have found someone else, that men would likely have a better ranking of his.Tears started to flow, when he opened the window.Then his phone rang.His home.*sigh* William decided to pick up the call."Daddy!I cannot wait much more, soon I'll have to go to the bed.Where is my evening hug?""Sure honey, my bad.You will get two hugs tomorrow as compensation and one this evening.I...I was thinking and it took more time than expected, I'm coming, wait for me".On the way home he thought "how will my daughter accept that I left her behind?She will always ask why, why I left her.I cannot do this.I may be a failure, but I'll be there, whatever it cost."At home, he brought his daughter in bed.He read her a story.His daughter asked "Dad, have you cried?"."Yes honey, I was thinking about you, you are so wonderful, I'm lucky."and then, after a pause, "I'm so sorry."The next day William saw his daughter giving his mug back."Mommy helped me" said Helene.The mug was covered with labels, one could not read the number behind those anymore."To **my** dad, the only one that I have.My number 1".Super happy for the morning, William checked the news in the launch break, as a lot people argued online to be the best dad in the world, showing their mug as proof.
