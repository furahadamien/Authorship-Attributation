I still remember the test like it was yesterday, in the middle of a small and empty room there was this lone chair.It looked like one of those chairs you are when at the dentist, there's even a bright light attached to it.I was just told to sit down and relax, the test would be fully automatic and I didn't have to do anything.I don't remember the actual test though, it all went black the moment they put me in that chair.However I will never forget the look on her face when I came out again.She was definitly a scientist of sorts, dressed in a white medical coat, with brownish hair pulled back into a pony tail, and her eyes.Blue eyes filled with fear and shock.I couldn't do anything but to stare into those eyes.Then THEY came.Large brutish security guards told me to come with them, I would refuse but they "insisted".And for the last year I was locked inside an old prison placed in, god knows where.Atleast they treated us well, lucky I guess.I once asked why we were locked in here, what did getting a 100 rating actually mean.The guard just laughed at me and told me that I didn't need to know.But now I know why, after almost a year inside me and a few others managed to escape into the real world.The prison was really set in no where, but we got lucky and a car pulled up to us after only a short while.Now I really see it was good fortune we were allowed to have our ordinary clothes on even inside the prison, I guess they couldn't make things too bad for us as we had done nothing wrong.We separated and now I am back in New York, and damn have I missed the old apple.But quickly I realised the lucky 100 maybe wasn't that lucky anyway.After getting here I was looking for an appartment, when suddenly a young girl being thrown out on the street.I asked what happened and apparantly she hadn't been the best appartment guest, the landlord then just asked me if I wanted a place to stay.He couldn't leave the appartment unattended and she wasn't let in again.I couldn't say no to an appartment, even if I had no money or anything.The money problem wasn't really a problem, already after a few hours an ATM started spreading out cash after a disorder.It wasn't my cash but I needed some, just to pay my rent.I have noticed though, things such as this has happened all the time since I came out, random good things happening to me, but bad things happening to people around me.My neighbours have also realised that and are actively avoiding me.Is the 100 luck actually a curse, am I forced to "steal" the luck from others, because that's what it feels right now.The last few days things have gotten worse, last day a man fell infront of a car, I couldn't help but think it was due to me.The car would have hit a puddle of water if it wasn't for him, and that would definitly have soaked me.Atleast he didn't seem to be too injured.This is getting too much now, I can't leave my appartment without something "bad" happening, the moment I step outside there is someone injuring themself or losing something just so I can get a small improvement.I've had people who was walking slower than me on the sidewalk trip to the side so they didn't get in my way.I think however that the cops have started to notice me, there have been to many strange things going on around me.Someone just died.I was just in the store, going to shop...It,fell down on him.I...I never meant to harm him, I just asked if he could reach the top shelf.Then it collapsed, he fell and his head.His head

He hit his head and died, the thing I wanted just landed in my shopping cart.I understand now, I know why we are being locked in.I have tried to call the police, the line is always busy.I tried to go to the police station, a disaster happened and none would even speak to me.The prison must be a secret, I can't find it in any maps and I can't remember where it was, I just want to get back.I just want to be comfortable again, IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK!!!I don't know why I keep write this down, I thought I would find some comfort in reading this but I don't.It just reminds me of the bad things I've led to.This will be the last entry, people have died thanks to me.I can't let it happen again.It won't let me finish it
