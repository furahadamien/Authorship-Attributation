" You are my sunshine " 

Many moments pass, along with many sobs:

" my only sunshine," a voice chokes out."you make me happy "

A feeble hand is grasped tighter by a much stronger, yet more feeble, hand and a bloody tuft of black-stained-red hair is pushed out of bloodshot eyes."When skies are grey."You see many people, all above you; one in particular is crying and smiling through bloodshot eyes.This is surely your final goodbye."You'll never know, dear,"

It's painful to choke out the lyrics to this tired love-filled tune, but you want to comfort them one last time."how much I love you,"

Your eyes droop shut.Your life is nearly gone.You croak out one more time, horribly off key."so please don't take,"

Your life is suddenly cut out, but not what you see.Although what you see has changed, it is where you are.You see the body of your former self, her tarnished beauty marred by the vicious hands of war.Around her, you see a group of ten young marines.One stands out to you.He's the love of your life.He slumps next to you crying.Trying to comfort him, you gather yourself together and drift closer, but it's impossible to be there for him.You're but a bystander in a painful film.You start crying yourself, joining him in mourning.Several more moments pass, and he stops sobbing.He straightens up, through no fear of the gunshots and shrapnel zipping through the air, and he quavers out in a painful yet certain voice:

"My sunshine away."He draws you together, carrying you over one shoulder, and heads back to base.The base you two have so many memories at.The base that you two first met at.The base where he proposed.Where you accepted his proposal, where you two had rebellious se x in the janitorial closet on your patrol together.You know he'll never feel a love as deeply as he has with you.The other soldiers continue on ahead.Another casualty among millions.You suppose none of this matters.Suddenly, pulled to reality, you find yourself under a bridge.It's dark, stormy, and cold.You look down at your masculine grey hands to find a bong and a bag of "Dial y Ddraig".Dial y Ddraig is guaranteed to create the most memorable trip of your life.Even the little cartoon of an oblong green head with purple beady eyes is often seen saying "How was the trip!?"but you always respond rhetorically that it was as painful as ever.You slouch down, back further into the soil and a trn rushes by.It spews shit and mud all over you.The mud reminds you of the blood.It brings you back to the most painful time of your life.It was the war.You hated being drafted, you wanted nothing to do with it.You didn't care, you had school to think about!You were enraged that only men could be drafted.It was blatantly sexist.Yet, at boot camp, you find you are nearly the only man.You're surrounded by women.Not that you liked any of them.They're all mannish and boisterous.You're more soft and sensitive.Any friendship you try to form with your peers is held together with balsa wood and chewing gum.You're eventually set off to your first assignment, to defend a base near the enemy lines.Near the human civilisation.That's where you find the love of your life.She's beautiful.Dark black hair, streaked with red.Fair white skin.And she's strong.You two gather closer than you have ever to anyone else.Starting slow as friends, that all changed with a risqu encounter in a janitorial closet.From that day on, all six chambers of your alien heart beat for her.But it all was lost to nought.She was shot down in a skirmish against the humans.You and your squadron gather around her.All saddened, but none so much as you.You lose it and start crying.But she calls you down with a very familiar song.A song you both used to sing to each other while stargazing on long nights assigned to patrol together."Chi yw fy heulwen

fy unig haul

Rydych chi'n gwneud i mi yn hapus

pan fydd yr awyr yn llwyd

ni fyddwch byth yn gwybod yn annwyl

faint rwyf wrth fy modd chi

felly peidiwch  chymryd"

She is unable to finish the song.You gather yourself to finish it for her."Fy heulwen i ffwrdd"

You were never the same from that moment on.Your life was torn from you.You now spend your days getting high and reliving that time in every bad trip you have.Each of your veins had at this point collapsed.There's nothing left to you, and you finally realise the full repercussions of investing yourself in anyone.You've lost your sunshine.Your heulwen.Your only relief is to relive that life as the enemy had.As you had.The only commonality between the two sides of the war was the loss it brought them all.Edit: accidentally hit send before I was done.P.S.: this is my first time ever.Please excuse this story if it is poor.
