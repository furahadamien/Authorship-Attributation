It all started when I was walking to the store and as usual the queue was long, It was unusually quiet though.I went to get the usual things; milk, water and juice.Yes, this is my usual.Anyways, I went to line up in the queue as usual, and went ahead pulled up my phone and as I usually would just surf social media, you know; instagram, twitter, snapchat etc.Only this time, my phone wasn't working... "Great" I thought thinking my phone finally broke after 2 years of using it.It was an iPhone 6 mind you, with the recent discovery that Apple purposely let iPhone batteries only last till the next installment, I had no way of getting another so repairing came to mind, but that too was quite expensive.I'll deal with it later..So, frustrated, I looked up to see how many people are left in the queue....The guy in front is still there looking forward, in front of him is a women, seemed new to town, she was looking down at her son.Strangely, he seemed to be looking at me.The store manager was getting cash for the guy in front.The guy was wearing all black, plus a hood over his head, I couldn't see who he was.But nobody was moving.Why was nobody moving?What the heck happened?Wait a minute....**NOBODY WAS MOVING!!** OH MY FREAKING.WAIT.I quickly ran outside.Looked around.Cars....bikes....PEOPLE....EVEN THE CLOUDS WERE NOT MOVING.DO I HAVE POWERS?I still had the milk, water and the juice.I didn't pay...A smirk came on my face.No, I can't.Yes I'm *that* guy.I went back put a $5 dollar on the counter and ran.Yes.Yes I did just do that.It wasn't till I reached the door to my house, everything returned to normal.WHAT?THE SHIT MAN.I threw the milk, water and juice on the sofa, It was quite big, so it should've held them together.Ran back outside, and closed the door.Nothing happened...the clouds were still moving...cars...people WHAT?WHY?!NO.NO NO NO NO NO NO NO.Maybe I'm going mad.I knew eating those $2 fish & chips from that street vendor weren't healthy.Ah shit.I opened the door to go back inside, lo and behold the milk, water and juice had exploded onto the floor and the sofa.I can't do this right now.I...I...no.Not today.I closed the door.Banged my head onto the door.It's was all real, and you know it.No it wasn't go away.Huh, who was that.There wasn't anyone around me.What the...I'm truly going mad... No you're not you know what happened, they're coming for you.They know what you did.Me?What the heck did I do...Here I am standing at the porch of my house, talking to myself.Did I bang my head too hard?Maybe Neal was right.I mean he *is* a doctor.Who am I?A person going mad.Maybe I can save myself.I went to a nearby lake.Just laid on the grass.I just needed a nap.Maybe it was just a phase....I close my eyes.I wake up, my eyes open.I'm looking at the beautiful sky.I feel fresh....I don't hear myself again, so maybe it was just a phase... ha ha ha.This'll be a story to tell...I get up.No, ok, no.SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.PLEASE.FOR FLIP SAKE.Even the water.No, it's just a dream I gotta pinch myself.Simple....This isn't real, I keep pinching myself.I must be in some deep sleep.ALL I WANTED WAS A NAP, I shouted.A guy wearing all black.No wait.Hes *that* guy.The guy in the hood.He's right there!Hes doing this.He's making me go mad.I can't see his face.Has to be him.Never seen him before.He has to have done something.I run.Running, closer and closer.I'm almost there.I wake up, I open my eyes.I'm looking at the beautiful sky.Ha must've been some phase.Ha this'll be a story to tell...I get up.I look around.Two people jog past me.I need exercise, been thinking about it for some too.Next time...I start walking to my house.Hey!That women I saw earlier.It's her!She *is* new.Should I go talk to her, introduce myself.No, don't be an idiot, she has a kid.You're right, maybe next time.You know, I haven't talked to myself this much before.Is it a good thing.Did the phase start again?Be positive.It's probably a good thing.No it's not.I just told you don't be an idiot.Maybe I just need to clear my mind.Maybe exercising is due after all that's gone on today.I start jogging the direction the two people who jogged past me went.Im jogging.This aint that bad.Could get uses to this.Wonder what's the time.I went to pull up my phone from my pocket.Oh wait, it broke.Never mind.I stop jogging.Wait.What if my phone's fine now.I pull it up, what's my password?Did I have a password before?Is this even my phone?2-5-1-3-2.Nothing happened.2-5-1-3-2.Nothing happened.What?**2-5-1-3-2!!WORK DAMMIT!!** AH SHIT FORGET IT.YOU KNOW WHAT?!I look up.I throw it, far and high.Don't care.Problem solved.I just hear my heavy breathing.Exercise huh....cuz thats what you needed... Everyone says it's good for you.WELL EXPLAIN THAT!!*THAT* was your fault.WHAT.*you threw it*.CAN YOU JUST SHUT UP.I'm talking to myself.I need to see Neal.Get this fixed.Over and done with."You would think you have split-personality.I mean, by the things you've explained.One *would* go think, even go mad.Just like you've been going.But really, you're perfectly normal.Look, Steve, maybe you just need time off work.Just lay low, you know, just take some rest for a few days.You're probably just going through a phase.Here, someone wanted me to return your phone."My phone?I broke my phone?I thought."Thanks" I reply."Aren't you going to ask me how I got it?I found it in the lake...I don't know if I should I ask how it ended up there.But luckily the Apple store I went to offered a replacement.Though, they did say to allow everything to be transferred we have to send them your password.So just tell me and I'll ring and tell them using my office phone."Lake?Apple store?Didn't I throw it opposite the lakeside?There was no sound of it breaking dont you remember, I keep telling you to stop being an idiot.Huh?And what Apple store could he have gone to?The time between me throwing the phone and coming here, isn't the nearest store like 2 hours away?It only took me..what?15 maybe 20 even 30 minutes to get here?Oh come on...this is Neal you're talking about...*the doctor?* ...Fix up steve..

"Steve...?Steve???Hey steve?Earth to Steve!"Oh sorry...I was thinking about what to have for lunch today."Uh yeh thanks.I Just remembered something I gotta do for work."I'll call you later okay?"*Wow some cover...* Are you actually thinking Neal is doing this you idiot?*MY NAME IS STEVE!* "Steve are you okay?The password?I gotta call Apple remember?Security...uh replacement?"."Huh... ha ha why wouldn't I be?I just do that time to time...you know just to remember my name...Thanks for your help Neal.I'll see you later".I'm walking to the door.Haven't I seen that before?The hood.Neal?Wha-why-Neal?"Steve!Steveee!THE PHONE!"I hear Neal shouting my name in the back.There's no way...I..I gotta get out of here...There's a knock at the door.The door starts opening.I gotta get out of here... Neal is still calling me...I rush through the door... there were two people...I quickly rush through, I'm running down the hall.Today's exercise is going well then huh?.What?"Dad!".Dad?I glance book.The doors open, I see a kid through the window.Neal isn't married?Why do I care?He's that black hood guy.Can't be anything good.Wait a minute.I stop.I turn.The black hoodie.That woman.That kid.The store.Where it all started.They were there.He's looking at me.The same stare, in the store.I wake up, I open my eyes.I feel fresh.I breath the fresh air.A deep good sigh.So, it was a phase.Ha ha.This'll be a story to tell...
