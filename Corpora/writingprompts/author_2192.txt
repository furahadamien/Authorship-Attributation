George shrugged off sleep and stared blankly at his computer.He knew who was going to die, he knew what was going to happen, and he had planned the secret reveal of the true threat that loomed just north of Hogwart's walls.No matter how hard he tried, though, he just couldn't find the words.Maybe it was the success of his own TV series pulling him away, or his constant appearances at conventions across the nation, but George could not, for the life of him, finish this damned book.Mrs. Rowling had passed 4 years ago.4 years of angry fans, hate mail, and blank pages.The movie studios went ahead and finished the film, adding a subplot about Harry and Luna's intimate relationship."Damnit," Martin had thought, "It totally was my idea to have the dark haired hero get with the blonde...  Now I'll have to do something different in the book to appease the angry 'lit' fans.Lit fans were a subculture that arose around the Harry Potter novels.They refused to watch the films, preferring instead to wait in vain for the book.These fans were often obnoxious about their "pure way of enjoying the story" and their "ability to read".These fans hated the films and everything to do with them.They hated the subtle plot differences, the actors that "look nothing like the characters", and the more sensationalist feel of the film.Rowling had already killed off Hedwig before passing.She had George (Weasley) loose an ear and Dobby pass away (Martin had cleverly added a quick aside regarding dobby's name and the act of dobbing).That only left a few fan favorite characters to choose from, and George couldn't figure out who to kill.He looked down and started falling asleep again.He had eaten a large pot roast, with blackberry jam, nutmeg, and pecans sprinkled over it.The roast was a golden brown, and paired well with the merlot he had been gifted by a friend.The heat of the meal sat in his stomach and made his eyes heavy."Well," he thought, "maybe I'll get around to writing a few pages tomorrow."George fell asleep, slumped in front of his computer, knowing that he would never be able to finish a series.
