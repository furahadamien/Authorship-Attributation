Now this, this was a first.Two thousand, two hundred and fifty eight; in the negative.Negative two thousand, two hundred and fifty eight.It was hard not to stare.But with years of practiced motion you held the ID up level to their face as if to compare it with the small image on the lamented card, all the while looking above their head through your dark sunglasses.Never had you seen a negative.A few chance encounters in life had left you familiar with the ancients, so named for their staggering digits, and you figured well enough not to shake that tree.Best to treat this like normal then, whatever this was you are better off not getting involved.Just work off the ID and move him along.However...
"Sir, this is not legal ID.Moh-thar-rah,"
You pointedly struggled pronouncing the unfamiliar name featured prominently on the card,
"Isn't any place I've ever heard of.And maybe you can come back in a few millennia for your first birthday.September 2nd, 4275?This is honestly the worst forgery I have ever seen."The young, slender man looked back at you with an expression of puzzlement and growing distress; you'd seen this sort of thing before when kids got caught."Unless you've got real ID, take a hike kid."Handing back the card you saw the young man become somewhat flustered, looking at the card, then you, then off into space, before returning to you and leaning in with a quizzical expression."Revered ancestor, can you not see the numbers?"He asked in a hushed, flat tone.Surprise got the better of you then for a moment, behind your large sunglasses, which thankfully obscured your reaction.No one outside of your immediate family knew about the numbers, though to be honest they didn't really take it seriously."Did I go too far back...?"He continued to himself, ignoring you for a moment, lost in his internal pondering and semi audible mumbling, before facing you once more and pointing directly at the digits over his head."Negative two thousand, two hundred and fifty seven, right?Or something like that?""...fifty eight."You corrected.He smiled a conspiratorial smile at that, his eyes lighting up, his tone securing urgency and confidence."Jane Smith, we have much to talk about."He took a piercing step forward into your personal space, pressing a scrap of paper into your hand until you received it,
"Please call me when you can."Before disappearing into the night.You almost turned your head to watch him go, however...
"WHO WAS THAT HOT FUCKBOI, BOUNCER LADY??!I BET YOU GET ALL SORTSA ACTION BEEIN SO TALL AN BOOBIFIED AAND STUFF.ALL SORTSA NUMBURRS AND, BOYS, AND WOMEN MAYBE??EYE DON'T REALLY JUDGE WE'RE IN THE FUTURE MA-MAAM SO YOU CAN JUST HAVE AT IT I'M, I MEAN, I REEEAALLY NOT GOING TO JUDGE SO IT'S...YOURE BEAUTIFUL AND I-"
You look up at the glowing 34 above the next customer's head, then down at her best efforts to conceal her stupor.You'd sigh, or maybe roll your eyes if you weren't a professional."Ma'am, you're drunk, go home."
