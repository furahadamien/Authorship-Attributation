The familiar rustling of the Acacias lulled me from the dream.I looked down to hands that though so familiar, suddenly felt foreign - furry, rigid, and scabbed.Gone were the sleek and smooth tools that had made me everything I was.The veil of sleep rested heavy on my eyes as I looked from my perch onto the Savannah and everything coalesced in my mind.There were the sunburnt thickets of thirsty grass rising from the ruddy soil, but where were the streets and towns?A gaggle of impalas grazed to my left, but where were the other humans?My friends?My family?I latched my foot onto the branch and swung to the ground.Here, the smells of urine and passersby and the cool dirt below my bare feet brought me back to my reality.But how?The dream of that other life was so vivid.I had kids, a wife, a smooth and hairless body.I had a house made of steel and wires and concrete.I had books and a dog.I had a fridge where food rested until I was hungry.My stomach growled at the thought, and before I knew it, I was vomiting.In my mess was the remnants of the mushrooms I remember finding up over the hill.Panaeolus africanus - a species I had memorized in Med School.Aware of their psychoactive qualities, it all made sense, but how could I have lived a life in another world?I took a deep, remembering breath as the rest of my troop began to filter towards me through the grasses.They grunted and babbled their familiar calls, which now seemed so simple.Lubo the Younger was the last to join me beneath the tree, hobbling across the clay and dragging one leg behind.The troop was in an uproar over his fall from the tree and all knew he'd be unable to keep up with us.Lubo would soon be dead.I trundled up beside him and without really knowing why or how, I began to inspect the wound.The leg hung limp to his left, furry but taught with muscle.I could see the pain in his eyes, the fear.I gave him the most reassuring look I could muster and my mysterious training set in.I pulled grasses from the ground and broke straight sticks from the Acacia.I approached submissively and for whatever reason, despite the pain, he let me work.I lashed the grasses around his leg and the sticks to create a sturdy splint and then created a rudimentary crutch.I showed him how to use it and the rest of the troop thought I was playing.Soon, they were all trying to tie sticks together and jump around, but none could quite get the hang of it.Eventually, Lubo was able to move without putting any pressure on his leg.If he kept this up and I watched him closely, Lubo would recover.I felt the familiar feeling of accomplishment, like the day I got my white coat, but it all now seemed so distant, so pointless.That night, as we slept beneath the Savannah's blanket of stars, I crept from the tree and plodded up the hill to search for more magical mushrooms in hopes they would bring me back to my family, my friends, and that wonderful world I knew so briefly.
