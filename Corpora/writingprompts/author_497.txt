Suddenly there was a rush of heat..It ran from head to toe, drenching me in an 'awareness' I could not even fathom.Without thinking, I responded."Tell the 'workers of the grove' to align with the fifth and eleventh of 'the meadow'... Make sure the queen knows I'm safe, but that can wait until after you muster the troops...Hurry"!The bee took off, headed straight for the window it used to get in.That's just when Mom came around the corner.Without a word or second thought she smashed the bee to the ground and stomped it flat.She immediately ran over to me and asked if I was OK...I wasn't sure...I was still warm, but not hot.I was still tingling, but not as 'aware'.I could also hear my message repeating in my mind; on a constant loop.The loop started when Mom killed the bee..  


Before I could  muster an answer we both heard it... A low rumble from the western horizon.What/whoever it was, seemed both far away, and close at the same time.Sound wasn't working right.I could tell by the look on Mother's face that the sound was not only real... but familiar...


She turned and looked at me.She was cold.Her eyes froze me in place.I'm not sure if I was breathing or not (I'm pretty sure, 'not') frantic and frozen at the same time.. That's when she spoke."You need to tell me what you said, so I can fix this.I can explain everything later, time is of the essence!Please" ... That's when she said it and everything changed... "Please, 'Your Highness', I need you to trust me and I need you to tell me, right now.If it pleases 'Your Grace'... Then she stared at the ground at my feet.D'you know how, sometimes your brain can work at lightning speed and draw conclusions based on the information at hand and then gives you a 'gut instinct' to follow... Yeah...I think mines broken.All I could produce was a very, not regal, "mMoOOoommM, what's going on"?
