But seriously, I continued, why is there a naked man sitting in the corner?

Socrates scratched his chin and studied the man for an uncomfortably long time before replying: Wonder is the beginning of wisdom.

It was the closest thing hed gotten to a reasonable answer.At least it wasnt another question.Plato, who seemed to always be by his side, defended him.Its kind of his thing.He doesnt do straight answers.He wants to sound deep, but I can already tell you he hasnt got a clue.

Socrates snorted at Plato.Dont you think, as my protg, you should maybe show me a bit more respect?

Plato, clearly sick of hearing this, shot back as if on script.We both know I wouldnt still be here if it werent for you.

I mean, youve both been here thousands of years.Neither of you have even tried to figure out why that dude in the corner isnt wearing any clothes? They both shrugged.I think everyone who gets here asks the same question, Burt Reynolds interrupted, but nobody Ive asked even knows what language he speaks.

Hammurabi joined the group and nodded at me and Burt.New blood, eh?Let me guess, youre wondering about the naked guy?

We all waited to see if he was going to be the one who could add any insight.Hes one of very few people who has remained here longer than I have.And even I dont know who he is.

I grunted in frustration.Ugh, sitting in the corner, turned his head to look at us.
