"Just give me the f---ing wallet, man!"the mugger shouted.He wore a beat-up MSU hoodie and holey jeans."*Sparties*" I mumbled as I reached for my pocket, acquiescing the mugger's command.The sound I heard after that, though, I'll never forget as long as I live.It was a skittery sound.Skittery is the best way to put it.Like a branch against a window in the wind, but, like, *thousands* of branches against *thousands* of windows.Up the street the sound came.Along with it, a tune.I couldn't quite place it at that moment."Uh... the wallet, square!"Shouted mugsey.Ignoring the archaic insult, I felt strangely at peace with the tide of sound incroaching me and my quarry in this dank, filthy alley.The skittering grew louder, and with it the tune.I knew it by then.It was an old marching song; "When Jhonny comes marching home"."What in the ever loving is that?"I asked my assailant."F---ed if I know..." said the man plaid in green-and-white, "but I don't like it... *WHAT THE HELL?!?*"     
     
Just then, a black-and-brown tidal wave crashed around the corner of the alley!A sight you'd curse your mother for telling you she'd seen, but I swear it happened!All of them, in chorus: "The spiders go marching one by one!Hurah!Hurah!The spiders go marching one by one!Hurah!Hurah!"The press of arachnids came and covered my would be mugger.Encasing him, they turned him horizontal, then began to carry him out of the alley, his muffled screams escaping his lungs the whole time.As they went, the marching hymn still echoing through their fangs.At that moment, a little black one with two yellow stripes jumped up to me!"This is the end!"I thought, "It's my turn!"When she reached my ear, her tiny voice called out "Yesterday, us!Today, you, big man!Thank you for your kindness throughout the years!"And with that, she hopped off to join the press."Wait!"I shouted."Yes, spider friend?"The envoy replied."That song...Isn't it about ants?""*Ugh*" She replied."*Ant cultural appropriation*"
