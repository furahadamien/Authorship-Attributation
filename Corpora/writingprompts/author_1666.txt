This is, in good faith, liable to be my first and last dealing of any kind with Grandma Lil's cookbook, may the Lord rest her soul.The venture began as it should have, true.I amor wasconfident that I could follow the outlined steps, and to be completely honest, basic reading comprehension appears to be the only prerequisite for making chicken soup.Not even chicken noodle soup, mind you, but just "chicken soup.Ingredients were listed as follows: chicken, chicken broth, salt, one bay leaf, five whole black peppercorns, and a smattering of chopped vegetable matter (the individual naming of which is irrelevant to my woeful predicament).If I recall correctly, things went south following the addition of peppercorn.And I do mean, by south, that my soup had gone to Hell in a hand basket.Or perhaps Hell came to me.The devil's in the details and clearly, I did not read the fine print, even though there was clearly none!That is to say, I haven't the faintest scintilla of an idea as to where and why I went so horribly wrong.Nevertheless, here we are, me and you, surrounded by this gutted and smoldering wreck of an apartment kitchenette, which by the way, if you have yet to realize, comprises exactly one half of the entire residence.Horrendously trapped and wanting for space, I huddle in the kitchen corner doing everything I can to avoid making conversation.Or eye contact, for that matter.I wouldn't know what to do otherwise, so I am, at the very least, grateful that my unhappy coadjutor maintains our tenuous armistice, although seconds later I find cause to remedy the silence between us, only hoping that I do not speak out of term."Forgive my rudeness, but I do believe I have found the culpable element of our present ordeal."We survey the fractured tile flooring exposed beneath the four-burner stove, both cleft in twain by the force of the summoning.There is, in staggering relief, an intricate sigil, the calling card for a demon, painted there using what I can only assume is chicken blood, likely spanning the width previously filled by the gas range.Clearly, the former tenants have a lot of explaining to do."Well, that's... unfortunate," I remark plainly."Evidently, the precipitating events were unforeseen, indeed, quite so.Therefore, this may pose a bit more of an inconvenience for you, my friend."I try to smile, but I fear this gesture will serve the opposite of its intended effect."I don't suppose you have a way to get me back to Hell, hm?"
