Part I: Beginning

When I, Sir Simon G. Parsnickle CH KG FRS FRSA, was 3 months old, I contracted a persistent, unexplained bout of fever that gradually became worse overtime.I started losing weight drastically, my hair and nails started mysteriously falling out, and a sickly white pus began to leak out of ears none stop.My parents met with dozens of specialists from far and wide but none of them could provide a satisfying explanation for my mysterious illness or produce any sort of remedy.Then nearly five months later, when I was halfway past death's doorstep, the disease went away just abruptly as it came.I soon became just as hale and healthy as I had ever been, except in one key area; my close brush with death left me completely deaf.My dear parents, Tracy and Bob, tried their hardest effort to provide me with a nurturing and supportive environment where I could thrive in spite of my limitations.Other than my hearing loss, I developed normally in every other respect.I first learned to sign when I was eight and half months old; it was "I love you" (thumb, index, and pinky up; middle and ring finger down - kinda like the rock 'n' roll sign) because my mom used to do it to me nearly every waking minute of the day.They were fiercely protective of me, determined not to ever lose me again.Thinking back on it, perhaps they sheltered me a little too much.It never even occurred to me as a small child that that I was handicapped or different from other people in any way whatsoever.My parents both learned to sign fluently, I attended a school for deaf children, and I even lived in a special gated community reserved for the deaf and hard of hearing.Then when I was six years old, my family went on holiday to Ibiza.Before that I never really played with or even met any hearing children before and now at this beach resort, I was suddenly confronted a gaggle of them.I tried to sign to them but they all ignored me and ran past me as if I wasn't there.It was the most isolating experience of my life.But if being unnoticed and invisible was bad, being singled out as an aberration was far worse.After repeatedly failing to engage with other kids, I decided to go exploring on my own.I was sat on the sand at a corner of the beach playing with shells when this massive child of about ten hurtled towards me.He had red hair and a sunburned lobster-tinted face to match.He wore swimming trunks that were just a little too tight and had a belly that jiggled like non-Newtonian fluid when he moved quickly.He yelled something at me, made rude gestures at me that even I understood, and then kicked a load of sand into my face.I tried to stand up but he kept pushing me down and eventually I fell over and hit my head on a rock behind me.Hot tears streamed down my face and a sudden overwhelming feeling of sheer helplessness and unadulterated rage made my body writhe uncontrollably on the beach like a berserker worm.My beach bully's wide lazy gash of a mouth curled upwards but his cruel pleasure was soon overtaken by one of fear and concern as blood (and something else altogehter) started leaking out of the side of my head.My parents soon came to my rescue but not before the red fat boy had a chance to escape without a trace.It turns out I cut my head on the edge of the rock behind me and I had to go to the hospital and get stitches.That was the easy part, the doctors simply put me under anesthetics and did what they had to do.What was far more concerning was the white pus that was leaking out of ear.It was identical to the pus that I used to have as a baby, from before I went deaf.And it confounded the doctors of Ibiza just as much as the doctors of Jersey.After that my memory starts to get hazy.I remember feeling dizzy and disoriented, as if my head was going to explode.I must have then blacked out because the next thing I remember was waking up and a concerned nurse urgently saying something to me.She must not have been told that I was deaf, I thought to myself.Then I saw her nod and mutter something to herself and then suddenly bolt up in surprise.She turned towards me and tried to something to me again.I tried signing to her to explain that I can't hear but she kept on trying to talk me.She tried clapping her hands right beside my ears and banged on various surfaces, seemingly in the mistaken belief that if she just made a noise loud enough, I'd be able to hear her.She looked hysterical and she was starting to scare me.I really wished that she would stop and suddenly she did, with an apologetic look on her face while staring intently at my mouth.She then ran frantically out of the room, with a face filled with a combination of shock and disbelief.She soon returned with the doctor, my parents, and an interpreter, since the nurses and doctors mostly spoke Spanish and my parents only spoke English (and of course sign language).My parents told me to remain calm and explained that the doctor is going to be doing some tests on me to make sure that I'm OK.I nodded and signed to indicate that I understood but something still seemed off.The doctor spent the rest of the day blasting various sounds into my ears and gauging my reaction, which was none since I still couldn't hear anything, as well as examining my mouth and throat.Finally, they had me get an fMRI scan and EEG to measure my brain activity as they showed me various images.The next day, my parents explained that it appears that something utterly astonishing has just happened.Although I was still deaf, I have somehow gained to communicate with other people in their own languages telepathically.It was decided that in order for me to live a normal life, the hospital agreed to keep this a secret, especially since no one would believe them anyways.When we got home, we moved out of the deaf neighbourhood.They were always in favor of me having as many opportunities as possible and decided to use my new powers to pass me off as hearing.I learned to lip read and mouth words in order to cover up the fact that I can communicate telepathically.As I got older, I learned how to control my powers and to use it with greater precision.I learned to coat private thoughts with a layer of white noise so that people can only hear what I wanted them to hear.I developed an intense passion in languages which I turned to have a natural affinity at learning.One way I would learn new languages was to broadcast a thought to a native speaker of a given language and then study that person's response by lipreading.By the age of 16 I have learned how to lipread, speak, and think in French, German, Spanish, Mandarin, Farsi, Arabic Russian, and Punjabi using this method.
