God came down from heaven

He was looking for a soul to save 

He floated down so gracefully

In Georgia USA

He looked at mister Lucifer who clearly had been beat 

Then he turned to Johnny who was laying by a tree

God spoke up and his voice sounded deep and Stout

And said "who defeated Lucy?I demand some answers now" 

Johnny stood up grinning looking smug and proud 

And showed god his golden fiddle that he won in his bout

Johnny said "now lord I know gamblin is a sin

But selling this golden fiddle will feed me and my kin

Now I ain't got no money and food is running thin

So I took him up on his wager and went out on a limb"

Johnny shrugged and smiled and looked at his gleeming fiddle 

While little Lucy ate some popcorn sitting in the middle

He knew what God was thinking he prepared just in case 

He thought to himself Johnny fucked up beating him was a mistake 

God said "little Johnny it's time to face your judgement

You dabbled in the realms of hell now it's time for a punishment

So grab that golden fiddle and prepare yourself boy 

I'm going to show you how a god plays unlike a devil with a toy"

Down from the heavens a pure white fiddle fell from the sky 

The devil ate his popcorn and said "this gon be a crazy ride"

-
-Gods heavenly fiddle playing-
-

God released his fiddle and it flew back to the pearly gates 

Johnny stood up trembling his whole body had the shakes

God said "yes I know take your time it was majestic

Though I doubt you can comprehend it let alone best it"

Johnny began to laugh Satan though he went insane 

God's majestic playing must've messed up his damn brain

Johnny looked back up both his eyes were now pitch black 

he spoke in a demonic voice and said "that's where you lacked

By a god nor a devil I can never be defeated 

You both have crazy powers but I can never be deleted 

Having you two here is going all according to plan 

Who knew that God and Satan would end up in this jam

After I'm done with you two both your kingdoms will be mine

I see now that my path is clear while you two fools are blind"

Johnny's hand turned to bone, he didn't have a face 

A skull with in a black robe took over Johnny's place

Black smoke covered the whole area in darkness so deep

"Let me show you my style as I begin to jam and reap"

-
-Johnnys shreds the soul out of that fiddle-
-

God looked over at Satan "perhaps we need to team up

I wasn't expecting the reaper us together might not be enough

If we don't do this now both our world's are definitely done"

Satan looked at God and said "sure why not?Teaming up sounds like fun"

They both grab they're fiddles ready for the duel

A team never dreamt about.A devestating duo

-
-double trouble duo-
-
Both of them looked tired they gave it all they had

Johnny just stood smiling he wasn't even mad

He grabbed his fiddle one more time and didn't say a peep

He ran that bow across his fiddle with an ominous Creek

-
-final battle-
-

Johnny boy was victorious he sighed in his found powers 

He'd shape the world to his liking in in just several hours

"It took you seven days, I did in less than that

And you little Lucy, you spoiled jealous brat 

Your fued has caused me headaches for countless centuries

Reaping souls with no break man I'm freaking beat

I'll create a pure world, no hurt, no death, no sin 

none of us are needed were just 3 big has beens

now we can relax and forget about the past

And start a brand new journey, if not I'll kick your ass.-
-End
