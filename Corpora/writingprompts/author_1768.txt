The Lord went down to Georgia  
Cause he'd heard a great, loud fight  
Hell and men  
World at end  
He needed to make it right  



When he came upon a duo  
He looked down on the ground in the middle  
The Lord yelled "No!"As the Devil sneered "Ho!Look who found your fiddle".Now Johnny didn't know it  
But they were in a fued  
Heaven split and Hell froze over  
On Earth the lava spewed  


"Now give me that shiny gold fiddle, son  
This is bigger than you think  
There's Good and Evil  
In those strings  
They could end everything"  


The boy said, "Sorry, Lord  
For I know that I have sinned  
Satan tricked me  
Now the world's in need  
Please save us all again
