GrimMonolith
I knew it, I god damn knew it!That was the only thought racing through my mind at that moment.Everything else was quiet, unnaturally so.I mean, only a few minutes ago, Karen was in here with those old newspapers and my coffee.Those damn papers...I looked up at them, strewn across my mahogany desk.To think, I had just wanted them out of curiosity.Today was a rare day off for me, no clients and no research to do, so I had decided to read up on before I lost my memory.A car crash, that's what they told me.I didn't even need to look at the name, it all came back as soon as I saw that picture.As soon as I saw that mask I wore, I knew exactly who I was and what I had done.I'm even ashamed to say that the memories awakened something in me.Something that longed for those days.At first, I was angry, obviously.They were my memories.MINE!It didn't matter how bad they were, how much they hurt me, or what they had driven me to do.What are we if not a collection of memories after all?I picked up the picture of my family, my wife Alice, and the baby in her arms.I smiled as I looked over them.No, that's right.I have new memories now.Better memories.I have a loving and beautiful wife, and the being that she held was more perfect than any world I had tried to create.All the violence was gone from me now.I touched the picture of my wife's face, my smile only growing.And I couldn't help but laugh a bit as I watched the red tendrils devour the photo.There was soon nothing left of the photo, but ashes and my laughter.My loving wife and child.They would be first.
