She has always been there for me.She has always been honest with me.When I was 4 years old, she told me Mr Bunny had been saying mean things about me.I threw him in the bin.My mother was upset she said why did I throw away my favourite toy.I said he's not my favourite any more.When I was 6, she taught me what violence was.I drew a picture of violence in my class at school.The teacher was upset with me and told me I was wrong.Everything I've learned of life since then assures me I was right.When I was 13 she told me that Gary in my class wanted to kiss me.I walked over to him and kissed him first and it was warm and wet and weird.When I was 15 she told me not to tell anyone what uncle Paul likes me to do with the video camera.She said they wouldn't understand, and I was getting too old for it anyway.When I was 21 she was all I could see and all I could hear.I asked her for some time alone.I bought some flowers for myself but forgot to buy a vase to put them in.I rested them in a pint glass and didn't leave the house as I watched them slowly shrivel over the next week.When I was 25 she came back and I felt a shiver down my spine and I don't know if it was bad or good, but I didn't want to ask her to go away again.So she stayed.When I was 26 she told me that I needed to die so she could live.She told me what to do with the gun.My heart stopped for 30 seconds at the hospital.They told me I would be able to talk again with rehabilitative therapy, but that I would be disfigured for life.They told me she wasn't real.I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and given a lot of pills to take regularly.They brought me peace.I didn't see her again in a long time.When I was 37 I heard a familiar voice behind me, and felt a shiver down my spine."Turn around, did I find you?"Her speech was slurry and lisped the same way mine was after the incident.I turned around slowly.She hadn't aged a day the whole time I'd known her, but this time half her face was grotesque and scarred the same way mine was, except the opposite half.She touched me on the arm, and I knew she was real this time.I was hers again.
