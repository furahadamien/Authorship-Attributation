The roar from the megaphone was getting tiresome."Once again, if you come out peacefully, we can talk about this.But if you leave me with another dead body to take down to the morgue, I am gonna make your life a living hell, son."I really hated the way Lt. Parsons called anyone younger then 45 "son", like it wasn't weird or stupid.His condescension was what did it.While I'd long since had enough of his ranting, that paternalizing tone was something I just couldn't take anymore, so I put the knife up against my throat and cut deep.Despite all the duct tape holding the hilt to my right hand, I gripped my fingers tight around it anyway.I couldn't ever take a chance of losing it.**-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-***-*-*-*-*--*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

After the world went black, I awoke inside an brightly lit apartment building made of sturdier material than the one I'd left behind.I'd been told what the substance was dozens if not hundreds of time before, but I could never quite recall the name.I was on the floor of a bed room and could see the shape of a sleeping woman underneath the covers.I tentatively called out "Hello?"There was a stirring and I heard a woman's voice mutter something.Then I heard another woman respond with a muttered something.I saw a head pop up and there was a blonde woman holding a sheet over her breasts.The brunette closer to me turned her head and opened her eyes.The shrieked in shock, then squealed with delight.As they were babbling in that hard to understand dialect so common to the other world, my mind started to slowly acclimate to their bizarre manner of speaking."You === the jump person ===+= giver life".After a half hour of touch and go conversation, I was able to talk with them sensibly."So, can we take it from the top?"The blonde, who'd changed into a set of pantaloons and a man's shirt before handing me some fancy pajamas out of her closet nodded."Yes.We are honored to have you in our home Mr. Parrid.It's quite a shock to meet such a larger than life figure."The brunette chuckled "Save the honeyed words Becca.This guy's notorious for feeling awkward under too much praise.At least," she turned to me "that's if the interviews I've read are true?"I nodded."So, anyway, my understanding, is that when you show up here you check in with the feds and they take you to a place to relax, recuperate and plan your next rescue mission."Sipping my coffee I nodded."Yeah, so if you'll let me borrow a phone, I can make some calls and be on my way."As the brunette nodded the blonde interrupted "Hold up Layla, I gotta ask him some questions!""Becca, don't be rude, you can ask him stuff after he's made his calls."I shook my head."It's cool.I can answer a question or two before I make the calls.""I'll just give you one, the one I've been wondering for ages."I motioned for her to go on."So if stabbing someone with the knife sends them from one world to the other, why haven't you ever stabbed someone who came from the "older world" so they can go back and confirm what's going on?Seems like it'd make things easier."I sighed."I wish it worked that way, but it doesn't.I'm the only person the knife can send back to the older world.For any other person here... it's just a knife... at least so far as I know.It may or may not send them to another world from here, but it doesn't send them back to mine."Becca nodded."I'm guessing... you... know that from..."

"It was verified a couple of times.All volunteers, all sick with terminal or debilitating illnesses.After the 5th subject didn't end up in the older world, I made them stop the tests.I just...I couldn't stomach doing it again.It's hard enough to send people to do that to people back home, even knowing I'm sending them to a paradise" I saw a gloomy look cross Layla's face at the word paradise "doing it to someone who might just be fading away altogether... it's more than I can bear."*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

Layla walked me down the stairs while Becca went back to her bedroom to try to get some sleep.Apparently she had a work shift at a graveyard that she'd need to be well rested for.As we walked down the multiple flights of stairs (I was still leery of the moving box rooms that lift and descend through buildings) I inquired about her odd expression when I was talking earlier."Listen Mr. Parrid..."

"Please, call me Ronald.""Okay, Ronald...I know your "older" world is a hellish place to live, but it still feels weird hearing this world called a 'paradise', because it's really not.We've got wars, poverty, massive oppression, or governments are being co-opted by fascists all over the globe, and our massive industrial based system is destroying this place.Hell, our own scientists are talking about how we might only have another decade or so before the planet's climate is too fucked to fix anything.I've read so many of the horror stories of people that have come here, but it's...I'm worried that this society being so much less worse than the one they're fleeing is making it harder to get people to focus on improving this one."I nodded."I think I see your point.I mean, sure, it's not untrue that you and your missus would be thrown into a prison work shop for what you do behind closed doors, but that doesn't mean you're living on easy street out here.From what a fellow was telling me the last time I came back, it's only been a few years that your government's even given legal validity to your marriage.I was in a hotel awhile back watching some so called "man of god" ranting and raving about how the people coming from the older world are throwing things here out of balance, and how folks doing as they like, instead of as he wants are ruining society... it wasn't all that different from the hateful crap ministers of the questioning brigade shout about back home... but I have to believe, that people shown a better world than the one they've left behind will realize that they can keep improving that world, that having seen how much worse things can be, they won't settle for less when they know there can be more."She smiled and reached out her arms.I held mine out and gave her a hug.-*-*-*-*-*-*

Two months later I entered a warehouse and stabbed myself in the neck.When I awoke in the echo of the warehouse, there was a set of glass walls all around me.On the other side of that glass was Lt. Parsons holding his mini-musket."Stay where you are Parrid, or I'll shoot you clean through the head.Even if you cut yerself again, you won't bleed out quicker'n I can end your life in such a way that you might not ever trouble me again."Realizing there was no way out of this, I shrugged."Alright Parsons.Go ahead and take me into custody then.I give up.I won't even resist.""Would that it were such a simple thing.Not all that long ago, I'd have done just that... but now I can't.""Why's that?""Because Mr. Parrid, I've seen you materialize out of thin air with my own two eyes.That puts me over a line I didn't ever like thinking was really in the sand.All those years of reading your letters of statements from people you'd 'sent over' and confirming details.All those years of talking with that crazy alchemist about his various schemes to track you down and his talk of 'strange energy emissions'.All the rooms full of scientists arguing over the validity of the dozens of corpses you've left for me.All of those things, I could ignore while focusing on doing my duty and letting men far above my station sort things out once I'd brought you to justice.This?Seeing a man slowly appear as if from nothing?That's one step too far.That's me knowing that you're really on the up and up.That's me knowing that I've got to swallow my pride and my sense of duty and my honor and possibly the very state of my immortal soul.That's me having to put aside nearly every value I hold dear and beg you for a favor."I waited.It felt like pushing him to ask whatever he was going to ask would be the wrong move.So I stood there, looking into his eyes as he looked into mine.It felt like half of forever and not the good half."My son.He's always been sickly, but this past year or so, he was doing better.Then a couple weeks ago he started coughing and kept coughing.When his hankerchief ended up with bloodstains I feared the worst.When he came back from the doctor's office, those fears were made manifest.He's got consumption.There's nothing I can do to stop it, nothing the doctors can do... but maybe in that "younger world" you keep talking about... maybe they can do something."His eyes narrowed as he looked into mine."Will you help me Parrid?"The instant nod of 'yes' that I gave him, would end up changing to the course of history on two worlds.
