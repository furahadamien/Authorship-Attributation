The human species only has so many years left, then you are doomed to spend a billion years with other evolving animals on this planet.Then billions of years more alone as the sun swells and strips this world of its atmosphere.Your body that heals as fast as it is damaged will be ejected into space where you will spend a trillion years drifting alone until the collapse of the universe erases everything - even Heaven and Hell.You think you are clever to have cheated death?You think you are clever to have avoided me?You think others will want to share your fate if you offer them your secret?You will spend an eternity alone.Immortal IS Hell!
