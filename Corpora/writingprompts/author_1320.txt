Day 112 - Event 54


Over 100 days since I last saw her.Each day there's a brief moment, where I wonder if maybe it's finally over.Maybe I'm finally free.But I've been down this road before.I have to keep reminding myself that it's never going to be over.I'm always going to have to be there for her.Day 1 - Event 55


It happened again last night.It was her ex this time.Lucky bastard.If he knew my life he wouldnt be so angry about her leaving.I left this one on the street, bleeding out under a lamp post.He won't be bothering her again, so he won't be bothering me either.These are the best times.The times just after it happens.She's crying, she's scared, but she's with the police, or she's at the hospital, or she's just gone home to her parents.She's tired and hurt, but she's ***safe***.And i can sleep soundly.Day 25 - Event 55

Almost four weeks now.I'm beginning to worry again.Worry that it might happen.I'm cursed to always be there when she needs me, but that isn't some sort of black and white thing.I can feel it, all the time, pulling me towards her.Pulling me towards my own personal demon.Sometimes my stomach lurches and I know she's stumbled or had a fright, always something sudden that passes before the transition occurs.For those few moments, I can hear her voice, echoing in my head.A snippet of her life as the transition wavers on the edge of culmination.I live in fear of that moment, and I live prepared for it.If I wasn't, I could be pulled to my own demise.Not that it would matter.We've been down that road already.Day 1 - Event 56.Some crackhead got the wrong door today.She was sobbing in the corner of her front room.I threw him out of the window.He's lucky it was the tenth floor, he hit the ground too hard to feel much.From the date, it would appear I went 97 days without an event.I was dead for three weeks this time, before she pulled me back into existence.I posted the diary to my sister for safekeeping before taking a 23rd floor swan dive.Any less and there would be enough to identify my body.Sometimes it's nice just to get a break from the pull.In the dark void of nothingness that lies beyond life, you feel nothing, not even the passage of time.Now I can sleep again.Day 36 - Event 56

Sometimes I wonder what will happen when she dies.If I knew certain, I'd put a bullet in her myself.If that first mugger handn't shot me dead, I'd be willing to risk it now.But if Im only alive to be there for her, what happens if she's no longer there?Will I die immediately?Will I get a chance to live my life free of her?Or will I just be pulled to die by her side in whatever disaster befalls her.Day 1 - Freedom

It's finally over.She's dead, and it's finally over.I was sitting, reading a book, and I felt it, more suddenly than ever before.A Wednesday morning at 11:24am, in the middle of her work in a nice, safe office.No time to prepare, or think, I was just stood right behind her as she fell.Blood came out of her nose.My doctor told me she had an aneurysm.They told me I rushed to help her, panicked and scared.Once I saw she was lifeless, i was overcome with shock.I began crying and laughing, howling with glee.They had to pin me down and sedate me.When I came around, they told me I was overcome by grief, and I played along until I convinced them to release me.After 35 years, I'm free.No tugging, no fear.Today, Sharon Thomas, died, and I was born again.Day 156 - Event 57

My stomach has been growing tense over the past two days.I almost didn't recognise the feeling.Five minutes ago the pain peaked.And I heard it.A whisper."Its so lonely here.You said you'd always be there..."

They say we're lucky.They fear that luck, when that luck is so strong, so predetermined, that it's no longer luck.It's certainty.Sickness.Loss.Neglect.None of it matters to us.Some even question whether we can feel sorrow or despair.How would you test that?They tried, once, early on.They tried to cause us pain.Tried to cause us sadness.They simply couldn't believe we already felt it.They couldn't comprehend that what we want, and what is good for us, and what the world *wants* for us, aren't always consistent.I knew a man, once.He was lucky, like me.But that was the only similarity.He was a smart man.Well, we're all smart here, but he had a preference for the abstract.Philosophy.It drove him insane.How could he value anything, how could he gain any sense of self worth, when nothing was because of him?That sort of ennui is common in prisons, but for us?Constantly watching from inside our heads as they try in vain to extract what makes us so special, to replicate it, to stretch it to its breaking point.His breaking point was the sixty-second time they tried to kill him.At least, the sixty-second time we knew about.This was the first time we know of that they tried to play two 100s against each other.Trying to find a system so perfectly deadly, impossible to malfunction, that one or the other would *have* to die.That luck would have to make a choice.He was hanging there for 45 days, watching the bodies pile up.Anyone who attempted to approach the controls just... Died.Over and over, it didn't matter how high their score was.They couldn't match his 100.Eventually, they chose to send me in.A fellow prisoner.A fellow... Subject.They were truly grasping at straws.I stepped over the bodies, radiating outwards from the panel at the centre of the room.There he was, suspended in the centre of the room, looking totally composed.Practically meditative.As I reached the console, he opened his eyes and looked at me.In those eyes, I could see a sunken depth of exhaustion.A pool, infinitely deep, calm and still, but with a sense of foreboding and...Anticipation?"Finally."He sighed.It made me jump slightly.I didn't expect to be able to hear him through the glass.He smiled at me weakly."They sent one of us.Please.Do it."And now, luck played its final, beautiful card.Because as I raised my hand, and looked at the man I was trying to execute, it dawned on me.As I walked out, I thought about the room.I thought about the switch, against the wall, right next to the door into his chamber.I thought about the harsh, bright light, the cool white tiles, and the calm, quiet man perched in the centre of the room on a small stool.And I thought about the door, plain, simple, and unlocked.Sometimes, when I'm sat in my cell, wondering what experiment will face me next, abd begin to question why any of us are here, if our luck is so good.Then I smile to myself, and think about that man, still sat in his room.I guess luck does have a bigger plan for each of us afterall.
