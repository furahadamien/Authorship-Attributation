From the viewpoint he had he could barely see what was happening, but the surrounding sounds made up for his blocked sight, the rusty sound of crying combined with the soft sound of the priest reading from the gospel and the loudest of those,the silent sound of those around him, as though he could hear the people thoughts racing and crashing together like a trumpet player in front of percussions beating separate,but in a way together,their thoughts were all in the same key, death.One of the hardest things to understand is the concept of someone gone, the idea of that when a person dies, they're gone, their bodies, their dreams,their everything is gone for good.As he was talking with the deceaseds cousin after the funeral was over he heard a breath from behind,not a normal human breath but a breath that made his whole body feel like a stiff peice of wood, and with the small courage that the breath sound left him with he looked behind him,as slow as a human being could possibly turn, to find nothing but empty graves."Are you alright Seth?"Gordon said."Yea...yea anyway I need to get going, my asshole boss already called me like a hundred times,again if you need anything call me I would be more than glad to help".The shouts from the protest were really loud this time and the amount of people participating was astonishingly increasing, Seth made a note to himself to never work next to a corrupt ministry in a country like this.And as usual the protesters were blocking the parking spots of the company so Seth had to park  ten blocks away.Trying to walk through the crowd to his company, he wondered how the fuck does he not get a vacation from the company with the current situations of the work place, but again as usual he just continued on walking.It felt like hours trying to get to the building of the company,but finally he saw the entrance,which looked somewhat different,as though something changed or perhaps..."Guns!!"The shouting came from behind 
"HE has a gone!!EVERYONE DOWN !!"And as Seth was turning around he saw something that saying it's terrifying won't do it fair, its size was huge for it to be a human, its white hair dangling long on the naked black and red skin, and the eyes a purple so shallow it almost took his attention away from the bullet and blood coming out of his back,but it didn't hurt!It felt like nothing, as though he lost the ability to feel pain, as though his only feelings were the fear of the creature approaching, seconds felt like days while the creature got closer, he saw his whole life in those pools of purple stained water.But then it happened the red and black creature opened his mouth, only to reveal rusty black teeth, and then the pain that Seth never felt before, never even imagined is possible hit him while he saw something blue come out of his chest, and while the creature chewed on it with those black spears in his mouth,Seth screamed so loudly that no one seemed to hear.And only then did Seth realize, there is no more stronger torture,thab facing death itself...................................................................................
