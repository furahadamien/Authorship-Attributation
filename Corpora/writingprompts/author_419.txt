There was once a kind giant, who lived outside a village of little men.The giant loved to be with the villagers, happy to help them and in return enjoy their company.The men and the giant traded and lived in harmony, until one day the giant crushed a villager by mistake.He tried to apologize but they shot him with their little bows, and he screamed, thrashing and trying to protect himself from the pain.Finally, when he looked out he saw the village in ruins, and he was horrified.The mayor of the village asked him to go to a cave far away to keep himself and the villagers safe.The villagers promised to be rid of their weapons and to welcome him back when he awoke once more.So alone and in the dark the giant slept, ignorant to the world.Finally, the sleeping giant awoke, and walked to where the village once was but instead there was only ruins.He called out all the villagers names looking for his friends, but he was answered only with silence.The giant fell to his knees in the center of the village, angry with the world and he wept for he was alone, forever.*I wanted to try something a little different for the prompt, please let me know what you think.*
