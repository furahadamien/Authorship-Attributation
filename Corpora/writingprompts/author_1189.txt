Thanks reddit, I said, Yall make this community spectacular.Ive been coming here for a few years just to have fun reading and writing, and apart from getting banned once when a mod thought my story was so terrible that I must be trolling, the feedback has always been constructive.I think that says a lot about an internet community.The rest of the internet can get pretty negative and rude, but the people who hang out onare really awesome to each other.And I really mean it when I say-

Something tapped my shoulder from behind.I swiveled my chair and saw Revolutionary Comrade Zootthe protagonist of the very first story I posted tothree and a half years ago.Remember me? Zoot asked.I, uh, I sputtered.I racked my brains trying to remember his name and his plot arc.You forgot? Zoot said, shocked.Youre blue, I said desperately, Um, youre like a a communist type alien, um,

Zoot frowned.I was part of the prompt: [WP] You are the heir to the family business of being a superhero.At 16, your power is unveiled, but no one expected what it was 

I nodded, the memories beginning to stir.You gave me the superpower of superdreaming, Zoot said."That's right," I said."I always wanted to ask you something," Zoot said."What's that?""What's your dream?"Zoot asked."Me?"I said, "It's pretty simple.I just want people to read the stuff I write.""So you've made it, then," Zoot said, "Just like me.""Yeah," I said, "I suppose I have.All because of reddit.""Thanks reddit," Zoot said, turning to face YOU, the reader."You're awesome."ze end!---
