"Quit now Dan!"said the man on the talking billboard.A finger pointing at the lone figure walking down the empty street.Empty due to everyone crossing to the other side to avoid him and his smog.Dan paused by a waste bin, small cardboard box in hand.He looked from the box to the bin and back again.Those across the street stopped and stared, ready to witness history being made.There was absolute silence as Dan lifted his hand, as if to throw the packet towards the bin, all eyes now on him, even the billboard advert man stopped to watch.He launched it.It hit the rim.There was a sharp intake of breath as it bounced into the air above the bin.It hit the rim on the other side, people held each other in nervous anticipation.The packet landed onto the other trash in the bin and the crowd across the street erupted into thunderous applause and cheering.Celebrating as if a great sporting victory had been achieved.Little did they realise that Dan had taken a new packet from his pocket, removed the plastic, drew a long white stick out with his teeth and ignited the end.As a large grey cloud left his lips, the crowd died down.realising their premature celebration.There was a disappointed groan and a shuffling as daily activities resumed."God dammit Dan.You were so close."shouted the billboard.
