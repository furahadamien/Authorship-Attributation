The weekend -no, month- has been horrible.I had a falling out with my only sibling.My mother decided not to spend Christmas with my family because we asked to have it on Christmas Eve rather than Christmas day.My husband's estranged mother showed obvious favoritism toward our 2 nieces by getting them Hatchimals and candy while our 2 sons got $50 to split.Son 1 has been getting an attitude and son 2 has been sick but can't go to the doctor because of the holidays.Stress has been eating away at me to the point where I've been sick.Finally relaxing and I decided to scroll through Reddit in hopes of finding a funny TIFU or Pettyrevenge.As I scroll, I come upon a Writing Prompt."You are yourself, on Christmas day, reading this on reddit, you are told that you are loved and accepted for who you are, and to have a happy holiday season, and a great New year."I exhale a sigh of relief, snuggle my sleeping sons a little tighter, and whisper, "thank you.I really needed that."
