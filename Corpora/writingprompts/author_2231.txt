**0 Days since Discovering Life in the SL-2 System**

Hey, Somaat, come look at this.Am I reading this right? Korjal said with prudent curiosity.My readout is telling me SL-2 is emitting weird elevated amounts of radio waves. Somaat got up from his station and meandered to her side.Probably, or maybe the calibrations off.Where is it again? Somaat grumbled.SL-2 is in the Orion Arm.

 Are the arrays in sync?

Yes.

Are you looking with correct optics?

Yes.

Sensors?

Yes, Sir.

Hmm... Somaat growled.No worries, well get a diagnostics team to look at the software.But in the meantime, I suggest *you* notify the Congress on your findings. Korjal flinched in her seat, Sir?Is that wise?We dont know if- If it is, you may have found *the* first civilization.If not, it was a fluke with the equipment, nothing more.Either way, we will have our answer tomorrow.

**10 Days since Discovering Life in the SL-2 System**

*After Korjals findings were presented to the Stellatic Congress, a task force was quickly established and mobilized to reach the SL-2 system, and if its inhabitants still extant, to perform First Contact on behalf of the Living Worlds Confederacy.Being the entirety of the Cofederacy resides in the Scutum-Crux, and again assuming SL-2 harbors life still, SL-2 would remain largely autonomous until Portal Apparatuses can be emplaced.Being the two who first observed SL-2 readings, colloquially known as the Old Ones, they were given special permission to be on the task force.*

Korjal stood by Somaats side.And how long did you say the voyage will take, Sir? Somaat inquired the Commander.If we leave on schedule, and there are no major inconviences, we should reach the system within 20 days. Korjal was no warfighter, she was an astronomer.Please, Commander, this is a scientific mission.Why are we embarking on a navy cruiser? The Commander smiled, Thats an excellent point Korjalmis.We are simply acting as a security force.In fact, we have stripped most of our munitions and arms to make room for the equipment and any artifacts you may find! Korjal smiled, and the three went on their way.In three days time, they would embark on a journey that would challenge everything they knew.**25 Days since Discovering Life in the SL-2 System**

*The expidition went off without a hitch.All personnel accounted, and all equipment in inventory.Over the 20 day voyage the instruments were flooded with new signals and data was ever increasing.What no one expected however, was how quickly the signals changed.It was as if whatever species lived at SL-2 was extremely adept at honing and perfecting the technology they had, and inventing new tech.The scientists and researchers on board were so overwealmed, the Commander altered course to a nearby star system approx.1.5 parsec from SL-2.The Commander, with imput from the the research team, held steady for an additional 2 days while the data was being analyzed.**

Somaat buzzed Korjals bunk door, there was an urgency to his ringing.Hey, Korjal, open up!Todays the day! He called in his gruff rumple of a voice.Were finally going to see SL-2!With our own eyes! The bunk door slid open, and a groggy, yet exited, Korjal slunk out, Awesome!What has the data collected show? We dont know!Its nothing like what weve ever seen. Korjal perked up, what does that mean? Somaat sighed, There was definitely a civilization here at one point, but looking through radar and telescope, we cant see anything- nothing.And yet the signals are strongest and most advanced theyve ever been. Just then the intercoms blunted to life.All non essential naval crew and research personnel are now permitted to make way to the observation decks Also and Calso.Special clearance for Somaatsos and Korjalmis to board the bridge.

*As the two made there way to the bridge, the crew was emanating excitement.It was one thing if an intelligent race rose from the soil or sea in the Scrutum-Crux, the worlds were close, and most rose around the same time.But SL-2... this was different.All data shows the species here life millions- if not billions- of years.These were the first.Who knows if theres anything left, or if there are just mighty ruins of the mighty race that erected them.*

Welcome to the bridge. The Commander beamed.Thank you for inviting us, Sir, Korjal spoke, trying to curb her excitement.This is it, the moment of truth.Its been a pleasure and honor for myself and my crew to be chose for this momentous occasion, the Commander continued.They will speak of us, especially if you, until the end of time! Somaat turned to his partner, So, what will you call them? She looked at him with confusion.You were the one to find the signal, and to present the idea to Congress.You should name them.Personally I would call them the Precursors. She smiled, Yes, I like Precursors. Just then an alarm went off.Sir, sensors are showing multiple objects closing in on our coordinates, the Bosun snipped.Sir, we have an incoming transmission from an unknown source. Another officer added.Go to Yellow Alert. 

Just then, 10 ships of unknown origin decloaked.>!This is the ENS *Serenity*.Unknown Vessel, you are entering Earthen Space.Halt course or you will be destroyed.!< Technitian, what are they saying? The Commander barked.Unknown Sir!We are cross referencing the reansmission to the datalogs.

Commander, could these be the Precursors? Korjal inquired, unsure of what she was expecting the answer to be.A massive ship, even beyond the size of the largest Conferacy ship dropped out of subspace.>!This is the ENS *Serenity*.Unknown Vessel, this is your final warning.Do not enter the Oort Cloud, or you will be eliminated.!<

Lieutenant, open up a hailing frequency and order all engines to stop.

Affirmative, Commander.

Somaat and Korjal were both amazed, and frightened.When they studied astronomy, this was not what they signed up for.
