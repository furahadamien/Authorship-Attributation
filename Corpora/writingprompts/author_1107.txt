We saw the Soviet flag from outside the capsule.All of us got concerned.Did they beat us here and not tell us?I radio back to Earth about the discovery.As we wait for a response, all of us just anxiously wait.We start coming up with theories on how this could be.Buzz says, "Maybe its coincidence."Jenny screams with tears out of her eyes, "I just better be the first woman on this red planet!"Allen proposes, "I know I will be the first female to male on this planet either way, so I don't care."Finally Houston gets back to us.["Turns out the Soviets forgot to tell us that when they beat us to Mars in the 1970s, their little rover had brought the Soviet flag along with the their coat of arms."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_program)

We all breathed a sigh of relief.I turned to the window again, ready to press the open latch and thats when I saw it.What looked to be a humanoid figure was wearing the Soviet coat of arms that also came with the rover
