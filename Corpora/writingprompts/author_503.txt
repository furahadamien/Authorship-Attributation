*Wake up.Wake* UP*!* This couldnt be actually *happening*, right?There was no way that bee had just spoken to me.And how come I hadnt freaked out yet and ran from the room?Normally I cringe and yelp involuntarily when a bee even gets *near* me, let alone lands on my shoulder!Though my mind could barely comprehend what was happening, my body felt relaxed with the Reaper on my shoulder as if caught in an old friends embrace.This seemed too vivid to be a dream.I pinched myself.It hurt, and that bees stinger could hurt a hell of a lot more.I reached for the phone in my pocket.If I was in a dream, then Id probably have a difficult time typing, as if my thumbs were twice their size, and the keyboard kept rearranging the letters.The bee didnt seem too perturbed by the movement of my shoulder, maintaining its perch.With ease, I began to type a message to my mother, Help me.Theres a bee on m 

There came a squeak from the bee, like the noise a dog toy makes when you squeeze it, but without the proceeding sound of the toy refilling with air.I got the impression the bee was clearing its throat.Your Majesty? the bee said, more urgency in its voice this time.I dont mean to rush you, but it took a long time to get to you, and *many* bees sacrificed themselves.We honour them all as heroes to the cause, but Id rather not be another, so we should probably get out of here.

B-bee! I stammered, my mind slowly trying to accept what my body already seemed to know  that this was *not* a dream.The bees eyes shifted shape slightly, somehow portraying a very human expression of annoyance.Yes, Your Majesty, Im a bee.But I have a *name*.Its Clay.

Seriously? A bee named Clay?I dont know what I expected a bees name to be, but I definitely hadnt imagined it would be shared with a second season American Idol runner-up.Clay sighed, like a balloon letting out just the tiniest wisp of air.Yes.What did you think it was?Bzzzzzzzz? *Kind of*.We need to GO, Your Majesty!All of our queens are eagerly awaiting your return.Come on! And with that, Clay flew back into the vent hed come out of.So much for my orders. 

I took a deep breath, then exhaled slowly.These past fifteen seconds had been, by far, the strangest in my life.My long-held assumptions were starting to fall apart.My mothers efforts to keep bees away from me, as well as those of all my caretakers, tutors, and bodyguards, hadnt been about protecting me from a deadly allergy; it was something much more mysterious, maybe something *nefarious*.I had to see where this went.I stepped under the vent, went up on the tips of my toes and craned my neck so my mouth was almost level with the vent, and called I guess Ill meet you in the front yard, then.
