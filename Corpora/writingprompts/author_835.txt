Jace opened the antique mason jar and gently set the glass container on the grass, tipping it methodically on its side as the jet black spider scampered out of its cage and down the beaten path."Today you, tomorrow me."He whispered.He had always been the tender hearted one.Soft wouldn't be the word for it, for he was strong and well built, but knew in his soul that all life was precious.His twin brother Sevlin had been his polar opposite; burning, crushing and poisoning at every chance.Jace felt as if he were bringing the world slightly back into balance every time he saved a life and he had saved more of the 8 legged creatures than he could remember.Jace looked at his watch, half past noon.He had spent too much time clearing the house and at this rate he would be late."Shittt" he groaned as he tore off through the trees, it was 5 miles to the training grounds and his father would be angry.Tightening the strap to the rifle slung across his back he wove his way through the path his father had cleared so many years ago.How many times had he done this now?Since his sixth birthday he had been coming to this place with his father and brother, honing his skills, training to become a.. a killer.But today there would be no training.Today was the Division.Beep beep, beep beep.Fenton silenced the alarm on his watch and then looked to Jace who had just slid into the clearing  "you barely made it son.""Sorry father...I was... cleaning the rifle one last time" Jace lied trying to catch his breath."Sure you were softie" his brother Sevlin sneered.Jace had cleaned it several hours before, but the truth would have only given his brother a reason to really lay into him."That's enough Sevlin" his father commanded.Fenton was a domineering man, cold steel being the only way to accurately describe him.Tempered and hard, unmovable in his beliefs.He truly was a man made for this world, or maybe that was just what the world had made him."You both know what today is" Fenton said, his jaw stiff, eyes stern."Today one of you lives and one of you dies."Jace grimaced.The Division was a way of life.Like his father and his fathers father and all generations before, all male children were born twins, their identical counterparts being their greatest obstacle on the path to becoming a man.It was also the day Jace had grown up dreading the most."Father, please" Jace pleaded, keeping his voice low, hoping his twin hadn't heard."You're not getting out of this brother" Sevlin sneered, a wild look in his eyes."Today you die.""You know this is our law Jace" Fenton said, "this is the way it has to be.""But WHY?!WHY?!You never tell me anything, WHY does it have to be this way?""That's enough, now get ready" Fenton commanded.They had practiced this a thousand times, methodically both boys drew their rifles, checked their magazines and drew back the charging handle, the solid click of the bolt slamming a bullet into the chamber confirming both weapons were ready to kill.They would enter the woods at different ends of the clearing and slowly work their way to engage each other and the inevitable result that awaited.Jace closed his eyes, trying to muster the courage to do what must be done.Palms sweaty, he tightened his grip on the rifle and began moving through the trees.Any other day of his life, this is where he felt most at home.He would often spend the night in these woods, listening, learning, wondering if any of the creatures he had saved might be out here living, thriving.Crack, BOOM.The tree next to Jace's head exploded, his brothers maniacal laugh echoing through the forest.Jace turned and began running."I can't do this he thought, I can't do this, it's not right, no matter what happens he's my brother!"Deeper and deeper into the forest he ran, his brother's gun barking behind him.The forest was darkening now, this was a part Jace had never been to before, it was as if the trees were swallowing the light around him, and still Sevlin followed.He was close now, too close."I'm coming BROTHER!"He yelled.This is it Jace thought turning and beginning to take aim, its now or...What?!Wha.. what's going on?Jace dropped his rifle, stunned.Before him was the most beautiful sight he had ever seen.White thread, as far as his eyes could see, beautifully woven in the most intricate patterns.Light gleaned from every strand reflecting the majesty of this creation, and in the middle of it all... was Sevlin, bound up to his neck and struggling to loosen his bindings."My God" Jace said "that isn't thread, it's a... a web".And then he saw it, an army of jet black spiders, they were EVERYWHERE, and they were perfectly still.Still except for one.One lone spider was moving, crawling in his direction.A shudder went though him, what was going on, am I going to... to die?!Slowly the creature crawled to him, it crawled up his leg, under his shirt and up to rest on his neck.Not daring to move, not daring to breathe Jace waited, his mind racing."Today you, tomorrow me" it seemed to whisper as two razor sharp fangs thrust into his neck... and the world went black.Slowly, Jace opened his eyes."Where, where am I?What happened?""Well done my son, you survived."Said his father's voice as Jace tried to rise "Easy, take it slow" he commanded."Father?"Jace groggily muttered regaining his senses, "What is going on father?TELL ME!"His father looked at him for a long moment then stood and began walking deeper into the forest."Follow me Jace, we have a lot to discuss.And bring that rifle."
