My mind has always played jokes on me, but this is too much.I've long been in the habit of finding reasonable explanations for the way the world coincides with my inner life.But this defies explanation.I rifle through the envelope.There's a thousand dollars in twenties.My name is scrawled in childish letters on the front."So this is what the space inside my mind is worth.One of those things you think is priceless, but nothing is.A thousand isn't too bad though."I look around my messy office, quiet but for the creak of floorboards in the apartment overhead.Dust motes dance in rays of sunlight that land across my oak flat top desk.One of the few things from my parents' house I wanted to keep."How'd you get it in here, then?"Nothing.He comes and goes - a ramblin' man.Sometimes I imagine there's a railway network between the brains of the world, and I've got a stop near a hobo camp where the crazies like to hop off.A thousand bucks.I could get into trouble with a thousand bucks.I slap the envelope across my palm a couple of times, almost heading for the door.I pull out five twenties, shove them in my front pocket, and throw the envelope in the safe in my closet.Someone is banging on the door.My heart picks up a bit.Through the peephole I see the fisheye distortion of the neighbor kid Lucy.I open the door."What's up, kiddo?""Who's the guy who was here earlier?Why does he have a key to your apartment?"I knew it.I knew I wasn't crazy this time.It's hard to understand if you aren't crazy yourself, but an explanation that makes sense is better than no explanation - even if it means someone broke into your house, apparently with no other purpose than to leave you a thousand dollars.Which has no other explanation other than a thought you had earlier.The real explanation is there, somewhere.You can find it later.But this is a good start."He's, uh, my uncle.He was just feeding my fish for me.""You don't have a fish.""I got one."Lucy scowls at me.She knows I'm almost always full of shit, so she almost always regards me with the same chronic skepticism usually reserved for known liars and problem children."Well whatever you're getting into, stay safe, okay?"She whirls around, her long, straight black hair making a disc around her head for a moment before she runs down the hall.I head out the front of my building, texting as I go.I let my guy know I need to meet him.He's always happy to grab coffee any time of the day or night.We slip into a booth at Jack's Old Fashion'd Diner.In my head, to me, it's "Jack's Unnecessary Apostrophe Diner."Private jokes are a little more fun when the voices in your head chuckle with you, but not by much.My guy has messy brown hair and snake green eyes.His white t-shirt is loose and semi-wrinkled like he slept in it.He probably did."So you come into some money, or what?What's with the house call?"I never correct his haphazard speech.It seems like his mind is always catching up to where and when his body is."Something like that."I say.He smirks."So you sure you only want that amount?I can provide a longer supply..."

"I'm good with what I asked for.What, you tired of seeing me or somethin'?"He takes a quick look around the restaurant, moves his hand near his coffee cup on a saucer, then slides it towards me.I pick it up, pour in some creamer, then push it back to him.He smiles and puts his hand in his pocket."You're getting better."he grins.Gulping the rest of the coffee, he slides out of the booth."And you're finally learning just the right amount of cream.It's a finesse game, you know.An art."I raise my eyebrows in a kind of "yeah, uh-huh" gesture.But he's already gone.Look, it's nothing crazy, okay?Self-medication kind of becomes necessary when you're in my position.Insurance doesn't cover the anti-psychotics my doctor wants me on.These are pretty close and they're half the price.I cut through the park on the way back to my place, crunching the pills and thinking about the man in my apartment.At times my life has become a blur of my mental projections and my reality, people coming and going, people I half-know and some, who after spending nights and days with, seem like the most real thing I know, turn out in the morning to only have been a fever dream, barely remembered.Ho boy.They're kicking in know.The grass in the park turns blurry, green blur, and things smooth out.The sky is a crystal.I can see past the atmosphere.Green is good.That's it.I'll try to remember.Revelations, revelations!They come.The time comes, and I feel it, and I know it, but to remember, ah.That is the thing.The thing which I grasp, yet not fully, yet oh the sky.Madness.Cooly I walk, cooly.No time for a rest, a spell.Who now is this dark figure, this devil beside me?I sit.A half-stand.Beside me on the bench.Who?*Are you okay there, friend?*

He speaks from underwater - a merman.A sea creature.from the night of the world.*You're swimming in a narcotic sea, aren't you, pal?*

"My mind reaches... and takes.And beholds."*But you see me, don't you?*

A sharp change.a turn in the wind.felt but not seen.The man - the sea creature.i behold him now.no, not a stranger.a known person.a quantity.a memory.a voice.*I trust you found my first month's.*

a shiver.a remembrance.money in a narrow paper box, a gift, a strange thing in a strange place.rent."My benefactor!"i rise.i stand.the dark figure beside, he sits.a disk of flesh color spinning in place.The world becomes clear in phases.A flash here, and return to madness.I call this phasing.Far from frustration, the contrast makes the high even better.Sometimes I just want to get lost.But sometimes it's nice to see the world in two ways.Flicking the light switch.Now I see the man, dark suit and bowler hat.Old-timey, square jaw and flint eyes.Thick eyebrows.Well-kept.The kind of guy who looks like he'd smack is wife if his dinner wasn't hot at 5 o'clock sharp.A mean guy.*Just need to get a breath of fresh air, now and then.You get to be cooped up after a while.*

A voice, yes.A body, no.Where the line is drawn, I never know.See this?The uncertainty?How can someone ever drive a stake in the ground, pull a string taught from it, and draw a circle, and say that within this is what I know?In a manner of speaking, of course.That's just it.No way to know what works, what is real, what is acknowledged.What can be known for sure.*I quite enjoy the room, you know.It's got some view.It's like going to the movies and seeing the character descend into madness.But I don't need to do it myself, you know?Living vicariously through people whose lives we don't want.That's the new American Dream, you know.It's too hard to actually do it.But experiencing it?That's easy.*

i swim.i swim through air, sea of nothing fog.then i am in my bed, and time commences to discommence.i enter void and days go, hours go.sometimes shafts of light, sometimes shafts of night.but always moonlight, only positive or negative.my fish is dead.i held ceremony, sang sweet elegy to his name.Martin.Martin i called him.pain gnaws in the middle of me and i am missing something.the cosmos swirl and i am of it.the buzz.the hum of time and ratcheting gears of things i must remember.i must.i must...Awake.Sunlight.Thirsty.Hungry.Adjectives and nouns come one by one.I know it's the end of a bender.Pharmaceuticals mixed with mental illness can send you on a journey.Only afterwords do you decide if it was a trip worth taking.There's a cold bowl of soup next to my bed and slippers on the floor, ready to slip my feet into.A card draw in crayon propped up behind the soup.A picture of a goldfish with letter x's for eyes.Inside: "Sorry about Martin."I come back to life, slowly, attend to my human needs.Bathroom.Food.A shower has never felt so glorious.When I am fully alive again, I go to my desk to write, hopefully, while I still have the clarity for it.I go to sit down, and stop in half-crouch.An envelope is on the corner of my desk.Shaking, I look inside.Two thousand dollars, and a scrawled note:

*Sorry about the mess.*
