I had seen those words.All those years ago."Don't tell them you can see."They covered everything and I had ignored them, but only on my deathbed.I had thought that it did not matter.In an act of defiance when dieing of cancer I had told them.I was a fool.I have learned long ago that people don't need to die.Not anymore.Not of cancer, not of pain, not of broken hearts, not of age... And certainly not from having ones eyes torn from their head.They let people die.They can save everyone, can keep anyone alive form anything, but it's not a benefit.It's a curse that they inflect upon those who are useful.They can even heal wounds and restore limbs, other body parts.Such as the eyes they have taken from me.Countless times.They say they are looking for a cure.That my suffering is to help the world.That sight can be restored to all if only they could find the way.Though I know from the cruetly I am shown that they are lying.I know not what my eyes have been used for, but I know it's not for the benefit of all.Maybe the benefit of all the wealthy who can pay them.Today I am trying something knew.Something different to escape this pain, suffering, and this so called "life" that should have ended long ago.I have found the necessary material.An ancient power source called black gold.Marcus sets down his pen.Finishing the entry into his diary.Long ago he had lost count of days or entries.Though he dutifully adds a number to the entry.Storing the diary in his room which is lavish but still the worst prison he had ever thought possible.Marcus takes the black gold and materials from the room.Preparing to do what must be done.Sitting cross legged as monks had done of occasion long ago in the time of sight.He willed himself to not make a sound lest he be found and "saved".As the world went bright with flame then dark as death comes  "Please let this be the last time" Marcus thinks.
