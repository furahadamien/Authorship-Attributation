I looked up at him; a pair of black eyes met mine  a look of fear and hostility in those eyes.I was taken aback.I learnt about my gift from a very early age; surprisingly enough I never faced any suspicion.Youre a polyglot, Sammy, said my uncle wryly.But he never questioned how I came to be one.And it may sound surprising but I never felt bothered to question it much.I had much fun in college, talking to many international students, learnt so much from them.To tell the truth, it has been my opinion  deep down in my heart  that I am special and gifted, and I took this as granted.Many people are born with so many innate abilities, this is mine and I am proud of it.I looked at him closely; he is young, barely in his twenties.His thin pale face becoming thinner by the minute.He is scrutinizing me too, what is he seeing in me?I wonder what conclusion he is arriving at in his mind.I tried to smile at him.I thought of telling him that I am a linguist, I learnt it in a course in college, which is a lie of course.But I understood it is not a lighthearted situation.The young man standing before me looks too upset.Nobodys spoken that language in thousands of years, he said slowly, almost as if to himself.I heard pain in his voice, evoking in me some unknown, unnameable memory of things in me, of occurrences which never happened to me, but I could feel  in my heart of hearts  that these things happened, somewhere, sometime  in this very world.His lips are trembling now, he is in the verge of tears.He is one of the bearers of the knowledge, belonging to a small set of survivors, who fled and evaded from enemies, carrying what part of their identity that they could  their culture and their language.A handful of texts which survived at a great cost, taught to the young ones with a warning of never speaking it in the outside world.The memory is still there, of persecution, of being hunted like animals.Eons have passed, but the fear remains, so does the pain.All these I came to know, standing there, staring at each other.A shared past, of mutual destruction, humanitys worst crimes, history not recorded.But it did not get erased, I came to know it never will be erased.I came out of the McDonalds, under the glaring sun.
