TheAbyssalSymphony
I remember it like it was yesterday, though I gotta say I was surprised when the news broke.Nobody say it coming, but there they were, the same faces I'd seen for the last 40 some years, talking about how some old nutjobs were out there killing immortals and stealing some of their youth in the process.You see somewhere along the line the drug had apparently mutated, and though the effects weren't discovered at first, due largely to the decrease in crime and the fact that very few 80 year olds have a mind for murder, especially not since the reparations had left the few truly old very, very wealthy.Well it wasn't long after that the real shit started.At first, it was just nervous glances from the babyfaced as you'd walk down the street, a whisper here and there, but pretty soon fear set in as the ugly truths became more apparent.You see nobody wanted to die, the immortals, a generation built on doing everything they could for there own self preservation, from the birth bans to advancements in life saving technologies, well they were horrified at the thought someone might try and kill them, and the old... Well for the old it seemed a lot less complicated, they knew they were dying, and after staring down from the gilded cages as they were given money and others luxuries well being denied the youth they sought so much, well they quickly realized they now had a choice.Pretty soon to immortals realized it to, and soon words like concentration camps and safety started getting used, old people started vanishing and pretty soon the Cleansing began.Though what the world quickly realized was it wasn't just youth that was taken, but power too, and soon the old that escaped the initial cleanse started fighting back.Many of those that had survived were those who had killed towards the beginning, most of them murders and crazies, even a few crime bosses and the like.Well as you might imagine even with their newfound powers it didn't go well for most, sure they had the best black market weapons money could buy, but they were still severely outnumbered.But for a few of them, well a few of them managed to grow strong, and I mean really strong.Godlike strong.These guys got so powerful, gone were the frail old men they had been, and in their place were supermen with body's like steel, and once they got that strong it wasn't long before these bulletproof terrors would kill a few hundred more and get to where even a tank couldn't stop them.That's when the Murder's War really hit its peak, with the immortal masses desperately trying to wipe out as many of the old before they killed them and grew unstoppable.Eventually it ended in an uneasy draw of sorts, the average person might even say nobody really won, but the world knew better deep down.See most of the "old" did end up getting killed, and for the most part the immortals went back to their daily lives.But now you have these kingpin of the underworld, these old rulers who have grown so strong that they can basically do whatever they want.Now there's not many, since most of them hate competition plenty of them have killed each other off, but behind the scenes they are the true power now.Now you may be wondering at this point where I fit into all of this, well I was one of the "lucky" ones, if you can call it that.See I aged and grew old until all this started, but when they came for me I fought back, and was able to regain my youth, and with it I hid.I hid from the majority of the war, the fighting, and the ensues purges when the kingpins tried to eliminate any competition.So now I do my best to lay low, but with it I face a new curse from my an old enemy, time.Time is the one thing it seems you can never truly escape, and so now I find I must kill if I'm to remain hidden.A contradiction I struggle with, that has forced me to become a hired gun for the very men I wish to avoid.For only as a killer can I keep from being found, and only from their ranks can I get away with it without drawing attention.So I do their dirty work, for now...
