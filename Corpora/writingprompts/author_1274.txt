Christmas.Again.Shit.I get out of bed, ready for a day full of the terrible reminder that my life has fallen apart, and that I am the cause of the destruction.Its tough to feel that way, but evidently not impossible.My kids, actually biologic step kids, are with their biological fathers brother, due to some bull shit drama that my lawyer is currently slaying.So, I don't even get to spend XMas with my kids.My wife and I are more room mates than a couple anymore.Maybe the pain pills made her more relaxed, or something, but since she's clean, she's just a simple bitch.I love her more than life, but it seems one sided.Shit, we sleep in different beds, like fucking roommates.We haven't had sex in eight weeks and three days.And its okay, really, I like sex as much as the next guy, but its not like food or water.One can live without sex.When she was forced to have an emergency hysterectomy the end result left her with a few problems that make sex ultra painful for her and knowing that keeps me from enjoying it, and that creates a snowball effect.However, as I do every morning before work I fire the phone up and load Reddit.There on the front page is a stranger, wishing the entire world a Happy day.Honestly, at first I was bitter.I can't lie.However the sentiment of that prompt, had managed to worm its way into my heart.I tried working through the day, just as I have the last four years, but that damned prompt kept sneaking back in.How that's even possible I don't know.I just know that for some reason, I smiled.A real smile.The first one in months that wasn't forces or just a polite response.So, to OP, thank you, and I hope that you and your have had a Wonderful Christmas.
