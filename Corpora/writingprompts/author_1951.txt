As I finished telling my dream to my psychiatrist, I could see tears building up in his eyes and right before he uttered a word he broke in to laughter and started slapping his knee like a mad man then said."listen her you chum just because your running low on your income doesn't mean I am going to go out my why and give you a free consultation.I mean Jesus Christ the amount of effort you putt in to make up such a ridiculous dream just so I could tell you that you don't have to pay.So tell me who's work have you been reading Freud?,Brunswick?, or is it Benslama?"Before he could finish his rant a m runs in with a gun throws him on the ground keeps shooting him tell he screeches, then turns to me and says "your safe now David is here".
