I never liked New York.Too loud, too many people, too many opportunities.Unfortunately, I don't get to choose where I go.It's not the first time I've been here, and I'm sure it won't be the last.I looked around as I walked down one of the bigger streets, moving towards the large pillar of black smoke that hung in the air.All these people walked with me, yet none of them moved.Cars and buses on the road, frozen in time.As I always do, I found a man eyeing a woman, and joined their hands.When time resumes, they'll both be embarrassed, and more than a little confused.Most often, I imagine they'll stammer something out about an accident and move along.But I like to think that maybe just once over the millennia, they started talking to each other.That I started something good, that I was a positive force in the world.As I got closer I saw the building, which was completely encapsulated by frozen flame.On the sidewalk across the street were the usual signs; a few people covered in ash, faces locked in a scream, limbs stuck at odd angles.A cat with burned fur, and even a hamster upside down on the ground.I moved next to the people and stood perfectly still.I heard the Chosen burst through the front door of the building, and put yet another person on the ground next to me.The Chosen came into my line of sight then; this one was a woman in her mid 30's.She didn't notice that I was new to the scene, because of course, she knew that no one else can move while time was stopped.She must have missed me the first time.Of course.You see, it always goes the same way.People saved from a fire, an evil emperor dethroned; an invisible hero emerges.Perhaps God had returned to humanity, or children's stories had finally come to life.Usually this lasts for years, once even a decade.But eventually, the reality of the situation sets in for the Chosen.They save thousands of lives, but millions more need saving.People will always be in danger, and the infinite nature of their own lives makes the constant effort seem worthless.They grow bored of being the hero, and come to understand that they can really do *anything* they want.It starts small- a bit of money missing from a bank, a politician acting strange.But as it's said, absolute power corrupts absolutely.The Chosen grow more controlling, more bold.I was born under Cesar, who was the last Chosen to go unchecked.A few minutes later, it seemed the woman had saved everyone in the building.Nine people in total; an impressive hero indeed.As she stood back to admire her work, I drew the same knife I had used to kill Cesar all those years before and cleanly cut her throat.I hate seeing their faces as they die.So innocent, so surprised.Like her, they're all firstly confused because someone else could move while time was locked.But even more, they didn't understand why someone would kill a person who only wanted to help.But how could they?They haven't seen what I have, nor the course that they all will take.Time launched back into motion, and the chaos of the situation resumed.Amid sirens and screaming, I ran a couple blocks away from the building and joined a mass of people staring at the fire.It would be about 10 years before another would be Chosen.10 years to think about the people I've killed, to think about the monster who snuffs out the light before it can burn too bright.
