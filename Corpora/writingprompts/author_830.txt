I stared down at it, a black, unmoving point on an otherwise clean sheet of a white-grey faux-granite counter-top.This was the third one this week alone, damned spiders, testing the very limit of my patience.With a heavy sigh, I gathered up the usual equipment: a glass and a piece of paper, and returned to the invader.It hadn't moved.At all.I almost thought it was dead, but when I lowed the paper to scoop it up it walked up into the middle and got comfortable.This was a game.Wasn't it?I left the glass on the counter and walked the spider on its paper chariot out to the sliding-glass door and set the whole paper down on the patio."Today you, tomorrow me.Tell your buddies."It hesitated, first leg stretched out, waiting, as if I had anything else to tell a spider.When I said nothing, it scurried off into the grass, probably to do spider things.Like hunt.And eat.And be good at spider things.The TV flickered the same stuff it always did.I paid it as much mind as I usually did as I walked past it and dropped myself down on the couch.Nothing.There was nothing.Bills, yes.Mounting as they tended to do.Faster than the bottom line in the bank account.Especially now.Especially with the job gone and the last severance cheque spent.The phone never rang.Never buzzed.Email was always empty, even when there was unread mail.I found myself staring again.At the blank wall.Thought about going to bed, but the clock read four-in-the-afternoon.The light from the TV changed from blue to white, just outside of my line-of-sight.There was no sound, but I don't remember ever hitting mute.I guess four-o-clock isn't _that_ early.I stood up, lingering by the couch as a point of black on the wall caught my eye."Again?""Yesterday was me, today is you.""W-what?""Yesterday was me.Today is you."I turned to the bottle of pills the doctor had given me.It sat on the counter, where it belonged, top screwed on tightly.Beside it were a pair of black dots."Last week was me.Today is you.""A month was me.Today is you."Madness.Madness was finally grasping the last few straws left in the jar of my mind."Come.""Come.""Come.""Follow us.Today is you."With no pause I headed straight back to the bed room, arms waving as I walked through the invisible strands of webbing that grew thicker and thicker the farther I went back into the darkness.They grew thicker and thicker, tangling into my hair, hanging from my dress and my ears, clouding my vision as it all grew colder, drier, calmer, blacker.They scurried across me."Today is you.""Today is you.""Today is you."The webs were as thick as ropes.Sticker than honey.But I paid them no mind.Passed through them.Followed the chanting further and further back.Inches became feet, feet became yards, and the yards vanished behind me until the light of the living room was a distant memory.Far beyond sight.There I came upon her.From the waist up: human.From the wait down: spider.She was beautiful.Graceful, face, white dress made of countless threads woven together.Lacy.Delicate.Against her coal-black skin and the brownish fur of her abdomen.As the dream-world took form, I could make out that her human bit was not much larger than I."Hello... Human..." She shifted, slowly, 

"H-hello.A-a-re you hurt?"She smiled, but only with her lips.Her eyes were weary; they tracked me slowly as I made my way through her chambers.Her third leg, on the left, it hung limply despite the best attempts of her tiny retainers to patch her up.I reached out, brushing stiff hairs out of the way.She didn't recoil.She might've not been able to.Instead, she just watched as I found the wound.Deep, festering.It broke through the tough outer shell and cut into the open artery below, letting her blood seep out and down along the rest of the leg in pulsing rivulets."What happened?""Human wacked me," she said."You?""I was smaller.At the time.""You know...I was reading the Wikipedia article on spiders the other day..."

"Is that what you do?""It is now," I said."Keeps me sane.Apparently didn't work.""Do you know what to do?"I looked at the wound again and put my hand over the opening.Blood flowed behind my hand, pushing against my palm, and the leg twitched.Slightly.But I couldn't keep my hand there long.The pressure built and it wasn't long before my strength failed and my face was sprayed with blood."I know what to do..." I said between coughs and gags."I need a rock.A sharp rock!"I told the thousands of spiders that surrounded me and the beast.It wasn't long before one came riding a living wave to my feet."Perfect."Working quickly, I stuck the rock through my dress, just below my knees, and sawed.Once it was big enough, I stuck my hands into the hole and ripped it the rest of the way until my dress was reduced to a tiny skirt.With the large strip of fabric, I began tearing more pieces.A big one.Several thin strips.And when I had them all I stopped the wound, and tied the strips as tightly as I could until the wound was just about entirely closed.Only then did I stop to wipe my face and took a moment to admire my handiwork."There."The spider queen stretched the leg out, slowly, testing it as the strength slowly seeped back into the very end.She lowered it to the ground, trying to put pressure on it, but found it weak.Too weak to hold its share."It won't be instant," I said."You need to rest some more."She shifted around, seven legs working in tandem to make up for the weak link.With her human hand she reached out and stroked my chin before leaning over and planting a kiss on my forehead."My children said you'd know what to do.How right they were.""T-thank you.""No.Thank you.What is your name, human?""Evelyn... but I prefer E-V."

"Well, E-V, go now, with the blessing of Lolth - Queen of Spiders."Behind me, a light twinkled.I could just barely make out the TV over the hum of spiders.I turned, as if I was going to walk away.Go back to real life.With bills.And news.And no direction."Actually, that wound isn't going to heal overnight.You might want someone to stick around.You know, keep it clean.Maybe even give you someone new to talk to.I can definitely use a friend."For a moment, I thought she was going to say 'no'.But the stunned look soon gave way to a girlish squeal, and with the strength of three men she picked me off the ground in her human arms and hugged me tight.After that little slip up, she cleared her throat and patted down her lace top."Well then.I declare thee E-V - Princess of Spiders."I bowed down, as I thought was appropriate and there, below the ragged remains of my dress, was not the two human legs I expected, rather, the back-half of a spider and all eight legs, waiting for my command.
