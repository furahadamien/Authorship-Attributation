"You are loved and accepted for who you are.Have a happy holiday season, and a great new year!"A small gesture, a roll of the eyes towards the inanimate object in my hand which presents this message.For some reason, compelled to respond.*"What does that even mean?"* I ask, almost incredulous at the shallow and empty affirmation presented.*"What is it that you expect from me?"*

The response has already pushed through as I attempt to type out that question, and I already know the answer."Stop being so negative.It is a statement of good will."*"To what end?It certainly isn't intended to help me."*

"Then that is your problem.You are loved and accepted for who you are."*"Who is it that means that?"*

"It doesn't matter.Have a happy holiday season, and a great new year!"*"How?After everything else, how?"*

"You'll figure it out."*"Then why even post this prompt?What do you want from me if I feel no love, and no hope?"*

"The same thing you're hoping to get from submitting a response."
