"Let me see that cook book!"snarled the red, leathery creature.I extended it, shaking like an over-caffeinated parkinson's victim.The demon took a step toward me, its bones jostling under the shift of its weight, and swiped the book from my hand."Where did you get this cook book?!""It was a gi-gift!"I stammered, still trembling."From WHO?"the demon demanded.Its breath smelled of pure sulfur, and felt like the steam of a freshly nuked lean-cuisine against my face."My-my-my gi--" I couldn't get a word out."Yo-yo-your girlfriend?"the demon mocked me."Yes."I said, hoping I had not just thrown her under the bus."We must summon her at once," the demon said excitedly."I require a lock of her hair, and an object of her affection.""Why don't I just call her?"I asked as I pulled out my cell phone.The demon snapped backward, hissing like a house cat."What is that?"the suddenly fragile looking demon asked."My cell phone..." I said."I can just call her.""And that will summon her?"the demon asked, inquisitively, its face was both old, and youthful at the same time."Sure," I said."but promise me you're not going to hurt her."The demon tilted its head."Why would I... no, hey, you got us all wrong, I would never--"

"What, demons are...good?"I asked."What is *'good'*, but a human social construct designed to perpetuate the status quo?"the demon asked as he leaned casually against my kitchen counter.I was taken aback."Uh..." I felt a grin form on my face."I must be losing my mind... maybe I'm having an aneurysm."I pondered as I examined the backs of my hands."Human, you have much to learn."the demon said with the compassion of a loving parent.
