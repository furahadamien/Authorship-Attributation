It's a simple thing... All must come to an end.So simple, in fact, that it has eluded me for millennia.These mortals, that I so abruptly ended their existence in the past, never seemed to affect me.Never has there seemed to be a connection between me and these... these insignificant specks in this magnificent universe.Until now.They've wasted a unique opportunity.Wasted a gift like none other.Their petty fueds of race, religion, patriotism... Hell, even their constant lack of care towards others they're close to is still astounding to me.I used to relish taking one from their happy little world.Now, though, now it's taking a toll.Now, it's killing me.Me!How did my existence get entagled with this mess of beings?Their numbers have dwindled.Less than a million left.Each one I take now has a price.I'm fading with each soul I reap.Weaker, slower, less in touch with the Cosmos.I even feel pain now!Pain!How?How!It was just a word they would use!I've become so desperate now that I try to save some.It's selfish, I know.But hey, I can't let them kill me as well.I'm not ready for that.They still keep trying to kill each other.Still try to eradicate their species.If I wasn't tied to them...I'd let them.Assholes.I have to get creative to keep them alive, keep myself alive.They've even started calling me Life.Ha, Death becomes Life.Life.Such a thing is precious.The Cosmos doesn't do it often, and most often it's not a thing of beauty.It's just unaware, unintelligent things that only want to reproduce.Humans, though, were different.And they squandered it.I have to preform miracles to keep them, and me, alive.
