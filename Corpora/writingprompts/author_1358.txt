Wed finally found it.Quadrillions gathered from every corner of known space.Galarts standing side by side with Raphons as they had not for centuries.The jelly sacks of the Quinellions, the universes top linguists, quivering in the rapid pulsing language of their kind as their top scientists eagerly discussed what astounding finds would come from this discovery.The ancient race, that species that had seeded all life in the galaxy, they who had come from the mud and dirt without a single soul in the galaxy yet ready to greet them.They had leapt from their planet only to find space was as cold and empty as it might seem.. now though, all these billions of years later, the galaxy was full of life and all of it was focused on this singular event.Beings throughout the ages had found the artifacts left behind by those early pioneers.Artifacts such as the great green amphibian atop his mono-wheeled vehicle, statues of which littered the universe.Artifacts like the temples theyd build worshipping a sharply dressed god with no face or name.Artifacts like the way theyd rearranged the stars themselves to form a shape that all agreed was a message.A message that must have been so crucially vital they could never let it be forgotten by another sentient species across all of time.No one had understood what these things meant because there wasnt enough of their language left to decrypt the message.No one knew if these beings of myth and legend had met with disaster, evolved beyond the physical, or simply settled down to become all the life the universe knew today.Their amazing technology lost to war and the ravages of time.However every species today agreed that the message would unlock the key to their control over time and space.The end of territory disputes.The end of hunger and energy shortages.Every school child could draw the star message from memory, that message that would end all war, drawn across the night sky.Visible from a hundred thousand worlds, and telegraphed electronically to all the others throughout history.Finally we would know what it meant, for we had found their home planet, we had carbon dated the remains of civilization on this planet and were certain this was the cradle of their galaxy spanning empire.That there would be enough tech buried in the dust to finally decipher their language.It wouldnt be easy, but with the unanimous backing of every sentient species in the galaxy it would come to fruition.Every being in existence waited with hope and awe as the scientists worked on this grandest of problems.One small child absentmindedly exhaled on the window of his spacecraft, staring at this message in the stars that spanned hundreds of solar systems, which he had grown up watching burn across the cosmos his entire life.He traced the shape with his finger:
