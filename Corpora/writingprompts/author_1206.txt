Fuck, this made me emotional again.Went to a party on Friday and I'm always anxious around people, the more the heavier.I drank some, smoked some, and suddenly someone leaned over to me and said somewhat out of the blue: "you're a very nice guy, you are great the way you are and you deserve to be here."It made me very emotional and got me talking about my social anxiety.I cried, I felt ashamed, I felt angry for the machine in my head and I started to talk about everything.We hugged and spoke some more about how nobody can actually figure his brain out and after that I felt accepted.I just hope this time it will stick with me for once...
