I just went into the bank for a second.The ATM was broken and I just needed to withdraw some money.Just enough to take care of some expenses before I start my new job."In and out in five minutes" I told myself.And for a few minutes, it looked like that's what would happen."GET ON THE GROUND!"I whipped my head around.Looking back, I should've just put my hands up and laid on the floor, but.I saw them.Two men and a woman, all wearing ski masks and suits that probably cost more than my car.The man wearing a gray suit was brandishing n assault rifle, a woman wearing a dark gray suit and was holding a submachine gun, and a hulking giant of a man brandishing a shotgun that almost seemed small in his hands."I SAID-" He reached back with his shotgun."GET ON THE GROUND!"The brute bashed my forehead in with the butt of his shotgun.I hit the ground with a thud, my head was swimming.For a second, I thought that I might have been dead, until I felt someone rough force me face down.It may have been one of the robbers, but it couldve been Joan of Arc for all I knew.As sense returned to me, I could make out what one of the robbers was saying." want all the money in the drawers.And none of that dye pack bullshit, neither!"The gray suited man said, plopping a large duffle bag on the counter.Dont try anything stupid The large man in the tan suit bellowed.He pumped his shotgun for emphasis.The banks money in insured, and you wont get any medals for playing hero.Except the metal coming from this gun, alright?

One of the tellers started emptying the money from the cash drawers into the duffel bag.Before her coworker could follow suit, the gray suited man gestured to the woman in the black suit.K, take our friend here..." He motioned to the other teller."And get the vault.""Come on, ya little shit!"The black suited woman said as she grabbed the other teller by the arm, keeping her other hand on her submachine gun.I was lucky that I had my face pressed against the linoleum floor (which hadnt seemed to have been cleaned since Carter was in office) because I couldnt stop myself from smiling.It took every ounce of willpower I had not to laugh.These guys wanted to get in the vault?It looks like theyre breaking the cardinal rule of thieving.Always make sure that what you want to steal is there.Granted, I couldn't blame them.When I first saw the massive steel door that went floor to ceiling, I thought there was something important there too.Hell, I only found out what they actually keep in there because someone accidentally left the vault open when I went here back in college.These banks dont keep their money in the massive safes they have near their lobbys.Its where they keep their office supplies, and they do it specifically to throw off people who didn't know what they were doing.T-the vaults on a time release lock I can unlock it, but it takes ten minutes to open The teller stammers.SHUT UP! The woman in the gray suit shouted.She looks like shes about to hit the teller, but then, the black suited woman gets a wicked grin and turns her gun to the lobby floor, right at me.We arent waiting around for ten minutes.If you don figure something out, then Ill shoot one of the customers, then another, and another, until we get what we want

I grunted.Yeah, these guys are amateurs, and all of a sudden, I dearly wished that, if I had to be caught up in a robbery, that the people would be professionals.A professional crew wouldve been in and out with no ne getting hurt unless they had to.After all, people getting hurt means more years in jail if youre caught.A rookie crew would kill everyone in the bank because they didnt know any better.Save yourself some time and just leave with what you have now I say, doing my damnest to keep calm.Unless you need about 50 packs of printing paper, youd be better off just taking what you have and leaving.

At that, the gray suited man walks briskly up to me.I dont know what hes going to do, until he boots me right in the ribs.I try to let out a yell, but all that comes out is a strangled gasp.If you dont shut the fuck up, Im gonna put a bullet in your brain, you got it? The gray suited man said.Im serious.The metal door is worth more in scrap than what they keep in the vault I plead.Its just office supplies.Pens and rubber bands.Stuff like that.

The gray suited man just grunts.I think I hear him mutter 'You really expect me to believe that?'The next ten minutes were the longest of my life.Waiting for the door to open, dreading that someone would come in the bank and these crooks would shoot them, that they might shoot someone anyway when they get the vault open.All the while, Im just hoping, praying that someone managed to hit the silent alarm.*Click*

*Whirr*

Finally, the vault door opens.The crooks cheers and whoops only last until they look inside.Theres no stacks of money sitting on a table.No bars of gold.Not even safety deposit boxes.Just a shelf on the right side of the vault with boxes of printer paper, rubber bands, staplers, pens, and a bunch of other worthless crap.I dont look up at the robbers.I dont say I told you so.What are we gonna do, M? The tan suited man yells.We cant go back with this.Its barely anything! He gestures to the duffelbag, still looking pathetically empty.Shut up, let me think The gray suited man says.I think I hear him mutter This wasnt in the plan..As he paces back and forth.Finally, he snaps to his cohorts.Alright, K, take everything you can from these guys.Wallets, jewelry, everything worth a damn.T, make sure they dont try anything

Eh, after we give the boss his cut maybe thisll pay for the gas we used to drive here The black suited woman mutters.But she gets to work, digging through pockets, even ripping a necklace off of one of the tellers.When she comes to me, she opens my wallet.Danial Martin huh Lives at 4950 W. Corrinth... ? The woman said as she held up my wallet.What the fuck? I ask, mostly out of reflex.She pointed her gun at my temple."Because you look like a loudmouth.Someone whose gonna talk.And I wanna know who to pay a visit just in case you do" 

W-h-h-hat did you say his name was? The gray suited man asked.He was still as a statue.Even under his mask, I could see his eyes widen.Daniel Martin? The woman said looking at my wallet again.The man walks over and snatches the wallet from her hand and stares at my ID.You know this guy?

Know him?Fuck no, but hes on the fucking list! The man in the gray suit shouts.By now hes shaking.Oh no The man in the tan suit says.He looks at me.FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK

What list?! The black suited woman demands.And stop freaking out, T!, youre embarrassing yourself.And more importantly, me!

The.No.Harm List The gray suited man says, drawing out each syllable and glaring at his cohort.Behind her ski mask, I see her eyes bulge, as she just discovered some horrible truth.Oh God says, her voice cracked.Look we can fix this. No one has to know! The gray suited 
man says as he tries his best to sound reassuring.K, take care of the camera footage!Were getting out of here

K, the black suited woman, scurries, well, thats the best word for it, to the back, presumably to erase the footage.But T, the burly giant of a man, simply stood there, frozen.CAMPBELL! The gray suited man shouted That was enough to get the man moving.Then, the gray suited man knelt down beside me.Look, we didnt know, okay?We were just here for the money.Please dont tell Silvia!Shed skin us alive!

Silvia? I say.I I only know one person named Silvia, Silvia Bishop.And I havent seen her in years.Hell, I barely saw her after high school.She was my first, and so far, only girlfriend.She was well, she was one of the nicest people in my school.A bit awkward, but everyone knew her.But Silvia had a fire in her heart.When she set her sights on something, she was going to get it.Whether it was staying up all night to pass a Calculus exam, whipping per partners into shape for a group project.Even back then, I figured that if one of us got into crime, it'd be me.And especially didn't she'd be the kind of person who'd skin people alive.It had to be a different Silvia.Right?*Right?*

...I'm going to need to make some phone calls.As soon as my ribs stop hurting.
