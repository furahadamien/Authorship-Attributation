A grey Charge approached me from across the street & lowered his ears in deference before exchanging the traditional sniff greeting."The preparations for The Howl are complete, as you requested," he grumbled, avoiding my eyes."Thank you," I panted.While I wagged my golden tail in appreciation, my heart was heavy.All the arrangements were finished, & the Long Walk could begin.I trotted back inside the Den to the door & solemnly lifted a worn leather leash in my mouth.It tasted of tall grass, the forest outside our Den, & faded memories of my puppyhood.My ears & tail drooped involuntarily before I composed myself & lifted my head.Walking deeper into the Den my family & had spent the last seven generations in, I did my best to ignore the scent of sterile tiles & cleaning products.The inclusion of the smells had been gradual enough that the rest of my Pack hadn't noticed them until they became almost unbearable, but I'd known from the first whiff exactly what they'd meant for us.It had been a struggle to pretend nothing was wrong as I watched our Guardian's skin turn as thin as newspaper, & Her eyes cloud.Despite the knowledge of that Her time was coming, She never once flagged in Her duties, ensuring our Den was clean & that we were well fed & groomed.My tail threatened to droop, & the antiseptic smell threatened to overwhelm- but I pressed on, & shortly reached my Guardian's door.I slipped through to see Her lying on Her bed.Her chest rose & fell in slow, shallow breaths that made me ache.I placed my head on the bed next to Her & gently washed Her face.Her eyes opened, & as She stared upward at the ceiling above Her, I saw the sudden flash of confusion that had become more & more common in the past moons.As She turned towards me, though, recognition dawned, & She bared her teeth in happiness.Reaching up to pet my head, She noticed the leash in my mouth, & Her face immediately fell.Her cloudy eyes looked like they would spill over for a moment, but after a few breaths, She gathered Herself & rose with a small sigh.Though She did Her best to conceal it, I could tell She was in pain.I let out a soft whine, & She stopped for a moment to stroke me.I closed my eyes & listened to Her ragged heart through Her hands.It was time.She clipped my leash on & we stepped outside.Up & down the block, Charges & their Guardians were lined up outside their Dens.We moved into the center of the street, & the procession began.As we passed each Den, the Guardians & Charges bowed, then fell in behind us at a respectful distance.My Guardian pulled Herself to Her full height & moved like She once did when I was still a pup, & Her warmth was as familiar & comforting as my own Dams'.Her fur tumbled around Her in the wind like a living thing, spreading the now faded scent of flowers She was known for, & we continued forward.We reached the building in what felt like no time at all.The Long Walk was meant to allow the Charge & Guardian to spend enough time together to speak of the things most important to them, but we had said nothing.There was no need.Her touch & movements had conveyed all they needed to; Pride in Her work, joy at being recognized for it, & deep sorrow for leaving before more could be completed.An Acolyte exited the building.He was lean, long, & younger than any potential Guardian I'd seen before.He bowed deeply before my Guardian, then knelt on the ground before me, stretching out his hands.I went to him, & made my examination.Nervous, but loyal.Physically weak, but with deep convictions.Inexperienced, but exuberant.He would make a good Guardian for my Pack.I placed my paw in his & licked his face.Our contract complete, I stepped back to my former Guardian's side, & she handed my leash to Him, now simply an old woman ready to move on.She turned & looked at us, pushing her fur out of her eyes.Slowly, she reached a shaking hand out to me one last time.I wagged my tail, but stayed beside my new Guardian.I wanted to run to her & leap into her arms, to follow her into the building wherever it might lead, but there were consequences for such actions.She bared her teeth once more, then came forward & stroked my head.Even as her skin met my fur, I could hear her heart flagging, & my own nearly broke."Good boy," she murmured."Such a good, good boy."Then she turned & entered the building, leaving a faint trail of flower scent behind as the only sign she'd even been here.The Howl started behind me, lamenting the passing of a Guardian, & the completion of a contract for a new one.Each Charge & Guardian slowly dropped out & returned to their Dens one by one until my Guardian & I were the only ones left in the street.His hand on my leash was firm, & he smelled of crisp winter air & hope.I pressed my side into His leg, felt His heart beating strong & sure, & slowly we turned to move towards my Pack's ancient home as the building's doors' shut behind us.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
