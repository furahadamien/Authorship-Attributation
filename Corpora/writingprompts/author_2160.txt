The Chameleon hung from the rafters of the headquarters cafeteria, listening in on various superhero conversations.A raucous laughter drew his attention.Im serious!Whenever Manman shows up, its like all the villains just give up.I swear to god!I saw him use his super breath - which cant even blow out the candles on his friggin birthday cake anymore - and General Pain just lay down like Ma  

Now, wait a minute, Agent Wonder.You are brand new here. The Director piped in with a raised voice, biting off each word, Manman was around before you were a twinkle in your Dads eye.He fought crime and cleaned up Cityburg before our headquarters existed.Hes the reason you have to leave the city to find work.  The Director, pausing for effect, met each pair of eyes at the table until their head lowered, He has accomplished more in his lifetime than the whole group of you will think about accomplishing in your, no doubt, short super existence.Youd do well to look upon Manman as a hero.Study his moves.Even imitate him.  With his point made, The Director walked briskly away.The Chameleon laughed internally at the shame he saw.*These guys have no confidence.I could probably take them all out by myself.*  

Why didnt you all tell me he was behind me? Agent Wonder asked accusingly.Dude you know The Director can be listening at any moment.  Thunder Giant said as he watched The Director round the corner to the hall.He continued in hushed tones, I know what you mean, though, Wonder.About a month before he retired, using air quotes for the last word, I saw Manman hold off the Army of Evil in a cardboard fort using snow balls.The entire Army of Evil.Not just a couple of them.ALL OF THEM.And Im not certain of it, but I thought I heard the Army of Evil giggling.Laughing even.I mean, Manman still had a decent amount of strength back then, and a tightly compacted snowball to the face sucks, but, come on!   

The rest of the group sat, unconvinced, eying Thunder Giant doubtfully as the words sank in.The Chameleon saw a mixture of incredulity and disgust on the groups faces as he smiled at the memory of what would come to be known to every supervillain as The Great Fight.A flurry of snowballs flew past his face.The Chameleon rushed the enemy line completely hidden in camouflage.He was just about to take Manman out when a flash of white and red covered his vision.He opened his eyes and wondered why he was looking at sky.He couldnt believe it when a laugh escaped his lips.And not his villain laugh, either, but a full-on laugh from his belly.He hadnt laughed like that in ages.He didnt even know he was capable of it anymore.Of course, Manman now had his position and he was pelted with snowballs as he ran away, but he did so while laughing with glee.It was The Great Fight not because they lost many comrades that day, and not because it was difficult experience, but because it was the most fun any of the villains had had since their innocence was stolen and they were forced into a life of crime.The voices below brought him back to the cafeteria.Thats what Im saying!  Agent Wonder loudly whispered.Its like they just give him a free pass!It makes me wonder if any of the stories of him are true.I dont believe them.Hes washed up now and he was washed up back then.  

The rest of the group still didnt look convinced, but The Chameleon had heard enough.How dare you speak that way about Manman!Manman gave me my first scar.Manman was the reason I was given each of my life sentences and Manman did it with style!I was able to keep my pride intact when Manman allowed me to turn myself in!He even cleaned me up and told me, Next time just believe in yourself and youll accomplish things youve only dreamed about!  And that was exactly what I needed to hear, because I was just about to take a job as a computer technician!  
 
*Uh-oh*, The Chameleon thought.He now looked at an entire army of masked and caped men who were looking back toward him.They couldnt see him, but it was only a matter of time before  *No way!*  

Manman rounded the corner in his super ill-fitting suit.His belly was beginning to peek out from under his shirt and he was hunched over a walking cane but his frame was still imposing.Manman carried his Killerang in his free hand and had it drawn back, ready to throw.You rang?  Manman said in his whispery imitation of his once super voice.Uh I didnt know you came out of retirement Manman.  The Chameleon said apologetically.Oh, Im still retired.I just heard my name!  Manman pointed with his Killerang to the extremely large hearing aids pushing down his ears.Before The Chameleon could respond, Manman threw his Killerang with all his might and The Chameleon fell from the rafters.The Killerang bounced and clattered as it came to a rest only a few feet from Manman, but The Chameleon was now on the floor and in full view of the rest of headquarters.And let that be a lesson to you The Chameleon!  Manman called over his shoulder.*He is the only one who remembers my name.*  Curse you!  The Chameleon yelled while thinking, *God, I love that guy.*  

The onlookers, stunned, mouths agape, tried to figure out what had just happened.The Chameleon smiled as they looked at the Killerang, then at The Chameleon, then back at the Killerang, then back at The Chameleon.They all turned toward the door in unison as The Director said, Still got it, and high-fived a smiling Manman.
