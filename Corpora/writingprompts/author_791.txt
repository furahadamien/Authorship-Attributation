There was one diner they all liked.A small thing with a cute devil head and neon sign out front.They all sat together in a corner of the place, a booth with a circular couch and table."Hey, Lust, how're the kids doing?"Greed leaned in and dug into a burger, juice dripping from his fingers.Lust fingered the air and made a face; Greed's eyes grew and he spat out a half-chewed beef patty."Sweet second coming!Marissa didn't say nothing?""He," Lust corrected.Gluttony reached over, grabbed Greed's half-chewed meat, and crammed it in his mouth, wiping his fingers on the napkin."What about you, Glut?"Greed asked."Oh, I..." Glut shifted in his seat and leaned back, letting his gut sit on the edge of the table."...I got kicked out of an all-you-can-eat by eating too much.""There are all-you-can-eats?"Envy asked, picking out the last fry from the shared plate in the middle."Yeah, it was sooo good.Hey, wrath, remember when we got unlimited sodas because you flipped out about the oil on the plate?"Wrath held up a hand."Just a sec..." He took a drink and then spat it out."SOMEONE change the water here, or so help me God-" A bolt of lightning struck through the roof of the diner and an inch next to him "-I will get Dad to burn this diner to the ground and have all of you at the stake burning in the centergram!"A teenager a table away spoke up."Yeah, Dad's the best, and he'll show you.""Get the fuck outta here, Vainglory."Wrath waves his hand away."Okay, let's cut to the chase."Envy slammed his fist on the table."Why does Pride get his own month every year?""It isn't my month, Envy."Pride drank a glass of water and split one of his two bennies open."It's for the gays.""That's not fair."Gluttony protested."I keep people alive."Pride turned and pointed his fork at him and flung egg yolk at his face."*You* make people fat.At least I keep dignity."It was discussion enough for Wrath to put down his glass."Fuck you!You're not the only deadly sin.There are six others.Make more than half the year our thing.""It's not even my thing!Are you even listening?""I should get two months.I can pay you guys to do it."Greed slid two coins and a piece of the temple veil with a tear down the middle."Eh?"Envy snatched the veil and then stuffed it in Wrath's water."That's not the real veil, and if you get two months I get two months.""You're untrustable," Pride pointed at Greed, "You're just riding Greed's argument," he pointed at Envy, "And if anybody deserves to get two months, it's Glut or Wrath.Just the other day, I saw a guy get into a revenge threesome because he found out his bi girlfriend was cheating on him.You couldn't do that even if you tried.""I kind of took down Wells Fargo," Greed objected.Envy shrugged, not having anything to say."Also, Gluttony is hilarious and I can't stop reading 'Florida Man' headlines.""So, what's your solution?"Greed leaned in."Okay."Pride took out a pen and opened a napkin."January is Sloth month, so that everybody gets screwed off of their New Years resolutions.February is Lust's, because Valentines Day, y'know?"Give March to Gluttony *and* Greed, double trouble, so that he can lead up to St. Pat's and get everybody *wasted* to hell, and April will go to Wrath, because Aries takes up most of the month there."Skip May, June, and July, but give August to Envy so that if there are summer flings, they get destroyed by jealousy.Systematic destruction of God's children.Finally, I'll get December.""Fucking kidding me."Greed spat under his breath."You give yourself two months??What?""No, December because Christmas is about being humble, and I would absolutely fuck that.Reasonable?""What's reasonable is that you cut out your other Pride month.""That's not *my* Pride month, you-"

"That's what you want us to believe!"Wrath stood up, kicking a chair backwards into a wall and shattering it.Pride covered his face with his hands."Shit, this is gonna be a long lunch.Hey, where was Sloth again?"
