Stone cold.Always when it happened I could feel a sudden change drop in temperature, like the vibrating molecules generating heat themselves froze when time did--I assumed somehow the power to move also gave me the ability to survive any physical impossibilities of all motion stopping, but these moments always sent me strange shivers through me.As I had done every time I could recently, I took the chance to look over at her.Her eyes shone animatedly, even when time itself was unmoving; to me the rest of the classroom seemed empty and without life.Her mouth was twisted unattractively in the middle of saying something (telling a joke maybe), long hair resting on her shoulders, hands raised animatedly.Nonetheless, her friends around her sat with expectant expressions on their faces.That boy always tagging beside her was already laughing before she was even done talking.I sent a feeling of commiseration his direction.She always was the most charismatic one out of--well, all of us, really, the single star in the dark space that was our small town high school.The last time time froze she had this coy, playful look on her face that made me wonder whether it was her manipulation of words or the way her body itself seemed like an extension of her personality that the reason that people drew closer to her.Either way it seemed everyone in the entire school was in love with her.The danger in staring (or taking advantage of the pauses at all, really) was that I didn't know when time would unfreeze--and sure enough, before I could react, she raised an eyebrow at me, an open question about my gaze.I looked away quickly, a warmth clinging to my cheeks that was distinct from the wave of humid summer heat that I could suddenly feel again.I don't know when it started exactly--I think the first few times time paused were so brief I probably just shrugged them off.The first pause lengthy enough for me to realize that the world had frozen but I hadn't happened when I was in a car.Seeing all the traffic around (the stony passenger cars with stony-faced passengers, the trucks burdened with the weight of society) in crystal-clear focused detail in the middle of moving at 80 kilometers an hour left me so mesmerized that I hadn't even unbuckled my seatbelt before time resumed.I tried everything, of course, to reproduce the effect; but now, after what must be 200 odd occurrences (that I was aware of, anyway--who knows how many happened when I was asleep) I had more or less concluded that they were random, something out of my own control.I imagined that there was someone out there, using time freezes as a tool to achieve his or her goals, whatever they were.Maybe it was a superhero.Or, maybe it was a less than heroic person?Or what if there was no point to them at all?Just the universe arbitrarily selecting me for this treatment, afflicting me and then leaving me with no explanation.Either way it made me feel minuscule, tiny in the face with great unknown forces I could not understand.Even this love of mine, consuming as it was, felt suddenly and terrifyingly small and unimportant.It seemed to me anyway even if she stayed frozen with the rest of the world, she could take of herself better than whatever I could try to do to help her.The next time it happened I was by the grass field just outside the school area.At the start of lunch period I was seized by the longing to be by myself, away from people.She shot me the second puzzled look of the day as I walked past her to the door in the first floor hallway.I just kept my head down.The long grass that had been moving in the wind now laid there suddenly transfixed, caressed by an invisible hand that now too was frozen.The leaves blown off the rustling shadows of trees beyond the field floated there in mid air, seemingly unperturbed.I turned my gaze to the blue summer sky, scattered by far off cirrus clouds.A plane hung there, in the distance, silent.Laying back against the cool grass by the fence, I put my sandwich down beside me.I closed my eyes, and imagined seeing something moving.
