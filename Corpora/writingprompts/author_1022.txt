"Dad most of the factory workers have left, why do you insist on continuing with this?""Because I made a promise.When you are my age, you will understand that your word is your bond and that is very important in this business"

"First of all I am 30.You've been saying that to me since I was 4.I will never be your age when you keep changing it every year.Second -"

"Now look here son, the tadpole did not learn to hop on its own"

"What does that mean?!And What business?!The economy collapsed.Wake up old man.Just continue living, let these workers go home to their families"

"We made a promise!Its the principle -"

"No one cares about that now.The end of civilization is here.Getting Oreos is the last thing they care about"

"Son, have you asked yourself why these folks come back to run the factory?Why ol' Bill is here bright and early every morning to make the deliveries?People need a purpose.Whatever goals they may have is gone now.Until they decide what to do next, they will come back here and run this factory.This is the only consistent part of their life, this is their purpose"

"Dad sooner or later we need to move along.We have no money to give to these people, we have no food or shelt-"

"We have OREOS DAMMIT!This factory is their home.Sally and her kids sleep in the breakroom with the Calloways.Don't you see this is normancy, this is-"

"Normalcy"

"Huh?""Nevermind"

"These good folk need something to keep preoccupied.And our deliveries, they give our customers solace.Dear old Mrs. Higgins wrote us a nice letter about oreos, sweet Virginia wrote a haiku!To these folk, these deliveries are a sign that civilization still continues"

"But its not"

"You never had faith boy.The other day little Thomas made a joke about oreos, he laughed so hard he fell down.He didn't care that he does not have heat in his home"

"Thats because he has nothing but oreos in his diet"

"And milk"

"... seriously?Besides thats powdered milk"

"Look son, I dont know what will happen 5 years from now.I know whats happening now and what may happen tomorrow.Georgie is smiling now while he runs the conveyer, Annie is preoccupied with the creme mixer, Elena is calculating hypothetical revenue for the year when she knows darn tooting there is no real money.This is a welcome distraction.Just let it be for now.""See... lets leave it at that.Maybe this is something I will understand when I am your age."
