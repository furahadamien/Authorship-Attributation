(This is my first time posting here! )The soul walking beside me wasn't confused.I was, the first time I walked this dimly lit path.It has only one ending, thought it has many beginnings.I was the first.I have many names.Eve.Mother.First Woman.Partner.But most just know me, in the end, as the grim reaper.I wear no cloak and carry no sickle.I simply take your hand as we walk down this long hall to the river.I have no idea if you go to Heaven or Hell, no clue what you did in your life.I only know that when I walked to that long dark river of judgment, I was alone.So I came back to walk with you.All of you.My children, of a sort.The one beside me now holds my hand and it is all warmth and care.I have an idea where they'll go, but make no mention.I do not speak.I do not have any answers to the questions people usually cry out in the dark as I let them have their feelings in privacy.In the end, their feelings do not matter now.Not as they did on Earth.We are nearing the end of the passage now and yet you haven't said a word.Your lips are parted as though you have so much to say but none of it comes out.When we stop at the ferry you face me with a smile that I must return.My cheeks ache from disuse.You keep us company?   I blink in response.No one has ever asked about me.I think it's time for you to go. And I can feel it.A lightness I have never felt.I'll watch them from here. 	You're bright light as you help me into the ferry with a soft kiss to my cheek.I shed a tear.I'm going home.
