*(Since today is Valentine's Day, we decided to put a small Valentine's spin on the story.)*

Steve had only been my owner for a day, but I already loved him.He'd put me in a bright red collar, decorated it with a shiny pink bow, and gave me treats when I sat inside a giant paper box.It was a little strange, and when Steve closed the lid of the box, I was scared for a second thinking he was going to send me back to the kennel, but then Steve's fingers peeked in from a hole in the side with another treat, and I happily lapped it up.A moment later a door opened, and I barked, expecting an intruder.Or a squirrel.There was a high-pitched human shriek, and I barked even louder.What if Steve was in trouble?I had to help him!I leaped up in the box, knocking the lid to the floor, and peeked outside.There was a female human there, bundled up in hat and scarf, grinning and screaming at me.I wasn't sure what to make of it, so I barked at her, and she swooped in and wrapped her arms around my body.Steve and the female honked at each other with their mouths, then pressed their mouths together.They must really feel safe around each other to do that!The female helped me out of the box, gave me a treat, and I loved her too.Over the next days, Steve and his female (whose name I think was Laura, but was hard to tell from human honks) walked me around outside.I sniffed all of the trees, found a perfect one to pee on, and barked at all of the squirrels.It was amazing.At night Steve and Laura would sit on a very soft log (maybe it was made of squirrels?)in front of a glowing screen, and I'd sit on their laps as they'd pet me.It was amazing.But sometimes Steve and Laura would honk at each other in a bad way.They would bare their teeth and growl and I didn't like it.I'd crawl back into the giant paper box I'd come out of, and wait for it to end.When it did, and they found me, they'd come over and honk happily at me, though not as happily as they used to.We went on walks less and less.Steve spent more time in his room alone.Laura spent more time on the soft-log alone, looking at a flat bone in her hands that rang and honked a lot.Something was wrong.Steve and Laura liked each other as much as I liked that hamburger that squeaked when I chewed on it.I needed to help them.I went over to my paper box in the closet and clasped the bright pink ribbon in my teeth.I trotted upstairs to Steve's room and clawed on the door and whimpered until he opened it.He honked angrily at me, but I dashed away downstairs, and he followed.I went over to Laura on the soft-log, set the bow down next to her, and then turned to Steve, panting happily.Steve gazed at the bow next to Laura.She looked up from the flat-bone her hands.They smiled at each other, and I thought that Steve was going to sit next to her and I could lay across their laps like we used to.But instead Steve bent down, rubbed my head, and walked away.The next day we went for a car ride.I was so excited!Maybe we were going to the park.But then a familiar, pungent smell hit me.The kennel.The car pulled up right in front of it and we stopped.I immediately started barking, fighting against Steve and Laura as they pulled me out of the car.Laura was crying and Steve was honking loudly and angrily.He was stronger than me.I couldn't escape.They brought me inside, and the familiar, scary smell paralyzed me.Steve and Laura honked at some woman dressed in white, she honked back, and then after a final pat on the head, they left.What had I done wrong?I tried so hard to make them happy.Why would they bring me back here?I loved them.Didn't they love me?The woman in white pulled my leash, leading me back to the hallways of barking dogs that I remembered too well.I scraped my paws against the ground, whimpering in protest.The woman just honked frustrated at me and pulled harder.But then a man came over.He honked at the woman, and she stopped pulling me.He bent down and rubbed my head.I didn't know what to think.I licked his hand and he honked at the woman some more, until finally he took my leash and we walked out of the kennel together.I followed him, nervous, and he led me to a car.He opened the back door and ushered me in, but I didn't know what to do.What if he brought me back to the kennel again, just like Steve and Laura?The man honked at me and then did something that Steve and Laura never did: he opened the car passenger door and pointed.He wanted me to sit up front with him?Excited, I bounded in and started panting in the passenger seat.The man climbed inside and started the car.He honked at me some more, and between his strange mouth sounds, I think I figured out his name: oppositewerewolf.He gave me a treat.I already love him.*****
