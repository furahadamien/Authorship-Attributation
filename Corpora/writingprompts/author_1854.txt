One random day, all the 100's in the same room finally counted for something: a 20 came along.He wasn't handcuffed, he wasn't even being roughed by the guards, and they left his cell door open.We asked what he did and he answered that he was a chaotic evil Rogue that needed a party so he got caught.He got the attention of a guard, whispered something in his ear then the guard immediately bolted out of the room.An hour later we all had our pardons signed and we were now off to kill a necromancer or some shit, dunno I'm just collecting the free shit I get for following the guy around.
