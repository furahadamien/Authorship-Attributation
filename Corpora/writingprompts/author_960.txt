"Jim, wake up..."

"Huh?""It's Christmas.You don't want to miss the kids opening their presents, do you?"As she said it she gave me a small kiss before slipping off to the bathroom to get ready for the morning.I rolled over and looked at my phone.*Six thirty, the kids won't be awake for another hour.Maybe I'll get my present early.*

She came back wearing that black little number I bought her for our anniversary last month.Nobody thinks much of fall weddings but the hot cider and pumpkin pies really added a touch that you rarely see at weddings.Sarah looked at me with a coy smile and then walked back to bed, "Merry Christmas," she whispered.Twenty minutes later as I dressed for the inevitable morning festivities I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed.It has been a few years since I got promoted at work but the reality of financial stability still hasn't set in.This was the first Christmas that I swore to myself that no matter what happened, my kids would get everything they asked for this year.They wanted the usual things, money, new cell phones, all the things they knew we wouldn't normally buy them (and a few things that they knew we would.)But then I got to her list.Kristen turned fifteen this past March and even though she's becoming quite the young woman she still has her moments of childhood bliss.When I saw a pony at the end of her list my heart sank.I knew I wanted to get her everything on the list but the practicality of owning a pony was just not feasible.I told her that if she REALLY wanted the pony Santa would have to bring it to her.She laughed when she told me she was too old for "that stuff" but I told her it didn't matter what she thought she believed.She needed to trust that things would be made right.We sat down and she penned the letter with me and we mailed it out the next day.Now the morning was here and I knew she wouldn't be upset, but I was.I couldn't deliver.Downstairs the kids were slowly dragging themselves to the living room where we had the tree.It was a seven-foot Douglas Fir, lightly blue needles painted the floor around it as the rainbow lights lit up the years worth of memory ornaments.My favorites were always the cliched "Baby's First" ornaments with both Kristen and Dominic's faces embedded in them, Sarah always preferred the family ones.Sarah made us all coffee as I began handing out presents.When times were rougher we didn't really even get the opportunity to celebrate so now that things are finally turning around we cherish these moments together.Dom was off playing with his new G-Phone when it happened.It was the newest model with facial recognition and 3-D printing capability.He was off finding small trinkets and objects for the phone to capture when we heard a noise coming from the front yard.Honestly it sounded like a low rumble at first.It quickly progressed and turned into what sounded like footsteps.When Dominic pulled open the curtains over the front window in the house nobody could believe what they saw.It was Onyx black, and I don't mean that kind of black that middle aged moms dye their hair that looks purple in the sunlight, I mean to say that it was blacker than any living thing should ever be.We just thought it was the lights in the house casting a shadow at first but then it turned around and opened its eyes.I'm not even really sure how to describe the eyes of the beast that was standing before us.They were long, that's for sure and yet, they seemed to be on fire.Not just glowing red, like actual fire licking up the sides of its cheeks.Suddenly it reared back as if to say, "Look at me!"Before we could decide what to do with this large fiery mammal a note seemed to pop into existence.When I unread it I could hardly describe what I was reading.It was notes, instructions if you will.>This pet needs no food or water, EVER!>This pet is only on this plane of existence because I got a happy that someone finally wrote to me.>One rule, do not ride the rainbow trail.You'll understand when the time comes.We rushed out to see the magnificent beast first thing.Around its neck was the letter from my daughter.It had been delivered alright but instead of "Santa" she had written "Satan."As I watched Kristen fade into the distance as this "horse" flew toward the horizon I don't know whether or not I missed her typo or if she changed it before she sent it but however this chain of events came to pass, I know it is for the best.
