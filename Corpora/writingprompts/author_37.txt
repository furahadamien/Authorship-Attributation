November, 2017.A month right before everything went wrong.It all started out with that repeal of net neutrality.Almost immediately, the ISP's began to go back on their promises that they wouldn't limit access for customers.Within a few months, the ISP's managed to stratify the internet by wealth.Internet culture came to a screeching halt in early 2018 as numerous websites deemed as "high bandwidth content" began to go bland and die due to severe restrictions on their access by the general public.There was outrage, of course, but like with many things, the fury died down, and people accepted that this is the way the world was.Slowly but surely, more and more websites began to disappear from the web as their content became more and more restricted.The ISP's became all the more powerful, as they aggressively tried to buy out platforms like Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, and other social media to further advance their profit margins.The websites that resisted the buyouts were strangled to death with access restrictions.By the time Trump was impeached for the 9th and final time, the damage his negligence caused was irreversible.The ISP's had become all powerful.All information passed through them, and secretly, they were in the process of merging behind the scenes into one massive conglomerate ISP.When the federal government tried to break them up, the conglomerate ISP, eventually known as The Provider, shut down all government services.It was chaos.Since the Provider controlled the flow of all information, it was easy to paint the situation as a failure of governance.The Provider was more than happy to take the mantle as the New Government of the United States.The year is now 2038.If George Orwell could see the world we are living in, he would die of terror.Three years ago, the Provider mandated that all people have a chip installed in their brains.They were sold as a "virtualized access chips", but that was only on the surface.These were Death Chips.These chips knew the account balance of the people they were implanted in, and if that balance did not qualify for certain levels for information access on the Net, then higher brain function was reduced.These chips literally reduced the thinking capacity of those with low account balances, so much so to create a slave race of drone workers.If an unhappy soul reaches 0, well... brain death.A few of us escaped the implementation of the chips.For three years, we have been living off the grid in the wastes of Montana, fighting back against the Provider, although never with resounding success.That was until a couple weeks ago.A crazed old man who claims to be a scientists came to us about a year ago with this insane idea about time travel.He said he used to work for the Provider, in their research and development department.When he realized they were entrusting him to create a time machine for the purpose of rewritting history to suit their diabolical needs, he took all their research, and fled, making sure to purge all information relating to the project.We all thought he was crazy, but now it seems he was right.As we prepare to send our first agents back in time to sabatage the ISP's before they sprout their evil, I try to think of a world where digital information is free flowing and equal.As I step into 2017 to fulfill my assigned mission, I shed a single tear seeing how free and open the internet is.It must be protected.At all cost.
