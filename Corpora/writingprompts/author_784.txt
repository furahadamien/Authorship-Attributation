Matt was tired of his life.He was struggling to get a topic to research on.He was well known as the world's premier authority on Vampire studies, but that didn't satisfy him.He wanted to find the current whereabouts of vampires.Most of all, he wanted the answer to the greatest mystery related to vampires: their survival.Vampires were mystical creatures that were physically superior to humans, yet looked the same.They were also generally cleverer than humans.However, they needed human blood to survive, and so had never been able to take over the world.Their magical origins caused another weakness: Vampires were unable to enter houses uninvited.The 22nd century had been one of mistrust, and Matt couldn't think of a way that the vampires could have survived that time.Recently, many prominent leaders of the world had been killed in their sleep, and the vampires had come forward claiming responsibility for the attacks.The world had scoffed at this statement, believing that the vampires could not enter the homes.Yet Matt couldn't shake off the feeling that thr vampires were telling the truth.And so he puzzled over the method of entry, and did not question the fact that the vampires entered the homes.After months of research, Matt was very close to the answer.The killings of the leaders had continued, and the world was finally considering the possibility of the vampires being the murderers.Matt had been approached a week ago by various newspapers, who had questions on how the vampires had entered the house.Matt had studied each killing, and had concluded that there was no flaw in the security of the houses.As he went to sleep, the door bell rang.Matt was annoyed, but went to open the door.For security reasons, he had a dual door system, to ensure that he wasn't attacked the moment he opened the door.Matt watched the screen, and saw that his visitor was a well dressed man.As he operated the switch to close the main door, he noticed the welcome mat of his house.That was when a sudden thought hit him: What if welcome mats were a form of Invitation?If they were, the visitor could be a vampire.Matt switched on the infrared camera, and he could see that his visitor was not human.Suddenly, there was a thud on the door as the visitor reached the second door.Matt rushed to his bedroom, and turned on his laptop.He had to send this information to somebody before he was kidnapped or killed.As he began typing put the message, he heard the bedroom door crack open.The vampire entered in and spoke "Mr. Matt, I believe you have found out our technique to escape our weakness.You know, it was the grand vampire of my clan that popularised welcome mats.Now that I've told you this, I'm afraid I'm going to have to kill you.We believe that you are the greatest threat to us, and you proved us right today by guessing our secret.".With that, the vampire slit Matt's throat.As his eyes turned glassy, the vampire told him" Goodbye Matt."
