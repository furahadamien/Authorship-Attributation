Survivor Log - Day 41 Year 30 - A.A.If I should be so fortunate, I shall never lay eyes on another Oreo cookie.If you're reading this entry, you have no idea just what havoc an Oreo-centric diet does to a man's digestive tract.Their putrid sickly sweet chocolate smell haunts my dreams at night.They said lifetime supply, but they never explained just how many fucking Oreos they'd send each month.Im not entirely sure why marketing decided that two truckloads of oreos was an appropriate monthly amount.I was like a big, Oreo fan initially, but even I was like, two truckloads a month? I would have been fine with a couple of boxes...


And then these trucks just kept showing up monthly, each dropping off shipping containers - leaving em where I was staying.Of course the shipping containers, full of food, became a breeding ground for animals - especially raccoons.Nasty, oreo-diarrhea-fueled raccoons.Every single spot I settled just became a cornucopia of shipping containers, plastic packaging, and violent, shitting animals.You may think, wow!Its the apocalypse, and you have unlimited animals to eat.How great!Friend, have you ever eaten an animal that has survived off nothing but Oreo cookies?Their meat becomes dry and sticky.Upon first consumption, one begins to vomit immediately.So I kept moving.Which, by the way, is not easy to do.The world is like really fucking over.There are bands of dudes with weapons that just rove around killing people with these giant spikes.Not to mention flash floods of what can only be described as liquid fire.Im out of ideas at this point.Im pretty tired of moving.Everywhere I go, those oreos find me.Ive tried getting this to stop.But nobodys even driving those trucks.It doesnt make any sense.Anyways, thisll be my last entry.I fully expect to expire at the end of this year.The animals have been moving closer.I suspect they plan to eat me.I cannot blame them.Theyve had nothing but oreo cookies for months.My only hope, is that the oreo deliveries do not follow me into the afterlife.Be well,
