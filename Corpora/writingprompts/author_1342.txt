"I'm sorry."It sounded like such an empty phrase now.Poof!Then I'm beside her.Ten years of saying I'm sorry.What comfort could she take from that now?After ten years?Years of turning up to every papercut she got at work, to every jump scare she got while watching a scary movie with her latest in a long line of 'never-there' boyfriends."Don't."she says.It hurts, but she doesn't say it to hurt me.I can hear the tiredness in her voice.I turn to face her and see the sadness in her eyes."Just don't."She stresses the words.I hear a sob break from her throat."Not today.Please.Not today."I look deeper into her eyes and I know something's not right.This isn't like the other times.This isn't a break-up or a bad day.There's something more here, something... less.Less than her.It's as if a part of her has been swept away by a tide now distant.For a moment, I thought it was me.I had ruined her life - had ruined mine - with a teenage pledge.Now she had given up.I knew the feeling, I had thought to end it all before.I still loved her.How could I not.She never left me.No, I never left her.But those were just my selfish thoughts.This...This was something different."Laura?"I ask."What's wrong?What's happened?"Her eyes glisten with tears and I know she's been crying for hours.Her cheeks are blushed and bloated.It's a look I know all too well now.She just stares at me blankly.For a moment I see a faint smile grow from the corner of her mouth before it falls away and leaves a pained expression."It's my Dad."she says.The utterance of those words seems to wrench new pain from her chest and she grips it fervently."There was an accident at work.They...they said they tried to save him but-"

I close my arms about her and draw her in tight.Her head rests upon my shoulder and I feel her tears begin to soak my shirt."I'm sorry."I say but again those words seem so hollow."It's going to be ok." I try again and now the words have meaning.I rub her back and she begins to cry out loud."It's going to be ok.I'm here for you.I'll always be here for you."
