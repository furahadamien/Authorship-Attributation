#Blank 


Its been a while since Sally left John 

And even though he knows she's gone 

He still can't help but hang his head 

When he wakes up cold, alone in bed.Joe and earl, what's left of his world 

Two young boys, though he wanted a girl, 

Burst through the door and shout and scream 

Of what they'd seen on the TV screen 


"dad, dad, you have to hear!The biggest story of the year"

And from the living room he can hear 

words that fill him with dread and fear 


"Mugs tell truths" the headline reads 

"we can now say, from multiple leads 

And, yes, I swear, you are hearing this right, 

Number 1 dad mugs have changed overnight 


To tell the truth of how you rank 

No matter the money in your bank 

Or if in your last job your attitude stank 

(oh, and of course, non fathers' are blank)"


His heart in his mouth, the turns to his kids 

"There's something I must say" though never did 

For they ran to the kitchen though their dad 
screamed "no!"And pulled from the shelf the one mug they owned 


Scratching and rubbing, surprised and confused 

They scanned the china but hadn't a clue 

For the mug, all around, was stone cold white 

The boys frowned, upset, this couldn't be right.John, of course, played along 

"No worries" he stammered "it must just be made wrong"

But he knew the reason why the writing was gone 

For that was the reason why Sally left John.
