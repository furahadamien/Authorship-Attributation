I am nobody, 
No one at all."It's cold out" I thought, as the brim of my life was over flowing, seeping away."No" I breathed.But it came anyway...I woke up drenched in sweat, the uncomfortable sticky type that made your clothes stick to your skin.They clung to me like death."Hello!"a shrill voice rang out, "Can I help you?""No" I replied, accepting my fate, dismal as usual."I asked, how may I help you?!"She screeched again."No manners, they send me, no manners" her screeches had degraded to near squawks at this point."Oh right!"I exclaimed, "No, thank you" 

But... that... well, seem to set her off.A giant shadow began to loom over me, wings of an eagle seem to engulf me.Till, finally, I turned around.There a dark figure loomed standing menacingly in the fire temporarily blocking my vision.Electricity crept up my back as flight lightened my feet.But as my blindness faded so did my fear.Lo and behold the Cat-cardinal.A rather fluffy creature that can only be described as a G rated Griffin.She stood up menacingly on furry toe-beans of fury, her head majestically glimmering red in the fire.I couldn't contain my laughter of relief.This did not help my case, you see, for I seemed to had ruffled her feathers even more."And who are you?"She asked, in the best roar she could muster, a mix between a peep, squeak, and a mew.Her puffed up chest gleaming brightly in the flickering light."No one comes here"

I giggled a bit, I admit, but it was quite a sight to see.Until reality hit.I was no one.
