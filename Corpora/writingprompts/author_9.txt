Sometimes I hate my job.Simply hate it.At this point I've killed 36 time travelers, they keep coming, I keep killing.I often wish I could just let them finish their job, but at what cost?This was my reward for being the best.I get to do the worst.Each traveler I've killed has had the same idea.Go back, save millions; by killing the most wretched man in history.I would do the same, in fact I did.When I first invented the means to travel in time I had a grand time, I was rich, I had everything anyone could ever want.I had seen the most amazing things, but at some point the guilt of not using my invention for something better got the best of me.I went back in time, I killed Hitler.It was easy.I could pick any point in his life, even at the height of his power.Simply pop on by and shoot him in the head, strangle him in his sleep or the method I decided to go with: Help an assassin complete his job.It was easy as pie.I simply gave a few tips to a man named Nikolaus von Halem about Hitlers plans the coming week and two days later a man named Beppo Rmer shot and killed Hitler in the autumn of 1939.I joined a celebration in London that evening and met the woman who would later become my wife.I decided to stop time traveling and settled with my wife in London where we raised a son and daughter.Tensions had been rising between the Allies and the Soviet Union during this time, but it looked to me like the inevitable Cold War was starting as before, only this time without the deaths of tens of millions of people following the Second World War.Germany was split between the east and west and I was sure that while my actions hadn't radically changed history at least I had prevented mass killings, the atomic bomb had not been used on Japan who had capitulated shortly after fall of Germany once the Allied forced had changed their focus on them.Everything was going well until one day I heard the chilling sound of air raid sirens.My wife and I rushed our family to the nearest bomb shelter, but it was too late.I was knocked unconscious and woke up to a sight I had never imagined.Dust and rubble everywhere, fires, everything was dark and gray.My children and wife were dead.A building had fallen on them.I instantly knew what had happened.I did this.I changed history and now my family was dead.I used my old invention I had swore to never again touch.I tried hundreds of ways to stop the impending disaster, but no matter what I did I could not save my family, I could not stop nuclear war.Every path, every change led to the same result.A world without Hitler it seemed was a world where no one could live.I had tried for years to find a solution when I finally made the decision to save one of the worst people in history and kill 60 million others to save the rest of humanity.I went back in time, I intervened with Beppo Rmers plans so he was arrested.Hitler saved and history restored.I was in my late 40ies now, at least that's what I think.It's hard to tell the passing of time when you live outside it.I couldn't go back to my old life.My wife was in her early 20ies at this point, I was twice her age.I made the decision to go back to my own time, back to before my time travel antics during the mid 21st century.A simpler more linear time.What I intended to be my travel back to my old town however turned out to be something else entirely.I was in a dead forest.I was sure I had the right coordinates, but my town simply wasn't here.I traveled back to London to see what was going on, and all I saw was again rubble and ruins.The nuclear war had happened regardless.I had done something wrong or changed something else.So I traveled back to 1945 and to my surprise Hitler had not died recently, but in a mysterious assassination plot.Perhaps this was a butterfly effect of my previous actions, something I did made history change in some minor way and an assassination was successful.I went back to a day a few hours before his death which now was in 1937.It was in the middle of the night, in his bedroom.I stayed in the corner, silent and invisible and simply watched.Then something familiar happened.A time traveler popped into view.Exactly how my invention worked.He walked over to Hitler when I told him to stop.He turned around and I shot him.I returned to 1945 to again read up on Hitlers final end.This time I couldn't even find an article about it.After a ton of research I figured out a German soldier had died in 1916 during the battle of the Somme.Somehow my time travel technology was being used by others to go back in time and kill Hitler.This went on and on for years.Someone killed Hitler, I found out where, when and how and went back and saved him.Sometimes it was easy, sometimes it was hard.I once spent a whole year tracking him as a child when all I could find was the year of his death.Once he was slowly poisoned over a period of 3 years which was a really hard nut to crack.Eventually though, all plans to kill Hitler was stopped short and the traveler dealt with.History preserved and nuclear holocaust averted.Then one day when going back to 1945 to see how the war went I was surprised not only that the war hadn't happened, but that Hitler himself was alive and well.He was a painter!Not just a mediocre painter either, he was world famous.He had his own gallery in London and I visited him.He was a charming, welcoming man with a family and several children.His studio had a ton of paintings and his life was dedicated to his family and his work.He had never enlisted for the army, never had any fascist views, but he did tell me about his old mentor he met when he was 21.A man with amazing talent for painting who taught him how to perfect his art and be the best person he could be.This was something new to me.Rather than kill Hitler it seemed someone went back in time and set his life on a different path.Perhaps this would change things, perhaps this was the cosmic event that could both stop World War II and save the planet from Nuclear War!As it turns out however, that was not the case.A quick trip to the future proved as much.I went back to 1910, found Hitler and his mentor.I could not believe my eyes when I saw who it was!Bob Ross the famous painter from that old TV show I used to watch.Afro and all.I introduced myself to the two men.There was simply no way I was ever going to kill Bob Ross!I told my story about how I had been keeping Hitler alive.And to my surprise, Hitler himself wasn't phased by this at all.He told me he had been fighting off time travelers since he was a teenager.They usually bolt when he points a gun at them, but some had suffered worse.He had grown to hate the World for this and wanted revenge, until one day Bob came into his life and changed everything.He had come to realize that the path he was on would lead to ruin and horror and so his life was turned around.I finally told him about what would happen if he didn't follow his old destiny, about how the World would burn if he didn't do the horrible deeds he had originally done.I took them both to the future they created and showed them the destruction.It was Hitler himself that suggested the solution.Him, Bob and I would work together to bring Hitler to power, create The Third Reich and set it and themselves up for destruction in 1945.I would make sure no more time travelers tried their luck, Bob would make sure history was preserved, the right nations invaded, the key decisions made and Hitler would play his role of the most wretched man in history.-------
