The details may be different, but the general plot is always the same.A boy is born to parents who are loving, but don't really know how to raise him.On a surface level, he has everything a child could need, but he has no basis for his morals.From a young age he is indecisive and quiet.It is not until his early teen years that he starts to learn how to think for himself.Since his parents gave him none, he invents his own world view... well, not really.&nbsp;

We are his previous incarnations.We we all know how this boy's life will go because we've all lived it, and then re-lived it time and time again, here in this movie theater.&nbsp;

I don't know what form this place took before movie theaters existed, but every time we go into the lobby between lives, we come back and it's more modern.It now has the latest screen and sound technology.We sit down in the seats, newly engineered for maximum comfort, and watch the same depressing story happen again, just set 30 or so years farther in the future.&nbsp;

You see, that boy starts to think and think.Pretty soon he becomes reclusive and spends most of his time lying in bed, just thinking.In his endless hours of thinking, he starts to develop the idea, our idea.When one life ends, they pass the idea on to the next life, who, at around age 13, picks it up where the previous life left off and continues to develop it: our theory of society and life itself.&nbsp;

The theory doesn't often stay on the same path.While I haven't been here long enough to witness it myself, some of the older incarnations have told me of the cycle.The theory doesn't really progress, it instead goes through vicissitudes of nihilism and optimism, but the exact details are never the same.Perhaps it is progressing, in a roundabout way, towards... something.&nbsp;

The parents start to get worried and try to take the boy to a therapist, which doesn't help.By this point, the boy is so caught up in the theory that he can't bring himself to focus on anything else.&nbsp;

Eventually, the next phase of his life begins.At around age 20, the parents eventually force him to either go to college or get a job.He does, and he starts to make friends, actual friends, not like the ones he had in school.They're friends that he can trust, that he can talk to.The theory gets pushed to the back of his mind, but it's still there, and he begins to study his friends through the lens of his theory.He finds that they follow it exactly.Regardless of what point the theory is at.&nbsp;

For us spectators, this is the most painful part of a life.Things are finally starting to look up, but we know how it will turn out.Sometimes I wonder why we even bother watching.We could probably go to sleep, and waste away our non-existence in dreams of a better life.&nbsp;

Soon, one of the friends becomes more than a friend.They start going out together.They're both so infatuated with each other that the other friends start to fall by the wayside.They're still present in the boy's life, but there's always a certain distance between them.&nbsp;

At around age 25, the boy starts to think that maybe the theory was wrong.His lover seems to disprove it with their flamboyant passion.At this point, they've been together for 3 years and the boy thinks he understands them, understands how their mind functions.He thinks he can trust them.He decides to tell them about the theory.&nbsp;

I've always wondered if each incarnation's lover is a reincarnation of the same person, like us.Maybe after watching the event that followed time and time again, they would start to understand.&nbsp;

Of course, they don't  understand the theory at first.How could they?He tries and tries to explain, but they just don't get it.The lover writes it off and tries to pretend this didn't happen.He starts to think that he was wrong, they are just like all of the others.The boy, dejected at this lambasting of his life's work, breaks up with the lover.&nbsp;

At this point, the parents come back into the boy's life.They are tired of his inaction and want him to move on.He's been working this same low-level job for several years, even though most of his friends have moved on the better conditions.They force him to quit.He comes to live with them while he looks for a job.He then gets an idea: he'll become an author and write about his theory of society and life itself.&nbsp;

The parents chastise him for this foolish idea.They say that he just doesn't get it, that he needs to get a grip.They're oblivious to the fact that that will never happen.That's our problem: we're thinkers, not doers.Our fate is to forever wallow in our theory and our inaction.&nbsp;

But, at around age 29, for once in his life, after lying at home, enduring constant berating from his parents for 3 or 4 years, the boy decides to challenge his fate, he decides to take action.&nbsp;

He'll please his parents; he'll work to get a better job, but on the side, he'll start to write down his theory.He works hard.Not a moment is spent idle.His parents finally start to approve of what he's doing.&nbsp;

After a year of hard work, he sends his theory to a publisher.While waiting for a response, he manages to land an interview for a very prestigious job, but the day before the interview, he starts to get worried about the publisher's response and goes down to their office.&nbsp;

The receptionist at the publishing house looks up his name and finds nothing."I'm sorry," they say, "it seems that we haven't received anything from you.Are you sure you got the address right?"The boy is furious.He knows they got it; they must have, but they didn't like it, no, they didn't understand it.They couldn't comprehend his masterpiece so they deleted it.They pretended they never got it so they wouldn't have to tell him how bad it was.&nbsp;

That night, his anger turns to sadness, and sadness turns to self-hatred.He was so foolish, foolish to think that anyone else could understand the theory.&nbsp;

It's at this point that the boy usually sneaks out at night and commits suicide, leaving no note to his loved ones, but this current incarnation, does something different.Standing in the deserted park at the dead of night, holding a bottle of pills, he collapses to he knees."I can't do it..." he says, "I can't do it!"&nbsp;

He starts to think, maybe he was wrong, maybe his theory was never right to begin with.Perhaps there's something about us humans that can't be explained by any general rule.Perhaps we're not bound by fate to reenact the same scenario over and over.&nbsp;

"Yes!"I think, "You can do it!You can overcome your fate!"&nbsp;

But then he thinks of his old friends, and his former lover, and the publisher."No," he thinks, "If we're not bound by fate, then why did they all behave according to the theory?If the theory is wrong, then why do people usually follow it?This is too much for me.I don't understand; I can't understand."He swallows the pills.&nbsp;

And that is our fate.To become so caught up in our own ideas that we fail to live our lives.We never get to see how his loved ones react, but I'd imaging that they greet the news of his passing, not so much with grief, but pity."What a shame.It seemed that he was just about to do something with his life, that he was just about to finally start living."My one pleasure in watching this unfold over and over is to watch the theory, conceited as it is, develop.We've all contributed a small piece to it.None of us have ever escaped this fate, but this one had gotten my hopes up.For a brief moment, I thought that maybe he would be the one to reach the end of the theory, the conclusion.&nbsp;

We filter out into the lobby, and I see the boy I had just been watching on the screen, tears still in his eyes, looking confused.Inevitably someone will have to go over to him, and explain what's going on.I decide to go over.I tell him "It's okay.You got farther than any of the rest of us.You almost broke free."
