Empty office cubicles drowning in a dreary fluorescent hum sit in a square room.Lined up like an old used advent calendar with all the prizes and joy sucked out of them.In one particular cube an invitation and a stained mug sit near the edge of a desk like old friends would sit on a porch having a chat on a rainy afternoon.The invitation says, "In loving memory of Catherine.March 17th, 2016 - June 11th 2017".And all the tired mug can muster up is, "#1 Dad".
