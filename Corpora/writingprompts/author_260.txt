I once led men to greatness.Until our race became too powerful, and *they* came to cut us down.We designed weapons and ships, specifically engineered against the invaders, but it wasn't enough.In the end, the surface was ravaged, and only a few thousand survivors, those who had sought shelter underground, remained.For their own sake I have sealed all the paths to the surface, and all the paths between shelters, so that humanity may never again band together or become noticeable enough to provoke another attack.I sincerely hope that they will come to forgive me for this...It has been 200 years since the Great War.All the old tunnels are still sealed.Perhaps humanity has become content with their underground lives.Perhaps they have all perished, and I am the only one left, kept alive only through the energy I used to fight with.It does get so lonely on the surface.Perhaps one of the old genetic engineering facilities survived the war.I could use some company...It has been 1000 years since the Great War.My creations have been culling any humans they find on the surface, but recently they have been overpowered in combat.One of the humans has even stolen a mech from my men.None of my officers know how a lowly human can pull it off, but I know Spiral Power when I hear about it.I ought to keep an eye on this "Kamina" person.
