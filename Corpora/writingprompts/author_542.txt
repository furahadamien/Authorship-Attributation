Mine didn't change, it still said number 1 dad, I was happy about it, who wouldn't be ?I had read about the fuss in the papers and heard about dads trying to get their ranking up.some with success some without.The big search was on for number 1, a reward was on offer from several large media groups.We as a family wanted nothing to do with it so we all vowed to keep it a secret.Problems began when a friend dropped by, he asked what my rank was and I lied.Told him I didn't have a cup.It was the biggest lie a dad could tell these days.He was taking the whole thing seriously because he was down in the tens of millions but was also not well off so like everyone he was looking to find number 1 and get the reward.Trouble was it wasn't just the mugs, it was spreading to T shirts, bumper stickers, you had to be so careful not to be outed.We ended up moving away, to a remote place where we could be safe.We heard on the radio that the wars are spreading worldwide.We are safe...for now.
