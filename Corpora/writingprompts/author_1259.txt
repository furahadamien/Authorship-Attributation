As I read the words I was at first happy, then indignant, surely this violates the rules!But then I realized it would only be so if responses were not written.So I smiled at the wholesomeness of the small Christmas rebellion and joined in, in hopes of spreading that much more Christmas joy to the lovely people of Reddit.However, soon I was finished in the bathroom, and my story had to come to an end.Merry Christmas!
