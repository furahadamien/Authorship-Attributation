My eyes flitted over the crowd of people lining up.26, 30, 14 - gonna have to turn her away - 22, 8988, 21, 43.I slowly looked back towards the big number.That's an 8, followed by a 9 and two more eights.I took a few steps to the left.It's all one number.That... shouldn't be right.It couldn't be right.But i was never wrong before, and i don't know why i'd be wrong now."I'm going to have to I.D.you sir."The man smirked."I don't look *that* young, do I?""Sir, i'm going to have to insist."I had to see it.I was sure that his I.D.would hold some clue."How young do I look?Take a guess."I couldn't resist the urge as a smirk invaded my face."Dunno.17, 16, maybe 8988?"For a brief moment, the man looked at me in shock.Then he burst out laughing."You're a funny guy.I wanna buy you a drink, when does your shift end?"I looked towards the bar door as Leon - the other bouncer - stepped through."Now."We headed inside and sat down at the bar.I insisted that he just get me a beer.He had the hard stuff.We both sat silent for a few minutes."So I suppose you know i'm immortal, then.I won't ask how.What you're probably wondering is why someone as old as me is in a bar drinking his liver to death."I arched an eyebrow and looked at him."History repeats itself every few thousand years.On my first time I was in a bar like this.Tomorrow's special, y'know."He had a happy, yet tired look in his eyes."It's my birthday tomorrow."I smiled, but his face became frustrated.He took a large swig of his drink and, with a roll of his eyes, said "Oh, and the world's ending."
