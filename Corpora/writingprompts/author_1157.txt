AletheiaDusk
A shudder of raw energy flowed up my spine as I was handed the book of my life.Finally, I would have the chance to recall all the memories I had lost in the last years.Alzheimer's had stolen so much of my life away-- my memories, my family, my life's love.All I had left were snapshots of emotions associated with random things that bore no other meaning for me.When I saw dandelions flowing in the wind, I felt like sobbing.When I saw the color pink, joy would flood my heart.When I smelled freshly mowed grass, anxiety rushed through my body."Thank you so much" I smiled up at the body of light responsible for handing me my book.I say body of light for lack of better descriptive words.It was unlike anything I had seen before.No response was given to me as I took the book away and found a place to begin reading.I was immediately swept away into the intense emotions of my forgotten childhood and of family that had long fled from my memory.Parents who were happy to have finally gotten the child they had longed for.Those first years had been filled with so much bliss and the wonderful security of childhood.Then I reached the age where I entered school and reading about halfway through the first day of Kindergarten,  a strange line had been written in italics.*Go sit with little girl sitting all alone, turn to page 5798*

*Go sit with the large group of laughing kids, turn to page 2346*

Alarmed, I look up for guidance and see that I have been left alone.No one is left inside the room with me.Now I start to feel panicked.Which choice is the real memory?How do I find my life again?My gut instinct is to sit with the little girl alone so I follow that path hoping that this is the choice that I truly made.I learn the girl's name, Moira, and somewhere I feel a pang of recollection.*Well I must be on the right path*, I think to myself if I have feelings of remembrance.I go through this path and follow my instincts with each choice.This path leads me to a wonderful friendship with Moira that later leads to a life of loving her.We grow up together, go to high school dances, get married, and have gorgeous children, and then grandchildren all before my Alzheimer's takes it from me.Even then, Moira is still by my side taking care of me.Then I've realized I reached the end of this path in the book.The lifetime of love still bringing warmth into my being but something starts nagging at me.What if that isn't the real path that I took in life?So I open the book again and begin to read.This time making entirely different choices.I don't go to sit with Moira in this path and instead choose the table of laughing children.I make many new lifetime friends in this path that I hadn't made in the other.Through a series of choices, I do end up becoming friends with Moira again.This time there is more drama in our relationship but we do get to have a lifetime of loving each other.I spend many lifetimes reading my own book, choosing every path.Each one feels special to me.In each lifetime, in the end, there's Moira taking care of me, no matter what our lives held before my Alzheimer's takes over.In some paths, we live happily through our years, in some one of us leaves the other but she always comes back to me when I need it most.Eventually, I come to the last words of my book of life.I find myself clutching the book dismayed.I look up to find the body of light standing before me.>What's wrong, child?>I can't remember which life was real.How do I know which path was real?>Does it matter?They were all real and just as meaningful.They all brought you to the same place.
