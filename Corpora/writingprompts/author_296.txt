Summary: A psychotic unstable man stalks a women.Being a shape shifter, he is able to trap her into many different relationships, but all of them end in the same sort of way and she endures many crazy, dangerous misfortunes.She thinks she just has bad luck and is cursed to attract the crazies.Little does she know, it been the same psycho all along....I see her


And we connect 


But not for long.I always seem to mess it up


And it goes horribly wrong.She loved me


She loves me 


And she'll love me forever.I will not let her go.My whole life is about her.Whenever it's not working out


I shape


I shift


Into a different person.Sounds like fiction


But its been going on since the beginning of time.There are others like me


Shapeshifters,


You see,


She loved Michael;


(That's me).And Jude:
That's me too.She loved


Kurt


And Otis


I  was them and also


Jonas.She loved them all because


They were all me


In one shape or another


Though she didn't know this.I think I'm sick;


I'm too obsessed


But I can't help it.Today,


I'm Lucas


I'm blond-
About 6 feet tall.I followed her to the theater


And I just sit there and watch.Eventually, I work up the nerve to move closer


I throw her a line as she exits the building


And we start talking


There's an instant connection 


She just adores me, I know it.And so the cycle starts again.This time I really crossed the line


I was too clingy she said--


That she didn't have enough alone time.Maybe it's true, but...It's just because I love her so.I just...Didn't want her to be alone.Instead of leaving, I grabbed her soft hands and placed them in mine."I just can't bare it.Not again.Not this time."She looks at me with her green eyes wide."Grace, it's time I tell you."She was very confused but I hurried along."I'm not who you think I am-


Well, I am but not in the way you think I am,
I mean I-
How do I explain it?You've known me forever,


Don't you understand?Don't you remember 


Michael in 10th grade?Or Kurt from the bank?""Of course,"


She said,


She remembered them all.And with each name I listed


She became more appalled."I was Michael, and Jonas and Otis!Me.Them.Us..
All.The same person,
Grace,
Don't you see?"At this point she looked at me like I was crazy.'Grace, honey, listen to me!"I slowly began to move closer 

And suddenly she began to run.She flew out the door and down the apartment steps."Grace, let me explain,
I have to tell you the rest!"She started to disappear in the rain.I screamed after her but she was too fast for me.I chased her all the way to the cliff.It happened to be the same one 


Her and I, as Otis, had that picnic.I told her the story,hoping she'd take it as proof


But she just appeared more confused


And afraid.What could I say?Growing frantic, I drew closer.Shifting into Otis, I grabbed hold.She screamed and shook with fright.We struggled.I tried to hold her still but she pushed and pulled and wriggled out of my arms.Once free,


She stepped back, losing her balance


I tried to grab her arm


But she stumbled off the edge.I looked down and watched Grace, my precious...


Fall to her death.She bobbed up and down.I screamed but, no use.The waves swallowed her


And not being able to bare it, 


I jumped in after


Wanting to..Somehow
Miraculously save her.My eyes were blurry and the waves strong.My arms struggled to fight to stay above.This man in a boat grabbed me and tried to get me to come aboard.My body gave out, I went limp on the boat floor.But in my mind


I was chasing Grace, 


I kept chasing and chasing her.Even months later...


And then a year in this cursed mental ward,


I had nightmares of her screaming


But I like to daydream she is with me


And for once


We're content;


And for a surreal moment 


I am happy.I hear her giggle,


I close my eyes


And I drift.I don't know if it was shock or what


But ever since the accident


I lost the ability to shift.Or maybe I just lost my will to do it.Just not trying hard enough.Doesn't matter without Grace, anyways...



Then again, I could always shift during break and walk right out the ward.But no, I just couldn't bare the dating life again.No...I couldn't bare it!It's a wicked game!How could I even think of going on without her?GRACE!I'm screaming in my head and on this piece of paper,


Perhaps, aloud as well


Maybe they'll come shut me up and save me from myself.Just when things were finally working


I had to ruin it again


For good.Oh, Grace, why'd you have to run?Really, it wasn't me...


You're the one!It's your fault for being so beautiful 


For..


For..Leading me on.For loving me and throwing me out whenever it was convenient,

I'm not looney


And if I am


You're the one who drove me to 


This lunacy!What have you done!?Look what you've done to me!...

Oh, Gracie.I take it back,


I'm sorry.It's times like these I understand why



You ran from me.
