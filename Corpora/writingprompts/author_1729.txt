PART 1/2  


When we die, we stand before a jury of our own making.The person you were the most cruel to, the one you were nicest to, the one who was saved by your actions, and the one who died because of your choices.&#x200B;

Of course, I knew all this.Because I have already gone through it.Twice, in fact, when I wound up with a hung jury the first time.In the end, I was chosen to stay in Purgatory itself.I was too complicated of a case, apparently.Not because I am a deep and interesting person, but because I was just too dull for anyone from either jury to have formed a solid opinion about me.All that is behind me now.All you need to know is that I work in Purgatory, helping set people up with their juries and helping make sure that the jury's judgement is interpreted correctly and upheld as best possible.Sometimes the jury wants something that is not fair, or not possible, you see?Sometimes there is a hung jury, as there was with me, and we start over.My mediocrity, my lack of emotion for anyone or anything, and my total apathy towards life and even towards the afterlife has made me a perfect fit for that job.&#x200B;

Not so much for this one.&#x200B;

You see, I was murdered.Brutally and without compassion.And now that my murderer is deceased, I have been selected from among his many victims to represent those who died due to his choices.&#x200B;

Walking into the main court building, I feel a sense of nostalgia.I have not set foot outside of the Purgatory offices in decades.I suppose that the building is always the same.Or maybe every few centuries it is updated.The gleaming lights feel more like an airport than like a courtroom *or* the afterlife.And they are so bright after working for so long in the near darkness of the filing rooms and my office.I haven't slept the whole time.I do not need to.&#x200B;

Taking my seat in the chair marked with our symbol for "dead", I see that the other three have not yet arrived.I take my time to look at the man before me.He is much older than I remember.I open the case file they have given me for him.Sometimes the person who was killed needs a bit of a refresher.I moreso than most, seeing as I never knew him.&#x200B;

You see, I worked at a grocery store checkout.I'd seen my fair share of crime, from petty theft to being held at gunpoint, from assaults to people shooting up in the staff-only bathroom.If only he had been so common, perhaps I wouldn't even need to read this file.But no, he had just walked in one day, drawn a knife, and put it right between my ribs.I died virtually instantly.And all these years, all these decades, I never thought to wonder why.&#x200B;

His file seems like more of a sob story than anything else.Had mine read like this?Did the files on the other seats have the same story?Or was this supposed to draw some sympathy out of me?&#x200B;

*Travis Simmons.Born 1933.Died 2018.*

&#x200B;

*Born to a couple who were father and daughter, the latter being underage, from a long line of incest, Travis had countless defects from birth.The most severe of which being hydrocephaly.The cult he was born into did not want their existence nor their incestuous ways to be revealed, so they simply condemned him as bearing the mark of Satan.For this his mother was executed, a fact which would only come to light fifteen years later, when the compound was discovered and raided.Raised by his father/grandfather, Travis was considered to be slow, but they never knew the physical or mental extent of his suffering.With no schooling and no medical tests, many perfectly reversible (even in the 70s and 80s) conditions he suffered from were allowed to develop into worse and worse iterations.At one point the symptoms became so severe that his father manually castrated him, to prevent him from reproducing, and set him to live with the barn animals.*

&#x200B;

*It was only in 1948 that he was discovered during the raid.He had no capacity for speech, and his carers throughout countless institutions could not determine if he had ever been able to speak in the first place.He was diagnosed with countless mental illnesses, but the most important of which, PTSD, was missed for too long.Eventually, as he seemed like a peaceful soul without a personality or identity, he was integrated into the community alongside a team of carers in 1985.It was shortly after this that he escaped their care, killing one of them and damaging several others in the process.You were one of many casualties of this one, lone rampage he went on before he was recaptured and returned to an institution, where he lived out the rest of his days in relative peace.*

&#x200B;

It was a short file, but it seemed it had to be.Looking at the attached medical records, it was clear that Travis here had barely been born with a brain at all, much less a capacity for rebellion.His one rampage was a fluke of sorts.And they were relying on his upbringing to persuade me he was not wholly bad deep down.&#x200B;

Curious, I reached over into the seat of the chair marked "life".Only for my hand to meet the plush fabric of the seat.Looking down and across, I saw that the other files were absent.I looked down at Travis, who looked up at me with nearly vacant eyes, shaking, scared by his own confusion, his face a mass of wrinkles and scars.In those nearly endless folds, I began to make out the face of the man who had murdered me for no reason, for no purpose.The face of a brutal killer, whatever the higher ups wanted to tell me.&#x200B;

The lights dimmed.&#x200B;

"Judgement shall commence," boomed The Voice.&#x200B;

"Wait, wait!"I exclaimed."Hold up, the others aren't here yet!"&#x200B;

"There are no others," The Voice said.&#x200B;

"But...He affected nobody so as to save their lives?"I asked.&#x200B;

"He did not," The Voice replied."He took countless lives, yours most directly, but he saved nobody."&#x200B;

"Very well, then one of those lives should be the person he was most cruel to?"I press.&#x200B;

"No, he was never cruel.He does not have the capacity for cruelty," The Voice replied."Nor has he the capacity for kindness.Nor premeditation.Nor love or hate.He feels nothing but the most basic of instincts."&#x200B;

I froze in the spot.I had not expected this.But I had to trust The Voice, the only arbiter present who knew all there was to know about the defendant.I looked down at Travis, who seemed either oblivious to the booming Voice and the argument taking place, or lost in his own nearly animalistic mind."So what am I expected to do?"
