They say curiosity killed the cat.It's a saying designed to keep people from doing dangerous things and finding more than they bargained for.It's totally inapplicable to humans.Curiosity kills cats because cats are stupid animals and can't do anything with what they learn, so the risk is for nothing.Intelligent curiosity is the reason humanity rules the world and not tigers.Rather a painful truth than wilful ignorance, I say.And, judging by my most recent, heh, discovery, what I've always said."Professor Scintillation Caught!"proclaims the newspaper.I run my fingers lovingly over the photo adorning the front page.I like the costume.I would, naturally, but it bears saying.It's a good costume.A lab coat that looks white from a distance but when you get close the light reflects out into a rainbow.I always did like showing people the light, heh heh.Probably the only thing I did like back in those days.I was a very angry young man.All "Those fools at the academy!"this, and "You'll see my true brilliance!"that, and so on.What a waste.Ten years and all I did was hurt people to try and be relevant.I mean, it was a good run.Most supervillains only last a few weeks before they get shot by the police.Turns out, most people are vulnerable to bullets.Who would have thought?Heh heh heh.Still, I really wasn't getting anywhere.I was surviving, and people knew who I was (or rather my nom de guerre, but semantics), but I wasn't really accomplishing anything.Youth is wasted on the young.That's another saying that I have issues with.Our strongest years are spent teaching us how to accomplish things and since we're strong we can recover from our mistakes faster.I was young, I learned a variety of ways to accomplish things, and now that I'm older and not quite as much of an idiot I can start putting them into practice.Suppose I have to thank Wipeout for that.I can admit, with the benefit of years as a, heh, model citizen, that I was in a rut.He forced me out of my comfort zone and gave me time to learn without being distracted by my, in retrospect, pathetic need for attention.Still, wouldn't do for my second wind to get ruined by another wipe, especially now that he's the only other person who has any memories of how my light technology works.Heh heh.Thanks, Wipeout.I'll be sure to write you a very touching eulogy after I kill the parasites afflicting our society.Heh heh heh.
