"Stand down, villain!"The battlecry broke off with a shrill note as Peacekeeper hobbled into the bank, wheezing at the effort he'd expended getting up the stairs.He paused to catch his breath at the door and leaned heavily upon the frame.Peacekeeper was clad in his signature blue and red unitard, unfortunately worn backwards, so his cape formed a sad looking bib.Blood Harpy, legendary villain and thief, was choking a security guard with one hand.With the other, she was rubbing her forehead in an attempt to remove the headache that had begun to build at Peacekeeper's entrance."George, you can't keep doing this, you know the excitement isn't good for your heart.""And you-" Peacekeeper coughed violently, then spoke amid heavy gasps."Can't.Keep.Robbing.Banks."With that, Peacekeeper slumped to the ground.Harpy's reaction was instant.She dropped the guard (who let out a heavy gasp) and sprinted towards the downed hero.Harpy checked for a pulse before putting her ear to the hero's chest."Stop fussing," muttered Peacekeeper, his breath shallow."Just need to take my medication.It's in my front pocket, can't seem to find it though..."

Harpy reached behind the elderly hero and produced a small brown bottle.Upon consuming a couple of pills, Peacekeeper's breathing returned to normal and Harpy's concern began to fade, just enough for her to get angry."I can't believe they let you through the cordon!"she said."What the hell were they thinking!You're what, 80 now?You can barely get up the damned stairs!""87" replied Peacekeeper, "and still young enough to teach you a lesson.""Tough talk" scoffed Harpy."For a hero who can't even keep track of his heart medication."Peacekeeper sighed, then spoke in a low voice."Listen Jess, I like one-liners as much as the next hero, but I've known you long enough to sense when something's wrong.You've been clean for years, and all of a sudden I hear that you're lifting from a bank?You're lashing out."Blood Harpy averted her gaze, and in doing so took in the scene around her.Trembling tellers, pale patrons and unconscious guards littered the bank.For the first time since her arrival, she realised that she was causing a scene.Harpy helped Peacekeeper to his feet, supported him with an arm, then turned to address her captive audience."Good news terrified mob, looks like you all get to live.Let it be known that I've captured the Peacekeeper and will execute him if I hear a single pig's trotter touch the floor of this bank.Now get the fuck out of my sight."As unsure civilians fled out their respective closest exits, Blood Harpy and The Peacekeeper made their way to the back of the bank.Harpy picked a secluded office, settled the elderly hero in one of the seats and closed all the blinds.George waited patiently for Harpy to seat herself before speaking."So are you going to tell me what this is all about?"he asked.Harpy thought about killing her nemesis there and then, it would be so much easier than the alternative.He'd been a thorn in her side for decades, always in the foreground, always putting a wrench in her plans, always in that damned unitard.Always there.Jess let out a heavy sigh, and wrung her hands together."Sarah's dead," she whispered.*to be continued?*
