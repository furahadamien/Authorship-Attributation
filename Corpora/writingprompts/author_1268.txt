The cracked phone glows brightly in front of me, an open text box in front of my aching eyes."Holidays, huh."I realize that I could write some grimdark horror, or some Christmas themed action ripoff.But what does that get me?Some advice on grammar?A few upvotes?Worthless.For once why don't I say something useful.Take a look around you.What do you see?Family?A computer screen?Bottles of booze?I see a room too small for two people, with a bed that begs for them.I see clothes lying wrinkled and dirty, because who do I have to impress?Parents?Disowned them.Family?Too far away to be cheap enough to see.I see in the mirror a mess of a person more monster than man, by his own making.A real life Beast: too violent and atypical to interact with society, but too lonely to stand the isolation.But do you know what else I see in that mirror?I see someone who wants nothing more than to find someone to be better for.I see someone who has stood by his friends, supporting them through two literal floods, suffering when he could have guaranteed himself a safe place somewhere else.I see someone unafraid to find someone to love after years of watching his heart break piece by piece.There are many people in the world.All with their ups and downs.There are those blinded by their positives to the point of arrogance, and those choked by their faults to the point of suicide.So to those out there staring at this, with no one by your side, I ask you to remember something: YOU are the change in your life.No one is coming to save you.Only you can do that.But without you, you will do nothing but wallow in despair.Now I don't know about you guys, But the future looks like it's got some good stuff over there.Who's coming with me?
