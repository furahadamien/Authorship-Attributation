backwards4
Air flooded into my lungs and my heart tick-tocked against the cage in my chest.There was someone in the house.The wind outside had seemed to move slightly different for a moment, gravel on the overgrown path displaced by the careless stomp of a shoe that knows where to go.I had told myself that of course there wouldn't be anyone; Mom didn't like to be home much anymore.Not now when she had a choice about it.But the clunk of a lock and the screech of a front door that never gets used because the only key walked out that archway ten years ago lets me know that I've got trouble coming.He's back.The lighter clicks and a lonely star burns orange through the gloom of the entrance hall."I've got the cigarettes Jacob"
My hair floats from a breeze, the only aspect of me free to move.I know I should run, the door through from the kitchen free, then I would be free, through the garden, through to the woods.Away.But I stay still.It's all I can do.And I wait.The scuffle of a footstep against wood.He must know where to look, and I see my terror outlined in a small orange circle as it makes its way closer.I sold my soul for this shit, and he still managed to crawl his way back to me, to us.It's been ten years but I still feel the wet slither of those words breathed down my neck, promising to make him leave, that he wouldn't hurt us both anymore again.That just one thing would be needed in return.And how could I say no to something like that?"Don't hide from me son, you know how I hate that.I said to be ready in a half hour, so you better be goddamnit" 
Another step against the floor, and outside the wind seems to howl at me, rising up in protest in a way that I seem unable to do, the trees whipped into a chaotic frenzy, the leaves churning through the evening air.Or is it just my heartbeat roaring in my ears?Another step, and this time it's mine, hard and sure against the unforgiving wood.My hands curl.Darkness clouds my vision, back tenses.I was already going to hell.Might as well make sure the promise of the are kept.He won't hurt us again.
