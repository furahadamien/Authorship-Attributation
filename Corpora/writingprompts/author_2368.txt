Julian limped up the steps to the house and took out his keys to unlock the door."Heeeeey... anyone home?It's me, don't shoot, okay?"he called out into the hallway.The lights were switched off but the living room was illuminated with flashing colors from the TV."I..." Julian started but his female host tut-tutted him.'Nope.No.Ssssssssshhhhhhhhh- no spoilers,' Sam waved her gamecube controller in the air.She sat cross-legged on a leather sofa, her shoulder showed as one sleeve of her oversized hoodie drooped to one side.Her hair was tied back sloppily with more than a few strands of hair dangling from the top.Bits of chips littered on the coffee table and a two opened cans of mountain dew stood precariously at the edge of the table."... Zelda's Twilight Princess had better graphics."'Another word and I will cut you," Sam said abruptly."Sam!I just stepped through your home, sweaty, dirty, bleeding... and look," Julian pointed to his scabbed knee."I think I got some wounds on my back too when I fell from the plane."Sam tapped the 'X' button vigorously, fighting for her life."...Ok, it's a car.I fell from a car while it was speeding through the highway."The TV beep-beep-beeped as Sam dodged the enemy's attack.Her toon-styled hero only has two and a half hearts left."Ok, so maybe the car wasn't moving that quickly," Julian corrected himself, nudging the sofa for Sam's attention."Come on, you're immortal, you have all the time in the world to play this.Put it on pause!"Sam threw down the controller and cheered 'YES!TAKE THAT, YOU CREEP!'as her toon hero raised the game's reward triumphantly above his head.She turned around and examined Julian while he stood with an awkward smile.'You look like you fell into a dumpster behind Pizza Hut and nearly got trashed by the trash compactor.'"I... How did you..." Julian stuttered."Wait a minute...I told you that, didn't I?"'Maybe,' Sam sighed as she stood up from the couch, stretching her cramped up legs.'But, you do have banana peel in your back pocket.'Julian grimaced as he pulled out the banana peel.'You have been coming through here a lot,' she continued as she walk into the kitchen."Have I?"he called back to her while settling down onto the sofa.That wound in the back sure is getting more painful than before.He heard the fridge open and closed, and Sam walked out noisily as she shuffled her feet lazily.'This is the fifth time this week.Once on Tuesday, three times yesterday.'"What happened on Tuesday?"'You showed off your new stabilizing core.'"Well, that'd be around 2 years ago for me."'Take off your jeans,' Sam said, gesturing with her hand."What?!N-no!What do you even need-"

Sam threw a tea towel onto the young time traveller's face.'You can cover whatever decency you have with that towel.I can't fix your wounds if you're wearing...that.Why do you even wear tight fit jeans?When are you from?'"2008... what is the first aid kit doing in the fridge in the first place?Hey, wait, ow!"Julian yelped when Sam knelt down on his foot.'Just bear with it.You always fidget when I'm disinfecting your wounds.'"It hurts, okay?It feels uuurrggghhh" Julian trembled with pain.He watched Sam skillfully treat his scabbed knee."Whoa, you're really good at this,' he said, unable to withstand the silence in the room.'Once you live long enough, you get good at things... would have been nice to not need to be good at this though,' she gestured for him to turn around and lie on his stomach.Just as he did so, the front door unlocked and a familiar voice rang through the hallway."Saaaaaaaaaam?It's me, don't shoot, okay?"Both Julian and Sam groaned."Don't let me see me-" Julian began but Sam had already walked to the hallway.He could hear her speaking loudly to the new visitor, 'Don't say anything.It's not an appropriate time now.Just write it down...'

And then the door slammed shut.Sam swept the chips off the table and set a package down."Did you lose your stabilizing core?""Yes!"Julian exclaimed, almost sitting up and Sam pushed him back down."It was on my writing desk last night and it was gone in the morning!I thought that maybe I could just go back slightly to check where I had left the core, but I guess I went a little too far back?"'You should know better to not time travel without a stabilizing core,' Sam chided as she pulled up Julian's t-shirt.The young man's voice muffled behind the shirt and he wriggled until it was out of his way."I thought that if it's just a couple of hours back, I could do it easily, with determination and focus."'You thought wrong and you have the worst focus ever.'"Hey, I am very focu- is that my stabilizing core?Is that why you knew I lost it?'he reached for the package but Sam slapped his hand down.'Listen, the wound on your back looks like a bullet grazed you.What did you do?'"Huh, nothing in particular?Oh, I was wondering why there was this random firework and then there was sharp pain on my back.I tripped over a rock, fell down the slope-"

'- and into the dumpster behind Pizza Hut,' Sam completed the story.'Alright, I'm done patching you up.It's not too serious, but change the bandage every day until it's not bleeding and oozing anymore.'She helped Julian up and gave him his jeans.Sam opened the package and handed a small hexagonal-shaped device to Julian."Thanks for, you know, treating my wounds and giving back my core," Julian said as they walked to the front door.'I can't tell you much, Julian, but it's obvious you'll be dealing with something dangerous at some point in time,' Sam said as she combed through her hair with her hand."Ugh, I'm already dreading it.I'm not good at this adventure thing," Julian shook his head worryingly.Sam pat the unharmed side of his back.'I complain every time you're here, but if you need help, you know where to find me.'"I know."The led lights in the device blinked, booting itself up for the journey.'I decided to play Wind Waker because I was nostalgic.It's better than Twilight Princess,' Sam said as they waited for the device to be ready."Oh yeah?And why were you nostalgic?"It's their own guessing game that Julian is fully familiar with by now.The device glowed blue on standby.'It's because I just completed Skyward Sword, 2 days after launch date, on Tuesday.'"Uh huh, I'll look out for its launch," Julian nodded his head, as if to make a mental note.The device beeped one more time and glowed green.Julian opened the door and stepped out of the house.He gave a small nod to bid farewell and Sam returned it with a smile.As the door closed, Sam added on quickly, 'You're gonna be so disappointed with Skyward Sword.'Her smile broadened as Julian shouted, "OH, I THOUGHT WE AGREED NO SPOIL-"

The door clicked shut and the time traveller was gone.
