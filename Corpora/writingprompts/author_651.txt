We all should have seen it coming.Something warned about since the beginning of the Bible.Yet who could turn down immortality?There were still the odd ones who did but most of them were considered nutcases.I suppose we all were too pleased with our achievements that we never imagined where it would lead us.I flicked through the last few pages not much left.To think even Tolkien couldnt have written such a strange world.We had gone from the pinnacle of human achievement, beating even death, to now to a dystopia where human life has almost no value.What was left?I thought a few times of ending my own life or just coming out of hiding and letting them do what they want with me.I opened the cottage door and set off to look for more fire wood.My age was definitely catching up with me.I used to be able to zip through these woods straight down to the lake on our family trips, still have the scar from that misstep I took into that Willow.Never knew how valuable the time spent here would be until us Lost Generation were forced into hiding.I bent over to pick up some broken branches, what I would have given to have gone to a retirement village like the ones when I was young.WHAT THE HELL!ITS AN OLD GUY! his voice shot through the trees.Shit, what a time to get a creek in the back.I tried my best to power walk away but I knew it was hopeless.Well, well one of them still wondering around.Wheres your stash old man? the burly red head said while his two friends held me up.I have nothing youll want, just books and tattered clothes I knew they didnt care, they were probably as desperate as everyone else.You must have some food, so hurry up and show us where you stashed it.In my day we had respect for our elders and looked after them, that what it meant to be civilised. I said as I began walking towards the cottage.No use in wasting my time arguing, theyd beat it out of me one way or another.You know that time is long past, its a dog eat dog world now. He twirled the switchblade between his fingers while Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb followed close behind.So how bad has it gotten?Its been over a year since I went into hiding. my curiosity got the better of me.No much different really, just less food and more people.Every now and then a turf wars break out, thats what drove my boys and I here.No one is really in control anymore, like I said dog eat dog. As he spoke I could picture it all happening again.When it was announced that we had found the cure for aging, cheers could be heard around the world.Man was master of all, nothing seemed out of his reach.Then came the news that only those under 26 could be treated, it seemed that the treatment required growth still to be occurring in the brain which tended to stop around 25 years old.Test on mice showed that ignoring this limit created bodies that never aged by brains wasted away, no one wanted that zombie apocalypse.Still it was a good deal, our kids were going to have amazing lives free from disease and physical ailments.The discovery was truly amazing!Even cell damage could continuously be repaired allowing for full limb or organ regrowth given enough time and care.Of course, there were those crying out against the treatments, saying man was playing God and stories of mutations of the trail patients but they were swept aside.Soon everyone eligible was being treated; it was a human right, the right to life.Then just by one the change in one question the world began to spiral out of control.What are you going to do with your life?Many a boy and girl would ponder this question as they grew and even as adults we were fixed on find our answer.When you have external life, the question loses all its meaning.You could do anything and everything, there was no time limit, no reaper awaiting you.Freedom without limit, yet no responsibility.Lacking a finite end life presented no urgency, no finality to choices, no higher meaning.Young adults put off all the things theyd usually feel pressured to do to enjoy life.University attendance dropped while the clubs filled up.Kids were drowning in all the drugs and alcohol that could get their hands on.Teen pregnancy was on the rise while miscarriages and abortions fell.Babies from these new parents were conceived with the Cure already in their DNA.The Lost Generation were forced to work past their retirement as few of the Cured Generation had pursued further education and careers.There was too much life to live to think about those things now.And with fewer and fewer deaths the world became overpopulated with those who were too busy enjoying life to make a difference.What followed was a collapse in the social fabric that held us all together.As the Lost Generation began to die off there was only a handful of the Cured Generation willing to take their place.Years of just getting by and the constant need for the next dopamine rush drove most to taking menial jobs for very low pay.As the standard of living dropped, crime and public unrest increased.Finally the ever growing lower class lashed out at the government and rich, looting and pillaging wherever they went.Leaders arose amongst them blaming the lack of food and amenities on the privileged educated few and called for the class systems to be torn down so they could rebuild it into their own utopia.It was clear there was no remnant of a government left, rather pockets of new factions that struggled against each other for power.The Lost Generation became easy targets and soon they all were either in hiding or dead.We rounded the last few trees and entered the small clearing.Woah, its completely overgrown.Would notice it just walking by, said the Red head.There was no way of telling exactly how old he was, could be just turning 20 or could be nearing his 70th birthday.All I knew was that he and I were from completely different worlds.Alright then, how do you get in? he pointed the switch blade at me smirking.The cottage was surrounded by bushes and trees and covered in moss.My dad had been an avid hunter and when I was young hed take the family out to the cottage each year for hunting season.Since hed died none of my family had come back, we knew the cottage as his true home and the memories of time spent there had always been too sacred to desecrate by going there without him.It seemed fitting to me that the cottage had been overgrown, almost entombed by nature itself.Soon it was likely to become my tomb as well.I pulled away the ivy over the door and pushed it open.With the windows covered there was barely any light in the cottage.Okay boys lets see what we have here. As they slide into the cottage, he turned to face me, and no funny stuff, go stand in that corner while we take a look around. I was mentioned into the darkest corner of the room.Watching what little I had been thrown around carelessly, I began to realise what a pathetic situation we were all in.Here I was, old and grey begin held up for the scraps of my life by those who had been given the promise of a truly boundless life.All that was left for me was death and yet I felt like the lucky one.The three I saw before me were, I realised, the real Lost Generation, unable to find meaning in their lives as they had no way to grasp how precious it was.I came to understand the fateful passage: *And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.* This was not Gods punishment but God kindness.Without knowing the limits of flesh we would never seek Him and in so doing seek to know ourselves and the purpose of our lives.We are just left striving to feed the flesh in a never ending destructive cycle.What do we have here, isnt this pretty? I could just make out the small glimmer of gold.And who is she? he asked smugly as he gab the blade into the locket to take the picture out.Anger instantly began boiling through me, I clutched tightly on the dusty coat next to me.It wasnt a coat rack holding this coat up, it was my fathers old hunting rifle.I gripped it tight and pulled it closer.She was a pretty one, Ill give you that.Too bad she wasnt our generation, then we could have had some fun with her too. One deep breathe in I ripped the coat off and before they realised what happened, a loud bang and the first of his friends was on the floor.Holy shi! The second round went off and his was left standing there clutching her locket.OKAY ILL LEAVE, LET ME TAKE THEM AND ILL LEAVE AND NEVER COME BACK he pleaded.Tears were rolling down my face, she had been my lifes purpose.Together we had gone through it all and still held each others hands right till the end.Though times had been rough my memories of her were of all the warmth and joy her life brought to those around her.She knew the value of life and made sure hers will lived to the full.I pull back the slide, rifle pointed straight at him.Hes not even fit to know her name.Tick.Oh youre gonna die now! he jeered as he pounced at me.I hit the slide with my hand trying to clear the jam but before I could look again he was right in front of me.Instinct kicked in and I immediately spun the butt of the gun into the side of his face then jabbed it into his nose.He stumbled back, disorientated.I had my chance!Time slowed down to a crawl as I felt the recoil of the rifle against my shoulder.He slunk back slightly then stopped for what felt like a minute.I could feel each breathe I took, deep and concentrated, not a single ounce of focus wasted.As he fell to the floor I felt the weight on my shoulders, the sudden realisation of how crazy this whole fight had been.I lowered the rifle and time began to speed back up.I slowly moved towards him body and reach out to pick up the locket.Suddenly I felt it, a sharp shooting pain in my side.As I lifted the locket my left hand clutched my side.The blood was now soaking through my clothes.I opened the locket, her picture was torn and tattered but too me she looked as perfect as ever.I made my way over to the easy chair and sat down slow.Well I guess theres only one thing left.As I find my place again a smile comes across my face for the last time.*End?No, the journey doesn't end here.Death is just another path, one that we all must take.The grey rain\-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it.*
