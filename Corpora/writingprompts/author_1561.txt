They had forgot their own history, he thought.It was not long ago that man first evolved on this rock.But they, and every creature like them bred, and multiplied, and multiplied.Some would die when they fell, drowned, starved or were eaten by something bigger.But they would never just , die.The mammalian body is capable of infinite self regeneration.It was evolutions marvel, its masterpiece.Cells could divide, replace old ones and regenerate all but the most severe of trauma's.As long as the creature ate and drank, the process could go on forever.This of course had all happened before.Another lifeform, the tree had grown an indigestible bark which no microorganism could metabolize.Dead forests littered the earth, were buried, turned to coal in time but then something discovered a weakness, a chink in the hard armor, just as he had found a way now.A fungi had overcame the problem and oh, did it feast for decades.Spreading into every non subterranean dead forest like a swarm.When you are the only thing that can eat a helpless prey, the lack of competition invites you to grow ever more greedy.And he was hungry.And so the same had came to pass for humans.Their number had spiralled out of control, they were hunting the planet to extinction to feed their own immortality.Until the infection of death came, a bi product of their powerful life force, echoing out into the cosmos, through means they could not comprehend.A beacon for the dark, inviting it in.Death was a virus, but not a regular virus.It had permeated space, time and multiplied to fill the void between stars.Its own sentience grew from its vastness.Like colonies of bacteria who show a greater intelligence than their constituent parts, death had once been a small thing, a footnote of the universe.But it had always fed, and it had always made more of itself.Only its methods had changed as it found new types of life, and new ways to make more of itself.It was ethereal, invisible but, it was there.To fuel its own propagation, the death strain needed hosts, just like any other virus, ones it could co-opt to perform its own tasks.So it slipped inside every living organism as it spread to a new part of the galaxy, and discovered how it worked.Some alien life stole energy from their fat, inflated blue giant stars, becoming monstrous and large, living in the clouds of the super Jupiter class planets.Death could syphon these, deflating them slowly like a balloon , taking that converted energy to make more of himself.Larger and smarter with a brain that permeates between the stars themselves.Humans were a rare find.Energy converter organisms which predated other life to fuel a type of cell division.Those cells could make more of death at a faster pace than any other encountered life so far.What unique creatures.A new field to grow and harvest and reap.If he had a mouth, it would be salivating at the mere thought of understanding how to take of this ripe crop.As death infected the first humans he propagated inside them and discovered they were bi gender, male and female, completely different on the inside.He would be able to infect them before they were even born for every female he inhabited.He made their first cells replicate for him.What a mistake this was , every cell atrophied in seconds as the burden of producing so many took its toll .It was horrific to watch for their children as their mother grew aged , crooked and silver haired.That silver hair, no other human had ever became old, they did not know what was happening only that their parents were in terrible agony.They did not know they were fuelling a being larger and more terrible than their tiny brains could ever fantasize of its existence.As their parents withered and died in seconds, death understood how this new, powerful process worked.He could spread himself thin.Infect every living human, and every new human growing in the womb.He could slowly sap their cell function and he estimated that none would survive this beyond 120 years due to shortening of vital telomere's, which protected their immortal DNA.Every ethereal death cell caused these to wear down.The impact of this would affect humans differently and many would not survive harsh environments with which once they could exist in easily.The world had become a darker, more dangerous place for the humans.That was the plan, but he found he could not stick to it.The rate these humans were making more of him, it was insatiable and had awoken something even darker within himself, a lust for more and more.He decimated the population, rapidly aging every human he could encounter.In mere minutes the human race went nearly extinct.And death did something he has not done since, moving most of his physical being to encase the planet.The sheer concentration of his cells destroyed the biosphere and upset natures delicate balance, plunging it into an eternal cold age of ice.What humans did survive the reaping were faced with a bleak, frozen landscape.Thousands more died from exposure.This pained death greatly.What missed opportunity.So much more of death could now no longer be created.This must stop.He had to regain control of himself.He stuck to the plan.And so it was that every human slowly died.But none could remember a time when they did not.Stories of ancient humans grew into mere myth, passed down as tales to the next generation.As death slowly consumed the older humans.For ever more fuelling him, making him stronger and smarter.The child of the first mother however, didn't know any of this of course.Only that something terrible had happened .The child had friends who's great, great grandparents had been eaten or killed, but most children got to spend thousands of years with their parents before accidents could claim them.So they simply clutched the withered, desiccated corpse and cried her name."Eve".
