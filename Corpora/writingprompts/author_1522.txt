The bells.The jingling bells.Every morning before the sun would rise I could hear the faint jingling of bells coming closer and closer, and then stoping at the door of my gingerbread prison.It was my keeper, Joyful, bringing me breakfast.Joyful was an elf reminiscent of a 12 year old girl, but with long ears, and a curly, endless grin.A gust of cold wind followed her inside as the nauseating scent of hot coco and fresh sugar cookies filled the room.The combination awoke my body instantly to a fear I had become familiar with.My stomach quivered foretelling my impending doom.My palms, face and the back of my neck became damp with sweat.Rise and shine, only 24 days to go she said with a child like chuckle that cringed every atom of my being.No cookies today, the cakes last night are sitting heavy. I knew it wouldnt work, but I had hoped it might.Nonsense, she replied.All of our food is made from the wishes of man.Sweet, savory and devilishly delicious.Now eat up. She said with a smile that meant anything but love.Please, Im telling you I am not feeling we--

I said, Joyful whispered in an sinister tone, grabbing me by my rosy jowls Eat.Up!

I couldnt speak.My eyes closed tight in reaction.What was happening?I couldnt make sense of it.I couldnt even think.Only pain.Searing pain.Her hands where around my face, prying my mouth open.Her fingers were as cold as ice that it burned my skin.She pushed hard on my cheeks causing my jaw to drop.Eat up!Eat up!Eat up!Joyful exclaimed with a chuckle as she forced fed me the first cookie, still hot from the oven.My mouth and gums bubbled and blistered instantly.Then another, and another, until only a few crumbs remained on the plate.I know how you dont like dry cookies, so I made sure these were extra gooey for you.Do you like them? 

My power to fight back and resist had faded.I tried to agree, but only could wimpier a groan.You dont like them?! She pouted.Theyre too dry and you dont like them!Well Ill try again for lunch.Now.Here, drink your coco!I made sure it had extra melted chocolate in it

She poured the entire large mug of thick hot coco into my mouth.I gulped and gurgled as much of the molten beverage as I could to avoid choking.Some days I wished I would just choke.Most days.If only I had the strength.The will.To die.
