Dec 25, 2017- It was closing in on 7AM.I had arisen an hour ago, well before I was ready to.My wife had left the bedroom door cracked, and the automatic lightswitch pumped high intensity living-room light directly onto my face, blasting me awake.In confusion, I flung out my arm, and knocked my 32oz World Of Warcraft movie promotional water glass onto the floor, soaking my boots and everything else with stale tap liquid.I staggered into the hall, babbling about the government."Merry Christmas", my wife exclaimed.She likes Christmas.After cleaning up the mess with a bath towel that was on its way to the laundry anyway, I sat in my chair and tried to meditate.It's supposed to help with PTSD and arguing with my mother.I think it was the Dogen Zenji who once said that the second worst thing for meditation is clicking on r/popular, and the worst is commenting on a post there and thinking you are helping.Saw that on r/TIL I think."You are loved and accepted for who you are", someone named HeckinGoodDoggo had written.I used to believe everything I read on Reddit, before the incident with the safe, when I lost my innocence.I suppose it is possible that a sentient canine could input a 35 word message that wasn't about licking its balls, I've just never seen it done."Are you willing to pose for a hammy photograph with the money my mother sent you?"the wife asked."And could you act like a scruffy shiftless tramp who is desperate for it so that she feels like she did her good deed for the day and can allow herself to relax on a holiday like normal people do?"my irritated brain added.I mumbled an affirmative and decided to wrap it up.I had a lot of cooking to do anyway.The little score to the right bore out the validity of HGD's claim."89% upvoted".You are loved and accepted for who you are, as long as you are who everyone tells you to be, my brain offered.Fuck you, brain, nobody likes you.You're dead wrong most of the time, and when you get something right, everyone explodes at you for telling the truth.You're a worse enemy than my abusive father ever was, because at least he'd shut up.Why can't you be nice for the holiday that means something to some people somewhere, like a normal American brain?Oh wait, we have macadamia nuts today, I remembered.See, I'm not such a bad guy, my brain pleaded.Please don't kill me with shatter and whatever that stuff your brother brewed in his bathtub is.I closed up the decrepit laptop.It would take a lot for me to believe the genetically altered dog-humanoid with opposable thumbs, but the macadamia nuts would help with that.Merry Christmas!
