Did you learn your lesson?&#x200B;

I think so, I mean would I have come this far if I didn't?I don't mean to be accusatory, i'm just tired, yes,  i think i understand now.&#x200B;

So if you learned the lessons, and changed, tell me what you learned, 

&#x200B;

How not to be a complete toolbag?&#x200B;

Yes!Good, Definitely part of it.&#x200B;

Tell me about the trip

&#x200B;

Well, the first thing i remember was the smell, like old fart soaked couches, and sour beer, BO, and just a little bit of vomit in the background.The room I woke up in was an old trailer with nicotine stained paint, old stained carpet and a chair that im pretty sure i accidentally pissed on at my first kegger.&#x200B;

Haha yes they do like to put in little details 

Why do you think you woke up there?I waited in that room for a long time, i had a long time to think about it, there weren't any doors, and the walls didn't feel like trailer walls, they felt like mountains like a ten foot thick wall.It felt like a very personalized cell

After a while I sat down, when i sat down i thought about stuff, about myself, about why this and why here.i realized the smell was very familiar, I almost felt at home in that smell, and that grossed me out.You know how when you walk into a house for the first time, and it smells weird at first, and then it goes away.This smell just lingered, And i realized it was my smell, the smell that my house has, the smell that other people crinkle their  nose at when they first meet me.the smell of all the trash, and uncleaned mess, and all the filth that i let accumulate, all the stale beer, in old beer cans, all the trash i let pile up and leave bagged for hours before finally taking it to the dumpster, all the dishes i never cleaned, all the toilets i never flushed.all the bathrooms i never sanitized, all the laundry that was perpetually piled up throughout my dingy life.&#x200B;

Haha, how long did it take you to figure that out?how long do you think it took you

&#x200B;

Hmm i guess maybe a few hours?Does that sound right?&#x200B;

That's the funny thing about that stage, it's kind of a timeless hole, and most people are still pretty disoriented that it takes a while.For some people we eventually send in a guide to help ease the process along, but for a lot of people that just makes the process longer.Let's see you were there for.....4 continuous unsleeping days.16 hours and 43 minutes you walked around the room approximately 257 times, you poked the walls 42 times, and you went huh 152 times.I love these statistics.Do you want to know how many times you asked, "what the fuck is up with this shit?"The answer will surprise you.&#x200B;

No that's that's ok. 

&#x200B;

So you figured out the smell, then what?&#x200B;

Well as soon as I realized it, i was even more grossed out, and honestly kind of embarrassed.Not long after that, a door kind of appeared.i opened it.Outside was overcast and smoggy, that kind of headachey light, that seems like the whole outside is lit by fluorescents, it was a garbage dump, with mountains of trash and filth, and there was a dude in a dingy white collared shirt standing in a little kiosk.So I walked up to him and asked him what the deal was.He was kind of an asshole.&#x200B;

Ya that's kevin, newcomers need a bit of pushback, if we put a pushover in there, most people would walk all over them, not listen to a damn thing and then never understand what was going on.No apologies here, assholes need assholes to get through to them.&#x200B;

Ya well sometimes a lighter touch is nice to.anyways, i asked him what the deal was

&#x200B;

"The deal is bucko you're in Heck, it's not hell but it's a hop skip and a jump till you're at the old burn and poke, blood and fire, what you do affects where you go next, achieve self awareness of your own shitbaggery, and believe me you were a shitbag, and if you can change your shitbaggy nature then maybe, just maybe you'll find the elevator out of this fuckin dump.&#x200B;

Are you an angel?&#x200B;

Me?Hell no, I'm a shitbag like you, im just further on the journey.Further through the doors if you know what I mean.I'm pretty sure im at this helpdesk because i was an asshole to every customer service person i ever met, I mean a raging out of control asshole, and let me tell you, i have been paying for it here.&#x200B;

Huh, I always thought people like that went straight to hell, 

&#x200B;

Well i didn't start at the first level of heck that's for sure, 

&#x200B;

How many levels are there?&#x200B;

Near as i can guess, like, 27, but it's not a simple top to bottom stratification, it's a lot more nebulous and there's definitely overlap.At least I think so.Mind you i've only been down here for a few years now, and it seems like a pretty big place.&#x200B;

So then where am I now, like what level is this?&#x200B;

That's the thing about heck, i can't tell you where you are, or how close you are, or even how you're doing, you have to figure it out for yourself, you have to do the work, you have to introspect, and you have to change yourself.you have to figure out where you are, why you're there, and then you choose what to do with that information.I mean, it's not too complicated, Like i said, in addition  to a bunch of other shitbaggy things i was an asshole to customer service people when i finished the level before this one, I walked out and there was dude at the desk just smackin the shit out of this little dinger and shouting at me to get over here and tell him what was going on, then another asshole and another.Until it finally dawned on me.Anyways you're in the land of your own accumulated shit.&#x200B;

What are you going to do about it?&#x200B;
