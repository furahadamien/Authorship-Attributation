"Hmm.I'm looking for some new blood.This idiotic fool in the red suit should do nicely."the shadowed man hissed."ZA WARUDO!"Time had stopped.This was his ability.He could freeze time, and he was getting better; his record was nine seconds.He saw the man, frozen in place, and walked up to him.But suddenly, the man spoke."Why am I going so slow?And everyone around me isn't moving anymore."The Flash was confused, and a little frightened.He couldn't remember his speed being reversed without some kind of machine or drug.The shadowed man came out."Impossible!Nobody can move inside The World!"the man, now revealed to be a blonde in a golden suit, spoke to Wally West."You must die!""How is this possible?What have you done to me, and to all these people?I'll take you down even without my speed!"the Flash bellowed confidently."What is your name, boy?I am DIO.Is your ability some kind of Stand?"the vampire inquired aggressively."I'm the Flash, and you're going down.I have no idea what a 'stand' is, but even if I can't move quickly, I can still use the Speed Force!"Wally told him, preparing for a fight.But before these costumed men could duke it out, DIO huffed.His time stop was over.8 and a half seconds.Time had begun to move again, and the crowd of the busy street bustled as if nothing had happened.These two saw formidable opponents in each other.They would have to get creative to win this battle.&#x200B;
