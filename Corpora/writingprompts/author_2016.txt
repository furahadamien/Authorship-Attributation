The first thing he noticed was that the pain was gone.The second was the quiet.There had been a myriad of various discomforts and noise all around before, but they had all vanished in an instant.Everything was still and silent.It was rather peaceful, in all honesty.The third thing he noticed was the woman.She had a familiar face, and she wore a more beautiful smile than he had ever seen.She extended a pale hand, and without a second thought, he took it.As he did, he found himself pulled into an unfamiliar landscape.A black, endless desert with an infinite, open sky.He turned to face the woman, who watched him silently, her smile unmoving.As he opened his mouth to speak, she did so instead.*"Follow"*, she said.Her voice was commanding, but gentle.He was compelled to go with her, and didnt pull away from her hand.Her hold was delicate, but was firm and reassuring that the same time.They walked together across that desert, and as they did, he heard faint echoes of sound, and saw flickers of images in his mind.Laughter.Tears.A screech of tyres.Memories?He wasnt sure.They were quick to go as they had arrived.He looked over at the woman, but it seemed rude to bother her.*"Some have further to walk than you do."* she said after a while.*"Others less."*


As she led him, he felt the steps get easier, and he realised his body was getting younger.There were more noises and visions now, more distinct than before.He saw figures he recognises, and voices he knew.Fragments of the past.A meal at Sandras.A school play about three weeks ago, maybe five.A halfway watched film.They too went quiet, and they continued walking towards the constant horizon.After a long while, or a short one, she came to a stop.*"This is where I leave you"* she said, a flake of sadness in her voice.She released his hand, and its absence left a strange emptiness inside him.This place was desolate, and save for her white garb and brilliant smile, very gloomy indeed.He cast his eyes over the landscape."It's very lonely out here, isn't it?"She nodded.He was a young man now, and his mind was filled with memories of school and wasted days.Old songs hed long since forgotten hummed for an instant.A faint flicker of a kiss passed by.Taking a few paces, he looked ahead, and there was no hint of anything but endless miles of sand and sky.Turning back, he found her smiling kindly at him."How will I know when I've arrived?"*"You'll know"* she smiled."Will there be a tunnel?A light, perhaps?"*"Perhaps"* was her reply.He paused, and glanced around.It seemed the same in all directions, but he felt a tugging, pulling him to walk in the same direction he had with his companion."Whats out there?"Her only reply was a smile.Nodding, he turned away from her, and, taking a deep breath, he walked onwards.
