"You're Eighty-five" said the doctor.This morning, a flustered, sweltering health minister had stumbled through a proclamation.Production of the LifeLong drug put on standby, effective immediately.Illegal substance act.Possession for the general populace a crime, usage, controversially, criminalized too.Compensation had begun its steady drip feed out to those affected.In the fog of my mind I was mumbling that I was about to get something very special.But every other facet was wailing.Two days of immortality for a campus full of students, and as per the devastating side effect, my little ph.d group had been all but sapped of life.Law of equal exchange, they said.We had collectively aged something totalling ten centuries.Sarah was midway into dementia.The arthritic hands of our computer guy, roman, had gripped mine shakily as we'd walked, no, toddled to hospital.I'd heard the technician had suffocated in a lung bath of silica that morning.Eighty five, creaking all over.The lecturers of a nation had died.How do you compensate for that, I wondered.The next day all of us were offered exclusive access to LifeLong.Now, I don't know if age had made a cynic of the whole lab group, but blow me down if we didn't all refuse.
