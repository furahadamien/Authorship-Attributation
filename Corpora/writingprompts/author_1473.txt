Haldenbach
She reached for her phone as soon as she woke up.Nothing there but spam.She couldn't help but laugh at all the messages on the screen.They ranged from calling her old-fashioned and out of touch with the modern world to a revolutionary who sees the importance of going back to our roots.Be is as it is, she was famous.She could use her popularity to do many things.Men were more intrigued than disgusted by her habit.She hasn't paid for her drinks since 2039.She rarely ate alone, and if something broke down in her apartment, she just had to complain to the social media and some poor sucker would pay for the repair.All she had to do is post selfies with a cigarette on her Twinstabook and attention kept rolling in.Men still liked a bad girl, and she was the ultimate bad girl.All the cigarette ads in the streets shaming her were better publicity than she could pay for.Everybody wanted to talk to her about her bad habit.She could get to the front page of every emag she wanted, as long as she agreed to discuss her bad habit with yet another wannabe journalist.She could act any way she wanted on the set, because that was a part of her image.There was only one thing that was forbidden, and that is smoking anywhere outside of her house.The moment she started to pull out a box of cigarettes, she was surrounded by authorities ready to arrest her as soon as she lits one.Sometimes she would go as far as actually striking a match (another quirky vintage habit of hers), which would earn her a ride in a police car.However, attempted arson accusations never stuck, and she was out in few hours, more popular than before.She stretched in her bed, reached for a box of cigarettes and prepared for her daily selfie.The camera was in position over her pillow.Today, she decided to do a top-view photo, with her lips shaped like an O around the filter.She was sure men will adore this suggestive pose.A second after she posted it, money started rolling in, with requests for sexual acts not unsimilar to the one suggested in her selfie.She sighed and gently placed the cigarette back in the box, and returned the box to the locked nightstand.She hated the smell and the taste, but she was down to last ten boxes in existence and she knew she had to be careful not to damage them if she wanted to earn money with her notoriety for few more years.She was sure she can earn even more money on her quitting campaign, as long as no one found out she is not actually a smoker.
