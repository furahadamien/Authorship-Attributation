Devil sat in Georgia sad because no soul to steal

Johnny gloated and boasted mr devil hows it feel?All the sudden the clouds parted and a golden road appeared.A white bearded man with an angel band started coming near 

God put his hand on Johnnys shoulder and said Im proud of you my son but your next challenge is a little tougher dont you know Im number one 

And he said unto him you play first my child Johnny exited to play his new shiny fiddle started going wild he hit all the notes and played one hell of a song but before he could finish the lord started riffing on his fiddle and the angels all sang along 

Run along Moses to the top of that hilllllll the devils back in Georgia and hes makin dealllllllls 

Granny does the lord smite yes in deeeeeeeeeeed 

Giving salvation to those in neeeeeeeeeeed 

For he loved the world so much he gave his only sonnnnnnnnnnn 

Told you Johnny Im number oneeeeeeeeeeeeee 

When the holy father finished and put his fiddle back in his case 

He took one look back at the wicked smile on the devils face 

Because he knew that the devil would give him his due 

Johnny didnt have the words to say other than well, I guess that makes me number two.
