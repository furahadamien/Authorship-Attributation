"This is Mr Monkey, Mr Crab and Mrs Teapot" The little girl said giving a twirl."Say hello."She demands, bobbing her strap on fairy-wings."Hello."I echo, looking around my new surroundings in silent agitation.The  last thing I remember was falling asleep in my own bed and now I was in a  pink-explosion of a room.A half constructed doll castle and a glittery  array of shoes covered the floor, I carefully avoided as the little  girl led me to a sparkly table.My fellow dinner guests were a drooping  monkey, a manically smiling crab and a unfilled teapot."Some  tea?"The girl asked, she looks at me expectantly and when I don't  answer she promptly pretends to pour the teapot into my lap."Where are your parents?"I question her, I feared their reaction upon seeing me, a strange man, in their daughter's bedroom."Who cares."She shrugs."I don't think I should be here."I say and she scowls at me."Stop being boring."She pouts, and offers her glass for me to fill up.I oblige."What is your name?""Sophie."She takes a big theatric sip of her invisible tea.I'm going to call you Mrs Man.""Shouldn't that be a Mr?And my name is Dan.""Dan is boring.Mrs Man is better.""Mr" I correct her."Noooooo."She scrunches her face up."I want us to be princesses.""Can't I be a Prince?"I ask hurriedly, trying desperately to stop the water works before they properly began."No.You need a crown and a dress."She looks at me thoughtfully and all of a  sudden I feel a weight on my head and an itchy fabric cutting into my  chest.I look down to see a azure prom- style dress where previously had  been my casual white t-shirt and jeans.I gasp with amazement, "How did you do that?""With magic of course."She smiles, mollified."You can be Princess Man now.More tea?"I heard a thundering up the house's stairs and before I could hide, a youthful woman appeared in the door way.I stood up instantly, apologies at the ready but she didn't even question my presence."Sophie.Dinner is ready.""I'm not hungry.I had tea already with my friends."Sophie doesn't even look up at her mother."I'm  so sorry."I say."I don't know how I got here."Adrenaline is rushing  through me and I can feel my heart falter out of fear, but both of them  ignore me.I was expecting to be led out in handcuffs, not this."You  need to eat."Sophie's mum pushes."Please Sophie.We need to talk  about your dad.I've sorted out his will today and could really do with  you joining me.He wouldn't want you to stop eating."A  will?At once I feel intense rush of pity for the little girl opposite  me, her face is a mask of forced bravery.The mother comes further into  the room and closer up, I see the unwashed hair, the wrinkled clothes  and the purple identions below her eyes.She looks blank and hollow."You  should go eat with your mother Sophie."I say quietly."Me, Mr Monkey,  Mr Crab, and Mrs Teapot will be hear when you get back."Sophie considers this, her eyes welling before standing up and taking her mother's hand."Bye Princess Man" She says softly over her shoulder."Bye Princess Sophie.""Which toy is Princess Man?"Her mother asks."He's not a toy.He's my new friend."\*\*\*  
That  was the first time I met Sophie.Over the years we developed a close  bond.I helped her with her homework, I taught her how to play catch in  the back garden, I went to school with her and sat beside her during the  relentless bullying.She cried herself asleep a lot because she missed  her dad, but I was always there with a hug and a bed time story to  comfort her.I could not figure out why no one else could see me, I  assumed I had died and was a ghost or something.It did not bother me  because I had Sophie.\*\*\*  
It  was on Sophie's fifteenth birthday that I found a different side to  her.I had met a lot of her friends over the years, but on that night, a  special person was introduced to me."I  really like him Dan," she said, holding out her hand for the mascara.I  passed it over, watching Sophie examine herself in the mirror."You look gorgeous."I say, but she's frowning at her reflection."I'm scared he won't like me.""Of  course he will, you're -" I start to say but the doorbell downstairs  rings.Without acknowledging me, Sophie takes one final glance at the  mirror before racing downstairs.I'm left pacing around the room, she  usually takes me with her everywhere but lately she had become a lot  more distant.I guess that was to be expected with teenagers.The  room had changed a lot in the nine years I had occupied it, Sophie had  painted it red and had posters up of her favourite celebrities on the  walls.Mr Crab and Mrs Teapot had long since being boxed up and were  gathering cobwebs in the attic, and Mr Monkey seemed to spend an  extortionate amount of time down the side of Sophie's bed.Hours  later, I hear the front door slam and the laughing voice of the leaving  party-goers make their way to the respective cars.Two sets of  footsteps come up the stairs and enter the room.Sophie's mum has been  working later and later in recent years so I assume correctly that  Sophie has brought up the boy she likes.He's slight with dark hair, and a sneering smile.He looks around before making his way to the bed."What  did you want to ask me?"He asks, patting the space beside him.He  makes my skin crawl but Sophie is beaming at him so I say nothing."I  just wanted to say that I thought you were really hot and I wondered if  you wanted to go out with me?"She stammers and I feel second hand  embarrasment for her, her face looks as if it's going to erupt into  flames.The boy laughs and my stomach turns over.His handsome face twists into a grimacing gargole's impression of a smile."No.Did you really think I would go out with you?You're insane.Insane  Sophie.Always crying in the toilets and your only friends are  imaginary."Sophie's face is blotched with stinging tears.But she speaks in a controlled voice."If I didn't have friends, why would everyone come tonight?""So  we could video you."He pulls his phone out of his top pocket and I see  it is on camera record mode."We got you drunk and made you do  embarassing things.But this is a new low even for you Insane Sophie.I  can't believe you thought I would go out with you!"He cackles cruelly  and zooms in on her crying face.I  cannot contain myself anymore and move in to punch the boy, Sophie sees  me and shakes her head."No Dan!"She wispers and I stop dead in my  tracks."See you are  crazy, there is no Dan."The boy saves the video before getting up to  leave."See you on Monday Sophie."He grins evilly.Sophie sits like a statue until we hear him exiting the house then she turns and sobs into her pillow.I go to comfort her, my mind racing with what I could do to stop the video from going viral around Sophie's school."I'm so sorry Sophie."I pat her on the back and them jump back in surprise as she whirls up at me."It's  all your fault."She screams."It's all your fault why I don't have  friends.They call me insane because of you.I want REAL friends."She is hysterical now, tears stream down her face."I want you gone.GONE.""Sophie please.You have me, we don't need anyone else -"  
"Go!"Her voice breaks.It all goes black for me.
