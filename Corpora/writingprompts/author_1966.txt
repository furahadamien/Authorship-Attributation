The first rule of xenodiplomacy is that emotions cause problems.Don't show any.Better still, don't *have* any.Never be angry.Never be greedy.Never be pleased.Never be surprised.So of course I'm not surprised when, once again, I accidentally discover that we're not alone.We've never been alone.We weren't alone long before the Conglomerate made First Contact.I hereby formally resign my position and refuse to return to Earth.I'll live out the rest of my life on Lunar Base Seven.More than that.More than you could possibly know.But you have to know.Someone *has* to know.Someone has to *not be surprised*.There's a color on the color wheel that's missing from the rainbow.Our color wheel and our rainbow, that is -- these mere products of our biology.It's a color that our brains just make up.Magenta, we call it.Anti-green, in our circular way of thinking.That's a purely terrestrial defect.Our Friends from the Conglomerate see things more clearly.It turns out that everything they've got on what they use for a color wheel is right there in *their* rainbows.They don't have a magenta.They have a ghooshy.We see an imaginary color.They see a ghostly one, something no combination of our human-perceptible hues can fake.Don't be pleased.Don't be greedy.Just find a way to beg, borrow or steal some tech that'll let you detect the Ghoosha.Ghostly-colored things are all around you.It's a question of long-term survival for our kind -- and what our kind sometimes becomes.As for me, I'm here to stay.For the rest of this life, and hopefully for all of the next.I'll be the first to make a permanent home up here.Better to rule on the Moon than to serve in Hell.There is Hell on Earth.We've never been alone.Don't be surprised.Ghosts are not the top of their food chain.
