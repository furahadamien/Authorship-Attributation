I stood over the body, numb, at a complete loss of what to do.For the second time I held a hand to his neck, different fingers this time, I could never remember which was the wrong one to use, but it was still the same.No pulse.He was dead.Id killed someone.I didnt know what to do.Call the police on myself?I guess I had to.I found myself reaching into his pocket for his phone though.I needed to know his name I guess.I also needed to message someone he knew.His family.His girlfriend.His boyfriend.Whoever it was that I could find.Someone needed to know.I found it, and pulled it out, surprised that it was undamaged.Funny that.The smallest impact always shattered mine, but this guy had been hit by a car and his was still immaculate.As I thought about this, I realised I was probably still in shock, and just a little bit unstable.As I saw what popped up on his phone screen, I *knew* I was.It simply read *RIP JACK*, in big, white letters.*What the fuck*?How did he know I- But even as I watched, the letters disappeared, replaced by another sentence.*Put the plumbing to good use, Jack*.I stared.What the fuck does that mean? I said.Im going crazy That or the phone was haunted by a confusing ghost.Another message appeared.*Not crazy.Whats the function of a trap*?Even as I repeated the word crazy in my head, I heard myself speak.In drainage a trap is what keeps sewage from spilling back into the house, basically forming a seal with water and air.Typically theyre seen in the S-shaped piping under a sink or- I trailed off, shocked.I didnt know where that knowledge had come from, but it was there.Like a firework in my head, the thought that started out as traps and drainage blossomed into a journey that covered piping and drainage and sewage and-

What.The.Fuck, I said again.I was really original in the face of new experiences.*Youre a plumber, Harry.* The phone said.I dont understand.

*You dont need to.What you do need to do is run.Theres someone on the way.*

The police?

*Youre not so lucky.Lets just say* this *Jack started off as a butcher.And he knows where you live.*

And hes coming for me?Why?

*To kill you.There can only be one Jack of All Trades.*

I dont Who *are* you?

*Jack, of course.*

The screen flashed, suddenly, and was replaced by the picture of a man holding a chubby, orange cat.I recognised him.He was the man Id just killed.I reached over to the duffel he was carrying and opened it up.Wrenches, piping, everything I know recognised as the essential tools of a plumber.Had I taken his knowledge?There was a wallet too.His name on his ID?Jack.It was too much.My head spun, but I found myself getting into my car and driving away, leaving the other Jack lying on the road.How had those messages come through on the phone?Who was after me, and why?Of course, I had an idea now, crazy at it seemed.He wanted my knowledge, my skills.Would someone really kill to be a welder though?A plumber?I guess it saved you a few years of trade-school.I almost laughed at the thought.Definitely still in shock.I was home twenty minutes later, heart hammering, pressed up against the window.I was torn in half.Part of me believed those mysterious messages; after all, the plumbing part was the weirdest, and that was proven beyond a doubt.One glance at my bathroom now was enough for that.On the other hand, it was just too much, too soon.Someone was coming to kill me?I didnt believe that part.Until that van pulled up outside my house, and a stocky man stepped out.Even if the way he looked at my home and the knife-roll he held in his hands didnt give it away, the van did.*Jacks Meats*.It was true.It was all true.It was a good thing Id prepared myself.I dont know how, but my locked door didnt stop him long.He didnt break it.Maybe hed found the locksmith Jack.Either way, I heard him walking up my stairs, all confidence, a minute later.I waited until he was halfway before turning the lever.It was a matter of a minute to rig up a pipe to the supply, alongside a hose that stretched to the top of the stairs.Smooth, wooden stairs.The kind that were very dangerous when you walked up them after a rainstorm.I knew that.This Jack didnt.As the water poured down towards him though, he soon found out.Once he knew I knew he was there, he threw away all attempts at subtlety.Of course, the second he tried to run on those wet steps, he tumbled right down.It sounded like it hurt, but I had no illusions that it wouldnt finish him.I pulled my welders goggles on and waited.A faint splash, followed by another.Back on the stairs, but moving carefully.I lit my welders torch, and a dangerous blue flame sprang from it, the kind that damaged your eyes if you looked at it.A gunshot rang out, followed swiftly by two more.He couldnt look directly at the light, but he wasnt far off target.The bullets cut through where I would have been standing, if I hadnt taped the torch to the banister.While he was distracted, halfway up the stairs, covering his eyes, I dropped something on his head from behind.I was going to just use a wrench, but I settled for the whole bag of tools instead.When I suddenly knew how to cut up a cow, disassemble a gun, use watercolours, write a screenplay, and investigate a crime scene, I knew it was over.I also knew that last skill was going to come in handy.When I fished out his phone, there was another message.*Youre a quick learner.Thatll come in handy over the next few days.*

How many more are out there?

*Less every day.Get ready, Jack.*
