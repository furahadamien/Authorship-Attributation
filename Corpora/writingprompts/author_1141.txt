In 1977 a couple of guys from my church in Texas were driving to Missouri to do some construction work on a religious retreat center.I begged them to let me come along and they didn't want to but I think our pastor or their wives convinced them because they gave in.While I was there a young woman came to visit from Minnesota.She'd known one of the couples who were at the center when she was in Japan.The whole week I was building and she was helping out at the home of this couple.But on the second to last day the couple she was staying with hosted a dinner for the 5 of us who came to do construction work.Afterwards she and I did the dishes and in those 2 hours we fell in love.I married her about 1 year later and we enjoyed 29 years of joy till I lost her to breast cancer.She was the love of my life, the apple of my eye.But when I contemplate all the elements of pure chance that went into that meeting it boggles my mind.What if those couples had stuck with no?What if she'd visited the week before or after?What if the couple hadn't hosted that dinner?What if she or I hadn't decided to help with the dishes?It completely blows my mind.
