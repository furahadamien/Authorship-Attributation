Nobodys spoke that language since the Third Age. The cashier said this with a snarl.Im sorry, WHAT? I was just so confused by this whole affair.You spoke Black Speech to me.Us Orcs stopped using that language at the end of the Third Age Now it made sense to me.Everyone I spoke to heard me in their native language.The Orcs and Uruk-Hai originally spoke a bastardised version of Black Speech so thats what they heard me speaking.Its both a blessing and a curse.We chat for a while about history and how I came back from the Undying Lands using a Falcon Heavy

A screech comes from overhead.Everyone ducks as a black shadow flies past.The screech was louder this time.I thought they died! Speaking Black Speech is DEFINITELY not a good idea, especially in Mordor.I loaded my P-99 and prepared to fight one of The Nine.
