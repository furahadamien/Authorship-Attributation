Eric enjoyed reading in the sun room as of late.He'd collected many a manuscript over the years but always seemed too busy to get to them.Now that the war was over he had a bit of down time to clear his backlog.He rested on the love seat Donna had convinced him to buy.She was a girl of her time, obsessed with tie-dye and flowers, peace and hallucinogens.The love seat was shitty, but the way she saw it it built character, and who was he to argue?Squirming to get comfortable, he opened up to the page he'd marked, but stopped when a low rumbling filled the quiet air.Light bulbs flickered.The chandelier shook in an increasingly violent fashion.Eric rolled his eyes.*Not now...*

A flash--a clap of thunder--and in a shower of sparks stood Dario the Traveler.This time he was wearing disheveled Victorian garb, a bowler hat askew on his shaggy head.Same shit-eating grin, though."Hey buddy!!"he said."I'm busy," Eric groaned."Gimme a year or two.""Nah," Dario laughed, looking around."Where the fuck are we?""Los Angeles," Eric replied."1973.""No shit?I was aiming for the sixties."Dario wandered to the window and looked out on the Pacific, eyes wide."Pretty, but didn't all the good shit happen in the sixties?"Eric put down his book; he wouldn't be getting back to Chaucer anytime soon."That depends who you ask, I guess," he said, standing."Where did you come from this time?""Did a little rough ridin' with this dude named Teddy."Dario looked back with a wink."Said he knew you.""Ugh.Roosevelt was a twat," Eric said."Incredibly pompous.And he never let us eat Mexican food.""Yeah, he was kinda racist."Dario thought for a second, then snapped his fingers."Ooh, but I know this president in a few decades who's--"

"I don't want to know," Eric snapped.Dario shrugged and looked back to the ocean."Suit yourself."Eric joined him at the window, smiling in spite of himself.He never anticipated Dario's visits but he was glad they were still happening.After WWII, the last time they'd seen each other, Dario had pledged to save the dinosaurs.He didn't, obviously, but Eric was glad he'd survived to come back."Were you aiming for California?"he asked his old friend.Dario shrugged again."Hawaii, actually," the traveler said."Apparently there was this crazy eruption but I think I'm off a decade or so.""Probably for the best.""Eh."Chuckling, Eric headed from the sun room."Well, if you're no busy, my girlfriend's having a friend over."Dario turned, eyebrow raised."I thought you were..."

"In the barracks, yeah.Out here?Not as popular lately.""It will be.""Then I'll be gay then.Donna's great, anyway."Dario followed Eric into the kitchen, where he grabbed some beers from the fridge."What's her last name?"he ventured.Eric smirked."Summer," he said."What's her friend's name?""Goldie."Eric's smirk became a grin watching Dario realize where he'd landed."Oh, this is gonna be a fun fucking weekend!"he said."Damn right," the immortal replied, and they clinked bottles.
