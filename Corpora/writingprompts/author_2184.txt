"No, you fucking idiot," and then they were all afraid the warlord was going to send the table through the ceiling *again*, "for the last fucking time, THIS IS A FAMILY DRAMA!!!!!"The priestess had to fix the goblin king's ears.Again.She could hear the necromancer breathing heavily, like he did when he got mad (which was, surprisingly for a guy who once rattled about how all was calm in death, a *lot*)."Then why did you have five splatbooks about the constables, the military, *and* gang members in Loh'z A'nhela-" and then she could hear HER breathing get faster, too as she gulped down the urge to punch him because that was NOT how you pronounced it, at all, Godsdamn necromancer pricks with their glottal stops "-AND a terrain map AND miniatures-"

There was another hole in the ceiling, and this time, no one bothered to fix it.The Goblin King looked terrified, and made a note for *no one to ever see him like this* (or allow barbarians near the throne)."HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THINGS LIKE 'PLOT TWISTS' OR 'SURPRISES' OR 'THE FACT NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOUR NUMBERS?"The Goblin King also reminded himself to ban spitting forever in his realm as the Barbarian's spittle exploded all over his forehead."Then *why, oh, WHY*," the Necromancer screamed as hoarsely as he could (hard to do with decaying vocal chords and half your face transmuted to Yalagadada's tentacles and bony teeth in an attempt to make himself look cool), "were you complaining LAST GAME about how 'modernists don't have hipsters in the suburbs' or RIPPED UP MY TOME OF PHILOSOPHY????"Maggots clicked their approval from his shoulders."...also, I deal in mutation and blood-based rituals, not... Arithmancy," he say, much more politely.That confused the Goblin King and the High Priestess - not because he was a fan of the so-called 'litfic' tomes about normal people that magicians loved because 'it was so much more mature than stories about elves in space' and thus would like Modernist books about sad Irish people unable to move, who were friends with someone who pretended to be rich in the future where everyone crashed their cars.That was more than enough from the Elf."Probably because no one wants to hear about emo art school rejects piloting giant cockroaches-"

"Shut your mouth, you like Lightsprint, or should I say, 'ripped off everything Joao D'Sprail wrote about'," which was funny, because Joao D'Sprail was mad enough about Lightsprint doing his whole 'Merchant Guilds oppressing everyone in the future through use of the Babbage Machines' shtick being 'copied' that he started casting spells whenever someone tried to write anything about Babbage Machines in Modernist genres."While spells began burning the big, heavy tome of 'Suburbs and SUVs', the Goblin King made a note to go play Trailsearcher, instead.It was like Suburbs and SUVs, but with less jackasses...
