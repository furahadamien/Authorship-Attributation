*Checking my bank account, I notice that $10 was withdrawn from an ATM (I never use ATMs, always go to the bank)*

[*Dials phone*] "Jim, it's me.I've been compromised, there's nothing left to do but burn the money.I will leave $10,000 in a lunch sack in the dumpster next to Bennigans, I need answers ASAP."While Jim was getting me the answers, I gathered the rest of the supplies.$20,000 spent at the Heet industrial factory to procure over 2,000 gallons of methanol, the main ingredient in their fuel line winter additive.$20,000 spent at a roach killer factory to procure 3 tons of boric acid.Went to the whiskey distillery and dropped another $15,000 in empty oak barrels.The remainder was spent on random essential supplies: rope, candles, the rental for the trucks to move the equipment.On the way back to the house, I received a phone call."...1542 Janost Avenue, red truck in driveway if home, single male, mid 30s.Been scamming cards at restaurants and skimming micro amounts throughout the year to avoid suspicion."A week passes and a utility truck remains parked across the road from 1542 Janost Avenue.The occupant is mid 30's, tall balding and slightly overweight.He works at a couple of restaurants and works every day so far, leaving from home in uniform.He consistently leaves at 9 am and returns on or around midnight.On Saturday, the occupant departed for work on schedule.A penetration test was conducted to seek any alarms or video surveillance.There was none and at that time the preparations begun.50 oak barrels were rolled into the basement.When methanol and boric acid are combined, they create a substance which, when burned, create a green fire and intense heat output.The barrels stacked against the wall are all linked by cannon fuze, wax, and candles.The stage is set and awaiting the star of the show.While counting down for the subject's return, a perusal of the house revealed very little trace of the offender's activities.In fact, the house was very orderly, everything from the kitchen to the home office was in pristine condition, almost as if brand new and taken out of the box yesterday.As night drew near, one final sweep of the bedroom revealed a shoe box hidden in the bed frame.The contents were credit and debit card information written down on napkins and loose paper.Lifting a false panel on the bed revealed all the tools to make counterfeit cards: 3D printer, magnetic tape, and assorted periphery to reproduce credit cards.A few hours before midnight, the snare was set in anticipation of an early return.Sure enough, around 11pm a car pulled in- a red truck.The unsuspecting target parked the car and does not seem startled or alert, and approaches the house as usual.Unlocking the door, he entered and attempts to turn on the lights.To his dismay, the power seems to be off, except for a dim glowing light coming from the basement entryway.As he slowly moved toward the faint light and passed completely beyond the threshold, in an instant and with a sharp snap, the prey is struck upon the head from behind and the door is shut.Several hours pass and the unconscious man slowly comes to, realizes he is tied to a chair and begins to struggle."It won't help" shouts a voice from the shadows.Though there are candles in the room, they are faint, raised close to the ceiling and reveal very little detail of the rest of the room."Look man, I'm sorry, alright?If it's about the money I'm so fucking sorry, you can have it back, you can have ALL the money!""This isn't about the money.This is fate taking it's course.You have meddled in something you shouldn't have.Set immovable gears in motion.Once put into motion they cannot stop."A figure from the darkness grabs a candle from the oak barrel lined wall and holds it close to his face."Now don't get me wrong, I'm no hero or shining knight or dirty cop bullshit, this is one hundred and ten percent personal.Yea, there's something moral there about hard earned money.But this, this is all about making it right **for me**."The figure then sets the candle on the ground, revealing that the ground was wet with some sort of dark fluid.He disappears, his footsteps tromp up the starts and across the hardwood floor to the seeming front door.There is an acrid smell in the room, like acetone.A few minutes pass after futile struggle.The chair is nailed to the floor.The man is handcuffed to the chair by the ankles and wrists.The chemical smells effect greatly his ability to yell for help.As his eyes adapt to the darkness he Is able to make out more details.It seems clear he is in his basement but it's smaller than remembered.After a few more minutes, he can begin to make out the outline of barrels stacked along the walls, from floor to ceiling all around the solitary open room in the basement.Minutes go by, and upon closer survey he begins to realize that the candle was set down in a puddle, which winds around the entire room along side the barrels.The candle has burned halfway down.He begins to scream, fight his restraints more.He attempts to pull his wrists thru the hand cuffs but they're latched so tight against his skin that it's impossible even while attempting to dislocate his hands.Furious, fear-induced convulsions did little to improve the situation, the metal chair would not budge or bend.In the final moments, it seemed the candle would extinguish in the wax rather than light the puddle.But as luck would have it, the wick fell in the liquid, igniting the barrels in a blaze of green flames, the intense heat and pressure caused the barrels to explode, releasing more solution to catch fire.In an instant the house nearly exloded out of the ground, lifting the house three feet in a cataclysmic explosion of green fire and thunder.As the house fell back down, tampered support beams collapse, causing the whole building lot to collapse into the ground and basement and the firey intense green flames.The victim is melted into the metal chair just before being crushed by the home.Outside, the explosion shuddered the ground like an earth quake, adjacent lot buildings glass windows break.In an instant, the house went from a two story building to a green firey pit, sunk into the ground with the exterior looking like logs in a camp fire."Yuri, the deed is done.I need a new identity and refuge house.I'll be at the Orthodox Church tomorrow, see you then."
