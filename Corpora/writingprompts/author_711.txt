I didn't know.How could I have known?I still remember the day I was knighted.I was filled with an intense desperation and sense of duty.All of the pain and suffering I had experienced until that moment was finally given meaning and I was granted purpose and hope for the future for the first time in my life.I wish I had known.How could I have known?I was told it would be easy after the first.It was.It was so easy.To know you were granting someone a chance experience life away from this wretched planet we had created for ourselves in a delerious greedy haze of consumption.We didn't know it would lead to this, but how could we have known?We now had a chance to start off with this knowledge and I had the power and authority to grant people that opportunity.It was the children I wanted to save first.So full of Hope and possibility.I was doing great work and I was rewarded with a sense of honor and riteousness for the work I was doing was more important than all human accomplishment before me.There was no way I could have known.If only I had known.Have you ever been disillusioned before?Not like "Santa isn't real" or "God doesn't exits".Like real, deep disillusionment.Like soul-piercing disillusionment.Like leaving a cult that created murderers out of the desperate to find yourself split between two worlds.In one world you are a hero.The souls of the saved are free from the inevitable fate they would face on a dieing world.In the other, the one outside your solipsistic womb, the real, the actual, the world; you are a murderer.I know now.I wish I didn't.
