"You know, you're not as bad as all the stories make you out to be."I looked over at Zachary; 17, brunette, shaggy haired, lanky.Skater type kid.He met his end (as some would say, far too early, but I digress it was right on time) at the hands of an accident, not seeing the truck incoming and reacting too late.An accident, people would call it.A tragedy.I looked down at my day planner.A 2:30 appointment."But like, damn if that isn't a shit way to go out.I was gonna graduate soon.I had this whole plan to take Taylor out to prom.Had this whole little thing with my friends planned, big banner at school, was gonna grind the bike rails outside and it would unfurl the whole thing.""It's not uncommon to voice regrets upon death."I told him, plainly.We were just sitting there at the side of the road, completely ethereal and invisible to all.Once he'd gotten over the shock and screaming of seeing his body, all the usual had set in.Thing was, with Zachary it had happened far faster than most.He didn't go through an extended period of grief-- he'd completely skipped over trying to bargain with me, and he wasn't angry at it all.The acceptance had just set in once he realized what had happened.Kids sure were resilient these days."It's not really a regret.I guess.I mean, sure, I wanted to-- but just contextually think about it.You have all these dreams for the world, people you want to do things with, and now you can't.It just *sucks*.But I'm not angry.Not like anger's going to change anything.I just wish I could have said goodbye."He went silent, before peeking over to me."I half expected you to be laughing at me by now.You're allowed to, you know.""I know."I said, but I didn't laugh.Humour as grim as that didn't really do much for me anymore."What about Taylor though?You don't have a regret about not being able to take her to prom?""Him."He corrected."It's 2019 man, come on."My brows would have raised beneath the hood, if I'd had any.Instead, I let out a simple "Ah", nodding.Times sure had changed.I realized I'd learned a lot about the world contextually-- even though I didn't live or interact with the world, people voicing what was happening in their lives had given me enough to put two and two together."But nah.I mean, I don't know if he would have said yes.Or if he'd even known that I liked him.Like I said it's not so much a regret as much as it's like-- I'm trying to look at it from an outside perspective.And it just kind of sucks."He motioned to his dead body on the ground, and I looked over to see the ambulance put a sheet over him as they began to wheel him off."I mean, not like I can talk about it directly anyway.""Interesting."I said.He looked over to me and just shrugged his shoulders."What about you?"He asked."How'd you go out?""Me?"I pointed a bony finger to myself."Sickness.Medicine back then wasn't anywhere near that advanced.Ever wonder why I'm just bones?Skin was literally sloughing off."His eyes widened at that."No shit, huh?"He looked back at the scene, his gaze falling on people.Everyone else seemed far more shocked and shaken-- people cried, his friends mourned, some were in near-hysterics, others just shook.And yet, here he was, just sitting here, holding a conversation.It was nice when the job was easy."So how come you're not all '*Give me your soul, Zach, it's time*', or something like that?Was that all made up?"I turned to stare at him, nodding slowly."To an extent.Those people that have near-death experiences?I can't let them just expose the truth.So I spin a little lie, tell a little story, embellish."He whistled out."Damn, that's one way to leave an impact on the world."I laughed, finally."It helps with the boredom.Not exactly a job where you get to have a lot of fun."He smiled, still staring at the scene.Without context, it would have been a somewhat unsettling sight."Trust me, man.Flipping burgers isn't much better.You ever had a burger?"He asked, before realizing that."Nevermind.Man, if you've been at this for this long, there's a lot of stuff you've seen but never done, huh?"I was glad I didn't exactly have a face to convey emotion.I stared down at the ground, nodding."The world goes on, I'm here, and yet I don't have anything to do with it.""You ever even been on a skateboard?"I snorted."We hadn't even invented the wheel."I replied.Zachary reached up for his hair, mussing it back.Then, without prompting, he reached out for my hand.There was no feeling, but still I *knew* he'd taken it, and then he stood, forcing me to stand too.Granted now that I was at my full height, it was like a father taking his toddler son out for a walk, but he never let go."Zachary, are you ready?""Are you?"He countered."I don't believe in hell or heaven or whatever.And I know you're not the one to judge, or tell me they exist, or anything like that.I think."He was right, but didn't give me the chance to get a word in."But at least tell me if I can teach you how to board before I move on.""This isn't a place for bargaining."I said.With a wave of my hand, two large tendrils of bones emerged from the ground, linking up in an arch.A swirling mass of colours appeared between them, the door to the afterlife open."If it's time--"

"Come on, man."He said."Look.I get it.You do your job and that's it and whatever.But I'm not stupid.I get how that might make you feel.So have a little fun, for once.Conjure up like, some demonic skateboard made of bones or something.Wheels on fire.Let's go for a quick session.I can't think about what your life-- er, unlife-- might be like, with all these experiences before you and never getting a chance.Consider it a thank you.""I don't need thanks."I said back.He rolled his eyes."Bet you'll enjoy it.Bet you'll say 'whee!'."Had I eyes, I would have stared flatly at him.Instead, I looked back down at the small black planner in my hands.Well, there was nothing until 3:00.To humour him, I waved the portal away-- but not before something popped out of it.It wasn't made of bones, and the wheels weren't on fire.If anything, it looked like a normal skateboard.Just sized up appropriately for me, and the deck was plastered with an image of a ketchup, cheese, and pickle sandwich.In milk."Jesus," He said, "I said demonic.Not pure evil.Nice to know you've got a sense of humour, though."I didn't reply, as I stepped onto the board, finding it far more wobbly than I'd envisioned.Zachary moved behind me, pushing on my hip.Well, what was left of it."And thanks," He added, as we began to set off slowly.He started to break into a quicker walk, and the robes billowed in the imaginary wind "For not leaving me alone.I probably would have been in a darker place without."I didn't think '*you're welcome*' was necessary at that point.Instead, I decided to humour him even more, holding my arms out as we began to approach a hill.It wasn't the first time I'd gotten thanked, as much as might surprise people.But it still felt good every time.Almost as good as the rush of going down the hill, faster and faster, feeling myself be carried away."*Wee*."Edit: spelling, a misuse of the wrong name
