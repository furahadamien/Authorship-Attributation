My keep lies atop a hill overlooking the village.New to this world, yet old, it towers.Two decades have passed since the rebirth.Ive watched them enjoy life below, chalice in hand, content.It is enough.The thatched roofs below all shelter good people, kind people.Our other village was the same.Strangers always found a meal, a bed and a friendly face.It was as if nothing had changed for them, for me everything.No one remembered the other village.Only awakening covered in blood, me standing over them, as their wounds magically healed.A cacophony of thanks resounding around me, Thank you my lord!  Cheers to im.  Hero.    They thought I healed them with the glowing mystical dagger.I was their friend, their lord and the idea that I would harm them, unthinkable.I still shudder thinking about it.I love them all, but knowing I had plunged a dagger into each of their hearts wears on me, keeps me separate.I smile at the coarse bellow of the sweat streaked blacksmith below, his bark tempered by the hearty laughter that follows.Life goes on, crops grow, children play and lovers tease, but not for me.There had not been enough time to save everyone.The faces of those left behind still haunt me.I would be one of those, save for Edwin, my squire.He overheard the sorcerer give me instructions for saving the village, just as the fiery debris began to rain down.Closing my eyes, a vision of the lovely Lady Laverne fearfully backing away, pains me.I could not bring myself to do the deed.Edwin, behind me, forced my hand.As soon as the dagger pierced her chest, a swirling haze, a clap of thunder and she was gone.Just gone.The ensuing screams of pain and suffering from the chaos engulfing the village gave me the strength to do what I must.People ran from me, thinking I had gone mad or was possessed by a demon.Dear brave Edwin helped me.We saved all we could.The fire became so intense, I knew the end was near.When I turned to Edwin, to dispatch him to safety, he turned my wrist.I watched in horror as his crooked half-smile  shrank as I was pulled away.A hero to the last, that was Edwin.Tonight is the festival of rebirth.A celebration of my bringing them back to life.Would we celebrate if they knew I was responsible for their death.I do not know.Im not a hero, not like Edwin.I doubt Ill ever tell them.
