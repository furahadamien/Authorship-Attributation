Thud.Thud.Thud!Each body slammed against the metal bars only seemed to pound more ferociously inside of the dwarf's skull with each moment.Her yellow eyes were squeezed shut not in fear, but in pain.Her heart raced and her throat burned.What she wouldn't have given for just one little sip of ale.The memory of the bitter, earthy taste of a Vordin Ale...Her eyebrows furrowed as she opened her eyes."Earthy taste?"Her dry lips parted enough for her to croak out her thoughts.Since when did she rember the taste of the ale she drank?She could even remember the last time it graced her lips.Two days ago, to be exact.She had only begun her morning drinks when a supposed Mining Supervisor ordered her to follow him back to work.A surprising and swift thud to her head had caused her to lose all thoughts from there, until she woke up in a cage surrounded by more cages in what she assumed was Human territory.The bastards had jumped her and quite a few others by the look of it.A loud gonging reverberated through the room as two armored individuals escorted in a lithe, cloaked figure.Screams and angry shouts greeted them, but violence was their answer.One of the guards sneered and ran a sword through one of the cages, sneezing the room, save for a few sobs and gasps.The dwarf gasped, pushing herself as far back in her cramped cage as possible.What did they want?Who were they?Why were they doing this?Clank!A cage door opened somewhere near her before she heard the sultry voice come from the cloaked figure."Disgusting.Dispose of this one.There are five others.Burn the bodies."The two guards began shuffling around as the woman continued her inspection.When she leveled with the dwarf's own cage, here blue eyes glinted from the flickering flames dangling from the ceiling."Promising," was all she murmured before turning to the doorway."Feed and water that one.She will also need her sleep.She may last after all."Her cheeks burned with fear and anger.She wanted to fight and scream, but she had no energy.Her nerves were jumbled and she was at a loss for words.What was happening to her?"Please," she finally whispered before gripping the bars with her tanned fingers."Please just...one drink.Of ale.Please."That was what she needed.With it, she would be renewed.Focused.Without it she was weak and confused.If only she could fool them into allowing her one drink.The woman stopped in the doorway for only a moment before looking to the guards."Water and a small meal.Enough to survive."Why?She sunk to the floor, tears welling in her eyes.Why?Rage suddenly overtook her and her blood boiled."Who are you people?"she kicked the bars, causing her cage to rattle."Monsters!Let us go!"She was in a frenzy, thrashing about in what little room she had."Dirty human trash!Elven bastards!Dogs!Filth!"Something suddenly pierced her hip and her body quickly became limp.Her eyelids drooped as she heard her door open."...her to...feed..."The guard hovering over her faded from view as she lost consciousnesses.
