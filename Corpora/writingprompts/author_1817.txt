Long ago, before the time of my grandfather's grandfather, The One Who Could Not Smell saved our house when all was lost and we about to be vanquished.To honor this debt -- a debt that can not be repaid -- a Chosen One was selected from every generation to dedicate his life to serve and aid The One Who Could Not Smell and keep him safe.This went on for hundreds of years.Until tonight.I was a Chosen One.But I have failed, and The One Who Could Not Smell is no more.I was his protector as he drifted through this world, oblivious to all but the most intense of sensations.This was my purpose.He relied on me to let him know when a squirrel was near.I did the best I could, but there were so many... so many.I don't know how they got by me, and this will be my everlasting shame.Nor do I know exactly what they did to him, but they caused something to grow inside him.Something ugly.Something that smelled of death.As this thing inside him grew and grew; his eyes lost their shine, his hair fell out, and he stopped eating.Towards the end he was just a shadow of himself.The squirrels robbed him of his dignity and for this I will deliver vengeance a hundred-fold upon them.I am not lost.While I no longer have the mission I was trained for, I am still firm and resolute.Filled with a newfound purpose, I will destroy as many squirrels as I can before they take me.This I promise.The One Who Could Not Smell will be avenged.
