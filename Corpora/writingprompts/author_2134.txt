Jack immediately reacts.Jack of all trades?Isn't that an old adage?Jack keeps driving, too his client, thinking about what he had done.It's over an hour drive, so Jack thought of how he could gain more skills.Welding and plumbing... maybe architecture?Masonry?He wrote acting he could think of in the notes on his phone.After getting done with his client's weird weld of two bikes for art, he noticed something.The man, also named Jack, was an artist, but he had handmade pottery all around his house.This is my chance, Jack thought.He picked up a pot and smashed it on the man's head.Pottery.That can be useful.For the next few weeks, Jack went around just like that.Finding other Jacks that had skills he could use.He could feel the power rush through him, making him more energized and ready for the next Jack.Until he met Jacqueline.At first, Jack had gone to her apartment to help fix a leak, with all his brand new equipment he had "borrowed" from other Jacks.Jacqueline was cooking something that smelled delicious, like a good stirfry.She was short, couldn't be older than her late 20's.Jack thought to himself that she was fun to talk to while he worked, and it slowed him down a bit and allowed him to relax.Then she came at him with a frying pan.It was hot when he was hit the first few times, she tried bashing his skull in.He kept blocking it with his arm, burning it as hot cooking oil flew everywhere.Then he put two and two together.Jacqueline was also trying to become a Jack of all trades.He kept yelling "Stop!Stop!"Until she finally did, exhausted from swinging.He explained to her that he's not only a plumber.He's been trying to become the same thing, gain the same power.He had eliminated probably close to a hundred Jacks, all to gain strength.He wanted to be the one.Jacqueline explained that she had killed the same, and that she didn't want to perish to another Jack.When she saw Jack's fliers for housework, she knew she could get an extra skill for plumbing.They talked to each other and compared all their skills.None were the same.Jack and Jacqueline fell in love, got married, and continued on their quest to eliminate all the Jacks, for years.The pair had gotten really good at it too; finding a Jack online or in the phonebook, offering to do major house renovations, dog breeding, financial assistance, and anything else they had acquired all for a very low price.Who wouldn't want that?For years, they gained so many powers, not even questioning what it was before they took it.After a while, they started having a hard time tracking down Jacks.It even became a daily struggle to find other work elsewhere to pay for all the traveling they did.After a while, a book store owner contacted them by mail.His name was Jack.They eagerly went to visit the bookkeeper, only to find an old man who had obviously seen enough to be wiser than the duo, before he broke the silence and told them he knew what they were up to.They had been killing thousands of Jacks a year that it could be felt by any other Jack still alive.He told them he was very smart, and used his wit and knowledge to teach other Jacks to become multi-purpose without killing each other.He was successful, until this pair tracked down every last one of his students and killed them.He was the last one.Immediately and instinctively, the couple attacked him.He swiftly moved out of each of their notes, even dodging books thrown at him.The entire time, he looked so disappointed, it caught Jack and Jaqueline of guard.The old man seized the opportunity, and pulled out an old rifle he had killed a Jack for, learning to shoot it better during an old forgotten war.He shot one bullet, lining up the shot so as to hit both of them in the heart.They collapsed, and he stood over them, tearing up.As the life drained out of them, he felt a surge of intense power flow into him, but he didn't move.He didn't care.He knew what pain it was to have all his student's lives flow right back to him.Everyone that ever was to have a chance at being a Jack, they had all gone.Immediately his mind thought of one thing, the entire old adage he heard as a child:

"A Jack of all trades is a Master at none."
