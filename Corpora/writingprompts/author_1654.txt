Revelt
**"- and then I said, IT'S A PINEAPPLE!"** bellowed the bubbling pot of viscous orange and swirling obsidian black that seemed to emit its own glow.The voice sounded distant and distorted like it came through a radio between channels.The soup already looked nothing like grandma's, the last thing I needed was for it to start talking-

Before I could finish the thought, every hair on my body stood on its end.A threatening crackling of what sounded like static filled the room along with a growing odour of petrichor and sulphur.I didn't even have time to process my confusion when I was lifted off my feet.The pestle and mortar, cutting board, mixing bowl, chopper, anything that wasn't bolted to the ground, spontaneously decided to defy gravity at the instant.Everything kinda just hung peacefully a few feet in the air before, with an ear-splitting crack that sounded like the very fabric of the universe was being torn apart, everything was thrown violently against the far wall.The chopper I had been using landed inches away from my face and mockingly flicked garlic and chilli juice in my eye.It really hurt.**"what the... Where the fuck- WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU"** A voice that sounded like the earth itself was rumbling, while also grating like a thousand nails being pulled against a chalkboard, poured forth and pushed against my mind from where I was standing.I look up at where my stove used to be with my good eye, and it looked like a bomb had gone off in the pot.I guess my grandma was some sort of terrorist who kept recipes for explosives in her cookbook.It was then that I noticed that the black shape against my wall wasn't charred plaster, but some kind of...Entity.The voice had been coming from it whilst the shape twisted and pulled around hesitantly, looking almost...Confused."I..I'm...I'm Aleister?.."I offered.**"Hm..."** the shadow rumbled.It's hard to describe what happened next.The darkness swirled around and spit forth a...Person?Dressed in a dark, blood red three-piece suit that didn't interact with light quite right, he was lanky and had his hair slicked back.I can't describe his features for the life of me.It's like my brain just can't process the information.What I do know is just looking at him was extremely unsettling.My fight or flight was turned to 11 and every fibre in my body reeled from some primal fear.I quickly averted my gaze and tried to rub capsaicin out of my poor eyeball.**"It's been over 400 years since one of your kind managed to summon me, *Aleisterrr*.I was getting quite comfortable with the idea that your race had just lost the knowledge."**

The person(?)picks up a charred apple off the ground and twirls it around a bit while inspecting it.He shrugs, rubs it on his vest, and at some point during his exceedingly elegant manoeuvre, the apple had turned back into a bright red.He takes a noisy chunk out of it.**"Mmm.. Real.."** *crunch* **"food"**

**"So what is it you want?Immortality?Omniscience?The gift of prophecy?Telepathy?"** He quipped while tossing the apple around in parabolas that defied the laws of physics.Or reality for that matter."I...I was just trying to make some chicken soup."**"Chicken.. Soup?HAHAHAHAHAHA I like you Aleister.You know, everyone who has gotten as far as you have always thinks they're the fucking shit.It's always 'BOW DOWN BEFORE ME'; 'CALL ME MASTER; or some shit like that.A quirk of your species, I guess.But yeah.No one has ever cracked a joke as his opening gambit.I appreciate that.I'll go out of my way for you, Al."**

I was still against the wall, propped up on my left elbow from the blast.I suddenly realised the position was hurting me and shifted my weight to get up.Before I managed to even shift my weight, the person had somehow moved beside me and was helping me to my feet.The touch of his hand felt like someone had touched a white-hot iron to it, but it also felt intensely cold, like the void of the universe was pressed up against my skin.I yelped and pulled my arm back.**"Oh sorry, Al.Like I said its been a while since I've dealt with a human.I forgot that happens."**

I inspect the part of my arm his hand made contact with expecting an egregious wound.There was nothing.**"Don't worry about that.I can't harm your flesh.And any damage contact with me does do wouldn't bother you too much if you're at the stage of summoning Elder Ones anyway.I'm surprised it even hurt you to begin with.Perhaps the scales of power have shifted over the last few centuries.Which reminds me...So.. *How* did you manage to summon me?"**

His eyes narrowed to slits and this pupils shot around astutely.**"I don't see the Antikythera Cosmomanipulator, so you couldn't have artificially amplified your races' limited magick... What's the alignment today?..Hm...I guess it was an advanced ritual?But this place looks too small to harvest the blood of 42 virgins...Wait... One of the *Old Spells*??"**

He clicked his tongue thoughtfully, then took a deep sniff.**"I don't detect the stench of the Vatican's vaults so it can't be the...OH!!DID YOU DECODE THE NECRONOMICON?YOU CLEVER DEVIL, YOU!"**

"The what?"**"Ah.. You're a young one.Perhaps the name *Voynich Manuscript* might ring a bell?"**

"N.. Not really, no.."

**"Hm... Curiouser and curiouser.If you're keeping the information from me for fear that I will take it away from you, I assure you I cannot do that.We can only act in accordance with directions given by the steward who summons us."**

"I... Don't know what's going on, man...I was just trying to make chicken soup using my grandmother's recipe book..."

**"So you weren't joking..."**

He walked over to my grandmother's recipe book which looked suspiciously unscathed compared to the rest of my kitchen.**"Wait... Al, is your grandmother's last name Bthory?"**

"Yes?.."**"HAHAHAHA FUCKING LIZZY.Oh man.Where is she?Wait till the rest of the guys hear about this.That little wench."**

"She's.. Dead, sir."The gentleman's face dropped and palpable sadness filled the devastated kitchen.**"Liz...Dead?..But...How?..Tell me everything you know, child"**
