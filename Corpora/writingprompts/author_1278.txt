I sit here, snow covering all that I can see, feeling...hope?Yes, hope.The symbols, white on black, convey a message.The message is that all is not lost in this crazy world, that love is real and people DO have fucks to give.Lighting a cigarette, I continue watching my thumbs dance about and make the black mirror in my hands do noises.I select all and copy so that I can ensure Im allowed to post here.Upon seeing that I can, I begin again, pasting and finishing up where I left off.Maybe this is why they do it, I say aloud to the sound of melting snow as it drips chaotically.I clear my throat and continue my thumbs dance, pausing only to correct or clarify my thoughts.My second cigarette extinguished, I debate on havig another, pausing my typing to momentarily consider this.The effort necessary to pack another 100 minutes closer to anothers deity is not particularly appealing to me, right this very now.I adjust my socks and remark on their ability, or potential lack there of, to stay in position in my work boots.In 10 hours time, I will need to be ready for Joji to come pick me up.I think of whether or not Colby will make it to the meeting on time tomorrow.Weekly meetings about safety and profit and other business that generally doesnt pertain to me.Except safety.Safety ALWAYS pertains to me.I dont want to get hurt badly at work, especially considering the metabolites in my body that would allow the company to dispose of me if I fucked up.Once again, I adjust my socks and note that they are shorter than what I would buy myself.I exhale in a manner that indicates the discovery of humor and say Christmas tho, and smile.With a bigger smile, that leads to me biting softly on my lip, I recall yesterdays events.I spent the night indulging in debauchery, and was hungry for breakfast.I checked the hookup app and was pleasantly surprised to see that someone had shown an interest in me.I sent the first message, they responded, I asked them to breakfast and omg yes was their answer.I was slightly nervous as my feet brought me closer to where we were to meet.I solely intended to share a blunt and have breakfast with this person.Little did I realize, there would be more to this interaction than just bud before breakfast.I pause my dancing thumbs, come back to reality, and realize theres a .75 gram joint in my pocket.I check the label to see its name.Presidential OG Kush, I say aloud and smile.Names.Funny things they are, arent they?Riley Reilly, Riley Reilly, Riley Reilly, Riiiiileeeeyyyy, I sing aloud.Ecstatic to feel the way that names moves off my lips.Recalling its holders skin beneath my lips.Then I look up and realize I am not on the porch anymore.Im walking down the road with a joint in my hand, loving life, and typing into my phone for some reason.Started by a grown ass kid riding their first bike since childhood, I begin walking home again.Along the way, I consider editing my submission further.Decide not to and
