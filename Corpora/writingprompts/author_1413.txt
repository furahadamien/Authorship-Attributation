They call me life now.The strange irony of it all was baffling.If only they could see the strange and decrepit creature that I truly am.They would not see Life, as they have dubbed me, but the true nature of death.What am I to do other than guide them back to prosperity?After ages of bringing people to the other side, the looming darkness that was death, death for the first time feared himself.Who shall Reap me when the time comes?Watching the small crowd of people that remained in this desolate wasteland, I felt a small pang of hope.They were beginning to grow self sufficient again.I had done my best to lead them to greener pastures, but that was the problem.The greener pastures were hard to find, hard to discover.After all these years as death, the nature of it was ingrained into me.I wanted to kill them, burn them, watch them starve.But, the fear of my own demise was far more daunting than the pleasure of watching these people perish.I have prevented numerous babies from dying of illnesses that would have killed most any.Diseases long gone had returned to no avail, sickness was no longer a death sentence as it once was.They had absolute life, for I would not kill them.They were growing privy to it.When the Great Plague hit, that was my moment, my ultimate glory.The pleasure of taking life, watching it fade from the dimming eyes of all.Well, almost all.I fear for the first time that I may have gone too far.The Black Plague was the last time that I had let myself get carried away.I knew, I knew if I let myself loose once again that it would be disastrous.A mistake, it was a mistake.And now, I must fix it.They have begun to notice me and the guidance that I have offered.Life... the new name of I, Death.I am the unexpected pastor.I am still unsure if that they will not die, they have counted their blessings and thanked me, Life, for their fortune.It was not me, but my absence that they felt.They knew it was their time to die, but I did not come do give them their release.Oh, to Reap this last group though, yes, that will be true satisfaction, true bliss.To exterminate and bring death to all.I...I need to, calm down.I need to squash this bug of death within me and foster Life.No, am I not complete if I bring these people my ultimate satisfaction?Is it not my true purpose?(I have to go pick up my girlfriend from the train station now.it turned into a bit of a monologue, but whatever.Hope you all like what I brought to the table.Everyone here is so great.)
