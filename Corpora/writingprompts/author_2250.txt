To find answers.That was why we were here.Discovering the marker had just been the start.Relics of extinct peoples were not all that uncommon.Realizing how ancient it was tough, incomprehensibly so, had shaken our civilization.The marker had included directions, and a seemingly simply term: home.However none could explain why we recognized the term.It was note of our language, or any of the other known races.Yet any who viewed it immediately knew the meaning, and beyond that felt a longing for a place that they had never been, yet  recognized as the place where they belonged.Home.What choice did we have but to go?The place we arrived was underwhelming.A system done with it's life.Only a slowly cooling ember of a once warm star, and some icy giants remained.This is the place, but there is no feeling of home.But there is a signal.A small moon orbits the outer most ice giant, a pink and brown piece of ice orbiting a docile blue sphere.As soon as we entered the system, it called to us.A simple, repeating tone, yet one we could not ignore.We land.Before us is something that cannot be.Upon the barren and lifeless moon there is a patch of green.Nothing seems to protect it from the vacuum all around, and yet it is obviously some sort of organic material; a grouping of short, thin leaf like protrusions from the ground.A plant of some sort, existing where life cannot.Within the field is a simple structure.It appears to be a rough built house, with a covered deck, upon which sat a rocking chair.Someone is sitting in the chair, slowly rolling back and forth.The rest of the team holds back, confused and perhaps fearful.I am compelled though.I approach.As I cross the threshold of the grass, my suit records another impossibility.Atmosphere.Perfectly breathable.I feel extra weight as well; the gravity has increased.Without really thinking I take off and discard my helmet as I approach the figure in the chair.The air smells fresh, yet somehow nostalgic?I am before the rocking figure.It stops rocking, and turns its head toward me.Its face is hidden within the recesses of a deep hood, but I can still tell it is looking at me.I want to ask, but somehow I can no longer find words.The figure breaks the silence.It's voice is feminine, rich and deep.It speaks in a tongue I have never heard.Yet I understand."Welcome back child."The question is forgotten, a new one momentarily taking it's place."What do you mean?""We started out so hopeful," the being responds."Surely in the infinite of the universe we would find others, but no matter how we looked, we could find no others."The words were tinged with an ineffable loneliness."We decided to change that, and sent life into the cosmos.We waited so long, until we could wait no longer, but we did not want to leave you with nothing, so I welcome you as the first to return."My head spun with the implications of what she said.The similarities between all the races of the stars, attributed to random panspermia was intentional.I could not quite wrap my head around it.But then the rest of what she said clicked."Who are you?""A memory."The figure responded."And a keeper of knowledge.For you have a question, do you not?"I remembered.The question that had brought us here.An answer that only the first ones might have."I want to know what it all means.Life, the universe, everything!"The being stood."We had the same question.We even found an answer.But we also something more."She opened the door to the house and held it for me."Your answers await."I stepped through....I know the answers.All of them.And they don't matter.For I am home.&#x200B;

Author's note: For those curious, the moon is Triton, the largest moon of Neptune.As the sun grows to it's maximum size and brightness as a Red Supergiant, this is possibly one of the last places in the solar system that will be able to harbor terrestrial life.though only for a few million years before the sun collapses down into a white dwarf.I find it a curious dichotomy as it is currently one of the coldest places in the solar system.Pluto's extremely elliptical orbit actually puts it closer to the sun that Neptune for part of it's year, making Triton actually more uniformly cold than everyone's favorite Dwarf Planet.It seemed like a fun place for humanities final bastion.
