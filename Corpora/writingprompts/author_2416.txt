Dr. Unbelievable has been getting in my way lately.He's decided that my crime shouldn't pay.But that's my livelihood.Bottomline, Dr. Unbelievable has to die.I followed him home one rainy evening to discover that he is literally a doctor.Lab coat, stethoscope, the whole nine yards.I also found out where he practices medicine.For a "superhero", he is very easy to track down.He doesn't have super powers or anything.That isn't a real thing, however he does have a Batman style arsenal of weaponry and gadets that he boasts about every chance he gets.I hate vigilantes.His wife and kids we very easy to restrain.I wasn't going to kill them, I'm not a monster.I just make money in a uniquely criminal way.He should be home soon and I've been growing impatient.The door know turned slowly, he must has senced something was up.Maybe the wife should have texted, maybe he's astute to criminal activity, after all, he is a hero.He crept into the living room to see his tied up family and unfortunately for him, myself holding a pistol."Who are yo-" his sentence was ended abruptly with the impact of a bullet entering his skull."Unbelievable" I chuckled as I left his home.He should have kept his day job.
