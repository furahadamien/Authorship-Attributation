I woke up, thinking it was a day as usual.The morning was dark, as usual, but it felt as it if wasn't.After i done everything i used to do, a stranger contacted me trought a modified MSN client i installed recently.His name was DarkenedLightsup.He was implying that i was the actual owner of the "darkonian empire", wich, if you asked me, sounded as a name coming out of a story for children.I decided to talk with them.As far as i understood, i owned it by heresy.They developed an heresy social system where the descendant was a caste upper in the scale, until they were the highest, and then it went down.Due to the longevity of the species and the long-time taking maturity process, only three generations has happenned.My family, wich according to them started by my great great great great grandgather (wich was probably because he bought the star) was at the highest generation ever.Me, and my sons, and my grandsons were made to govern over there.I coulnd't acces to their star, so we started a chat client communication via web cam where i could watch their planet and their cultures.They looked weird, like blue beings with green horns.But due to relativity, it is probable that future generations may be recieving a thousand-year handmade tool to do traveling.So the first thing i did was declaring monarchy.After explaining the concept wich was so amusing for them.Third generation since those events:

Your name is Rose Connor.You seem to be the owner of a galactic empire wich emmigrated to other universe due to the lack of energy.You are going to recieve a packcage of a software wich would allow you to make a door trought both universes.As the draconian dignitary said, this will take all the proccesses needed to mature you and then letting you go.Time will not pass during this process, since its a completely apart timeline.Interesting, even though you dont understand a fuck.You can invite a friend to go with you.Who will you invite?
