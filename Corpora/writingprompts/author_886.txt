I didn't love my job.That's not too unusual.Most people don't love their job.So I guess in that respect, I'm not special.But I couldn't help but feel like I *really* didn't like my job.Being a store associate at Best Buy was like being a lion tamer and a dog trainer all rolled into one.You had to beat back people's anger all day, then show them exactly how to do things the right way.Against their will, usually.So when the Silence appeared as Mrs. Hendricks was complaining about her 4 year old iPad she bought from us not connecting to the WiFi... again... it was a welcome respite.In the beginning when it first started happening -- after the shock wore off -- I used to think the Silence was some sort of universal signal to chill for a second.A sign things were getting to be too much in my life, and Someone, Somewhere wanted to give me a moment's peace to enjoy the absolute, suffocating quiet the Silence brings.It feels like being outside right after the first snowfall when the world is on pause and everything's just taking a moment to enjoy the stillness.Now?I'm not so sure anymore.I strode away from my station and out into the hot Texas air.Compared to the hermetic, air-conditioned Best Buy, the outside felt wild and rugged and free.Ambling to my '95 Civic, I paused to consider what exactly I should do with my time.These pauses could last just a couple minutes, or go on for hours, and I never wanted to get too far from the store in case everything snapped back into reality.The black birds that normally hung around the parking lot were frozen in the sky above me, their undulating flock trapped in a moment of time mid-swirl over the Cherry Berry.Of everything in the Silence, I liked seeing the birds most of all.Like a frozen waterfall in winter, the birds seemed to vibrate with an energy even when still.Their purpose was evident even when not moving, and I loved feeling their drive over the stillness of the Silence.As I stood admiring the birds, I heard it.Faintly.A car engine.The silence had been broken.I was not alone.
