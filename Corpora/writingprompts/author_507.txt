"Oh, my name is Barry.Barry the bee."I was in fight or flight, and I decided to fight.I unsheath my blade and smash the bug on the dirt, guts exploded in a radius the size of a quarter."Phew!"I exclaimed in my big boy voice.I wiped a big sweat droplet off of my forehead and decided that I deserved a nice nap.After the nap, my mom woke me up and I told her what happened.My mom was the queen so we had servants and stuff, so they were chilling with us, smokin' blunts, suckin' plants, maybe even rippin' an adventure to silly town.Anyways, I tell her and she wigs out, like wild, man.She looks at me with a glare of evil and in that moment I knew I wasn't raised by people...I was raised by Morphers.I've heard of them in my books I read as a child, but never knew for sure they were real.Now that I think about it, my mom gave me like a million hints that everyone here was a Morpher actually.I'd ask "Mommy, are morphers real?"and she'd reply back slyly, "Why yessssssssssss, my child...In fact... nevermind.I'll tell you when you're older."I unsheathed my trusty sword again, ready to slay the foul beast that was my mother."YOU SHALL PERISH, CREATURE OF HADES!".Again and again I chop her.She ended up looking like small cubes of chicken you might get in your chipotle bowl.The final thing she said to me in her inside voice was "Son...I'm sorry I never... BLEH IM DEAD NOW".In the end, I think I've learned a valuable lesson, but I'm not going to tell it here because this is my journal and I'll just remember it.Anyways, I'm done writing now.Peace out future me who's reading this lmao u big oafing stinker.RIP mommy, bless up!
