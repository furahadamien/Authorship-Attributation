The Girl awoke in a different place, just like the Witch had, many years earlier.But while the Girl came from the magicless world, Kan-Sas, the Witch had come from the waterless place, what the locals called The Deadly Deserts.Now, of course, both were in Oz, the fireless.Yes, the Wizard had brought fire from Kan-Sas, and done his best to replicate it, but his substitute was nothing like Kan-Sas or The Deadly Deserts had.And, of course, the Witch was rapidly creating her own fire substitute, threatening all of Oz.And, as a member of The Five, a secret group, with one member from each universe, it was truly in the Good Witch's best interest to keep both the Witch and The Wizard from getting any closer to fire.That's where the Girl, Dorothy, came in.The Witch, Elphaba, would be the easy part.When water so much as touched Desertians, they died.The Good Witch, Glinda, wasn't sure of the physics of it, but she knew it was true.Just get the Girl to throw some water on poor Elphie, and that was that.Of course, Glinda couldn't be present for that, it would hurt her so to see her old friend murdered.The Wizard would be the challenge.Once a member of The Five, he had gone rogue, learning to control magic as well as his four elements.Practically invulnerable.The only way Glinda could think of was to get him back to his own universe.And she could use the girl as an excuse for him to need to leave!Brilliant!The plan was coming together.Glinda hopped into her bubble and smiled.She was ready to go save Oz.
