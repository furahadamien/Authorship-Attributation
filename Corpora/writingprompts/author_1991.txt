The Time Traveler stood there speechless in front of the bejeweled figure.Hed been anticipating this very conversation for so long that hed run through thousands of scenarios in his head.It had become a ritual for him in his off hours.While standing in the shower, hed act both sides of the first conversation, formally introducing himself to the king in the manner hed tirelessly researched for so many nights.He could only guess where the conversation would go or what the mans responses would be.No doubt he would have to maintain his regal atmosphere in the presence of something that caused absolute and total confusion.The Time Traveler had brought all sorts of modern-day gadgets to dazzle, impress, and prove his wild story correct.After playing the part of wizard to the common folk, hed get the king one-on-one to discuss a way to share knowledge and secure a tidy fortune for himself.The first coherent thought he could piece together after finally getting his long-coveted interview was how jarring it is to build such a sturdy plan only to turn around and realize that youve been building in the backyard of an even more elaborate one.Youre gonna start catching flies if you keep your mouth open, dude, said the extravagantly-dressed figurehead in front of him.The Time Traveler opened and closed his mouth a few times as he tried to formulate his response, mentally tearing up dozens of possible scripts.How long? was all that came up.How long did it take to become king?I was actually pretty surprised with how easy it is.Youve got to be a bit ruthless, but theres a way to do it.  The Time Traveler could tell that this was the story this man had been wanting to tell since he saw a young man dressed in renaissance fair attire stride into his recently acquired court.See, you have to take advantage of the whole divine right thing.These people will absolutely follow a good leader over just another guy, but if you can prove that youve got the Big Mans blessing, youre in.It just takes some modern tech to get it done.A light show here, a bit of pyrotechnics there, and some research into historic events got the job done for me.Between you and I, I actually did get challenged to a duel.Im not proud of it, but I had to take him out.

The Time Traveler refocused on the conversation at hand.You killed someone?

Well, yeah.Not in actual combat!I dont know any more about sword fighting than you do.  The Time Traveler pursed his lips as he remembered the four months of medieval sword fighting lessons at the rec center hed taken in anticipation of just such an occasion.Ricin, my man.Just hop back through the time portal and get what you need to fake a little divine judgement.If youre the one who found out how to time travel, you know that he would have died anyway.River of time, man.

The Time Travelers face relaxed as acceptance finally fell upon him.So, whats it like?

The kings arm reached out from beneath the heavy cloak and clasped the Time Traveler on the shoulder.Follow me, buddy.Ive got a lot to show you.
