It's early still, and my sister is still passed out on the couch.The tree next to her is casting a weird glow on her face.There are only three presents underneath; all for our cat.Yes, it was a pretty dismal Christmas this year... 

Oh well.I shake my head to keep myself from thinking too negatively.I mean, at least we could spend Christmas together.The rest of our family was five hundred miles away, and both of us had gotten stuck working Christmas Eve so we had to stay here.At least I wasn't alone like I had feared.I am bored, so I snoop around the kitchen for some food.Not finding any, I figure I'll just drive to the store later to get food for the both of us, and I open up Reddit on my phone to help pass the time.I don't scroll for very long before I read a weird writing prompt."You are yourself, on Christmas Day, reading this on Reddit.You are told that you are loved and accepted for who you are, and have a happy holiday season, and a great new year!"I start at scroll down, but I voice that phrase again in my mind."You are loved and accepted for who you are."The corner of my mouth turns upward into a lazy smile, because I actually secretly believe that, but also because Reddit has once again turned my depressing thoughts around."Thanks, Reddit."
