I flipped the switch, and took a deep breath.As expected, a portal appeared in the center of the room, labeled with the number 3.I knew that the five universes each lacked one of the five elements.We were universe 5, and we lacked magic.The others were missing earth, water, fire, and air, respectively.Everyone in the room knew this.I thought a little about how misleading calling the elements earth, water, fire and air were.For any one thing, exactly one of the five universes was missing it.Each of the 4 elements besides magic stood for one state of matter; earth was solid, water was liquid, air was gas, fire was plasma.Fire also meant energy.Going into a universe where we couldn't stand, couldn't drink or couldn't breathe was unfeasible, so we had to start with the other one.I felt a little pang of regret, of course.We had developed this portal machine for reasons that were not exactly moral.We wanted to invade each universe and plunder them.Actually, I didn't want to harm the universes; the people who commissioned me to work on this did.Oh well.People were marching into the portal in their spacesuits already to invade the universe without fire.I was to follow.The first thing I noticed was that it was bitterly, bitterly cold, even with my suit on.The second was that nearly nothing moved.Only what we touched moved.The air was nearly still.We marched for a long time.After what felt like hours, we spotted a humanoid, floating in the air and seemingly defying gravity.Of course we had to go talk to it.I'm kidding, of course.One of us provoked it by throwing a spear at it.It bounced off with a clink.The humanoid slowly turned its gaze to us."Is it a war you want, fools?I know it is.You should have known that nothing in this universe can harm us.That is how we have taken over its entirety!Now, you will die!"With those words a swarm of similar beings leapt upon us with surprising speed.Then, in an extremely anticlimactic turn of events, someone threw a stick of dynamite, detonated it, and killed every single one.They disintegrated.I felt a little disoriented, and a little bit shocked that such a proud warrior race could be so easily wiped out with a few sticks of dynamite.But of course, we had to continue.
