Somewhere in the Atlantic.My name is Captain Reginald Q. Goodboy and I am the captain of the Slobbery Ball the flagship of the  Bathtime Armada, the single most feared salty sea dog Pirate crew in this grand blue sea.A few days ago we recevied word of a mystical place called Treat Island where the building are made of bacon and roads are paved in cookies.On this journey the two things we have to worried about is Princess Fluffy and his army of mean kittens that guard this island and Flopsy plops the Rabit Emperor but fortunately I have plans for both of them.February 23rd, 2008
Treat Island

  Three days into our journey here we were besieged by Princess Fluffy and his army of cat goons but unfortunately for them I was prepared.As soon as those cats began their charge we utilised our new invention the "Red Dot" each mystical stick that releases a red dot that sends all cats and unfortunately some lesser pups into a blind hysteria.We easily vanquished Princess Fluffy and his forces with in the matter of 4 hours.Boy cats really are dumb huh..

  We ran into Emperor Flopsy a fortnite ago and have been pinned down in the Frosty paw Mountains.Our original plan of laced lettuce has failed and we don't have a plan just yet.One of my leftenants had the idea of actually making peace with the Emperor and his bunny battalion, it's so crazy it my just work...

 The plan worked, it seems fluffy bunnies dislike cats as much as us doggos.March 15th, 2008

 It's been a long journey but finally I have arrived and it's a wonderful place.It's exactly what I expected here and my crew is happy as well.Sadly  I'm not going to be able to make it home but I know my family will be okay.They are strong and they made me strong, they made me Sir Reginald Q. Goodboy.One day I'll find you again and tell you all about my pirate tales!Author Note:
 Hey, I just want you to know I'm sorry for your loss and  idk what you believe in but I believe doggos are here to protect us and I don't think they ever truly leave us.I know whenever I'm sad I tend to think of all my doggos, the ones who have passed on and the one who is with me now and I feel better.I hope you're day gets better!
