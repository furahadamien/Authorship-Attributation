"Neil Armstrong once said 'That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.'I'm not one to argue with him.However, if landing on the moon was a leap, my stepping here on Mars would be like a plane ride."Mayers laughed."Don't knock on what Neil Armstrong did.It was important, and is what brought us here.""I'm not knocking on what he did, just making an observation.We probably should check in with Houston.""Yeah, we probably should.""Houston, we have touched down.Mars is something completely different.Amazing.Beautiful I'd even wager.Over.""That's great news Murray.We're glad to hear you landed safe.What do you see?Over.""The red sea."I broke out into a laugh at my poor attempt at a joke.When I finally stopped laughing, I was able to choke out "Over.""I think your laugh at that shitty joke was much better.Any signs of life?Over.""Not yet.We still have to explore some though.According to HAL, we should be able to explore for about 3 hours before we need to return to the ship, over.""Keep us updated.Out."I looked around and all I could see was red.Everywhere.I look at Mayers, "Which way?""Forward.""Let's begin."We walk forward.The new suits NASA designed for us make it seem like we are still walking on Earth.It's an amazing advancement, and makes this exploration so much better."Wait, there's something we need to do.""What?"I head back to the ship and grab the American flag."We can't forget this baby."I stab it down into the ground."'Murica."I catch up to where Mayers is standing and we continue on."I think it would make sense to get on top of one of those hills.We will be able to see more.""Sounds good."We slightly change course to a nearby hill.The hike up it didn't provide much trouble, but I still needed to catch my breath a little bit after it.We look around and see something in the distance."What the hell is that?It's definitely not a hill.""I'm not quite sure.Radio it in.""Erm... Houston, we see something.It's relatively skinny, definitely not a hill and from the distance looks like it isn't natural.What should we do, over?""Wait for instructions, Murray.We'll be back in a moment, over."Mayers and myself sit down on the hill staring at it.It's just a black shade in the distance."HAL, how much more time do we have?""1 hour 13 minutes 22 seconds remaining.""Thanks HAL."Mayers and I look at each other."Think we can make it today?""If Houston gets back to us."We sit for a few more minutes and then hear some static."Murray, Mayers, this is James with Houston.We would like you to approach the object.Be careful, and be ready to hightail it out of there.Out."Mayers and I stand up, and begin the journey to the object.As we get closer, we both stop in amazement."Houston, there is a problem.Over.""Yes?Over.""It seems like someone beat us here.It's a Soviet flag, over.""I'm sorry, can you repeat that, over?""It's an old Soviet flag here.Over.""Return to the ship, and we'll give more instructions soon.Out."I look at Mayers, "Head back now, or explore around here a little bit.""Let's explore a bit."We walk around the flag looking for any other signs of their time here.Suddenly, my foot hits something and I fall over to the ground.After I regain my composure, I turn around to see what I tripped over."Uhh... Mayers, get over here."In a few minutes, Mayers is at my side and we both stare down in amazement.The body of an old Soviet astronaut lies in front of us.I bend down and wipe the dust off of the glass cover, but then I recoil in horror."What the fuck is wrong with him!?"Mayers bends down and examines him closer."Houston, come in now, over.""What is the issue, Mayers?Over.""We decided to explore the area a bit more.We found something else.Over.""What is it, over.""It's the body of one of the Soviet astronauts.Somethings terribly wrong with him.His eyes are black as the night, and it looks like all of his veins turned black as well.Over.""Get out of there, guys.Now.Over.""You don't have to tell us twice, out."Mayers and I start heading back to the ship."Help..." we hear meekly.We both stop dead in our tracks, and whirl around."What the fuck?!"The astronaut has sat up and is staring right at us."Help..." he says again."How the fuck?"I say in shock, "It's time to leave."I turn around but I see Mayers hasn't yet."Mayers!Let's move.This isn't right.He shouldn't be alive.He can't be."Mayers turns to look at me and the first thing I notice is his eyes.They're black.I look over at the old Soviet astronaut and he is back on the ground, dead.Oh fuck no.I start to back up slowly."Mayers... what's wrong.""Nothing, Murray.Why would you think something is wrong.""Erm... your eyes aren't exactly..normal."Mayers starts walking a bit faster towards me."Nothings wrong with my eyes.I see just fine."I hightail it back to the ship, or I try to.Before I know it, Mayers has thrown me to the ground."Where are you going, Murray.""I need to get back to the ship.Inform Houston of what we've found.""That's okay, I'll do it."Suddenly, I see Mayers fist coming down at me, but I can't cover my mask before it hits it.The glass helmet shatters, and instantly I can't breath."Mayers... why..." I choke out."Houston, we have a problem.We need an evac immediately.Murray's helmet has shattered.We're heading back to the ship.Over.""Evac is on it's way.Out."Mayers bends down to me, but I barely recognize it's him because everything is getting so dark.I see him grinning wide, and then barely hear "Thanks."----------------------------------------------------------

Thanks to /u/The_White_Light for explaining they don't actually say "Over and Out," just "Out."
