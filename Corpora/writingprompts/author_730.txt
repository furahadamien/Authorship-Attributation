I heard it speak.Or maybe I felt it.I really don't know.I did understand, however.Sweet nothings mostly, almost like it was seducing me, luring me."You want to live, don't you?""You want for everyone to survive, O wielder mine?"I stopped.I thought, yet I didn't think.What does it mean?What is it asking for?My mind, as always, is empty.One day, however, I hear it screech.A blood curdling scream that could be heard for miles and miles of space, trapped inside my mind."DO IT!"I was in shock.I was cleaning myself after another kill.My brain was aching.I had Taken so many lives, what did it ask from me now?"DO IT!"Each scream started merging with the other, to create a caucophony of deadly voices.And so, I did it.I woke up, my chest agape.But there was no blood.There was no flesh.Only a core of darkness, sitting inside a chasm of light.I look around.There are people.All black and white and evil and lifeless.But they yelled.They yelled my name.They yelled as if I was their savior, as if I had protected them from everything.But they are empty, as I am.Did I kill them?No, of course not.Of course I didn't.They didn't die, they're still alive!I'm still a hero, after all!I am a king!They are my subjects!"It is done."I hear *it* speak once again, but no longer inside my mind."You have changed, O wielder mine."An immense dragon... Or is it?It isn't light and dark, nor is it flesh and blood...Bone.It is made of bone.Yet it is also... A sword.Stronger than life.It has no power, no sharpness, but its words...Fatal."I haven't changed much.I am now a king.""If that is what you say, O king mine."Yes, a king indeed.I take one more look around me.At the dead yet not dead, alive without minds.This is what I wanted.This is what my siblings wanted.This is what *my blade* wanted.I cast away my previous name.What was it?It doesn't matter anyway.I am Oryx.I am powerful.I am a king.I will save everyone.I will *Take* everyone.Yes, this is destiny.The prompt was close enough to the lore that I couldn't help myself from writing the thought process of oryx.
