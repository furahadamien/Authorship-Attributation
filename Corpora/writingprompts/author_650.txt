The walk to the hyper centre to buy groceries was always an enjoyable part of my day.Most people, mind you, would have had their fridges ordering online for them, automatically, selecting the menu solely based on their online history.Most people just sat around all day, being fed information and *fullfillment* while countless AI toiled at production, at least I still got a bit of exercise in my lonely existence.It meant the aisles were quiet.Today was different though.Things were ominously quiet.I strolled through the revolving door, being harassed by a robot shop assistant, insistent she knew what I wanted - better than myself.Little did the bitch know I'd be making sushi for the first time."Would you like me to add a sushi making kit, Mr Miles? "the robot said, hauntingly lifelike."Or did you receive one as a birthday present, from your neighbour Mr Jones?".Otherwise I have a full cart prepared for you, including delicious salmon, sushi ingredients, meals, as well as recipes for your AI helper to follow."I'd rather just walk around myself, thanks," I replied."Let me know if you need anything then!"as she floated away.I was still polite to them, anything else felt wrong, but God damn it I came here to shop, not to collect a delivery.It was at this time that I noticed I was the only person in the place.I couldn't see any human staff, or customers, anywhere.Whatever, maybe there was some cyber game final on or something, who knows what these kids are into these days.And they almost exclusively are young these days.I don't blame them, I'd also stay young if turning back time wasn't an option.I'm one of the few left alive of the previous, and penultimate generation.For my age I was pretty healthy.Well everyone was, actually.Medicine had come a long way, almost no condition was untreatable.Except dementia, which basically gets everyone some extent after a certain age.Unless you have regular epamycinate injections of course.Research into other treatments essentially stopped after the discovery.And hey, who cares I still have a good 20 years left in me with modern medicine.Weird that the place was this empty, though.My pocket vibrates and I reach into my pocket for my phone.Ah, my news app, not some dank memes from an old friend back home, as I'd hoped.The headline caught my attention though, *Epamycinate side-effects discovered*.Interesting I thought as I tapped and began to read."...*their penises begin to shrink at a rate of roughly 1cm per year after, on average, 50 years of treatment.*..." I chuckled to myself even though I knew that scientists could regrow any organ with ease.Small justices.
