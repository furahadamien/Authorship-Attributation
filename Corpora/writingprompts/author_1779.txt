"You look like you've seen a ghost."uttered the familiar figure.Indeed I have.The simple tan coat, red tie, and shoes as spotless as ever."Dad?"I responded."Something wrong?Sorry I took a while."said my "father" in a clueless manner.There truly was something wrong."Where the hell were you!Mom loved you!She at least deserved an explanation!"I shouted.This man who abandoned my mother and I for ten years expected what!A hug and a greeting?Who does he think he is?"Well, son, if you can just calm down for a..." "No!How about you tell me what you were doing for the last decade looking for cigarettes!"I retorted."Ten years!What are you talking about?"the man questioned."Don't act like you don't know!You just went up and left me and mom!""I've been gone for thirty minutes and you're acting like a damn drama queen."he said."Thirty minutes!Look around you!Does it seem like it's been thirty minutes?"I said, pointing towards the interior of the house.He looked around the shell of once a humble home."You know what, just come inside."I held my hand out.There was a moment of hesitation but he held it.Step by step, I led him through the house.He began to notice all the changes around the place, including me."Where did that come from?I guess I have been gone a long time."Well, that was obvious.I asked, calmly this time, "Where were you...Dad?"He seemed unsure yet confidently he said, "I'm telling you, son, all I've done was pick up a few cigarettes."Are you kidding me?All of this time and this is what I get?I pushed onward with my father close behind.I let go of his hand once we've reached the living room."I should really talk to your mot-" "There."I remarked as I pointed towards the urn in the middle of the room."That's who you are looking for."He looked at the urn aghast."Stop fooling around with me, Tom!"he exclaimed at me."Tell me this is a joke!Tell me that this has got to be just another of your stupid pranks, Tom!"He was clearly confused and angered.It took me a moment to realize that this was my dad, but why doesn't he just admit it?I had to live ten years without any answers, and now he's asking me more.I just sat down on the floor and gave up."When you left..." I slowly said."...mom was so much more confused than I was.Now that she's gone, I don't have anyone else."The truth was I missed my dad, despite everything my mother told me.I was broken.I had nothing."But you still have me?Don't you?"whispered my dad.He knelt down next to me."While I don't understand what's possibly going on, I still love you son, and nothing can change that."I was close to tears."Dad, I'm sorry bu..." "Hush."my father said welcoming me to a tight embrace."I'm here now, I'm back from the store."I chuckled a bit.No matter what happened he was still a dad.My dad.I hugged him back.A hug to make-up for the last ten years.END.(15-year-old high school student here.I'm not a native English speaker so please do tell any mistakes I may have done.Thanks for reading!)
