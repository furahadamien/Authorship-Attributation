Then I woke up, to my dismay, allowing the cold and bitter reality creep back in that this was the year.This was the year that she was no longer by my side.How could I let this happen? I asked myself, still buried in a cocoon made from blankets and sheets on the king sized mattress she helped me pay for just a year before.Rolling over to grab my phone, I see no name flash across my screen, instead the same picture of the two of us together last Christmas at her family party stares back at my face.Slowly I open my iPhone and open up my photos to see the stock photos that comes with the phone.Select photo as your new background? 

Yes.
