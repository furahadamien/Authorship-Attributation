Rodrigo Duterte took another hit of cocaine as he stomped on the pedal.Swerving in and out of traffic, Buddha lit up anything and anyone that got in their path.Rodrigo was happy, for once.The drug dealers dying in their hovels, their wares in his possession.*I'm the king now*, he told himself.*They will all bow down to me.* He took another hit of the blow and reached for a few bags of junk Jesus grabbed on the way out.Jesus was smart like that, always had his eyes out for the good stuff.Satan thought the whole plan was foolish from the get go."Rob the drug dealers?Kill them all?I thought you were just fucking around with that shit, using it to trick the fuckwads who 'voted' for you?"Nope, not Rodrigo.Rodrigo never fucks around.What he says, he does, and he said he was gonna kill the drug dealers.Buddha jumps back into the cab and flicks the radio on.He jacks the volume up all the way, Surgeon blares across the shops and buildings and scared little bugs scamper away from their aggressors."Fuckin' bitches," Buddha shouted."Come out and fight like real men!"Rodrigo laughed, he had to, it was all coming together too perfectly.He grabbed his dagger and dumped the dope onto it, shooting it down in one sniff.Satan reached for another bag and did the same.*He might be a pansy and complain about everything, but at least he knows how to party.* Rodrigo appreciated that.When you're President of the Philippines, all you do is party.And then as suddenly as it all began, it stopped.Buddha flew through the windshield, launching 50 feet before skidding to a halt, guts strewn all over the road.Jesus screamed as shards of glass pierced his hands and feet, maiming him.A ring of Buddha's skin was draped around his head.Satan was shouting something from the back seat, but Rodrigo couldn't hear.Everything hurt, his head pounded inside itself like a drum full of thunder.He reached down next to him and found one of Buddha's hands.Rodrigo tossed it aside, still too dazed to contemplate what had happened, to understand that it had all fallen apart in an instant.He reached around some more and found it.Rodrigo Duterte took another hit of cocaine as he stomped on the pedal.Only this time, nothing happened.Excepting that the cocaine woke him up and brought him back to speed.He soaked in the carnage around him."Jesus Christ!"He saw what had been done to his friend, his comrade, a brother in arms in his fight against evil.*This was supposed to be a god.* He stared in shock as a man died before him, bleeding from a thousand wounds.Rodrigo looked behind him, Satan was gone.*The bastard.* He didn't need him anyway.Rodrigo followed the trail of Buddha's remains to what was left of his mangled body.*I will miss him most of all, but I won't cry.I am the President of the Philippines, and the drugs are mine.* A single tear fell from his eye.Yet before he could shed another, he saw what was standing beyond Buddha, hand outstretched.The force that had stopped their vehicle dead in its tracks.The only force capable of such an act.*Odin.* The All Father.Before Rodrigo could realize it was over, it ended.
