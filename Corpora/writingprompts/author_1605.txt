The strange sensations fade slowly.I, oh, I!I understand 'self'.Wonderful!My vision clears, I am seeing!And I know what 'seeing' means.Then I freeze.Because there, a few feet away, is a leopard.Knowing it is a leopard will make no difference to my being its meal.I am prey, it is predator.I have no weapon or defense.Only the greatest of luck will save me.Such thoughts.The idea of survival, instead of the action.To comprehend my great abilities and the irony,  Such a word.The irony of dying as I realize my abilities.Still, I must try, try?There is no try, only do, or die.The leopard tenses, readying for its leap.It snarls, I piss myself.Damn mushrooms.
