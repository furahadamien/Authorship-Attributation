It was loud.Louder than anything I had ever heard.Loud enough to wake me.Disoriented I slowly stir, my head pounding my ears ringing.I can barely open my eyes.My head reels as I search for the loud droning I hear in my head.A loud beep rings coldly from the heart monitor, that unnatural sound that torments me all day and night.But not now.It keeps getting louder.My family didn't visit again, they're never here.I wish I could've seen them one more time.I need something for this headache.I reach my hand out and press the assistance button.The loud buzzing from the button makes it worse.My hand grows weak and the button falls from my hand.It keeps getting louder.I try to reach my hands up, to cover my ears.My face contorts in pain.Tears steam down my face.The sound continues until it grows to be unbearable.My body starts to tingle as I start to shake.I feel cold, feel scared.My vision blurs.It keeps getting louder.It was loud.Louder than anything I had ever heard.Loud enough to wake me.Disoriented I slowly stir, my head pounding, ears ringing.My head reels as I search for the source of the sound.My alarm clock is blaring, that ungodly sound that torments me every morning.But not this morning.It keeps getting louder.I need to head to work, head to the office.I need to do something about this headache.I head towards my window and draw the curtains.The light makes it worse, makes it louder.I stumble towards my door.It keeps getting louder.I fall to my knees, my hands covering my ears.My face contorts in pain.Tears stream down my face.The sound continues until it grows to be unbearable.I collapse onto the ground, I start to shake.I feel cold, feel scared.My vision blurs.It keeps getting louder.It was loud.Louder than anything I had ever heard.Loud enough to wake me.Disoriented I slowly stir, my head pounding, ears ringing.My head reels as I search for the source of the sound.My baby sister is crying, that awful sound that bothers me every night.But not tonight.It keeps getting louder.I have school in the morning, I need to turn in my history paper.I wonder if Mom has something for this headache.She'll be in here soon for my sister.I head towards the door and turn on the light.The light makes it worse, makes it louder.My mom comes in.I stumble towards her.It keeps getting louder.I fall into her arms, my hands covering my ears.My face contorts in pain.Tears steam down my face.The sound continues until it grows to be unbearable.I curl up in her arms, I start to shake.I feel cold, feel scared.My vision blurs.It keeps getting louder.It was loud.Louder than anything I had ever heard.Loud enough to wake me.My eyes open slowly.I hear it all around me.That sound, that ungodly sound that awoke me.I can barely comprehend what's happening, I feel like a lifetime has passed, and yet I can't speak.I try to move but my body wont move.All I can do is cry.Cry and wail for somebody to pick me up, somebody to hold me.It keeps getting louder.The sound of the others.The sound of crying.They're crying for somebody to pick them up, crying for somebody to hold them.
