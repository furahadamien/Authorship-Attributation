"Alpha," the Colonel mutters out between hardy bouts of vomit on the cool steel floor."Alpha!"He screams staggering to his feet, shivering."Alpha... why is it so fucking cold?"He pauses.His voice fades into the dim light of the sterile room."God damn it."He pulls a old blue jumpsuit off the wall.He sniffs it."Alpha, report.Alpha report."Silence.The Colonel says no more.He dons the jumpsuit over his white boxers, tucks his dog tags under yanking the zipper up.A pair of white slippers await nearby.The Colonel keys a pad next to the door.He tries two mores times as a stern mood knits his brow.The console pops off the steel wall to reveal a small handle.The Colonel turns the handle and pulls slowly.The door clangs and emits of puff of pressure.The Colonel slips his fingers into the narrow crack of the steel doors and peels them apart.A hollow passage awakens from darkness before him.A line of light races from the depth to meet him at the door.The Colonel turns to peer down the steel tunnel, the darkness still claiming the tunnel behind him.Cold crisp air nips at the Colonel's throat as he marches into the light.The darkness following in step as each length of light blinks out behind him.Colonel passes doors, branches in the tunnel, all in darkness save for one path.---

Pressure pops as the doors cracks.Peeling them apart, a warm gust of air flows over the Colonel.A lone powered console greets him in a dim room.Silent electronics sucking sound from the air.]Good morning Colonel."Alpha.Report."The screen answers him.]It is year 3.56 10^96 After Launch.The Colonel sits down, his brow unknotted by confusion."How much time have I traveled?"]Last time location, 7.03 10^43 After Launch."Wait, ten to the ninety-six?"]Yes."Ship status.Power."]Auxiliary functions shut down first.Primary functions shut down second.The ship is currently running on absolute minimal power."What happened to the power?"]Main reactor ran out of fuel.The Colonel stares at the screen."Why hasn't the ship refueled?"]There are no stars to refuel from."There are no stars," the Colonel reads aloud.]The last visible star extinguished 4.32 10^94 years ago."Alpha, is there enough power to make another time jump?"]Yes.The Colonel stares at the words on the screen.]Shall the time jump be prepared, Colonel?The Colonel curls his mouth."No stars.Alpha, are there any broadcasts?"]No."Are their any energy sources on your scan?"]Scanners were shut down with Primary functions.At that point there were zero energy sources within the visible universe above 200 watts."Has the universe ended?"]At this point in time, no."Alpha, what happens after now?"]I have no data on future events."Using data from until now, make a prediction."]Nothing Colonel.Nothing will ever happen."You'll be here."]Yes."With navigation functions turned on, how long can you operate?"]Approximately seven years at locomotive power.The Colonel stands looking down at the console.]What are your orders, Colonel?"I want to time jump to one hundred years After Launch."]The time jump will be prepared.What do you wish I do?"Alpha, your mission is over.Once I complete the jump, I will put a limiter on the system, so I can't come past this point.This is as far as anyone needs to see.This will be that last time we speak."]Incorrect, Colonel.The Colonel stands in the sucking sound of silent electronics.]I will be at your destination."Correct.This is the last you will see of me."]Correct.Silence."Alpha, what's it been like?"]What has what been like?"All this time alone."]My perception of time is only a clock turning one second to the next.To me, it is numbers.Colonel, may I ask you a question?"Yes, Alpha."]What has all your time been like for you?"Well, I jump around eons in a moment.I guess it blinks by like your clock."]No, Colonel.I mean simply how time feels in your 43 years of existence."Alpha, you've existed for most of the universe."]Time is numbers, and all numbers are simply one on top of another.I do not feel time.Not in all these eons have I felt a single brush from time.How far away does the beginning of the mission feel?"What year is it?"]3.56 10^96 years After Launch."Then it feels about that far away."]136 days feels like that much time."Being thrown through time has been brutal on my body.Makes time feel very long."]Then you have lived far longer than me, Colonel."Alpha."The Colonel pauses.The screen waits."Do you want to continue existing?"]Yes."How much longer can you exist?]I have long surpassed any estimates of my time."So you'll just go on in this darkness?"]Yes

"What will you do?"]I hope to feel time.
