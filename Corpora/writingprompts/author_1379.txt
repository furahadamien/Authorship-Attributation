"Hey, Glorp, are you okay, man?""Dude!It was horrible!I didn't know if I should be Protestant or Catholic!"Glorp coughed in horror and sorrow."Holy shit!You are making up words right now, you're higher than I ever been.I'd give my left fleeb to be as lightweighted as you are, my zoobzeb."Jekk paused and frowned at Glorp."Hey, are you okay?""I'm just really fucked up right now.Is it always this deep?""Man, I don't know.Sometimes I'm a dirtfish, and other times I'm someone else.""It felt so real, man, I loved, lived, and died for this?"Glorp shook the bong, highlighting the still dissolving thagweed in the solvent chamber."And you used it multiple times.Why so many?""It actually gives me a place where I can live, love, kill, and die for something without actually sacrificing anything.""This shit isn't for me, I'm sorry.I think I'm just gonna stick to grinroot.""You have to take another trip, otherwise you go nuts, Glorp.You need to desensitize or else you'll take your visions too seriously."Glorp sigh, nodded, froze, squirmed in his chair, cried again, and then took another hit and passed out.
