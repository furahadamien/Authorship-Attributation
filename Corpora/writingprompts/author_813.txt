"We choose to go to earth and do the other things!Not because they are easy, but because they are haaaad!"The lights cut off and the figure on the podium whirls and dramatically exits, stage left.Oscar starts pestering me."Did you get that?Pleeease tell me you got the shot" 

i make a placating gesture."Calm yo tits Oscar.I got the shot."Turns out people who die literally DO bring it with them when they go, as long as they were holding it at that exact moment.I have no clue who brought this video camera to hell, but DAMN he had taste.As im fiddling with settings, i see a face approaching us through the dispersing throng.Still wearing the shades and that AWFUL hawaian shirt.I tap Oscar on the shoulder and point.His face lights up and he goes bounding over."Mr. Thompson old boy, how did yours go?"Hunter takes a long drag as he holds up his notepad and grins."Extra extra read all about.Julius caesar joins war to escape hell."He angles his notepad so Oscar can see."What should the headline be though?"They muse in unison.I raise a hand."Clash of the titans.Jfk and julius caeser out-speech hitler"

Oscar gives a very british hmm....and fingers his ruffles thoughtfully."I dont DISlike it.Run it by Tupac in editing.He has a way with provacative headlines"

Hunter looks around."We're all here.Old man Dazai stayed at the office today, so now we're just missing..."

Theres a sound effect and a plume of smoke behind us and we all jump 10 feet."You are missing I!Ishikawa Goemon!"Oscar snaps at him."Ive told you to stop doing that!"Ishi bows."My apologies, Wilde-dono, but i couldnt resist."I hope i formatted this right.Ive never done a WP on reddit before
