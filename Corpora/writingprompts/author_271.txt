When the voices first started echoing in my head, I thought I'd just finally gone insane.I was pinned underground during the first wave.The city was annihilated, buildings crumbled, and millions died.I don't know how long I was trapped in the dark before the voices started; I was so lonely I just wanted to hear her voice again.What I heard instead were voices full of regret and longing for the things and people they had lost.I couldnt make the voices go away and when they started dwindling I began to panic, because I knew I'd be alone again.In desperation I reached out for her and there she was or what was left of her.Then I really did go insane.I don't remember much during the second wave, ships the size of cities descended from the sky like snowflakes falling.It was so quiet and I just wandered through the rubble holding her, we were going to have kids, we were going to grow old together, and now I can't even find a place to bury her.That's when I saw my first aliens; they kind of looked like a mix between a giant lobster and a saxophone.I swear one was laughing at me, but it didn't laugh very long before it started screaming.I guess it was screaming, but it may have just been the air escaping.I'll hand it to them, the rest of them didn't hesitate they hit me with everything they had and took off an arm, but they died easier than the first one.As I reattached my arm I woke up to what was happening, not just to the earth, but to me.I could manipulate matter, or rather I could command it and I was growing stronger.Months and maybe years passed before the third wave started and during that time I found some other humans, they had become like me, but different.One of them could even stop time, but she could not go backwards, so it didnt matter.We were the third wave and we were unstoppable.I could almost feel sorry for those poor creatures we slaughtered, but everything I had known was gone; even my pity and compassion were just strange memories.She was gone and no one left could hold a candle to her.None of them had given up everything for me, none of them were carrying my child, and none of them could forgive me for not being there; though some tried.Now that it's over I still don't understand what happened; Alien invasion, apocalypse, or maybe Im stuck in some kind of nightmare.I cant go back, I cant go forward, and I cant die.All I can do is sit here and wait.I dont even know what Im waiting for.
