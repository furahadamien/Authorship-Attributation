When the government finally legalized the drug called Victus, you can bet that I was upset.I was 28 for Gods sake!Still in the prime of my life and no idea why I had to be excluded from immortality just over a 2 year difference.There were riots on the streets of D.C. for my part, I organized the gathering of a few dozen covens and together we tried our hand at casting spells to compel lawmakers into allowing anyone of any age the opportunity to take the drug.I was a hardcore devil worshipping witch back then.I guess the lack of results from our coven gathering made me rethink my beliefs.I became a white witch, and started a YouTube channel to share my knowledge.It never really took off, either until maybe twenty years later.Still, even then, most followers always wanted to know about demons and paranormal encounters.My focus had always been more on the power of the self to manifest reality-and you can see now why my channel never really took off.I had a whole community of haters, people professing their intense disappointment of me as a waste of human potential and a disgrace to real witchcraft.YouTube fame was just not in the cards for me either, I had very quickly found out.I just lived my life quietly, getting a very generous social security check from the government(a nice unexpected perk of mortality).I worked as a nurse-so I mean I wasnt some bum leaching off the government.I grew up, grew older, celebrated each year as if it could be my last.I remained a self-professed witch for my whole life and was pleased to see that it became the trademark of the immortals(I liked to kid myself that my lately burgeoning YouTube channel had helped influence this trend.).Around the time I reached 84 however, the news came alive with the most disturbing news I had encountered.They reported it as the end-times, the apocalypse.Disturbing cases of demonic attacks everywhere across the country.I gasped as I saw a woman with gashes across her stomach (a gorgeous, desperate immortal woman).She was crying about being attacked in her own home while she was asleep.She had seen these grotesque figures as they hurt her, and ran into the streets.This was happening to immortals across the nation, and all of them were saying that something was causing serious injury to immortals.Something dark and twisted.There were a lot of apparent suicides on the day I turned 84.I couldnt understand it.Over the next few weeks the hospitals became overburdened with people.I went to YouTube to find out the actual truth.An immortal man was filming his room.This shit is so fucking scary, Ive been sleeping with the lights on, Ive got motion detectors-and theyve been going off randomly.You might even hear it during this video. The man was pacing in his room, massaging his face in obvious distress.This is the end times guys.Fucking serious, we didnt believe in the Christian bible, well we fucking shouldve because Satan is loose, and his demons are here to torture us.See!Did you guys see it?! The man pointed to an empty corner in the room.I heard it talking to me, whispering.It was saying Conner its your fault, you thought you were god.  Conner pointed to the corner again.You guys are seeing it right?!Right?!?!So fucking scary!!  He was sobbing.I couldnt see anything.And in the comments, no one else could either.Did you hear the motion detector go off guys?!  Conner looked at the camera pleadingly.He grabbed a knife and I shrieked as he HELD THE BLADE, pointing the handle at the corner of the room menacingly, lopping off his fingers.It took him awhile to notice, and when he did he hardly seemed to register it, focusing back on the corner of the room, as if his focus was enough to deter the threat.YouTube had to shut down after that.Too many people committed suicide on livestream, claiming the demons were killing them.After that, all social media sites also shut down.Hope you enjoy!
