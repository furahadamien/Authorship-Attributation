Sternsson
"Look, I like you kid, but some of the things on this resume just doesn't make sense."Colonel Chaos leaned back in his thick pandaskin armchair, removing his reading glasses in the progress.If this affected the scrawny young man on the other side of the giant mangroove desk, he did a good job not showing it."I'm not sure I understand?I have a flawless record.I took down Mr Amazing last month, and that is more than most of my classmates can ever hope to achie..."

The old Colonel had started massaging his temples."I'm gonna stop you right there son.I just don't think you are a good fit for this evil organisation."The young mans face had begun looking strained from the effort of trying not to look strained.He pulled a wad of papers from the suitcase that rested on his knees, and started to methodically look through them."I pulled some data from your internal servers.According to this, you haven't actually killed a hero in years.Always letting them go, either by incompetence, or by just... letting them go.I am more then 300% effective than even your top villian.Maybe even yourself."Colonel Chaos just looked at the young man with deep, sunken eyes before uttering "Walk with me."He got up from his armchair with great effort and grunting, and went for the door.The young man collected his papers and followed.The walk took them through sleek, metal covered corridors.Traditional, but functional."Look son.I built this organisation.Back when I was Lieutenant Chaos.Didn't have Missus Chaos gnagging about blood preassure and cholesterol either."He slapped his considerable belly with a laugh."No.We don't have many hero kills on record, kid.As a matter of fact, no evil organisation does.Whats your name again son?"The young man looked confused, and he didn't even try to hide it."John."He said."And there it is, John.I read your resume.I read your letter.I even read your profile.You are very efficent.Clean.""Thank you Captai..."

The Captain kept talking, ignoring John entierly."You don't monologue.You don't make fatal mistakes.You don't let the heroes get away.Hell, I reckon you don't even tell them your plans.""No, I find that a bit outdated.Archaic.""I'm sure you do son."They entered a large chamber.Brightly lit with two doors in each end of the room.The wall tiles looked white and clean.In the middle of the chamber sat a group of well known heroes and villians around a large conference table."Greetings fellas" Captain Chaos did a sloppy salute with two fingers and pulled out a chair from the table."Have a seat kid."The young man was stunned."You let heroes in here?What is this?""Take.A.Seat."Captain Chaos demeanor had changed entierly, and you could see glimpses of the world infamous mastermind through his old eyes.The young man complied.The Captain bellowed out across the room."The Council is in session!"The young man looked visibly confused and perplexed.He met the eyes of the various villians and heroes.The Captain continued."This is John.Aspiring Villian.This is the young man that killed Mr Amazing and his entire family.One of my dearest friends and many of yours as well."The Council murmured in agreement."Friends and collegues.Tell me.A villian that kills without remorse, with no respect for the traditions and showmanship we have built over the year, that is efficent above all else, what would you call that villian?"The old hero known as Lightstrike stood up, shaking with anger, and yelled."HE'S A FUCKING SERIAL KILLER.""Language Lightstrike."The Captain interjected."But yes.That is correct.You see us villians and heroes have an understanding.Neither of us go too hard, we don't kill eachother.Not on purpose, anyway.That way, we get our companies and syndicates left alone, and the heroes get to keep their status and influence."The colonel closed in behind the young mans chair."And you see son.We like our status quo.We don't want to... stir the pot."And in one swift motion, he snapped the young mans neck backwards, threw him out of the chair, and on to the floor.A panel slid open to reveal a floor mounted furnace, that promptly incinerated the lifeless body."That would be all Gentlemen."The Colonel nodded to the assembly.
