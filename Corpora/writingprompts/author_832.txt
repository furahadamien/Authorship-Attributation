"Please don't do this."Couldn't be much older than 19.She'd do, though, he'd already decided, as he gagged the infernal noise that constantly came from her mouth.That was the thing about girls her age.Always so whiny, so demanding.Well, he'd show them what happens to the whiners.He heard a skittering noise, but brushed it off.The place was empty, who knows what kind of creatures--

Then he saw it.Just beyond the crying girl.A spider.Big one, too.The thing that creeped him out was that it had stopped and seemed to be looking at him.He felt the hairs on his legs stand up.Wait, no, that was...He looked down.Spiders!Hundreds of them, climbing up his body, crawling under his clothing, all over him, he fell to the ground trying to shake them off.But their numbers only grew.The sensation, the itch of all those tiny legs, the bites all the bastards were giving hi--

He saw one drop onto his face.A black widow.*Oh god, oh god, oh god...*

This bite registered to him more so than the others, and he closed his eyes to await the stopping of all the sensations.Meanwhile, Hadley had struggled enough with her hastily tied ropes to free herself, pulling off the gag, looking around her in surprise.She recognized the biggest spider."Baby?"The first spider she'd ever saved, the first one she'd set free.She'd been 9 years old and too grown-up to be scared of spiders, thank you very much.So she'd developed a liking to the large one that ran around her room, calling it Baby and bringing it small scraps she'd hoped it would like (She didn't know much about spider diets).When her dad had first seen Baby, he'd wanted to kill it.She refused and carefully eased Baby outside into the backyard and watched it leave.Now, Baby was back with the countless other spiders that she had rescued over the years, albeit reluctantly.The black widow was the most terrifying save of her life.She'd apologized, too, for being so clinical and so rushed to get her out, rather than kind and cautious as she had with many others.And now, here they were, and she remembered her fond words to Baby as a child."Today you, tomorrow me."
