I couldnt believe it.I had always been a lucky kid.Once, I entered a raffle at my local Welborns Grocery Store for a Tide Racing jacket and won.I was only 8 years old and the jacket was way too big for me but I loved that thing.This time at Welborns it was a lifetime supply of Oreos.And I absolutely adored Oreos.So even though I slipped in as many raffle tickets as I could fill out, slightly tipping the odds in my favor...I was still in utter disbelief as a 10 year old slightly overweight kid when my parents told me the store called and I won another raffle for a lifetime supply of Oreos.That Tide jacket got a lot of use later in life, especially after the incident.It was always cold now, and now I was 44.I was extremely thankful that this was an adult sized jacket because I had grown into it, and without it I may not have lived this long in the first place.The warmth and size of the jacket had saved my life many times.This isnt the story of my jacket however.This is the story of the Oreos.The incident happened when i was 14, no one in my area knows exactly what happened, we were awoken in the dead of night to a very bright light that filled the darkness brighter than the sun for a solid hour.After that hour the light was gone and we havent seen a ray of sunshine since.No electricity has ever worked since either causing many rumors about an Electro-Magnetic Pulse or something else that I have no idea about.At that time I was terrified.My parents had no idea what to do and since I was an only child and supremely spoiled, I was soft.The first few years were hell.I lost both my parents and had to grow up extremely quickly.I had to become hard.I had to do things and make decisions no child ever should.However the one thing that always remains are these Oreos.Ive travelled many miles and many states worth of distance since the incident.Everywhere I go everything is always the same.Only people under 20 years of age when the incident happened are still alive today.Things are pure chaos and I have to fight every day to stay alive and to keep my Oreos.The Oreos.The Tide Racing Jacket.The two things that have kept me alive and trucking in such a bleak existence.No matter where I go, or what I do the boxes just keep coming.And it is my mission in life to figure out who gets them to me and where they come from.If I can figure this out and solve this conundrum maybe, just maybe I can save the world.I cant believe it.
