Sometimes I wonder how much our lives remember about the others, I mean surely I couldn't be this stupid.Even as a twelve year old none of us have ever been foolhardy enough to think jumping off a roof in an attempt to fly would be a good idea.Sure we've wondered if the ability was hidden, but we weren't stupid enough to try it.Sitting in the movie theater I glanced around to see a rainbow of me's.We were all different in our own ways, in all manner of colors and shapes, but we all had the same basic facial structure and personality.They all stared in abject horror as little 10 yr. old us gazed over the edge of the roof wearing a cape and a bike helmet."Don't jump you idiot!""Trust us!If none of us can fly, you can't either!"Their shouts were in vain as she threw her cape back and plunged off the roof.All at once we were pulled into her consciousness and watched as we plunged toward the rocks in the flower bed below.*Craaaack!* We were fading between her mind's eye and the theater; I wasn't in the mood to die today, but oh well.It's not like someone else wasn't ready for their turn at life.Suddenly  we, I, felt a rush of urgency.*This is not our last life, but it is the last one we have to save the world.I need all of you.Stay with me*
