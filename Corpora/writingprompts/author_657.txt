Funny how much difference 2 years can make in a person.I remember when they first announced that "Jiaogulan" was going to be put on the shelf for commercial consumer use.Some Thai Scientists cracked the genetic code for aging only downside, I was 28.During Human trial testing anyone over the age of 26 who consumed the drug were prone to hallucinations, vomiting, and severe cardiac distress.Simply put it was considered unethical to allow anyone past the cut off to use the medication, life continued its impending march of age for Me and the rest of the "Antiques" as the Immortals so affectionally put it, as if they dont give us enough hell already.Anyways im rambling...as i tend to do alot at this age, Oh!Of course thats what i was leading up to, today is my birthday, im 87.Its been 2 years since the side effects of "Jiaogulan" began to arise and truthfully its been pretty nice because now they need us!Thats right!The whole damn lot of them!Ageless litle brats cant even step outside into direct sunlight without 100 percent coverage of their bodies.Their bodies have become extremely reliant on Iron which has made them resort to constant blood transfusions.Their Canine teeth have lenghtened to an extreme degree along with their fingernails.The most regrettable part is they are now all barren and impotent no longer able to produce anymore children, But at least they'll never age i suppose.Now us Old Geezers are their caretakers, its good to feel needed again even if its forced upon them.
