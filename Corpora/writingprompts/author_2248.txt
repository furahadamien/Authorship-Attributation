He have reason to believe life has once existed here, long before us, not just any life however, intelligent life.From the years of excavations and searching, we have come this conclusion.Fortunately we have found skeletons of the life that once lived here, and as such and DNA traces as well.When compared to the advanced life forms who call themselves Terrans the DNA is extremely similar, when compared with their history the story of this planet we have since dubbed Terra Originis.

According to their history records Terra Originis used to host countless numbers of organisms until an unknown event occurred causing the atmosphere to vaporize killing almost all inhabitants.The Terrans however sought to colonize another planet in hopes of surviving elsewhere.Carbon dating testing shows the skeletons are older than our entire species, in retrospect it makes sense considering how much advanced the Terrans are compared to us.Our leaders in attempts to repair recently broken relationships with the empire of Terra have proposed to make the planet suitable for life once more, its possible but it will require help from them.They have agreed, but not all of them, its what the Terrans do best, they fight amongst themselves and split into factions, all for no reason, it matters not however.We need their secrets at all costs, we saw them turn the planet Selvack from a wasteland into a paradise, perhaps we could learn that too.
