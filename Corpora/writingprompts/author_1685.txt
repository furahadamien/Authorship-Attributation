Living beyond my means always seemed not only unnecessary to me, but pointless.Sure, I could do whatever I wanted and be whatever I wanted, but I had seen what money could do to people and those around them.I didn't want to be another chump with "yes men" around me telling me how good of a job I was doing, regardless if I actually was.So when I won the lottery, I kept quiet.Not only did I not tell my friends, but I didn't even tell my family.Instead, I retained a lawyer and financial advisor and just invested.Before I knew it my bank account just grew and grew until I was worth $140 billion dollars.When it came to my day to day life, I tried to keep i simple and I never saw a reason to stop doing what I loved.I mean hell, I was lucky.How many people can say that do what they love every day when they go into work?And keeping my secret from co-workers was easy.When I went on vacation to Paris, it was seen as completely normal.What they didn't know what I took a private jet there, stayed in a suite at the Four Seasons and ate at Michelin star restaurants each night.For a moment, my life felt perfect--but all good things must come to and end.That end was Craig.He was the new creative director at my agency and from the moment I met him, I knew I didn't like him.For one, he had no talent.He didn't get to where he was based off of his work or ability to lead a team, he got there because he was bully that knew how to manipulate those around him.I wasn't one of those people and I saw straight through his act.It didn't take long for me to realize that as soon as Craig joined my team, he had set his sights on me.His goal was to destroy my career and turn everyone against me.He started by criticizing my work and rewriting every single word and sentence I showed him.His ideas were moronic and off strategy, but since he was the boss no one had the guts to call him out on it.When I did call him out, all the others would shrink down in their seats and look away.No one dared tell the boss he had a bad idea and boy was Craig going to make sure I paid for disagreeing with him.It started with little things.Like that deadline I could have sworn was Wednesday was suddenly Monday.Or files would go missing from the server.With time it grew and grew until suddenly mistakes were being made that required the team to work over the weekend and I was being blamed.It was so obvious, I don't know how I didn't see it coming.It was a Friday morning when Craig called me into a last minute meeting.When I walked into the conference room, there sat HR, alone at the table with a folder.Craig's face went serious and as I sat down and told me that he was sorry but I "just wasn't the right fit here".HR then explained to me that my time with the agency was terminated and they would ship my belongings to my home address.I stood up, trying to hold back the tears in my eyes and Craig smiled.He smiled as if to say, "I won" and before I could say a word, HR led me out the door and out the office.For months I sat at home and dwelled on what happened.I tried to piece together what happened and how it got to the point where they would fire me.As I began to sort through all of the events that had unraveled I began to see the connection: Craig.Every step forward I'd make, he'd ensure I took two steps back.Well, little did Craig know that is screwed with the wrong girl.Not only was he going to pay for what he did, but everyone at the agency was going to pay for following him blindly.The account I worked on was the largest client the agency had before, it was worth millions of dollars.So naturally, the best way to destroy a tumor is to cut off it's blood supply.So I bought the client, the entire company, under an alias name.The next step was to hire a chairman and CEO that would act as an instrument to my plan.My team privately met with dozens of candidates and it didn't take long for me to appoint someone to head up the company that ensured me he'd follow my direction without question.In the meantime, I found another job.In fact, it was a better job with a title and pay increase that I may have not needed, but at least demonstrated they saw my value.Each day I'd come home from work and communicate with my team and CEO, directing them on steps they needed to take to ensure the success of the company.First being--fire all of the advertising agencies they had partnered with.For one particular ad agency, however, I requested the CEO personally deliver the news to the creative team himself.I told him to handle the process as he saw fit but there was one thing he needed to say upon termination: "I'm sorry, but you're just not the right fit here."It didn't take long for news to spread about the great loss and changes within the client's organization and within about a year, after losing their largest client, the agency closed.Eventually, that agency became a distant memory and I was happily promoted at my job, working as a creative director for a place I loved.It was early fall when a resume came across my desk with a familiar name and a huge gap in employment history.He had already been through 2 interviews earlier that week and I was the last point of contact as the hiring manager.I gleefully saw the calendar invite pop onto my computer and that afternoon I walked to the conference room where candidates waited to meet with their potential employers.I pushed open the door and Craig looked up.His smile quickly disappeared and he went as pale as a ghost as he saw me standing at the door.I had recently gotten married and he had not realized who I was since my last name had changed.I smiled brightly and without a word sat down in front of him.He stuttered as he opened his portfolio book and began to quietly go over his work with me, conveniently skipping over the work from the agency we had worked at together not so long ago.I quietly listened and as he paused to take a breath.I leaned forward, looking at him directly in the eye and smiled."You know what, Craig", I said, "I'm sorry, but you're just not the right fit here."&#x200B;
