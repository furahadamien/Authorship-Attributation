How strange to think that the Lord of Death would grow tired of itself.When the War first began, I had set to work as I always had during times of great conflict and plague.I searched out each victim as I felt their lives expire, collected their poor lost souls, and brought them to their new home.It was just another war, I told myself.For a short time, I almost believed it.But on some level, I knew it was more than that.Id learned that lesson during the last big one, though Id tried so hard to forget.It was never just a war.My job was to escort the poor lost souls from this world to the next.As the Lord of Death itself, I exist wherever life ends, and nothing ends life quite like a war.Contrary to popular belief, I never steal life.I never take what it not rightfully mine.Or at least, thats what I used to think.So many lives ended in that old war.I had been everywhere at once, in the same place hundreds of times at once.So many souls had cried out to me to take them away from those horrors, and I could do nothing but wait.The souls came to me when life ended, and I led them to their new home, all the while waiting for the other souls that would surely follow.There are countless lives, but there is only one Death.I do not weep for the dead, for that would only be useless self-pity.I do not feel sadness anyway, not in the way the mortals do.ButI think that was the first time in my existence that I felt truly tired.Life ends suddenly sometimes, and earlier than it should.That has always been the Way of things, and I am not one to question the Way.But thatit was just too much.I had hoped  foolishly, I knew  that another war would never come.But war was the way of the humans.There were so many of them, wanting different things but also the same things.I had tried so hard to deny its inevitability.I know they did too.We were all fools.It had started suddenly, though its coming was hardly unexpected.I think that was the worst part; at some point, all those souls had silently accepted my coming, and lived for so long knowing I was right there, over their shoulder, or waiting for them around the next corner.For many of them, I looked them right in the eye before I took them away.I looked them in the eye and I stole their life away.I, Master of Death, who always swore I was no thief, stole the lives of millions in a day.And I stole the lives of hundreds of millions more in a year.Within two years I had stolen billions.I wept for none of them.I wished I could.Officially, I dont think it ever ended.I took most of their leaders, after all.There was no one left to make that decision.Those that remained had other worries now.Their souls still came to me when I found them, as they always had, and each time I was amazed.These souls were strange, to say the least.Each era of life was different, the souls each greeting me differently.In the age before humanity, they hardly greeted me at all, were hardly even aware of my presence.The souls just before the War had felt no fear when I came to them, often greeting me coldly, as if they had expected me to come for them sooner.During the War, the souls screamed in terror at the sight of me, as wartime souls often did.But after, the souls I guided ran to me like lost and frightened children searching for their parent.As if I was a refuge.I couldnt understand it.It was not the Way of life to desire Death.There were always outliers, sure, but never this.I couldnt stand for it.There were too few left, and I needed them to continue my own existence.There would be no need for Death if there was nothing living left to die.For the first time that I could remember, I feared my own existence.If all life ended, I would end as well.I, Death itself, did not want to die.Something needed to be done.I didnt change all at once.I stopped coming only to those whose souls were leaving this world, and began to visit those whose lives were about to end early.I had never taken an active role like this, and I did not want to interfere too much; much as I feared myself, I still worried about upsetting the Way of things.At first I only helped those dying of infectious diseases, humans whose frail bodies could no longer fight off the bacteria or parasites that had invaded them.I used my power to end the blights infecting plants that humans and remaining animals needed for survival.They were still dying of viruses and the effects of the irradiated landscapes, but at least now they would still have food.I thought just doing that little bit would be the end of it though.I didnt anticipate the feeling that I could  should  do something more.I killed the diseases before they killed them, and before they killed their food sources, but I couldnt escape the feeling that it wasnt enough.I didnt want to upset the Way of things, but I could no longer simply be Death and let their souls come to me.I had to do something more.So, I started killing the cancerous cells that grew in their bodies.It was strange, killing an organisms individual cells.The microbes that sometimes killed larger creatures did not have what I would strictly call a soul. I could feel the life in them, but it had no thought, no feeling, no awareness of itself; it was simply possessed of a driving need to survive.However, these cells, while still not really having that soul themselves, contained a sort of imprint of that soul, like the distant echo of whispered voice in an empty room.I shivered with each one I snuffed out.I could not do much to help those infected by powerful viruses, seeing as my power had little effect on something with so little life in it.It aggravated me, but it was simply the Way of things.I wished I could do more for their lives, but at least their fellows could care for them, and I helped keep them as healthy as I could.Life slowly began to adapt to its changed world.New generations had been born, and maybe one day there would be those who could survive in this poisoned world without my help.How long that would take, I did not know.But it gave me some comfort.I resolved to continue helping them wherever I could.(*continued in comments*)
