I stared at the street for a few seconds, before craning my neck the other way, empty, not that I expected anything else of course, Monday nights being what they were, by which I mean, fucking boring.I sighed and dug into my pocket before pulling out my phone, the least I could do was to keep up with the news.Oh, who am I kidding, I was just browsing Reddit on my phone, hey, being a bouncer in a small town is boring, so sue me.I was lazily reading the comments in some r/science post when I heard the bar's door open, probably my boss, since the last costumer left a couple of hours ago."Hey Ken" I heard him say, "I'm gonna start locking the place up, care to help?"I pocketed the phone and turned around, "Sure Bo-" oh fuck.Right above his head, his number had changed from 43 earlier this day, to 0043.Luckily, he had decided to not give a fuck about my answer, and so he didn't see my bewildered face.But, what could have caused his number to change?Aliens?, Vampires?, Voodoo?, Some other supernatural bullshit??I decided to immediately investigate, so I took out my phone, and that's when I saw the answer.The article where I was reading the comments had something to do with Gene Therapy, or something, I don't really know, I only read the title and the comments.What, you expect me to have read the article?In Reddit?
