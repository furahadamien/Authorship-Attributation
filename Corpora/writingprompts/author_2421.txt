I'm pleased to make your acquaintance, just as I'm sure you are to make mine.After all, I'm well known as one of the great aesthetes of history.And very rich, very influential.Everyone who is anyone owes quite a bit to me.What most don't know when they first meet me is just exactly who I am.You see, I've been around a long, long time, and destroyed more adversaries than you will ever know.Of course, I do get credit for that sometimes, but it's usually for things I have little to do with.Oh, the absurd things people blame me for!Not that I care one way or the other.Sure, I admit I have quite an ego.I'm notorious for it.But not around my villainy.I'm in it for the win, not the glory, and I usually win.My greatest conquests are unknown, like dirty little rackets with your average corrupt street cop, or robbing poor travellers on back roads in third world countries.Ah, those years in India picking off innocents, what good times!Now, I won't be falsely humble: There are certainly a few adventures of mine you might know of.The Kennedy assassination.The rise of the the Third Reich, and also the Soviet Union.I even managed to have a small hand in the crucifixion of Jesus.Oh, yes!I know I seem young and vigorous, but the truth is I'm very old.So if we meet in person, please show me some courtesy and maybe have a bit of sympathy for this old villain.That's not a request, but a demand, even a threat: Use all your well-learned politesse, or I will lay your soul to waste.But never mind that.As I was saying: I'm pleased to meet you.I hope you guessed my name.
