Maj would never shut up.Not when we were children play-fighting with moss covered sticks in the woods.Not when our parents would sit down for dinner and ask about my day.Not in the classroom when I was the one called on by Teacher Latke.He would always jump in with a glistening smile and a resounding speech.My presence vanished at the first crack of that smile.I was never to speak while he was always to be heard; he liked it that way.Today was no different.A book of the ugliest sort was perched on an altar at the center of the Great Hall.Dilapidated pews were packed together; each of them facing the gaudy purple brick, and the decorated man standing beside it.I meandered through the crowd and took a seat.I glanced at those around me.I wanted to find doubt: a skeptical smirk, a condescending scoff, even a nervous jumping knee.Anything that would show me that these people weren't really buying it.Yet the truth was unavoidable.Their eyes were transfixed; their heads swayed to and fro in a struggle for a clear view of the altar.Next to the glistening purple brick, stood my brother.The look on his face told me that he wasn't present in this giant dusty room like the rest of us.He was raised high above the rafters.A swarm of eyes stuck to him and sent him higher with every passing second.Everything he had always wanted, companionship, attention, and praise had coalesced in this Great hall every Tuesday night for the last 6 years.Maj, like most of his followers, transcended, and even ignored, reality when he was among the pews.Yet for Maj, the greatest part of it all was that I had become his foil.For all the praise, attention and reverence he absorbed I was met with coldness, disgust and banishment.I dared to blaspheme the \*great\* prophet.The people would whisper that his mighty holiness was cursed with a jealous brother.I, the unholy brother, was lacking.Lacking in faith, reason, and divine connection and that was why I lied.They did not know that I saw him dig up the book.I knew that the golden wrinkled hand of Kane Tanaka, the oldest person alive, did not reach down from the sky to pass him the holy pages.I knew that the worlds tallest man did not pluck stars from the night and grind them in his palm so he could sprinkle their dust on the purple book cover.It was all nonsense.There was no massive man, no stardust, no golden wrinkled skin.I know the truth and it has made me an outcast.Today my brother will preach about the will of the eldest man.He will preach of the secrets of the worlds strongest, tallest, smartest, and smallest.Their stories will fill the air like the dust.Then, at the height of his sermon, when the hall is silent and anticipation boils, the closing words will dance across his lips and his entranced victims will obey without thought."Donate to the Church of Guinness, my friends, and the elder may grant you a place in the next Holy book."
