There was nothing but the cold darkness at first.Then things began to move quicker, as always.My mind sped up, my eyes adjusted, my muscles began to listen again - and at that moment, I could feel something hovering, quivering near my temple.It was floating there so strangely, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out what had happened.Me and my men - Army's first superhuman squad, second section - had just engaged the enemy when, all of a sudden, everything had seemed to just... stop.No sound, no bright white light, nothing.I thought at first this must be what dying is - so fast that no one, not even *I*, could ever see it coming.And then I realized, as the sound of the gun being fired and the sensation of bullet starting to push into my temple registered, that no one else would have.My hand almost moved on it's own and, with two nimble fingers, pushed the bullet out in front of my face.It was always difficult to stop something already in motion at this speed, so I had to go for the next best thing.The thing slowly crawled into my field of vision, death in such a tiny package, and after a moment of shock I looked to my left to see what exactly had happened.The battlefield had completely stopped, it'd seemed.Bullets and beams of light whizzed through the air, soldiers screaming with no words and dying in a moment.Blood sprinkled forth from wounds and speckled the air surrounding them.Some of my men were using their abilities.Broadside was throwing a punch, Radar was doing his thing in the ditch, and Bay was... knelt down praying.Wish I coulda smacked him, dunce.Then I noticed the man in camo, prone on the ground just feet away.His eyes opened wide in my time.*So it's him,* I thought.*He must've seen us getting busy earlier and decided it was best to take me out.* I couldn't blame him, either.My power was something special, apparently - one in a million, something hard to predict.That's how I got to command this little group of mine, being hard to predict.Of course, nobody ever tells you about drawbacks when you sign up for this shit.My vision blinked out for a second, and the brutality around me returned.The bullet whizzed by and struck the dirt.Screams and explosions rose, the dying died, and I consciously cranked the speed back up until I'd returned to our little moment.There was a limit on how long I could use my power.Bursts of speed for about ten to fifteen seconds, depending on how long I pushed.Any more and I'd be signing my own death warrant.Of course, the man in my house couldn't have known that.By the time I'd gotten back, he'd appeared to have readied his pistol for a shot into Broadside.Bad choice, in my opinion - it wouldn't have done much, even at point blank, with that shitty little peashooter of his.I noticed how sluggish I felt when I tried to move, but I got used to it fast.Kinda necessary to learn how to adjust on the fly with these abilities.I scrambled over to the man and tried to throw a punch, but he noticed me and dove well out of the way.I turned to face him again, but the quickness left me again, left me in the world of other men.I closed my eyes and willed myself back into the quiet, still existence, but pain wracked my head and I felt like something had started stirring up my insides.My lip felt wet, and I wiped it to find a spot of blood.I was on the ground, laid out from a punch.The guy must not have wanted to take the chance of shooting me with a slow bullet again and opted to take a cheap shot and reposition.I'd do the same, honestly.I got to my feet and searched as quickly as I could.The man hadn't gotten far, only stopping to steady himself and struggling to hold his breath it seemed.*Is that his limit?* I thought and ran as fast as time would allow over to his position and grabbed him.I'll never forget the look on his face as I swung him around and let go.I sent him flying over to Broadside.His fist hadn't moved much in the two intervals of real time we'd experienced.There was plenty of space between him and the soldier he'd literally disarmed.*No real way to stop that momentum.* As I dropped to the ground prone and covered my head, I noticed my nose had started bleeding.*Did he punch me straight on, or did I go too far?Felt like I took a hit to the cheek.*

It was the worst thing I had to worry about once the man in my time got stopped by Broad's fist in his side and gasped for air.
