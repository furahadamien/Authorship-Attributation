I had received seven number one dad mugs already.Curiously enough they all show a seven now.I love it.I could not have it any better.Seven is my lucky number, my birthday is 7/7/77.Seven times I married but luckily the numerology ends there cause I only have three kids.Two lovely boys and the prettiest girl.I started donating sperm when my fourth wife couldn't have a kid.I had been married and divorced thrice and a big part of those previous failures was my reluctance to have kids.I was older and more mature when I met Kate, she was truly the love of my life.In a way, my previous wives were an attempt to reach a woman like her and the subsequent an attempt to fill the void she left me with.A truth that is very hard for me to accept.When we couldn't have kids I felt devastated.I had a strong will (I feel the word urgency is too strong) to be a parent already.She as well.We discussed the matter for weeks, first jokingly and then seriously.Before we attempted we had already put the dream into our heads so the let down was very harsh.Kate died and I married and remarried.I have three angels of my own that fulfill me with the biggest joy and over SEVENty kids that have filled other struggling couples with that same joy.I truly don't care who is number one or why, I'm actually more interested in numbers 70, 77, 777, 7070707, and the so many more seveny combiantions available with over 7 billion humans, although I guess not all of us are dads all of us have one.How, why and who determined the ranking is still unknown.The media immediately started looking for relevant mugs: those gifted to famous people, the actual number one dad, and so on.Me being top ten made me news-worthy.I truly don't mind it very much, I'm just so glad with my sevens.

We are methodical.the Gavrilo Princip society was formed by an unknown person somewhere in the 1930's, or so I was explained.They contacted me via letters, delivered by pigeons.It was very tedious and inefficient but very secure.The day I received the first memory flash drive it seemed like any other delivery.I would found much later about the pigeons.My first  instructions were clear, they contained a dossier of all my life  from the cradle till the day the letter was written.They somehow knew I had worked as a snipper agent for over 25 years.A lot of my army missions were classified, but somehow this Princip person(s) knew them all.The first task was simple: "We know about you, what you must know about us is that we strive to change the world.Once a member, always a member.Dissidence and treason are punishable by death, quick death.Would you like to join us?"I followed their contact instructions and ever since then I ocasionally receive new tasks.Tasks are not optional, the Princip rely on me.On my expertise.I see myself as a valued member of a team with unique skills, and I thinks that's how they see me.My first tasks was the CEO of a company notorious for privatizing water sources.I took down two of the board members and their CEO the same night.Its funny that the media didnt really cover the killings.We like it like that cause that's how we know they are scared, the people who know about the high profile level assassinations don't wanna make a fuzz about it.I am one of a few who are tired of a corrupt system.Some may think we are evil, but the way I see it, we've rid earth of some of the most despicable men, they are almost always old men, but there are other as well.
