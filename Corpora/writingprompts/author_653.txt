A new cure they called it.Nanomachines that could repair and regrow even missing limbs.A miracle.Immortality was in sight.We reached out to it and brushed it with our fingertips.In fact, we pretty much had it in our hands.The patient, Thomas Jin age 124 fully cured from chronic cancer.He had never felt better, in fact he looked like he was 50 again.One medication for all the illnesses.Just one shot a year and youre good."The nanomachine is programmed essentially to be able to change into whatever you want it to be.Using
T-waves we can give it commands, repair this nerve here, agonize that receptor there, block this
transcription pattern etc."Problem was, nanomachines did whatever the T-waves told them to do.Pretty soon T-waves were being used by every military organization there was.We need a self-automated bot

You mean an autonomous robot?

Well it wouldnt be autonomous as in like conscious just enough to give itself orders.

It was a success.However this bot required more frequent dosages, once per month.They couldn't have that, once a month was such a hassle.Nobody had time for that.What about a self-repairing bot?Or one that was a lifetime dose?

You think we could do that?Is it worth it?

Well why wouldnt it be worth it?The shareholders are all on board, Nanotherapy is the hottest thing
around these days.Well call it Infiniject generic infininan.

But how do we make money if we just pretty much cure everyone?

Well someones gonna do it, if it isnt Nanozyme then its gonna be TEVA-pro.WE gotta be the ones to
do it and I bet theyre saying the same thing over there.

Everyone was worried, more than anything, what would happen if Big Pharma painted itself into a
corner.Nanozyme won the race though.Eternibot (generic eternan long acting) was approved for phase 1 trials October 11, 2105.Chester Prin was happy to switch over.Age 85 he was one of the first to try nanobots and they had
cured his Alzheimers.He was young and pretty healthy with previous exposure to nanobots so he was an ideal candidate.He got his physical scan, a poke in the spine, and he was sent on his way along with
the other 8 candidates.Five months later he appeared to have developed some eye pain.They couldnt find anything wrong with his eyes.A neurological side effect?Could be of concern.Will
monitor further.Come back next week.Four days later he was dead.The nanomachines were not stable.They had done their job, but as with anything small they were easy
to break.Easy to change.When they found him he had 5 eyes, an extra kidney, and 2 hearts.Not to mention 2 fingers growing out
of his right ear.They would need to contact the others and bring them in to examine them.Constant surveillance.They
had to figure out what went wrong.They had to make a more stable machine.---

The hospital was under quarantine.Only those with hazard suits were allowed in or out.The machine changed too rapidly.And reproduced, feeding off whatever power source it could find.Be
it heat, molecular, solar.It fed off any material it could find stringing together molecules, particles,
atoms to form ever more incomplete copies of itself.The inside of the hospital was a nightmare.Too much life if you could call it that.Mutilated people everywhere, too many organs all over the place,
its chaos.

no antibiotics dont work, antibiotics kill bacteria.We need anti-nanomachinotics or something

Blood on the walls, blood on the floors, blood on the ceilings.Except not all of it was blood.The blood cleaned off, but the wall was still red.---

Rust, they called it.Too late they discovered the machines were not confined to organic material.This aint no zombie apocalypse thats for sure.A zombie apocalypse at least has a solution- blow the
damned heads off all the zombies.Theres too many heads here to blow off, wouldnt do anything
either.

The reddish stain reached soil and spread like wildfire.The government of the United Americas stated the whole state of Massachusetts was to be
quarantined and probably burned to the ground.People panicked.Freedom of speech got to them.The people got to know whats happening

People ran.---

The mushroom cloud could be seen for miles.Protests, sanctions and all manner of outrage rocked the world.What is America thinking?Have they all gone mad over there?

But at least the machine was contained.Radiation kills people pretty well.It kills a lot of things pretty well.Apparently it doesnt kill nanomachines as well as they had hoped.There was no way to stop it.2 more nukes were dropped before they realized it was too late.The United Americas started upping their space program.Their statement at the World Conference was simply: Were getting the fuck outta here, we suggest
you guys do too.

Outbreaks appeared in Europe.The Communist East Union also soon began seeing it spread through its territories.6 more mushroom clouds hung in the horizon.---

It was time to find a new home.
