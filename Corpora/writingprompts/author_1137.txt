I was smiling as I read the first hundred pages or so.Those were the early days of my life.When I was still young and was playing terrible make believe games with my brothers and sisters.The multitude of choices here never amounted to anything significant.*Decided to agree with sisters; Page 539*

*Decided to agree with brothers; Page 540* 

No real differences that amounted to anything bigger.That was fine.I was actually sort of relieved at that, relieved to know that those choices could never really affect what happened later on."You're stalling," He said.The tone wasn't accusatory nor was it complacent.It just sort of was.Pissed me off a bit actually."Yeah, I am," I scoffed turning to him."These were the better days.Can't I enjoy them?""You can't leave unless the book is done.Those are the rules," He answered.Again, you couldn't get anything out of his voice.It just sort of was."Is there a problem if I don't go?""No.The schedule can be changed.""Than let me read at my own pace, okay?"I called as I turned to the book again."'Sides, I'm not going to read all of it."I wasn't lying.One of my many faults.I wasn't going to waste my time reading every single one of the outcomes that could have occurred if I had chosen a different path.Just the cliff-notes of 'em.I turned back to the index to look up what I believed was the big turning point of my life.When I was finally able to see that the cogs weren't alright.*The fight at the bar; Page 12,443*

I threw the pages until I found what I was looking for.I was actually surprised when I saw that there weren't many choices for this point in my life.*Through a knock-out punch; Page 12,511*

*Through a punch; Page 12,444*

Both scenarios had me fighting which was odd.I thought that maybe there would have been a choice that didn't have me fighting.Guess that wasn't in my path.I turned to the end of the fight, knowing that if this wasn't origin point of what I become, than the end of the fight would have been.Lo' and Behold I was right.*Go back to drinking; Page 12,677*

*Scare his mates; Page 12,788*

*Glass his mates; Page 12,877*

*Finish the fight; Page 12, 554* 

That was it.The point where my life started.I flipped forward a bunch of pages to see what my choice where at another point.I actually laughed out loud when I saw that there were only three options.*Join; Page 23,111*

*Ignore; Page 23,311*

*Rat them out; Page 24,555* 

"Zeus be damned, I was set up from the start," I said as I continued to read down the path I had taken.*Burn the church; Page 25,666*

*Burn the Government Building; Page 25,776*

I continued to read down the path I had chosen, only occasionally glancing at the other possible outcomes of the action I could've taken.My smile never faded as I continued to read down the list of the methods of torture, the people killed, the lives thrown into chaos, the bodies that drowned in the wake of the choices I made.When I was satisfied with what I read, I loudly slammed the book.Just I was began to reach into my pocket, he called over, " Ready to go on?""Give me a sec," I said, as I pulled out my trusty friend.Without a second thought, I flick it up and let the flames lick at the edges of the book.It was only a couple more second before the book I was holding in my hands had caught fire and was burning with a strangely calming orange flame.After I felt satisfied with the results of my actions, I walked over the him, throwing the book over my shoulder."It will not be destroyed.""Figured as much.The place seemed to Holy and shit," I answered with a smile."So, did I get to pick the ride or it just an instantaneous thing.I always figure that singing 'Highway to Hell' while headin' to hell would always be funny as hell.""You don't have any qualms about your actions?"The only time I could tell there was an emotion or a hint of something human."No.I was broken from the start.Besides, I'm pretty sure that if I hadn't chosen the revolution, I would have been a lot less justified in my doings.Maybe some good came out of my actions.Maybe some didn't.I don't really care.I know where I was headed the second, I start on my path.I just hope you guys do your worst."
