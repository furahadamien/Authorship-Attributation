ScreamingNed
Sorry, on mobile!!Formatting is probably a bit off!!Hope this is okay!!He rushed into his quaint home, greedily gasping for air.He slammed the door behind him with a loud crash! He slumped against the door and held his chest in an attempt to collect his thoughts.He was covered in dust and dirt.This had been the third attempt on his life that week, and it was only Tuesday.Hastily, he dusted himself off and hung up his jacket.He took off his hat and tossed it aside.At his feet sat the weekly newspaper and a stack of letters.He bent over and picked up the pile with a slight groan.He glanced at the afternoon paper.It read, Wienen Abendpost; der Dienstag der Oktober 23, 1911. In bold letters, the headline practically screamed, Wien ist heute die viertgrte Stadt der Welt mit zwei Millinonen Einwohnern.
The man smiled to himself at the thought that his beautiful city of Vienna would be the fourth largest city in the world.He tucked the newspaper under his arm to pay attention to his mail.He flipped through it and one particular yellow stained, wax sealed envelope caught his eye.He stared at the front of the envelope in fear, the returning address striking up unresolved anger.It was from the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, and it was addressed to Adolf Hitler.Anxiously, he tore it open and quickly unfolded the letter that held his fate.He quickly skimmed the letter over and sighed in defeat.He tossed the letter onto a pile of similarly written ones.One day hell get accepted into the art school of his dreams.But maybe not today.He walked over to his easel and stared at the empty canvas.He wanted to try again.Every fibre of his being told him to.He walked over to his work area and grabbed a small bottle of canvas primer and a four-inch wide brush.With such grace, he poured some of the primer onto his palette.A glistening white liquid soon rushed out of its glass like prison.Gingerly, he dipped his brush into the primer and began to spread it all over the canvas.Soon, the whole canvas was coated in a beautiful hue of the primer, He laid the canvas on his workbench to set and began to clean up.A knock at the door interrupted his thoughts as he was going to clean up some brushes.He stood up and dusted off what he could from his clothing.Apprehensively, he made his way toward the door.He opened it and before him stood a very tall hooded figure.Adolf jumped back a bit and stared up at the man.Adolf Hitler? the mysterious man spoke calmly.Ja Hitler trailed off, then regained his thoughts, thats me Adolf said, speaking perfect English for no reason at all, like in those foreign movies.I have something important to talk to you about, might I come in? the figure said, sternly.Adolf moved aside to let the man in.The figure made his way into the other mans cluttered home.He took a quick glance at the sketches and paintings that filled the room.The sun shone cheekily through the half drawn curtains, illuminating the figures facial features.The strange man pulled off his hood, but kept his hat on.Adolf stared up at him as the man began to speak.So, you like to paint, Adolf? the man gestured toward the dozens of paintings that lavished the room.Ja, I do, Hitler said dismissively.Have you applied to any art schools lately?These are fantastic, the man asked as he rifled through a pile of sketches on his desk.He looked up at Adolf expectantly.Ive been trying to get into the Academy of Fine Arts here in Vienna for a while, but I havent been accepted Adolf sighed and pressed on, they said that I lack technique? he shrugged it off and stared down at his feet.The man nodded thoughtfully and pulled up a nearby stool to sit beside Adolf.Well, the stranger paused to think, how about I teach you how to paint?I can show you proper techniques and how to mix paint correctly?I can help you Adolf! the man offered and looked over at him.The future Fhrer leaned back in his seat and pondered the offer.A sly smirk slid across his face and he looked over at the man.Whats in it for you then? Adolf added, you know, to teach me all those things?
        The man forced himself not to laugh and he let out a soft sigh in its replacement, I just think its best for you to get into art school and I would love to be able to help.

    The stranger stood up and began to rustle through the paints and brushes that had sat untouched over the past few days.He picked up the freshly primed canvas and rested it on the easel in front of him.He walked over to the wide array of paints and picked up a few different hues of blue and grabbed a nearby palette and sat them on the table next to the easel.He motioned Adolf to sit next to where he stood.I want you to try and paint a sky for me, Adolf.A nice Austrian afternoon sky, the man instructed.Adolf nodded and picked up a two-inch flat brush.He set it down to pour his paint onto the palette.Hesitantly, he dipped his brush into the lightest shade of blue available, a soft prussian blue.Adolf grabbed a scalpel and squeezed titanium white from its tube and began to mix it into the prussian blue.Eagerly, Adolf sat and waited for further instruction from the mysterious man.Adolf was finally relieved when he spoke.Now, paint the whole canvas Adolf, dont be shy, the man spoke as calm as he could to relax the nervous painter.In one swift motion, he removed his brush from the perfect pool of pretty paint and onto the canvas.The man stood behind the anxious painter, analyzing every stroke.Soon, the whole canvas was covered in a sea of beautiful blue.This looks great so far, Adolf.Now mix a small bit of Club Navy into your paint puddle and gently brush from the sides into the centre.This creates strokes that will blend into the initial layer, the man said with a soft smile, watching Adolf physicate his words.Hitler held onto every last word the man spoke.Adolf obeyed, slowly mixing the paint.He began to roughly stroke the brush against the canvas, only to have the strangers hand stop him.Relax, the man said calmly and added, Im not judging you for your painting, take your time, Adolf.

    Gently, the man guided Adolfs hand along the canvas and applied the perfect amount of pressure to show Hitler what he had to do.Youre doing just fine, Adolf.Please try not to rush yourself.Youre doing great, the man ensured.Adolf nodded and followed the strangers advice and perfectly blended the darker hue into the light blue, Adolf looked up at the man for further orders.Try doing tiny little Xs in the corners with the darker navy blue, like this, the man said as he demonstrated by painting a small corner of the canvas before continuing, its just like cross-hatching in a sketch.Now, you try, Adolf, the man suggested and handed Adolf the brush.Adolf sighed and followed through.Much to his surprise, he was able to replicate it almost perfectly.See!I knew you could do it!Now mix a tiny bit of black into the paint and repeat the process, the stranger ordered.Adolf nodded and dipped his two-inch brush into the paint, his hand trembling as he got closer to the canvas.He gently placed the brush onto the canvas, but his nerves got the best of him when his hand slipped and he left a large dark blue streak across the canvas.Adolf dropped the brush onto the palette in frustration.He stared up at the stranger with a small hint of fear in his eyes that was quickly blinked away.The stranger smiled down at Adolf and gently took his hand.Easy there, tiger.Stay calm.There are no mistakes, just happy accidents, he assured him and continued, what we need to do is go to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts and talk to them about accepting you.I know you have the potential to be a great painter, the stranger stated with great confidence.
