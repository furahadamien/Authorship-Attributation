I put my phone down and think to myself.My body is shaking, the amount of anxiety in my body is telling me to shut the blinds so I dont tempt myself to look at the moon.I dont want to get though, I have this strange feeling that if I go shut the blinds that I couldnt resist but to look at the moon.I lay on my right side so the window would be behind me and I wouldnt even see.My phone starts to ring, its a call from my mom but not really my mom.My phone shined bright with the name Alexander Cannion, its was my old name for my moms contact in my android phone.But ever since I switched to iPhones, my moms contact name was just mom.I decide to pick it up, Hello, who is this? I wanna be optimistic about this and I want this whole thing to be a prank.Blake, look at the window and look how beautiful the moon. It was a deep feminine voice, she sounded very bland and emotionless.Who is this? I demanded to know, I know I sounded like a dick but I felt my heartbeat get more intense as the call went on, I was on edge of having a panic attack.The moon is beaut... I hung up, thinking to myself screw this lady.I needed to calm down, I cant call much of anybody, nobody is awake right now.I start to lay on my back, I just need something to calm my body down.Something to smooth me and make me feel at peace within again.I sit up and I look at my stupid phone just more of those look at the moon messages.So stupid, I cant even stop them though, they are coming in from all my social medias.I finally have had the last straw, I shut off my phone because now these messages are starting to freak me out even more.I just wish there was something to calm me down and help me relax.I start to gaze at the gas station lights across the street and I see the shadow of the building.Wow, the moon must really be bright tonight, I thought.Maybe one peak wouldnt be that bad after all the moon should help calm me down...
