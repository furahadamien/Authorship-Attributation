My_Feet_Are_Real
It used to be that my duty was done with compete disaffection.Not once in prior eons have I interfered with or cared about the lives I have ended.That was before I saw their own mortal perspective reflected back at me, visible for the first time.They were running out, and if they ceased to exist, so would I. I do not want to end.I have only one lens with which to see the world and only one tool to work with, but it will do.I take nine of the eleven men gathered outside of the village.They will become an asset instead of a threat.I take the man who carries his knife silently through the village at night.His body will be found in the morning.I take the child who fought the rat while scavenging in the city.Her body is far away and will remain undiscovered.I take the child from it's mother before it grows too big to exit the womb.They are good with patterns.It is hard to understand sometimes, but they are beginning to see what I am doing.With more time, they will celebrate me.
