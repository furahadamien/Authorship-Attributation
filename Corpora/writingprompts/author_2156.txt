"Put down everything and put up your hands!Make one move, and you die!"Hothead Fawkes waves his pistol at the people in the bank, who all immediately drop what they're doing and put up their hands as told.Chubby Shark, Hothead's partner, takes out a small handheld device."Sorry if you have an expensive phone, haha!"Shark says as he pushes a button on the device, and immediately all the lights in the bank go out."Electromagnetic pulse.Goodbye silent alarms, heh heh!"Shark goes to the counters and commands one of the staff at gunpoint to fill his bags with cash.He laughs louder and louder as hundreds of thousands are poured out for him and Hothead to share.Suddenly, just as the last bag becomes full, a voice calls from the bank entrance."You!You two naughty kids!I have come to stop you - for the millionth time!"The eyes of the scared, shivering citizens in the bank light up with hope as they turn to see Captain Thunderbolt, the superhero of the city 50 years ago."How many times do I, do I have to teach you two a lesson, before you finally learn, that crime is not the way to go!"Captain Thunderbolt rumbles as he points his cane at Hothead Fawkes and Chubby Shark."Okay, okay Thunderbolt, you got me again,"  
Hothead puts his gun on the floor, and Captain Thunderbolt slowly walks towards him and breaks the gun with a powerful thrust of his cane.Seeing this, Chubby Shark makes a confused face."Hothead, you're just gonna give up like that?"Hothead Fawkes turns towards Shark, nodding."Face it Shark.We grew up robbing banks and fighting Thunderbolt, and we've never won.What do you think makes this time different?"Shark lets out a long sigh, then drops his gun.He proceeds to hand the cash-filled bags to the bank staff."Okay.You got us, Thunderbolt.Arrest us, do whatever you do.""You know what, you two?I'll let you off this one time, because you surrendered.But, if I ever see you robbing banks again"  
"Then you'll zap us with lightning?""yes, I'll zap you with lightning!Now get outta here, you little punks!Promise to yourself, that you'll never commit a crime again!"Captain Thunderbolt maintains his authoritative tone that he's been using for 50 years, even before his first encounter with Hothead and Shark.As the two embarrassed criminals walk out of the bank, they are blinded by a flash.As the bright light fades away, they see a person blocking the way.It's a teenager wearing a bright blue jacket and long gym pants, hovering a few feet from the ground.She is Dawn, the girl born with mystical powers, and she has recently started to fight crime."Halt, bank robbers!Hand over the cash!"Dawn yells with an inherited authoritative tone."We already did.We're going home now, if you'd excuse us," says Hothead Fawkes, gesturing to the inside of the bank.Confused, Dawn glances into the bank's glass doors and sees Captain Thunderbolt, slowly walking out."Grandpa?What are you doing here?Weren't you just at home watching TV?""I told you, Dawn.I'm Captain Thunderbolt!I've been fighting crime in this city before your father even met your mother!""Yeah, whatever, Gramps.Always rambling about your *'good old days'*.I'm gonna arrest these guys."Chubby Shark taps Dawn on the shoulder."You should listen to your grandpa, you know.He let us go.""Yes, I let them go!I even got them to return the cash they just robbed the bank for!"Captain Thunderbolt shouts at Dawn with anger."They're criminals, grandpa!They belong in prison!""No, they deserve to learn a lesson and become good people again!I've given them their lesson, you don't get to interfere, little girl!""I'm done listening to these two argue.Let's go, Shark," Hothead says while shaking his head."Hey, don't think about escaping!"Dawn ignores her grandfather and throws a punch at Hothead Fawkes.He cries in pain."Hey!She attacked you first, you have every right to fight back!"Captain Thunderbolt yells as he throws Chubby Shark's gun to its owner.Dawn is quick and strong and can fly, but she isn't bulletproof.Chubby Shark shoots at Dawn, and she manages to dodge every one of the shots, except for the last one, which scrapes her left thigh, and she tumbles to the ground.The partners immediately flee the scene.Captain Thunderbolt walks over to Dawn with the help of his cane.She is panting heavily, and he can tell that she is scared out of her mind.This is the first time Dawn has been shot, albeit very mildly."Silly grandchild.That'll teach you a lesson."
