It's a normal day, in a normal town, in a normal country on a Tuesday.I struggle to finish my short story due on Thursday, and I'm drawing a blank.I decide to get up and get some fresh air.I walk to the store, say hi to some friends, and I'm debating whether or not to get a hot pizza from the Italiano's across the street.I decided why not, and walk in.as I look at the menu, my vision starts to blur around the edges, and soon I can't see anything, as I tumble to the ground.That's how it started, and it's also how it ended, 2 years later, with a few minor differences.the menu is a file on my Auditory Vision Replacement(AVR for short), and instead of vision blurring out, I start seeing light from the inside out.I wake up in the hospital.I can't bare to open my eyes, as the light flowing in from the window is too much for my unaccustomed eyes.Slowly, I manage to get my eyes open a little bit.Oh, gosh, I'm getting ahead of myself, aren't I?My name is Thomas, and like everyone else, I was blinded in the Great Blinding.For 2 years, we've all been being told that God has taken away our sight for being ungrateful of it.All bullshit, in my opinion.I think that they just wanted to make us blind for some reason.Don't quite know what.Back to the hospital.As I lie in my bed, I slowly accustom myself to my surroundings.Looks much the same as I remember.A bit dirty, but nothing much.And then I see them.The words "Don't tell them you can see" were scrawled all over the wall.in bright red.The realization hits me...Someone \*died\* so that someone could see.Must be pretty fucking important.more in part 2...
