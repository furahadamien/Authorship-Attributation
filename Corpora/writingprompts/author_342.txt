I grew up in the 'burbs.If you grow up white, you don't really notice how much people keep to themselves.It's just no big deal to not talk much to your neighbors, and no issue at all if your neighbors leave you alone.White people just don't notice when our not-white neighbors don't interact with us.I mean, it's different in the city, where you can't avoid interacting with people from vastly different backgrounds.There's only so much space, and there are so many people.And it's different in a small town where your options are to know everyone or be 'that weirdo who should fuck off out of town.'But in the suburbs?There's too many people to act like a racist jerk, but not enough to actually force interaction with people unlike yourself.So yeah, I grew up with hispanic neighbors, but I never talked to them.We even had a family from somewhere in Africa move into the apartment underneath ours, but again, we never spoke.All the kids who spoke Spanish as their primary language had a clique of their own in school, and the few kids who even noticed were either arrogantly anti-immigrant, either glad to not have to interact, or being assholes about how there should be laws against not speaking English in public, or they were naive enough to think that those kids hung out because they just wanted to, and not because they just wanted to be able to speak in the language they were most comfortable with.It never even crossed my mind, then.Obviously, I have thought about it a lot since then.It took me awhile to figure out how I made it so far without figuring it out... but I'm getting ahead of myself.My first clue came in 9th grade, Spanish class.Our regular teacher was a delightful old woman who probably should have been a nun (the type who feed the homeless, not the type who beat kids with rulers), but had gone to uni in Spain to become a teacher instead.I did pretty well in class.Better than most of my classmates, but not by that much.I had the same result with math and English, so it wasn't really anything surprising.Then we had a substitute teacher who was born and raised in Venezuela.I didn't talk much in class, usually, but I must've asked a question or something, because he pulled me aside after class to berate me for taking a class on a language I am obviously fluent in, and for lying to my regular teacher about it.I was confused.I had a good grade, and I understood the material because I studied, but I was far from fluent.My regular teacher talked yo me about it the next day, but we both brushed it off.I was obviously not fluent, and neither of us could figure out how the sub came to that conclusion.I should have thought about it more, but I was a dumb kid.I forgot about it almost completely, until I got my first job.A lot of kids I knew worked after school jobs, but my parents worried that it would negatively impact my grades, so they wouldn't let me get a job until the month before I graduated.I wasn't planning on going to college right away, and I couldn't really fuck up my grades at that point.It was a regular fast food gig that kids that age tend to get.Turnover was pretty high, mostly because it's a shit-level job with shit pay.I worked there for a few months with no problems.Then came Ana.She trained on a different shift, so I didn't meet her til she'd been working for a few weeks.We were introduced with a 'hey, this is the new girl, help her not screw up.'We were the only two people on a slow shift, so of course, we started talking.I'd heard she was pretty quiet, and didn't talk much, but to my surprise, she was pretty chatty.We mostly talked about the usual.School, work, tv shows.It was a pretty good shift, until the end of it.Some jackass came in, ordered food, and yelled on his way out the door."Hey, this is America.Speak English or go back ti Mexico!"I just stood there kindof stunned.I had no idea why anyone would say something like that to *anyone*, but especially to us.Yeah, we were talking, but we were speaking English, right?"I hate assholes like that.Like I don't belong here just because I wasn't born here.Like speaking any language other than English is a crime.... Where did you learn Portuguese, anyway?"________

I have plans for this one, but I'm leaving it here, because typing it on my phone sucks.
