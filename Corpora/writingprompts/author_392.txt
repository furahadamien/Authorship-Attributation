LePetitFille
I check their I.D.'s for fun now, noticing nose jobs and cheek implants and the occasional sex change.It doesn't matter though... there are always some who try to get past me.A strikingly beautiful blonde with a shining "19" above her head brazenly looking me straight in the eye, not a flicker of hesitation as she hands me a well made fake stating she was twenty three years old.The three men around her, all with numbers higher than my own glare menacingly as I shine my light on the counterfeit piece of identification.I decide it's not worth the altercation and let her through but I yearn to just whisper  "Why are you trying to grow up so damn fast?There's nothing in here for you."I never learned why I could see these numbers, to be honest I thought everyone could, and by the time I was old enough to question it, I knew enough not to bring any more attention to myself.Now it makes my job easy, and it's a neat trick at parties.I don't question when women lie to make themselves younger, and yes, occasionally I let someone who is trying make themselves older slide past, into the bar for their drinks and their laughs.Frankly...I just couldn't care anymore.Ive seen it all, women who look thirty five but have a bright "50" floating a few inches above their head.Young men with full beards that would easily pass as mid twenties who are mere teenagers.It's remarkable, really, the variations in how humans age.Were I a man of more scientific inclinations I might feel compelled to get to the bottom of my "gift".In truth, I'm typically more concerned with when I can punch out and get drunk enough that the numbers start to blur and I can pretend I'm not seeing the mortality of others... but angels with luminous halos.Every week I stand outside the door to a trendy L.A. bar and grit my teeth through the drip, drip of painful repetition.Mine was the sort of redundant occupation that people might complain gave them carpal tunnel.I used to look forward to the occasional bar room brawl to break up the monotony that has become my life, but as iPhones get larger and pants get tighter and more and more men declare themselves as "feminist" it's a rare occurrence that I can't set my hopes on.So instead I look at these little plastic rectangles and relish in the tiny details they hope won't be noticed.Live in L.A. as long as I have, and you'll see every nip and tuck.Most nights, I arrive at the bar by seven thirty, have a beer or two with Lonnie, the bartender, before taking up my post on my wooden stool just to the left of a black painted door.I've worked at many bars but this bar had the unique distinction of being the only place I'd encountered that put forth an effort to appear seedy in order to sling overpriced whiskey sours to L.A. hipsters who wanted to feel as if they'd spent a night slumming it without any of the real life danger they might encounter were they to venture into an actual slum.You know the type, they wear ripped jeans that cost as much as my rent and carry folded paperback copies of "The Old Man and The Sea" in their back pocket.In other words...real winners.Tonight was no different and after my second beer, some craft bullshit from down in San Diego that Lonnie said, "We're the only bar in L.A.  That has this.Some guy literally brews this in his bedroom.It's totally exclusive", I took my seat and waited for the string of mullet wearing degenerates to pile in.At first I rubbed my eyes, thinking maybe I'd blurred two people's numbers together.Maybe there was someone walking just behind him, out of view.Nope, as he got closer I stood up.The man was a little taller than me.Not any kind of unusual looking character, but not the typical patron of this joint either.He wore a simple suit and close cropped haircut, but what I was seeing couldn't be possible.The man looked to be at most, in his early thirties.The bright, shiny number hovering just above his dark hair however, showed "2021".I realized my mouth was open and that I was staring.When he got closer he mumbled "hey" and reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet, then, just like everyone else, an I.D.Just a normal California license with his photograph, his height, weight, address and name- "Christensen, Jess H."  The birthdate gave him an age of thirty three but my gift had never been wrong.Ever.Not in my entire life had a number above someone's head been even a year off their actual age.This simply, wasn't possible.I turned the plastic over and stalled for time, "So, from L.A.originally?"He replied, "Israel, actually, but it feels like I've been in L.A. since forever."I hand him back the card and he just smiled and walked inside.All night I couldn't get the man out of my head.Was he some kind of vampire?Or maybe some monster of an Israeli Dr. Frankenstein?It just couldn't be.I came to the conclusion that something had gone haywire and my gift was starting to falter."Shit" I thought to myself, "Now I'm gonna have to really start paying attention to birthdates."But the rest of the night my numbers always matched the birthdates on the I.D.'s.It seemed this man was the only one the glitch affected.The night started to wind down and people trickled out as bar close neared.Finally, I noticed the four digit man slip outside.He stopped to light a cigarette and I don't know if it was the late hour or if it just bugged me too much but I reached over and tapped him on the shoulder, "Excuse me, man"  He turned and smiled, this guy didn't seem like a monster.In fact seeing his face made me feel like I'd bitten off half a Xanax, but I persisted, "I gotta ask, you know, I have this real good knack for reading people and I gotta say... something's telling me you're older than you say you are."What he said back to me... well, it just about knocked me over.
