TheMediocreMaster
It had been my greatest achievement.6 billion lives snuffed out in a symphony of chaos.As the fire consumed most of the world I felt a power wash over my form as no being had ever experienced.Back then death brought me joy, but no longer, no there was only...something.Slowly as the years dragged in there were fewer and fewer humans, and for the first time since they had taken that first bite of knowledge, I lost power.At first I reveled in their demise, I made games of how to end them.I made one group eat each other as the cold of winter creeped into their bunker, others died in massive pits consecrated to MY glory, but something changed.Where before I had no trouble finding a new plaything, I now have to search, theres barely any now and I feel....well, me at my doorstep.BOOM!!Damn it...I dont remember causing that....its like Im fading without them...like I need them to continue...I need to end this, its gone too far.I cast my senses over the world, desperately searching for a sign, any, of human life, but all I find is death and destruction.And then theres something, its weak but it...shes there.Shes lying on the ground in a pool of blood, not hers.I look around a see a woman lying next to her, cradling her, she looks so peaceful.Im brought back to the present by the sound of the baby crying, her life is so weak but theres something familiar there, a strength I hadnt felt in millennia.I lean done, my emaciated hands outstretched to pick her up, and I realize why her life feels so familiar, we had met before, at the beginnings of my existence.Hello Eve, I crone, my voice calming the baby girl, her brown eyes meeting the black orbs in my skull as she smiles up at me, lets find your Adam, shall we?

As I walk out of the ruins where Eve was born, my mind is alight with possibilities, maybe soon I can return to my old hobbies...death will never find me so long as she lives.
