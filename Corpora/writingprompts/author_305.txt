Can't just change the outside to change the inside, they said.They're wrong.Over the years I've found every person has tons, and tons of different sides.When I change on the outside, I bring out a different part of me.She's never needed that.The first time I saw her, I barely paid her any attention.Then she went on that stage and gave the most interesting lecture on neuroplasticity I had ever seen.The way she moved, the way her voice sang, the way her eyes spoke with fire.I've tried everything to be the perfect man for her.I've tried to show her my strength, my humor, my innocence, my charm.My kindness.I have nothing left but the side of me that scares me.The side that is raw power.The side nobody has ever seen.My last resort.----

He walked out of the bathroom with a calm decisiviness.Finally, someone different, she thought.Maybe she'd finally find someone who could just be himself.His words as he sat startled her."We've met before, Alex.Come with me if you want to see that theres magic in this world.""What?Is this a joke?Alright, for a first date this is definitely new.I'll play along."He stood up, gently took her hand and bade her follow.They made their way to a park, poorly lit, and she started to wonder if she had made a mistake.Finally, another woman appeared on a bench.At least someone else was around.Unexpectedly, he stopped, and kneeled before this woman."My name is Kaelan.We have met dozens of times.Today I show you the truth."She tried to say something about a date, and her eyes started to light up with fear.His head then turned towards Alex.It was at that moment that Alex started feeling the warmth start spreading at her finger tips.When she felt herself start bubbling, she freaked."What the fuck is going on?!?"He grabbed her hand, and they started melting together."Alex, before your first memory, you and I were one and the same.I've been going through and assimilating all of the parts of me I've left behind.It's time we both disappear so that El can return.This is why you've felt so empty all of this time.You are a shadow of your truth.You can... you can leave if you want.I understand that you have a life.But.. you won't die from this.Neither will I, we'll both just be...more."She should've run but, she didn't.And then there she was, seeing through different eyes, looking down at this woman whom now took on for her (him?)A different meaning.Her eyes, her eyes were full of terror.She bolted.With new eyes, they watched her go."Of course she did... what was I thinking," thought El.But they felt... they felt... good.Whole.In that moment, El realized that they had missed being able to be themselves.Maybe it's time humanity meets me again.He heard yelling in the distance."What are those lights?!?""My god, do you see the colors?!?I've never seen colors like that!!""It's...
