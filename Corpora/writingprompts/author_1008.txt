When I was just a little lad
I won a raffle, told my dad
Oreos were what Id won
Now Ill never want for fun


All day long Id sit and eat
Till one day I saw an empty street
The barren road joined barren towns
Most of London had burned down


No one here or in between 
No Big Ben or royal queen 
Lost me dad, lost me mum
But not my cookie sandwich fun 


They found me daily, like magic
In any place, was quite the trick
I have no reason for this fodder 
Im just Lonely Harry Potter.
