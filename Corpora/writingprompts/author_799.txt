I clutch at the bridge of my nose in an attempt to calm my headache as Anger continues to pace back and forth fuming at me.I swear that if this leaves any wrinkles on my gorgeous face... 

No amount of explanation that June is "Pride month" in the way of sexuality and gender identity freedom seemed to calm the group down.Even Sloth, who was usually a shapeless mass of gunk, was putting in the effort to create a human-like shape sleeping on the couch with half of her hair straightened and the rest frizzed just to show me that she was bitter about it by spouting "I don't even care!"here and there between Envy and Angers fuming.&#x200B;

Then, I got an idea.&#x200B;

"Guys shut up!I will not strain my voice so quiet down..." I waited until I heard was the sound of Gluttony gulping down soda from a two liter bottle and the sound of small "ding"s from Lust's phone as Tinder notification after notification popped up.Running my fingers through my hair to ensure it fell just the right way as they trained their eyes on me, I smiled "What do you mean you all don't have any months devoted to you?""Gluttony!"I turn to him suddenly and shock him out of his passionate consumption of an entire box of graham crackers, freezing to meet my eyes "We all know that your month is November.I mean come on, it's the time of Thanksgiving and the weather starts to get colder so everyone just assumes it's okay to let themselves go by shoveling things into their mouth.." Gluttony appraises me with a thumbs up and a cascade of cracker crumbs coming out of his mouth as he mutters "Thanks Pride!""Sloth" i turn towards the humanoid blob of a being that just shoots me a "Eh" in response."We all should realize that July is your month!You know, the summer is really starting to kick it and all of the classes are over and done with so people suddenly stop caring if they wake up before two in the afternoon?They don't really socialize for half the summer or do any work in July."I watch cautiously and feel a sense of acceptance from Sloth as her form melts into her normal blobby form.&#x200B;

"Greed- Hey that's my purse!"I gasp out as I catch the skinny, jeweled, middle aged woman slipping a piece of currency out of my Louis Vuitton handbag."Just don't take my bubblegum pink lipstick, only I can pull off that color."I state with a swish of my hand through my hair."Anyways, greed, your month is obviously December considering that all anyone can think about is what gifts they are going to receive at the end of it.How much money can they save while buying gifts?How many friends can they accumulate to go to parties with?Will they get that one or five expensive things they just... HAVE to have?"Greed seems to be pleased that she gets her own entire month and it has Christmas AND New Years Eve in it.&#x200B;

"Lust!"I look around in a dainty looking spin only to find that Lust is nowhere to be found until I can hear the sound of kissing from her bedroom.Ugh, this is MY TIME, the attention is supposed to be on me!I walk over steaming and knock loudly only to hear her say  


"I am a bit busy Pride!I have a lady friend over do you mind if we talk later?""Actually I am a dude"  
"Oh honey I am so sorry.Pride I have a man friend over do you mind if we talk later?"I roll my eyes and call back out to my pansexual friend "I was just saying that February is definitely your own month considering the fact that Valentine's Day is smack in the middle and all anyone can think about the entire time is getting with someone and/or getting some."I have to guess if Lust agreed or not since all I get in response is the sound of squeezing bedsprings.&#x200B;

I turn towards Envy who is glaring at the ruby ring on Greed's finger.The two of them are twins that never seem to get along, always fighting over possessions that none of them really need.Which is fine since all of them look pretty but still it is a struggle to get his attention."Envy, your month is obviously August."Envy looks totally lost, but soon mutters that he wish he had clear skin like mine.Doesn't everyone?I smile brightly "Think about it, it's when school is back in session and everyone is trying to look better than everyone else.It's when you get jealous that one girl has breasts larger than yours or that that one coworker got that vacation trip that you had been planning in your head for forever.It's when the end of summer is so close and you suddenly realize that you didn't do so many things that other people got to do, get to do soon or have and all you want is to take it from them."Envy is not communicative, instead turning to his sister and arguing that the red jewel would look much better on him.Anger is almost immediately in my face "Why the fuck am I last?Am I the least important to you-" I cut him off with a finger on his lips "Shhh look into my pretty eyes, believe me you are not the least important, your month actually starts the year.January, think about it.Everyone is getting out of the holidays and realizing just how much weight they gained and they now have some sort of year goal bred from anger at themselves that they have to accomplish.On top of that, the winter is really starting to drag on and everyone is angry at the weather, wanting it to get warmer."And that seems to sate him enough to send him grumbling angrily elsewhere.All of my friends go about their normal lives, their issues sated and the arguing stopped.What can I say, I am obviously amazing.The best of the group by far.
