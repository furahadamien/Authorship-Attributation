"You know, you should probably cut the onions underwater so your eyes don't get irritated.""Shut up.""No really, it helps.Trust me.I chopped onions all day long.People called me the onion shredder.Rubbish nickname, don't use it.""Shut up."The man put his knife down and walked to his living room where he fell into his armchair, sighing and placing a hand over his eyes."Alright.No need to get so worked up.""Alright that's it, onion shredder, whatever.If you want to live here, how bout you start paying some rent.At least that's somewhat useful.""I am useful!And I told you not to call me onion shredder."The voice sounded almost indignant."Whatever.I'm going to bed, and I'll just eat a larger breakfast tomorrow."The man stood up and strode to his bedroom, the voice oddly silent.&nbsp;

Impossible.There it was, an envelope brimming with cash.He took it and counted it.Five thousand dollars."What the hell?""Is that enough?"The voice asked."I'm not sure about it.Had to sell my saliva collection to pay for it, but eh, I like it here.And a bit of saliva never hurt anyone."The man pushed the memory of his neighbour being rushed to the hospital due to a freak saliva accident, and looked around the empty room."So, you're real?Invisible, I suspect?""Sort of.I'm a bleed-off from a dimension different from yours.Bit of a weird place, don't go there without a few ball bearings and a bucket of water.""And you've been pretending to be the voice in my head the whole time?I thought I was schizophrenic!I spent money on mental health checkups!"The man yelled at the empty room."Oof.Sorry to break it to you, but you are still schizophrenic.I probably worsened the thing, but hey, the rent covers it, right?""I swear I am going to beat the shit out of you if I ever get my hands on you."The man spun around a few times."Hey, hey, you told me I could stay if I paid rent.""I was joking!""Wow.Can you hear anyone laughing?""Wait, so alternate dimensions are real?""Yes, our side knew about it for ages.My kindergarten thesis was on the correlation between the bridges to this dimension and the amount of French cheese in the surrounding area.Failed, but I like to think the teacher just loved French cheese too much.""Oh dear lord.Do I have to put up with you all year long?""No, don't worry about that, I got an hour away from here every month, so not all year long."The man imagined the onion shredder having a cheeky smile on its face.He sighed."Alright, don't be too annoying, and when I say shut up, shut up.""I am not annoying.I like to think I've been a positive influence in your life.""Really?"The man said, sarcasm dripping from his words."Yes!Remember your stunt in the storeroom last month?I pulled the offending stool out of the way, and you didn't hurt your foot!""I fell off and hurt my back, you bloody idiot!""And I knew you got tired of kids kicking footballs at your window, so I installed a 50,000 volt perimeter defense system within five meters of your house!""What?That's gotta break every safety regulation in the damn country!""No, only 85% of them, trust me I checked.And, I knew you got tired of your neighbour's car honking every morning, so I sent him and his ugly car into the shadow realm!""You did?Alright, we need to break out the bottles of beer and celebrate!"he started walking to the kitchen

"Yeah, about that.""What is it?""I noticed your alcohol problem and decided to donate your stash to the Alcoholics Anonymous.They like beer right?They got alcohol in the name."The man thought back to the explosions last week.He facepalmed.
