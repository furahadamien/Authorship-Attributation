Did you hear? Leslie asked as she banged the front door shut behind her.I could only imagine one thing she might be talking about.It had been everywhere at school that dayin hurried between-class conversations, in the five-minute daily news summary my politics teacher played at the start of each class, even on the desk of my statistics teacher, who ranked #1,000,371.(Wed asked him why he wasnt embarrassed to have everyone see it, and hed enthusiastically explained what a great object lesson in population size it was.After hed finished explaining, wed had to admit he was doing pretty well for himself.)Yeah, of course I heard, I said.Leslie glanced toward the mug cabinet and I shrugged in invitation.I already checked, but you can see for yourself.

She was already halfway across the kitchen as she demanded, Come on, how did he?

I smirked.How do you think?

Leslie didnt have to look far, since Id already done all the rummaging.Huh, she said after a second.Yeah, I agreed.You think hell watch the news?

My sister laughed.Does he ever? Then she said more soberly, Trish, we cant *ever* tell him.

Well, obviously, I said.If he found out, hed never let us forget about it.Shouldnt be a problem, though.Unless he sees somebody elses mug, hell never know the difference.
