G'day friends, my name's Steve Irwin, and you're watchin' Crocodile Hunter!Today we're going on an adventure to the Australian Outback, my homeland.Nothing better than wrangling a kangaroo, right mate?But we're not after any kangaroos today, no.We're going to find ourselves... a *drop bear*.These lovely buggers are a tad bit like the koala, but with the attitude of a pissed off crocodile.You gotta be careful when you handle 'em, that is if you can even get close enough.Now, what makes a drop bear different from his cousin the koala is his predatory nature.A koala spends his afternoons munching on eucalyptus leaves, but a drop bear, a drop bear has a hankering for human flesh, especially the face.There're too many stories floating about out there in the great beyond about a clueless tourist losing his face to a drop bear.Tsk tsk.They might look cuddly mate, but they'll chew your face off faster than you can shout "blimey!"We're gonna have t'be careful when we see one.Usually, you can spot yourself a drop bear lolly-gagging in the tree branches, but it's best you make sure he can't see you.Look.Over there, to the left.See him?That's a drop bear.Looks like we've got a baby one.That's not a good sign-- mama shouldn't be too far off.Let's try 'n get a closer look.Now, it's important to keep your distance and use proper technique when approaching a drop bear.Luckily, your buddy Steve here's a certified drop bear handler.Not an honor to be taken lightly.So, first thing you're gonna wanna do when wrangling yourself a drop bear is cover up your face.The face is the drop bear's favorite point of attack, so you need to be prepared.In the wild, a startled drop bear will indiscriminately shred face.We've got ourselves a handy ski mask here, not too easy to find down under, eh?Any face covering will do, but you're gonna want to avoid disguising yourself as anything a drop bear might decide he fancies for lunch.Now that my face is properly hidden, I can think about getting closer to the drop bear.I'm standing underneath him right about now, but I don't think he sees me yet.When dealing with drop bears, you need to make yourself known.Let's yell at him."Eh drop bear!"Crikey!We got his attention now.Look at the way he's descending from his perch.Any second now, he'll drop right to the ground.That's how the drop bear gets 'is name.Isn't nature amazing?Alright, so now we've got our buddy the drop bear right where we want him.Let's jump on it!Crikey, he's a fighter.When you tackle a drop bear, you want to position your face away from his teeth and grab him under the chin, like this.I don't know about you mate, but I favor keeping my face.Now that we've got him pinned, you can see the little guy relaxing.Don't be fooled mate, the drop bear is a sneaky little bugger.He'll jump right up at a moment's notice, so you got to keep your eye on him.Let's get a better look at his teeth.See how sharp those are?In the wild, the drop bear uses those wily fangs of his to incapacitate any unfortunate creature that happens under his branch.Our buddy sure is cute, but he's dangerous, and it's not right to interfere with a wild animal's day to day activities.At least not too much.Let's say goodbye to our friend the drop bear.Take it easy, little bugger!Next, join me as I journey off to the American Southwest in search of a legendary beast, the chupacabra.A wolf-like menace so dangerous, and so elusive, everyone who's tried to capture one has found themselves a drained, bloodless husk.Join us next time, only on Discovery.Edit: spelling
