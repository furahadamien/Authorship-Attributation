> 	Agent Jormundson walked down hallway leading into the briefing room awaiting what he thought would be a very boring briefing on the Japanese military.Agent Thor "Hammer" Jormundson was an old hand at these meetings.Last week it was the Korean Army vs. the North Koreans, and today it was the South Korean allies, the JSDF.Hed heard it all before, even though it was classified, it never meant it was interesting.The CIA had a thing about having a plan for a plan for a plan, and of course never using any of them.This was something that he sort of liked.Jormundson loved his on-the-spot planning, he felt the agency really came alive when he had to think on his feet.> 
> 	Not that he was going to do that for the next hour, instead he mentally prepared himself to read more graphs than anyone could remember, and pretend to write notes on goings on in the far east that he couldnt possibly be less interested in.The Japanese were a stubborn and conservative people, very meticulous; but for someone whos expertise was in Europe alone: absolutely boring.He walked into the room with a look of absolute boredom that he knew that the adviser was bound to expect.However the room was empty.> 
> 	Jormundsen turned around and looked at the room number, and found he was in the right room, but it was empty, save for the conference table, a large TV, and office chairs that probably cost more than he made in three months.As his eyes came down from the room sign, he saw an older man walking down the hallway flanked with two other men in very unusual uniform, hed seen many, but these struck him, hed never quite seen anything like it.> 
> 	Jormundsen whod just sat down brushed himself off as he sat up and reached out for a handshake.pleasure, Im Jormundsen, you must be Jeremy Winton? 
> 
> 	Jormundsen was thoroughly thrown off at this point, the two men wore what seemed to be a military uniform, but had what looked like balaclavas up to their eyes, and small slits like gills alongside their necks, in these slits was some more cloth covered in red, white and blue stripes.On their shoulders were the usual camo United States Flag patches.They were in Military fatigues and seemed eerily quiet, almost as if while walking they were called to attention and floated down the hallway.They entered the room, like ghosts.> 
> 	Pleasure Agent, sit, we have something a little different planned for today.I want you to understand that anything said here goes under the standard guidelines.This Is all Top Secret with repercussions that go beyond your time here in the CIA. The old Asian man ignored his handshake and sat down closing the door as he entered the room.> 
> 	The two men at his sides taking other chairs across the table.The first who had brown eyes pulled the power plug of the TV, and sat down.The Blue eyes of the other, burned into the side of Jormundsons head as he sat down, and continued his stare.Brown eyes seemed tired, and crossed his arms and closed his eyes.He seemed to be listening very intently, he then sat down murmuring Damn NSA.> 
> 	Jeremy crossed his hands on the table, speaking with reserve and a steady voice.Weve brought you here today to brief you on a job opportunity, that if accepted will put you in a very small group of interesting individuals. He gazed at Jormundson who by now seemed thoroughly confused.> 
> 	I dont remember signing up for a new position, I do however remember that I have a report due on the Japanese Self Defense Force that wont write itself. Jormundson had regained his composure and was now getting annoyed at being led through this strangeness.He wanted to get through with it and get writing, so he could get home early for a change.> 
> 	Jeremy continued, uninterested with his irate tablemates report, Youre a lot like your father, before we poached him from The Swedish Lightning. He smiled at the puzzled look that immediately flashed across his face.> 
> 	My father was a postmaster in Duluth, Minnesota until his dying day.So I wouldnt presume you knew my father. Jormundson rebutted, offended at the pretense.> 
> 	The old man gave out a small laugh and smiled.Oh I knew old Jormund well, he was the best in class in Sweden, but Sweden doesnt know war, so Sweden loses its best chess pieces. He put his hand flat on the table towards Jormundson who looked like he was about to get up and walk out.Did you ever wonder why a postmaster from Duluth would travel to Europe for government business?Did you ever wonder how a postmaster could afford to send his three sons to the most prestigious colleges?And then mysteriously disappear into Huron after a car crash on the Mackinac Bridge?
> 
> 	This was growing very unsettling for Jormundson who had just began to remember the solemn and quick and quiet funeral that the government had paid for.It was strange, though he said his teary goodbyes, it all felt so fast, almost as if there was no time or money for grieving.He had since grown to accept it since it was nearly twenty years ago now.It revived that wonder he had about why the Postmen always seemed nervous when he asked them what his fathers job was like at the office, since he was never allowed to go.> 
> 	Son, Im about to tell you something that about a hundred or more, or less, know in United States.We operate a small clandestine unit known as the Lincoln Brigade. He stared at Jormundson with a deadly serious look on his face.> 
> 	Jormundson wanted to laugh, but it was strange how serious these three men were being about this subject.To Jormundson the Lincoln Brigade was a volunteer group of Americans who fought in the Spanish Civil War, and nothing more.You mean like the Lincoln Brigade in Spain? offered Jormundson.> 
> 	This is where things get complicated son. Jeremy leaned back in his chair, tenting his fingers and then setting them on his arm rests.It is the same, and its not.We were founded at the behest of Lincoln during the Civil War, had we been there during his assassination we would have had our founder with us a little longer. He closed his eyes almost as if he was remembering that time himself.> 
> 	The LB were in Spain, alongside the Lincoln Brigade some drunk fool found the name from one of our more careless agents and loved it, though we are much older.But we were present there, and helped Franco become what he was, shame he didnt stay as faithful to us after the war. The implications of what Jeremy said were beginning to interest Jormundson.> 
> 	So, youre saying that Franco was a United States plot? Jormundson said asking the question with all the doubt one could show on ones face.> 
> 	Yes, when a political situation demands quick satisfaction, or a quick hand is needed to ensure the United States prospers, we can provide a quick answer.We dont do prolonged struggle, we tip the teetering pyramid in the direction it needs to go.
> 
> 	So, you are a bunch of assassins? Jormundson seemed puzzled by strange interspersed vagueness in a lot of the words.You guys are a bunch of Yankee Ninjas?
> 
> 	Not ninjas, the Japanese paid dearly and still do for letting that get out.They had them first, but they were merely a prototype.They dont call them that anymore.
> 
> 	What do they call them now? Jormundson asked.> 
> 	The Hyaku, or the One Hundred. Jeremy said matter-of-factly, and there are many more in the world.The Russian Tyeni, and the Chinese YinYing, both have their home in the Russian Revolution, coming from the Tsarist Okhrana.The Germans never believed in them and paid for it at the end of WWII, Hitler didnt kill himself son.The Tyeni made sure of that. Jeremy offered each tidbit as though it were a reward for continued interest in the conversation, and Jormundson was biting.> 
> 	Jormundson could hardly believe the things he was hearing, being that they flew in the face of conventional knowledge.He knew a lot that the public didnt, but this was really left field for even a Secret level CIA conference.> 
> 	Jeremy continued The Indian Svajas face off nearly daily with the Pakistani Uqaab, These Japanese Hyaku face with the South Korean Gonghwadang Geulimja the North Korean Bulg-eun Geulimja, we just call them Gongs and Bulgans for short.
> 
> 	Communist Ninjas? Jormundson asked puzzled by how that sounded.> 
> 	Yeah, Communist Ninjas. Jeremy smiled at the naive question.We dont have an Ideology Jormundson, they are something any country can come up with given enough time. Jeremy finished the point before he continued on.Norway has the lvers, and Sweden the tndande.Lver is Norwegian for Lion, Son. Brown eyes who has been quiet since his entrance earlier let out a chuckle.Blue eyes blinked, in what Jormundson was sure was the first time he had done so since they got here.> 
> 	Your father was the best the tndande ever had, and they paid him well, but it was a boring life in Sweden.I met him in Hong Kong, having just having been released from The Royal Army and her majestys service, and recently brough on by the LB in the US.We knew about him, and I approached him with an offer, he took it and moved to Minnesota. Jeremy began to speak a little less seriously, and seemingly more personal.He was a good man, but in the Lincoln Brigade he was involved against the Soviet Tyeni, and got a bit too deep.They evened out the score on Mackinac Bridge twenty years ago. Jeremy said this so matter of factly, it threw off Jormundson completely again.>
