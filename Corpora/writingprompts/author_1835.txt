Dana slammed her tray on the table.Not so much out of anger, but from a complete lack of caring.It'd been hard to find the energy to do much -- including being gentle with her lunch -- ever since she arrived here.It took her half a day to realize what had happened, how she'd been captured and why she'd been dumped in this pit.Rage consumed her for the first twenty four hours, followed quickly by helplessness, and now a justifiable depression."It'll get better," Julie offered as she sat down across the table.Dana had no desire to continue discussing the situation.She had no desire to do much of anything.But she had to talk to someone, and her options were limited."This isn't how my life was supposed to go.""You and me both, little girl."Julie's voice was light and without rasp.It always caught Dana off-guard that a woman so old, who'd spent most of her life trapped in these walls, could maintain something that sounded like optimism."But it won't always be like this."Dana shook her head."You said no one's escaped.Never even been released on parole.And it doesn't sound like that's changing anytime soon."Julie's eyes revealed no emotion but empathy."It's harder for you.I can see that.Successful thief who never faced a pinch you couldn't slip away from.Damn, even when you found out you were coming to this Hell-on-Earth, you figured it was only a matter of time before you were out again.How many centers have you busted out of?""They never even got me to the facilities," Dana said with a touch of pride."And you didn't think they were going to figure out that you're a Lucky eventually?That they'd eventually send the service after you?You're too smart for that."Dana just shook her head.She knew Julie was right, but that wasn't what really bothered her."But this place..." she gestured aimlessly around her.Julie nodded."No light.No field time.The food isn't worthy of swine and the guards are going to make you hate every day of your life.But it'll get better.""How?How is that possible?""Not for us."Now Julie couldn't help but keep a small tremor out of her voice."Little girl, this is our fate, I'm afraid.But for the others like us, it won't always be like this.Living in fear that once they discover you're a 100, they'll lock you up and throw away the key.It's a story as old as time itself.Damn near every civilization since we were walkin' and talkin' has done it to someone else -- a different religion, just looking different, or simply being born in the wrong part of the world.People persecute what they're afraid of.Always have, always will."Dana shook her head."I don't understand.""We were to born before the world understands and accepts the Lucky.But humans change.They learn.It takes them sometime and they often make a damn mess of it along the way."You and I, little girl, we're going to suffer.But maybe a guard becomes sympathetic, or a warden has a change of heart.Maybe our story gets out, the world finds out about this place and what we went through.Then things will change -- they always do -- and it'll get better for the other Luckies out there."A banging rang out and reverberated off the small rooms steel walls.It was one of the guards, standing on an observation deck above them, banging his gun on the metal railing."Mess is over!To your spots!"Dana and Julie stood up.The lights in the dining room started dimming as the two prisoners prepared to leave.No reason to wait -- after all, they were the only inmates there."Why us, Julie?"She wouldn't see her again for another day, not until their next meal, and her heart ached for some sort of wisdom.But Julie only shrugged as she looked Dana in the eye."Bad luck."\--------------------
