At first, the aliens came in hordes.Wiped out everyone and everything they sensed a heart beat in.I lost my whole family within days, my father was the first to go protecting my older brother, then my mum protecting both of us.My brother and I were on the run for months until we got sloppy, stayed in the same place too long and he died protecting me.Somehow started a fire and took out 6 of those bastard aliens at once, made me proud to be related to him.That was 2 years ago, Ive been alone ever since..The blood curdling screams of those found make it hard to sleep, the goosebumps that used to cover my skin everytime I heard that scream dont appear anymore but the knowledge of what is happening to those screaming is a horror in its own.In an effort to drown out those screams I remind myself of the golden rule, move to a new spot every 3 days.When that doesnt work I focus on my surroundings and close my eyes,I can almost see my surroundings identically in my head.I close my eyes and hope to get some rest for tonight, tomorrow is when I find a new spot..I jolt upright, I swear I heard a noise.Everything in the room I slept in has moved around, somethings been here.I get up slowly, crouch low and move around the house.Searching each and every room, i feel different.As if I feel that the room is empty before turning into it.Through my travels Ive bumped into other people, traded items, bought weapons and been given food.Ive also heard stories of survivors manifesting powers, magic even.The ability to summon storms or move water, throw fire or read minds.After determining the house is safe I sit down and close my eyes.I picture the house in my mind and focus as hard as I can.A blueprint like imagine appears in my mind, turning and growing, a 3D image replica of the layout.I can see myself sitting next to the tv, my mind zooms into the room in in.This is some crazy shit, I wonder what else I can do.I picture the tv next to me exploding and I focus as hard as I can.BOOM.Kid!Kid!Wake up!
Struggling, I wake up but keep my eyes closed.Fuck that was dumb, blowing up the tv right next to myself yeah, nice one idiot.Oh thank god hes awake, he blew up a tv next to himself I can see the young girl sitting next to me, another man pacing in the corner of the room and another, older female sitting down in a chair.I try to open my eyes and the searing pain becomes obvious in my left eye.Glass cut your eye pretty deep, hit the cornea and maybe sliced some nerves.I was only a nursing student so Im not too sure the girl says apologetically, I look at her with my right eye and ask her how she knew I blew the tv up, her mother tells me her daughter was a mute her whole life but a couple of months ago she talked for the first time, but it wasnt with her mouth.It was with her mind.Shes telepathic.They tell me theyve heard of a colony of people that are gaining powers in the north and that they are heading there, Im welcome to go with them....
