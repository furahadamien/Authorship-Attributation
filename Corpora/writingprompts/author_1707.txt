"They're made out of water.""Water?""Water.They're made out of water.""...water?""There's no doubt about it.We picked up several from different parts of the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, and probed them all the way through.They're mostly water.""So, does this planet have all 5 elements?Is that how they're able to be water?""Nope.Just 4.This world has no magic.""Wait, you mean to tell me this is a world filled with water creatures but no magic?How do they stay together?""Apparently they're held together in vessels filled with meat.""Oh don't start with that 'sentient meat' thing again.I got the last report from previous scouts in this sector.I'll believe them for now, but I have a hard time believing of sentient WATER.""It's the same creatures.""You're fucking kidding.""I'm not.""HOW CAN A CREATURE BE MADE OF BOTH SENTIENT MEAT AND WATER?""Evidently the meat is powered by flowing rivers of water and iron, pumped through a main reactor in their chest.If they run out of water, they die.""This is ludicrous!You're telling me we found a world that is absent of magic elements but has sentient meat/water creatures?""Yes.""Okay.Fine.I'll... Take what I can in stride.So, what do they consume?There has to be some magical energies leftover from the colonization wars.""They consume water, meat, and various plants grown from the ground.""...No seriously.""I'm only telling you what I observed.""How in the everloving FUCK do they consume water?It's one of the most dangerous substances in this universe!""Look, we didn't evolve the same way they did.Maybe their proximity to water caused them to require it on a regular basis.""I got it.I got it.It must be the plants!The plants give off some kind of magical essence that allows them to consume water.""No, they eat the plants for fiber, meat for protein, and water to keep themselves hydrated.""...without magic?""Without magic.""...I don't believe this.""Believe it or don't!This planet, apparently filled with meat life forms also has water flowing through them every day.There's even beings that live in the water.""Live?IN WATER?""Yup.We sent a probe down there... Well, as far as it could go before disintegrating... And found several life forms just swimming in it.""NO MAGIC?""I'm telling you!No magic!They exist not only with water, consuming water, but also living in water.""Meat in water...This is...This is too much.""What should we do?""File a follow up report to the previous one.Send it back to base.""Really?Do you think they'll accept it?""Fuck no.You kidding me?They'll just file it in the back with the previous report.Nobody really wants to visit the planet that rains water, do they?""Definitely not.""Then it's decided.Write up the report.""What's our next destination?""Prep the ship to jump to sector TB66.At least it has magic to explain why life forms can exist alongside water.""What element are they missing?""Apparently they live on a planet of fire, but no earth.Their plants can grow using air and fire, but they only just discovered water as a weapon.""Well of course, what else would you use water for?""Exactly why nobody wants to come back to this planet.""Indeed."- With all apologies to Terry Bisson
