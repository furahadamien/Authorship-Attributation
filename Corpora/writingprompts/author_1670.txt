I did not know my gram was a witch, the demon that I summoned had to tell me!The day started of normal enough to about as normal as you can get when your about to go to a funeral.Gram was so happy and full of energy few bays ago you wouldve never know that it was going to be her last day on earth.But here i was in my best clothes ready to go to the funeral of the best women there was.I sat in my bed and stared at the ceiling for about an hour thinking on all the good memories me and Gram had together, she was a great cook all her food tasted delicious I always looked forward to our visits to her house because of her food it was her secret recipes that were passed down though the family the aromas that came from her dishes I felt my mouth drool just from the memory.my mom then called for me snapping me back Tom are you ready your uncle is already here with the car I reluctantly got up from my bed and yelled that I was coming down and began to make my way down stairs passing all the pictures of my Dad and Gram, when I got to the front door I came face to face with the most vile, vicious, disgusting, greedy, creepy, and evil being known to man.He was other was know as my uncle.
