He knew full well, this action would be his last.His very existence erased as a result.Everything he's loved or cared for, sought after.. only to exist as a time to be forgotten.Yet he knew what he must do.He fixed his gaze, ahead of him - a blank canvas.He applied his brush, but what he put there did not matter.If he succeeded in imprinting his innate connection with art onto Hitler, than Hitler would precede his success with his very talent.The contributions of Bob Ross would become trivial in a world far ahead of his time.While he knew not what would become of him he knew that he would no longer be himself.That is how it was, written in the very fabric of the universe.The thought of this fate triggered something deep within, a will which succeeded his own.He made his stroke, and the brush cast a scene of humanity joining together to celebrate in the glory of their civilization.He turned to Hitler ...And he was nowhere to be found.Rushing to the door he stopped by the mirror, and he found that it was true.He was Hitler all along.
