Santa costumes are the worst.The beard always itches me.Cant wait for my daughter to grow up to the point she doesnt believe in Santa Claus and Unicorns anymore.Until then I guess I will have to pay my dues.Seeing Sarahs smile and the happiness in her eyes when she is woken up by Santa makes up for all of this.I wake up groggy and tired already wishing there was a double espresso shot in my hand.I have to be extra careful to not wake up Sarah by making any noises in the kitchen.If only my archaic coffee machine didnt make a sound of a lawnmower while brewing!I get out of my bed finally and jump into my slippers and go straight into the shower.One of the only benefits of being a fatass is I can easily pull off being a Santa.I have a nice beer belly going so thats always a plus.For a moment I almost feel proud of myself looking into the mirror at my naked body.I feel ashamed at myself the very next moment though.The amount of money I have spent on gym memberships would have easily covered my Hawaii trip... a dozen times.I decide to not wallow in self pity at least today.Its Christmas afterall.Jesus didnt die for this!A few minutes later I am in my Santa suit, looking legit as fuck.I wish TV shows showed a black Santa every once in a while though.Sarah is onto me.Last Christmas she had asked me, Is North Pole near the Sun? My 6 year old is outwitting her 44 year old father.Such days have come.I pick up my Santa bag, filled with all the gifts from Sarahs wish list.Well, all but one.Didnt have enough money to buy her a pony. I did create a GoFundMe campaign for this supported with a very emotional touching story about how Sarah has always wanted a pony ever since she learnt to speak.I guess it was too late as I got beat by 23 other dads posting the same campaign.None of us got a penny.I want to blame the society and not myself for not fulfilling my daughters dreams.Im a sad petty man.Anyway, to get Sarah off my back, I told her to write a letter to Santa and he will see about that pony.And Santa can always say he got her a pony but had to use it for himself because one of his reindeers caught cold.I love how easy it is to fool children.Im certainly not in the contest for dad of the year award.As soon as I begin walking towards Sarahs room and do my Ho!Ho!Ho! santa impression, I hear someone knocking on the main door.Is Santa really here? is the first thing that comes to my mind.Who else should I be expecting at almost 4 on a cold snowy Christmas morning?I put down my bag, and climb down the stairs to check on the unexpected visitor.I peek through the peephole, and all I see is a giant horse looking straight at me.A sane person would call police or animal control at this point.But not this guy.I yell Is there anybody out there? from behind the doors and wait for a response.After 5 mins of waiting, curiosity gets the best of me and I open the door as slowly as I can.Afraid that I would startle the horse, I take baby steps maintaining my gaze.Who the fuck must have parked his horse on my lawn in the middle of night is beyond me?!I close in on the horse and see a letter of some kind tied to his collar.I unhook the letter and read out its content:

> *Miss Sarah Lawrence,
> 
>  I hope this letter finds you in bad health.I received your letter asking me for a pony.Well we dont have ponies in hell as they are hella cute.And cute is not an adjective we want our world to be associated with.But what we do have is this horse.His name is Zeus.Please take care of him or whatever I dont care.We had an extra one lying around so Im sending Zeus to you.He can be especially useful while roasting korean bbq chicken wings.> 
> Insincerely,
> Satan*

As I finish reading through the letter, and before I even get a chance to react to what has been a very strange night so far, Zeus turns to me and the next second, my Santa beard is on fire.
