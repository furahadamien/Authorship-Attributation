It was time.There was no higher point in life.Charlie knew the sage had been right, we contrast our highest highs against our lowest lows, and Charlie never thought much about the red line until then.Now he couldn't stop thinking about it.How good could life get if he only let a little of the bad in?Now was the time to start living.He took a step, this time on the red line, it crossed the street and led down the sidewalk.He lifted his head and began walking.Nothing was happening, so he walked some more.This was so unlike the green line, which tended to operate rather quickly.So Charlie checked his path to make sure he hadn't accidentally begun to walk the green line out of habit.Then panic set in.The lines were gone.
