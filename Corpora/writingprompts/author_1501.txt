I have always tried to look on the positive side of things.Sure I had no family, but I had a lot of time for my hobbies.Sure I had to work with heavy machinery, but the pay was good and I enjoyed the labor.Even when the incident happened I tried to stay optimistic.Yes I lost my arm, but I got a big compensation and could live without working for the rest of my life.What would sulking help anyway?I would rather travel the world and find new experiences.My life had changed the day of accident, but I did my best to direct the change in a positive direction.Apparently, more than half of amputees experience phantom pains - the sensations in a missing limb.I had those too, even though they were not always pains, sometimes my missing arm would just itch of feel uncomfortable, as if stuck in an awkward pose.It was during one of my travels when things started getting a bit crazy.As I was visiting Russia of all places, I've heard a rumor about some old abandoned hospital, called Horwino, that apparently was haunted.There were stories about secret experiments, sects, suicides.I was never into this kind of stuff before, but decided to give it a try.With some locals who acted as guides we visited the place - the massive building did have a creepy atmosphere, but we didn't see anything supernatural.When we were there I got another case of phantom pains though - my missing arm would feel cold and heavy.At the time I figured it was due to chilling Russian winter.But in the next few weeks it only got worse.I would have trouble sleeping, constantly take anesthetics and feel very tired.One night I woke up in the middle of the night sweaty, groggy and with a strong pain.What I saw instantly sobered me up, as some dimly shining blue silhouette of a person was gripping the place where my limb used to be and causing the pain I was feeling.Without thinking about it, I swiped at the thing with my fist, but it went right through it.Acting on a reflex I followed up the right punch with a left and somehow, this one actually landed.I guess the entity itself did not expect it because it recoiled from the punch and vanished in thin air.Turns out a missing hand has some uses as well.However, my victory did not last - a week after being beaten the ghost came back.At first I would only see it out of the corner of my eye, but a month ago it started attacking me again.So far I managed to wrestle it off with my phantom arm, but I don't feel too confident.I don't know what it wants or why it haunts me, but I'm not sure I can overpower it next time when the only thing I can use against it is my phantom arm.Since I first saw this ghost I have been going to every occult specialist I could find, but not only they weren't able to help me, they didn't even see the ghost when it came for me.I am trying to stay optimistic, but I am running out of options.Today I will be spending a night with a famous exorcist.It will cost me a lot, but the other option is worse.If this guy will not be able to help me, I will have to take matters into my own hands.This time I will actually be losing a limb on purpose...
