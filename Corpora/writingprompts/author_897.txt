I finished tying the mans shoelaces together and stood back, waiting for the inevitable flow of time to resume.I had heard a scream behind me, and just after that happened, time stopped.The older I was getting, the better I was getting at realising it was happening- although it was easier in busy streets when all the bustle and noise of a big city suddenly turned off.It was rather chilling the first few times it had happened.Can you imagine it?A city with thousands around you, silent.Dead silent.You don't realise how unerving it is until you go through it.Hell, if it didn't happen on an almost weekly basis, I'd probably put it down to some sort of psychosis myself.I could make it tangible though.Once you got used to it.You could have fun with it.Empty a beer a mate was holding, or put someones hat onto someone else.I never overstepped lines though- I didn't have the constitution to do that kind of stuff.I was always a little too "nice" for my own good.Even though people wouldn't believe it.I told my best friend, Sally, and she just couldn't shake the feeling that I'd do something to her in those moments- It felt really good to know a friend saw you that way.So she now just keeps well away from me.I don't tell anyone about my secret now, and just have my tiny little bits of fun.This was different now, this was a situation where I could actually use my power for good.Hell, If I couldn't actually control when I was stopping time, I could still try and use it for good, right?I noticed the man running from a woman who had been recently knocked to the ground, and he was holding a bright pink bag, it was pretty easy to surmise what had happened here.So now, I sit here and I wait.Time started, and the man's right leg pushed forward- but not as far as he was expecting.That glorious fall began- but then it didn't.Time froze again.Odd, this had never happened before, it was never this close to another freeze.Sometimes they happened twice in a day, but never one straight after another...

Movement

I turned my head... something had moved in the corner of my eye.Where was it.I began searching the crowds, looking for that movement again.Did someone else share my powers?How had I never seen someone in 12 years?Stay still and search.There.I started running."Hey you wait!!!You can move too.WAIT!!"Time started again, the street came alive.I heard people shouting at the man, who had now definitely fallen over, but I didn't care anymore.I had to follow the woman in a green jumper.I needed answers...

She weaved in between people, it was dificult to keep up, She was fast, and I was only of average fitness."WAIT!!"PLEASE!!!!"People were looking at me, but I didn't care.I needed to talk to her.She turned down a side street, and I followed after her.Big mistake.Something collided with my face, and it was hard.I heard my nose crunch, and I dropped to the ground.It was all too much, and the black swallowed me.-----

This is my first story I've written.If you want me to continue let me know.I have to run out the house for a bit but I will continue it if anyone wants me to in a few hours.
