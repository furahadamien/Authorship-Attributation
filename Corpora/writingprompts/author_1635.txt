After finishing up a fresh cup of Joe and waking and baking some sensimeli (a lot) nuggets.It dawned to examine the closet in a attempt to find your old blue jeans and hoodie, clearly your preferred attire for the cool fall weather that just seasoned in like a salt and pepper shaker hard at work.The first thing you find on top is those old VR goggles you got once upon a time, you notice the brand deeply printed "lily of the how he" on the shiny finish.After pondering such a weird brand name you decided to see if they still fit your fully grown head, low and behold the strap was broken.Then you made the realization those cheap bastards,  no wonder I don't remember these damn things they wouldn't even strap on fresh out of the sales cube.B-)()\_()_/
