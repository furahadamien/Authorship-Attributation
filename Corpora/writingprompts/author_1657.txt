The demon seemed somewhat taken aback by Adam's response."Well obviously you've failed at that" it said appearing to collect itself and calm down a little.Apparently, he thought, being summoned was quite rage inducing.Adam empathised with the demon.After all maybe it was in the middle of a challenging game of tennis, or had just won the money hand at strip poker with a particularly lively blonde bombshell.Demons could be hot blondes, that made sense, being hell and all.Right?Adam's side-tracked thoughts kept him from really paying attention to the demon's critique of his chicken soup.Adam thought he'd heard half of a rant about how you really shouldn't be using bloody goat steaks in chicken soup and neither the devil's wort herb nor the eye of newt (apparently a nickname for peppercorns?)were not standard ingredients either.This really didn't bother him, last time something like this happened he met Trafengalore the Dragon, Lord Supreme of the 12th Plane of Torment.Cool guy, not big on inside voices but he was really helpful in getting Adam back to Earth.Word of advice folks, walking to your kitchen can be hazardous when you're not a clever man."Anyways kid.My name is Shaghfrl'ee the Gluttonous.I'd love to help you out with this chicken soup deal you've got going on here."Adam thanked him, grateful for the assistance.Two hours later the kitchen had an amazing smell wafting around as the two ate a spectacular chicken soup.Shaghfrl'ee was apparently kind of awesome at cooking.

*The mind plays tricks.* That's what Dr. Robertson always told me.This couldn't be real.Real people can't speak in your mind."It's weird isn't it?Nice to finally meet you" she said.*Gotta give the mind credit, it can make them look real.* She seemed pretty, but I knew she couldn't be real."I am too real silly" it said blushing.*They always lie.*

"It?"Mr. Robertson was going to up the meds again.I've never had visual hallucinations like this before.The mirage seemed to deflate.The voice began pleading to be taken seriously but I ignored it.I didn't need this today.*They can make themselves feel real, but they aren't.Don't listen to them.*

What John could not hear was Megan's tears hitting the sidewalk.It's a very soft sound.
