I guess it's unlucky to be born lucky, and vice versa.What do tests know anyway?Flipping a coin in front of a kid, how can that really tell anything?Yeah, sure, here in prison we're the lucky ones; not the rich brats born in good circumstances with everything handed to them, but us -- the "Lucky" Ones.Maybe it's yet another test, to see if we're lucky enough to escape.Sure, guards drop their keys from time to time, and we have all the resources to make tools and weapons, but that's likely by design, as part of the test.Myself, I don't care anymore.They want to pay for me to have free room and board for life, I'll take it.Heck, maybe I'm lucky after all, not starving to death on the overcrowded streets.Too bad I didn't commit a crime to be in prison though, give me the address of the guy who made the test and maybe I might.But here I am, stuck in a cage for no real reason, good freaking grief.
