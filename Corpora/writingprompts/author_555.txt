My kids had given me over of those "#1 Dad" mugs for father's day a few years back.I thought it was cute, used it from time to time for my morning coffee (mostly when my "better half" mug was in the dishwasher).I heard this strange story on the radio after dropping my son of at school in the morning: apparently, all those mugs had changed all over the world to show some other number.I kinda thought it was weird, but carried on with my day: going to work, pick up my younger son from daycare, help the two older ones with their homework, cook dinner, ...The next morning, my "better half" mug was still in the dishwasher.As usual, I'd gotten up early, baked our daily home-made bread while my actual better half was starting up another laundry, took a shower, woke the kids.When I set the table, I took my"#1 dad" cup for my morning coffee.Of course, those stories hadn't been true: it still said "#1 Dad", just like it always had...
