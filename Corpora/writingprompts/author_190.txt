Ninjacon 2017 was an interesting one.They all were.Ninjas from all over the world in one place.Holding it in a secret basement of a hotel hosting an anime convention was a stroke of genius.Those japanese ninjas had been right, to hide a tree: use a forest.But thier time had passed.They did'nt change with the times.Those who hired them knew how to find them.The international association of Ninja.The Australian Ninjas were the best in the world, thier mastery of deadly creatrues and harsh terrain made them the most expensive.The Japanese ninja had fractured into the traditionalists (what normies think of ninja) and the flashy ones who wore orange.Nobody ever expected Spanish Ninjas or the Canadian ones (they would apologize as they killed you, often by force feeding you maple syrup and poutine until your stomach burst).With the new assassins creed games more people expected the Arabic, Italian and even the American Ninjas.It was at the secret ninja bar that they would trade stories."I say olaf, did you see yesterday's episode of Game of Thones?Cracking show eh Wot!, asked Nigel.Everyone knew about MI 6 and James Bond, but the queen's personal Ninjas were Britians true strength.Olaf Magnussen, a blonde bear of a man laughed "Yes,  I do believe that Ned Stark Fellow will"

Suddenly a knife appeared in his heart as he crumpled over.A little girl with freckles and red hair glared at him "fer fook's sake ye daft coont.Enough with the spoilers."Nigel shook his head distastefuly."Mary, you git!You can't keep doing that.It's bloody inconvientent for the cleaning staff."Irish ninjas.Typical really.Her face flushed red as she figured out what Nigel was thinking."I'll fite you mate!"At another table  Pierre and Jack were arguing."ee's impossible, zere is no such thing as Mexican Ninjas,  you've been drinking too much."Pierre argued."no one has ever seen one and they never show up."Nah man.I tell you bro.My uncle got killed by one.They are real Give them a shot of tequila and they like teleport and shit.I know a guy who'd roomate's nephew saw one. "Logan wandered over "sorry to interupt but I could'nt help overhearing.I heard that one once got elected to office.I forget which one.But my grandma plays pinochile with a lady who's dentist's former roomate once saw one kill a man with a taco from a mile away. "Logan wandered off.Pierre looked over at Jack."'ave you gotten zose taco trucks on every corner yet.Jack shook his head "not yet, leaders say a lot are slow to deliver.He patted his back pocket to realize his wallet was missing."has anyone seen my wallet?He asked.The maid passing by answered "No.No.."  thinking to herself "I take"

There was no way she was ever getting a pony...I mean the cost and where would we put it.Yeah my aunt has a farm but really...Besides who buys their kid a pony?Not people who work for a living... 
Daddy, I wrote Santa a letter, I dropped it in the box while I was shopping with mom.
I looked at Beth's eager face, her hopeful eyes, Santa never came through for me, I almost opened my mouth to tell her there is no Santa but stopped... 
Do you think he'll bring me a pony? I smiled...
Sweetie, I don't know, How would it fit in the sleigh.
I sighed, better leave it at that.Maybe the giant Pinkie Pie plushie would satisfy her..

Christmas morning, I awoke to the expected  joyful houts of It's christmas!It's Christmas!  I looked over at my wife, who was wiping sleep from her eyes, and we both braced for the inevitable wasteland of shredded wrapping paper..

That was when we were both surprised by a loud neighuing sound on the lawn.Oh, Daddy!You got me a pony?  Beth ran outside not even bothering to put on her winter clothes...I looked over at Ann.was that you idea?  She shook her head No.Was it your's?'No.We talked about it.We all made our way outside to investigate when what we saw stopped us in our tracks.A stallion, but one with a flaming mane, and puffs of smoke billowing from it's nostrils.It snorted and scraped the earth and the snow around it melted..

what the fu..... I cut my self short.Beth was cowering behind the snowman... Daddy...It's a scarry horse..  I calmly walked up to it, and put a hand on the saddle,inside the saddlebag was a large black envelope.The horse lay down on the ground.I turned the thick envelope over in my hands It looked normal, but...Wait.. Was that smell sulfur... Brimstone too.The outside was plain except for To Beth from Satan..

WWHHHHHHAAAAAAAATTTTTTTT  I  exclaimed.. Honey, come take a look at this.We opened the envelope, several sheets detailing horse care and liniages and many other reems of paper were inside, including a handwritten note on elegant stationary: 

Dear Beth,

	First off a couple of things.I'm not in the favor business.Especially not for what you were offering me, which was nothing.I'm not the type to care about good grades and that you did'nt punch Jimmy Katz for being a meanie to you.I'd appreciate it if you gave him a swift kick to the... Well you know.Look, I'm not a nice guy, I mean, Ultimate Evil and all that.Secondly, I do not enjoy receiving mail intended for Saint Nick.I really don't care for that fat bastard, 
I mean he works for my nemesis and I get a bunch of his letters from kids who don't know how to spell( happens quite often this time of year and usually I shove them up Adolf or Judas's...Wait.You get the idea.JC is still cheesed at me about the rampant consumerism that distract people from his birthday and makes a sappy hallmark parody of one of his favorite saints" at least the Krampus had Style and was't about people getting married.Blech..The Grinch, was doing great until he fumbled the ball two minutes left on the clock(same as scrooge..)

	Well normally I would ignore letter such as this I have decided to make an exception.It turns out I have a horse that needs a new home.I know it's not quite what you asked for ( we really don't keep many horses down here Pegasai and Unicorns can't stand the climate )but I think you'll enjoy it.I could not give you a purebred nightmare as they do not tolerate the atmosphere outside of hell too well.So this should be the next best thing, it's name of is up to you.The horse is part nightmare and mostly mortal horse.Officially it's an Arabian stallion of impressive lineage tracing its Heritage back to horses used by Vlad the Impaler, Saladin, Genghis Khan, Ramses II, Santa Anna,  and this one Middle Eastern warlord whose name I forget right now  ( I think it started with an m he was popular some time ago) despite his fearsome heritage you couldnt  ask for a nicer horse.He's friendly and a good conversationalist .The flames on his main are really just red hair when the light hits it he's well-tempered and won't hurt you unless you fall off but that's what saddles are for.Otherwise he's just like a normal horse, though not immortal he should live a good 40 50 years.He likes apples and he eats grass do not feed him flaming hot Cheetos or ghost peppers or anything too spicy he gets fire breath as you will see.It will pass eventually.While I was writing this letter he ate five pallets of cheetos..I think Osama is better suited to be cereberus's chew toy than watching the stable... 

My one daughter is going off to college and can't take care of him anymore .We hope you enjoy him
From your  letter you seemed a nice enough girl (messy penmanship and poor spelling but nice enough..)so I figure he's in Better hands with you.by the way I consider it a favor that you will take good care of him so we are even on that.Enter him in all kinds and shows and races.Especially encourage you to enter him in the Triple Crown when he comes of age( maybe he'll fix the lack of real talent in that race).Best Wishes,

Lucifer Satan,
Prince of Darkness, Father of Lies, The Roaring Lion....

The devil sat lounging in his office, his feet propped on a couple of sinners serving as an ottoman.A lit cigar smouldered between his fingers as his other claw gripped a tumbler of whiskey.An imp gushed praise at his infernal master 
Boss your Brilliance knows no bounds you've made a lifelong satanist of a little girl and her family, and any children she will have and when it wins show upon show and the Triple Crown it will bring glory to your infernal name also you have further mocked the enemy's birthday.

The Devil threw back his head and laughed.Nah I just wanted that damned horse out of here.I'm tired of listening to it sing the theme song to that damn cartoon my daughter was obsessed with for a while she saw that cartoon and wanted her own candy colored horse.That song is too cheerful, even for a torture...  She would not shut up about the rainbows and the ponies and the friendship.I'm not a goddamn horse breeder , then she went off to college and was is over it.That damned  horse is her problem now.
