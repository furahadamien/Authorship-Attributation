I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but it's hardly sane to act like I'm not."Steven, seriously, I don't know anything about it," I lied as he shook a neatly wrapped package closer toward my face."SATAN," his voice pitched up, "it says it's from Satan, ***honey***, and we can't call the police why?!What kind of sick prank is this, to send a little girl...that.. that MONSTER!?What even is it, why does this cockadoodle stuff keep hapening to us!?I can't anymore with this...with YOU!Jesus..."

"Oh, calm down ***Steve***," I managed to snatch the package away from him before he stormed off petulantly to hide in the bathroom, and scream into a towel.It was the coping mechanism of a coward.And well, I guess I'm a liar, but with the way he hid from everything it didn't exactly make it easy to be honest.I could hear Penny crying in the livingroom as I made my way back down the hall from our bedroom.She tried to hide it when I sat next to her on the couch, but it hardly made a difference with how red her cheeks had gotten."This one's for me," I sat the package down on the coffee table, "but do you wanna open it?"She looked up at me with the usual skepticism she had when I was doing something her step dad disagreed with."Go ahead," I gave her the smile that only we shared.The kind that said I didn't care if we got in trouble.We ARE trouble.She didn't hesitate after that, and like all children quickly discarded the note for me to read.---


**To: My Dearest Sarah, "with an H",*

*First, my apologies.I may have committed an itsy bitsy little federal crime by sending someone to change the spelling on Pen's address line, my bad.To be fair, you were the one trying to trick her into writing, "Santa"- like that obese old blowhard would actually bring her anything.* 

*Anyway, you know I can't pass up such a convincing, and frankly, well written letter.The way she so eloquently made her argument- she really is your kid, huh?Bet you're just- oh, how did you always put it, "proud as a opossum"?*

*So, I'm guessing average ole' steady job Steve is already in the crapper feeling sorry for himself about this whole situation (which is, by the way, why only you and Pen can see the letter).Anyway, tell him to stick a thumb in it.Penny earned this one.Straight A's all year, and the way she told off that self righteous little nose picker bully tormenting her best bud, she's something special.No wonder she doesn't get along with that white bread, economy car driving, watches the news for fun, Steven.What, with his fetish for bland food, and dry conversation, and all.*

*Honestly, I can't remember why you think you enjoy being around him?(...Yeah yeah, not my place, I know.)Anyway, give Pen a hug for me, and tell her the nightmare's name is 'Hank', and it's non-negotiable (seriously, that's all she'll answer to).*

*Warmest Regards,*

***Luci***

I couldn't help but hold my hand over my growing smile as I read it.There was something, I dunno, endearing about Lucifer being doating.Of him being jealous.Over Steven of all people- who, yes, was still in the bathroom.Penny was watching me, hopefully clutching the contents of the package- a key, " there's a tag."She handed it over to me with a sly smile.--*For: Sarah.Don't think I forgot about you!And, don't forget, my offer always stands.Merry Xmas -Luci*--

"What's it go to?"Penny returned our secret smile.A crooked, cute, little challenge."I'm sure it's gonna be trouble," I smirked back."Does that mean I can keep..." Pen furrowed her brow, "hmm, what should we call her.""Her name is Hank," I turned to look at the nightmare whose fiery breath was fogging up the window her face was pressed against just enough to obscure her unsettling gaze, "apparently it's non-negotiable.So, yeah, we can keep her.I'll deal with Steve."As Penny started to do jubilant laps around the house, and out the door into the snow (leaving it wide open), I ran my thumb over the ornate brass key.Thinking of how it reminded me of my promise, the deal with The Devil.Not to mention that offer of his.I guess it was alright for him to spoil Pen, first born and all, because of me she was kinda his too one way or another.I'd always thought he'd gotten an unfair shake, Satan, that is.He kept his promises, and he'd always been good to Pen.Good to me.What could it hurt to take him up on his offer, really?It was just a cup of coffee after all.Not a marriage proposal.My mind turned to the divorce papers that I'd already filled out waiting on the top shelf in my closet."Hey Pen, come and get dressed in something with short sleeves," I ushered her back into the house, Hank following us right to the edge of the threshold, "I think we gotta go see someone you owe a big, 'thank you' to for your present."Plus, I'd say I've earned a little trouble.
