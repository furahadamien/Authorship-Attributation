The king sat on his white throne.He sat in his white chair ran his fingers through his white hair.He took a puff of his cigar and blew out several white ohs then sucked the remaining white smoke into his white nostrils.I am never going to die.My body might, but I will live on.They will take about me for centuries.They will remember me.They will shake when they hear my name.They will bow to you.You are next in line, so you must carry on the name.You must continue the tradition, the Trump Tradition.
Father, I will do as you bid.
The kings hand was shaking.He hesitated while extending his arm, and he passed his cigar to his son.The son was strong.He looked at his father and smiled.He took the cigar and took his life.He shoved the cigar down his fathers throat and placed his hand over the fallen kings mouth suffocating him.He turned away and looked at the foxes surrounding the throne room.They laughed.They didnt care for their king.They didnt care for their new king.They were happy because they saw exactly what occurred before them.Only the foxes saw it happen.Only the foxes spread the new kings word.Only the foxes had power in the world.All the other predators had died when the old king came to power.He strangled them.He told lies to make them hunt each other.He spit and sang and danced when he got his way.His son planned to do the same.
