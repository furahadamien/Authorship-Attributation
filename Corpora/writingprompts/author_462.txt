Foreverending
The cameras where rolling in a few seconds and my tie was wrinkled.I patted it down and smiled, any moment now I would be featured on one of the largest FTL news network translated to 15 different alien languages.Thank you Grandpa."Ok, Thomas were going to go on in 5...4...3...2" I turn to look at the lovely pale Gristal and smile a gentle smile."1" 

"We are here today on the smallest yet most successful Galactic empire today.We are here on the single Terra-formed planet with the leader founder and king.Thomas Urban, how are you Thomas?"I nod in response "I'm doing fine, better now that I am here talking to you"

"We'll we are glad to have you.Now, most of our veiwers want to know how this all happened?How did you, a single human, own an entire intergalactic empire?"I keep up my small sincere smile and lean back in the chair giving me a relaxed look "Technically it's not an intergalactic empire, That would only be true if my territory expanded between two galaxies.What I have would at most probably be considered a Solar empire" I size her up as she shifts uncomfortably in her chair."But you want to know how I got around to owning an entire star" 

I take a deep breath and look straight at the camera for a second "It all started back in 2017 in human time, before we even left our home planet.My, many thousands of great, grandfather bought a little deed from a fake star naming company that claimed he owned it.Granted no one of that time accepted it to be true" I should have used good, True sounds to straightforward."Flash forward to 6509 only about a hundred years ago when an excavation team was going through old earth rubble and happened upon a safe, my grandfathers safe.In it they found the dead along with a very old book and several other knick knacks" Knick knacks is too loose get it together Thomas."The star as many of you know was in Zeg space who are very passive, a good quality if you want to use a several thousand year old contract to clam you have the rights on that star.That's what my dad did and unfortunately he died before the paperwork ever got processed" I wonder if I should shed a tear for that line."Anyway his last will and testament said that I now owned this star and that maybe I can do something with it.I was just a Clerk in AI town when I got the call from the lawer.Apparently when my dad left me he baecame quite the successful Captian"

"Intresting" The Gristal said to me "So you have a typical Rags to riches type story" She interupted me, I hope she doesn't do that again."Yes, I like to think of it like that, I had a random ball of plasma and five or six floating rocks so What was I going to do with it, Declare it a sovereign nation and creating my own laws" I wink to the camera."Well, what a nice story Thomas, What does the Galactic Union think about your little slice of paridise you have here?"I smile, finally something I can tell the truth about "Well they have been telling me all the benefits and positives of joining them, but half of the members don't even consider me an actual entity, but I filled out all the paper work.I am a nation by all accounts" 

"Intresting, We have a few interviews about diffrent members of the GU about your current status, is there anything you would like to say to them if you could?"She used that word again, why does she keep doing that?"I would just say, I'm a simple man and I just want to make money in these strange times."I smiled knowing full well that I just got on the subject of money.She might not notice it however."Speaking of money " Crap "You obviously are a very wealthy man Mr. Urban and I was wondering how you make that much money off of, you know a ball of plasma and 5 or 6 floating rocks" SHe was using my words against me, obviously for a laugh from the audience but I still hated it."Well all my dealings are classified since they are state secrets but I can say that I am a simple evasion of trade taxes if you will" That and I house at least 50 different wanted criminals in this sector."I make my own laws and people abide by those laws and that's all I do" 

"Interesting" Again with that word "Well I would love to ask you more questions about your little system here.Do you mind if we explore your home base here while I keep asking you questions?"I chuckle a bit "What are you hoping to find?No, they finished up an ocean just a few hundred miles south of us, we could check on that" I press the button encased in my hand, almost invisible to the human eye.Hopefully Greg will understand what the signal means and will get everyone out of there."That sounds wonderful Thomas, We will be right back to you after this quick break from our sponsors" I smile as the camera slowly pans back and millions of pounds of illegal cargo move to another discrete location.

"Oh come on with this stupid password crap," She says trying to sit down.I pull the chair away from her "No, You need to tell me the password, I want to keep things in line" 

She scrunches her face, and looks around "Durkenhimer"
 
"Not for fifteen more years sweety"

"Damn it" She glares at me as she takes out her backwards stopwatch "I hate you"

"Well, your stuck for all eternity with me" She disappears as her image degrades.I sit down and wait, I hit a stopwatch she gave me from the late 20 century, odd device from the looks of it.I turn it on and see how long it takes for me to remember everything.After about 28 seconds it came flooding back.I heard someone mention dog, connecting my dog back in Greece, talking to Aristotle finding treasure."Famous pianist Edvard Greg" I hear the distinct voice behind me and I come back to the present."Born just last month" She sits down, some sort of plastic cup in her hand "I used the stopwatch you gave me to see how late you were this time"

"Well, sorry, I had somewhere to get to"

"And you have a time machine, you should never be late" She chuckles in the small, sweet way only she could."You're ridiculous, Anyway, I properly recorded what happened to Hitler before I came here" I remember she told me a hundred years ago that Hitler was some sort of megalomaniac in the future."Oh interesting, What happened?"I loved her stories of the future and she always told them with such fervency.That is why I married her."Well he was in his bunker, hiding out from the oncoming troops, when all of the sudden, his nearest officer decided he had enough.Oh, it was so exciting, He pulled out a gun, said something roughly translated as "you monster, I vill keel you" " She laughed at herself and I smiled along with her "Then he shot Hitler, and then himself, don't you see this could change the course of history, prove those people who think he escaped to Argentina or something" I hardly heard what she said, as the gunshot still rang in my head.She kept telling her story, but I looked on with hollow eyes."You okay?"She said, taking another sip 

"Yeah, Yeah, I'm.....Just feeling under the weather"  I struggled to hold back tears welling up in my eyes."Oh, I should go, I don't want to get past sick, you saw how well that worked out during the black plague" She took out her backward watch again and smiled and waved to me as she disappeared and her image faded out.As soon as she left I cried.It was not her fault she triggered the memory, it's still so vivid.The robber, the ambush, three years ago and she doesn't even know.I held her bloodied dying body in my hand, and here she was alive and as sweet as ever.
