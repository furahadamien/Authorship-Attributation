The first vessel of the fleet had made contact with a peninsula in the northern hemisphere sometime yesterday from what reports had informed us of, and they also apparently wanted to return home immediately based off of the regressive atmosphere of the civilizations ruins.Dull architecture, disgusting animals and toxic air was the first impression of the human legacy.It resembled more of a landfill on our planet from what the virtual reality scans revealed as they were uploaded to hologram.Nothing seemed able to maintain their existence for a thousand years under the primitive design of their infrastructure and natural world that they chose to coexist with.It truly amazed me when the temporal plane navigator found the species origin point over 20, 000 before the time stamp of the mass extinction event.Beyond the remarkable health and potency of the native creatures and the debris of the decimated cities that had been overrun with plant life,  there could be found on the walls of older and even more horrid buildings the banners that had represented the leaders who had last governed the land.It didn't look very sound with what they were trying to accomplish, the idea of going to war with your own colleagues just to force their opinions onto the general public.From the last activity of many of the humans before the apocalypse-triggering war, it seemed that many had begun to go insane in an attempt to mock the presets of existence and society with crude and unwittingly crafted humor.That was what the graffiti and last traces of digital data suggested, at least.My father didn't hesitate to ignite most of the worlds buildings in that area with a  plasma-thermite warhead when he had left the place with his crew.Its not like he could have ignored all of the nonsense in order to mine all of the resources on account of there not being any left, which was given away by the remains of riots out in the streets that were still clear.The air was contaminated, being unable to absorb for our own usage of it and the bone marrow from most of the fossils of humans that he found were too brittle and worn to sell.The world was absolutely fucked, and that didn't include the inevitable cataclysm that the planet brought upon itself.Past the stupidity there was a white dwarf which they were now orbiting, so my father's team figured it was best to spare themselves of the disgusting attempt at a star-based empire and let the dying star that they always avoided take out the dead rock that it had become.
