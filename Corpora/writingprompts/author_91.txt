My eyes shot open, but I wasnt welcome to any shiny gates.Hellfire wasnt present either, as I stood in the middle of a movie lobby.Fear chilled my spine as a hand gripped my shoulder.Well if isnt the superhero. A voice that sounded eerily like my own said.I turned my head, and a deer in headlights wouldve been my closest twin.God, youre me? I stammered, as this clone howled the same way I would when something really funny happened.Ah, I love greeting the new guys.Im you, the very first you in fact.Come on, youre missing the movie. He stuffed a platter in my chest with popcorn and a drink on it.My memory became more clear as we moved through the corridor.Stereotypical push child out of the way of a moving vehicle, and I died.Damn anime got me killed.My jaw dropped because there I was on the screen.Somehow, someway I was starring in a movie that I dont remember being in.Then it clicked, hes me in the future.Looks like he lucked out with a bit more height, but other than that he was me.As I made my way into the theater, there was me, scattered about and maybe a couple noticed my presence.Looks like the subject for this one was this flick was his first date.Damn, look at me, shes a fucking 10, I heard from the back of the theater.To no surprise he got a couple chuckles.I thought this kid was smooth, until he flipped his dates plate onto her dark gown.You could see the tears gathering in the  young ladys eyes, as he tried to comfort her.She stormed away from the table, and his face met his hands.What the fuck man, how are you me and cant seal on dates? Looks like I may have quite the womanizer in the past.Cut the kid some slack, remember what happened with Cleopatra? The theater had erupted, as the flick changed to an Egyptian setting.Maybe death wont be so bad after all.
