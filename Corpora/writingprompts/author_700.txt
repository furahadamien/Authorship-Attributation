Lifebringer that was the name that I had once called myself in the old world.People could not catch me, and I had resided myself to my own fate.I recall watching television broadcasts of a mysterious strain of murders taking place in the dead of night.Many involving children under the age of ten.Each of them, one by one, picked off in their own beds as they slept; all stabbed through the heart.The youngest was just over two-years old.People were baffled.I, of course, was not.I remember looking down upon my hand every night and watching the veins on my arm darken and my skin slowly decaying.Every time I had taken a life, more and more of the decay claimed my flesh.I looked down upon my own hand, flexing my fingers, looking upon a strange symbol burned into my skin before I gazed silently at the dagger that always lay just before me on a glass-top table.It had all started just a year before when I was given a vision within a dream; a vision I had simply written off as a nightmare.However, parallels began  I recall the ever detail that lead up to a horrible war that took place within my dream and ever detail was carrying through.When I resolved myself to realization, I had found the dagger upon that very glass-top table and took it within my hand.The dagger spoke to me it told me that it was a tool to bring life to those whose blood it drank at the cost of my soul and self.I could save many, start and new world, at the cost of my very own lifea life doomed to end within a coming war.It was a difficult choice, but I took upon that dagger, accepting its brand that would begin the very decaying of my flesh.I could tell peoplewarn them!Yet, everyone would just consider me insane.And I resolved myself to save as many as I could: usher them, as chosen ones, unto the new world.Change would be mortifying for those involved but well worth the cause; that is also why I chose majority numbers of children.They would grow without much knowledge of the corrupt world wracked with biological warfare that would claim the old.However, I could not just send children.Thats why I started in small farming communities.Those deaths were not as sensationalized upon the news as young children.A missing farmer or two hardly meant a thing to the mass media.I would have loved to cross some scientists, but I knew that it would be difficult to take anyone that may have security as it would lessen my time.I did as much as I could, staying secret butI caught wind that it all may change, and that time was growing shorter for me, so I took off to a small local hospital.Small it may be, it still had things I lacked: medical personnel.And more importantly: more children and those who held knowledge of caring for children in the form of a small maternity wing.Though I knew everything I did was for the good of our civilization to continue, it still pained me to bring the dagger into the chests of the chosen few.My time ended there, that day, within the hospital.The police had come.I am the Lifebringer! I called to them.This would will fall within the week; rains of disease and acid will take you if the mass weapons do not. I recall the words exactly.It was quick and instant.I had been shot within the leg after refusing to drop the dagger, but I did not reside myself from not, at least, seeing the next world before I die.I turned the dagger upon myself and drove it deep into my own heart.The site was that of the weapon splintering into shards of crystal, the fracturing of light caused by the spray of blood and crystal filling my vision as all faded to darkness.I felt hands upon me as roused from my unconsciousness.Look, its another one. The voice was faint to my ears.Thats not just one.Thats the one I told you about. A female voice replied.Its the one that sent us here; said something about the end of the world.

A babys wailing cry was shushed as I trained my eyes open and was greeted by a leaf roof built above a strange structure.The hand that had fallen upon me was of a young man; I didnt recognize him, and I wouldnt as I didnt care to learn the faces of those I would likely never see again.The man removed his hand as I rose my own hand to gaze upon it, the decay still crept up my arm even as I ushered myself upon the new world by my own hand.I used every ounce of my energy to sit up where I lay and look around.A cool breeze blew through the small open-aired building, and I smiled slightly as I gazed upon a vast field of grass before me, a line of trees and a lake within the moderate distance.It was beautiful.Ahso very beautiful.Pain wracked my side and chest and I looked down upon the center of my chest where the decay now ebbing to the center.It was time.Smiling slightly, I allowed myself to fall backwards and lay and mused time and time again of the horror I brought to the world I had just left just for a chance.Are you all right? a very faint voice called to me.I feel tired.I think Ill just sleep.
