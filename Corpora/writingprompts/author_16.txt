On November 23, 1924, wearing a prisoner's uniform and an enviable afro, a new inmate appeared in a cell of Landsberg Prison.As he did, a rush of displaced air made a subtle *sprap* and woke the sleeping someday-dictator."Well, hi there," the new arrival said in German."Who are you?!"said Hitler."I'm Bob Ross.""The fuck is a Bob Ross?"said the future killer of like a bajillion people just for no reason at all."Why are you here?""Adolf, right?I brought a paint set," Ross said, indicating a bag of art supplies."Thought we could see what kind of nice things we can discover together.I bet it's been a while.""How do you know my name?How do you know I paint?""Well, it's a neat little story.Some folks I'd never met popped in on me and asked for my help, and what do you know, they sent me to you," began the curly-headed man."Have you come to release me from here?To unleash the Third Reich?Who sent you?""Oh, just this super bunch I've been enjoying getting to know.Wish you could meet 'em, really.Long story short, they came from the future, taught me German, and sent me along here.I heard you could use a friendly boost to get you painting again.It's awfully important you don't give up on yourself as an artist."He drifted a moment, eyes narrowed and distant.Soon they drifted back to the man who was the origin of the phrase *worse than Hitler.* The latter glowered."Anyway, they said they'd ought to linger back, didn't want to make too much of a splash, they'd tried it.Soooo anyway," he said, unpacking a paint set and easel, "I figure we can just have a good ol' time paintin'.Might even help you get your groove back.Shall we?"He started by drawing his brush through some brilliant blue.Just a nice, bright blue for our sky.Meanwhile, the time travelers' hidden cameras rolled, collecting oodles of juicy footage for a tell-all VR film, "The Essential Joy of Painting," slated for release in 2050.Just a lot of nice footage, just our little secret."Why should I?I've got more important things to do now," barked the host to several malignant thought-tumors, motioning with pen in hand."Humanity must be unshackled from mediocrity and awakened to its destiny!True patriots, proud whites, men who respect the real meaning of *Master Race,* must rise to our full potential--"

"Well, now, let me pause you right there, friend.I've skittered through Mein Kampf and, no sirree, this here brush is the main thing you've got to master."He indicated an extra palette and brush he'd set aside."You think I would trade Utopia for some lost art school fantasy?I will ring in humanity's finest age."Bob shrugged."Wellll, the truth might be a little too grim," he grinned, or grimaced."I figure we just jump right into the good stuff instead here."Sensing a pause, he let his pitch drop from sunny to serious, but he kept his smile."Look.Adolf.This is your fullest potential, right here.The future hangs in the balance.Now, I'll hand it to you -- you got gumption... one way or another, the world will remember you as a powerful leader.You're the one who decides where to lead.Will you take the art world into a new golden age, or the lead the whole world into a nasty war over -- pardon my potty talk -- a buncha grade A malarkey?"Swishing his brush in nice circles, he made happy little clouds appear, just all over.Without another word, he waited for Hitler's reply.The authoritarian fuckhole scratched his shitsmear moustache and frowned as he had since college, or thereabouts.He couldn't place why, but he actually wanted to believe this ethnically ambiguous stranger.He reached for the brush, then hesitated."How do I know I can trust in you?Are you not surely sent by some dusky Jew 
In some tricky business, us whites to subdue?You've done your digging on my fights in the future --

My greatest achievements, and you judge that my weakness 
Must be shame!or Fright?Or these overlong speeches!With paints or with plights you'll distract me, that right?A cheap jewy trick to extinguish my light!You've come to strike me a blow in the nuts 
Before I take over, as we all know I must!Be gone with you, sneaky semitic old fuck!I bet you're a jew and a son of a slut!"Ross took a deep breath and tightened his gut
He summoned his strength and he chewed on his tongue.Each utterance struck, the words really cut,
But in German, it didn't even rhyme once.By the way, as they spoke, Bob's brush had been moving
And mountains took shape, and the lake was improving.The dread fuhrer's words hadn't lingered, it seems.They say peace comes swift to a painter of dreams."I know that it's tough," Said Bob, dipping his brush,
"But one thing you learn from the canvas is trust.Trust me, it's more than a brush you pick up --
It's knowing you, too, can paint beautiful stuff.You're new, but I'll tell you a secret: you're enough.You just have to know where your health comes from.If I didn't paint, well, I'd be -- pardon my tongue --
a patoot, a real jim-dandy son of a gun.But I'm just as pleased as a person can be.See, I paint every day, but enough about me.I'm just a guy too.So let's just have some fun,"
And Bob finished with a flourish.Adolf was stunned.He sat, and he faltered, and took in those words
And noticed Bob's work made his own look like turds.He wanted so badly to lay brush to canvas
But art school admins wouldn't let him on campus."But what if they laugh?"Adolf said just after, 
And suddenly started to cry.His own tears, even to blitzkrieg's crafter, 
Were clearly a surprise.Bob cleared his throat, and almost spoke, 
And then sat down beside."I've been called an amateur painter, myself, 
And believe me.I wanted to die.""It's scary getting back on, old boy,
And starting again to ride.But our legacy can be made of joy, 
And I think it will be this time.It's not your skill that'll make you great, 
Nor is it your pure bloodline.Take your brush through every hue of paint
And here's what you'll find;

Patience and love make you bolder than hate--
The power it wields is too blind.Facing the canvas is your better fate.If you'll let me, I'll show you the good life."Ross shifted in front of the camera and smiled,
And, looking in Hitler's eyes,
Said, "How about learning the Joy of Painting?"And Adolf said simply,

"I'll try."
