The ceiling light faded away, leaving the sun gleaming in its place.I had time to remember a joke about Sherlock Holmes and a tent before sound leaked back into my little world, carried by a single word."Rise."I sat up, the spatula in my hand clanging against the ground.Surprise registered at the noise, but dulled, as though I should have expected it.The voice belonged to an old man, flanked by a pair of ravens.Each bird was the size of a horse, but somehow, the man himself seemed no taller than I, even with them on his shoulders.Pushing myself to standing without dropping the spatula was harder than it would have been otherwise, but my hand refused to open around it.A glint of sunlight reflected into the old man's single eye as I stood, drawing his gaze."That is your weapon?I have seen many weapons of war in my time, but that, whatever it is, cannot be one."I glanced down at it.The red along the serrated side seemed entirely too bright, but I couldn't remember why.One of the ravens hopped down from his shoulder.The first beat of its wings blew my hair back, drawing my eyes back up.By the time it reached me, though, it was no larger than an ordinary bird.It pecked disdainfully at the spatula for a moment, and turned to its master, croaking."No.A tool for cooking meat."It shook its head at me and took off, flapping back to its perch."He is unworthy."The old man glanced to the other raven, who croaked out his own reply."Wait.Let him defend himself."I stared at it.The red still seemed as out of place as I was, before this man and his talking birds.There was something wrong there.Not just the color, but the tool itself.I fought to remember - had I been grilling?It was certainly warm enough here to stand outside, a beautiful summer day with the smell of meat grilling, music playing, the kids laughing and running, a knock at the door-  
"He has no defense.Look at that vapid stare.Send him on his way."The old man nodded, a condemnation that stung, and turned to the other raven."Wait.Let him defend himself."It was the knock.Yes, that was it.We were all out there, in the backyard.The knocking was insistent, loud enough that we heard it over the kids.We hadn't invited anyone over, had we?She went to check, while I flipped the burgers, pressing on each one to test it, seeing the red juice trickle-  
"He was *cooking meat!* Look at his wrist, he's still doing it!He doesn't belong here, Odin.He is no warrior."Odin - *Odin?* - turned to the other raven, who simply repeated his admonition."Wait.Let him defend himself."This time, his gaze caught mine.There was something fierce in that eye, something dangerous, and I found myself lost, trapped in that terrible gaze-  
Movement at the corner of my eye broke my reverie.Another man had arrived to stand before Odin and the ravens.He was on his back, as I had been, but he writhed and twisted, as though grappling with an unseen enemy.He clung uselessly to a gun, twisted up against his stomach.His eyes, all I could see of his face behind the wool mask, stared up at me in horror, and I remembered.Remembered her screaming, the door smashing in, the gun going off.Yelling at the children to run.Throwing open the back door, careening across the house to find her on the floor, him standing over her, gun pointed down.Diving over her, flailing at his face, the gun.Scoring a hit, feeling the serrated teeth bite into him.Feeling the gun go off, heat and pain piercing through me as we fell.Hacking at him as the gun boomed again and again, muffled by my weight.Seeing the red spatter and fly from the edge, sparkling in the sunlight-  
A raven, croaking in unmistakable laughter, distracted me from the spray long enough to look up.Odin sat forward in his chair, his one eye wide in surprise.The hateful bird sat on the ground where it had fallen when Odin moved, its beak open in similar shock.The other bird, still atop its perch, laughed and laughed before speaking."You see?He has defended himself, and his home.Admit him to Valhalla, before that hapless invader dies a third time."I looked down, to where I still knelt on the robber's chest.Blood pooled around him where the spatula's edges had torn open his neck, just as it had on the tile in my entryway.I watched as the light faded from his eyes again, leaving only the reflection of my wife's face, tears streaming, the ceiling light behind her head gleaming like the sun."Rise, berserker.Valhalla awaits."
