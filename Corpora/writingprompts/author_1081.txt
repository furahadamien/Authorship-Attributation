"This..this can't be what I think it is, can it?"Jenkins voice was breathy and a little scared through my comm.There was also a low buzzing noise, probably some kind of static.I looked down at the three bodies and the red and yellow flag on the cave floor."I don't know what else it could be."I responded.The Soviet flag was small, only about a foot across and half a foot high.Payload used to be expensive, back in the bad old days, so I wasn't surprised.The bodies though...They weren't wearing any clothing, but scraps of what looked like old suits clung to their flesh.They were not in good shape.There were massive growths over most of their skin and something else...

"They look like they are all connected to each other.Like there is some kind of, I don't know, umbilical cord connecting each one to the other."Jenkins said."Carmichael, we have to find a way to report this."The buzzing was a little louder now.Our Earth-range radio had stopped working shortly after we had established the small forward base.We couldn't find anything technically wrong with the equipment, but Jenkins had managed to trace some kind of signal coming from this cave.We had come out here to investigate, not knowing what we were going to find.The cave was shallow and we didn't see any technology."Can you sweep for the signal?Try to find where it's coming from?I don't see any machines.And what the hell is that noise?"This buzzing was starting to become irritating.Jenkins held up his small receiver and swung his arm slowly from one rocky wall to the other.Then he hesitated.I could see, even through the tinted facemask, that something was wrong."What?"I asked."Hold on.This...oh shit."He said, bringing the receiver to rest in front of the Russian cosmonauts bodies.I swallowed."It's coming from them, isn't it?"I don't know what Jenkins said in response, because suddenly the buzz became much louder.It was all I could hear.I cut the speaker in my helmet.It didn't matter, I still heard it.Suddenly, Jenkins doubled over, and a long line of the red Martian dust that covered the floor exploded upwards between the nearest cosmonaut and him.His suit split open in a line from his boot to above his knee.A pulsing tendril of flesh, exactly like the ones that connected the Russians to each other, now connected him to them.I tried to back out, but my right foot wouldn't move.Something was connecting it to the ground.Guess what that was.The buzzing ceased to be a drone, and became the language we're using to talk to you now.That's how we came to be where you found us.That's how the ones who come to find you will be.We were expecting more after the first three, but according to Carmichael's memories, they must have lacked the funds to follow up on their first mission.We only need a few more now for critical mass.Then, we will bring Unity to your world, as we brought it to this one.Stop struggling.It will soon cease to hurt.Pain is a burden we will reject together.Until then, we will all be quiet, and wait.
