The world seemed to blur as the hero raced through the landscape, arms furled behind him like the wings of an airplane.It was good to run.Ever since he had gotten framed for robbing that bank a few days ago, his life had been a mess.He was hunted down in the capital city, arrested, and locked up on a remote island.This was the first chance he'd had to really stretch his legs.Unfortunately, his legs didn't seem to be working.Or rather, they were, but he wasn't getting anywhere.All his incredible speed was moving him at merely a walking pace."It's no use.You can't break free."The hero looked up to see himself, wrapped in black."Hey, you're the one who robbed that bank!And put the cops on my tail!Who are you?And why do you look like me?""*I* look like you?I think you're the fake."His doppelganger chuckled."You're not even good enough to-"

"I'll make you eat those words!"Ever impatient, the hero interrupted his counterpart.He summoned all the energy he could and willed his legs to move faster.With excruciating difficulty, he accelerated to a moderate run, still blazing fast for anyone else.He charged straight at the shadow in front of him, preparing to attack, but when he got close, the figure disappeared.The hero ground to a halt and looked around frantically."So there's more to you than just looking like me.You ran fast enough to counteract my power."*It's not his speed... he must be teleporting somehow.*

"I'd like to stay and see what you're capable of, but I don't have time for games.Farewell."*If I can get him to do it again, I can figure out what he's doing.*

New plan in mind, the hero taunted his shadow."I won't let you get away that easily!""You won't even get the chance."Another burst of speed.Another charge.*Come on.Do it.*

The hero's dark reflection filled his vision.*Do it already.I've almost reached you.*

It felt like his doppelganger was inches away when he finally disappeared from the hero's sight.The slowed time worked against him, letting the hero see the words he mouthed before blinking away.*So that's what it is.But... can I really do this?*

He heard his counterpart's voice speak again from behind him."Not bad for an imposter.But not even you will be able to move after *this*."*OK, here it comes.Focus.*

They both knew what to do.Two hands produced two gemstones.Each was tense, ready, waiting for the other to move.After what felt like a second and an eternity all at once, the two hedgehogs shouted the words in unison."Chaos Control!"---

Ow, the edge.Sorry for turning a great prompt into Sonic fan fiction.
