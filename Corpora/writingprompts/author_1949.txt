"W-what?"I stammered to him, staring down at what was left of my wallet, and the smoke from the barrel of his gun."I don't understand.""Someone was tracking you through your wallet in attempts to take you out when no one was watching" the man said, as he reloaded his pistol and picked up the wallet."That screeching you heard was the sound of the bug in there, shorting out."I gulped, terrified by the thought, when suddenly I heard a car slow to a stop at the opposite side of the alley.The man, after he finished smoothing out his dark suit, grabbed me and pulled the both of us behind a dumpster.Strangely he proceeds to put one hand to his ear."Finch," he began, "I didn't get to his wallet in time, they found him."The man squares up behind the dumpster, ready to lean out at whoever came.Still in shock, but at the same time intrigued, I lay flat to see underneath.Three figures had gotten out of the car and began walking down the alley way, each holding what looked like a machine gun.They were talking to each other, but I couldn't make out what they were saying.As they approached closer and closer my mysterious savior remained silent next to me, prepared to fight for his life, and mine.Suddenly shots rang out from an intersecting alleyway near the gunmen, taking two down immediately.The third begin spraying wildly in that direction, sending bullets pinging everywhere, when he was likewise shot down.As he slowly slumped to the ground, a woman dressed equally as dark as the man, walked up and put another bullet in his head.Then she starts towards us."I thought I told you to stay out of this Root," said the man in the suit, "I had them.""Sorryy," she said sarcastically, with a big smile on her face."She told me it was important to be here, so I stepped in."Immediately she stopped in her tracks and stares into space for a moment, before looking at the man, with a very serious face."She said there's more, from both front and behind."This time it was the man's turn to smile."Finally, now I get some action."The woman, who I suppose her name is Root, walked past us behind the dumpster and took cover behind a stack of wooden boxes.I suddenly hear two more cars come to a stop from both ends of the alley, and from one side I see six men step out and proceed down the alley, carrying a variety of weapons.I assumed the same was to be said when Root began firing down the other end of the alley, and shots rang back as well.Hearing the report down the alley, the men on my side started running faster towards us.As they passed the bodies of their friends, the man in the suit leans out and squeezes off three shots, each one hitting the kneecaps of three of the assailants.The three remaining take cover behind alleyway debris, and fire back.Terrified, I could do nothing but hug the wall from behind the dumpster, and watch from underneath.More gunfire sounded from the other end, and I glanced to see Root firing away with her two pistols before taking cover to reload.We were pinned down.As the firefight continued, no progress was made on my side of the alley, and it looked like this might just be the end.Suddenly a different sounding gun rang out through the alley, and two of the 3 remaining men dropped.The third, seeing his fallen brethren, took off down one of the side alleyways, not to be seen again."Thanks Shaw," I heard the man mutter, as he turned to assist the girl Root.Together, with this Shaw firing his or her gun alongside the other two, the remaining assailants were subdued.Once the man walked over to the 3 men kneecapped and cuffed them, he walked back over to me.So does Root
"Your safe, that should be the last of them.Now get home."Finally able to collect myself, I explode."WHAT JUST HAPPENED?WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?"Keeping the same facial expression, the man politely says, "you were in danger, and we saved you.That's all you need to know."Root smiles, and the both of them begin walking away."WAIT," I shouted, stopping them in their tracks."What if they come back?What if they *find me*?How will I find you guys?"The man turns around and lightheartedly smiled."You'll never find us.But if those men come for you again... We'll find *you*."
