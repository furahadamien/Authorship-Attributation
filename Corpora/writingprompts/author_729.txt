Trying to fight the tears back I force the blade penetrating the skin.It sinks straight into the heart.Blood pumps out of the wound with every pump.I can see it now.Everything that is beautiful.It's real.Life after death or maybe just my brain struggling to function.As i gasp for air and take my last few breaths.I let go of the blade.I feel tingling in my head.My vision goes blank.I feel nothing.I thought i was dead.I see it again.The world.What happened.I'm a hero?
