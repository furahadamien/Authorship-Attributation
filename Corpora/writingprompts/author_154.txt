MKUltra was brilliant in idea but was never practically usable.However, humanity was about to find out just how powerful mind control could be when used correctly."They won't even see it coming!"said the Commander of the United Galactic Naval Heavy Squadron.He had recently ordered the deployment of the LiCoFi system, which is said to effectively control a population but taking complete control of a dim light source.One example would be a moon reflecting light from a local star onto a planets nightly surface."Sir, Light Control Field is ready to begin its projection protocol."said an enlistee to the Commander's left."Awesome.Take control."Frederik was a young gentleman who didn't have any friends or close relatives, and he rarely talked to anyone.Consider it self-alienation.Frederik or Fred, as he liked to be called, was surprised to hear his phone ringing on his nightstand.He looked at the message after he gave it the attention it required to shut the fuck up.He paused after he finished reading, took a deep breath, and re-read the emergency alert."DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON" were the only word Fred trusted after the messages started flooding in.As Fred scrambled to preserve his laptop and cell phone in the microwave, he quickly secured the house.Before pulling the battery out of the phone, he glanced at the three messages from his relatives.Its a beautiful night tonight.Look outside. they had said."Yeah, fuuuuuuuck that" Fred mumbled to no one.He decides he wasn't going to be working the next day and took a toke from remnants of a half-smoked joint.He heard the singing as sleep stole him.When Fred woke, the sun had probably been up for a couple of hours already.The singing had stopped and Fred dared to peek outside.No one could be seen from any of his windows.He got dressed and snuck outside, moving as if a cat sneaking around doing naughty things it didn't want its owner to find out about.The only thing he heard at that point in time was the wind.Fred knew that silence was never good, and tactically retreated inside to wait for another day or two.
