I awoke to the quorking of ravens.The fact that I knew that sound meant ravens, or even what quorking was, surprised me, but didn't concern me.Nor did the fact I couldn't quite remember where I was or what I had been doing.That too, should've concerned me but, pleasantly, didn't.It felt like I was waking from a long nap, a bit foggy but refreshed.The ravens flapped and hopped around their perch in a way that seemed to indicate confusion or argument and, for a time, I just watched them.It was some time before I realized there was someone else in the room, or space, or where ever this was.A hooded old man, also observing the ravens with something approaching paternal concern was turned away from me.I tried to clear my throat politely but the sound echoed impossibly and all three figures turned to regard me."Greetings traveler," the old man said, "You've caused my little friends here a bit of confusion.It seems your tale is a bit unusual for my halls, so I've chosen to hear it directly.Tell me sir, are you a warrior of your people?"It didn't feel like an interrogation and somehow I wasn't scared.It was like my grandfather had asked me about what I had for breakfast that day.It felt right to reply, and suddenly memory became clear."Uh...sir, no...not a warrior.Actually, farthest thing from it by most peoples way of thinking - I'm just a cook."I felt this would somehow end the dream, or whatever this was, or the man would be unimpressed, but he wasn't.If anything, he seemed to be smiling."That explains this," a dented, scratched spatula appeared in the mans hand.Memory seemed to awake at the sight."Yes!That's mine!I mean, well, the one I always use.I guess it's my favorite, as much as a spatula can be.I was using it just a little while ago, making....what was I making?I'm sorry, I can't remember."I felt the need to apologize to this figure, although I wouldn't be able to tell you why.He seemed familiar, somehow, like a relative I hadn't seen in years."Don't bother yourself with worry, traveler.Why don't you take up your favorite...spatula, and tell me of your...labors with it."The old man offered the spatula to me, handle first, carefully, almost tenderly, like it was precious and fragile.I reached out a hand to touch it and felt a flash of memory."I...I was in the...cafeteria...Yes, that's where I was.I work for the district and was making lunch.Chicken tenders and tater-tots, green beans, apple sauce, even a little salad.It's good for the kids to have good food to eat, don't you think?I always loved working with the kids and the district was kind enough to give me a job, even though I had a record."It felt natural to say this to the old man.He was feeling more like a long missed friend so sharing with him was comfortable...easy."A cook, for children?That was your task?Your role amongst your people?"The question wasn't delivered with malice or derision, the old man wasn't mocking me or being cruel.If anything, he seemed..surprised, maybe even a little impressed."Yes, I love working with the children.Little Cheryl and Tommy and Franz were always nice to me, always tried to tell me jokes.I made sure to give them extra tater-tots - they love tater-tots.They even made me some macaroni art!I hung it up behind the counter so I could see it every day."The children.Something about the children.Something horrifying was crawling at the edge of my memories.The children were in danger!The old man must've seen panic on my face."Peace, traveler, the children are safe," The old man put a hand on my arm and I instantly felt a peaceful calm return, "tell me of this day, friend, then we can go from this place.""Today?Normal day I guess.Spilled tea on myself getting ready, had to change my shirt and almost clocked in late.I was just getting ready for lunch when I started hearing something from upstairs.I didn't think the kids were doing a field day and the banging was so loud.I went to look out and kids were already running down the stairs, screaming and crying..." I could feel tears of my own forming at the memory..."I saw Tommy and Franz holding Cheryl...trying to push their hands against her side, already slick with blood.Tommy was missing a chunk of his right ear but didn't seem to care, he was holding onto Cheryl as hard as a 7 year old could.He was so brave, even as the other kids ran in every direction."The memory was an avalanche now.The screams of panicked adults and terrified children.The smell of blood and gun powder.The thunder of the shots getting closer.I remembered."I...I took them into the freezer, in the back of the cafeteria.Tommy, Franz, Cheryl....all the kids I could find.I found the big first aid kit we always keep in the cafeteria and yanked it off the wall to throw into the freezer with them and told them not to open the door, no matter what.Then I broke the handle and I think..." my memory ended with the shock of impact, of a force on my back and a sudden red stain on the freezer door.Understanding slowly unfolded in my mind.The old man stood silent for a long time.The ravens had taken to his shoulders at some point and all were looking at me intently.It was only now that I realized the old man, face hidden in shadow, seemed to have a patch over one eye.He also had a tear running down his face."I see now why my little friends were confused, traveler.Midgard has changed greatly since I last walked there and with it, so has the shape of battle.Thankfully, what hasn't changed is the stout heart of man."The old man seemed to be drawing himself up, getting impossibly big and powerful looking.In the distance, horns blared."Listen, friend, the horns of my hall are sounded for you.You have a place among the honored dead here.You fell upon a field that should never have been a battleground, defending those who should never need be warriors.You showed the bravery of long ages past and when you did, you held this in your hand."The final memory blossomed in my mind.I had used the spatula to break the handle, that's why it was dented and scratched.Something new blossomed there.I could see minutes later, help arriving, the freezer being forced open, medics attending the survivors.Even little Cheryl.I saw a memorial in the cafeteria, candles and flowers.I saw drawings of crayon and sparkles, thank yous and prayers, Cheryl walking slowly, still bandaged, crying, laying another piece of macaroni art on the pile.In the middle, on a small stand, was the spatula.My spatula.I turned to the old man, who I now knew as if he was my father.He indicated a direction and we began walking together towards his distant hall as his ravens took flight, quorking to themselves contentedly.Edit 1:  I am stunned and humbled by the response this has elicited, especially from folks who work with or at schools themselves.Thank you all.I will try to respond to all the comments I can individually, and will thank all the folks who were generous enough to gild this directly as soon as I can.I'm also integrating the very helpful feedback from a few folks who noticed I drifted into the 3rd person a few times.Edit 2:  A few people have asked if I had a subreddit, so I've decided to condense all the prompts I've responded to over here - https://www.reddit.com/r/SpecialistSix/.I hope a few that didn't get much traction the first time around get some new readers.Edit 3:  Check out /u/NachosGalore  - I think it's great!
