My typical bedtime is around 1, sometimes 2 AM.Such a night owl.I get it from my dad, although I'm still unsure whether it's mostly his genes or behavior to blame.For sure, a combination of the two.When I'm feeling 'extra insomniac', I'll go night swimming in the lake outside my house, which usually wears me out enough to snooze til 10 or 11 the following morning.Well, tonight (thanks, Dad!), It's just before 3 AM and I find myself browsing Reddit.The bright screen of my smartphone does me no favors either.Before calling it 'a night', I browseand stumble across something about phone alerts and a beautiful night sky (but I'm not supposed to look at it).Intrigued, perplexed, and mystified--I like it, but not enough to write my OWN prompt.Sure, I'll read a few.Most are good.A couple that are rubbish.And then, a few really creative ones.And then I sleep.The thing about sleep, is that you can't ever put your finger on the EXACT moment at which you fall asleep.It's like you've sinking in a pit of quicksand, and before you suffocate, you wonder, "well how far did I actually sink?And what if I had wore boots (or heels, for the ladies) today?"Anyway, that's what sleep is like to me.This slow death that we evade, but can't ever seem to avoid.It's gonna happen.On the other hand, we tend to remember EXACTLY how our day started.Almost like, our consciousness is this ink pen that writes so distinctly, so vividly at first, but drys up as the day goes by.Well, at precisely 3:01 AM, I'm thrust into a most awakened state, by the most spine-chilling sound you can imagine.Think, fire alarm mixed with smoke detector, only it's coming from my damned phone.A strange, bewildering noise, and one that immediately prompts me to grab the contraption to see what the HELL is going on, then TURN THE DAMNED THING OFF![i]DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON[/i]

With the alarm still blaring in my ears, I'm absolutely irate with the trivialness of the system message (the moon?who cares!), but I also find myself curious to its as to its, as dozens of notifications begin to roll in across different apps (from seemingly random people).[i]it's a beautiful night tonight...look outside[/i]

I shake my head and grit my teeth and vow to disable notifications for these stupid Apps, just as soon as I can shut off the volume.God, is it just me or is it getting LOUDER?!The notifications continue pouring in, by the hundreds now.In fact, they're coming in faster than I can close them, and complicating matters worse, now my phone screen stops responding to the touch of my finger.Wasting no more time with the damned thing, my thumb forcefully crushes the side power button, anticipating that in 5 seconds, this infernal noise emulating from the phone, will be all but forgotten.And yet...15 seconds have now gone by, and still my phone won't turn off.Just a heinous amount of notifications flooding my screen.[i]it's a beautiful night tonight...look outside[/i]

The existence of star and moon emojis in the messages remind me of the cryptic alert that first woke me up, and it strikes me as ironic that I should concern myself with a lunar body that's 238,900 miles from me/Earth, when my phone is just inches from my eardrums, and blaring at dangerously loud levels.If my ears weren't in so much pain, I'd probably have noticed how much my thumb was quivering from pushing that power button with so much intensity.But for the love of God, how long have I been pushing this button for now, 60 seconds?I can't THINK with this RACKET!What must be done?!The nuclear option would be to break the phone, but I paid A LOT for this piece of shit (it's getting LOUDER) and I didn't get the "Accidental Warranty Plan".Not even my pillows seem to reduce the volume of the alarm.And the maddening notifications just keep rolling in.[i]it's a beautiful night tonight...look outside[/i]

Fed up, I leave the room impulsively, cellphone still on my bed (screaming at me), and make my way to the front door of the house.I know where I'm going.My tranquil place.The lake.The clamor from my phone is slightly less deafening now that there's a few rooms of drywall and cinderblock to damper the soundwaves, which provides me with just enough clarity of mind to remember the warning.[i]DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON[/i]

Cracking open the door, I feel a slight breeze in the night, but nothing else pulls away my attention...with the exception of the murderous alarm of my phone, which I'm eager to abandon, as I make my to the lake.Fortunately, I don't need the flashlight from my phone, since the full moon of the night sky illuminates my path.I'm tempted to look up but still, walking out the door I remember the warning.[i]DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON[/i]

I have a decent amount of self control for certain things (others, not so much), but suffice it to say, I have no desire to look up at the moon.I've seen them all--blood moons, crescent moons, half moons...hell, I can imagine just what this one looks like tonight, as I run toward the lake (raising my body temperature should make a night dive feel all the better).After a two minute jog, I find that I'm actually far enough away now to only barely hear the phone alarm.Despite the relief to my ears, my body is in quite a vexed state, and the whole preponderance of the notifications has me so distracted, that I hardly notice the lake, until my bare feet sink deep into the wet body of water, my eyes coming into contact with a bright, beautiful reflection of that celestial body.As soon as I see it, my brain remembers the warning.[i]DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON[/i]

But it's too late.How could I have been so foolish?My limbs freeze with fear, my eyes locked onto the image of the full moon being reflected by the lake's surface.As my body keels over and collides with the water, I feel like I've been here before.And like a slowing clock hand, my mind approaches a final, singular question.Before I drowned, how deep did I sink?
