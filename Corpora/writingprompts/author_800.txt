"You get a whole month??Who is celebrating this?Who is PROUD of PRIDE?You be proud OF other things!Stupid."Pride pursed his lips.He adjusted his bow-tie, smoothing it."I, ah, think you've misunderstood.""You'll misunderstand my fist in a minute..." Wrath said, fidgeting with an armour-spike.He screwed his firey eyes up, looking into the distance."There's only 12 months total, there'll be more time about us than NOT at this rate.And what about the Virtues?""Psh, fuck the Virtues," piped up Greed, waving a hand."No one can even name them.""Ah--"  
"I still don't get why Pride is the first month.Gluttony, UUURP, seems like the obvious one.Who doesn't like a good eat-up?""If you'll just let me--"

Wrath struck his fist against the table."I'M the one who needs it!!Do you know that wars are on the decrease?They're an endangered species!""What about a month where every one agrees to sleep i--"  
"Shut up, Sloth," everyone said.It sounded like Peter Griffin's, "Shut up, Meg.""I want two months," said Greed but everyone knew he was just trying to be clever.Everyone fell silent, brooding.FInally, Pride spoke up."It's, ah, well, it pains to have to admit this...But Pride month is not, ah, actually about yours truly."Everyone looked at him.Lust's painted nails tapped over her phone.She read, then laughed.Then laughed and laughed."Of COURSE it is!""What?What?""Lol, those sluts.""Whaaat?"Lust waved them off.She pointed to Pride, holding in laughter, waiting for him to explain.Pride turned pink."Oh, I don't...Does it matter?Let's get back on topic, who has our dark lord Lucifer's meeting apology email?"A metal hand slammed onto the padding on Pride's suit shoulders.Pride looked into Wrath's firey eyes."Right.Um.Well.It's, ah, it's, ah... Well, it's gay people."Silence."Queer people, I should say.LGBTQIA+ etc, as they say.They're, ah, proud to be them."More silence.Pride waved a tiny, imaginary flag."We're here...we're queer."Wrath smashed the table again."WELL WHERE IS GAY WAR DAY??"
