This is not quite what the prompt says, but it has the detail of being true, except for the phrase.I noticed them bit by bit.One here, one there, a small black and yellow horror flying around my truck.I began to really wonder and connect things when I noticed several of them while parked in the middle of a vacant lot.I'm a trucker, and pretty much live in my rig.And what the hell are these damn things doing way out here?Where are they coming from?After slowly getting to the point where I really noticed them I realized the awful truth: they're living in the visor of my rolling house.That was three years ago.Once I decided to live and let live instead of getting some industrial bug spray, I started greeting them.When one would fly inside the truck I would shepherd it out gently with the words "Today you, tomorrow me, right guy?"Now often when I park there's 2, 3,4...sometimes even 5 flying around my windows and mirrors...checking out the smashed bug guts buffet perhaps.Or maybe just coming to say hello.Part of me wonders if enough generations of them have grown up with my smell...or there's some magic fairytale bug hoodoo...that they are never aggressive.I've never been stung.Not once.I wonder about their queen.Is she nice?That's stupid, right?Bugs aren't nice...or not nice...they just are.When I noticed that I can now sit with my windows down and not get eaten by mosquitoes...well, that's when I truly saw the value of having my own little swarm of flying predators.Not that I try to handle them although to be honest I've thought about it.Maybe I could hand feed them...So today I was checking under the hood for leaks and four of my swarm were checking out the front grill.Another driver starts to walk by, stops and practically backpedals and stands 20 feet away as I say "ok guys I really have to close the hood now".I close the hood with them flying around me, turn and tell the guy not to worry, they're mostly harmless.He sits in his truck in the dock next to me with his windows up, giving me this...look...while I'm in my truck with the windows down with my guys flying in and out my window.Look, I'm not crazy.It's NOT like I named them or anything.I honestly can't tell them apart.A few interesting tidbits...I had the visor light on that side burn out.So i climb up onto the top of the engine with my tools thinking in either going to get stung or have a bad fall.As I get up there I say "Hey, it's just me, sorry to bother you I'm just changing the light".I take the light off..the one I've seen them go up behind...and NOTHING.No nest.No activity.The visor is hollow, I've changed all the lights..that should provoke them...nothing.When I put my truck in the shop they are nowhere to be seen.Same thing when I get the truck washed, and the power sprayer is focused in front of and behind the visor.When I'm stopped and they're flying around I notice that when I start to move they all get back on board.It makes me smile every time.Come on guys, bus is leaving.So, what do y'all think?Is it that my scent is familiar or magic bug hoodoo?
