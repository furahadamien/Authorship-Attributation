Maybe I'm mad, maybe I'm not.But this motherfucker standing in front of me is my father, who disappeared ten years ago with some silly excuse of buying a pack of cigarettes, never to return.In his absence, my mother had to struggle to make ends meet, while battling cancer and living with guilt, blaming herself  for his abrupt disappearance.Silence.Deadly silence.We stare at each other for what could have been an hour.Our mouths seemed to have lost the ability to formulate speech.In his eyes I could see a look of bewilderment.In my eyes I hope he could see the look of disgust, anger, hate,all boiling in a pot filled with rage."Charles?"His voice hasn't changed at all."Fffffffffaa..." was all I could muster."Son.""Father," I whispered."Why did you abandoned us?"The volume of my voice sharply increased."I did not."He said, while staggering towards a chair.He sat down and put his head in hands."Something's wrong."He said."Very."I replied through gritted teeth."Where's your mother?""She died."I replied with malice."Two years ago on this exact date"."Its been two years?""Ten.To be exact.Ten years since you left us.""No no no no no."He kept shaking his head in his hands.He stood up, looking like a ragged doll and shell-shocked."I've been gone an hour at most," He said.At this moment a knock could be heard on the front door.I approached it , happy to be rid of my dad's psychotic presence, and opened the door.Two men wearing identical black suits, and black sunglasses where standing on the front porch."Is this the home of the Luck family?"The first man asked."Is there a problem?"I replied."Is Mr. Edward Luck your father?""Who's asking?"The men looked at each other and smirked."We're asking."The second man barked."Is he at home?"I sniggered."This isn't his home anymore.""Is he around?"The first man queried."No.He.Isn't."I said firmly."Kid."The second man uttered."You don't wanna fuck with us.""Now step aside" the first man ordered, reaching in his pocket.
