A serious looking man in a suit enters a U.N.Briefing room, the room is crowded its filled with various scientists, military commanders, world leaders and senior Hollywood execs.The serious looking man starts talking... 

Its been official confirmed his missing again! 

A low murmur of consternation ripples around the room, cries of how when and not again can be heard.Quiet!This is what we know, 24hrs ago an unidentified craft entered earth atmosphere, proceeded to evade all aircraft and fly directly to Los Angeles and appear to have landed at the Damon Residence and taken all members of the household

Surveillance footage shows a small team of alien figures moving around the house, at this stage we have no clear idea of their arms or capability 

The question ladies and gentleman, is what can we learn and how can we get him back? 

The room quickly fills with noise as conversations erupt, ideas and speculations shoot around as various parties.The room Hushed as a quiet nondescript little man sitting in the back clears his throat loudly.He begins speaking softly in a american accent

I think my agency might be able to help, with be building a new prototype space craft, its been developed in secret and utilizes technology retrieved from Roswell.We believe it can be ready to launch in 48hrs and we can a small team of our best special forces on board 

From the back an Australian voice speaks up shouldnt we send the best special forces team, our S.A.S, trounced your teams in the last notional games 

A loud ripple of agreement echoes the sentiment.The stern man brings the briefing to a close its agreed then, lets make this happen.The next 48 hours become a mad rush, the ship is prepared, scientist and engineers around the world work tireless to retrofit the prototype with space capable armaments.The Australian S.A.S.best squad goes through a rapid shakedown and training session for a mission they could never have imagined.Billions of dollars are spent as agencies around the world, point radios and telescopes to the sky hunting for any sort of trail to lead them to the enemy.NASA workers identify and track an energy signal exiting the solar system.Finally the ship is ready, as it prepares for launch the world watches as the ship is ceremoniously rechristened the Good Hunting.The ship launches, its powerful prototype engines boost it rapidly out of orbit and in pursuit of the alien vessel.Days passes as the ship races to its destination.But eventually they close the gap first picking it up on sensors and then slowly day by day closing on its lead.Slowly they draw down to radio signal range and begin bombarding the alien ship with every signal imaginable in a desperate attempt to communicate.With no response the crew are faced with no choice but to open fire.The new prototype missiles flare out from the ship blow away a wing of the alien vessel.More days pass as the crippled vessels loses momentum, the Good Hunting draws closer preparing for earths first interstellar boarding action.The SAS squad burst through an improvised airlock and steps on to the alien vessel.Guns pointed they race through the ship, only to find bare corridors and rooms full of bizarre alien machinery.Eventually they enter the cockpit there is no live here, a large display shows an alien language and what appear to be a galactic map, a course has already been plotted.A series a human sized caskets line the walls, the glass fronts show them to be occupied, the SAS troopers search the frantically and locate the one Containing Matt Damon, the ones surrounding it hold his family.As the soldier search for release mechanism they fail to notice the alien display change, the galactic map shrinks on the display and a larger message appears, every second the alien language changes... too late a soldier notice the display as what could only have been a countdown reaches zero and the alien vessel jumps to hyperspace....

Across the galaxy a young alien watch officer notices a new blimp come onto his screen.Commander, I think its here... the rescue ship has returned

A fantastic young one, this will be a glorious day for our race.We have spent so long looking for him, after he went missing in that backwater system, the race has spared no expense in the search 

Sir, Im picking up the visual feed from the ship, theres aliens in there sir, dead aliens and the ship appears to be damaged 

What!That backwater wasnt suppose to have intelligent life, I wonder what could have made them go to such lengths to attack our vessel.I mean I know that  Matlark Damon is one over our most beloved celebrities, but he surely he would have followed protocol for alien civilizations, to blend in and hide amongst them.Sir! the Young officer cried you need to see this 
The officer moved to the screen a new blimp had appeared, then another and another... quickly the screen filled as dozens of ships exited warp space.Launch all fighters 

Shit!He thought to himself, this is going to get messy...
