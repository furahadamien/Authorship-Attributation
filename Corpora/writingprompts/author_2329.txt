Where even...?

Somebody mustve killed me.I cant even feel myself.Carrie mustve crashed my car.Had enough of her crap.Some friend.Wish I could come at her right now.I walked towards this door.Am I in hell or something?Cute girly trash... must be hell...or fire...I then see this little kid, must be six.She was in this Victorian-style pink dress, sipping tea.Ive been waiting. She smacked her cup on the table.I scoffed at her.To do what?I don't even know you, you pink brat.

The kid went as pink as her dress.Im Tara. She said with a harsh tone.Who are ***you***? Why would she ask me?She was waiting!Sam. I tossed my ebony black hair.She rolled her eyes as if I said something like people die when they are killed.She then tossed me these crumpets.Sit down or Ill go tea and crumpets on you. She pulled out these pink knives.I immediately sat down.Can't believe that Im scared of some bratty posh girl.She was feeding her stuffed animals, who moved in an unnerving manner.***Moving*** stuffed animals.***Moving***.So now my phone is missing.Great.Not surprised, since Im dead.I cursed to myself.Id tell you to chill out but ghosts dont have body temperatures. She glared at me after looking at the ground.You got all of the crumbs and tea on the floor!The party is ruined!Hmph! She stormed off, folding her arms.Dude, Im dead.I couldn't digest anything even if I wanted to. She then threw some ball at me, me snickering in the process.Thatd go through me you know. She then faced me, looking like she was gonna burst into tears, just like a condom.Hey, maybe I should comfort the sucker.After all, it ain't fun to see a kid get upset.I stood by her side, kneeling down.Hey...

She went all stiff in complete silence.Hmph. I put on a fake smile.Look, Ill try to levitate the crumbs off the ground.

A-And the tea... She wiped her tears.We walked over to the small table.Just as we did that, she made a snide remark about my clothes.You look like something straight outta Hot Topic. She had this smug grin on her face that I could just slap.I chased her down, the Victorian heckler giggling in the process.Yep, definitely hell.
