*Because fuck ya'll and your depressing stories.Let's make this a little more happy, eh?Or at least as happy as possible following the prompt.*

I never knew master's wife.Father said that she was kind and generous and fed him scraps from the table when master wasn't looking.Master did the same, too, of course.That's what humans did.Master was a god, father told me when I was younger.He cared for us, he protected us, he taught us and he played with us.In return we offered our service, paltry as it was.Always faithful to our master.How could we not be?Those were long years ago, now.Father had since passed, and I had children of my own.The master's children kept them, they visited often in their grand chariots.It was good days when they came to visit.I was old now.My time would be up soon, I knew it.I didn't mind.I had fathered many children, gone on many walks, sniffed many butts.I would rest soon.Which was good, because I was tired.Sometimes I forgot I was tired, usually when I was with master, and I would play like I was a puppy again.Then I would be very tired.I thought about my life as I lay on my back, comfortable.I heard the door open, the familiar footsteps of master.I waited for a moment."Dag nabbit Tex I told you don't get on the couch!"He muttered, tossing his hat onto the rack."Well, if you're not getting off at least make some room."Father said that humans lived eons, that master had been his master, and his father's before him, and his father's before him, more generations than father could remember.I was glad, master was a good master, he was kind.He sat beside me, I put my head on his lap and looked up at him.In return he scratched me behind my ears.I felt my eyes close.Certainly master was magic, nothing else felt like that.Ohh....

"Come on, Tex.We've gotta go to the store.Wanna ride in the car?"I scrambled to my feet, barking.Yes!A ride in the chariot!What a treat.Master secured my leash to my collar, struggling with it a little.We got in the chariot and it made a noise like a lion's roar.I barked in response, I would teach it to threaten master.Stupid Chariot.As master drove he kept one hand on the back of my head.He was nice, I panted happily, letting the world pass me by, until he stopped scratching me.I was puzzled.Master lifted his hand to his chest, the other on the reigns of the chariot.Something was wrong.Something was very wrong.Master winced in pain, I barked an alarm.I looked for something, anything to help, but the car was moving too fast and we weren't even on the road anymore, there was a tree ahead and it was big and heavy and I was scared and I kept barking.Then it was over.How had we gotten here?It was nice, a green field, trees, balls and ropes and rawhide bones and the couch was here too!Wow, what was this place?It's awesome!There were other dogs, too.Dogs I knew.Friends!I ran over, barking my excitement.It was father!But he was so young!Barely more than a pup.Mother too!And grandfather, who I had smelled once before I opened my eyes.I was so happy, my tail wagged and wagged, and I barked and barked.There was a sudden stillness.I looked.Master was here, but it wasn't master.He was young, as young as his children, but he was the same master I knew.He smiled at me, and at all of us, and we ran to him, bowled him over in our eagerness and he just laughed and laughed, hugging us to him."Tex!Ralph!Wolfie, Scott, Amy!Oh, it's good to see you all again!"He shouted, we barked back.Master stood, brushing himself off.His eyes were far away, I followed his gaze.It was a woman.Father ran to her, I followed, and master came too.She spoke, a kind voice, "we've been waiting."He laughed and she laughed and I barked and I ran and played with master and his wife and father.We played all day, and for days and days and days, like I did when I was a puppy.But now I wasn't tired, and nothing hurt, and master was happy.I don't know how we got to this wonderful place, but I knew where I was.Home.
