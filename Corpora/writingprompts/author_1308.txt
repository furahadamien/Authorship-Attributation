It's 10 years since the fateful day that Eric met Amelia at the bus stop and professed his oath to always be there for her.Ten miserable years.Eric is at home playing X-Box and within the blink of an eye he is transported to the shoulder of a busy highway, standing next to Amelia.Eric was confused, a deer in the headlights, but he had no ill feelings towards Amelia and helped change out her tire.Eric was completing his homework only to be whisked away as if by magic to stand next to Amelia grasping her twisted ankle in the park.It didn't matter what Eric was in the middle of, he always transported to Amelia when she was in need.Any good faith Eric felt towards Amelia quickly turned into disdain as Eric realized that Amelia was a curse.High school finished and Eric was ecstatic to learn that Amelia was going off to the East Coast.He had a job lined up with his father and he could be rid of Amelia once and for all - freedom; he could drive a car without being transported away; he could go on dates without disappearing.It was with significant shock and hatred when he opened his eyes to find himself outside of Amelia's New York apartment watching Amelia dig through her purse.The curse was still there.It's been 10 years of the Amelia curse; 10 years of misery.Kansas City, New York, San Francisco.He hated Amelia for what his life had become, and he knew that Amelia hated him - she had even filed a restraining order.Eric is drinking alone, as he often does, and opens his eyes to find himself trapped next to Amelia in a burning wreck.They died together.
