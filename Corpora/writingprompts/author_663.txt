They didn't start calling it the "disease" of aging until the 2040's.People were kind at first.Since growing old was the oddity, we had amassed a sort of fame with the youth.They put us on their talk shows and held charities to fund our care.Some of the "Lost Generation" were able to make a living solely off of publicity.And then they got bored of us.At first it was just apathy.They had their own eternal lives to deal with, but with every new generation we found more resistance."Just because they're old doesn't mean they can't work.", became a common talking point on major media outlets.Baby\-faced news anchors arguing that they shouldn't have to pay for our retirement because they would never see one themselves.Then we were shunned.Employment was hard to come by when there was always a buff 60 year old in a twenty something's body waiting in the wing.Ghettos started to form filled with the elderly and the sick.Thankfully some kind activists took care of us paying for housing and food.Unfortunately, even they weren't able to overcome disease.You see, the trials were first given to people ages 20\-26 for some brain elasticity explanation that honestly never made much sense to me.They called it a miracle drug."It stops aging dead in it's tracks!", they claimed.It even reversed aging a bit after extended use.People started regrowing hair and many expressed gradual increase in height!Recently they began to give the drug to younger and younger patients, the youngest being 2 years of age about ten years ago.Only then did we understand their fate to come.What we didn't know, having no way to test long term effects, was that the growth never stopped.We were able to see this manifest much quicker in the very young.As the children grew they began to outgrow their own organs.Their legs broke under their own weight.They were hospitalized, many dying of asphyxiation, unable to get enough oxygen to their brains.Some losing their faculties, their mental state decaying in front of America's eyes.It was a horrifying example of the world's eventual fate.As the medicated youth came to the realization, confronting the news of their returned mortality, mass suicides became the norm.The government couldn't do anything to stop a third of the population from succumbing to their violent emotions.Those who chose stick it out began dying just as we began to pass ourselves.I held my brothers hand as he faded in and out of consciousness those last few days.He groaned in between weak breaths as his long malnourished legs hung off his hospital bed.It seems death was inevitable all along.We were just blessed enough to be prepared for it.
