"For so long, we've thought of death as an event, a process, but what is death really?And why is someone at an Ecology conference waxing philosophic about death during their talk?"The shuffling of conference attendees flipping through their schedules was briefly interrupted by a few chuckles."I'm not here to talk to you about death as you think of it--I hope by the end of this talk, I can convince you that humans have a larger role to play in the food web than a chaotic top predator.In fact, we are nowhere near the top."The shuffling faded as she spoke, replaced by silence and rapt attention."Our body works on electrical impulses.Normally you would assume that, upon death, you would see a smattering of electrical activity that slowly fizzles out.But you don't, instead we see an abrupt disappearance of activity!Where does all that energy go?I've worked with physicists to visualize this process, and we found that the energy jumps from atom to atom, appearing to move into the Earth."Audience members squirmed in their seats.She thought she heard a comment in the back "well at least this nut is better than the guy who read his entire talk from a sheet of paper".She cleared her throat and switched from her title slide to a video showing the phenomenon."As you can see, the electrical charge travels to the left of the body's head in a dendritic pattern until it narrows to a single pathway into the Earth."Gasps came from the darkened room as she replayed the video for effect."Based on our observations of this pattern, we believe there are beings approximately 1 mile into
the Earth that funnel this energy.In fact, we see several of the electrical lines, if you will, leading to clusters of energy found underground.Furthermore, these clusters of energy will abruptly start funneling deeper into the Earth through new networks ultimately reaching larger clusters of energy.We have reason to believe that there is an entire ecosystem belowground, with a top predator in the core."At this, some of the audience clucked their tongues and stood to leave.Others hushed them, trying to listen over the noise of those exiting.She paused until the room was once again quiet."We've called this superorganism Death, and we believe it is responsible for keeping our planet warm."*Edited for spacing.My first post, so I didn't expect it to look so squished!Thanks for reading
