*first story on wp, eeeeee i'm noivous thank you for the awesome prompt and for letting me share!*  
Anyways.Its alright, really.Bouncing is not a bad job most nights.People mostly get funny when theyre drunk.And for the most part, in this small town, everyones pretty good to me.Every now and then there are machismo shitheads who start going off about disrespect.  But thats everywhere.I get free drinks, I get 6% of the tips, my boss spots me money when Im short.Most of the night, Im sitting outside in the cool night air, smoking rollies under the neon lights and just shooting the shit with folks.Its okay.Ive worked here for years.I started at Metronome when I was 28.I dont know, it just made sense.Ever since I was a kid, whenever I looked at someone, really looked into their eyes, I could see their age pop up above their head.Just briefly.Just a little soap bubble number that would dissipate just as quickly as it had come.Im not sure where it came from.I dont mention it.Maybe its hereditary and my dad can do it too, maybe my brother can.They never brought it up.So I never brought it up.But it makes me a fucking great bouncer.Theres all kinds of kids that try to come into the bar.The nervous ones who I really dont even need to know their age to know theyre lying  all shifty and fidgety and avoiding eye contact.Red faced and sweating.They look like they want to cry when I tell them that I know their ID is fake.There are the bros who are all chest and white teeth, who try to walk right past me and get pissed when I stop them.They say fuck this place, bro to their bro buddies when I tell them that I know their ID is fake.They call me a faggot and then try again in a couple of weeks.The kids who crack up and dont even try to make excuses when I tell them that I know their ID is fake.The girls that are already hammered and try to show me their tits when I tell them that I know their ID is fake.Its all little 17s and 20s and 18s that glimmer for a moment over disappointed faces.Anyways.Theres a college about 20 minutes down the road from here.Its to be expected.Mostly on the weekends.On the weekdays, its mostly the same sad family of late 50 somethings who are all definitely depressed and all definitely alcoholics and the crowd of late 20 somethings who are all definitely not depressed and all definitely not alcoholics.Mondays are half off well-whiskey.Thursdays are 2 dollar shot nights.Last night was Tuesday.It was slow all night.I had only two rolling papers left.The door leading into Metronome was closed because theres a jukebox in the corner that people can buy credits on their phone for, and three girls had control over it and no fucking way.It was 56 degrees.Four more people came to Metronome before midnight.Two regulars, Richard (56  do not ask him about politics Jesus Christ), and Michelle (34, ruins the punch line of jokes, loudly exclaims woo when drunk) and two guys (26, 29) I did not know, who appeared to be on a bashful, but sweet blind date.One of the guys (26) came out to smoke for a couple of minutes and asked if I thought his date was out of his league physically.I said I didnt really get a good look, but that shouldnt matter too much if he liked him.Rallied, he finished his cigarette and the two guys left together shortly after.Anyways.Around midnight, a skinny, scruffy guy with messy brown hair and a threadbare sweater approached, digging around in his pocket for his wallet.He couldnt get his ID out for a moment, and said sorry man, before handing it to me.Opie Daniels, 36, brown eyes, 150 pounds.I looked in his eyes and glanced to the number above his head.3845.It took me a long moment to realize what Id seen.I handed Opie Daniels back his ID, told him thank you and thought about rolling one of my remaining cigarettes.And then for a moment I couldnt breathe.I felt a tight clenching in my stomach and for whatever reason, a cool feeling of dread steeping deeply in the pit of my lungs.38.I had seen the number 38.It was all good.But was it?My head was buzzing and I couldnt seem to roll my tobacco up and shaking my head couldnt seem to clear the weird, growing pressure in my ears.I pushed open Metronomes door, crossing the floor, letting myself behind the bar.My hands blindly groped for a beer bottle, as I looked over the bar and as I cranked off the metal top, I found Opie Daniels, sitting alone hunched over a can of PBR, sort of watching the wrestling that was on TV, sort of playing on his phone.He took a slow, intentional drink and his dark, deep-set eyes swung round to meet mine.3845.He met my gaze steadily, evenly, neutrally.There was no defiance in his eyes.No aim to fight.No deep wisdom.He looked normal.I didnt know what to do.I took my beer and I went back outside.It crossed my mind faintly that I was broken.That I was losing the one ability that had so pervasively helped me as a bouncer.If that was true, I was fucked.I was shit at telling fake IDs from real IDs.The beer felt cold and metallic and heavy on my tongue, in my throat, but about halfway through, my brain started to settle.It became easier - or perhaps necessary - to focus on anything else.Michelle (34) left a little while later, giving me a sloppy hug.She told me to watch out for these fools.I didnt know who these fools were supposed to be, but I told her I would.Anyways.Opie Daniels left at 1:45 a.m.  Metronome was going to close in fifteen minutes.Not quite last call.Outside the door, he pulled out a pack of American Spirits, yellow.He smacked them hard against the palm of his hand.He saw me watching him and tipped his chin at me.3845.There it was.Thirty-eight hundred.He looked so normal.He looked mid-thirties.Maybe a couple years older than me.There was no way.Opie Daniels lit one of his cigarettes and pulled in a deep drag, deep down into his lungs.He let out tendrils of smokes, slowly, deliberately.Like he was letting himself finally settle into a slow, still moment.Then he pocketed his cigarettes and started away.I know your ID is fake.  
	It didnt even sound like my voice.It was higher, more quavering, almost a whisper.There was a sudden ringing stillness in my body as Opie Daniels stopped, his back towards me.When he turned around, he was smiling wide, a giant, mischievous, open-mouthed grin.He was missing two teeth on his upper right side.You probably have to call the cops on me, heh.  A throaty, rasping laugh.Or do you think Im old enough?  
	I didnt answer.I didnt know how.I felt like I didnt know how to speak anymore.I clenched and unclenched my hands manically at my sides.Opie Daniels took a step back towards me, still smiling.He was taller than me.He took another drag on his cigarette, gaze locked on mine.There was an eerie glint in his eyes, something that spoke of something deep down and dark.Something that belied the smile on his face.Never have I felt so cold.He took another step closer to me.Close enough to smell the stale sweetness of old cigarette smoke.Something earthy and red.Something carnal and sharp and tinged with metal and iron.Something bad.His eyes were dark, sunken and I couldnt look away.He reached up with the hand not holding his cigarette and grabbed my lower lip hard, pulling it out away from my face, digging his nails into the flesh of my lips.And when he touched me, the air exploded, my blood screamed, everything broke.Blurrily, I saw him close his eyes and took a long, purposive inhale of my face, in through his nose, his nostrils quivering.When he exhaled, I swear he made a noise of pleasure, a low, scraping noise that sounded like, mmm.  
	He released my lip, studied my face for a moment, gave me a wink and said, dont work too hard.  
	And then Opie Daniels turned, took another drag from his cigarette, hiked up his pants and walked away.I never saw him again.It took me a long time to move.To even realize I was shivering.Hard.My teeth were chattering.I dont know what time I left the bar.I dont know when I got home.I dont know how I got home.I took a shower.I scrubbed my face until my mouth bled.I will never, ever talk about what I saw when Opie Daniels grabbed my lip.The next day, Wednesday, I watched sitcom reruns.I went to the grocery store and bought rice.I went to work and clocked in at Metronome and moved through all the motions of my day.Peoples ages popped above their heads just like normal (27, 30, 65, 42), and I checked IDs just like normal.I dont know if Im ok.I dont know.Anyways.
