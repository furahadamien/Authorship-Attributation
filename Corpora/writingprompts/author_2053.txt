So here I am face down on the floor of some Department store my sister dragged me to.It smells like feet and Im sincerely curious why my nose is flat and I cant feel my fucking legs.I somehow manage to literally peel my face off the floor when I suddenly feel hot.Like sweating because youre pretty sure your mom found your vibrator under your bed sweating.I start panicking when suddenly my surroundings change and Im lying face down in what looks like a bright red Sephora.I feel somewhat normal albeit hot as fuck, like why am I wearing a goddamned turtle neck?It smells like vanilla and pine Im so fucking confused.All of a sudden She slams down her well-manicured 6-pronged claw on the counter.I KNOW you want to torture humanity, BITCH!Ive been watching you bag groceries and do service-outs for the those unruly cunts for 15 fucking years.You think I didnt pick you for a reason?
I- uh who..
Girl you know who I am...
*fire balls and unholy hellfire flourish above Her*
Im assuming Im in hell.... great.Im trampled in a fucking department store yet I end up in hell.Fantastic.
She rapped her claws against the counter.So?!
I extended my hand and her claws dug in deep.Im in. 



Note Im responding on a whim for the first time!Be nice.
