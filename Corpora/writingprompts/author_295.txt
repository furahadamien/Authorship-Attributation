"So then I pulled out my sword and--" Piers paused mid sentence as he realised that Trisk's eyes had glazed over and she was staring intensely at the tankard in front of her like it had answers to the Riddle of the K'tun Cryptkeeper. "--I stabbed myself in the gut, twisted it, pretended to be dead for an hour, and then changed into a wildebeast and ran back here to make it in time for our weekly chat.""Mmhm."She breathed out a heavy sigh and played with the leather ties on her bracers."Hey.Trisk.Woohoo."He waved a hand in front of her face."Piers to Trisk."Her thoughts snapped back to the tavern and she shook her head."Oh.Huh?Oh."Her bright blue eyes met his and she half-smiled in apology."Sorry.I was thinking about that date I had last night."His heart thudded in his chest and it took all the effort he had not to look over-eager."You had a date last night?""Yeah.Remember when the guild sent me on that mission a week ago?I met this brawny barbarian on the road and he helped me fight off the manticore.""The one you killed?"She grumbled and then admitted, "Well truly he did most of the fighting.I just got the deathblow.He let me keep the head for the bounty."Piers felt pride swell."Nice guy."She frowned and his pride fizzled out."No.Not a nice guy.There was something really *off* about him."Piers swallowed before he carefully asked, "What makes you think that?""He was just too *barbarian*.It was weird.I mean.A fortnight ago I was on a date with that bard who was so simpering y'know.Like he wouldn't stop spouting off terrible lyrics to me and tried to hold my hand all day.His palms were sweaty."Piers grumbled."He did bring you your favourite flowers.""Yeah, but so many bouquets of flowers.Like, isn't that strange for a first date?My house smelled of elquids for days and then they all died and it was like death in there.I still can smell the rot.""Weren't you complaining to me that you didn't meet anyone sensitive?Artsy?"He gritted his teeth, trying not to show how frustrated he was."Sure, but that was ridiculous.Then the barbarian.What was that?"She lifted her hands up in the air which also happened to summon the barkeep to look up with the face of attentive barkeeps everywhere that said *More?* so Piers waved his hand and shook his head."Well, you did complain about the bard.You said you wanted someone more macho.Wasn't he macho enough for you?"She chewed on her lip.She did that when she was thinking.He knew that about her.He knew everything about her.That's what made this whole thing so frustrating."Yeah.And then almost a week to the day I meet the barbarian just happenstance to be on the road when I'm out questing and he was so -- just over the top.He grunted and threw things and he flexed.A lot.He wore a loincloth on our date.A loincloth.It was embarrassing."Piers was losing his patience just a little bit."So you're anti-barbarian."She huffed and she tapped her fingers on the table."I am not anti-barbarian.He was just so -- extra.Y'know?Like a farce of a barbarian.That's not what I want."Exasperated, Piers said, "Well what *do* you want?You said you wanted someone smart and so that week you met the scholar."She groaned in annoyance."Don't remind me.He read all the same scrolls I did and he went on and on about things that I like.It was so boring.Like I had that conversation a million times before.I have met stone walls more interesting than him.""Then you said you wanted a bad boy and when you got that --"

She cut him off. "--Don't even.He wasn't a bad boy.He was like some kind of weird trussed up dark elf gothic vampire wannabe who happened to be saving up to get a wyvern.The *same* wyvern that I'm saving up to get.Of course."She rolled her eyes."Then what will make you happy Trisk?""I don't know.I guess I'll know when I see him."She sighed and stared back into her tankard.He wanted to shout to her *When you see me!Why don't you see me?* but didn't because he couldn't because she had always been the little sister of his best friend.A best friend that had rules about friends and sisters and would be betrayed if Piers crossed that line.So Piers crossed a line that neither of them knew he could.Every week.Hoping that one day he could get it right.
