**"Flee, they're coming"**

That was the message broadcast to the world in complex repeating binary a hundred years ago.It took that long for scientists to recognize that it was a signal among all the noise and actually realize that the amount of energy necessary for it to be noticeable meant that somebody either very technologically advanced or very specifically interested in us wanted us to know.Whatever the reason was, once we realized the significance of that, we also realized that the implications sounded dire.That was seventy-five years ago.That was when the first ark ships were drafted, when we were nervous but we still had hope.The plan was everyone was to be moved off-world and to the nearest star, in the hopes that we would sidestep whatever threat was headed out way.As a species, we'd never accomplished anything even remotely like it before, having only some nascent colonies on the nearest planetary bodies.It required experimental technology and an unprecedented amount of cooperation, but it was worth it for the species.Forty years ago, five lights winked into the night sky in the southern hemisphere.Telescopes trained on them found them to be a brilliant blue-violet, so bright they were almost painful to look at.The scientific community erupted into debate.Governments tried their best to keep panic low, but a growing contingent of scientists were arguing that the blueshift of the objects put them at impossibly fast speeds towards us, and the timetable on the arks had to be pushed up.The tension on the planet was like a pot about to boil over.Most governments were still working, doing their parts to ensure our survival.Some nations were having problems, though.Society's scars showed themselves again, as previous enemies fell back into old habits with infighting and hate crimes.So much of the world was focused on the arks that there were precious few extra supplies to keep everyone else insulated from the hatred and violence of others.All throughout the fear, the lights in the night sky slowly shone brighter.Even the oblivious among us could not deny that the formation the lights were in bore a striking resemblance to the necklace worn by Saviik, an ancient shapeshifting goddess of destruction.It would have been a coincidence for most, had it not been for the fact that she's recognized in lore by the necklace she wears, no matter her form.Slowly, we lost more across the world to the old religions, as they abandoned their work on the ark and began to accept their demise in fervent prayer.Ten years ago, the first of the ark ships were completed.The world rejoiced, but only for a moment.Somebody - either noble or foolish, depending on who you ask - couldn't keep the secret any longer and revealed to the world that these would be not only the first, but the last of the ships.There were no plans to build any more, because there was no time.The barely restrained chaos could no longer be controlled.The world erupted into brutal war, as people fought desperately to secure a coveted spot on one of the arks.More blood was shed and atrocities were committed in the name of survival than had occurred in the previous two centuries.Families, neighborhoods, cities, entire nations tore themselves and each other apart, sometimes literally.The ark ships launched in desperation, most only partially full.Some of the more fanatical of Saviik's worshippers managed to sneak onto one of the arks and detonated it in the air, convinced that escape was tantamount to heresy in the wake of her purifying light.Millions of lives were lost in an instant.Five years ago all semblance of the world we once knew had disappeared entirely, as the last nation gave up the pretense of self-governance and collapsed.Our world was nothing but brutal and fearful tribes, cut off from contact with one another.I survived only by keeping my head down and scavenging what I could in the cities.A year ago I lost the last connection to my old life - my son died in my arms after we accidentally scared another group of scavengers.I watched the life leave his eyes as he bled into the street, the assailants running off into the night.Nothing about my life is the same as it was a hundred years ago.I curse the message for its omen, as I would have preferred to live out the last century in peace with my family, instead of in fear.I curse myself too because I can't bring myself to end my own life.I simply... exist.Sometimes in a state of acute bitterness, but mostly I am numb.An hour ago the lights entered our atmosphere, and one of them now hovers above the city.It's clearly a ship, and nobody knows what to make of it.Some prostrate themselves and mumble blessings feverishly.Some hold friends and family close.Some hide in the ruined buildings and cover their eyes.Some, like me, just stare.I try to keep impassive, but I can't help but feel my heart flutter.Could this be the end I'm finally looking for?Could I finally be at peace?The idea is almost too much to bear.The ship, after hanging still for so long, suddenly begins to shift.Surfaces on it unseal and change, the whole thing opens like some twisted flower pointed towards us.A light appears on the bottom, and a huge roar fills the air as the light crackles with angry energy.I feel the hair on my body stand up on end and I close my eyes, the faintest smile playing on my lips.The roar becomes deafening, drowning out the panicked wailing and ululating from us below.I tilt my head towards the sky, and the light sears through my eyelids.I am ready.But nothing comes.Instead, a small sound played like someone passing wind, and the flower opened up to reveal colored strips and squares of paper as they fluttered to the ground.A strange figure stood there on the ship in a suit, convulsing and making a strange barking noise at us, before speaking in a guttural language.It paused, fiddling with some controls on the suit, still barking and convulsing.Suddenly it was speaking our language.*"Oh, oh my god -"* it said doubled over between barks, *" - you should have seen the look on your faces."*

It took a while before it stopped barking, and then longer still before it stopped convulsing, and stood up straight.Then it cowered in mock fear, and went into another round of shaking.Eventually it stopped that too and looked out at us.*"Well,"* it said finally, gesturing out at the whole scene laid before it, *"good luck with all....this."*

And with that, it left.
