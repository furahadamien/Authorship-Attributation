50 years of isolation between the United States and the rest of the world was the best thing that ever happened to us.The United States was mocked endlessly by much of the rest of the world, despised by its rivals, and even by its own citizens' accounts, the country had serious problems.There was a growing disconnect between it and its allies.When it came down to it, their account of the events of the Eregenor situation was irreconcilable with our own.We simply couldn't possibly believe that the damning evidence that was presented against the United States was false, that is was some ridiculous plot by Russia, China, North Korea, and various other countries to try to make a world where they were in charge.World War 3 was hardly a bloodless war, but when the United States made the unthinkable call to deploy nuclear weapons once again to "prevent loss of life", much of the world was shocked and outraged.Was America willing to annihilate anyone who spoke against them?Former allies, worried that they may become enemies and face the same fate, came together with other representatives in secret, devising a plan.They agreed, reluctantly, that a program of isolation would be proposed in the UN, which would cut off all communication, and any who violated it would face stiff consequences.It would be sold to the U.S. as a positive thing- there was a tide of isolationism forming from internal anti-war sentiment and the criticism expressed by the rest of the world.The country felt that it was better off just taking care of itself... and with most of its enemies flattened, and none wanting it meddling in world affairs, it took a not entirely unwelcome chance to exit stage right.During the war, the U.S. had already been forced to deal with shortages and the end of many trade agreements it had become reliant on, and this combined with a helping of nationalistic pride gave confidence that the country could and should depend on its own resources going into the future.There were shortages for years afterwards; it was a shock to go from 0.6 USD per liter of gasoline [Author note: Using today's units for this] to a peak of ten times that, with how accustomed to cheap fuel the population was, with few remembering even the relatively minor panic of the 70's.It was a stressful time, but luckily the fertile soil was enough that for all the problems that were had, enough food was produced within the country and distributed by an evolved form of the wartime rationing board that starvation wasn't the serious threat it could otherwise have been.There wasn't a large supply of consumer electronics and goods, but there wasn't as much demand for such things when there was the more immediate concern of the economic upheaval of disconnecting a country from the global economy semi-permanently.But eventually a new status quo formed, where excess wasn't as tolerated, there were vastly more jobs to do than people to do them at every skill level, and where trimming the fat in government while investing into education and technology was seen as the logical way to improve, now that there were no sources for anything the country couldn't do for itself.Somehow a culture shift that brought together a more unified national identity overtook the United States in its period of isolation while the rest of the world, as connected as ever, divided into factions, squabbling in the power vacuum.The U.S. government must surely have instantly been aware what was truly going on; it's impossible in today's world to be so blind; but they in their own private meetings agreed it was worth playing dumb.It took far less than 50 years for the general public to become aware that it was the only one to have been isolated, but silence cuts both ways.As long as America was silent, nobody paid much attention.And so it quietly worked through its problems, which seemed so simple once it came right down to it, and began to prepare for the future.Canada was an essential part of the plan.The United States and Canada were too closely entwined to keep perfect isolation, and while for the first few years they shared nothing but information and what basic supplies could be covertly traded, eventually Canada served as a proxy buyer for whatever resources that couldn't be bought any other way.Of course, the fact that crucial international companies were American at heart did help.This was how America managed to advance so far in computer technology, making quantum computing practical and making incredible process in some aspects of nanoscale science.The upshot is both organic and inorganic programmable machines, vastly improved metamaterials (carbon based metas really took off with the shortages of certain elemental materials, for instance), slowed aging, the ability to break conventional encryption and to create unbreakable encryption in turn, and many open avenues of research into things which might have seemed like science fiction in the beginning of the twenty first century.When the rest of the world was ready, and snooping seemed to indicate they would be about as ready as could be hoped for, we would welcome them, and share what we had learned.[Auth - I need to get some sleep.I hope you like it; maybe I'll continue later on.Either way, I think it's a lot less depressing than some of the other stories, even if it's no more realistic than they.]
