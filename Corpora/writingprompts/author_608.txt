I couldnt believe it at first.I mean, I guess thats what anybody would say if the just discovered they were the worlds most powerful super villain .I know right?A freaking super villain!It started while doing research for a school project.Just me, going to the library, ditching the shelves of carefully written and fact checked books for the lawless internet of un checked information, when I came across a website.Forgottenvillansofseattle.com 
(Dont ask how my research led me there)
I was amused at first, obviously it was a joke.Then I saw a picture of myself.Had I discovered my doppelgnger?My interest piqued.I started reading.Apparently I had once been the most powerful villain in Seattle, with the power to convince people of things using only my words.Oh, and I could move objects using my mind.Basically I was a Jedi.An evil Jedi.So a sith I guess?Anyway, about 3 years ago I had risen to power to the amazement of many in my small city outside Seattle.A nine year old accomplishing amazing things.I wanted control, and fish.So I set my sights to Seattle, the jewel of the Pacific Northwest (screw you Portland).But Seattle was protected.Erica wentz put a stop to me.Our local superhero.Shes great.Well, I used to think she was... now Im not so sure.I had power, prestige and at age 9!Now Im a socially awkward, anxious 13 going on 14 year old who can hardly talk to a crowd, let alone control a city.Thats part of the reason I wrote this.To see if my powers are still there.To see if reading my words is enough to convince you of what I once was.Maybe its time for Eileen vs Erica vol.2.Watch out Seattle.Your favorite evil Jedi is back.
