The mug was in the back yard shed with most of my dads things.I had gotten them when he passed away.It stood there with a big number one on it.I decided to bring it inside, since i had known to me he had been my number one dad.When i touched it the number changed.I hadn't been with a girl in about a year.I hadn't dated in almost 3.I was a dad.The number was insanely high.But i didn't know i was a father until i touched it, so i guess... that was fine.It bothered me though.I mean it would bother anyone.698,589.It was a non-scripted kind of number.The kind you would see on a prison inmates shirt.The kind of number I felt like.I called Cristina.We had dated for 3 years, i almost popped the question, but then her grandparents died and she said she needed time to think her life over.And we just fell out of touch.She was the last girl i was with.The conversation was pretty normal.I am good how are you, me too, thanks for asking.But like word vomit it came spilling out of my mouth like a a wet shit on a hot day."DID YOU GIVE BIRTH TO A CHILD OF MINE WITHOUT ME KNOWING?"The receiver was quiet for a long time.Then you could hear her breathing on the other end in a sobbing tone."I had an abortion without telling you."I wasn't sure if it was yours, John, I cheated on you.Thats why i left.I felt to guilty."I knew i shouldn't but i felt relief.Not a dad here.I told her it didn't bother me and hung up after saying we should get coffee some time.She seemed stunned but i was on a mission.The next number i called wasn't as good of a lead.Tristan was her brother.He picked up, her phone, he asked me how i was, what kind of day i was having, and if i had heard from his sister at all.Told me all about his weekend out cracking cold ones with the boys.There it was again, the bile taste, The acid."DID YOUR SISTER HAVE MY CHILD AND NOT TELL ME?"He laughed as my voice cracked.then when he stopped he said, "Maybe, I havent heard from her since you two dated.""why do you have her old number?"Oh she gave me this phone the last time we saw each other.It had her number, but i just told all her friends it was mine now, and kept it.You mean you don't know where she is?"I couldn't answer right away.Then after a while all i could managed was, "I'm coming over, Be ready for me."and hung up.
