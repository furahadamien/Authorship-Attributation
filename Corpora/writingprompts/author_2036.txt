"Brother.."

&nbsp;

Abel stared at the frail man laying on the bed.His skin and bones stretched thin and wrinkled.His face looked like falling smudge.His eyes, once strong and determined*spiteful*now damp and damaged beyond repair.Abel stared long, and the dying man stared back.The man opened his mouth but Abel made a shushing sound, telling him there was no point to speak anymore."You are safe," Abel whispered.The man complied as he sunk his white-stringed head.Shame.Regret.Anger.Scorn.All of it, painted in a single frame of motion.Abel shook his head."You never changed," he said softly.The man looked at him, eyes as wide as it could.He tried to reach out his hand, but Abel only smiled at the attempt."You can't.Not anymore."He wore a coal black cloak he received from God.He never understood why, but he only assumed God already knew what Abel hadn't had any wits left to understand.God told him that he would use it, one way or another, to fulfill the gap in his spirit.God always had been a mysterious figure.Abel would have blamed Him, spite God Himself, if it weren't he knew already of his inevitable death.But Abel had, to be honest, so he told God he wasn't ready yet."**My child, none in the living was ever ready.**" God explained.He reached his finger onto Abel's forehead.It calmed him, he was no longer shaking with fear."**None.Not even I.**"

Abel didn't understand at the time, not until now."How could you not be?"He asked.God smiled at him."**Because I am *living* as well.**"

*This must be the reason for the cloak, am I wrong Father?* Chained from underneath his cloak, he pulled a lantern.A small black chamber framing a clear glass.But it was empty.No wax candle, no oil and wick.It had no fire, but eager to be filled.Abel stared at the clear glass, inside the lantern.His reflection showed an ethereal shape of his former self.Finally, he opened the door of the empty miniature cage.Abel stretched his empty hand above the withered man's chest.The man gasped and tried to shout for help, but all for naught.Abel shushed him again, this time the room went silent.The man struggled on his bed, but Abel's voice ceased his attempts to move."Now, now... no need to struggle."His voice hummed an unnatural tone.No birds chirped, no trees rustled.Not a single whisper from the wind.There were only Death and a dying man."Your spirit may remain thee, tainted one.No more marked by God.What remains but a light on my path."Something whirled into Abel's hand.His empty hand, no more empty.A mossy green ball of light stared at Abel, and he started back as well.It was calm, peaceful even.It didn't float away, it didn't struggle out of his grasp.It stood there, in his hand.No amount of pain covered the ball of light.Not shame.Not regret.Not anger.Not even scorn.Even without his command, the ball floated towards the lantern.Reflecting its light on the clear glass.Inside the empty black chamber.Abel smiled."Let us walk together brother," he whispered."wherever eternity bridge our path, Cain.""I've been wondering, Grim Reaper."The man beside Death suddenly spoke.He was ethereal now.No more of his physical body remained.Only a spirit walked beside Death."What is it, young man?"Death asked.In his hand, held a chained black lantern from his coal black cloak.The lantern hummed a sweet mossy green light towards their path."Do you think I'm ready?"The spirit asked."Ready for what?""What happens beyond."Death smiled at him."No one remains ready, young man."Death reached his finger onto the man's forehead.The spirit relaxed, no more of his form wavering away."None.Not even Death."The spirit nodded.Silence filled them, a calm whisper of serenity.Then the spirit spoke again."Is it always dark here?"He asked.Death nodded."Yes, darkness always filled these roads.The Roads of Eternity, God named it.""Is that why you always keep that lantern?"The spirit continued."You've always been depicted with a lantern.I was surprised when I discovered the truth in them."He pointed at the lantern, his ethereal head tilting into a question."Is it really for lighting your way?'Death smiled and shook his head."This is to keep me company."
