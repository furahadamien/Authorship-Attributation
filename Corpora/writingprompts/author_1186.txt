"It's the will of a heart, not the tool that makes a man a warrior!""Thor, calm yourself, no doubt he is deserving, he killed like 10 normans with it."Exclaimed Tyr, Lord of justice."Wait what?How is this even a debate?Where's Baldr?"Asked Odin
"Loki killed him dad" they all reply."Right, well Loki what's your say in all this?"Loki looks up from his distracted mind."What?This crazy mother fucker killed dudes WITH A SPATULA!What debate even I just brought him here for giggles, look at this spongey little bastard he's adorable and a bloodthirsty warrior"
The room is drowned with curses and insults at Loki, angry for calling them all to council for his blatant nonsense."Uhm, can I go check out the hall now or uh--"
"SILENCE!"Thunder rolls and Poseidon, god of the sea appears, "this man is my fry cook, you gods of the north have no right to his soul in the afterlife!"He firmly states.Thor and Loki make eye contact, pub music starts playing and Poseidon is thoroughly beaten and kicked back into the sea.Odin lowers himself to the greatest manager of mortals, "son, you have lived the life of a saint, vanquisher of evil and liberator!both through humble service as well as glorious battle you have ascended to a level of nirvana none in this room can match.You are now a God boy!"
