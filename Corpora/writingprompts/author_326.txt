The cashier in front of me froze, his eyes narrowing.I'd read books where the author described someones eyes as being calculating, but I thought I could actually see him doing math.Weighing variables, probabilities and even analyzing a threat."Care to repeat that?"He asked, though it was more of a command.His previous, jolly personality gone, replaced by a flat sheet of the coldest ice.It was unnerving."I, uh, I said I'd like a number one meal.Large.Are you okay?"He stared for a second more, then his jolliness was back, the ice melted."Of course.Coming right up.Will that be all?""Uh... Yeah.That's it."I swiped my card and sat at the table to wait.As I ate my burger, I could feel his gaze in my back, even while he helped other customers.The burger tasted bland as I ate it as fast as possible, so I could get away from this strange man.I had put it all behind me when I pulled up to my house, ready to relax.Coat abandoned on the floor for tomorrow, I sat and turned on the TV, beer in hand."Kind of you to join me, Kaitlyn."I jumped to my feet, spilling my beer on the couch."What the fuck?!Who are you?Why'd you follow me?"He sat cross legged on the armchair, unnoticed until now."I'm afraid I will be conducting the interrogation today.You see, you are speaking a language that's not only dead, but extinct.No one should know of it, save myself.The fact that you even know *about* would make me shudder in fear if I were capable.The implications alone make me consider if killing you now would be for the best.I offer you a rare opportunity in my line of work.A chance.How do you know how to speak English, and how did you follow me through The Gate?"My brain had decided to call it quits, and to be fair, shock is a helluva drug.This man was talking about dead languages and gates.He put a lot of emphasis on his mention of the gate.I didn't know of any gate.I'd never even heard of English.Of course, I knew he was just hearing me speak in his native tongue, but the fact that he said no one but himself should know of it was throwing me off.I must have paused too long because he sighed and began to reach for a long, steel blade."Wait, wait, wait!Hear me out.I have a special power.I can speak and understand any language.People always hear me in their native tongue, so that's what's happening, you're hearing me speak English.Please don't kill me."He took his hand off of the blade and nodded to himself."I see.Yes.I will not kill you.""Oh, God.Thank you-"  
"You will be most useful."Everything went black.
