The Lord came down to Georgia, he was trying to track the devil down.He was in a bind but catching up since the devil escaped hell.When he came across the devil pouting and whining over a loss, he zapped himself right down sayin: Boy let me tell you what: Now I bet you didnt know it, but you just won the devils soul, and if youd care to live with me youll give it up right here.You play a pretty good fiddle son, and Ill give you one above, but lay it down right now else Ill have to take you on.The boy said: My names Johnny and I know now that its a sin, but Ill take you on you son of a gun cuz Im the best theres ever been.Johnny rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard, cos the lords upset in Georgia and he made the fucking cards.And if you win you get to take that fiddle back home now, but if you lose The Lordll crush your soul!The lord made his own fiddle o gold sayin its time to get this on!, and light came from the fiddle, n took the shape of his bow.When he pulled the bow across the strings and it sounded just like bliss, but no band of angels joined in, cuz he knew he could handle this.(Fiddle music)

When His God finished, Johnny said Yup youre better than me old man, I realize Ive made a huge mistake in trying to take you down. Johnny didnt get a choice in playin against him now, when Johnnys own fiddle came to life it started to break down.He played:

- 
Gods on the mountain, run Johnny run!God made the house of the rising sun.Chicken in a bread pan picking out dough, devil does your dog bite?No child no.-

Johnny bowed his head because he knew that hed been beat, and he laid his life down on the ground at Gods feet.The Lord said Johnny just stand on up you know youre still my son!Yes you tried and you were beat by pride but at least one of us won.
