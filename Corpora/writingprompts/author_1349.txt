I'm taken away once more, and slowly awake in a hospital bed.I feel weak, my whole body hurts.I notice stitches down the right side of my torso.What did she need?

For 9 centuries I have survived
Told of the dangers it causes our insides
Avoiding pure H20.Thirsty; my body is water deprived
I'm torn inside, emotionally divided
Gotta drink.It's time to go.
