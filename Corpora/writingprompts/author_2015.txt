Knotted_Mess
Everyone I've ever known and loved is dead and gone, I walked with them through the journey to the last door.And I have to say, none of these tests compare to the difficulty of guiding them through knowing all the while they don't see me.They don't recognize my face as it's been reduced to milky white stone.And when my last lover passed, she looked right through me ...Fear in her eyes.That's when I knew; death would never find me and my ass would always be nothing but a pile of bones, cold and alone.But that's no surprise.This place is where I'm doomed since my demise.No one to share these thoughts with, I continue on even when I feel like I can't take this anymore.Everyday, I ask myself what I did to deserve this fate.And everyday, I get no answer but the sound of the gate.Opening for everyone except the person I hoped it would finally be.
