First, there came the oceans.Each planet layers upon layers of cool darkness, with cores of ice and fire.In the worlds without Earth, creatures larger than the planets themselves wander in the darkness between galaxies, and the smaller ones live upon the clouds or deep beneath the surface of the water.In the place with no Air, everything is one with the world around it.The tides are unchanging and the trees do not grow.The people of this universe know not the meaning of barriers, as they pass through solid matter as easily as a man falling through a gust of wind: all is dense and hot and unfeeling, with nothing to stretch the space from the earth to the sky.Living things burrow deep into the rich soil and stay there for many years.The kingdom without Fire is a space without light.There is water to drink and dirt to walk upon, but no stars to shine above or warm hearths waiting below.The quiet, velvet darkness of the void reigns over every world within it.They have learned to communicate in whispers and hands; long, pale fingers caressing the paths before them, sightless eyes that never blink.The absence of Water in the fourth realm is a strange emptiness, as well.The air crackles with electricity and the acrid scent of ozone never leaves.Most beings are flat and dark, moving across the cracked surfaces of planets like shadows.They feed off sunlight and warmth and little else, moving slowly throughout the day with the many suns in their skies.Most curious of all is the universe without magic.So many world exist with elements in abundance: entire planets of liquid and ice, enough sunlight to feed thousands of shadows, and yet they remain barren.No one walks the spaces between them.However, every now and then, life will begin on a planet despite lacking the spark of magic, purely due to the four remaining elements existing in harmony.Enough Water to create clouds in the air, enough Earth to receive the rain.Enough Fire to light the way, and enough Air to freely move.The creatures here create magic for themselves, by harnessing the existing energies and creating more of their own.Strange beings of iron and steel that glide across surfaces faster than any animal.Metal contraptions that move mountains and dig caverns.This place without magic is empty, and yet it is the the strangest of the five worlds.They are not yet aware of what truly lies beyond them.--
