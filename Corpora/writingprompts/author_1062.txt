Why did I always follow the green line - I thought to myself.It has been 20 years since I first steeped into it without knowing where it would lead me, unbknowest to me it had led me to a path of great success but I had always asked myself what would have happened if I had followed the red line.In this life I have, I got everything I dreamed about a beautiful husband and 3 gorgeous kids, 2 daughters and a son.My life was perfect, or so I thought there was desire burning deep inside me, it hurt, it felt like a fire burning in my heart.Something was missing.This fire had been corrupting my mind, I started to become easily irritated even though I stopped caring about anything.Something was different today, I woke up and not even my kids could make my day shine, I tried everything to soften this feeling of dread, everything but one thing.I was losing my mind and that was when I decided to follow the red line, just this once, just today.It led me to a grocery store, where I had been many times before, nothing unusual.After I left the grocery store I dragged myself to the children's park with the help the line.The park had 2 swings and a red slide, it was desert at this time of the day apart from a teenage couple sitting in one of the benches.The boredom I felt had not dimmed even a little was the red line exactly like the green line, where they different paths that led me to the same place?Where they the same thing?After 4 hours chasing after it, I  I couldn't tell if it was any different.My existential boredom continued to not fade away would this dread never be put to rest.The red line was fruitless, a complete disappointment.I looked around, I didn't recognize anything, where had I gone in my despair.I was lost, so I turned to the only thing that I knew to do, follow the green line but it was thinner than ever.It wasn't more than 20 meters until it completely disappeared into a green circle.Finally something interesting I thought.I started running, sprinting and dashing to get to the circle as fast as possible what could possibly have done this.I extended my hand to touch the middle of the circle and that was when I saw the loudest noise and the strongest light I had ever seen.I turned to the source of the noise just in time to see the car racing toward me.In that moment which felt like an eternity, I could clearly see the eyes of the driver.I can't be certain, but I'm sure I saw something in the reflection of those eyes.It looked very much like a red line pointing right at me.(Sorry for the sudden ending lmao, I had another idea but ran out of time / Thanks crybannanna)
