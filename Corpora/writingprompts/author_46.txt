Its finally ready.

I stood back and marvelled at our creation.We had taken an ordinary refrigerator, and turned it into a time machine.Now, you might ask, why we did this.Building the time machine was just the first part of our mission.We knew that this was our only hope of restoring freedom to the Internet.That freedom had been taken away 20 years ago.I was just a child at that time, so I had no memory of it.I thought back to that fateful day when I discovered the truth.The year was 2024.My grandfather had died, and left my parents, my sister, and I a very important box in his will.Inside the box was what appeared to be a pile of radio aerials and computer chips, along with a note.> For the past few years, I have attempted to discover the secret of time-travel.I have made a fair bit of progress, but I will not be around to see the results of my work.The time has come for you to continue my work.Once you have created a working time machine with these spare parts, go back to 2017 and ensure that Net Neutrality is preserved.Remember, Ajit Varadaraj Pai opposes Net Neutrality.Good luck!Whats Net Neutrality? I remembered asking.Dad then sat down with me, and started talking.Back when you were just a baby, the Internet was not as you know it today.Back then, it didnt matter if a website or service was a tiny minnow in a sea of sharks: you could still access it the same way you access anything else on the internet.But that all changed in 2017.Now, many websites and services have been blocked, throttled, or put behind a paywall, severely restricting what could be done on the Internet.

So back then, you didnt have to pay a monthly fee to browse Reddit? I asked.Precisely, said Dad.I then nodded, brimming with determination.For the next 14 years, we got to work at building a time machine.At first, my involvement with the project was limited to passing a wrench every once in a while.Eventually, I got involved with the proverbial heavy lifting.Now, it was finally time for us to go back and set right what went wrong.Dad pressed a few buttons on a remote control, then stashed the controller in a small backpack.He climbed into the fridge wearing the backpack, then the rest of us followed.Bit of a tight squeeze, my sister mused.Before any of us could respond, we felt the fridge lifting up into the air and spinning.After what felt like an eternity, the spinning stopped.The door of the fridge then opened.We were in a lush, green field, with several houses in the distance.Now to find this Ajit Pai fellow, said Mum.But, where are we?

I have no idea where we are, but I know exactly when we are, said Dad.Its the 1st of November, 2017.
