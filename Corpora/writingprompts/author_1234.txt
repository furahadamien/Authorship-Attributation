A young man wakes up.He's visiting his family for the holidays, over a thousand miles away from his humble abode across the country.*I blame Manifest Destiny.*


This Christmas isn't much unlike any other day, considering how dysfunctional his family is.His father and sister aren't speaking to each other, his parents constantly argue about trivial things, and he feels at times that it is his duty to repair the fragmented family he left behind.But he rejects that duty; for this working young man is just all too tired.For now, he simply wishes to relax and enjoy his vacation in the comfort of this motley group of oddballs who love him unconditionally.The simple things bring joy to this young man's somewhat desolate existence, such as visiting one of his favorite websites and reading a thread title with some comforting words in it.It's things like this that remind him that life is worth living, no matter what.*It's gonna be a fine Christmas.*
