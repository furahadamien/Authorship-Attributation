Father woke up in the morning to find his favorite mug no longer said #1 Dad, but now said 1,000,000,000,000,000,000% Dad.He was quite pleased by this new ranking.Being a dad of this percentage he went up to his children and kissed them all on the forehead before heading off to his white collar job in Cleveland, Ohio.
