Note: I wrote until I was too exhausted yo go on but I didnt manage to wrap it up particularily well.Might write more.I could write a whole book about Max Harding and Charlotte Fien.In high school I was dating a guy named Max Harding.I was just a confused teenager and the cute but weird emo kid kind of became my sweetheart.I was kind of a grunge girl and was in love with Kurt Cobain but this cute guy came up to me and asked me if I had a light for his cigarette.He kind of had something in his eyes.Some kind of deep seated emotional turmoil.I got the impression that he wasnt your every day edgy emo teenager.He seemed to actually hate himself, and I felt so bad for him.Days were spent smoking weed and relaxing while listening to rock songs.We would go for walks in the city and he had his charm but he got weirder and weirder.He seemed obsessed with me, but it didnt make sense how he behaved.There was a deeper issue.He would tell me about these strange thoughts he had and while I would be very captivated, he seemed destined for life on the street.In time his suffering became too much and I had to leave him, for my own sake.It wasn't the right thing to do but it made me so confused, angry and overall unable to love him how he needed.He started picking fights with guys who as much as hinted that they didn't approve of us and myself in particular.He was sweet but I thought life would be better for him without me and even though I might think about him sometimes as time goes on I dont miss him.I'm much happier without him and I thought he would easily get over me based on how he reacted when I broke up with him.He said "Ok, that's fine."Then he took a last puff of smoke and left my appartment that I lived in at the time and as he left he turned around in the doorway and smiled."Cya on the other side!"he said with a giant grin.It was the first time I saw him smile with his eyes.I never thought those words would be more than an empty phrase but years later something strange happened.I got in debt with the mafia.I developed a drinking problem and I developed bipolar, mania and depression.I don't remmember how it happened, in the hospital they convinced me that it was all a dream and I believed that until I got out and the thugs came to visit.I was stressed out.No way I could pay off 3 millions in debt.I told them, "I don't have the money, I can't pay off the debt!"and the scary looking criminal just told me "That's fine.My boss will be dissapointed but I'll tell him you said that.I don't know the details but I was instructed to give you this number and we'll erase the debt."Then he left.I stood there for what seemed like years, and without thinking I called the number.I talked to some guy that I had never met before.He seemed friendly.In the middle of the conversation, which I don't remmember he said he had a message for me, "The guy you're looking for lives on Tinker Street.The big house in the middle with the big fence and camera at the entrance."I wrote down the adress and started asking a lot of questions.He explained to me that I was on a list of protected people thanks to this guy, who was a big mover in the underground.The next days I was so angry, confused and on the verge of losing my sanity.I went to Tinker street in a manic state but I couldn't find the big mansion he was talking about.In the middle of my dreamlike quest for finding the elusive billionaire I somehow ended up at Maxes old place.47 Tinker Street.I walked up to his house and rang the doorbell.I just wanted answers.I was angry, manic and on a mission.He opened the door, shirtless, with long pink hair and fingerless white leather gloves.He looked happy.He had ripped jeans and a bit of a stubble."Charlotte?"he said, sounding smug.I got kind of angry and said "Max I dont have time for your antics Im looking for an eccentric billionaire.""Oh?Where does he live then?"I looked at the note with the address."27 Tinker Street."He smirked and said with no apparent hint of irony "I wouldn't say I'm a billionaire, but if you want me to be then I can get the money by wednesday."I broke down crying after that.I dont remmember what I said but I refused to believe in anything he said.He had always been a compulsive liar.He told me that he still loved me, but I knew he was lying.Then he told me the story of what happened after our breakup.He quit smoking weed and started doing breaking and entering.He got so good at it, that after a while he had a good bunch of cash so he invested it in 5 kg of Kush.Then he started saying how he got more and more people working for him and eventually buildt up an organization.It had no name but they had taken over major crime syndacutes just by reputation alone.He had been watching me from the distance and when he heard I was in debt with the mafia he gave them a call and went to negotiate.He made the don an offer he couldn't refuse.Max had apparently gone there all by himself and told him "Charlotte Fien is protected by me, I want 5 million for the trouble and I want you to back off."The mafia boss just said "I could, but I'd need four weeks to get the money," then he kind of stopped mid sentance, nervously paced around, although very slowly and finally said "I'll give you 3 million, we wont harm the girl, and I'll never see you again."Max said that was okay, shook his hand and never saw him again.I was finally lucid again.I wasnt nervous anymore.Max Harding is the man of my dreams.
