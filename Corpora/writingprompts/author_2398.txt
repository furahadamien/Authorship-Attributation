I collect them all.Like they collect baseball cards, or poke balls or whatever its called these days.Heroes, demigods, humans, animals, all creatures big and small, I collect them.They dont know Im collecting, yes some have that look in their eyes when I come, they know time is up.But in the middle of their bustle they dont know of it.Sure in hushed whispers they say my name, thinking they have time.But as Ive been collecting since before time.I know theyll sooner or later be added to my collection.My name, oh I have been called many.Today you may not know my name, but you can call me Death.
