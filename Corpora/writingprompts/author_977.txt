Great shadows began to form over Derry once more.Big dark things gathering like storm clouds on the horizon or monsters come up from under the bed.Lesser evils could sense the change coming like rain on the wind and reacted in kind.Ka is a wheel that keeps turning, and evils time had come once again.Many miles away in the greatest city this land had ever known creatures of the dark had begun reacting to the change.Those many mindless things that skitter and slither through the dark and the damp had simply been driven mad by it, coming out of their holes to attack the unwary creatures of the light.However those more mindful minions of the dark could feel themselves being drawn towards the sewers of some far off place.This year was special, this wakening was going to be different, they could feel it.And so they slunk out of their homes leaving the city in the chaos of the lesser creatures to seek that dark blot on the horizon calling out to them.Splinter looked despondently up at the clouds listening to the distant cries and wail of sirens carried to him by the wind.It wasnt fair.Maturins grandchildren had only just reached their nineteenth summer and he had nearly a century of training under his belt before he had been called up to protect his side of the beam.But time had run out.He had been feeling the quakes for months, tremors from the East shaking him out of his sleep and stealing away his breath in the night.Something ancient, evil and hungry was drawing near, threatening everything they had been born to protect.He knew more than he wished of evil and its ways, and had raised his boys in the dark and damp places evil liked to dwell, trained them to act as one, and Gan willing, they would prevail.
