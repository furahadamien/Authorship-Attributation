Nothing exciting ever happens around here in New Zealand.I say that because most people don't even know where New Zealand is, let alone anything that ever happen down here.The fact that I live in a small town about 2 hours drive from anywhere worth mentioning also doesn't help, but I've found a job that fits me to a T. I mean, not every bouncer can see people's ages floating above their heads, right?This is not some Peter Jackson Frightener movie, this is real life.Real life means I have to work for my dues, whatever that means.I am not complaining about my special ability.Believe me, it is one thing that you can tell how old one person is just by staring at the space slightly above their head, but it is totally awesome when you can see everybody's number.To be honest, it's the young ones that shock me the most.They just don't treat their body right these days.I see their haggard faces every night, standing in the cold, wearing next to nothing.I can tell how old they are, but some of them look closer to thirty than eighteen.Of course you can't let those ones in, it's the rule.I didn't make the rule.It is September already.You'd think this winter will finally end and we will get some flowers out of the ground, right?Spring is supposed to be here, but no.It is still freezing.The line isn't very long tonight even though it's Saturday.The place I work for is usually full in the weekend, but not tonight.It has stopped raining though.I suppress a yawn.We have a group of students with their IDs in their hands, eager to get inside.I don't blame them.Pulling the dark jacket closer to me, I pretend to scan them up and down, and look at their IDs quickly.I don't need to see them or do any mental calculations.I know they can go in.That's why I waved, yes, you have a fun night.Not sure if you will find it in there, but good luck.You will get what you wish for.I don't know why I haven't noticed this earlier, but I guess it's because the guy from the group was too tall and he blocked my view.My usual icy stare is hard to maintain when the number above the well-dressed man flashed when I look up.I have to stop myself physically, not losing my composure because I know what I saw."Hi, brother.I've come to have some fun tonight.""ID, please."As if a card is going to prove how old he really is."Oh, can you see it with this light?"I can hear him alright, but I can't let him through.I've been trying to find him after all this time, and when I finally found him, I am powerless to stop him.Powerless to catch him."I can, and brother, remember why you are here."He has the audacity to scoff before stepping into the club in his fancy patent leather shoes.His number is 6666.That's his number.My name is Michael and he's my brother.I've been waiting for him forever and this is why I am calling my partner from inside the club.This one can't get away.
