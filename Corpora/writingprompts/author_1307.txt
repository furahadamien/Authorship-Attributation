"Oh.My.God.Rebecca.What?""Steve!Thank goodness you're here.I need help.""Yeah...I know... What is it this time?Homework?Dishes?Need something heavy moved?""No.""Well, what is it then?""I...I can't open this jar.""What?!?Seriou..."

"Steve!That's not the only thing.I. I'm.I'm also out of toilet paper.I need you.""*sigh* Rebecca, do you realize I have my own life?I've got things I need to take care of myself.I can't keep popping up here anytime you are inconvenienced.This is getting ridiculous.I'll be back with some paper in a minute, let me see that jar.""Th-Thanks."Rebecca watched with tears welling in her eyes as Steve stormed out of her apartment, open jar in hand."One day he'll see.One day he'll realize he still loves me.One day he won't leave.Right?"she thought as she closed the unused jar and placed it in the fridge."He's got to know I've been calling him here because I still love him."A forceful knock at the door snapped her from her thoughts.She opened the door to a pack of toilet paper from the bodega downstairs on the welcome mat and Steve nowhere to be found.Tears now streaming down her face she bent down and picked up the package."Maybe next time."she thought.
