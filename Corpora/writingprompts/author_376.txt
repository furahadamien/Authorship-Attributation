The black velvet curtains snapped and whirled around as the heat and wind permeated through their faded fabric.While hiding him from the gaze of those who have gathered in the pantheon they did little to hide the smell of sulfur emanating from the pit just on the other side.Steve opened and closed his scarred, aging hands.Callused, cracked, and scabbed, they ached.The fingernails held a slight crust of blood under them.Dirt intermingled and entwined on the hairs on his knuckles.One more he said under his breath.Just one more.As he held up his hand to the faint candle, he could feel it shaking.There were no smiles in this place, no happiness.He knew what awaited him should he fail again.A veiled figure filled out from the darkness.No steps could be heard, as if he floated above the damp stone floor of the holding pit in the pantheon.A dark crimson robed arm reached forward and put a black, dead hand upon his back.Steve's shoulders instinctively raised, as if to guard not from a hand, but from a blow.Where the hand lay on his khaki shirt, the skin below felt cold, as if being burned by ice.Behind the darkness of the vail a voice whispered out,  "This is your last one.Tie this creature up, and you will be free.12 has been your number, and this will be your last.Fail, and you must start again."Steve's hand opened one more time, as if he had won his prize already.As is he could already feel his child's hand folding into his palm once again.He reached out for the black curtain, and pulled it aside, stepping into the light, the feeling of his child's hand slipping once again from his mind.
