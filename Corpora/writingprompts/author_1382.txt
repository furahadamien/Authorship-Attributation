I came to.The buzzing subsided.So too did those indescribable physical sensations.The feeling of being a part of actual physical matter.Yet at the same time retaining the sense of my true conscious being.I didn't think such a thing was possible.My friends were looking at me expectantly."Dude, are you alright?"Their voices even retained a semblance of that physical dimension, like they were coming from the vibration of oxygen and hydrogen molecules.But, of course, such a notion sounded absurd even coming out of the trip."It was like I was matter.""What do you mean, 'matter'?Like atoms?""Yeah, but they were all working together, like I was controlling them from the inside.In a way, I was God.""Sounds intense.""It's like being reborn.At first, things appear bright, like the way you experience them when you were as a kid.So you become transfixed by these images and you can interact with these physical things and it's very brightly coloured and amazing.But that's not what's truly amazing - what's amazing is the way it makes you think.Like you're thinking for the first time, like really becoming self-aware.But then you become afraid.You see these shadow people, out of the corner of your eye at first, but then they seem realer and realer, almost like they could hurt you.And then it's like they're infecting you.And that magical feeling you felt at the start of the trip turns to one of horror.Like the most horrifying things you wouldn't have dared to imagine are staring you down and you can't look away.And that's when they seem like they must be real.Realer than real.But as the trip subsides you realise that none of it is real and that nothing can hurt you ever.And that the things you thought were real were just illusions of your own creation and everything that was real was overshadowed by the intensity of these illusions.And you feel deep regret too because you realise your part in creating these monsters, these illusions.And that's when I started crying, like really bawling -"

"Yeah we noticed," piped Zimmerman."Sounds really profound," said Zax sarcastically."Shut up Zax, let me finish."I continued, as though I was on the cusp of some grand truth, although this could just be the fractal dust still talking."But it was cleansing, you know?I released all these demons and I realised the greatest demon was myself and all I had to do was let it go.All I had to do to defeat the monsters was accept them and they went away.Well, not really, 'went away', but sort of became not 'monsters' anymore - just a part of a trip.Like I saw them for what they truly were and was supposed to learn something from them.And it's like I saw the meaning of life.God, what was that thing again?But I can tell you how I felt.I wasn't happy, wasn't sad, but more a mixture of both.It was beautiful.A beautiful sadness.You probably don't have a clue what I'm talking about.But it felt like something was revealed to me that day.It didn't just feel like getting fucked up.It felt like being enlightened, like a portal to another dimension.""Sounds trippy.Give it here."
