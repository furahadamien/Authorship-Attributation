Being a time traveler can suck sometimes.&#x200B;

These days I find myself bored, but not in the have nothing to do sense.Quite the opposite, theres plenty to do, but I lust for enjoying the same thing over and over.Kinda like watching a rerun of your favorite episode of some trashy TV show.Currently, my vice of choice is pranking my former employer.&#x200B;

My mentor, known only as Mr E. taught me I had to blend in to not be found.That sounded like a load of bull, having watched the man loot precious treasures from times long past.If youve ever wondered why King Tuts cache was never found, or why so many sunken ships go missing, thats Johns doing.Hed type a quick Google search of how to enter a specific tomb or where a sunken ship was found, then time jump to the day after shit it the fan.&#x200B;

I however, have lived the quintessential mediocre life my entire existence.Office life isnt quite the way TV shows picture it.Growing through my teens and into an adult without dreams, I contented to my comfortable dead end job as a telemarketer.Working at Call4Me was a comfortable routine, it was a paycheck that afforded me some of lifes pleasures.When the boss called me in to give me the news, I was devastated.His smirk irked me, enjoying watching me squirm in discomfort.Some things you never forget, that moment was one of them.The end of a forgetful Friday, he called me into his office.I had one last call on the line; putting it on hold, I rushed towards the fogged glass door labeled Bart Kobold.&#x200B;

Pack your things Steve, youll be given todays pay in addition to the severance package. He stayed seated, adjusting things on his immaculate desk, not even acknowledging me.Sweating, looking for something to say, my hands fidgeting my tie and shirt buttons.We all knew about 20% of the building was being laid off this month.They could pay kids in India a quarter our wage for the same outcome.&#x200B;

Cowardly I turned and walked out, low self-esteem paired well with my lack of ambition.Sorry, it was all I could do, please close the door behind you. I numbly obeyed and wandered to my blanch cubicle.&#x200B;

There was a box on my desk with a sticky note, likely from my supervisor.Sorry  -Karen. At least packing my things was easy, just my yellow notepad, BiC pen and a couple sci-fi favorites.We could read in-between calls, reading fantasy likely helped me stay sane.&#x200B;

The hold light from my phone console blinked.Not even registering my immediate unemployment, my brain fell into pattern as I adorned the headset.The caller ID read; Mr.E.

&#x200B;

Thank you for holding Mr. E, this is Steven of Call4U how may we be of service. As cliche as it sounds, saying this for the umpteenth and last time, brought me to tears.A man cleared his voice on the other end.Do you want payback? Click; he hung up.&#x200B;

Back in my dingy studio apartment, my cat "Tipsy" was nestled into the lap of greying man.The cat plays with his braided beard, swatting at it with delight.The apartment complex resembled a motel, wallpaper tears and cockroaches included.As I keyed my door with an armful of groceries my landlord peered around the corner.&#x200B;

"You pay rent today?"She shouts a lot, likely due to being hard of hearing and bad at English."I uh..Tomorrow.." I hesitate, and decided to keep my lack of a job secret "was paid today, need time for bank.""You good people, very quiet, thank you."She grins, a whistle escaping from her missing teeth."I let handsome family man inside your room, you are welcome!"She walks off, shouting at the birds nestled in a nearby window.They flutter back as she rounds the corner.&#x200B;

I slowly open the door to my 300 square foot apartment.Tipsy lounges in the dimming sun of the single window."Welcome home!"The mystery man pulls the light string, illuminating my dinky closet of a room.I let out a girlish scream.&#x200B;

...

&#x200B;

We returned from a time long past, assimilating into my now spotless apartment.Time control allows any object or activity to speed up or slow down, including cleaning and cooking, which I found to be quite useful."You said we can do that once per day?"My curiosity was at an all time high this past week, having seen untold riches and witnessing historic events.Time travel was insane, but it seemed to have an effect on the veteran Mr. E. 

"Yes, but each traveler can jump only 365 times.Total.And that... that was my 364th."He looks sorrowful as he recognizes what is to come."If I do not pass the torch, then this gift will be forever lost."He presents the wand to me, "Why me?"I stammer."Why not you?"He locks his gaze with mine, and I begin to understand."You were meant to have this Steven.For better or for worse, I was drawn to you."&#x200B;

As I reach for the wand, whom my impromptu father figure calls the "Torch," tears strew down his face.This was a power he was destined to give, and today was the day.Upon grasping the wand, a surge of knowledge entered me, and I understood.When I regained consciousness he was gone.&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The first couple time trips I made were to be for practice, playing it safe.Still harboring a grudge for my former employer, Bart Kobold was to be my first 'victim.'I decided to go back in time and prevent him from getting HIS job, thus never having any power over me.Fool-proof.&#x200B;

Setting the time his LinkedIn profile said he had the job soundly in my mind; the torch was lit.I was soon standing in-front of an empty soon-to-be Call4U.Bart was begging at the feet of a brown suited business man.Blending in, I adorned a hard hat and find myself writing in my notepad, acting busy.From what I overheard, the project was months behind, and Bart was refusing to show the older man the rest of the building.&#x200B;

"Please Carl, the contractors said max two more months, that's all I need!"Bart pleaded."You've had too much time already, I'm axing this project."Carl pulls out a RAZR cellphone to make the final call."My wife is going to kill me, we're behind on our payments and our son is in the hospital!"Bart paces madly, barring entry into the unfinished sections.Feeling sorry for my former boss, I decide I'd rather help than hinder.With a flick of my wrist, the Torch enchants the building process.As if some grown man's version of Disney princess magic, the construction animatedly begins.The pilings pile, the concrete pours, and the foundation is set.Within seconds, the building blocks of my future office prison are finished.&#x200B;

As they enter, I exit.The reactions I overheard seemed akin to a home-makeover montage.He got the job....

&#x200B;

Being a time traveler can suck but only some "times."Everything happens as it should, we learn from our mistakes and as such our futures can burn far brighter.The torch is lit, allow it to illuminate the life ahead of you and shine on the past behind you....
