*Anna was asked on a date by Phil.Anna politely turned him down.*

I'd forgotten about him.It'd been nearly ten years.My last semester at my first high school before I moved to another state a month later.I vaguely remember his dejected face.He seemed nice enough, wasn't that bad looking either, but there was something about him that made me say no.I wonder what happened to him.At the bottom of the page, a reference number.I put my book to the side, and took a diversion to the shelf where Phil's book lay.I looked at the contents.I immediately spotted a chapter simply named 'Anna'.I flicked to it, and found myself halfway through the book.The beginning of the chapter seemed innocuous enough.Quite cute, even.Details on the first time he saw me, and how he was nervous to ask me out.*Phil asked Anna out on a date.Anna politely turned him down.*

The next page or two described his heartbreak.He was not just dejected as his face implied, he was completely crushed.I started to feel bad for him.I nearly put the book down, but continued reading hoping to see his happy ending.The chapter entitled 'Anna' kept going.*Phil followed Anna home.She did not spot him.*

My pity quickly turned to disgust.And yet, I continued reading.*Phil broke into Anna's home.He stole underwear, and placed cameras in her bedroom and bathroom.*

The chapter kept going and going.If "Phil watched" didn't precede nearly every sentence, it could easily be confused with my own biography.I felt sick to my stomach, but I kept reading.*Phil found out that Anna was moving away soon.He is distraught*

The next page was the last page of the book.
