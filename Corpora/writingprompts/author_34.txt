Just as Donald was about to press the button that would trigger the bomb - the bomb that would level the FCC headquarters - he heard a voice.Named for Donald Trump the First, Inaugurator of the Great American Monopoly, Donald had never heard English spoken with an accent anything like the one the voice carried:

"I'm gunna needya to put that trigga down mate."There was a distinct menace in the tone, and a confidence of someone who is usually obeyed.Donald hesitated, wondering if this was one of those illegal aliens people talked about from the time before the walls.People always said aliens talked funny, but few people in 2038 had heard one."I dinnea think he underrrstood ye" a second voice muttered, before a third voice exclaimed "Be a good chap and place the trigger on the bed.We won't kill you unless you refuse."Donald whirled around, expecting to see little grey men, or green sludge monsters.The sight that greeted him was significantly more perplexing.Three men, well dressed, well armed (at least Donald assumed the things they were pointing were weapons) and one of them carried something that Donald had never seen before - a smallish rectangular object which had moving pictures on the top face - the person holding it was jabbing at it and running his fingers across the images.The first voice spoke again - coming from the closest man, who waved his 'gun' to get Donald's attention."For the last time, put down tha bloomin' trigga!"As Donald slowly complied, he objected as non-threateningly as he could - "You don't know what you're doing!I've travelled here from 2038!Time travel - real genuine time travel!And do you know why?It's to stop the repeal of Net Neutrality!"A touch of desperation crept intonhia tone as he inched his had back toward the trigger mechanism."Aye laddie!We ken why you're here.We just can't let you do it!""But why?"Donald wailed "the internet is useless when you have to go through a paywall for each leg of every journey your data packets have to go through!Did you know that the top course at every major university is the state sponsored "Bachelor or Trumpian Communication Systems?"Any search that needs to be completed in under a week requires an advanced degree specialist!""Well here's the thing old chap" - voice number three again."You see, we come from 2038 as well.We represent the combined interests of the post industrial economies of our time, which is the rest of the world, give or take."Voice number 1 "As much as we admire the effort you and your little cadre of freedom fighters put in to get you here, there are many things you don't understand.30 November is celebrated all around the world as the day the internet was set free!"Donald's mouth hung open in disbelief.30 November was when it happened.When the arch nemeses of all free flowing communication forever plunged the light of the internet into the deepest darkest pit in the lowest circle of hell.Only freedom fighters as.dedicsted as Donald had a chance of fixing it!As Donald tried to explain, voice number one cut in again - "Nah mate!You've got it all wrong.Net Neutrality was never even a discussion outside of the USA.The day the FCC killed Net Neutrality in the US, dozens of countries around the world designated internet access an essential service, forever protecting the free flow of information."Voice number 3 - "He's quite right you know Donald.It took about two weeks for all of the major tech companies to really understand.Then one by one, they reconfigured their offshore disaster recovery solutions to become primary services, and moved operations to any of the countries waiting with open arms to welcome them.Amazon is based in Monaco now, Netflix moved to Scandinavia, Google went truly global and has a presence in every major city, 

Since no content could get oit of the States, media companies from around the world stepped up, globalised their offering and shut down connections to USA.Even primary DNS services move put of the USA."So no - you won't be killing Ajit today.Go home.When you get there, try to defect - swim 1 mile straight out to sea from this location and well pick you up in person.No one should have accept sub-standard internet.
