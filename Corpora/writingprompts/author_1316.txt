As her husband finished with a barely audible grunt, and heaved himself off of her, Brittany let out a long sigh."Well, that was a new record!5 thrusts, and we're done.", she thought to herself, glancing in disgust at her husband, who had miraculously already started snoring, sleep being the only thing that came quicker to him than ejaculation.As she reached for the now familiar nightstand drawer where she kept her "toy", thoughts of divorce were beginning to fly through her head."I can't keep living like this!", she told herself."I've been suffering through this complete lack of a sex life for years, and I **need** a real man to take care of me!""Wait, no no no no no!", exclaimed Brittany."I didn't mean need, I promise, it was a want, not a need, I've had this under control for so long!"Her pleas went unanswered.Gary, her old high school boyfriend, materialized and stood naked, erect, and confused in the middle of her bedroom.
