30 years.Its been 30 years not 27 like i have been hearing through the pipes the past few months.Always 30, jesus didnt anyone watch the first documentary about me, Eater of worlds and children?Outragious the mixups these fools get themselves into.The smell down here is different now, something less sinister and more invasive... Food?What fool without enticement from myself would bring food into my lair?One without fear i would assume.I'll soon change that.Through the sewers i creep, silently and unseen making only the most uncomfortable minor sounds as i feel they might arouse an uneasiness in my prey.The odor strengthens somehow piercing through the dank haze of old bones and raw sewage.I hear them now, not just one, perhaps three?No matter, I'll soon seperate them and bring forth their darkest fears.Green eyes, they haven't noticed me yet i can smell ones fear of rejection, aside from that a fear or not being able to protect loved ones, a hint of fear about not being accepted for their body, one smells only of anger and courage...These arent children... A lingering remembrance of a cage, a small cage, a rat!An enoumous rat!And turtles?Mutated large muscular turtles with arms at their sides.Disgusting, no fear i could drain from these... Monstrosities could ever quench the hunger of one such as me.Its only been 27 years anyway now that i think of it... Back to sleep for now, when i awaken perhapse I'll have a light snack of turtle fear with a side of rat before the feast of child flesh and fear...
