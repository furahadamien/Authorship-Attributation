I love you Pop-Pop, my granddaughter said as she held me.I looked deeply into her eyes and saw a composure that was way beyond her years.70 years had passed by way too soon and I had wrongly thought I would live forever.Its the kind of thing that just hadnt left me since childhood.I was the last real family she had and it felt like I was failing her.My time had run out just a bit too soon, but I knew somehow I would make it back here.My eyes opened on a place I hadnt seen in forever.I was sitting just as I had before it happened, staring at Snarlax.How was the trip? a voice from behind me asked.I have to get back, I screamed.There was this look of terror in their eyes, as if they were afraid of me.Give me more! I screamed almost as if I was in a rage.They backed away from me.I was the only family left for my granddaughter and I have to get back to her.
Youre who, an unidentifiable voice said to me.My granddaughter.She was holding me as I died.She cant become part of the system and an eventual statistic.I wont let it happen. I looked extremely angry.Listen, Snarlax said.What you see from the drug just isnt real.Its a hallucination.
No, Im going to get back no matter what it takes. I said with determination.Give me more of the drug! I said like I was crazy. 
No, he said.Listen, I dont like what it did to you.
I lunged at him claws bared and got a good swipe at him, before the others tackled me to the ground.I didnt realize how close to death he would come.I was charged later that day with attempted murder and that carried a 70 year sentence.That ended today and I have been released.All I could think about still was my granddaughter.Was she dead, did she become a statistic?All I knew was that I would never get to go back to that life.
