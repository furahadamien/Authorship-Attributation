Former president Barack Obama put down the receiver of the pay phone.What he
just heard was either the work of a single completely crazy person or ...He
didn't want to think about the part that came after the *or*.Whatever came
after the *or* was weirder than everything he seen in eight years in
Office.Barack turned to the Secret Service agent who waited at a safe distance.Safe
to not be able to overhear anything his charge had said, unsafe for anybody who
tried to harm said charge."Agent Higgins, I have to apologize for what will happen next.""Sir?""Please open the trunk.I need my bag."While the agent fetched the single black sports bag that occupied the luggage
compartment of the limousine, the former president patted his pockets.He
retrieved his keys, the phone and his wallet.Before Higgins could close the
lid, Barack dropped the items in the trunk."Thank you, Higgins," he said and took the bag.He turned back to the pay phone.After two steps, he stopped, removed his belt and
handed it to the agent.Barack dialed the number again.This was the third time and he had already
memorized it.Agent Higgins didn't see his charge disappearing.His line of sight was
blocked by the lid of the truck, or so his report claimed.He'd rather work
through financial files in a dark, lonely basement for the rest of his career
that to admit the person he was supposed to protect was sucked into the
receiver of a pay phone, at three a.m., in an empty parking lot in Olney, MD.* * * * *

"Call me John", a voice said, "Here, sit down."Barack was shoved into an armchair.The world began to spin."If he chucks, you clean it up, Johnny-Boy," said a raspy voice from the
other end of the room."How's the dizziness," John asked."What happened?""You have been teleported," John said."That's why we needed you to get rid of
all the metal on your person.""Where am I?Am I still on planet Earth?""What did you tell him, Johnny?You know, they don't like it when we tell them over
the phone," the man in the corner said.He sounded angry, and a little bit
scared."I told him what he needs to know to get here.Nothing more," JFK said."I told you, he's a clever one," he added."Pfff," was the only comment from the corner."Where am I," Barack insisted."New Mexico.""Roswell is in New Mexico.This is about aliens!""All in due time," John said."But yes, this is about aliens.Do you remember
everything from the Book?""Errm, yes.""Fine.Remember chapter thirteen?""Johnny!Remember the agreement.I'll do the talking, you'll do the chores,"
came the voice from the corner.For the first time, Barack could see the room clearly.He sat in an armchair.The chair was one of four items of furniture in an otherwise empty room.Two
identical armchairs and a small coffee table completed the arrangement.The
telephone through which he had arrived was the only piece of electronics.At
least, the only visible piece of electronics.JFK had sat down in the empty chair.The third one was occupied by a tall,
thin man.He seemed vaguely familiar to Barack, like a high-school buddy that
you meet in the restroom of a dive bar, two weeks before the twenty-fifth
reunion.Like in that situation, the silence continued.Like in that
situation, it became awkward."Do you know who I am," the man in the corner finally asked.Barack shook his head.To his surprise, the nausea was gone."You owe me five dollars if you don't say my name in the next few seconds.""Lincoln?Abraham Lincoln?That's impossible.You are dead.""The assassination made it all more believable.I didn't have the convenience
of a twenty-second amendment like you kid."A snort came from the direction of JFK."I meant, you must be over 200 years old now!""Ah, that.Sorry, it's easy to forget if you're as busy as I am.""How?How are you not dead?You haven't aged a day," Barack said."If I say, *alien technology*, is that sufficient?"Barack was silent for a moment, then nodded.Chapter thirteen had mentioned
advances in medicine.Among other things.Teleportation was mentioned too.That it involved communication equipment had been left out."Well, let me get to the point quickly.We are all busy here," Lincoln said."You have been chosen because you were deemed to be very capable during your
apprenticeship," he said."He means your presidency," JFK said."My presidency was an apprenticeship?For what job?""The one we're about to offer you, if either of you kids let me explain,"
Lincoln said."You mastered your three tests very well, the council decided.Against my
vote, kid, that you know it.Although I admit that healthcare reform of yours was a
noble cause.Anyway, the council has decided that you are fit for a real job."Obama was quiet.Lincoln noticed it and continued."We offer you another presidency, of course.There is a world that requires a
leader and you are that leader.If you accept, you can be in office tomorrow.""President of the World?I knew it!There is a secret government!"JFK sighed."A world, not the World, capital *W*.You have been trained to be
president of a planet called Smeyenope.It's somewhere in the constellation of
Cygnus, I believe.""Cygnus?Who are you guys?How can you do that," Barack asked."We're the Council of Presidents.We have been appointed by the Council of
Presidents, which in turn has been appointed the Council of Presidents.You'll get the differences later, when you will be asked to join the Council.For now, it is sufficient to know that temporal anomalies are not as puzzling
as they sounds right now.As to how: Earth has been created as a training planet
for all sorts of jobs.Presidents, policemen, bakers, scientists, and so on.""Training?This was all an exercise?I ordered the death of people!""Well," Lincoln said, "It was their test too.""Those who survived will fight for us in the War.As Abe said, we'll explain
that later.Right now, you have to choose if you want the job or not," John
said."What about my family?""We'll arrange everything.If they want to come, we'll relocate them.If not,
we take care of that too.Our android surrogates are quite convincing.They
will not notice the difference.Neither will you if you decide that you want
one for your wife.However, I was informed that the women of Smeyenope have
their own, very special charm," JFK said."What are my duties?What are my powers?""You govern.That's it.Ensure that the planet runs smoothly, that it fulfils
its trade obligations.Decide this, order that.Basically the same things you
did as POTUS, but with two differences: You don't have an army at your
disposal and you can't leave.For the next thousand years, Smeyenope is your
problem.Anything else is up to you.Be a dictator, be an advisor.The Council
doesn't care as long as the export quota is met.""A thousand years?"Lincoln nodded."After that, we'll see how you're doing."Barack was quiet for a moment.JFK regarded him, then said, "If you need time
..."

"No," Barack said and looked up, "I'm good.I'll do it."JFK smiled a little 'I told you so' smile in Lincoln's direction.He handed
Barack a slip of paper."Good.Take your bag and dial this number.It'll bring you to the Genetic
Adaption Facility in orbit around Smeyenope.""Genetic Adaption Facility?What do these aliens look like?""No idea," Lincoln said, "It's a water planet, that's all I know.""Water planet?You mean, I'll be president over a planet full of fish?""Unlikely," JFK said, "The most common pattern among sentient water species is
the squid.At least my people are."With a often-practised motion, JFK reached behind his back and pulled
something down.The sound of a zipper was audible.After a second, his skin
looked like it was loose.John shrugged like a man who took off a diving suit.Barack had to sit down again after Kennedy's skin dropped to the ground.The
purple skin was not the problem, nor the ten writhing tentacles.Neither was
the prospect of living underwater.The problem was, he didn't know how Michelle
would react.President of a planet.The most powerful man of the world for a thousand
years.There was no choice actually and the Council knew that when they had chosen him.After a second, Barack Obama began to dial.
