I was bleeding out in the middle of the street.It happened quite suddenly.I was just going back home after work and suddenly this man tries to rob me.He had noticed I had nothing of value to offer him.I wasn't carrying any money with me and wasn't wearing anything of value he could take.Next thing I noticed, was this knife in my chest as he stole my shoes an made a run for it.But, after a while, I started to feel lighter.No effort was spent while standing up.This felt weird.I stare at my chest in search of the knife.However, I find none.Furthermore, my body looks transparent.Then, a sudden thought crosses my mind.As I slowly turn around, I notice my actual body on the floor.I collapse to my knees and I try to touch it.Maybe this could be just an out-of-body experience that people go through when they're on the verge of death...right?"There's nothing more you can do.", a slow and deep voice called me out.I draw my attention to the direction of the voice and see a human figure that had his face and his whole body covered in in a grey robe."Please!You've got to take me back!My wife and children are waiting for me!""I'm sorry, but when someone dies, there is nothing to be done anymore.""But you're Death!Isn't there anything you can do?!""Despite what you may believe, I hold no power over the dead.I am just like you, just a wandering soul."I start feeling dizzy so I just sit down.This was just too much.How could I be dead?There was still so much I wanted to do!Watch my children grow up, finish my book, going on a world trip with my wife when we were both retired...I try to take another peek at my now dead body."I wouldn't stare at it, if I were you.It gets worse the longer you have contact with it"

"What do you mean?", I tried to be as polite as possible, but this supposed "Death" was getting on my nerves."The more a soul has contact with parts of his previous life the more rapidly it disintegrates.""I feel fine so far.Can't you just leave me be for now?", as I uttered this words, a small crack appeared in my hand."Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?""Alright, you win."I hesitantly start moving away from the place of my death.We walked around somewhere the end of the street, the body could barely be seen from here.As I stood against a wall, I realize something.He was still next to me."Don't you have other souls to guide?I can't be the only one who died.""I just help the souls I find.I can't be everywhere at the same time.Besides, don't you want to go to the afterlife?"The only thing that followed his question was silence.Afterlife sounded nice, for sure, but I felt like there was still so much left undone.I couldn't just go to the afterlife right away.Death turned at me and sighed."Being obsessed over your old life won't do you any good now.There's nothing more to do but to move on."I was starting to get annoyed,"What do you know?!It's not like I can just accept this this easily!""I was in your shoes once.Like I said, we are both drifting souls.And believe me, chaining yourself to your previous life like this, will only make you disappear.If that happens, you can kiss your afterlife goodbye."His words carried a heavy weight.Everything was too much of a mess right now...

"But, there has to be a way to go back right?Please, tell me there is!"It was his turn to remain silent.Nothing more needed to be said.Against all of my wishes, I start crying uncontrollably.I can't really say how long it lasted.Only that, when I was finally finished, the sun was already up and my old body was already being carried away.Death sit himself next to me."You know, I died in the middle of a hunt.", I comment nothing and stare at the ground while he talked,"Our tribe was growing hungry and we needed a lot of food.Fast.So, we tried to take a bigger prey than usual.We managed to kill the darned thing, but it collapsed over my person, crushing me instantly.""You hunted elephants?""No, no, no.This is way more back.It was a mammoth.""...How old are you exactly?""Don't really know how to count.But by my estimation... a lot.""Honestly, I'm surprised you can even speak my language.""When you meet so many people while you travel the world, you start catching on a few things."I look up in thought while staring at the now blue sky.My thoughts feel clearer, at the very least."Thanks.""So, ready to move on?", he stands up, patting his robe.Move on...It still is an appealing idea."Hey Death, do you mind if I delay that afterlife thing for a while?""For how long?""About a week or so.".....................................................................

"Are you sure about this?", he asked me."I am."We were both in tuxedos that Death got us god knows how and were walking towards our destination.Death was also wearing a fedora that was tilted in a way to cover his face.Guess I wouldn't get to know how he looked like.We start seeing a lot of cars parked along the street."We're close.""We can still turn back.It's not too late.""Well, this is my decision.My mind is already made up.You don't have to come if you don't want to."I could hear Death give a small chuckle,"Nobody should be left alone at their time to go.No matter in what way.""Suit yourself.", I answer while grinning a little bit by instinct.It didn't take long to arrive to that place, with its big iron gates."Haven't been to one in a long time.""Feels weird hearing Death say that, considering it's a cemetery.""Believe it or not, it is one of the places where I find less souls so it usually isn't worth coming here that much."We pass through the gates and, in the distance, we could see a funeral take place."Last chance.I can just guide you out of here right now if you want to.""I pass."I start walking towards it, with Death following.Lucky for them, there were two vacant seats at the furthest corner of the funeral.More ahead there was a picture of me and a coffin.The crack in my hand starts spreading.Thankfully, Death didn't seem to pay it any attention."I've known him since high school.He was quite the troublemaker and I had to bail him out on several occasions.But, in the end, he was still a good man who always put his family first.I have nothing but respect for him.I guess I can finally understand when they say that the good ones are the ones that go too soon."He stepped out of the podium."Feels weird...Watching your own funeral...", damn, it's getting harder to focus, my eyes are starting to get blurry."Is something wrong?""I might", I take a long breath before continuing,"need you to be my eyes now.""Oh, Jesus Christ!Hang on there!Look!Your wife is next!"I try to focus my vision to get as clear as a picture as I could.There was no mistaking that golden hair."I worked part-time at a restaurant when we met.At first, he always appeared with his friends at first, because he was scared of talking to me alone.", everybody laughed briefly,"But, after a while, he started to come in alone.And you

know what he always asked?A glass of water.I fell for his sorry attempts at trying to invite me out, as much as I'm embarrassed to admit.We had two great kids which I wouldn't trade for anything in the world.", one of my arms got loose and fell to the ground, and I could start feeling cracks appearing all over my body,"If there was one thing I regret doing, was not telling how much I loved him the day he went to work.So, if you're still out there, I just want to tell you that I loved you, so, so much!", I could start hearing her sob when she finished her speech.I couldn't feel any of my limbs anymore, but, even so, I used all of the strength I had left to say,"I love you too.", and my torso started disappearing.I could hear Death in the background."You know, after seeing the face of many souls going to the afterlife, I've got to admit, yours is one that appears the most peaceful."I briefly laugh at his statement, before the last traces of my soul got swiped away.
