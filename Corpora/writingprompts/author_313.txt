would you believe me?I once lived to be thirty-five.to be clear, thirty-five years and then I died.but was it here, my funeral, where no one cried?my biggest fear, my funeral, no one came to say goodbye.everyone so insincere, no ones in here, to even say "hi".not a even half a soul to remember this ass-a-hole, did I even die?Or worse yet, had I ever lived at all?my voice hoarse as I approach my own corpse
screaming hello!with a rasp of course.Am i dreaming, if so how will I know?how demeaning what is the meaning of such a small casket?perhaps something happened that was drastic my body was chopped up and wrapped in plastic and now stuffed into this large wooden basket I had another question but I could not bring myself to ask it.but I thought it anyway, did I get my ass kicked?If I was in a scuffle I wonder how long it lasted.I did not smell the stench of death they must have masked it.how did I get so off task?The thing I remember last was beginning a poem  with lines and rhyme that had some semblance of proper form but now it's torn.Blow the horn!I guess punctuation and meter have been tossed out the window.As the wind blows I try to remember the writing prompt.This train has derailed and this cigarette has been stomped.This is why I should never try to pursue writing....I guess I bit off more than I could chomp.write in your book of comp, another failure for you to flaunt.do what ever you want, sorry everyone for wasting your time and mine.Know this though and know it well.I told myself to write more even if it's not going so swell.so let it be known that I got up, no matter how many times I fell.sorry to drag you fine folks though this hell.I know the writing is shit, Im deaf, dumb and blind, nothing wrong with my sense of smell.

The number reads 5412.5412 approaches me and without a word and drapes his arm around my shoulder pulls out a phone and snaps a picture of the both of us.in the picture I see 5412 above the strangers head and 6001 above my own.The stranger finally speaks, "at last, I have a picture of my father.".without another word the stranger turns and walks into the night.
