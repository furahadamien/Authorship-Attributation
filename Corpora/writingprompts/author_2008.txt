I woke up in a panic, no idea where I was.I stood up and looked at the ground and I saw a corpse my corpse.I jumped back in horror, I saw my family crying over my mangled body, then it began to come back to me.While hunting I was attacked by a lion.I lost grip on my spear and tried as hard as I could but there was nothing I could do against the beast.I tried begging and pleading for my family and friends to be able to hear me.I screamed and I whimpered and everything in between but to no avail.I was surrounded and yet alone.I sat quietly as I watched my daughter lay next to me or rather my body.She was no longer crying, just a face of stone staring into my lifeless face.I am the first to die since we split off from our original pack, left to go find a better life, a life I would not get to live.I noticed a light.It was brighter than the sun.It made me feel happy, sad, anger and relief all at the same time.I felt as if I needed to walk towards it but I refused to leave my family, and so I ignored the calling light.I followed them for a year and a half.I watched my kids begin grow into adults earlier than they should have because they had no father.I watched my wife move on.He seemed like a good guy but I would be lying if I said I hadnt tried kicking him in the balls a few times.My daughter decided it was time to wash; they had been walking for days and decided to take a break at a river.She walked in and fell.There was a steep drop off that she could not see.I tried my best to save her.She couldnt swim, none of us could.I watched the life drift from her face as I tried to raise her out of the water but she would just faze through me at every attempt.Then she no longer struggled and drifted to the top of the water and then to the bank.I saw an all too familiar scene of mourning and sadness.Then I saw her raise up, just as I had done; only she didnt panic.She didnt cry, she only stared at her lifeless body.I tried to call her name but couldnt find the words.What if she still couldnt see me?What if I was still alone?Thats when she looked at me.And she began to weep.Quietly, almost as if to herself.I ran over and hugged her, only I didnt faze through.I felt her.And then I began to weep.I told her how I had followed them every day, watching over them.She said it must have been terrifying to go through alone and I admitted it was.She then noticed the light.I explained that it had been following me since I died, and since she died it has become even more intense.She asked why I hadnt gone through, to which I responded I couldnt leave them.She sat there a minute in deep thought, and told me we should go through it together.I agreed even though I didnt want to leave the rest of them.I could feel myself becoming weaker every day and losing more and more of my ethereal flesh.She grabbed my hand and said No one should take this walk alone. We began to walk towards the light, slowly I could feel strength coming back to me, I could feel a relief the light was giving me.Then I felt her hand drift away and felt a strong shove in my back, through the light.It was so bright, so intense.I opened my eyes but I could not see my daughter.I was confused.I yelled for her.I begged for her.I was alone again.Then another man came through.A man who had left with us.Then my wife.Then my brother.Slowly people continued to come through.I stopped recognizing people after a while but their story was always the same.It was that they were guided to the light, that Death took their hand and told them no one should take this walk alone.That Death took away their fear.They may call her Death, but I will always call her my daughter.
