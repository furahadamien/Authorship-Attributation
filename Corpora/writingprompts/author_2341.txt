TheGreatSlipper
Bo came to a stop in front of the small dome hut.It's rocky surface did not fool him though.While it did look like an ordinary desert dweller's home he knew to be cautious.As he appraoched he unwrapped the cloth protecting his face from the harsh desert winds.Carefully he knocked on the small wooden door.Bo put his hand to his hip, a small weapon sat ready in its holster.The Watcher had sent him to elimnate the inhabitant of this home, apparently he was quite old and knew too much about the city's corrupted origins.Although barbaric in origin, Bo agreed to the task.Bo jumped a little as someone had finally answered the door, the assumed target.He was certainly a sight to see.He had a terrible slouch and time had shrunken him to the size of a small sand worm.His skin sagged and dragged on the ground from his body, but his face was probably the most peculiar.His eyes were complete black and mostly hidden by a hard squint.His wrinkles made his face look like the texture of stone.He beckoned Bo into his domain.Bo took his hand off his weapon, he wanted to see where this went.Careful not to step on the little man, Bo found a comfortable place to stand.The old man however hopped up into a rocking chair seeming to be made from the white trees that once towered over the now barren desert."What brings you here, traveler?"The old man croaked with a smile that shifted his whole face."I-I've lost myself among this wasteland, I'm not from around here," Bo lied to the man."If your in need of directions I'm afraid I can't help with that," The old man said, "Once the storms had rolled in I have never left my home, I too am unaccustomed to the land."Bo's jaw almost dropped but he kept an understanding face.The Watcher informed him this man was older than what was thought humanly possible but if he lived through the storms of legend he was far past 500 years old.Sort of creeped out Bo unbuckled his canteen from his belt.While he promised he wouldn't drink until Thursday he drank anyways.The old man stopped rocking in his chair, his face grew serious."What are you drinking there young man?"The old man asked desparately.Bo stopped drinking and licked his lips.If Bo told the truth he might put himself in possible danger.The liquid was a precious resource throughout the land and this man looked mighty thirsty."W-water..." Bo said impulsively.The old man quickly waddled up and snatched the canteen from Bo's dry hands."No..." The old man breathed in disbelief, "surely there's no more..." His hands quivered in temptation but he shoved the canteen back into Bo."Get that away from me," The old man demanded.Bo did as he was told."How long have you been drinking water?"The old man asked."For as long as I can remember, sparingly."Bo answered the old man.The old man shook his head and sighed, his skin swayed with him."It's far too late for you, what a shame.You seem like a good man," The old man coughed out.He waddled over to a gagdet of his own creation, mixing sand and his own hair within it.As he turned a crank he glanced at Bo."How much did they pay you?"The old man asked calmly.Bo stepped back, surely he wasn't talking about The Watcher and Bo's task, right?"While physically I am weak, age has made my mind sharper than ever," The old man added."A few more gallons of water, that's what they're going to pay me," Bo gulped.He returned his hand to his weapon.The old man finished his mixture and poured into into another gadget, transporting that into the sunlight through a window.The mixture reacted to the light instantly and distilled into a smooth liquid.The old man picked it up and drank it.He then turned to Bo."Since I'm not already dead I believe your a good man to listen to reason.First, stop drinking water.Society still thinks we need that poison but after the first couple of thirst pains your body will adapt to live without water.If you stilk have pains there's other liquids that can ease the pain and won't poison you.Second, leave the desert, if you don't there's no hope humanity will survive any longer.Believe me when I say there's something past the desert, there nature is not the destructive force you think it is."The old man turns back to the window, "age has prevented me from traveling or I would have left this wasteland."Finally the old man beckons Bo to leave and continues staring out the window.Bo, for some reason he can not explain, shrugs off his task and exits the home.He glances back at the old man's hut.At first he thought the old man's words were nothing but drops of insanity but a feeling deep inside believed every word.Bo unbuckled his canteen and gave it a long hard look.He then chucked it into the wind that carried it away.Bo looked to the east, the same direction as the old man's window.That's where he was going.
