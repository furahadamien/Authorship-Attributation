The devil came crashin down
To a little Georgian town
Where only that Johnny guy
Made the devil die

After one fell swoop of pride
Poor Johnny couldn't hide
That he was the best
For putting the devil to rest

Boom!Crash!God appeared with a flash
Took out his 6-stringed guitar
And said "I'll turn you into tar!"The devil chuckled and layed back still
Knowing quite well of what was happening at the mill
Cause poor little Johnny boy
Was about to become God's toy
