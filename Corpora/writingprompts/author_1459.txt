DoYouWant_the_Cheese
I've outlasted it for years.I've watched campaigns come and go for years never having any effect on my habit, but this was something more.The first anti smoking ad I saw was when I was 10 years old.It showed a middle aged man going through his daily life with a hole in his throat.Plugging it when he took showers, talking like some demented robot, scaring his children.This had absolutely no affect on me.Science would take care of it, I thought.Robot voice could be fun, I hoped.But I will never be given the courtesy of robot voice, for the culture war against smoking has persisted.A few years after scary throat man, the government deployed a little more extreme measures to curb smoking, they began showing pictures of damaged lungs and arteries on the front of every pack of cigarettes.Every time you went for a smoke, you would be faced with the harsh reality of lung cancer.Again, this had absolutely no affect on me.I could always get a transplant couldn't I?Do lung transplants exist?It doesn't matter, the point is I just want to smoke my Marlboros.A few years later, the government again ramped up their efforts.This time, they encouraged citizens to heckle anyone they saw smoking.It was incredibly effective, the few people who could make it past robot voice man and pictures of fucked up lungs couldn't continue to smoke when it wasn't even cool.I mean it's one thing to knowingly destroy your body while looking badass, but to do it when people are booing you is just plain stupid.For a few a while it was just me and a group of angsty teenagers who liked the attention, but soon they passed the phase.Now the year is 2040, and I smoke alone.Every time I leave the house for a smoke I'm berated by every living person on Earth.Kids, old people, it doesn't matter.They've researched me, and they know just how to insult me.Every time I buy a pack , the picture that come with is no longer of damaged organs, but personal insults written by the cashier.This morning it said, "Your father is disappointed in you."But still I persist, I don't friends, family, personal relationships.Not when I have my Marlboros.
