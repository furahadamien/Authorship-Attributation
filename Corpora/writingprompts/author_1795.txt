He spent a long time sobbing heavily.His figure, curled on the couch with his head in his hands.His wailing, much like my own had been.Mom came downstairs, but didn't look at him.She stood and listened.Her own body was trembling in confusion over the genuine emotion.I made some hot cocoa, enough for the three of us."I'm glad you made it back."I said, feeling a bit uneasy.I'm sure it was noted.My tone of voice must have frightened my dad, because he quickly became defensive."I- This!Half an hour!"He couldn't put it into words anymore.The shock had made a nest in his heart.Mom bit her lip and let tears roll down her cheeks.In moments like this, her feelings could only be defined as such."Um...I just..." I couldn't meet their gaze.I was too ashamed."I thought you knew.""I thought I did too."Mom muttered, a bit of spite choking her intentions."I mean, not like metaphorically speaking.Or, literally.Like...Uh...The stuff."How was I supposed to describe it if they didn't understand it already?It wasn't like there was a word for it."The blinking."I finally said.It was the best I could come up with."What is!What blinking?"Mom was getting exasperated.Dad just sat in silent stare."Like...When you blink."I motioned towards my eyes."And..."

I thought of my trophies, my straight A's.My fashionable clothes and my social graces.My "good luck".Old soul indeed."And you're suddenly in college.And then you're not but you could have been.And... it's hard to remember but then you get headaches and suddenly you can be like anything as long as it happened.Or could happen?Um..."

I sipped at my cocoa, shame creeping up my face in red.My parents, even in this chaos, looked to me with concern and a desperation in their eyes.It was the same look when I had told them that I was bullied, and when I failed another math test.When they knew it was time to let me talk so they could understand.However, I struggled to imagine them understanding this.I hadn't tried before."I stayed here the longest though.I didn't blink for a long time.And...I went to Yale once, so that was cool!If you, if you focus and take some asprin the headaches will go away.And you can remember.Maybe not the first time, but the next time."I walked over to my dad.He was warm, and in my embrace he felt like the sound of a romantic waltz.He smelled of white and lace."Just think of when you want to go."I said, trying to give some instruction."And you'll blink and be there.Any time, even back."The house was silent.It was uncomfortable.I wanted to go see my grandchildren, but I figured I'd have to wait this time.
