"D'you hear?"Kira's mother Janna, whispered.Her shadow casted from the fire, dancing under the night sky.Kira lay hidden, peeking through the cracks of the poorly made tent from old tires and rusted metals.Kira could only see her mother's shadow casted on her dad face.The same face he made when there was trouble.Kira's instincts were correct  unfortunately.An early night was not usual."What could it be this time?"she thought."No food?Masters?Or worse, scavengers?"She grimaced at the thought of another scavenger encounter.She moved a little which caused a spark on her fingertips.She jerked from the surprise."No, no, not about Kira, we're you even listenin' to the neighbors Jorah?It's about the zombie boy."Janna says, lowering her voice even more.Kira perked up, recognizing the tale.The burning wood cracked, splitting the silence."they swear they saw 'im Jore.Scarred skin and all.From top to bottom they said.""That's all rats and bubbles y'know, tall tales and the like."Jorah interrupted.Janna scoffed."Tall tales?"She whispered menacingly."It's the end of the fucking world Jore.We're living in one sorry ass tale.I'm tellin you though, I believe 'im.""We got too much things to worry about love.I mean who knows whats out there.For as long as I can remember, we've been running from our masters."Jorah's eyes glossed from the returning nightmares.He quickly shakes it off."I'm sure they caught one and did shit to him."Jorah was frazzled.He rubs his face gently, trying to caress the problems away.He thought of the next few days.The caravan would have to move as soon as sunrise since they made a fire to survive the cold.They would need to hunt soon as well.To put the shitty cherry on top, Jorah noticed some guys eyeing his daughter.This warmed his blood."Our priority is Kira and ourselves.Did you see Lucian eyeing Kira.If that son of a bitch comes near us, I swear he'll be eyeing my shotgun."Kira knew about this Ofcourse.She was not stupid.In fact, she was smarter than most.She    has an eye for technology, driven by the curiosity of how it works.A few days ago, Kira found a small plastic rectangle, with a cracked glass screen.She knew that it was old technology and she wanted to tinker with it.Kira quietly crawled in her sleeping bag and took out the small machine, studying it.She was thinking.Imagining a hostile encounter with Lucian and how she would take the hidden knife tucked behind her shirt and stab the unsuspecting asshole.She smiled a little and drifted off to sleep."Doesn't it tickle your fancy a little?It's a boy covered in scars like leather, from top to bottom, naked as the moon, skin as red as blood, eyes yellow like an animal."Janna grinned, flailing her arms like a desperate preacher.Jorah laughs, feeling a little better."Maybe it's a master child.We never saw the masters bear children."He humours Janna.Janna taps her leg, gesturing for Jorah's tired head."Sleep tonight.I'll keep watch eh?"Jorah didn't mind that at all and rests his head on Janna, blanketed by the slowly dying fire.His wife smiles and continues telling the zombie boy story that they've heard many times.Jorah shuts his eyes.Jorah wakes from a faint shriek.He was covered by a sleeping bag.He could feel his wife's strong hands grabbing on to him.She shushed him."Scavengers."Janna says.Her voice sounded confident and alert.Jorah slowly uncovered his face then he turned to a prone position.He could see search lights in the nearby woods.Winter made it easier to see enemies but means it's also easy for them.Janna was also prone, covered in a black blanket behind some tall grass.To their right, about 5 meters away was 2 men, prone, gun at the ready and hidden as well.There were 5 other groups, spread out on the field, ready for the worst."Didn't realize they were so close."Kira crawls silently to her parents."D'you take down the tent?"Her mother asks with a commanding tone."I wouldn't have come if I didn't would I."she snaps back.Janna looks back at her and gives her one of those 'we'll talk about this later' look."They must've walked through the night, wouldn't have caught up to us otherwise."Jorah explains."Who got scavenged?"he added."Could've been them Dalik girls.They camped in the woods, thinking it was safer."Janna says."Pity.They were nice to us.""Shush love."Jorah flattens his body, telling his family with his eyes to do the same.Janna readies her rifle.Kira, her pistol.Search lights covered the field back and forth.Only thing they could see were tires, metal pieces, cold fire pits and random debris."See 'nytin mon?"A lanky man behind the other man with the flashlight says."No.Just a bunch of junk."He raises one hand, forming an O with his fingers and shines his light on it."For fucks sake, we only got enough for 2 days!I thought you said it was smokes galore?"A man with a deep voice calls from the woods.A group of voices cusses and groans."Shit, it's a whole clan."Jorah whispers.The other hidden families and groups readied their weapons.Faint crying can be heard nearby."Shut him up Gwyn."Janna calls their neighbour."I'm trying!"Gwyn replies with fear down her throat.Gwyn's 5 year old son, Scott was wrapped in a sleeping bag, hidden from sight.Gwyn assures him that it is okay.That he is safe.The two scavengers nearest to the field turn around, backs away from the families."Fuck it all, we've got two anyhow.The rest must've kept walking."the one with the lights say, a hint of sour in his voice."Well get 'im morrow.""You wouldve thunk they'd mass up you know.Like cattle."the other man smirks.They continue walking towards the woods, laughing and snorting."I admit it's a little fun when they run."one of them laughs.Kira was furios.She was friends with the Daliks'.Her brow furrowed and she tightened her pistol grip.One of the scavengers, while arguing with another, turns around pointing at the fire pits."Well they obviously left di'int they?"When he saw a pulsing light near one of firepits."Wait a sec, what's that?"He points at the soft green light."Why is he pointing at us?"Jorah panics.Janna looks behind and her eyes shot out of their sockets."Kira your damn pockets!"Kira looks down and finds a pulsing green light emanating from her pockets.She covers it."It's that weird machine I found!"Kira takes it out and puts it face down on the dirt."That's impossible."She thought."Why would it turn on like that!""Were fucked.At the ready folks."Janna aims.The scavengers yipped, loud and savage like.A bunch of them came out of the woods, guns loaded and bows drawn.They walk cautiously towards the now dead light."Mum, I'm sorry."Kira cries.Her hands shaking violently at the sight of the nearing scavengers."There must be at least 20 of them."Jorah's face screamed hopelessness."That's near double ours and that's including the younguns.What do we do Janna?""We kill or be killed.""But-" Janna interrupts him."Kill, or be killed love."Janna aims down her sights and shoots one scavenger perfectly between the eyes.The scavengers drop to a prone.Some are crouched.The rest of the group starts shooting at the scavengers.Bodies dropping.Some quietly, some screaming in agony.Once the enemies stopped panicking, they start shooting back.Gun shots riddled the entire field.Many families were killed almost instantaneously.They could now tell to aim for what looked like dirt mounds as gunfire provided lighting for both sides.Some scavengers charged at Janna.Jorah stopped them with his shotgun.Gutting them in one shot.Janna stayed focused.Not jarred from the terrifying screams.Headshot after headshot she made.Aiming exactly two inches above wherever there was gunfire.Then, a stray bullet hit Janna in the left shoulder."Fuck me."She clenched her teeth from the pain.She groaned and gave her rifle to Jorah."Keep shooting love."Jorah took the rifle and nodded.Janna painfully crawled backwards near Kira."Kira, listen closely, take our bag and get outta here."Janna explains, grabbing Kira by the arm.Her strong grip told Kira that there was no arguing."Mum.""Don't you dare.""Dad!"Jorah was not listening.But he could tell."I want to fight with you."Kira sobs.Lost in the situation and in denial."Kira do as I say, now!"Her mother screams."Or were all fuckin dead y'hear?"Kira's intent to kill never reached this point.Sorrounded by death and uncertainty, she could feel something hot and sharp forming inside her.She wished so badly for the enemies to just burn and disappear.She wished so badly to spend another time with her parents and to apologize to her mum for being an ass.She slammed her fists hard on the dirt and screamed from the bottom of her lungs.A flash so bright blinded Janna and Jorah.Immideately followed by scorching heat and what sounded like the loudest gun shot they've ever heard.Almost like thunder but near.Janna and Jorah quickly rolled away from the heat.The scavengers started shaking and screaming violently and dropped all at once.The gun shots immideately stopped and silence filled the air.Kira was passed out.Underneath her fists was burnt grass and dirt, extending towards the scavengers, zigzagging around her parents like veins under the skin.Up ahead, smoke rose from the burnt bodies.Some still had the glowing heat in them, slowly fading.
