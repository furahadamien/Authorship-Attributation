Dolkohm crouched on the gutter of the village inn's roof, standing perfectly illuminated by the inn-keeper's window.Many humans gave him a strange look as they passed by, but they were not his business tonight.There, across the street a dwarf named Branren exited the local dwarvish pub, briefly letting out a cacophony of roaring debauchery and indulgence.Dolkohm's eyes narrowed.The stocky, young dwarf stumbled towards the alley he overlooked.He had chosen his post at the darkest nearby alley wisely, for any normal dwarf would find light abhorrent.Dolkohm was no normal dwarf.He crept from window to window, staying illuminated as to avoid detection.Branren was mumbling a bar song about rubies and sapphires and tits as he undid his pants and began to piss on the inn's wall.Dolkohm had made this mistake before.He would wait until the ale-drowned dwarf was finished, lest he whirl about in surprise.And finish he did, with an unnecessarily loud and contented grunt.He was just buttoning up his trousers when Dolkohm landed behind him with a deep thud.When Branren turned he was greeted with a polished steel goblin mask."Branren"

The sodden dwarf turned to run but quickly stumbled and fell on the garbage strewn through the alley.He turned and gasped in horror as Dolkohm deftly avoided the trash.His swift and accurate movements did not match his dwarvish physique."Woh-wot do yur want mate?""Vengeance"

Branren threw some punches, but Dolkohm merely stepped out of the way.In between the drunk dwarf's lunges, Dolkohm jabbed at his sides until the inflictions caught up with Branren and he flopped onto his arse; breathing too hard for a 20 second fight."I tain't done nothin' mate.Yur got the wrong dwarf.""Last night outside that very pub, you nearly took the eye of Grenmund Flintsbane because he picked up a copper that you swore you 'saw first'.Am I wrong?""Moradin's hairy arse", Branren whispered "Yur a dwarf tain'tya?Too strong for a goblin.And too tall.'Tah sins of tonight are tah songs of t'morrow'?Umm... 'Ifa yur can drown a fight inna pint, it musta not beena strong swimmer'?!"Dolkohm stepped closer."Ugh, ana... 'an eye for an ale'?""It's an eye for an eye."Dolkohm drew a thin dagger and knelt to Branren's level."Mate I don't ev'n member that.Neither does Gren!We were just sharin a pint!I asked him bout his eye n' he laughed n' said he didn' hava clue!"Dolkohm gripped the desperate dwarf's throat as he brought the dagger close."You do not receive absolution from drowning your crimes in ale, creten" He gripped harder as he lined up the dagger."Dwarf violence will never stop if there is no punishment.Since there are never any witnesses, punishment must be doled out passively, in the shadows."Branren was blubbering, "B-b-buh, but.""Relax," Dolkohm gave a twisted smile, "tomorrow you won't even remember this."
