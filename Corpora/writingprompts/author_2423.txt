A peaceful morning.&#x200B;

That morning, like every morning, I woke up at precisely 5 seconds before 6:55am.That morning, like every morning, I stayed in bed, eyes opened, staring straight at the ceiling and waited for 5 seconds until my alarm started buzzing softly.I turned off the alarm, grabbed the glass of water next to my phone, and drank thristily, as I did every morning.I then put on my bathrobe, and carefully placed my phone in the right pocket.I felt a slight anxiety, as Gorgon detected the phone move and vibrated 5 times in my pocket, indicating maximum readiness.I crossed the room, my thoughts fixated on a single word: "Today".Today could be the last day of my life.Standing in front of the enormous window I softly said, like every morning: "House, open the drapes".The heavy dark drapes opened swiftly, silently.The sun poured into the bedroom, a warm cascade of light.The heat felt marvelous on my skin.As every morning, once my eyes had gotten used to the light, the view took my breath away: the bay and the gorgeous city spread below me, the trees of the estate surrounding House swaying softly in the breeze, the three large pools shining under the sun, the beautiful paths winding through the flower bushes.A picture of perfection.A picture of peace.For the past three years, except for brief trips to countries far and wide, my home.My own personal prison.My covent.My retreat.The HUD integrated in the panoramic window flashed "7:00 AM".As every morning, I was supposed to put on my sports clothes, climb to the roof, meditate and do yoga for half an hour or so before coming back down to take a shower and a light breakfast.But not this morning.This morning would be kill or be killed.There was a 98.2% chance they would strike before yoga, believing I would still be somewhat asleep in the early hours of the morning.They were wrong.There was also a 89% chance they would strike from three different directions at once.Suddenly, I felt alive, energized.The hunt was on.The HUD displayed "7:01 AM".I said: "House, open the window, please".This is also something I did every morning.I was keeping to the script.I needed them to believe they were going to catch me by surprise.The salty breeze poured into the bedroom, like the sun before it, feeling so fresh on my skin.The HUD displayed "7:02 AM".And right, under it, in bright red letters: "INCOMING".Gorgon vibrated in my pocket, a long angry signal.War.I saw her at that exact moment: an elongated flash of gold, a display of raw, unadulterated power.I thought: "Able to leap a building in a single bound".I carefully took three steps back, forcing my breath to stay calm, willing my heart to beat slowly, focusing on the air entering my body through the nose and exiting my lungs through the mouth.In a flash, she flew through the window, and landed right in front of me.LadyWolf.I caught my breath.She was God.Imagine a body as close to perfection as possible, clad in a thin uniform of blue and gold.Long red hair cascading down her back, all the way down to her upper thighs.Her masked face revealed nothing but eyes so green, and that famous lock of hair going down her left temple.I was in awe.Her entire body seemed clad in unstoppable limitless energy (and, according to my intel, that was pretty close to the truth).At that very moment, I wanted to be her, to touch her, to drag her to my bed and make love to her, to prostrate myself at her feet, wash them with my tears and confess my sins.All at the same time.And then she pointed a single finger at me and said, in a voice as sweet as the most beautiful angel, as harsh as the just GOD that she was: "Mastermind!Your reign of terror is over!".My legs turned to jelly, my mouth dry and parched.I was going to faint, to scream, to run, to hide.I did not have any chance, I was lost, as good as dead.Gorgon vibrated once.LadyWolf pulled back her hand in surprise, grabbed the side of her neck.A sharp intake of breath through her mask.It was too late.She collapsed gracefully, as gorgeous, irresistible, in death as she had been in life.I drew a long, ragged breath.Her body, its long legs slightly bent at the knees, a marble statue clad in gold and blue, her amazing hair an almost round sun on my bedroom floor.I knew that, invisible under her perfect hand, there was a single, microscopic, black dot on her neck.Five years.Five years, and ten times as many million dollars, to devise this: a silent, hypersonic projectile, able to pierce her perfect skin and inject the most poisonous compound known to man.The only thing able to kill beings from her home planet.In a quarter of a second, before her hand had even reached her neck, she was dead.I had no time to recuperate.Gorgon was, again vibrating like crazy.My second guest was there.My eyes shifted to the HUD.It still said "7:02 AM".Under the clock: "ALERT".
