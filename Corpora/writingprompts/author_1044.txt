Its been over ten years since I started seeing the lines.For the past year, my life had been going downhill.My parents suddenly couldn't seem to stand each other's presence, my school work was going to downhill, and my best friend had moved away about a month ago.For the first week or so, I just tried to ignore them and act like they didn't exist.No one else seemed to see the lines, and if I followed one for a few steps, it would start disappearing behind me.I thought I was going crazy, that it was just some weird hallucination brought on by the stress.Eventually though, the green line was pointing in a direction I was going anyways, so I followed it whether I wanted to or not.A few minutes later, while walking down a sidewalk outside of a ritzy apartment complex, I heard a cry of alarm from above.I looked up and without even realizing what was happening, caught what had to be one of the fattest cats I'd ever seen.Any other cat probably could have landed and been save, but this cat didn't seem like it would have survived the impact.As I was standing there somewhat stunned by what just happened, a harried looking woman ran out of the apartment building and nearly bowled me over.As she stopped to see if I was fine, she noticed the cat still in my arms and breathed a sigh of relief."Annabelle survived?Thank god, when I saw her roll out the window I thought  she was dead for sure!"Still not quite understanding what just happened, I stood there somewhat stunned as she took the cat and bustled back into the apartment complex.Over the next few weeks, I would find myself following the green line more and more.Every time something good would happen, either for me or for someone else because I was there.I must have saved the lives of two babies, at least one grandma, and a few dogs by the end of the first year.At the same time I was doing better in school, things were better at home, and life was generally great and getting better.Now, in my mid-twenties I must have saved over fifty human lives and over a hundred pets all while creating an amazing business, meeting the love of my life, and have a wonderful time.Recently though, it had started to get monotonous, and I had occasionally stopped following the green line for a change.While the red line had always been there, I had ignored it for the most part, mostly because it rarely went in the same direction as the green line did for more than a block or two.Today, with my husband away on a business trip and nothing important to do, I decided to follow the red line for the first time.Unlike with the green line, nothing seemed to come of it for a long time.Eventually I found myself in a fairly poor residential neighborhood where a number of kids were playing in the street.The red line lead directly up to one of the kids, a scrawny little girl sitting on the curb watching the others play.I stood in there in confusion for a minute before I noticed the red line had started to fade, and I could barely see it anymore.I looked around in confusion, trying to find the green, only to find it gone from my sight for the first time in a decade.My panic started to mount when I noticed that the girl had begun to look around in confusion as well.Something about the way she was looking around seemed vaguely familiar.Suddenly it hit me, she was looking back and forth at two paths, almost like she was looking at two lines.The lines that I could no longer see.The lines I had somehow handed off to someone who needed them more than me.
