I wake up very uncomfortable, and look around for my phone.And where did I keep those damn glasses?Instead of a pillow, I feel a rough surface beneath me...I squint and the patterns start to make themselves visible.I realize its some sort of... animal fur?So thats what that smell is.I spring up in revulsion, but the smell lingers.In fact, it clings to every part of me because the smell IS me.What the heck is going on?Im completely disoriented, but theres something vaguely familiar about all of this.Like from a past life...But that cant be.This must be the dream, and I need to wake up in my reality once more!I shut my eyes, pinch myself, to no avail.Whatever this is, it isnt a dream.I look around to find a few other sleeping forms in what appears to be some sort of dwelling.Its too dark and my eyes have yet to adjust.The inside of my mouth feels terrible, and I dont want to think if its ever been cleaned before.I move toward the light coming from one side of the dwelling, careful not to wake the others.Outside it appears to be night, but there is a lingering brightness from the moon and stars, and someone has lit a fire.A few.... cavemen?What the actual... yes, those are definitely cavemen!They are sitting around this fire, facing away as though they are keeping watch.They bare their teeth at me in greeting, but apparently notice something off about me because their welcome turns to concern.I take a step out of this strange sleeping place, letting the thick cloth swing closed behind me, and greet them with a similar smile.Do they speak?What in the world is happening?But confused as I am, I cant help but wonder: why does it all seem so... familiar?
