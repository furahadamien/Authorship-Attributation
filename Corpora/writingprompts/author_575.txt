I walk over to the fire place and pick up the ** #1 Dad**!mug I got my Dad for Father's Day years ago.Every day I look at that mug, to spark creativity.As an aspiring artist, I've been sculpting for nearly a decade!I'm 17 now, and have a lot of experience.But looking at this mug always reminds me that creativity won't help you by itself, because art involves practice, practice, practice.This mug, from art class when I was in first grade, proves that I have come along way from a leaking, sagging, pinch-sculpted mug with no handle.I set the cup back down, and tell my Dad I'm borrowing his truck to go to the store.I get in the new red Toyota Tacoma, and go to Walmart.It's the cheapest place to get clay of, errr, ok quality.Alright, it's horrible, but I go through too much clay to sink all my money into something from an art store.I walk to the art supply section, and pass a fathers day themed stand, full of mugs.They all say ** # Dad**.That must be a defect.Why wouldn't they include a number?I pick up my art supplies and head to the check out.In front of me in line, a man is purchasing one of the defective mugs.The clerk scans it and asks if he wants a bag.He says "No" and swipes his Visa.The clerk hands it to him, and he walks away.I notice the mug now says ** #47,981,315 Dad**!I immediately rub my eyes, thinking there must be something in them.I look again, but nothing's changed.The bright white mug has the same thing printed across the mug in thick black letters.I pay for my clay and head out to the truck.Not sure what just happened, I try to brush it off and forget by turning on the radio.The first thing I hear on the talk radio channel currently on is ** A weird phenomenon has many people confused.Unexplainably, all mugs that say #1 Dad, have had the number one replace.That's right folks, all #1 Dad mugs now state fathers' actual rankings among the other Dads of the world.This goes for ones purchased or made now, or in the past.This Father's Day, you may want to stay clear of a gift like this, unless you have a really great Dad.Back to you Bob.** I quickly slam the radio button off.That's freaky, but what is more worrying is that my first sculpted mug, may be ruined.Surely my Dad will not want a mug that puts him behind millions of fathers!I mean, I have a great Dad, but no father wants that.I get back in the house, and go to remove the mug from the fireplace mantle.It still says it.** #1 Dad**!I have ** thee** #1 Dad!
