Bang!Bang!"A life well lived" I thought as I collapsed to the ground.Everything was made slow and it sounded like Gospel.I gasped for air, not out of fear but out of habit.My entire life I felt dead, supressed, and now I finally get to compare it to the real thing.My partner rushed to my side and I took this opportunity to say my final words."Buddy!Buddy, you're gonna make it through this.""Heh, sorry kid.But I'd take this over a heart attack any day of the week.""No!No.You're gonna make it through this, look me in the eye and tell me you're gonna make it through this.""I can't tell a lie.He got me good this time.""No, Buddy come o-"

"Jackson, I ain't got much time left, kid.Listen to me.Carefully.I left you a couple thousand in the safe behind the big painting.I want you to take it and then I want you to get out of the Country.""No no no, man, we promised we'd get out of here together.""This old Reprobate promised many things, kid.But in a way, we are getting out of here together.""Stop.Knock it off.There's a doctor nearby you're gonna make it.""No.If I'm going I want it to be on my terms.I want you to take my horse, my bandana, my hat, and my gun.""I c-"

"Yes you-," the throbbing grew more intense."Yes you can."The sounds of horses grew louder, I glanced in the direction of our soon to be old home.I looked at the Sheriff who now has a bullet in his forehead.I looked at the dust cloud getting bigger and bigger, and shouting getting louder and louder."It's now or never, kid.Get outta my sight."Jackson ran off towards the base.He made himself scarce, just before he went inside to grab the money he turned around and spoke our Oath one last time."We may be Guilty..."

"...But we fight for the innocent..."

"... We may be fighters..."

"...But we fight for the pacifists..."

"...We may be Sinners..."

"...But we fight for the Saints..."

"... We may be dead..."

"...But we fight for the living."Those were the last words to leave my lips.The dust cloud disappeared and so did Jackson.Everything was black and white.The pain was unbearable.I somehow managed to get back on my knees, but at that very moment the Cavalry rose above the hill.I took the Sheriff's gun as well as aim.Bang!Bang!Bang!Bang!*Reload* Bang!Bang!Bang!Bang!Ba-

The music cut out and everything was dark.There was nothing.I couldn't see.Couldn't feel.Couldn't even breath.However something told me that I didn't really need to.I saw a small light, but opposed to the bright ball of light that they talk about, it was a vertical line.Nonetheless, I approached it.The closer and closer I got, the more curious I grew.I reached the wall of light and studied it.After a minute of pure bewilderment, I took a deep breath and pushed forward.Applause erupted so unbelievably loud that it made my ears ring.I looked at myself, my trademark brown duster was replaced with a suit, my black, messy hair was now properly gelled, and the holes that were previously in my ribs were gone.I walked across the Red Carpet that was at my feet and I noticed something rather peculiar.Everybody around me shared my face and there was a gigantic screen in front of all of us.As confusion grew the carpet shortened, I took my seat where a Red Velvet chair proudly stated my name: *Buddy Felter*.I looked at my Doppleganger to the left of me.The only variation between the two of us is the fact that he was wearing circular little glasses and his stubble was gone."Hey, Partner."He cut me off, "If you're wondering what's going on all will be explained in a matter of minutes.Just give these Gentleman some time to prepare."His voice was different too.He sounded more formal.More educated.I respected his word and sat in utter curiosity until a man with a white beard got on stage."Wasn't that incredible Folks!You can't resist a good Western!Everybody give another round of applause to Buddy Felter in his life film, Deadeye!"After the applause died down I took my seat again and the host cleared his throat."The next Life we will be watching today is  called, Countdown.The inspirational life of reincarnation 334, or Ace King.The man born to be an Astronaut.Once again, I am your host.The life will begin in just a few moments.Enjoy!"The man made his away over to me."Greetings Mr. Felter.I know you have a lot of questions.Feel free to as-"

"Yeah, Howdy.Um, I think I just got one: What the undying hell is going on?""Yeah that's normally the first question the reincarnations ask.Alright, so you see everybody around you?They're all you.Do you believe in Reincarnation, sir?Well if you didn't you should now.What we are doing, and what we have just done with you was watch your life go down.Every second of it.""Every second?""Absolutely everything.""Even-"

"Yes...Even that.So anyway, this is where you'll stay for all of existence.Don't worry, I know it sounds long.It really isn't, took a few millennia last time and you reincarnations didn't even have to suffer through it all.The show will be starting soon so please enjoy.I'm your host, God, call one of my Angels if you need any snacks or refreshments."I sat back.Bewildered.This seemed truly unbelievable.I left everything.My home.My world.Jackson.All gone.All for tickets to the cinema.And I didn't even get front row.This was my life now.I looked around at the reincarnations.The longer I seemed to stare the more different they looked.The 3 2 1 countdown on the Life ended and the movie began."It's a beautiful baby boy Mrs. And Mr.King.""He's beautiful.""Hey there little guy... Honey he's gonna be something great one day.I just know it.He'll be up there with the stars."I straightened my bowtie, I ordered a bag of popcorn, and I dared not take my eyes off the screen.My story's over.But not mine.
