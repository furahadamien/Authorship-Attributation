*"Please!"* She begged, tears in her eyes as her focus shifted between the man before her and the knife in his hand.For a dying and overcrowded world, that particular street was shockingly vacant and poorly lit.She sat in a heap at his feet, her hands and knees littered with shallow cuts, gravel-rash.The man flinched at the pain in her voice, even as the dagger urged him on.It didn't matter how many times he heard people beg, heard and smelt and felt their fear, it still haunted him.Even so, there was a soul in front of him that needed to be saved and he would be the one to save her.\~\~\~\~\~\~

*Serial killer* that's how they referred to him.He scoffed.He'd had a good run, saved as many as he could.He was tired but there was more work to be done.Law enforcement approached him steadily, surrounding him and yelling.So much yelling.He'd managed to save two, but a dozen officers was too much.One last life and his job would be done.A shot rang out, not the first to bite at him that night but the last.The redemptive knife slid home and his world darkened to black.He had just enough time to fleetingly worry that he'd been wrong about the knife's ability to send it's victims to a healthy, living world.The man jolted awake to the raucous cheering of *so many people*.The first thing he saw was a row of stone statues, looming over him, wreathed in flowers.Curiously, one appeared to look like him.As his mind cleared the last of its sleepy fog, he sat up and noted the joyous crowd hollering and watching him eagerly.The crowd swept him up into a celebration.*Hero*.The air was lighter, the water cleaner and the food plentiful.His relief was almost tangible when he realized he had joined the people he'd saved.A new world, so similar to the one they'd been born into, only this one wasn't doomed.The people could live here in peace.One person lingered at the fringes of the festival, eventually curiosity got the better of him and he approached.*Please!* The begging rang clear through his mind."Are you going to join in?"He inquired, gesturing to the exuberant party.The young woman's face twisted into a vicious scowl as he regarded her."How dare you save me."
