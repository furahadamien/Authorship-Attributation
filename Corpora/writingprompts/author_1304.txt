Charles let out a small smirk, glancing at his almost teary eyed opponent.Well he wasn't crying, or even closed to teary eyed, but Charles knew that on the inside, his opponent was in utter shambles.After a grueling 4 hour match, he had finally figured out the move that would lead to his eventual victory, the simple, yet elegant, Qd3.And by the looks of the opponent, he had come to this realization as well.Charles was a few moves away from becoming the Chess World Champion, a goal he had aspired for since his youth.The grin on his face becoming wider, he moved his hands towards the Black Queen piece in front of him.The moment he touched the piece, however, he started to feel the sensation he dreaded oh so much."Oh, for fucks sake, not now," he thought to himself, the panic rising."Please, what did I ever do to deserve this.I mean I know torrenting that one Teletubbies Epi-," and before his thought was finished, he vanished from the stage, just like that, leaving his opponent, and the audience, bewildered.Moments after he left the stage, he started to materialize in an all too familiar room, surrounded with a bunch of kids and their parents.Everyone gazed in awe, some mouths gaping wide open, as they saw the fully suited up Charles pop into existence, seemingly out of nowhere.Little Johnny tugged at his mom's collar, "Mommy, is that what they call a real magician?"Naturally, Johnny's mom was too awestruck to respond, her eyes fixated on the rather dashing Charles.Charles body started to heat up, and he was blushing wildly, "Uh, hello everyone.I assure you, this is not what it looks like."He started to scan the room quickly, and saw Lana standing in front of the sliding door that lead out.Making his way briskly towards her, brushing past the crowd of startled parents and kids, he gently grabbed her by the shoulder, and took her outside.But not before giving his best fake smile to everyone inside, "Ladies and Gentlemen, that has been the surprise act for the day, please enjoy the rest of the show.Making a swift motion with his hands, he bowed down, his toupee falling off and falling right into his hands."And yet, another part of the act, the disappearing hair act," Charles lamented, gritting his teeth together, knowing what he said made absolutely no sense.He heard a few laughs from the parents and kids alike, before shutting the door behind him.While adjusting his toupee, he glared at Lana, who was shifting her feet uncomfortably, staring at the grass surface beneath her newly bought red Nike Shoes, complimenting her freshly dyed Scarlet Red hair."My God, woman, what is it now?I don't see a single thing that could be possibly be wrong," Charles bellowed, his arms flailing wildly, "Do you realize where I was before this?"With a loud stomp of his foot, he continued his onslaught of words, "I was this close," his index and thumb finger a hairs width apart, "This fucking close to winning the World Chess Cham-" 

"I, uh, need help with this new game I'm playing," Lana muttered, bringing her iPhone up to Charles' face."What.""I can't progress, and I'm really frustrated because this one player keeps kicking my ass."Charles jaw dropped, and using every last bit of his remaining energy from collapsing, he whispered, "...The Legend 27?"
