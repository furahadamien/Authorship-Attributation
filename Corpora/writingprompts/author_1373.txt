The famous white light appeared to my eyes.I began to lose my grip on my hospital bed.It felt like I was falling.Voices from the light slowly rose in volume and I came to understand them as the light became brighter."Hey, you okay man?"One voice asked with a voice as soft as an angel."Man, it must have been a while, huh?"I don't understand.Wha- What's happening?In the corner of my eye, I could still see my nurse, but as time slowly moved, figures shaped.Not human, for sure."Where am I going?"I asked in fear."Is this what heaven is supposed to be?"A second voice came with a lot more rasp, "Heaven?Ha!This guy is coming up!Must have been some trip!""What?!"I exclaimed.Suddenly, as if I rushed through space, I sat up.Blue grass covering the hillside.Three moons followed each other across the sky.The stars glistening, sprinkling the black sky.A lake blanketing my view as I turned right.Behind me were the figures that arrived to me at the light."Hey Jaz!Xal is back!"The second voice shouted."Xal?...Me.Jaz?...My girlfriend.And him.He's Fei."I whispered.It was coming back.Us three decided to take the night off studying to relax.Fei brought a bong and then I knocked out."Must have been a good trip, Xal!You were out cold!"Jaz said as she welcomed me back to reality."Yeah.It was crazy.I lived through a whole life.Like from as an infant to an old man.It felt real the whole time though.I was actually scared to come back," I explained."Damn!Those trips are the hardest!After I got mine, it changed my whole view on reality!"Said Fei

"Okay, now okay.Come on we have to go back to the apartment.Our exam is in a few days and I still need to help Xal with the last few chapters," Jax said like the mom she acts like.We flew into our vehicle, Fei less eloquently than Jaz and I, and we rode off back to the city.
