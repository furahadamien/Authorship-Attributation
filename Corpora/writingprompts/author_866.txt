"Jesus take the wheel, Satan get behind me, Buddha... man the .50 cal" 

We had failed.The beast had acquired the last of the gems and had begun its transformation.We watched over our shoulders in a sprint,  as its unnaturally-orange, wrinkled skin rippled and expanded, tearing through its ill-fitting suit and smashing the podium before it to nothing more than kindling.It's dull, lifeless eyes darkened, dribbling fiery tears of joy as it cackled, and a headdress of horns arouse from its skull, piercing the beret of swooping hair it wore, like stalagmites from a barren, inhospitable cavern.It grew in size as our team neared the armored Humvee, the military personnel standing jaws agape, paralyzed in terrible awe.It's mass increased, smashing through the White House portico as we reached the vehicle.Jesus jumped into the driver's seat as the original unit collapsed to the ground, bleeding profusely through their eyes.He nodded, a wave of calm washing over me.Buddha climbed up the .50 cal and prepped it, robes billowing in the hot air emanating by the bloating titan, serenity despite the carnage and screams from the immolated press crew.Satan had my six, something that made the hairs on my neck stand on edge.Useful, no doubt, but no one was ever quite sure where he stood.And I...I jumped in next to Jesus.We had been summoned to return, uniting, reconciling in the face of a universal threat and over the past six months had formed an alliance of begrudging respect and, perhaps, friendship.Our missions took us around the globe, against awful odds, where everything always hung on a knife's edge.But when miracle workers are concerned, a knife's edge is as broad as the Arabian desert.And yet, we were losing.The Beast now towered over the surrounding city, stomping through the remains of the White House, bellowing "MAGA MAGA MAGA" incomprehensibly, in a rage that its hands were now too big to access Twitter.Jesus drove us toward the Beast, screaming "Not in my name!"while Buddha opened fire, bullets thudding into the Beast's clementine hide."Four things cannot be long hidden," his voice cut through the din, "the sun, the moon, truth...and my vengeance."The Beast shrieked, "Unfair.Losers.Whattabout Hillary?"It swung at the vehicle and missed by feet, its fist rending the earth, sending chunks of immaculately manicured grass into the windshield.Jesus spun the wheel and the Humvee turned around, Buddha's fire never ceasing.Satan stood next to him, manhood in his hands, peeing and laughing at the Beast, which only served to enrage it more.The Beast stomped after us, the Humvee's engine straining as Jesus floored it, eyes on the rearview.We cut through the Ellipse and across Constitution, swerving around flaming wrecks that used to be cars.Buddha ran out of bullets.Satan ran out of urine.I gathered my strength.As we reached the Washington Monument, it seemed like all hope was failing.The Beast was growing stronger, not weaker, gathering the souls of its followers from around it, its foot was now the size of our vehicle.Thankfully, the Beast stopped to compare its appendages to the erect monument but the reprieve was temporary.I was not ready yet.We continued south, but we were rapidly running out of time...and land."Don't worry,"Jesus said with a wink, "I got this."Buddha's eyes widened as we reached the Tidal Basin.Satan rolled his eyes and muttered "Not this again..." Jesus never took his foot off the accelerator and we bombed straight onto the water, never sinking, skipping across the surface like a stone on a pond, until we reached the other side, screeching to a halt."We need to do something...all those people," Jesus said, tears in his eyes."We must look within,"Buddha said, though truth be told, it wasn't very helpful."We must look to ourselves.Hit the gas for Chr....your sake,"Satan said in predictable selfishness."No," I said, "The time for running is at an end."The Beast stepped out in the Basin, dying the water a sickly tangerine color, fish bubbling to the surface.The Beast was salivating acid, interspersed with ravings about "the best" and "greatest," smashing an in-bound Qatar airways flight with glee.And then, I was ready.From the distance, it was only a small brown speck, growing larger by the second.In a moment, you could see the white top and then the timber line.I grinned.The Beast scratched its hairpiece in confusion."The mountain has come to Mohammed."I shouted and directed it with all of my will.The millions of ton of rock, ore, and soil loomed above the Beast, casting it back into shadow, and then fell, with a sickening, though satisfying smoosh, like the sound of a scorpion smashed under heel."Fake NEWS!"The Beast bellowed and then expired.
