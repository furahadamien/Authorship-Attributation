Success and happiness....some say those things come hand in hand.In my case they do all my life I have followed the rules of society and it has paid off in a big way.I went to college, graduated, and then began my career which paid me real well.I even met my fiance from my work.As a 25 year old with my health, career and social life intact I have been ahead of the curb and it was all thanks to me following the green line that appeared when I became a teenager.You see in my society when a person reaches a certain age they see a green and red line.Once a you see this you are not considered a child  any longer as you must make the decision to follow the one of the paths for your by these lines.In my society the green line has been set up to guarantee success and happiness.The red line on the other hand, well the red line guarantees nothing of that sort.You must think with these 2 options it would be easy to choose the green line, and it is for a majority of people in my society.But for a few they are very tempted to take the red line, as they get off on the excitement of the unknown.Unfortunately those that have taken the red line have almost always regretted it according to what my parents, teachers, and friends told me all through my life, making sure I would choose wisely and pick the green line.It also helped to see what happened to friend Darren.Darren was the kid who would always question everything and everyone.He was the kid that would get himself into trouble doing things he was not suppose to do.However he was a kind person with the flaw of finding himself in tough situations far before the red line.Maybe cause his parents had followed the line and he came from a broken home.All these things in Darren's young life led him to jump right on the path of the red line.We lost touch as we grew up and last I heard he was a drug addict with quite the criminal wrap sheet.However the curiosity of the red line has always been with me.I was suspicious as to why so many people, especially ones I looked up to told me the red line was bad considering they themselves have always followed the greened line.I would tell myself that Darren was a failure because of circumstances before seeing the green or red line.Up until this point my life been perfect and I am happy, why would I screw that up?One day as I was leaving the office I made the split second decision to make the jump and see where the red line led me too.At first when it diverged from the green line I drove through a part of town that I never had been through before.Many abandoned homes, and poverty was rampant in this area.None the less I continued to follow the red line.Eventually I realized the red lined re-merged with the green line and it lead my back to my home where my beautiful fiance was.As I pulled up to my garage I sat there laughing hysterically, thinking all this time my curiosity was about that red line but it led me back to where I am.As I awoke to go to work the next day I pretty much had forgotten all about my curiosity of the red line since nothing different happened....or so I thought.As I went into work the CEO of my company set up a meeting and blind sided half of the company by announcing they would have to layoff half the employees including myself.I was devastated.My career/job was my identity.I felt crushed, and so I made my way back home.As I went home and told my fiance the news, something changed in her demeanor.She went from a supportive loving partner whom I thought would be understanding to showing a real nasty side of her.She was more upset of what her friends and family would think now that I lost my job.She was upset she couldn't have the standard living we became accustomed to having.I tried to calm her down telling her I would find another job that pays well but in her eyes I was a failure.And deep down I knew I was a failure as well since I had never failed at anything in my life.Over the next few weeks I was around the house more and began to see things in my fiance that made here really really ugly to me.Like the way she reacted to the news of my layoff, the way she would expect me to do everything for here, how she talked down on me.I realized she had always been this way to me but I was engulfed with my own success and what I thought was happiness that I chose to overlook these negative qualities of hers.I also realized while interviewing for a new job in my field that I really didn't like the type of work I did for a living.Sure it paid well but it was not the type of job I could longer see myself doing another 30 years.Then it hit me like a ton of bricks, I came to realize that on that day,  where I decided to follow the red line my life did shift.All this time I was expecting the path to take me on a different route physically, however it was actually a shift in things in my current life.I realized that even though I still see the red and green lines, that the further I looked unlike the other times, the lines don't diverged and that they run parallel together as far as the eye can see.As the months went by my fiance left me, I couldn't get rehired in my field of work as if potential employers sensed there was no passion behind my words during interviews, resulting in my becoming homeless.It was a living hell and I had regretted taking the red line.I thought there was no way out it.Living in my car, depressed and feeling hopeless I started to have suicidal thoughts.These thoughts got the best of me and I was ready to go through with it until I ran into an old friend.Yes it was Darren!It was a bitter sweet reunion because I was at my lowest point and somehow Darren looked very happy and content with his life.As I spoke with him he said he was also at the point of hopelessness many times after failing at the simple things in life.However the one thing he said that helped him the most was he never accepted failure and no matter hopeless he was, he never saw taking his life as an option.Old successful, happy me would have viewed Darren as beneath me had I ran into him, since he wasn't financially well off and was single himself with no family.But what I noticed Darren had was that he was happy, genuinely happy.No matter how hard life hit Darren he learned to callous his brain, to be mentally tougher and find his own solitude by helping himself.He told me that the red line is what helped him gain this perspective in life.He had no regrets taking the red line because the path of the unknown brought him many happy times as well as unhappy ones.He said the green line is a social construct of our society telling us what success and happiness is.Those two things are subjective to the individual, that only once we experience the other side of feeling unsuccessful or being unhappy is when we truly know what being successful and happy really is.After he told me that I started to change my perspective on things.Realizing that as bad as things were, my mind and life were actually freer than ever on the red path as I could experience the wide possibilities life has to offer.And from that point forward the good times I have had have made me realize what true happiness feels like since I could compare it to the bad times I have had.I have also grown to be more compassionate, empathetic and non judgmental towards other people who I would previously look at with pity and disgust.In hind-site I realized that I was never really successful and happy following the green line, but rather I was following a heard mentality and  my happiness was actually arrogance and stubborness to see things for the way they really were
