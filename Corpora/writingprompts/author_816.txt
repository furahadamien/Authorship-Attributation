There was a saying that came to mind as You approached.Hell hath no fury like that of a  scorn woman.It was one of those sentences you hear over and over and never really grasp the meaning of until you manage to get someone you love dearly irritated with you.And it might just so happen that she hits you with a frying pan, with enough force to crack open the skull.What can sobs of regret do against what's soon to be a body, lying in the asphalt, some hair she mistook for that "Cheating skank", which belongs to your dog, Goldy, still in her hand?It's no surprise  You ended up in hell.After all, through your lack of grooming, of personal hygiene, and through your carelesness you convicted her not only to the shackles of prision, but to the shackles of personal guilt.To be forever haunted.Perhaps one day might she apologise in hell, as killers are one to do.It's not that bad really.You had been expecting the whole charade, lakes of fire and sulfur, but it's actually relatively good.Of course it helps that they can't hurt you in any way.For it is not through psychical torture that hell operates, but through the breaking of the mind.You are placed in this pods, very futuristic that show you your biggest regrets.It's supposed to show you your wrongs and torture you with every single wrong thing you did, but turns out putting aristoteles, for paganism, as well as Tesla, for being batshit crazy in the same room of pods, and they manage to turn the system around.Now it's a bargaining chip, Mao, Staline, Khan (and you're reminded of that infamous star trek scene), they all hold rooms and they all negotiate, Hitler was not invited of the behest of Staline.Souls perform the most sordid of acts, to get 5, 10, minutes there, where they can see and perform their most diabolical of desires.You are not interested, however, you only lived for one thing, your wife, and you know her to be suffering.You don't need to spend those 5 minutes watching her suffer.So, for the foreseeable future, you're sane, sane and not at the mercy of their grubby and blood filled hands.After all "A man who answers to no one, is his own king", and that's, really, not so bad.
