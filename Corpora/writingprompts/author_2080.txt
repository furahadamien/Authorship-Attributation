Piss stained and covered in his own fecal matter, Professor D. hobbled down the alley towards a confused group of teens: Harry, Hermione, and Ron."The guys and I need to search your apartment, we think you're holding out on us."Professor D, a butch woman who only went by her last name (McGonagall) and some dude everyone called 'flitwick' entered.When these kids were sent to work sorting bags by their parents who owed debts, Prof. D thought it would be easy, but no.Here these little fuckers were, tweaked out of their goddamned brains."It's for your own good, we just wanna keep y'all safe. "" Do you think Black is still in the house?"Hermione asked.(Black was Harry's uncle, who had convinced them prof D wouldn't notice if a little horse went missing...) 
"Dumbledore obviously thinks he still is."Said Ron."It's lucky he picked tonight, you know, the one night Dumbledore, McGonagall, and flitwick were all dealing with the women who work at 'Hufflepuffs and Pleasure'" said Hermione as she rubbed the brick wall."Christ, this wall feels like velvet!"Ron began rubbing the wall too."Oooooo man.This is better than butterbeer!Harry, feel this wall!It's like poking your hand through a bubble!You've gotta, it's unbelievable!"Ron turned his head to look at Harry, but Harry was already way ahead of Ron."I'll do better than that!"And he ran through the wall.At least, as Hermione and Ron clapped their hands in applause, that's what they thought happened; however, Harry was on the ground... knocked the Fuck out.That's when the firing started."Oh shit!Black is still in there!"Ron screamed."Fuck Black!Harry is in there too now!You saw it, he ran through the wall!!!"Hermione shrieked.She tried to run in, but Ron grabbed her."He'll be fine!Dumbledore, flitwick and McGonagall are all still in there!They've got him!We need to go!"Hermione started crying."We can't leave him!We can't leave Harry!We're all he's got!"Ron looked at Hermione, "I love you."And he pushed her right onto a port key sending her to a much darker, danker cave.As the public saw it, right down a manhole.And that's when the dementors showed up.
