I blinked as I read the letter a second time.My first instinct was to throw it to the trash, but I stayed standing in front of my desk.My staff was greatly reduced, but I still had someone who went over my mail and selected the most interesting for me to personally read.Unless someone had sneaked into the new house and left this for me to read, which was unlikely, someone in my staff had considered this letter *this prank-* amusing enough to let me see it.Im not sure if I found it amusing.It was confusing more than anything, baffling that someone would sign as JFK, and even provide a number for me to call.I shrugged, and figured that lower standards for mail reception were part of the post-presidency.Hey, at least I might get the occasional funny letter.I put the letter in my drawer, making a mental note to show it to Michelle, once she got back from that *Fitness in the 21st Century* forum.I woke up when I heard the front door close, some hushed voices becoming louder as they approached my room.That was odd.Malia and Sasha used to talk in hushed voices when they were small, but that was during our early years in the White House, long before I was even elected to a second term.I stayed lying on the bed, but paid attention to the sounds.I recognised one of the voices: Patrick, the head of my personal security detail.The other was familiar, but annoyingly elusive.I had heard that voice, somewhere, but I couldnt remember when I had heard it and whose it was.I sat on the bad when I heard the voices reach the other side of the door; then it opened, and sure enough, Patrick was there, accompanied by an older man.I blinked, same as earlier in the day, because that face I did recognise.I apologise for disturbing you in your sleep, Mr President.I assure you, however, that this will be worth your time.

I opened my mouth, nothing came out, then closed it.I knew that face.Of course I did.Every American did, just like everyone knew that he had been assassinated nearly 70 years ago.President Kennedy?

He grinned and nodded, quickly turning to Patrick and asking him to leave us alone.I took that time to really look at the man in front of me.He was old, already a hundred by my math, yet he looked in good shape, reasonably agile, and definitely in a sound state of mind.He walked towards me, until he reached my bed, then sat by my side.Im sure you have my questions, Mr President.Ill try to get some of the obvious ones out of the way, and then you may ask me whatever it is you need to know.
He took a breath, as if preparing himself for a long, rehearsed speech, then started talking.Yes, I am indeed John F. Kennedy, and I am still alive.I survived what was in reality a staged assassination, which was planned in cooperation with Agent Lee Oswald.

This alone was a huge piece of information to process.I had taken a look at the classified files soon after my first inauguration, and they clearly said that Oswald had acted alone.I remember being disappointed, having been so sure that it had been a conspiracy.Yet here was Kennedy himself, telling me not only that it had been a conspiracy, but also that he was in on it!Yes, Dr King and Bobby were truly assassinated.Honestly, those are two of my greatest regrets, and arguably two of my greatest failures. He sighed, his face betraying a shadow of sadness, before he put himself together and continued talking.I have been watching your presidency with great interest.I will not pass judgement on the soundness of your policies, that is not my job, but I do believe, and others agree, that you displayed great skill in navigating the political arena, in generating hope and mobilising people towards a common goal.

I opened my mouth, ready to talk.He had noticed, and let me talk as soon as he finished his sentence.Others?

Yes.Im sure by now you may have guessed that there is much to the world than what you saw as President of the United States.Some former leaders are aware of our activities, and all Soviet leaders were fully briefed, but after myself, no US President has been informed on the existence of this organisation, let alone the full scope of its activities.At least while in office.

I was speechless, for the third or fourth time in the conversation, but this time I didnt even have the words in my head.How to believe all this?Kennedy was alive?He had staged his assassination to join a secret organisation?Soviet leaders knew, but American presidents were kept in the dark?What was this?Indeed, I had to know that.What is this?

Kennedy smiled, his wrinkles showing around his eyes and lips.This, Mr President, is your briefing.
