BadKermit
My eyes snapped open to an eggshell, popcorn ceiling because my ex is an imbecile.Id been having that dream again.The one where I can drive both a manual transmission car and a golf ball 300 yards, because I have my left arm back.I wish I could say I lost it heroically saving a baby from a thresher.Or at least had it shot off in war or blown up by one of those land mines that pops up in the air and explodes by your head.But Im neither a veteran, nor a hero of any sort.The truth is that I lost it because I got drunk, fell asleep in my bathtub, and slept on it wrong.Very wrong.For a very long time.When I woke up, it was aflame with the pins and needles of neglected circulation.So I waited.And waited.I went about my routine of making breakfast (at 11:00) and making plans and promises to myself to ensure that tomorrow will be a very productive day. But the pain didnt stop.In fact, it worsened.I had nearly dropped my plate when I threw it in the sink atop yesterdays dishes to soak. I took a shower, hoping the hot water on my arm would help the circulation.I even stretched for a while.Nothing.When the pain hadnt subsided by the early afternoon, I took a trip to the old sawbones.Thats what I call doctors, you see, because I like to seem interesting.I sat in the emergency room for 157 minutes of burning pain waiting for some intern to cautiously poke a needle at several sections of my arm and point out, correctly, that, no, I could not, in fact, feel that. He looked puzzled.You know.Like an intern.And then he called for backup.Lots of backup.Some doctors from outside of the ER.And then some from outside the hospital.And then some from outside the county.I lost count of the number of tests and number of minutes that came and went after that initial 157 minutes.It was in five digits, at least.The minutes, that is.The experts couldnt figure it out.It seemedbut didnt looklike severe nerve damage.The most coherent explanation I got was from a neurologist with a very German-sounding name.Its like your arm justdied.

What?What do you mean?

Its like your arm passed away peacefully in its sleep.

What??What do you mean??

Its as though your arm is the bad neighborhood of your body, and all of your blood and nerve endings have decided to drive around it to get to your heart and brain.

What???What do you mean???

It went on like this for fewer than 157 minutes, but not that many fewer, bless that doctors heart.Ultimately, it was explained to me that my body basically shut down my arm, and my arm died.So, I was left with a choice.Live the rest of my life with an eventually-rotting hunk of flesh hanging off my left side and likely killing the rest of me, or let them cut it off.Thats a weird subject to broach on Tinder, so I chose the latter.The surgery went as planned, and I walked out of the hospital down one appendage and up one gnarly scar.As you might imagine, I missed my arm.I missed it so much, I could sense it still there.It itched, but there was nowhere to scratch it.It ached, but there was nowhere to rub it.Until you lose a limband I sincerely hope that you dontits hard to imagine what phantom pain is.Regular pain is so easy to comprehend that seventy-five percent of songwriters are able to adequately put it into words.But trying to get your brain around phantom pain is like trying to contemplate dying and not existing.Or trying to imagine what existed before the Big Bang puked out all of the junk that would eventually lead to our existence.Or trying to read Infinite Jest.So you can imagine my surprise when I woke up that morning to find my arm back, thrown behind my pillow as it used to be in the good old days.Had it been the good old days, the old lug would have been dozing comfortably asleep on the job, with the same pins and needles that had led to its downfall.But it wasnt.It was there.And it was emitting a subtle, blue glow.What????What do you mean???? I screamed at my arm.It said nothing.And then it pointed to the foot of my bed.I did that thing you should never do if youre easily startled or if you ever find yourself in the midst of a B-grade horror movie.I slowly lifted my gaze from my arm to the foot of the bed.There stood my ex, staring up at the eggshell, popcorn ceiling like an imbecile.The best time to mention that my ex had died of an overdose three years after we divorced would have been at the beginning of this tale.The second-best time would be right now.She slowly dropped her gaze to me at a rate that seemed like it would be a bad thing to do if you were ever the star ghost of a B-grade movie.And then she started screaming.For slightly more than 157 minutes, I was frozen in an unusual mix of terror and annoyanceI sincerely hope you dont experience this as I was lambasted by the specter of my dead ex-wife telling me how it didnt matter how I described my dead arm on Tinder, since no one would ever love me through my faults.Then, of its own accord, my missing, glowing left hand clenched itself into a tight fist.
