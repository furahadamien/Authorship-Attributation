"So what is new?"I said stepping out of the capsule with my buddy as usually awaiting my arrival.I had no control over when I would arrive due to the randomness of the generator.I never knew if I was jumping a a few days, years, or even thousands of years.All I knew is when I left, I went forward through time and had no control over it.My first jump took me 100 years forward, when I stepped out all I knew and loved was gone.I was a mess...I contemplated suicide.But then my guardian angel came...a man I only ever got to know as "Joe."Not sure if he was ever connected to the mysterious capsule that fell from the sky, or just a lucky break for a poor soul such as I.Although I could never prove it I felt he was connected; Joe always knew where I would land.He said he got these straight *feelings* and *visions* as to when and where I would arrive* All I did know for sure was he saved my life.He got me back on my feet, gave me a purpose and ever since then I have been traveling forward through time, an explorer had been born."Hey..."  Said Joe, looking tired and weak.I had not seen him like that since Rome had fallen."How was your trip?""Joe, you know it was not really a trip for me buddy!How was YOUR Trip??"I made light of what I was seeing, but after knowing him for so many years, even if I didn't know much about his past, I knew something was up."Things have been...interested."He said behind estranged eyes."Ok Joe, whats up buddy...what is going on.How long have I been gone, what is the current date?I don't see too many changes.Is this, New York?Where are the...where are the towers if this is New York?"Tears swelled up in his eyes.One of the curses of being immortal was that you lived forever and saw all the ugly the world had to offer...unlike myself who had the ability to leave it all behind, a curse in of itself, Joe had to suffer more than anymore."They fell my friend...the world has become...chaotic.A year after you left...everything fell apart.Terrorists attacked...the stock market collapsed when the housing market fell...it's been bad.The world is not what it used to be; technology beyond your imagine has come about but with it has come evils which I can only begin to fathom.""Joe...what year is it?"More tears swelled up."It's only 2018..."

"TWO-THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN?IT'S ONLY BEEN 18 FUCKING YEARS AND THIS IS HOW BAD IT HAS GOTTEN?!What the fuck Joe!The world is only still just recovering from the the last two great wars, I thought we were on a good track..." 

His jaw tightened and he looked me sternly in the eyes, his were filled with fire."That's not the worst of it.You just missed the last election two years ago....Donald Trump is the President now..."

I said nothing...I turned around, stepped back into the capsule and said fuck it.Here is to the next jump being better.
