You know the old cliche, "Time froze for a moment when..."?It's certainly not all it's cracked up to be when you're not the one who's in control.The first time I experienced a time stop, I'd fumbled my keys on a rainy day.As I started the useless gesture of the bobble and catch, they slowed and then stopped in the air.They remained frozen along with every drop of rain hanging in the air for the next few seconds while I completed the awkward catch in complete silence of a frozen world.I stood there in shock as the rain returned to soaking me while I stood near my car in shock.Holy crap, I had powers!Around 60 years ago, people started to get abilities.They originally blamed it on the atomic bombs, but after years of study, no one's found an answer as to why it started.We've discovered some weird rules as to how they work though.1:  Powers are rare.This is the most soul crushing childhood discovery next to finding out Santa wasn't real.Everyone wanted powers.When you're a kid, it's all dreams of super heroes in all their paneled page glory.2:  Powers always manifest in pairs.Nearly all pairs were twins.Siblings will sometimes gain powers, and there are reported cases once in a while of half siblings developing powers.This lead people to study if there was some sort of quantum genetic link, but there's been no genetic link found.3:  Power pairs are always opposing in effect, yet complimentary in what they affected.The first well known pair was a set of twins named Robert and Dale Kingsman.They could heat and freeze water on command.They'd been making a killing as stage magicians before their powers were discovered with an act that had the big finale be a take on the classic water tank escape.It started with the standard chains and straight jacket, but then it took a powered twist.Robert would be bound and lowered into the tank while Dale would be outside.He would then freeze the water tank, taking care to let Robert melt enough water around himself to not freeze and melt a drain hole at the bottom.They'd then pull the tank away leaving the mostly solid block of ice center stage.After he'd freed himself, Robert would quickly melt the walls to have the ice shatter around him in a rather stunning display.They now have a show in Vegas where they use their powers openly.4:  Powers only work when the pair are in fairly close range.There is a direct link that proves powers increase in potency when the pair are near each other, even the widest range powers can only reach about twenty yards and stay effective.There is a cautionary tale of a bother/sister pair who could increase and decrease air pressure who were working as underwater welders.I'll spare the gory details, but it ends in them both getting the bends 50 meters underwater because they stopped holding hands.I stood in the rain getting soaked while trying to piece it together.I was shifting between ecstatic and confused.I couldn't have powers.But I'd just stopped time!Who was my partner?I was an only child.Did I just discover some deep dark family secret?WHERE was my partner?The parking lot was empty, the only living thing in nearly 100 yards was a soggy looking seagull that was picking at a trash can.Shaking my head, I got in the car and start to head home.Ten minutes into the drive, I nearly slammed my face into the steering wheel when it happened again.I had about half a second to brace as everything around me slowed and stopped... except me.The stories all  seemed like once the power manifested, the pairs instinctively knew how to control them.Just another puzzle to solve.Fortunately, I managed to get home with all my teeth in my mouth.There were three more stops on the way home, each getting slightly quicker and lasting longer.I don't know if it continued as I was asleep, but it only got worse the next day.You know how annoying it is to have a video buffer?I will never complain about that again now that my actual life was buffering.Every five minutes, everything would just stop for about 45 seconds.It was getting worse, each one longer than the last.Making an appointment at the research center was an exercise in patience, I couldn't tell if I'd been put on hold or if time had stopped again.I was starting to figure out what I could affect while stopped at least.Stuff I touch would continue moving as long as I was touching it.Simple machines would keep working, so I could ride a bike, but my car would lock in place just like the first day.I was thankful for bikes at least working, the university was across town and I didn't want to walk 15 miles.I pedaled my way east, I started to really think about it.I must have had stopped at least 250 times by now without any control over them... Maybe it wasn't my ability that was causing this.During the next stop, I concentrated on my watch that had stopped like everything else in the world and willed it to start moving.While everything else was still silent and still, I heard my answer in a resoundingly solid tick.After time began moving again, I concentrated on my watch until the next stop.I compared it to a frozen bank sign.It was three minutes ahead.It only took two more stops to figure out that I could cancel it nearly instantly, fast enough I was confident enough to ride a bus the rest of the way.When I arrived at the research center, the stops were up to a half hour each, roughly every ten seconds.The only thing preventing me from being trapped in a frozen hell was my ability to cancel it.They took scans, poked and prodded, had me demonstrate my ability, and finally sent me to a waiting isolation room.A pair of undergrads named Karen and Kelly pointed out the coverings of the room and explained that they'd been able to create a material that dampened powers to such an extent that an inch of it could nearly shut off a pair's ability.They demonstrated it with Kelly producing a ball of light while Karen walked out of the room.The light immediately went out.After the twins had left, I looked around at my refuge.The room was covered in two feet of the wool like material, which seemed like overkill since Karen had said in testing no pair could activate powers through more than 4 inches of the stuff.The reassuring hum of the lights overhead and the ticking of the clock convinced me that everything was fine.They were doing measurements and tests  in the next room, there was a camera with a monitor that I could talk to them through.They had a nice setup here, I kicked back in the chair and relaxed with a magazine, glad I might have some answers soon.For the first time in two days, I felt in control.The soft chatter of the lab blended into the background noise as I was reading about the new Nissan, it was very peaceful in the isolation room.It was silent except the beating of my heart-  No!Panicked, I look up at the clock that's frozen in time, the lab feed, just a still life.Reaching out for my pair, if they weren't going to stop this, I'd make sure they knew where I was.I pushed outward with all the frustration and rage, panic and fear.Suddenly, everything was moving at chipmunk speed in the lab, and I could feel it, somehow.My pair was here.I let the bubble fall, exhausted.Kelly rushed into the room, confused as I explained what had happened.It was then that another lab coat came rushing in with some xrays.They'd found the answer.I looked at the film, dumbfounded.There, tucked underneath my rib, was the twin I must have absorbed in the womb.Our power was so strong because we not only had physical contact, we were one in the same.The doctor had suggested surgery to remove my unexpected passenger, although it may be difficult with the time stops being nearly continual now."This would, of course, result in the loss of your abilities, but-" 

As he said that, I let the cancellation drop.Time locked into place while I came up with a plan.As the doctor stood there, still frozen, I walked out into the lab and found a laptop bag to the side of someone's desk.I gathered all of documents they had been working on, pushed small bubbles of normal time into the computers to delete anything created over the last few days, removing any and all traces I'd ever been there.I walked out the doors to a new, wonderful world of silence that was mine for the taking.It might not be the comics, but Super Powers has a bit of a ring to it.
