I hope this is ok.It's the first one I've done and was written on mobile so might have a few errors.Feedback is welcome.It had been 200 years since Elon Musk had made history by launching his car into space.Since then, society had become much more advance.The current "M" of MI6 always stopped to look at the wall of lost agents.The legendary James Bond always stuck out, possibly because they had never satisfactorily answered what had happened.As M got to his office, the current 007 stopped flirting with M's assistant and greeted her with a respectful "Ma'am"."007, back from Mars I see.Find anything worthwhile on Space X?""No ma'am.They're either as charitable as they seem or extremely good at hiding it.I did find something else of interest though"

007 helped himself to some scotch.Even if it was artificial, it was still good.M sighed in disapproval as she sat down."007, it is 9am.No time for Scotch.And do not tell me you're adjusting to Earth time, I know for a fact it is 7am equivalent at the colony on Mars!"007 downed the glass, and decided not to pour another after some brief eye contact with M. Choose your battles he thought to himself."Take a seat and explain this something else of interest.Quickly if you please."007 took a seat and a deep breath."During my mission I.... Liased with Elon Musk's great, great granddaughter.Several times actually.Even once in a rover!But I digress.She mentioned to me that a deep family secret is that Musk was actually a madman and that if his family hadn't stopped him, he would have taken over the world.It was only after the launch of the first falcon heavy that he became more benevolent, almost like a completely different person.She stated that in his later years, that he said he was at peace now, that his greatest enemy was far, far away listening to David Bowie.I believe James Bond was in the car Musk launched past Mars two centuries ago."M sat in stunned silence.She knew Bond had been at the Space X facility on Earth on the night his name was removed from the list of code names out of respect to an MIA agent.But they had never know what he was investigating, only that he had had a hunch.Could this be true?"Where would the car be now?""Well out into deep space now.It left our solar system around 150 years ago."Replied 007.He was calm on the outside, but internally he was excited.He had wanted that code name ever since he had got 00 status.He hadn't felt this good even when he'd stolen the last Aston Martin DB5 on Earth from the transport museum.All M had to do was suggest...

"We should attempt to retrieve the body.Have Q set this up, with the cover story being that it's for historical scientific research."007 nodded, and almost screamed with victory.He left at once to make arrangements, not even acknowledging M's disappointed and slightly flustered secretary.A few months later, 007 awoke from a standard 8 hour period of sleep on the craft taking him to rendevouz with the space Tesla.While not widely used, faster-than-light travel was possibly, unsurprisingly made so by Space X.He took a crafty swig from his hip flask, worrying that it felt less than half full.Navy dullards didn't allow alcohol on board.They were due to meet the car today, and it was all 007 could do to keep his cool exterior in place."We've got it Commander!"Yelled an Ensign to 007.Trust them to use his naval rank.007 ran forward, letting his facade slip slightly.Through the forward viewport, a small dot could be seen getting closer each second.He grinned in anticipation.Preparations to take the car onboard were made.Two agnosing hours later in which the hip flask became more empty, the car was on board.007 approached it slowly marvelling at the fact that this thing was 200 years old.The paint was destroyed, the metal itself warped and covered in pockmarks.The space suit was in tatters, but amazingly the visor was still in tact.The body was very well preserved by the vacuum of space.007 reverently removed the helmet, paused for a second, and laughed out loud for sometime.When he had got himself under control, he reached out for a comm unit and contacted M, still chuckling to himself as he looked at the frozen face of Elon Musk.
