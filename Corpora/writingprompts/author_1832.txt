This prison is all I've ever known.The world knows your luck rating as soon as your born.I entered the world, my luck rating was seen, and I was taken away from my parents.They must have had low-luck ratings.Most 100s have low-luck parents.I was brought to this maximum security prison only hours after I was born.It didn't always feel like a prison.I was nursed by volunteer mothers who could still produce breast milk.There were other infants that I played with and grew up with.As we got older, there was less and less play time and more solitary time to ourselves.Once we were old enough, we got a cell that became our new home.For, well, forever.Every inmate wore an ankle cuff.Scientists figured out a way to "turn off" our luck, so to speak.And once it's on and our luck is gone, there's no way to get it off.They are made of the strongest metals on earth.Nothing will break these.Except a solar flare.Of course, I didn't know that's what happened until years later and I still don't have an explanation as to why.It was 4 am.I couldn't sleep so I was listening to the rumble of snores around the prison.Then everyone in the prison simultaneously beeped.The sound was so soft that, if it occurred during the day, no one would've heard it.But in that 4 am silence, I was the loudest sound in the prison.Even over the snores.I never knew what being lucky felt like before.It was stripped away before I could even have memories.But the feeling that rushes through my body seconds after that beep left me breathless.I knew it was my luck.I knew I could escape.And hopefully, no one else was awake and trying to escape either.I started to fiddle with the ankle cuff and it nearly fell apart in my hands.I removed some wires that hopefully disabled it and then reattached it to make it look like it was still on and functioning.I've never had better sleep in my life.By the time I woke up, everything seemed normal.There were no alarms.No missing inmates.It appeared as know I was the only one who knew what happened last night.The hardest part should've been pretending like I didn't have my luck back.But who am I kidding?It was the easiest thing in the world.'Cause I'm lucky.I understand why they lock us up.Us 100s.I could've murdered someone and no one would've seen it.There were no eyes on my as I was walking around.My luck caused them to always look away when they came close to looking at me.I walked straight out the front door into a world I had never seen before.I don't know when my ankle cuff fell off.
