Warhead could feel the mans eyes on him as he walked down the brightly lit hallway, passing through all of the millimeter scanners, metal detectors, and other high tech security measures that stood between him and his destination.//This prison is much nicer than that piece of scum deserves, he thought to himself.Too bad all of this is necessary to keep him in check.The man he was going to see had been the most notorious and destructive villain of an age flooded with heroes and villains alike.The Maroon Marauder had been taken too lightly at the beginning of his career.He was nothing more than a bankrobber, and had never gone up against a superhero.It was believed that his powers were trivial at best, even his name was laughable.But When the Marauder transitioned from bank robbing to plans of world domination and other larger schemes, he demolished almost every hero he came up against.Few could claim to have faced him in pitched battle and lived to tell the tale.When Warhead finally made it to the end of the hall, and saw the man that this high tech prison had been specifically designed to contain, he could not help but feel the same sense of disappointment he always felt.//This is the man whos name caused the world to tremble in fear?The Marauders powers had slowed his aging, both physically and intangibly.While other villains of his age lost control of their powers with the advancement of time, the Marauder had only grown more powerful, discovering and honing new abilities over the course of what would have been many lifetimes.Warhead and the Marauder stared at each other for minutes before either spoke.The villain was built like your average middle aged man- obviously with some strength in him, but not in the best shape.In his pale grey prison jumpsuit, the man looked even less like a super villain than he did the day Warhead had finally apprehended him.Then, the man had looked like any other average Joe in a black suit.He was nowhere near as visually intimidating as some of his contemporaries, but his eyes betrayed a cold intelligence that was enough to make even Warhead doubt himself.The villain finally broke the silence.So youve finally come to see me?I had estimated you would have made an appearance to gloat over your victory long before this. 

Warhead just chuckled.I didnt come here for that.You know why Im here.Give up the location of your doomsday devices.The League believes them too dangerous to be left in the world, even if no one has ever discovered your lair of dismay. His voice dripped with sarcasm and arrogance, and it did not go unnoticed.Ill give them up, but first you and I need to talk. The villain finally said, an air of frustration around him.What you did that day was disgusting, and I need to know how anyone could justify your actions.

What actions? Warhead roared with laughter, Bringing down the most notorious villain in the galaxy?I did something no hero before me could.Not even Captain Fission could stop you, and I did it before any of your henchmen even had a chance to react!

The disrespect you still show him is unacceptable!Captain Fission was the greatest hero this world has ever seen!The measure of a hero does not only lie in strength, boy.That is the one lesson it seems you failed to learn from him. The Marauder tossed back, anger now visible in his eyes.LEARN FROM HIM? The air around Warhead began to shimmer with radiation.Warhead didnt notice until the alarms started blaring and flashing red light.Warhead reigned in his signature heat, but his rage was still palpable.That man taught me nothing.Everything I am, I made myself.What is more important in a hero than the strength of his power? He asked through gritted teeth.Compassion.Loyalty.Duty.Honor.Any of these, and so many more!Fission was more than just a bomb, you oaf!He truly believed in what he was doing.He did it to protect innocents, not to win fame and glory!You cast him out of the league that he founded! The Marauder spat, with growing animosity."He was useless!Old, weak, unable to control his powers!He was a danger to everyone in the same room as him.He gave Wonderboy radiation poisoning!Who knows how many others he could have hurt if we had kept him around! Warhead retorted."The league was his life!His friends, his family!And you just threw him on the street! The Marauder responded.A man who had done that much good deserved more respect.A pension at the least, and visits when he took a turn for the worst.His lifelong friends even stopped coming to see him.His children

"What is the point in this?Im growing impatient, old man."Warhead spat.The air was beginning to shimmer again.Just tell me the location of your hideout so I can leave and be done with all of this.

At this the Marauders composure broke.Tears streamed down his face- You and the league showed no respect for him in life, but even the worst villains can honor the dead.How dare you interrupt his funeral?How many of us did you arrest that day?We showed up to honor that man, the one man who truly made each and every one of us question why crime was our career.The one man capable of teaching regret The one man who ever showed me compassion

Dont act like you knew him. Warhead fired back, with venom in his voice.No one knew him.
    
But I grew to know him.I visited him every day in the hospital.I designed the suits that made it safe for doctors and nurses to be within a mile of him.Every one of the villains you arrested that day did more for him when he was vulnerable than any of his friends did when he was strong. The Marauder retorted, his voice barely more than a whisper.He was crumpling, eyes glistening.You know he spoke of you?

Dont.Nothing you say can make me forgive him.I gave him everything he ever gave me. Warhead retorted.His skin now began to shimmer and glow, setting off the alarms again.He did.He regretted missing so much of your life.The baseball games, the choir concerts, everything.He still had all of your trophies, and your sisters too.Even the soccer participation trophy from the one season you played in the fourth grade. Tears were rolling down the Marauders face at this point.He was sorry.Fission- your father- he was trying to make the world safe for you, so you wouldnt have to live the life he did.

SHUT YOUR MOUTH! Warhead roared.He was never there for me, for my sister, for anyone!He spent so much time saving his precious innocents that he forgot to raise his children! 

Memories flash before Warheads eyes, but they were not his.A projection, probably an unknown power of the Marauders.He sees an old man struggling along with a walker, slowly hobbling next to the Marauder, with a relaxed smile on his face.The same man, now with tears streaming down his face and look of confusion and hurt as his own powers cause him to be wracked with pain.That man again, proudly holding a newspaper with a photo of Warhead in his hands, saying This is my son!I'm so proud of him!

The man, now lying still, apparently sleeping peacefully.This man again, lying in his best suit in a wooden box.The viewpoint turns, scanning the vast sea of empty chairs.Few people are in attendance- Warhead recognized them all as Super villains, all of whom Captain Fission had arrested at one point or another.Suddenly the ground shakes and the sky turns red.The mans coffin collapses and he falls into the freshly dug grave, and Warhead sees himself sprinting into view, followed closely by a few other heroes.The projection goes black, and then fades from view.Warhead straightened up, cast one last heartless glance at the Marauder, and began to walk away.//What a complete waste of time.I guess I'll have to find the devices the old fashioned way.The Marauder wilted like an unwatered flower.I see this is futile.Well, if you wont remember all of the good that he did, or the lives he saved, we will.He deserved more than you gave him.He deserved a family that loved him the way he loved you."// Sorry about the father/son trope, but I thought it would add weight to the story.Sorry for any typos/awkward formatting, I'm on mobile.*edit: formatting, spelling
