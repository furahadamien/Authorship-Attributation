'How was your day honey?'Thumbas placed his hat on the coatrack, and his coat on the dishrack, and dished out a dollop of candy as he sighed into a chair at the table.'Well, i passed by this artist on the way home.He made a picture of my favorite fire arm.He told me I could have it if I gave him my wallet, but as he reached out for it, and slapped it to the ground.Now the ally was dark, and i looked at the photo again and turned out it was a cat, but the man was pushing the wallet along the ground.''Why that's odd.'Whyphe said, dealing another hand to the Poker Night Pixies.'Something wrong with him?''Yea.'Thumbas exclaimed, 'his hand was of a pool cue and he was shooting it down the road.It went on so long, I thought the wallet gained sentience and began to yell.Turns out I was stepping on the tail of the cat the guy drew.Felt guilty I did.''Well did you get your wallet back?''Oh, right, it should be safe now.'
