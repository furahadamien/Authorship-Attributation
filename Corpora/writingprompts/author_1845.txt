I'll be the first to admit that my life has always been pretty easy.Born with a luck score of 100 and a charming smile, I learned fairly early on that I usually could get my way.Coin flips, card games, tests; you name it, I was naturally good at it.I was good at doing things without trying, but even better at keeping people from noticing that something was up.And for years, I was content with acing tests and winning small lotteries, things that anyone with drive and a luck score above 60 can do.But eventually, I got bored.And I started doing more.Pickpocketing, robbing banks, scamming con men on the streets.It was practiallly child's play, with the way wallets would fall onto the street in front of me, cameras would short circuit the moment I walked into banks, and weathered con men wiuld somehow forget to pocket the queen of hearts.But it was exciting to know that I could get away with things right under their noses.I loved the thrill.My life was perfect.Until it wasn't.After all, perfect luck means nothing if other equally lucky people set out directly to oppose you.Then, it really is a coin flip.Which I now have had a taste of how it feels to lose.And this day, I lost the biggest coin flip of my life.Her name was Sharon.Blonde, optomistic, brand new to the task force, and somehow managed to get put on my case.Another 100.She was tracking me for barely a day when I lost.The alarm in the store went off as I was out the door, and we ran into each other.It jumpstarted her career, and it ended my life.Obviously, I was nonplussed when she caught me.After all, I am perfectly lucky.I was sure my case would get thrown out, or I would find a way to escape.That is, until I found out where I was going.Maximum security, made especially for people like us, she said.There was a task force of other 100s that spent days finding every vulnerability, until nothing is left to chance.Being lucky is useless if there's no luck involved, after all.The most cruel part is, nearly no one tries to escape, because there's a simple way out.None of us are allowed to talk to each other, but every day, a 100 guard will give us an option: to stay, or leave.Ifwe all choose to stay, we get to all leave.If anyone chooses to leave, they get to, and everyone who chose to stay is stuck.But if everyone chooses to leave, we all stay.The fucking prisoner's dilema.It should be a no brainer to get the luckiest criminals in the world to get out.Especially under one common goal.But the paranoia sets in.Fear of letting your trusting luck be used against you by a more selfish inmate.Fear of a guard coaxing a prisoner to break the mold, in promises of freedom.Hundreds of, well, 100s, pitted against one another, rendering their luck null.No one confined in this prison has ever left, because every single person behind these bars wishes to leave every single day.This is a little rough, so I apologize.It was a really fun prompt, though.
