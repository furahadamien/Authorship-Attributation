Ja'lor was rushing in the halls of the Galactic Council Spire, it's been only a Galactic year since the rather controversial decree of galaxy wide population control was implemented.A rather bloated 30 page document summed up in, "One Born, One Dies" The backlash was extreme, that was until the Council Fleets glassed the rebellious worlds, now a year later it's accepted.The council is 12 representatives among the long lived species, the ancient ones, as they are popularly called.They command the most powerful fleets, technology indistinguishable to magic, and an arrogance that makes Ja'lor's scales shiver in both fear and disgust.However the news Ja'lor holds is an unprecedented occurrence, a system of 20 Billion sentients, 6 billion on a single world alone.Well beyond the 3-5 billion allowed for an emerging species.He reached the massive and ornate doors of the council chambers and ushered in as if expected, one of the ancient ones attributes that surprised him the first day as a Council Servitor 15 years ago, and which unnerves him even today."Servitor Ja'lor, what news do you bring in such a hurry?"1st One Malde'v asked in his usual elegant tone, Ja'lor bows respectfully as he answers, "An anomaly 1st One.A system was found in a recently surveyed galactic arm.A system of 20 Billion sentients."Silence.Ja'lor was confused, he looked up and saw relief on the 1st One's face?!"I see, finally The Cause is found."In disbelief Ja'lor forgot himself, "1st One?Cause of what?"The 1st One ignored his breach of protocol and instead answered, "The Cause of the great extinctions of the past centuries Ja'lor.There's a limit to how many sentients exist in this galaxy, when one is born one must die.""Your decree 1st One?"Ja'lor asked still not understanding him."This is a universal truth Servitor."3rd One Grasitas stated as fact, "You see Ja'lor we recently discovered a truth, sentient life is connected in ways even we knew not."1st One added."Death and life is cyclic and our souls emerge and return into a finite well of 8th dimensional space.""So the decree is a public symbol of this universal truth?!"Ja'lor was dumbfounded."Indeed Ja'lor.Few would accept this willingly, fewer still will without violence, so we played villainous and wrote such an unreasonable decree.""However the problem still remains Malde'v, what to do with this species, do we cast aside our ethic again?"7th One Hyllia spoke in a sharp tone unbecoming her renowned beauty."Hyllia, your feelings does not change reality.One born means one's death.Not one in this council pretends the universe is fair."1st One retorts in an exasperated tone, clearly an argument these ancient one's have had before, 'I guess these ancient ones do have a heart' Ja'lor thought in the privacy of his own mind.1st One then looked at him squarely, bringing Ja'lors hearts to his throat, "Ja'lor go and bring representatives of this species, and tells us of them now so we may prepare."\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ja'lor told them of the emerging species who call themselves Human and of their system called Sol.The council listened silent and patiently as he presented the summery of their history, their art, and nature.A species of contradictions, of great violence, of great achievement, and once done Ja'lor took the 109th Fleet to make contact.Now Ja'lor sits in a cell deep within a moon called Io, looking at a Human male in the eyes.Ja'lor can see the human thinking, calculating, as he has seen within the eyes of the 1st One.The survey was way out of date, the Humans had grown into a local super power, and the Fleet lay waste in a dozen systems in what the Humans call The Orion Arm.Not a single system, but a Federation of systems and species bore down on the fleet, once Ja'lor informed the Humans of the council's decree they reacted like the rebellious ones.However they won their rebellion, they cause so much extinction, ironically, because they emerged into the galaxy as nation builders, protecting life from tyrants.Ignorant of a truth that even Ja'lor finds hard to believe.Such a contradicting species these Humans are!The Human exhaled then half chuckled, "So that's the story.This council believes such a thing?"he asked, Ja'lor nodded, "They do."The translator on the Human's ear recited his words in their harsh language.The Human smiled, "Well I think we should put this war to an end then Ja'lor."Ja'lor blinked, "What do you mean?"The Human laughed, "I mean, I want to meet this council.If they have proof of such a thing it's worth a listen.The Orion Federation isn't so arrogant to perpetuate war for such an absurdity.If peace can be made, make it as I say.War is no good to anyone."Such an attitude.Ja'lor just nodded.A day later Ja'lor sat in guest quarters of the Human's flagship on his way to the capital.Wondering what in the abyss just happened.
