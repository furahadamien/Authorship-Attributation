I grumble under my breath as I kneel beside my patient.He complains that he "can't breath".I quickly remind him that he wouldn't be able to speak with me, nor complain about an array of different issues if he couldn't breath.I asses his positioning, he's very casual.Not bolt upright or in a tripod posture.His color is slightly off.A touch ashen.He continues to whine by speaking full sentences.Clearly not having too much distress.I finally lean in to auscultate his lung sounds.I lift his shirt and place my right ear firmly onto his chest.After a brief moment.I realize my stethoscope was hanging out of my leg cargo pocket.
