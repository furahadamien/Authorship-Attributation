My life already sucked, well before I had lost my left arm to an explosion while holding a faulty grenade, in a battle scene mostly dominated by idiots like me.Forget which war it is.All wars are stupid.Shortly thereafter, the suckery got intensified, phantom pains began, haunting my absent arm.I then started battling it, again, applying the technique which I am most familiar with - the help of cannabis and liquor.And just recently, upon hitting the bottles and lighting up fat ass joints one after another, in my lazy couch, I have suddenly discovered a ghost sitting next to me.My initial reaction was to punch him as hard as possible.The ghost screamed: What the f-ck!?? And I screamed: Woha!

I was both amazed and scared to death.And he was equally angry yet frightened.As soon as my initial reaction faded, I had discovered I hit him with my arm that is not there.I mean, I was just sitting here man.What the f-ck is wrong with you?And you are one hard-hitter, you know that?

But you are a ghost, and by definition you cannot be penetrated by anything material.

Yea that is weird.

Did you see that?Did you see how I have punched you?

Well, I did not see that coming.

Well I did not see YOU are coming either!

As a ghost, I can confirm that this matter goes into existential territory, about which I have superior knowledge yet do not fancy discussing it at the moment.And my cheek hurts.

You are one posh ghost.Come here I am gonna slap you with my ghost palm.

You dont want to do that.SLAP.Oh cmon!That is it!I am leaving!
