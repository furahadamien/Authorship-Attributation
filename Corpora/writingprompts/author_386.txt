Four digits?FOUR?In all my years as a bouncer, never four.I looked into his calm, green eyes."Jesus," I said.Of course I let him in.Even The Man needs to kick back and grab a beer sometimes, yeah?But, given that he's back...I wouldn't make any long-term plans if I were you.And stock up on some prepper material while you're at it.Shit about to get real.And have a nice night, y'all.
