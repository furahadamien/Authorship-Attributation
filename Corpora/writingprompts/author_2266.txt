The sun was high overhead before Turliss decided to take a break from his work.Clicking the Compile button on his computer, he stood up and stretched his limbs.A cryptologic linguist by trade, his work was generally not what one would consider to be exciting, but to him, being selected to help decipher the language of the Ancient Ones was the chance of a lifetime.Officially, they were called Berkerians, as the remnants of their civilization were found on a planet orbiting the white dwarf Berke.To the researchers studying them, they were known as the Ancient Ones because they came into being billions of years before any other sentient species.Were it not for a hyperspace surveying team stumbling upon traces of Berkerian debris on a moon orbiting Berke-3, the Ancient Ones would have completely been forgotten by time.As the surveying team was plotting new hyperspace routes through the Berke system, they came across several piles of scrap metal, unusual as the system was supposed to be uninhabitable.Tests of the metal would eventually reveal it to be billions of years old, far, far older than the oldest known sentient species.The discovery sent shockwaves throughout every known species in the universe.The major religions called it blasphemous, declaring the discovery to be an attempt to subvert the faith of their gods.Many historians scoffed at the idea of such an ancient race, claiming it was scientifically impossible for an intelligent species to exist so long ago.Things went on like that for a while until the second discovery was made.A research team digging in the bedrock of an ancient ocean found what they thought was a cave; closer inspection would reveal that it was a massive outline of what is now believed to be an Ancient One.The size of the outline was enormous, dwarfing every known species, but traces of copper along the walls of the outline suggested that this was once a statue and not the remains of an Ancient One themselves.More discoveries would slowly come to light; a primitive tool here, a shard of pottery there, but it would be the discovery of the Chip that would set things into motion.Found embedded in limestone deep in the remains of an ancient city, Artifact #12880 (otherwise known as the Chip) was the first artifact to be found intact and was the first to denote any hint of technological advancement for the Ancient Ones.The Chip was a tiny device, smaller than the claw on a Vorians small finger.Being trapped in rock away from the elements left it in remarkable condition despite its age, a blessing for the scientists lucky enough to study it.Once the scientists determined that the Chip was a storage device of some kind, the next step was to determine if there was any data stored on it, not an easy task as the risk of damaging the Chip was great.Many of the greatest engineers in the known galaxies jumped at the chance to work on the Chip.Putting together their heads, they were able to create an interface device that could read the data stored on the Chip, revealing a single badly-fragmented audio file of some sort.With the breakthrough at hand, a group of audio technicians and language specialists were brought on to rebuild and decipher the file, which is where Turliss came in.Specializing in dead languages, Turliss job was to take the data compiled by the audio team and attempt to recreate the original audio file, a task he had been working on for many cycles.He did not mind; to him, working on the language of the Ancient Ones was almost a religious experience.The opportunity to listen to a species that went extinct long before his own had even come into being was almost too much to bear.He turned towards his workstation and noticed a flashing light.He smiled; the last file fragment had finished compiling.He sat back down at his desk and put on his headphones; he would be the first person to hear the voice of the Ancient Ones in eons, and he did not want any outside noise to spoil it.He started to shake in anticipation and wondered what was on the Chip.Was it words of wisdom from a people long past?Words of warning about whatever fate befell them?Maybe even music?Turliss pressed the play button.A fragment of an ancient news broadcast began to play.His jaws dropped as the words of the Ancient Ones filled his mind with more emotions than he could define.Before he could collect himself, the audio ended as abruptly as it started.Turliss sat motionless, too shocked to even move.This, he thought to himself, This is why I was born.To bring life once more to those who would have been forgotten by time.

It would be a long while before he could even begin to translate the words of the Ancient Ones.For now, he was content with being able to hear their voices.He smiled and pressed the play button again, and waited for the last words of the Ancient Ones to come to life once more:

Man, those Samoans are a surly bunch.
