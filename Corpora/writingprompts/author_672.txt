It took over fifty years, and a homicide for them to discover it.This was because of two things: the first part being how the anti\-aging drug worked was strengthening your skin\-\-no more paper cuts, no more scratches, no more bruises.But also because the process of your blood turning to acid was so slow that your veins were able to evolve, to harden against the acidity, and so was your heart, and your arteries, everything inside your body was able to evolve, but your skin never touched it, and although your skin was stronger, acid still hurt like hell, it just took a lot longer for it to eat away at you.What happened was that Bill, he was one of the lost generation\-\-those folks that were too old to take the drug safely as they said back then\-\-was furious at his partner.See, Bills partner, Richard, had been taking the anti\-aging drug for nearly 50 years, Bill was only three years older than Richard but Bill looked 50 years older than Richard because Richard hadnt aged past 25.And Bill was convinced that Richard was cheating on him and the only reason they were still together was because Richard wanted Bills money, but also because Bill was jealous of Richards eternal youth and beauty.So Bill killed him, stabbed him in his sleep.Unknown to Bill, Richard, and the rest of the world was the anti-aging drug had turned Richards blood to acid, and as the acid sprayed out of his stomach like a fountain, it hit Bill in the face and killed him in a matter of minutes, but Richard was still screaming when the police arrived two hours later.The acid ate away at the bed and the floor, the police found dead Bill and his screaming partner Richard on the first floor, with a giant hole in the ceiling above them.It was on every news channel and website, and an interesting thing happened.See, when you have the prospect of eternal life, and eternal beauty, drugs and sex get boring after a while, and Im sure that many of the Immortals had the idea of torture, but now it was popular.It started out with people going out into the streets, wearing protective equipment, stabbing people just to watch their acid blood slowly eat away at them, crowds would gather to watch, the screams echoing through the cafe patios and store fronts.Body armor even came into fashion, but even that began to bore people.Life needed an element of danger, theres nothing worth living for, nothing thats really enjoyable if there isnt risk or danger involved.Torture clubs, or dinner parties as we usually call them, have become quite popular.When you first arrive you write your name on a slip of paper and place it into a hat, after dinner a name is drawn, the host doesnt read it out loud, instead what follows is this strange game, almost like duck\-duck\-goose.The host walks around the room, pointing the knife at the guests, and then, quickly thrusts it into whoever was chosen.We sit and watch as the slow burning of the acid eats away at one of our friends, we typically eat dessert as they scream.Then those of us that want to stay for an orgy take some drugs and fuck near our friend, the sound of the screams, the threat of rolling over into the acid only heightens the experience.Ive even heard of some people stabbing themselves, jerking off as the acid eats away at them, like auto\-erotic\-asphyxiation, but for a new, strange generation.Empathy and morals seem like ancient concepts, forgotten by all but those who stumble upon the words in a dictionary.It seems like peoples desires get stranger and more dangerous every day.I cant imagine what life will be like in another fifty years, of course, its only a matter of time before my name is chosen.
