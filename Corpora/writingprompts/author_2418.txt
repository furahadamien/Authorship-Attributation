As I heave the 20mm auto-cannon into place I go over my plan, flawless, yet simple; create nuclear diversion immediately after capturing Lois.Couldn't be more simple.Now to watch as the bait brings the flies, Superman won't know what hit him."Ahh, Lois Lane."I say to myself."Superman's kryptonite...Except for kryptonite of course, but that's not to worry.We have both!"I give a warm hearty chuckle looking down from my scope for a second.I quickly straighten up, putting my eye back in the cup."Can't be getting lazy now, so close to the finish line."I check the status of my motion sensors; all green."Just a matter of time."Seconds later I hear an explosion above my head as the sky tries to turn it's self inside out.Superman hovers slowly to the ground in the clearing that I had placed Lois into.BANG!Explosions engulf Superman and Lois, atomized Kryptonite instantly immobilizes Superman, having it covering the inside of his lungs he is rendered mortal.The second the smoke clears thunderous explosions ring out.The ground where Superman had been is shredded by the auto-cannon in a hail of deafening explosions."That bastard will never host his goddamn monster mash in our city ever again... YOU HEAR ME YOU GODDAMN MONSTER?What?Did you think you were a god?That you could fucking decide who lives and who dies?Like we're your goddamn subjects that you can slaughter and torture to your will?YOU CANT HURT ME ANYMORE YOU MISERABLE FUCK!Or anyone else for that matter."I don't feel better, maybe I never will, But revenge was sweeter than anything I've had recently.So I think I'm going to go find me some more.
