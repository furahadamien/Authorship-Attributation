The man behind the counter froze in the middle of typing out my order.They looked up at me wide eyed and said,"Nobody's spoken that language in thousands of years."Sounding somewhat surprised.That night, standing in the empty 24/7 McDonald's of our small desert town, it finally happened.The thing that I had been waiting for for my entire life, and had a feeling would happen eventually."Shit.You're an alien?"I said more worried about making a good impression than running away.They responded with a look of 'are you kidding me' before dryly stating "what else would I be?"and they quickly regained their compsure.I was struggling to hold back my enthusiasm.They did not seem as amused by the encounter and they were actually starting to get concerned."Uh... Is everything alright there?You look like you are about to piss yourself."They went back to typing.My mind ran at a thousand miles an hour, as the cashiers words flew over my head."Oh my God!Is the name on your tag your real name?How'd you get here?Wait how long have you lived here?I mean in this town not just, you know, on the planet. "This went on for about half an hour.It stopped when the cashier stuffed a burger in my mouth while I was lost in the nervice tidal wave.They said a single word " Eat."and that was that.I sat down at a table and began to nibble away at my fries.The cashier disappeared around a corner for a minute or so before returning to sit across from me.The taste of food suddenly reminded me that I had forgotten to have lunch and dinner that day, due to getting cought up in fixing my car's engine.He sat down with the chair facing backwards to so he could lean forward with out touching the sticky table.He said "I don't know what the deal is with you, but I am going to have to ask where you learned to speak like that.Because you are obviously just one very confusing human being."While going to town on the burger I said "don't know.I was sort of born with this weird super power to communicate really fucking well.Almost like mind reading but without the mind reading.I honestly don't know what language I am speaking in most of the time unless somebody either tells me or they say something very specific to that tounge."I stop to drink a sip of soda.The cashier, whom I just then noticed had 'Stanly' on his name tag, showed a visable confusion drawn on to his face like a sudden migraine.He muttered something.He muttered 'God damn it, Jax I told you not to go sleeping around.'I think.Muttering isn't an exact language.Stanly sighed and asked "would there by any chance be a rumour in your family that somebody anybody met an alien?"I finnished off my burger not fully grasping the situation, "Not that I know of.Why?"Stanly mumbled to himself again and said " I don't have any easier way to break the news to you, kid.Someone in your family line has... engaged in some cross breeding."I choked on my drink, "what?!"Stanly continued "Your powers are a knockoff version of my races abilities to process information.""I just thought I had autism."I guess this was not Stanly's best night.He paused to figure out what to say next.He then hesitantly said " I wouldn't... rule that out entirely.The weight of this really doesn't seem to be, um... Regestaring correctly."I gave an understanding nod an said "Ya, that tends to happen a lot.I'm getting better though."(I only realised two days later that I had been drinking my soda very obnoxiously. )I drank some more of my sprite.Stanly tried to get back on track.He said "Right... How would you like to meet your something far back grandfather?"
