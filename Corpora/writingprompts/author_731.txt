*How many weeks has it been now since I've gone on the run?Five?Ten?*

It felt like an eternity, but it hardly mattered - it wouldn't change anything.The FBI had been called in not long after the tenth kill, and after that my face had become the most well known in the entire country.I can't go anywhere without the risk of being recognized by someone, and that just makes me sick.*I can't even save my friends in other countries at this rate!What am I supposed to do?!Had I known what would happen when I was given this damn knife, would I still have accepted it?*

The sound of tires against a wet road passed like a whisper above my head, the overpass providing temporary shelter in the black of that night following the eleventh kill - the eleventh save.Rainy nights were the preferred time to rescue loved ones now, that way I wouldn't have to feel their blood on my hands for long, and the scent of copper wouldn't turn my stomach.A serial killer, sure, but one that could barely handle the burden upon their shoulders.As the rain pounded down, I glanced to the opening of the overpass to gaze upon what looked like a barrier blocking the world out from the aftermath of another save.Another death.Which one was it anyway?Both?That hurt my brain to try and comprehend, and hurt my heart to think too long about.Rain, it was a calming sound.The soft symphony of the earth as it wept over its fate, a fate that was caused by the infection called the human race as it greedily took all she had to give, and demanded more still.I watched the blood from the body at my feet snake ever closer to the cleansing waters rushing down from the skies above.Washing away my sin before my very eyes as I followed the smell of copper to stand before the cool, vertical rapids.It was cold across my skin, as my hand extended to break apart the blanket of water, washing the crimson from me.*As if it never happened* I thought with a tired, and bitter smile.Soon, all the evidence would be gone and I'd have to move base again, promising to myself that the last time would be coming soon.Through the gap made by my slender fingers, I could see the stars in the black sky above, and felt the warmth of a tear slip down my cheek.Just a few more, until I could go too.The notorious serial killer would soon become a hero.Just a few more.Rain, it washes away even the darkest of sins.
