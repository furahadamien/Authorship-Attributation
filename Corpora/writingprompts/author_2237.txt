"Sir, we can confirm what the Blorgian scanners have already shown us.There are ruins down there.Big ones," exclaimed Under Commander Artexi, waving a tentacle frantically."Let the drop team know we will be releasing the Under Carriage for insertion then.And for Glarph's sake stop waving that tentacle.Shipwoman Ipoctao already thinks you want to mate with her, and if you keep that up she will spear you with her beak in the next few fragomores," the Captain said.It wasn't joking.An old Squid had the advantage of being sexless, but Ipoctao was desperate to procreate at only fifty-four, and Artexi was young enough to attract any mating age Gloperine female.Since the SkyGazer Clan had determined that the Ancient of Ancients, the oldest known race in the universe had originated from this rather indistinct little yellow star system, the Great Council had ordered an Exploration.Captain Hgorla was pleased to have the lead ship, and as such, none of the other Partex (a group of five hundred Gloperine Water Ships) ships could send out their Under Carriages filled with anxious Science Squids until his had touched down and made an initial report."Under Carriage away.Drop in progress.Atmosphere is as thin as predicted, Captain but the heat shield is nominal.," reported Artexi.The Under Carriage made its drop pretty much on the attack vector Hgorla had approved.It was pleased.The specific ruin was mostly buried under the strange vegetation of this world.It was odd looking at a world of sentient beings that wasn't covered in water.They had oceans, yes, but almost a third of the visible mass was above the level of the seas.The Blorgian scanners had confirmed that there were no ruins fully immersed, no evidence these Ancients had ever lived solely under the water.It was unnatural, thought Hgorla, but it's people had met other races who lived this way.Ah well, it's immediate work was done, time for a nice massage."You have the command, Artexi," said the Captain as it thrust itself through the water towards his Ship Cave._______________________________________________________

The decision made, the Under Carriage landed on the edge of the water near one of the great ruin's tallest towers.Of course, it was mostly fallen and covered in vegetation, but the Blorgian readouts were clear.Under that mess of surface plants were the remains of a once great civilization."Now, make sure your suits are properly sealed.We don't want to lose water while we do our immediate survey," whistled out Thinker Blaicjni.Having been chosen to be the lead Fact Finder, it would not allow anything as clumsy as a death from suffocation to mar his efforts."Everyone set?""Confirmed, all set," whistled back Under Thinker Hrongat.She checked the straps on each one of the four Thinkers that was assigned with her.Blaicjni was a droll old squid but it was brilliant too.If it hadn't already gone into the neutral age of their species, she might have been tempted to pierce him once or twice.The outer doors opened and the dry heat and light atmosphere of the planet filled the cargo area.Hrongat saw one of the younger Thinkers shudder and remembered her first time stepping onto a world above water.Sympathetically she inched out a tentacle and tapped him gently."Let's go, Loperi, we haven't got all Morgath," she encouraged.The party walked carefully down the ramp and waded towards the target building.She could see on the portable Blorgian she carried that their entry point was about two thirds up the total height of the remains.If Glarph was playing the bones today, the rest of the building below their entrance would be submerged.Walking on dry was acceptable, but she always relaxed a little when they were safely under.Sure enough, a little work with their high pressure water tools cleared the vegetation and opened the building up.It was dark inside, but they had brought plenty of light.Blaicjni went first, as was his right, then she followed and the rest of the Thinkers jostled for position behind her.The inside of the building was dry.Hrongat saw Blaicjni hesitate, then with a firmness she didn't share, he set out towards the center of the building."How is this possible?"asked Loperi."This building is beyond ancient.Beyond anything we know.Surely the sea, the pressure, the vegetation, something would have breached it before us?"Hrongat was about to answer when Thinker Blaicjni stopped her with a single whistle."No.Do not speculate.Let us move in, and down and see if we can find a rational explanation for what now appears unreasonable," it demanded.They continued to the center where they found a great staircase.It was clearly designed for a method of propulsion different than that used by even land based Gloperines, were there such a thing.The descent was wide, but with short drops of less than half a tentacle's length.It was awkward following it down, an awkwardness that increased with each level of descent.Blaicjni called for more light, so everyone turned on their suit lights.Gloperines evolved in shallow waters, and their cities were built on mountains in their oceans.As their first explorations were to the depths of their own seas, bright light was something they did very, very well.The central staircase lit up below them.At the bottom was a large globe, held up by ancient figures.Hrongat trembled in excitement."Thinker," she said, "are those actual representations of the biological race who lived here?Are we seeing the form of the Ancients?""Don't assume," Thinker Blaicjni rebuked her."They could be pets, or fantastical beings as art, for all we know."Hrongat wasn't so sure.The bipedal beings that stretched their arms up to hold the Great Globe seemed too representative to be anything but the builders themselves.She walked over to one and, without thinking of anything but how beautiful it was, gently touched it.A blast of pressure knocked her across the room.She could see Blaicjni and the rest of the team had been pushed back as well.Suddenly, the Great Globe began to move, and filled with light.Terrified, she did what any sensible Squid would do.She released a blast of black ink.In spite of her training, her education, instinct formed over a millions of years of evolution took over and a primal part of her reacted instantly.Fortunately, the suits were designed with that contingency in mind and her response was gently contained in the lower suit, without anyone else being the wiser.The light increased in volume then to her astonishment, a beam shot out from the globe and encompassed everyone in the room.She felt as if her insides were being gently tickled, then as swiftly as it started, it stopped.Water began rushing in from all sides.Not enough to hurt anyone, but she could see that the building was filling, as if accommodating the nature of those who now stood there.Within seconds, the room was full, a natural light played across the globes and settled."What in Glarph's seven hells did you do, you moron?"demanded Thinker Blaicjni."Nothing.Well, not nothing.I just touched it for a second," she stammered out.As Blaicjni was about to lay into her the Blorgina on her tentacle sent out an alert.It was quickly followed by alerts from the Blorginas on everyone's else's suits as well."Thinker, fast movers.Dozens.Maybe hundreds?"she hesitated."Where?"it demanded."Everywhere," she cried.The room was suddenly full of some kind of strange fish.It was long, and slim, bigger than a Gloperine adult in the prime years, but not quite as big as Thinker Blaicjni.They were emitting strange sounds, so on a hunch, Hrongat turned on her translation port."Welcome, welcome, welcome.Hello!Hello!No fear.Peace.And welcome," they shouted as they danced around her and the team._____________________________________________________

"Captain, please return to the bridge," whistled Artexi through the intership communicator.Within the space of a few fragos the bulky Captain squeezed into the bridge."Report," it demanded."Captain, please, this is Under Thinker Hrongat," the communicator whistled out."What?Where is Thinker Blaicjni?What in Glarph's name are you doing reporting?"The Captain was more confused than angry."Um, Thinker Blaicjni is huddled into himself," Hrongat began.The Captain and the bridge crew were shocked.Only the most terrifying, life threatening event could cause that reaction.As calmly as it could, the Captain whistled, "Continue your report."Hrongat described the descent, the machine they had found and then the resulting appearance of the fast movers.Speaking slowly, as she suspected every ship in the Partex and perhaps even the Great Council would soon hear her report, she continued."They call themselves Dolphini, Captain.The Ancients set them a task.'Watch and wait' they were commanded, 'until the globe calls you.'They said they have been waiting billions of Fragmites and  are nearly unable to contain their joy that the Globe has come alive.Their words, Captain," she said."So?What does that mean to us?Why is Thinker Blaicjni so...well, why?"The Captain was afraid it knew."They said," Under Thinker Hrongat said carefully, "That the Globe didn't just wake up to recognize a sentient species.It also woke up the billions upon billions of Ancients who have been suspended in something they call "black holes" waiting to come out.They said the Ancients were lonely.So they prepared their machines and hid.And waited.Until now."In the center of the galaxy, held by forces impossible for the Gloperine science to even imagine, great powers began to shift, as the alarm clocks of fifty billion human beings woke them from their long nap.
