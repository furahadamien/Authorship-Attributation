"Just fucking kill it, Michael.i'm tired of you and your ~they are harmless~ shitty philosophy" she said before smashing the door on her way out.That was the last time i heard of her in months.I was never the perfect boyfriend, but i always gave my best, always tried to improve, i guess i wasn't good enough for her, or for that job, or my family.I guess i just wasn't good enough for anything really.Maybe i tried too hard to be good with everyone else, but i wasn't good with myself.I didn't deserve it probably, i was just a jobless dude with no future, no idea of what he was doing and a lack of will.Maybe i never deserved to be happy.Afterall i just throwed away my relationship for a little 8 legged dude that never did anything for me.Na, it wasn't their fault, it was mine, i shouldn't even be here, i don't have any purpose.Probably the best thing i did was saving it and her friends and letting them go in the garden, i saved them and Mary got free of me, now she can be happy.I went to the kitchen, grabbed a bottle of whiskey that i was saving for a special ocation, what's more special than the end?Poured a glass and went to the bedroom, reached the .38 from the back of the highest shell from the wardrobe."Aah, what a pitty the use i'll give it, i should've gone to the field, at least to shoot some cans.Guess my father won't be proud of this either."I thought as i looked at the only heritage off my father.I drank a last sorb of that old whiskey and put the gun in my head.I took a last breath and placed the finger in the trigger, but it was sticky and hard.I looked at the gun surprised, there was a bunch of spiders there, making a web around the trigger and the gun.I couldn't understand what was going on."not now little fellas" i said as i grabbed and putted them in the wardrobe.But they kept comming, the floor, the ceiling, even the inside of the gun, from everywhere.I fell in the bed shocked.They were filling the gun in webs, i felt a sting in the hand that made me drop the gun.I tryed to grab it again, but the gun started to move with hundreds of spiders beneath it."I just want to end it, plis" i said, with a knot in my throat.I heard a noise, a voice, comming from the bed, "Mickey?Are you okey?", It was my mom on the phone that was in top of the pillow, "Mickey?You are scarying me honey".I grab the phone, shaking, 
"hey mom, sorry, can you come over?"I said crying."On my way, honey, wait me there".As i put my phone away i look at the room full of spiders.In the bed, they looked like they were arranged so i got up and looked again, they were forming letters, a phrase."Today u".
