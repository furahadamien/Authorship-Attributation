Ed remembers trotting through puddles the size of lakes.Fur soaked of oily city rain, downpours so heavy you could barely see beyond the next street.Alleyways were his homes, flea-covered garbage his beds, and the scampering rodents his meals.His bones ached.They ached with the cold seeping wet, the hard asphalt digging into his scarred paws, the booted kicks of angry chefs shooing him away, savory steaks and sumptuous breads wafting from the doorways into his snot-crusted snout.They ached with loneliness.And the constant dark.His dirt-matted fur sloughed off in clumps, a reminder of where he'd already been, and where not to go, until the next day's rain washed the map away.Ed lived a simple life.He found a nice place to lie down for longer than a night.A nice little park near the edge of town, a sunset creek flowing lazily nearby.He contemplated jumping into the river and drowning.Ed limped across the grass and looked at the sparkling water, clearer than anything he'd seen all his life.Laying down, he reconsidered, basking in the warmth of the sun.Eyes closed, he dreamed of the blue sky and birds chirping and a young man petting him softly, so softly.He dreamed.
