Magic does not give its boon without a sacrifice.The greater the request, the greater the price.Not that we realized it was magic at first.We all know how indistinguishable it is from sufficiently advanced science, especially when you don't believe in magic.Especially when men in lab coats tell you it's the fruit of all the scientific research your tax dollars have paid for.Especially when you know exactly how the damn stuff works.How it works.Not what it does.We all know about the synthetic telomeres, the cellular reconstruction, the genetic changes.We know how it slows the process of aging down until you're basically immortal.How children born into a world of agelessness would never physically leave their twenties.And we, who were just too old to stop forever, never quite bothered to count the cost.My early twenties were some of the dumbest years of my life.And the ageless people who now control the world will never leave theirs.Magic always demands a price.
