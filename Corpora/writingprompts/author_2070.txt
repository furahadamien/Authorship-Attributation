So the galactic counsel creates the transcendence initiative to preserve as many sentient souls as possible by digitalizing consciousness and uploading them into a virtual world.However, only the central nervous system can currently be preserved, and deaths continue occur in an unpredictable manner.Live hosts are still at risk of spontaneous death, where only the sturdiest of heart still offer their minds in the effort to digitalize consciousness.Those fearful of death and who wish to stay alive volunteer their organic bodies to be cryogenically frozen, until the initiative is complete.Those demanding a deeper resolve for justice from this indefensible reaping of innocent lives, tirelessly brave against death itself to reach the truth.Scouts and researchers task themselves about the galaxy to determine the cause of this phenomenon.In the end, will it matter if the cause is stopped?Or, is it better if lives can be saved in this new digital haven?Can there be a future for life in the galaxy?--

Thousands of years pass.Sentient life as it is known has taken new form, sans organics.Consciousnesses are instanced into cybernetic bodies, retaking physical form.Death has become a theoretical myth.The future is cold.Planets once vividly exuberant with life are covered in metal and glass.Other celestial bodies have been mined to their cores to build trillions of siphons around stars, concentrating their energy into beams that span the cosmos.There is little reason to rely on biological platforms, except for aesthetic purposes - for the few who still have appreciation for it.A new webway allows explorers to traverse the galaxy without risk to one's own life.Individuals can upload themselves and travel the webway across networks of stars as packets of data, or may explore the physical in a remotely fabricated body.This new reality has protected life, and given it a way to prosper.It has made the irreplaceable, permanent.But in gaining immortality, is consciousness still valuable?
