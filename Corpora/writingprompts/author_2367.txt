In my final moment, I wish I had left long ago, before I could hurt her so deeply.I think that if I had been less selfish I could have spared her heartache and loneliness.But I did not think to save someone who cannot die.Neither of us understood how or what happened, but ever since the lightening struck us I have been out of time, jumping forward randomly.Every time, landing on the shore of the bay.And every time, Mia is there.If I am a man out of time, she is a woman stuck in it.No matter the time I'm gone, she remains the same.Each time I make the trek to our home, everything changes.Huts are replaced with houses.Roads go from dirt to rock.Men trade horses and donkeys for cars.But Mia is the same.I walk the road to our home, and usually find her working in the garden.She hears me coming from far away, and the moment she does, she runs to me.I  open my arms and scoop her up, and she cries tears of joy.She tells me how long she's been waiting.A year, a week, ten years, a day.It is always different.We go into our home, and resume our life together.We live a life filled with love.But then, as always, I will close my eyes.When I open them, I will be on the shore of the bay again.I walk the road to our home, noting the changes around me.Each time, it takes a little longer for Mia to notice me coming.But each time, she runs to me all the same, and cries her tears of joy.I walk the road to our home, and begin to notice that before Mia hears me, she is motionless.She sits in her garden, but does not move.She is like a statue, until she hears me.The more I travel, the longer it takes Mia to notice me.The longer it takes her to notice me, the more I notice that she remains still.Until she hears me, she is lifeless.I begin to understand that as she is my whole life, I am hers.While I am traveling forward, she waits.While I travel, she does not live.I walk the road to our home, and Mia does not notice me.I kneel beside her and stroke her back.She comes back from wherever she goes when I am not there, and jumps in to my arms crying tears of joy.She tells me she has been waiting for more than 40 years.She's lost count.I walk the road to our home, and Mia does not notice me.I go into our home, as quietly as I can.I grab what I need and go back outside to Mia.I kneel beside her and stroke her back.She comes back to me, and jumps into my arms, but I am not strong enough to hold her.We both fall down.As she cries her tears of joy, I tell her that I can't bare for her to not live her life while she waits for me.I tell her not to wait anymore.I begin to go.I tell her I love her.I tell her to live.
