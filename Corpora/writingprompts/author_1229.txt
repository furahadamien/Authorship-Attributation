Tired.Neutral.A little bit tipsy.I scrolled through Reddit, my turn in and slow down ritual for the last few years.Tonight was a little different, being Christmas and all that jazz.Topics seemed to show up at a slower rate, and tended towards wholesome and happy.In a word, boring.I suppose excitement is in the eye of the beholder as they say.Wait, who says?I've gone and conflated the meaning of saying again, good one dumbass.Never get anything right.Stupid, stupid, stupid.What's this?A wild thread appears!"You are loved and accepted for who you are.I hope you have the opportunity to have a happy holiday season, and a great new year!"I'd forgotten what it was like to have my heart skip a beat, sort of how it would feel when Mary Sue would look at me with those big brown doe eyes.The way her curves would just slide through the air like a graceful dancer effortlessly demonstrating the tango to a prospective group of students, all the while making each and every individual there feel like they were the center of her attention - had I not lived it I would to this day still scoff at most alliteration as over the top and ridiculous.My mouth is parched, it's been at least a few minutes since the last sip, the tumbler is three quarters full and Woodford Reserve is just such a smooth spirit for such a cheap price that it would be a shame to let it sit unattended for too long.The link pops out at me as I feel the slow burning of tonight's spirit within me.Fine, I'm game, let's see what happy go lucky sentiments we have flowing through our collective pysche tonight.*Click.*

Typical, the title text is it and there's nothing more to it than that, why do I waste my time with this?Well, I suppose of all things, I have time.This thread is as good a place as any to spend it.My instincts say that the topic title is clear and unambiguous but a gut wrenching feeling is gnawing at me, a feeling that I've only felt a few times before - LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!On stage and feeling like a fool, stumbling through lines and missing scene prompts.Blood pressure spikes, jaw tenses and eyes narrow.Accepted?Loved?How incredibly presumptious and self serving, is this OP completely incapable of facing the realities of life?*It's possible to make all the right moves and still lose the game*.Not that I made the right moves or that life is a game.The dregs of the glass of bourbon whiskey are imbided with gusto and the fire within is renewed.A face stares back at me from the screen, gradually reddening and seeming uglier with anger and bitterness with every passing moment.It's almost 2018, and here I am ready to type - where are my Ghost in the Shell expandable typing fingers when I need them most?The cursor is moved over "Reply" but the imminent click of the mouse is interrupted by the colour and light of a mobile phone screen turning off, as if it was just activated by a far away touch that inevitably gave up when it got nothing back.For fucks sake, I was so engrossed in my own thoughts I missed a call, best see what this is about."Hey there!Keen for a cheeky dinner?"My mind spirals, it's out of control.What a mess."Me?"Relieved laughter escapes my lips - obviously they meant a different Wookie and this is a classic case of phone fat fingering.Thank god!Memories fight their way against the rip tide of my will and I realise with a sickening jolt that I just told the literal only person to reach out to ask to see me on a special day in the last 10 years to fuck off.The Italian double walled tall glass stares back at me mockingly once I've slammed back most of it's refreshed contents, daring me to go for another refill.Rage boils up in me in a manner that I've been able to keep under lock and key for years though things are very different this time.Instead of anger reaching it's ultimate crescendo as per past out of control situations, tears flow and anxiety skyrockets.My soul has finally succumbed to effects of the empty platitudes and broken promises of healthily social people.&gt; I hope you have the opportunity to have a happy holiday season, and a great new year!Get's me every time, reading between the lines.Better get good at it, because that's what life is about kid.&gt; I hope you have the opportunity to have a happy holiday season (so long as I don't have to put up with you), and a great new year (just make sure you don't bother us popular people)!How on earth can some goddamn text on a screen affect me so?Who the hell is the OP???/u/Muslim_Wookie

[Apologies for the stilted writing and poor prose, I'm not a creative writer and this is my first ever WP response (likely last tbh), and I just decided to post whatever my hands wrote.I kept forcing myself to stop thinking ("I wonder what will resonate with the readers and make this a popular post") and just write and post whatever flowed out.I haven't gone back through and edited for typos etc because I'm shit at that.]
