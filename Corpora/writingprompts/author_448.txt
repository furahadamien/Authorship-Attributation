I was a child when the bombs dropped.Great flashes of light consumed the sky with dragons breath,  upon the ground remained shattered and charred remnants of those happy memories of youth since past.World War III had come, and with it, the great exodus.The war pasted mere months before what remained of the powers that be convened upon the island of Florida, ground zero, to peace talks.The population of the world had been decimated, over 700million people perished in the blazes that consumed them.Florida, at one time was a peninsula, but the devastation caused great portions to be sent skyward, filling in great craters with vast amounts of irradiated waters.In an effort to ensure no further loss of life they gathered, pomp and circumstance abounded.In the end, they agreed to 50 years of isolation, the annexation of Alaska by Canada, no less, and Hawaii... Well, it sank into the sea.They were given 10 years to build a wall around the 48 states, and were forced into demilitarization.Trade deals would be handled by the pricate sector, but only for raw materials.The internet went dark in the first few weeks of the war, so no one could reach the outside world if they wanted to.The walls were raised, and the world, forgotten.Our world became infinately smaller.Inside the concrete walls we flourished.Even before the war one of our most abundant resources was crops, only now, we innovated.Farmlands were transformed into grasslands in order to promote water tables in our interior.We then used this water to create new means of food production at the local levels.Aquaponics allowed us to grow upward, instead of outward, meaning most towns could feed themselves.Toward year 30 our aged electrical grid was replaced with massive power banks spread throughout the country, connected to wind and solar farms.Power outages were a thing of the past.Oil production was ceased as our pipelines were largely destroyed during the conflict.Cars, no longer exist, aside from the occasional junk yard find.Rather, with 600 billion dollars a year going unspent on military, we innovated.Rather than our antiquated highway systems, we built railways, and bullet trains.To go from the Old LA memorial to the Island of Florida only takes a matter of a day on an express route.The world of yesteryear is but a memory now.Alas, isolationism came to a crashing hault in year 46.The walls north of New York and Maine came under bombardment.Not from bombs, or bullets, but from people.Our walls were built 150 feet tall, and over 60 feet thick at it's base, with a retention wall surrounding it.Water levels had increased dramatically in those 56 years since the war had ended.Boats filled with people amassed at our shores daily.With them, came word of the world without us.For nearly 60 years the effects of global warming had become apparent, many large cities were now under water.Much of mainland Europe was now an archipelago, Africa was mostly intact but closed its borders from further refugees fleeing the EU.It seemed daily boats would arrive on the west coast as well, filled with people fleeing their sinking  homes.South America and China suffered similar fates, as did Japan and most of Austrailia.The United States,  was largely intact due to the massive walls built half a century before.Millions flocked to our borders only to be turned away.Our goverment's solution?Thicker walls.That was four years ago.Now the borders are to open, and what will we find?
