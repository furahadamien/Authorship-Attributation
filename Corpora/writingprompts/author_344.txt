"Hey thanks, I hope you have a good afternoon"

The swirling void took me by surprise, really.The crimson red eyes of the cashier, not so much.I'd seen it before, I thought.Glimpses and glances, really; bad punctuation as a coda to the overbearing sentence of ordering a Whopper."We don't sssserve Whoppers," she hissed, hissingly.She was a she.And she didn't like what she heard.The tail hadn't struck my eyes, but now it was striking my face.In a very feminine, demonic way at McDonald's.I thought about all the times I'd made children smile with a wink, a nod, an utterance I barely understood in a language I must have butchered around the world.Airports, ESL classes, daycares... something had always touched me.It was too late though.The room melted away like guess on an SAT analogy I'd glazed over.Never enough time.Never enough time.A feminine body curled snakishly and femininely atop me, a forked tongue darted in and out, the sound a hiss but the words I heard:

"If you 'Go Looking' for your Lovecraft book in the ball pit again I'm calling the fucking cops."
