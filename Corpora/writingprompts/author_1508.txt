It made no sense why I would be here.A place that no sane person would be.Alone in the dark.Surrounded by the bones of those long passed away lit only by the flickering firelight of my torch.But I knew my mission in this crypt.The rapidly approaching night that would seep into this place coaxing its inhabitant out of its slumber.I also knew that would likely bring more death to the manor above and the small town below.The frantic message from the township was clear ...any price but before tomorrow night... news of the demise of the much maligned mayor had started me on the way.Not that I had cared for the offical but rather the news of his grisly and unusual death and the ensuing panic had caught my attention.The Mayor had been holding another extravagant dinner in the manor.Mid-speech he was struck with a rigor and then rose like a marionette being lifted by its strings into the air.Some guests screamed, others shifted in their seats unsure if this was part of some elaborate dinner theatre.But what happened next left them in no doubt as the Mayor was cast violently to the table.Wine and food cascaded from every edge while the Mayor was pinned to the table spreadeagled.His clothes tore from him leaving red welts where they rubbed raw against his skin.Those that hadnt already fled rose to their feet in horror as the Mayor mouthed a stifled scream.Then every metal object in the room rose to the ceiling.There was a deathly quiet.Then every fork, knife, and coin in the room embedded itself into the exposed body of the now dead Mayor.I had heard of, and even seen, things like this myself although seldom so violent.It was unavoidable in my line of work.Since the rot took my arm it was all I could do.Hunting poltergeists until I succumbed and became one myself.I prolonged my life with a balm while searching for the cure.But that could only work for so long and the balm ingredients are expensive.This means putting myself into these situations to battle the poor souls who had been overwhelmed by the rot and consumed driven into a violent rage and a ethereal existence.Their first kill normally relates to the righting of a perceived wrong.But the kill triggers an insatiable thirst which increases each night in intensity and ferocity keeping the spirit earth bound and only allowing peace long after the last human has flown from the surrounding areas.The townspeople didnt bargain.They agreed and signed the contract faster than any group before them.Id arrived with a few hours till sunset making sure that they wouldnt have time to barter me down.A lesson Id learnt from too many lean prizes for too much risk.The information they gave me caused me to wonder if I should have asked for more.I couldnt manipulate my surroundings like the poltergeists but in their presence my arm reappears in its spectral form allowing me to battle them singlehandedly.Something about the impact of my ghostly arm causes the poltergeists to weaken and succumb to the eternal rest.It does also feed my rot.Which has worryingly progressed up my right bicep towards the shoulder.The last battle was more of a non-event.The poltergeist had only killed its former dog before I stumbled across it.I wondered what that poor mutt had done to deserve the wrath of its former owner but was thankful the geist was weak enough to be dispatched without too much cost.The meagrely reward had left me desperately short of the most expensive ingredients for the balm; the last of which I had to apply after the battle.So here I find myself.Stalking through the last known resting place of the only towns rot victim.The Mayors son.The person that had more reasons than most to hate a man that was reviled around the region.Waiting for the night to come.Waiting for the poltergeist to rise and to face what maybe my most fierce fight yet.
