"You're safe now," he says, looking at me with a knowing, stoic expression of heroism.&nbsp;  
My jaw drops.&nbsp;  
"It's frightening, I know," he continues, looking down at the bleeding pocket of leather, but I can't hear him.I kneel on the ground and gently caress the edge of the leather and the warm material follows my hand weakly, shuddering in pain.&nbsp;  
I stand.&nbsp;   
He's behind me, frowning a little like he's expecting some kind of congratulations or maybe a mini freak-out.I notice how sweaty he is.He's sweating through the damn trench coat.&nbsp;  
"Thanks," I say, then step towards him as my tail darts forward from behind me and presses him to the wall by his throat.That wipes the superior smile off his face.I grin, showing my fangs, "But you really aught to be more careful given your line of work."&nbsp;  
I have lunch.&nbsp;  
When I return to my wallet, I'm careful to wipe my hands clean of blood (a couch someone's left in the alley serves this purpose seeing as the rest of me is rather wet) before gently picking it up.The leather shudders a bit and I try to swallow.&nbsp;  
Sliding it gently into the front pocket of my jacket I start down the alley again with fucking determination.&nbsp;  
Nobody is going to die today.&nbsp;  
Well, maybe somebody, but that prick had it coming.
