Dear diary,

I think by 153rd time it was pretty clear that it was not my super power.Ok, so sue me, I'm a slow learner.But 154th time was the charm.I had it down to an art form.Every time before the time freeze, I would get this feeling, like a tingling sensation in my arms.And then time would stop.I was quite glad to know that ny boring life wasn't really boring anymore.The best thing that ever happened to me because of the Time Freeze(TM) was the accident I "did not" get into.In other words, a truck kind of almost hit me but apparently I did not get hurt because of the freeze.I think that is when I was grateful for whoever or whatever that was doing it.Because I realised, that you cannot get hurt in a freeze.And that my friends, opened a world of opportunities.You know that cycling trick you kind of always thought was cool to learn but then the too many failed attempts just kind of leaves you with broken bones?Well, I nailed it.... after about 50 Time Freezes.But there was one thing that this had given an opportunity to do.Get over my fear of heights.See, ever since I was a kid, I have had this unreasonable fear of heights.With my parents being divorced and my Mom living hundreds of miles away, it has become difficult to meet her.This is perhaps the only way to get over my fear.Dear diary,

I think my Mom would kill me if she knew the kind of stuff I have been getting upto.But!!This is the 50th jump of the roof of our apartment building.And I am completely unharmed.And my legs don't even wobble anymore before the jump.I think that's a great achievement.I literally do not feel any fear of heights anymore.I think I'm gonna get a ticket to see my Mom soon.Just gotta confirm that the fear really is gone a couple of more times........................

Sally could not read it anymore.There, in between the pages was a plane ticket to Detroit.She did not understand why her son had committed suicide.But as she realised, it was not a suicide.
