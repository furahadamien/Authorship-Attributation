Death can be sudden, like being hit by a train or in my case, being hit by a wave of radiation that instantly melts you like an Hershey bar in a hot car.It Wasn't all that pretty in all honesty, especially seeing my the flesh melt away from my bare hands.I thought it couldn't get worse from there, and while I technically was right, it didn't get worse, It definitely got pretty weird.Imagine what you would think a stereotypical little girls room would look like; pretty pink walls, Barbie dolls, crood crayon drawings, a nice collection of stuffed toys, and of course a little girl to live in it.She was a decently dressed one, had long blonde hair and some of the bluest eyes a person could ever see.She was setting up a nice little tea party for herself and whatever dolls and how ever many stuffed animals she could cram on them seats.Meanwhile, I was absolutely shocked at the strangeness of this situation.One second I was witnessing my own skin melting off and a second later here I am in a room with a little girl and her stuffed animals.She looked at me and smiled and asked "won't you join us, Mr.Woozy?""Am I in hell?Is this what hell feels like?Am I just gonna walk over there and all of the sudden this little girl is gonna turn into the devil himself?"I thought to my self as I shuffled closer to the chair."C'mon Mr. Woozy, don't be shy."She said.While I was on the verge on having the worlds worst mental breakdown, I took a seat on the small plastic chair and looked looked at her straight in her blue eyes and anxiously asked "W-where am I?""At my tea party of course!"She said "and a bit late in all honestly, but I guess that's what happens when you get your tail all caught up in knots, especially when trying to untangle them alone."she said."T-tail?"I asked "why of course, you're a weasel after all."I looked back at what seems to be a long, slim tail.White with multi colored polka dots scattered about.The rest of my body was the same."Oh no" I said."What's the matter?"She replied."I-uh feel a b-bit sick, is it ok i-if I can u-use the bathroom?"I said even more anxious than before?I eventually ran out of the room and saw a man, presumably her father and yelled for his attention, but the thing was that he couldn't hear me, and I guess he couldn't see me either cause he walked straight through me.I never felt so violated in my life.Was I ghost?Can this girl see dead people?Am I gonna make it in a top 10 list of paranormal hauntings by some weird sounding dude?Then it dawned to me that I was no ghost, I was her imaginary friend.It all made so much sense,the tea party, being an abstract version of an animal, only her being able to see and hear me I Was Hers.I return to the room and sit down once again."Are you feeling ok Mr.Woozy?""Why yes I am, now tell me what kind of tea we're having" I joyfully replied.Fin
