It was one of those surreal moments that you only get to experience once in life.Linda was working on the script for the next show when her phone began to buzz.Slowly at first, just a couple messages.Work friends, she thought.Thursday was always their night out for drinks, but she had been too busy tonight to join them.Then the buzzing became more rapid, until her phone began vibrating constantly on the bed.With a frown, she glanced at the messages that were popping up quickly, one after another.They were all from random numbers, all sending the exact same message.She scrolled through, just to make sure she wasn't missing something."It's a beautiful night tonight.Look outside."A frisson of fear ran down her spine.After a minute, the messages slowed down.Then a singular message, different from the previous ones."DO NOT LOOK OUT YOUR WINDOW."It was from her boyfriend, Jordan.Her mind reeled.This had to be some kind of joke.She'd been such a good girl.She never went to abandoned houses and never walked into creepy forests alone.She was always sure to lock her windows and doors at night.So with hesitant steps, she walked toward the dark curtain that was covering her window.Slowly, she reached out a hand and flicked off the lamp on her desk so that her room became pitch dark.It would help, at least, if whatever was out there couldn't see in.Then, she slowly slid open the curtain and peeked outside, expecting the worst.Perhaps a killer clown or a ghost.She squinted.Was that...Jordan?Without hesitating, she ran toward her bedroom door, throwing it open, and dashed down the steps of her apartment until she was at the bottom.There, she watched as her boyfriend was desperately trying to bring down the small hot air balloon that he had somehow managed to raise a little ways from her window.He glanced down at her, then ducked into the basket.She simply stood there, waiting for him to get down.When the balloon came close enough, she saw the sign plastered to the front, and burst out into laughter.On the front of the balloon, in large bold, flowery lettering, were the words: 

LINDA, WILL YOU MARY ME?When the hot air balloon touched down, Jordan climbed out, his face bunched up."I told them not to send the messages, but it was too late when I noticed the typo--I'm going to kill Erin by the way--and everyone has such quick reflexes-" 

Linda simply laughed and cut him off, throwing herself into his arms."The answer's yes, in case you were wondering."Jordan froze for a moment before he hugged her tight, lifting her up and spinning her around in the air.Then, huffing and puffing, he set her down, breaking out in a large smile as he gazed her windswept hair and freckles."Best girlfriend ever," he said softly."Best fiance ever," she corrected, and tilted his face so they could look at the moon together."You have great timing, by the way.It's a full moon tonight.""I meant to do that," he said, and kissed her on the forehead.Then he pulled out his phone."Mission success," he typed into the group chat, and ignored the kissy faces that flooded in.He would get revenge on Erin tomorrow, he vowed, his face dark.But at least, he thought, this would be a tale to tell the grandkids.*****

The man swirled into Kassidy's lab, his black cape flowing behind him.She barely gave him a glance before turning back to her computer.She still had to run the next batch of samples, and if she was even a tiny bit off with the timing, they would become useless.But she couldn't ignore him entirely, she supposed."What do you want?"she asked, then carefully set her vial down and placed the entire group of vials into the freezer.She stripped her gloves.Lucifer narrowed his kohl-rimmed eyes at her."You know very well what I'm here for."Kassidy shrugged."Not sure what you're talking about."He gritted his teeth and walked around the metal table until he was standing right in front of her.He slammed the newspaper down onto the table.Kassidy barely took a look at it before giving him a small smile."Well, congratulations to that little old lady, I suppose.Living until you're 120 years old is quite a feat."He wanted to kill her."Yeah, it would be quite an accomplishment," he said, his jaw clenching, 'if she weren't supposed to die two months ago."He pulled out his tablet and quickly typed in the lady's name, then flipped it around and showed her.On the screen, along with a picture of the elderly women, was the age at which she was supposed to die.Instead of a positive time ticking down towards her death, it was now negative."And I know you gave her that serum you concocted," he hissed."We had a deal."Kassidy raised an eyebrow."We did, in fact.And I am upholding my part of the deal splendidly well."His pale eyes flashed."You know immortality is not to be trifled with."Kassidy scoffed."Right.So only the Gods get it.Because I'm sure you guys clearly deserve it."Lucifer's lips narrowed into a thin line."I forgave that you drank the damn thing yourself.I granted you amnesty.You don't know how *angry* Fred was with me when I told him he couldn't take your soul and had to explain why.He threw a temper tantrum for three days straight, trained Cerberus to basically revolt against me, and then quit his job for a whole week."He paced around the table."People not dying for a whole week.Did you know the horror that caused?Gunshot wounds in stasis, people who should have bled out, dear lord, the number of newspapers I had to forcefully recall."He moaned, clutching his head in his hands."Half my minions are still on holiday because of the overtime."Then he raised his head."And now this.How many people have you given the serum to?"He opened the fridge and pulled out the vial with swirling amber liquid, smashing it against the floor.The liquid evaporated almost immediately upon contact with the air."Just a few," Kassidy said calmly.She shrugged off her lab coat.It looked like she wasn't about to get any more work done today.The last time Lucifer had paid her a visit, he'd stayed for three days and three nights."But I was actually thinking of selling it."Before he realized what he was doing, Lucifer unsheathed his claws, and they hovered inches from her face."Say that again."His tone was deathly calm.If she actually decided to sell the immortality serum, the entire world would be thrown into chaos.The other gods, who had slumbered since thousands of years ago, would finally awaken, and he would be put on trial for mishandling things.If things turned out badly, he might even be stripped of his title.And where would he be then?Kassidy didn't even blink at his threat.She was used to it by now."You're threatening the mother of your future child?"she asked, then turned around and grabbed her keys from the counter.At first, the question didn't register.Then Lucifer blinked.And blinked again.Mother of his...his eyes widened and flashed with something akin to joy.As much joy as he was capable of feeling, anyhow."You're pregnant?"he asked.His claws sheathed themselves, and he touched Kassidy's arm, turning her around."Since when?"She nearly rolled her eyes at him."Since three months ago.I was going to tell you, but you didn't respond, so I decided to take matters into my own hands."She shrugged.Hence the old lady.He couldn't even be mad at her now."But it's fine.Apparently you didn't think answering my summonings was important enough.So you can head back to Hell now."She walked towards the lab doors.She was mad.He was incredibly bad at reading emotions, but that much he knew."Kassidy, wait up!"he yelled, then followed her out like a puppy dog chasing after its owner.*****

"Hook, you've got to be mad to believe such a story!"Curtis Walsh, the captain of the precinct, clasped his hands together and sat back in his chair."You really expect the police to send resources over to investigate this kind of...madcap accusation made by a homeless person?""Sir, with all due respect, this isn't the first person who's made this accusation."Hook clenched his jaw to prevent himself from shouting."Multiple witnesses have come forth and said that--" 

"Said that this so called boy named 'Peter Pan'--which is a stupid made up name, by the way--has been addicting children to pixie dust?Children go missing all the time, Hook.We don't need some silly fairy tale explanation to make ourselves feel better about why it's true.That's not our department."He took off his glasses and set them on the table--his symbol to indicate the meeting was over."Sir, please--" 

"I mean it, Hook, drop the case.You lost your hand because last time you insisted on acting alone.I'm really sorry for you, and I tried to find the culprit.We all did.But I hope you've learned your lesson about going off half cocked."Hook's lips thinned into a line, his right hand subconsciously going to feel the smooth edge of the hook of his left hand.The doctor had said the unnatural shape of the cut made it impossible to easily put on another prosthetic and that he was better off with a hook.He'd never found who did it.But these missing children deserved a future, and he was going to give it to them, left hand or not.*** 

*"I think he's going after a little girl named Wendy tonight.He were laughin' about it goin' down the street earlier."* 

James Hook hid himself in the shadows, careful not to let himself show.He had no way of knowing whether Carly's tipoff would be accurate or not--that was really the risk that you took when trusting a homeless person for a source--but he had to give it a shot.It was his only clue right now to where Pan might show up next.216 Never Way Apt #207.He looked at the address once more before crinkling the slip of paper in his pocket.All he knew was that Pan was a wily one, and there were claims of him scaling the emergency ladders to get up into children's bedrooms without the parents knowing.Regardless, as long as he kept careful watch on the building's outside, he would be able to spot them.A whistled tune came from behind him.Hook hurriedly stepped further back into the alley, between two trash cans, where he was sure he wouldn't be spotted, angling his head to get a better view in the moonlight.He couldn't be certain, but the lanky hooded figure walking up to the building looked suspiciously similar in build to the information he'd been given.Without hesitating, Hook stepped forward, his camera out and ready.He needed evidence.He aimed toward the boy and clicked.Then hurriedly brought the camera down.Fuck.He'd forgotten to turn off flash.Fuck, fuck, fuck.He looked towards the figure, but they hadn't stopped.Hook took a deep breath.He was probably too far for them to have noticed.Thank god.He snapped a couple more pictures.He watched as the figure jumped and brought down the emergency ladder and clambered up.Hook's eyes narrowed.It had to be Pan then.The boy was far too adept at climbing the ladder to be anyone else.He moved closer, edging behind a car on the street.If he could get a clear picture of the boy's face, even just climbing up the ladder or coming down, then he'd have a case and Walsh would have to let him investigate further.The minutes ticked by after Pan disappeared into what he presumed to be apartment #207 on the second floor.Hook sat in silence, equally patient, his camera at the ready.After what felt like years, the window finally opened again, and Peter climbed down, the sound of his whistling shrill in Hook's ears.He shot as many photos as he could of the boy climbing down before dipping down and sitting with his back to the car, clutching the camera to his chest, his heart pounding.There had to be one good one in there.Pan had been looking down as he climbed, and this particular camera was very good at catching the light.A smile came to his face.All he had to do now was go back and look at the pictures.Hook felt a small tap on his shoulder.He turned his head to face a boy with blonde hair and beautiful, elegant features in a green hoodie.He hesitated at the unexpected appearance."Hey," the boy said with an innocent smile."You've got something of mine it seems."Then the smile vanished from his face as his dark brown eyes hardened and turned black."My photo."He brought up his hand and blew dust into Hook's face, blinding him temporarily.Then Hook felt the world fade to black.***
