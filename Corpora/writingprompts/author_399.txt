He watched, bored as people streamed in the bar, only stopping the ones underage, and occasionally a few just over to keep suspicions low.His kind was uncommon, and people
hunted for his power.It seemed like an odd thing to want, most just wanted it to make them feel *special*.At least, those that knew about it.Sometimes age didn't match up to looks, but he kept to his own, unless they were underage of course.But then *she* came along.As soon as the girl passed, his eyes flickered to the space above, knowing what he would see.The girl was likely 16, or 17, as was the guy with her.But she wasn't.1000 was her age, the one with her was 1001.This wasn't possible, but yet, that's what it said.Maybe it was wrong?But he'd NEVER been wrong before.As they passed he realized his mouth had been hanging open and he shut it reluctantly.A tap on his shoulder made him jump, but it was only the guy taking over next shift.Perfect.Making his way through the crowd he saw the girl heading into a storage room with a 18year old, different from whom she came with.He shook his head, about to leave when a silvery glint caught his eye.The boy was nearby, a knife in his hand.The girl disappeared, the other following suit.Breath catching, he hurried over, sure he would be greeted with a bloodbath.The door shut behind him and he looked around.In the darkness he saw the pair fighting the young man, backing him against the wall."Jonathan, will you do the honour?"He laughed in reply and stepped up, twirling a silver bladed dagger in his fingers.He laughed and drove the blade straight through the heart.Black blood flowed from the wound and the boy seemingly folded in on himself, disappearing all except for the puddle of black on the ground."Welcome to the world of the lightbringers, young one.We have long searched for one with a gift like yours, it will be quite useful.That is, if you don't mind joining us.Hunting demons is much better with more people involved, especially with talent like this.Let's get started, shall we?"
