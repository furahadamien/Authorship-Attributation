I froze up, my go-to whenever anything significant happens in my life."Yeah, well, that kid's mom gave him such a whooping for it, we *all* learned a lesson!"Stupid joke.That's my other go-to.I was about to apologize for it when I realized: she's catatonic.Her eyes fixed on nothing a couple inches over my left shoulderI don't think she was even breathing."Dude, what did you *say* to her?"I swung around.The guy behind me was about 6'2" and thin, with short, dark hair, and he was wearing a suit with some sort of conference nametag that said "Charles Anderson."I pored over it for what, at least to me, was just a couple seconds.It also said **2018 / "BE COURAGEOUS!"** I wish I was making this stuff up."What did you *say*?"It wasn't Charles.Charles was looking squarely above the whole debacle, hand on his chin, eyes hopping between what were probably the "**2: Quarter Pounder**^() with cheese" and the "**3: Double Quarter Pounder**^() with cheese."*Thank God for Charles,* I thought.If everyone in the world were like Charles, it would be so much better for me.I could just go about my day unnoticed, even with this new...quirk."What did you *fucking* say to that lady?"It was the guy behind Charles.He had dreads and what looked like alpaca wool covered in Chotchkie's flair.But his physique was decidedly more juicer than deadhead, and he was glaring at me so hard his face seemed to be turning red."I...uh...Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad, Apple Slices, and water....Please."I wasn't lying.I *had* said that.*I* had said that.And what she heard, too, was almost undoubtedly that, just in another language.And I'm sure she understood it as that, unless she's rusty in her mother tongueI guess it's been a while, after all."Oh yeah?It didn't sound like that to me.It sounded more like 'Sow'll whisper pepequem nose googah' something or other.And I meanlook at her!What did she say back?"I briefly looked back at the cashier.There she was, still staring at nothing, still still.At least I could detect what seemed to be a little bit of breathing now."She said, um..." *Do I tell him the truth?It might be bizarre enough to throw him off his game...*

Charlie helped me out."I'm pretty sure I heard her.She said 'Nobody's going to have anguish in the thousand years.'"He smiled, nodded once, and bizarrely, as if this sort of thing happened to him every day, turned back to studying the menu.The Merry Roider seemed to be thrown off his game.He unclenched his face, and it started turning back to that peach tone he clearly wished he didn't have."Is that, uh, is that really what she said?""Um, yup."I nodded a few times, briskly, while staring off to the right.*Convincing performance.*

"Well, what the hell does *that* mean?"Beef Slackinoff sure was nosey for just some guy standing in line at McDonald's."It, uh, it means..."

Chuck chimed in."I'm glad you asked!"He proceeded to begin to explain...something...to Navy Gravy, while I took the opportunity to extract myself from the conversation and bridge the two-foot gap between myself and the counter.Our cashier starting coming to."Where...uhh...where did you learn that?How did you know I spoke it?"*Shit.* I had no alibi.I didn't even know what I was supposed to have an alibi *for.* "Uh, y'know, you pick up a few things here and there..."

"In *Proto-Indo-European?*"

So *that's* what it was!How the hell was it her native tongue, though?"Um, yeah, you know, just hanging out with other kids when I was little and, um, I mean, reading books, not hanging out" I was really good at this."So do you, like, just go up to everyone and do this?Is that, like, your shtick?How often do you get beat up for it?""Well, *actually*"my first good idea of the day just popped into my head"I usually try to make an educated guess first as to what someone speaks.And I do have a pretty good batting average."I nodded knowingly, as though I had just securely built the roof of a house of cards."Quosmd pewgwonts 'mene gnews?"*Fuck.* I just realized that despite all this conversation, sheand apparently everyone else aroundstill heard me speaking in this language I'd never even heard of.She was just starting to respond in it, and I had no fucking clue what she was saying.I stared blankly and blinked for a few seconds."Excuse me?""But how the fuck did you know for me?"I had to think fast, as if a windstorm were about to arrive at card village and I was its only retrofitter."Oh, well, uh, you know..."

I noticed she was wearing a McDonald's tag with her name, Lydia Szemerenyi, on it.I pointed to it."It was that."The bullshit was flowing so freely out of my mouth that I started to fear for the sanitation of this joint.She looked down and nodded knowingly, a tear coming to her right eye."It was great-grandpa's dying wish when I was born.Grandpa, dad, mom, the whole bunch, they didn't let me play with other kids until my sixth birthday, and wouldn't speak to me in anything other than that godforsaken abomination of a tongue"

Chotchkie's interrupted her moment."Can't anyone get a *fucking* burger around here?"
