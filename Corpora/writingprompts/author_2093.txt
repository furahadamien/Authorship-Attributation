"Turn around, did I find you?"I froze.*What the fuck?* 

"Don't be afraid."Strangers bumped past my shoulders, struggling to get past me.Like a rock in a fast-bubbling brook, I remained fixed to the subway floor.I tried to calm my thoughts.She could hear all of them, after all.But curiosity and sheer impulse took over soon enough - she'd invaded my every waking moment.I fought back, but desire forced my neck to turn, slowly.Behind me, I saw a girl, possibly around 27 or so, staring back at me."Is it you?"her voice rang through my head, her lips unmoving.*Yes.*

A grin spread across her face.Suddenly, a flash of panic spread through me.What if she was going to kill me?Destroy the voice in her head?"Don't be ridiculous!I would never do that."I cursed myself in my head, before realising she could hear that too.I felt more exposed than ever.She sighed."Don't be afraid.It's okay.Way I see it, we have a special bond.I think, somehow, fate brought us together."I raised an eyebrow.A man in an orange coat pushed past me angrily."Get outta the way, pal!"I remembered where I was and quickly took a seat on a nearby bench.She did the same, still looking at me triumphantly."You see, I was in New York for a conference, but I heard your thoughts and, well, I know you were headed here for a family reunion too."I nodded."I thought I'd come and find you.It was easy enough - you tend to think while you read, so when you read the subway signs I knew where you were headed."I nodded again, somewhat sheepishly this time.There was a long pause, filled with the fairly loud hustle and bustle of commuters on their way to work, punctuated by the screeching of trains and blaring announcements.We just looked at each other, lost in each other's eyes.For the first time, neither of us was thinking anything.Silence in our heads.Peace."...well, what now?"I said softly."I don't know," she said simply, shifting her gaze to the floor."Look.Just now, we were both silent.For the first time for as long as I can remember, there was peace.And we both know each other pretty well, don't we?"She chuckled."Maybe a bit too well," she mused."Well, I don't know how to say this, but..."

Her eyes lit up and a cheeky grin grew on her face."You've already heard it, haven't you?"I smiled.*Yes.*

We got up and climbed the stairs up to the light.By the time the sun kissed our skin with its warmth, we were holding hands and headed to the nearest cafe.I used to think that she was a curse, but now it's becoming clear.We had something nobody else in the world had; a deep, inexplicable connection that couldn't be explained.I don't know how this is going to work, but this feels right.Just as I was about to vocalise my thoughts, she caught me in a smile.*Ah.I forgot you can hear me.This is weird.*

"We'll get used to it."I squeezed her hand and we walked along the pavement, wet and shining with the sunset's colours, reflected on the stone.
