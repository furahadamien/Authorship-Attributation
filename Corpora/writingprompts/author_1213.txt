*Bullshit,* I think.How can I be loved when everyone thinks I'm just a lazy, stupid piece of shit?Why would I be accepted if nobody even cares to see things from my point of view, to even try to see how much I suffer, how hard it is to try to be like everyone else?I know I shouldn't be thinking like this, it's a horrible line of thought.And yet I do.I am not having a merry Christmas, and neither am I going to have a happy New Year.The future is bleak for me.The future is shit, all it leads to is more suffering while I try to pretend everything's fine.And then I remind myself that it's the holidays.Nobody should be sad during the holidays.And so I force myself to be positive.To have happy, happy thoughts.To try to be happy.And then I start to realize.Nobody understands me, and they sure as hell won't accept that I'm different.But they still love me.No matter how ignorant they are of how shit my life actually is,

No matter how ignorant they are of how hard it is for me to try,

They still love me.I just have to be happy for them.So I put on a smile,

Even if it's just for the holidays.
