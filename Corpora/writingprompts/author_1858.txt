"Im-- we, are gonna escape from this place pretty soon, Phil.You can count on that, 1-dig...cant you see our glorious luck stat?Phil, the guard, looks at you  and gets as close as the door allows him, raising an eyebrow and smiling with crooked teeths.Some days you wondered why some people, like him, only have one digit on their life, but you sure are glad Phil is one of them

 "Ha!"Says Phil with a lisping, yet strangely cozy voice "This place is a fortress...even a nuke wouldnt really damage it unless it strike it directly.And even then, you would be trapped here, with me..."

In that exact moment, the guard face went pale and one of his eyes started twitching, while he tried without much sucess to moist his now dry lips.He stared at the near dozen ofman-made atomic comets flying into the sky.Everoyne could see they would strike someplace near.Soon.You smile trully for the first time in almost a month

 "No, Phil" You say and open your hand, letting a D20 roll off from it."You are trapped here with us"
