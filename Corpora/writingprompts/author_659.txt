26.TWENTY SIX?!Are you.freaking.kidding.me?They won't give the Longetharin device to anyone older than 26.Two years off and that is all.two years.Fuck that.Fuck.That.gimme 

2 years of planning and a lot of negotiating and failed deals later, a 21 year old suicidal college kid named Juan Roderiguez makes a deal with me: I pay for his mom, I get his Longetharin, and nobody tells his mom he committed suicide.Fine by me, I even get most of it in writing.And from there, it's back to doing what I always do: careful health monitoring, careful diet, avoiding accidents, and and and and and.I've got a Longetharin, I'm signed up for Cryonics just in case, attend Longevity conferences.At 51, there's some legal hangups about Juan, and then the entire national system collapses for 4 years in the Althawrat Revolution and then nobody cares.Nobody has new Longetharins implanted after that.Most people don't even have electricity most days.\-I'M\- fine.The planet certainly is not fine.Even before the Althawrat Revolution, I was "into" survival.Longetharin, savings accounts, 72 hour kits, a hole in the ground to hide in.And then my hole in the middle of Western USA got too hot.After the  Althawrat Revolution, I moved up to a hole in the ground in Alaska.I'm 85, in marvelous physical condition, with Juan's Longetharin ticking away like clockwork, but Alaska's on fire and the only edible thing is the guy in the hole next to me.I could have lived forever, but the planet's got a shorter lifespan than I do.Thanks, global warming!
