How did I lose to that creep Gary?As if getting the late shift isn't bad enough, I get it for a week!It's slow today too, so why even be open?Everyone is pretty down since the manager caught the guys trying to watch the game, cutting off their little party.I'm not sure why they care so much, I mean, it's a ball that's thrown back and forth.I'm sitting in the back, bored.No one has come in for at least 30 minutes, maybe longer.So I've just been playing on my phone, seeing if I can find a way to watch my show that I'm missing.Ugh, Gary.I swear he cheated.The door opens, so I close my phone and make my way to the counter, my feet killing me.I wouldn't be working here if the forger would hurry up with my freaking papers, but he's being a douche about it.Figures, I need to find a new one.Maybe Lance will know someone?But, I try to avoid him unless it's an emergency, pissy men who don't get enough action are not an emergency.A cute girl with blonde hair, looking at her phone like she's about to cry slowly makes her way to the counter.Her brown eyes are large and full of sorrow.I try to be understanding, girls are so emotional, but I honestly hope she doesn't just breakdown into a long drawn out story about her blah blah blah issue."Hi, welcome to McDonald's how may I help you?"She opens her mouth, lips quivering, and I brace for the worst.Sniffling, she asks, "Can you give me a-"

I grab her hand, making her squeak, but hearing her ask me a question me in my native language freaks me out.I sit her in a booth, hand over her mouth.Heart pounding, fear I haven't felt in ages bubbles in my chest."Don't-" I correct my language, changing back to English."Don't move."Standing up, I move away from the booth, able to catch her if she runs."Ernie, my kid sister just got beat by a douche in the next town, I'll be back."My manager pops his head around the corner.He can see something is wrong, see that there's something going on, and just nods his head."Sure, but if you're arrested, you're fired."Thank you for being consistently uncaring, it's just saved my life.Grabbing her hand, I pull her outside, throw her in my car and start the engine."Are you going to kill me?"She chokes."Depends."I take her out of town, into the next county, and pull into an old diner.I know the owner, he's a witch, has known about me for years now.He'll be able to tell what she is.If this isn't an emergency, I don't know what is."I don't want to go, I don't know what I-"

"You-" I whisper very quietly, "are speaking an old language, as old as time, a dead language and for good reason, and I need you to stop.The more you prattle off to me, the more dangerous it gets, got it?"She nods her head, and we walk in together.She's shaking, and I don't blame her, but she has no clue what he's gotten into.Lance comes out, burly man with black and pepper hair.He sees the girl, my angry face, then nods.Snapping his fingers, the place goes dark and symbols glow in the walls.She shrieks as she sees his true form, grotesque and old, a man who has beaten death.She, though, remains the same, a human."Why did you bring me a human?""She speaks languages that she shouldn't.""Ah, I see, afraid they'll find you out Gabriel?""Don't use that name," I growl, hand balling into a fist.His smile is dark, but it only lasts a moment."Alright fleshling, what do you speak?""Everything," she says with tears in her eyes,
"I was born with it, I can speak other people's languages.I can't control it, I didn't mean to.I just wanted to eat my sorrows away!"Then she breaks down, tears flowing and all.He looks at me as if to ask for help, I only shrug."My boyfriend cheated on my," she sobs, trying to breath, "I just wanted nuggets and fries... with a shake and a large coke.I don't know what's going on, or what I spoke.I'm sorry!I don't want to die!"The only reason I believe her is Lance is originally a viking, from Skandinavia, and his language is dead too.Although I know his language as well, I have never conversed with Lance in it.Yet this blonde little girl has been speaking it the entire time."I would say she's mixed," he says quietly with a small hand gesture, "maybe half angel?""She would have imploded by now, humans and angels don't mix.Half fairy?""No, she isn't pretty enough.Half jeanie?""Possibly?But that means her luck should be better, right?"As we watch her continue to cry, Lance turns the lights back on.Grabbing a cup, he fills it with coke and hands it to her."We have a lot to discuss with you child.""You're not going to kill me?"She wipes away her tears, taking the coke from Lance."Nope, and if you stay and explain everything to me, I might even give you a shake.""With fries?""That's pushing it kid."She looks down, but takes a swig of her coke."Now tell me, who are you?"

"I don't want it," I said, pushing the book away.Although standing in a white room, pain free and healthy, despite being 93, I knew what this book meant."We give you the option-" 

"I understand," I responded crisply, "but angels don't understand some of the pains humans go through.""Your abusive past-" 

"Will remain that way," I tell him, looking down, "I can't relive it, and I can't see what would of happened had I not gone out that night.Or, had I ended it.If I told my parents no that one time.So no, I won't read it.""Very well," he said, the book disappearing, "follow me please, God is waiting.He knew you were going to turn it down."
