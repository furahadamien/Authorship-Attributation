Deep in the Cascade mountains a man is running for his life.Through thick underbrush, dense evergreen forests, past rivers and waterfalls without a navigation bone in his body.Lost and put into a panic by that thing, that beast!Chasing, hunting and never relenting."It had to have been twelve feet tall" he labors out through ragged breaths "I can't stop for any longer; where the fuck am I?"Thinking on what was most likely just waiting on him to collapse brought the panic back with it.Bright yellow fur with large jagged black lines all over it.A long tail that didn't look like anything else on earth all bent in so many places.And the teeth that it had surely were for tearing flesh off bone.Though the worst thing was it's cry!It almost was familiar and seemed to be made up from one sound just started and stopped from different places.Exhausted and in real need of a long break he hears a cry peel out of the forest."Oh god it sounds closer!"He yells in surprise, clamping a hand over his mouth and wishing he never spoke that out loud he hears a snap all to close."Why do I feel so calm all of a sudden?And so light?"The man's vision clears up and seemingly like waking up from a dream he find himself looking at a large theater screen.On the screen is a horrible shot of a beast devouring some poor helpless sap.Looking around he sees others watching this horror show and wonders why he would go to this kind of movie.With a sigh and considerable amount of concentration and focus he makes out the face of one of the others in the theater."Hello" he whispers "what is your name, I feel like I should know you?"The lady looks over with a confused face that turns into an understanding face like she didn't know he was there then opens her mouth to say something.Right before that can happen the lights fade in and an employee steps in front of the screen."Thank you everyone for your understanding as the next act is prepared for your enjoyment, if you want any snacks or refreshments please use the order tablet attached to the arm rest.We also have a new patron in our midst who will need some adjustment time.Do not worry sir you will understand when the next act comes on or you can access the FAQ section of your order tablet.Fifteen minutes till the next act thank you".The employee excited and the man was left staring with his mouth open like a fish."Hahaha you look so dumb right now" the lady says through fits of laughter."Well you would too if didn't remember going to a terrible movie without anyone you know" he stated indignantly."I must have been blackout drunk!"The lady reaches over and puts a hand on his arm, a caring look on her face she sighs and says "it was exactly the same for me when I first got here, but when you die you must go somewhere right?This might not be heaven but it sure isn't hell either".Wait did he just hear her correctly.Heaven, hell, after you die??Then like a ton of bricks he remembers the chase, the panic and pain of being mauled.The bright yellow fur and the electric shocks that beast used to stun him before he could escape."SO THAT WAS ME!?"Yelling now at the lady "I AM DEAD, REALLY DEAD?THIS CAN'T BE!I WORKED SO HARD" breathing hard now he continues in a more subdued voice "I wasn't able to propose to Karly, or say goodbye to my mother."An embrace this time from more than one set of arms."Not all of us had such a horrible ending, but then again not all of us had such success in personal life.We were always here for you though, cheering you on when you felt depressed and voting with you in those tough decisions in life.You were never alone and you will be there for the next you that comes along" feeling better and now with a sort of understanding coming over him he is able to place the odd feeling of familiarity.All of them are him just in different times and life's, and apparently planets.Just then the lights dim and a white screen shows up with the words "birth" on it.Blinding light and all the other senses being overwhelmed with information, breath, air, a swift and sudden pat on the rear end causing a tiny cry."It's a girl!"A voice says.A collective aww goes over the theater as the next you is introduced to a wonder filled experience called life.Love, pride, fulfillment, despair, hope and all the many choices that come and go.These are the things that we will all witness with the next generation, feel with them and choose with them.So just sit back and enjoy, your time is done and now you get to be the one behind the scenes.
