"Welcome!"They shouted.Hundreds.Of me."What the.."
One of the men came to me and spoke as the others went silent."Oh god number even number 251 was sure you'd make it!"Everyone laughed."Are y'all..me?"The guy noded as I shook my head in disbelief."You're dead pal.Number 701.".My head was a mess.how.. how did I die?"A car accident."another guy replied without me even questioning him."2 who's the leader here?"the first guy asked in anger."You..I kn.."
-"you want to end up like 563?"I looked anxious at the tense scene forming in front of me."what.. happened to 563?"I asked politely.Every single version of me looked at me then at the first guy."Let's start this over."he said."I'm 1.I'm the first you to visit here.When one of us dies we come and watch the next Mike in the theater room right there.Almost always he gets some random twist in his life.You might be confused so ask away anything that comes to your mind."-"How come you all look my age?""we all simply died around the same time.At the age of 35."1 replied almost immediately, giving me the impression he already answered this quite a lot.-"How did you die?".He looked at me."since I'm the first to come here no one was here to watch you see."he replied again."so we don't.."
-"yeah"."So this is a death machine of replicas of Mikes?"1 laughed a bit then said "basically there's a slight variation every time.You're the doubting kind huh?We could see that on the screen.Some got bored though.I'd say you're the first variation to have this."2 spoke again - "The birth screening is about to start!Come on!"As I walked towards the theater I saw 1 staying still outside.We entered the screening room."Whats up with 1?"I asked 2.-"He gets sad watching another one starting its way".I nodded but.. it kinda bothered me.The leader is left outside?..And what happened to 563?The cries of me as a baby distracted my thoughts.I stood up and walked outside."No you can't!"2 shouted.I started running and went through the exit door of the entire building..It was 1.He was on the phone."No he doesn't know.Come on boss it looks just real!You said that the 700th person would do!We had a deal!"I gasped in shock.No... No..
1 turns around finally and notices me.slowly.. he pulls out a gun."Wanna know what happened to 563?"He pulls the trigger and I close my eyes.Im already dead- am I not?"Welcome!"They shouted.Hundreds.Of me.---------------------------
