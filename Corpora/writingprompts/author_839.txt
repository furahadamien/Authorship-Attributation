# OH, GOD, THE SPIDERS, OH SHIT, HELP THEY'RE IN MY EYES!OH JESUS, HELP ME!GOD, WHY?![So...yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqgW-2orQQg)

I bet you're wondering how I got here.Nobody with any shred of sanity wakes up in the morning expecting to watch their landlord get dragged away by a mass of angry spiders that very afternoon, but here we are.It all started in 2002, when I was in middle school.I was a pretty normal kid, but I had kind of a phobia of spiders.I knew most of them were pretty harmless where I lived, but I saw a movie where a guy got bit by a spider, and started melting into a dude smoothie, and it scarred me, man.So when I saw a spider in the corner of my room, I reacted as any rational person would.I screamed like Fay Wray and sprinted down the stairs to get my dad to kill it.He grudgingly followed my up to my rom while I babbled like an idiot, and I pointed at the spider.He looked at me, groaned and pointed to my bed.I sat."Okay, kid, you gotta deal with this whole 'spider' thing you've got.I get it, we shouldn't have let you watch that movie.But this spider's so tiny, it probably wouldn't even break the skin if it bit you.""Are you sure?""Look at the thing.It's so tiny.It couldn't do a thing to you, and you want me to kill it?""But, dad, it-"

"Butts are for poopin', kid.There's no point in hurting something that won't hurt you, and that hurt'll come back to you anyway.My grampa always said, 'today you, tomorrow me.'"Dad blinked."Of course, he said that to justify not beating up the black guy next door.Complicated guy, ol' Pap-Pap.Racist as all get-out, but a firm pacifist."I didn't really have a response to that.Sometimes I think my dad made stuff up to confuse me into not questioning it, but I couldn't deny he had a point.So now I had a roommate.For the better part of the year, I pretty much let it have its corner of the room to itself and pretended it wasn't there, but after a while, I got used to it.Once or twice I'd have a friend over, and they'd try to kill it, but I always stopped them, mostly so my dad wouldn't ground me.That spider stayed there in its little corner, all the way through 8th grade, and then through freshman year.I thought that was a little weird, but I don't know much about spiders, so I just assumed it was the kind of spider that just lived really long.By year 3, it was getting to the point where I considered it a pet.I had named it "Silky" by this point, and decided to give it a proper little vivarium to live in, and fed it with some crickets I'd buy from the pet store.Silky seemed to love its new home, just filled that thing up with this really cool, elaborate web.Eventually, I went off to college, and brought Silky with me.By this point, he was at least half a decade old, so I decided that I'd bring him to one of the teachers at the biology department, who referred me to an entomology professor.He had nothing.He'd never seen it, or anything like it.It was a totally new species.I let him study it for a little while, brought it home, and didn't think about it.I got an apartment just off-campus, and the landlord seemed kinda stiff, but alright.I had a steady job, and the rent wasn't too bad, so I thought I'd be fine.But then, one fateful day, I was a little late on my rent.I tried to call my landlord and explain that I was a little short, and that I'd be able to pay him back next week when I got my paycheck.So he knocked on my door, later that very day, with a huge vein popping on his forehead, and his skin a burning red.I cautiously opened the door, and he slammed it the rest of the way open, and started just, *screaming* at me.Calling me a lazy, entitled, millennial piece of shit with no respect for the rules of society.Just, going and going for about fifteen straight minutes, full of the worst stereotypes about old people's opinions of young people, with five minutes where he got diverted into something about Obama and Kenya, which he managed to somehow pull back around into how shitty I was for being young and not having money.It was kind of amazing, honestly.The guy was like, 70, and he just kep going, barely stopping to take a breath, keeping up full volume from start to finish in this hypnotic sort of rhythm.In fact, he only stopped when my jaw dropped and I pointed at the enormous spider that was slowly lowering itself onto my arm.And then another.I don't know where they came from, but there was a swarm of spiders, bringing our little story full-circle.I'll spare you the screaming a second time, but suffice to say, the landlord was much more understanding of my one-time lateness once he got out of the hospital.He had some bad bites, but nothing really serious.That evening, I just had to sit down, because holy shit, wouldn't you?While I was sitting and trying not to think about what happened, I looked at the vivarium, and noticed Silky was missing.And then I looked around, and noticed that it was sitting on my keyboard, staring intently at me.It just looked at me, like it was saying "You protected me, you fed me for all these years.I will do the same for you."I nodded appreciatively, and the spider nodded back.
