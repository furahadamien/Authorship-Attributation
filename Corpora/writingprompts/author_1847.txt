Vile-Affliction
They say we have all the luck in the world.People sit in their beds before they drift off to sleep and dream about a life where their Grace was  higher.They hope that magically their number will change when they wake the next morning.They pray that the little tattoo on their wrist will jump from a 20 to 40.40 to 60.60 to 80.But thats all it is.Silly prayers that amount 

What they dont know is that I wish I could have my Grace plummet.I envy anything below 60 because they live a life of freedom.They live with some sense of normalcy.But if youre born with that 100 tattooed........ you are truly the unlucky.Thats where I am.Those who are unfortunate enough to be born with all the luck in the world...theyre sentenced to a lifetime of imprisonment.Why, you ask?Well we can easily blame our predecessors that carried the same affliction.They abused their Grace and there were no checks and balances.Kingdoms, empires, countries, they would rise and fall in decades.But now..governments have an iron fist on the Grace system.Even worse, you dont have to be the top millionth of a percentage in the human race to be in the same prison.This maximum security prison houses 32 others just like myself.It doesnt exactly patrol itself.You have to have a 88 Grace number just to be a janitor here.Staff is minimum 92 Grace.The guards here probably carry at least 97s.Its funny.You look at their face and see a mix of emotions.Contempt.Jealousy.Anger.Fear.Its almost as if we arent human to them.I cant help the way I was born.I get it.We can commit terrible crimes to humanity.But we can also do so well...I think the people around me forget that they are mere degrees of being on this side of the fence.Oh well.Luckily for me, I plan on getting it of here soon.Because just my luck, I saw something I wasnt supposed to.One of the guards was new, and they were moving one of the roommates.Of course, as anyone would, he made an attempt to flee.As they scuffled, the new guards sleeves slipped.And I saw his Grace number.A 79!79 Grace?!That man shouldnt even be mopping the floors, yet here he was holding us back.And he saw that I noticed too.The thing that gives me so much courage?The fear in his eyes as the realization set in.He knew what I knew.With my luck, all these guards are under qualified.Which means I have a shot at escaping.
