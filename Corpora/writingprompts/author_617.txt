After the alarm went off I started to groggily mumble something to my wife when I was hit with a rush of adrenaline that caused my eyes to snap open.Something happened to my memory.I don't know what yet, but I'll find out; ever since I was a teenager I've had a signal I use if I think there's a chance someone's going to mess with my mind, if I don't remember making the signal or why I made it then I check a hidden storage server I made.It's a Rasberry Pi buried under the crawlspace of my parents' old house that's powered by a small solar cell.I decided to wait until my wife went to work to drive out there.She's the only other person who knew about the signal or server, so I didn't think she was part of whatever was happening, but no sense in alarming her until I knew something.I thought I'd peruse the news to pass the time until she left.Unfortunately, after a few minutes of browsing that adrenaline rush was back when I stumbled on an article about the Scrubber, a superhero capable of replacing years of memories as a way of rehabilitating villains.I hadn't considered him and I knew I hadn't done anything wrong, but couldn't help but dread the possibility that someone else developed the same ability and used it against me or my family for some reason.I definitely remember being good with money and making a lot of really good choices with my retirement funds, but maybe not.I couldn't avoid my wife's suspicion, I'd explode if I didn't find out, I went upstairs and told her "markovian parallax denigrate."It was a gibberish spam message from the internet, but we'd agreed years ago to use it as a signal that something was wrong but couldn't be talked about yet.I'm fairly confident that whoever did this only took a few years from me, the groundwork for my memory wipe insurance policy was laid out in grade school, if there was a change during the my mid to late teens the earlier memories wouldn't make sense.I drove to the bank I hadn't set foot in since I was 17 and asked to see my safety deposit box.I pocketed a small black scanner and the thousand dollars in the box, and went on my way.I drove approximately 6 hours east to Green Bank West Virginia, a very special city where all wireless transmission is banned to aid the large radio telescope there, I could scan my car for bugs and be certain there wasn't any outside interference.The drive was uneventful, but exhausting.That increasingly familiar pump of adrenaline perked me back up after I turned on the RF scanner and discovered my car was transmitting a signal.It took nearly 30 minutes to pinpoint where they'd hidden it, it was powered by the wire that lit the LED in the automatic window button.After removing it, I drove the 6 hours back west to go to my childhood home without being followed.It was nearly dark when I got back, so I passed the time by buying the cheapest factory sealed laptop I could find.After the homeowners seemed to fall asleep I snuck into the crawlspace(protip: always padlock your crawlspace otherwise any jackass can get in) and retrieved the Pi from its hiding spot.It was still working, apparently the neighbors never bothered to change their wifi passwords.Putting the SD card into the laptop and viewing the video files from the archive cut straight through me; before we had been rewritten into a stay at home dad and bookstore owner my wife and I were both journalists, and we had been working on an expose about the legality of the Scrubber essentially killing who someone was and replacing them with a brainwashed doppleganger when nobody even knew how many people he was doing that to.I couldn't help but chuckle to myself for not realizing that being a stay at home dad makes no sense given that we never had children.I made 5 copies of the SD card and mailed it to 5 of our former journalist friends in the hope that maybe we could get the truth out.Maybe someone would eventually put a bullet in through that bastards head before he did that to my friends.I went home only to find my wife lying unconscious on the floor with the Scrubber standing over her."I hope whatever you did today after turning off the tracker was worth it" he said to me.I started to respond, before I said anything that version of me was gone.
