Talia sighs, smoothing her hair behind her ear.She is sitting on the floor of a library, trying to find something, anything, of interest for her project.It was for a type of english class, and she needed a newspaper story to write about.They could get extra credit if they used real, old newspapers, and not online.Talia isnt sure why.One newspaper catches her eye.It is mostly under another newspaper, but she brushes it off.Slowly, she picks it up and holds it closer to her face.The headline- it cant be.TALIA LIANTRA- THE WORLDS MOST POWERFUL SUPERVILLAIN
and under that, it proceeds to tell of how she destroyed three major cities, completely and utterly leveling them, and then how shed burned the surrounding areas and other countrysides.And then, lower on the page.STOPPED BY THE OBLIVION.and then nothing after that.No.No, no... Talia cant believe it.Of course she doesnt remember, no one would.The Oblivion- a superhero that stopped villains like her by erasing their memory, and everyone who ever knew of them being a villain.Except.One couldnt erase ink.Quickly Talia stuffs the newspaper in her handbag.She isnt supposed to take the newspapers out of the library but shed be toast if anyone saw this.What if there are more like this?What if there are newspapers of other villains?The most powerful supervillain.So... shed had powers.The Oblivion couldnt take anything but memories.So she still has them.If only she could remember what they are.Talia searches through the remaining newspapers, mostly looking for others about her or other villains, and, finding none, takes one that was adequate for her write-up in english class.She makes it through the library, the newspaper undetected in her bag.She tries not to cringe as she goes out the door.And then she wonders, why would I feel bad about taking something that shouldnt be there anyway?Why would I feel anything at all when I used to be a super villain?If thats who I was, is it really as simple as erasing memories to change someones identity, values, morals?The Oblivion, after erasing everyones memories, integrated the villain safely back into society.Which explains how she had no idea how she got into the college she did, or that apartment.She doesnt have many friends, and had always felt she had less memories than she should.Powers, though.If she could get those back... Talia isnt sure.She doesnt feel like a villain.The Oblivion is pretty much all that is needed to fight villains.So... then what?Have fun, Talia supposes.
