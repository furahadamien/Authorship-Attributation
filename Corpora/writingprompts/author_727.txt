Part 1

"If you're watching this then I'm probably dead.I'm leaving this video because I don't know if I'll come back.The end is coming.The dagger I have on my person is enchanted and will take who ever is killed by its blade to another liveable earth in a different dimension.At least that's what I was told.I have no idea what's going to happen but if I don't make it back then I leave this weapon to anyone who's willing to test it further."Sam grabbed the dagger in one hand and stepped out of his vehicle.He placed his phone in his pocket and walked up to the hospital doors.Sam was in tears and looked like he hadn't slept in days.It was late and the emergency room wasn't very busy.The street was silent except for the distant sound of a train passing on the outskirts of the city.Sam dragged the blade across his arm along his most visible vein spewing blood on the cement walkway leading up to the hospital doors.He tried to do the same to other wrist but he couldn't grip the hilt with his blood soaked hand.He put the blade between his pants and belt and laid on the sidewalk waiting.Sam felt coldness sweep over him and felt a strange anxiousness followed by peace, a deep silence and then darkness.The next thing Sam felt was dry heat and sand.When Sam's eyes adjusted to the light he saw desert in every direction.He was naked and hairless which Sam assumed was just part of the daggers magic.Not knowing if his plan would work Sam decided to get up and try to find shelter, clothing and water.Sam had to survive in this alien world if hoped to be brought back alive in his world.
