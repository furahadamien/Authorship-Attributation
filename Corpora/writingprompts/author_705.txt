What would you do if you were going to die in two years?What would *anyone* do?When NASA first released the statement describing the asteroid heading straight for Earth, nobody cared.Well, *some* people cared, the crazy doomsday prophets and homeless people mostly, claiming it's the end of times, God's here to punish us for our sins and so on.But the general population carried on, grabbing selfies with pumpkin spice lattes and retweeting celebrities.When the two nuclear warheads designed to break up the asteroid detonated and failed, people started paying attention.Uneasy jokes about human extinction dominated talk shows, quickly replaced by parodies of political leaders and their sex scandals.An uncomfortable feeling seemed to have seeped into the collective human consciousness, as we begin to doubt our ability to stop the end of the world.When serious scientists predicted Earth had only two years left, we lost it.Everybody seemed to be seized by a need to *do* something.Money became irrelevant.You can't take that with you, after all.Some decided to dedicate their remaining time and fortune into helping take down the asteroid.Others poured their money and life into religion, praying almost continuously for some divine intervention.Most opted for a more... hedonistic approach to the apocalypse.Me?Well, I have a more disciplined technique.I set about fulfilling my life's purpose.I found it when I was trekking in the woods, when I was eighteen.A knife, gold and silver, with intricate designs sculpted into its handle, with a small ruby at the hilt.Greek words were carved along the length of the blade, which Google Translate told me meant "Life is Death."It stood in the corner of my bedroom, just a cool souvenir from my trip to Yellowstone, for what seemed to be years.But the day we learned Earth was dead, it started whispering.Soft, at first, almost imperceptible."David," it had said."Help me."I was sure I was going crazy.Knives don't talk, and a asteroid gunning straight for Earth doesn't change that.I threw it out by the second night.Or at least, I think I did.I don't remember anymore.What I do remember is the knife, sitting stubbornly on the table when I came home from lunch."David.Please."It went on for days.He kept muttering my name, calling me.He seemed to grow stronger in darkness, his sweet voice growing louder in the night.I couldn't sleep.How could I, when he was sat at the corner of my bedroom calling me?"Please, stop it," I begged."I just want some fucking sleep.""We can help stop it," the knife said."We can help *save* the human race.""I'm going c-crazy," I remember crying."I don't want to..."

"You're not going crazy," he had said."Help me.*Feed* me.*"*

I relented.The first person I sent into the knife was Carol.She was a nurse, a sweet, kind-hearted girl who didn't deserve to have to face the end of the world.He promised that if I had killed her, he would steal her soul and protect her."A beautiful new world," he had said."A world free of ash and destruction."I moved so quickly she couldn't even yell in surprise.I plunged the knife deep into her throat.Blood started pouring down her white blouse, and she collapsed into my arms."David - " she gargled, struggling to speak.Fear seemed to have seized her, I could tell from her eyes.Her face grew paler as life seemed to leave her."It's for your own good," I explained, trying not to cry."I'm sorry."That was three months ago.I've been hard at work, saving people from the asteroid.I wasn't selective.I didn't discriminate and only saved people who I knew.No, no.Jesus prayed for everyone, even his enemies.The knife was willing to save everybody - short or tall, fat or thin, beautiful or ugly.It didn't matter.But if you have helped as many people as I had, it's natural for you to face opposition.People who didn't *believe*, and thought that I was murdering for fun.Don't they see?We are doomed.We are a dead planet living on borrowed time, and I am our only savior.Perhaps they wanted the sweet gift of death as well, and they were just jealous that they hadn't yet been spared from the asteroid.It doesn't matter.He was the only thing that mattered.The feeling of warm, wet, sticky blood flowing over my hand as the knife pardoned another.The feeling of watching life fade from their eyes, as they turn from human to corpse."Our journey is at an end," he said.I could hear their boots, barreling up the stairs.Their rifles clicking, ready to kill the villain.I chuckled slightly.Aren't they just like me?Killing for protection?Can't they see the irony?Perhaps that is why this world is doomed to fire, I thought.Penance, for crucifying our heroes."I'm sorry," I muttered.I knelt down in my living room, facing the front door."I'm sorry I couldn't save more.""David," he whispered."Thank you for your service."I drove the knife straight into my heart, ready to escape this wretched world.A tightness seemed to crush my chest, as I struggled to breathe.Pain started to spread, like a fire on my nerves.I collapsed on to the floor.The door gave way when they swung the battering ram.I saw the first SWAT soldier, clad in full tactical gear burst in through the door.He spread out, allowing more of his brethren to file in."Tango is down," one of them spoke into the radio."I repeat, Tango is down."I closed my eyes, eager to see [the valley beyond.](https://reddit.com/r/soIwroteathing/)

I remember a blizzard.Hunger.Blinding white snow, and the cold.The bone-chilling cold that threatens frostbite, that makes your hands and face feel numb and yet pain.I was a scientist, I think.We were here to study the Arctic.What exactly I can't remember, but I remember running out of food.Losing communications.Donovan going crazy and attacking us, demanding that we "let him out of here."I remember running away from him, desperate to stay alive and collapsing in the blizzard.I remember praying in the merciless winds, begging to stay alive.That was months ago.Or has it been years?It's hard to tell.Time doesn't work the same around here.Some days fly by in hours while others drag on for weeks.I was rescued, I think.By the elves.Tiny little people with pointy ears.It's all very hard to remember, almost like it was a lifetime ago.The one thing I'm sure of is my mission.I get up every morning, drink a cup of coffee, eat a Turkey, hop in my sleigh, kick the reindeers into gear and fly off into the cold night.I deliver presents, you see.To kids around the world.Anybody below the age of 18.Some of them would be asleep, but many would stay up just for me.They would smile so brightly at the sight of me, and even brighter when I show them their presents.The braver ones would even tackle me into a hug.Seeing them like that made me feel warm.But today?Today was different.My coffee was brown, and gave me a rush I never quite felt before.I hadn't even noticed how muddled my head was before.The coffee seemed to have cleared up a fog that I didn't even notice was there in the first place.Everything became less blurry.One of the smaller elves burst into the room, shutting the door quickly behind him.He glanced around the room furtively, as if to see if there was anyone else around.When he was satisfied he looked at me, realising that I was staring at him.He scampered up to the long table where I was at, snapping his fingers at me."Hello *Santa*," he started, before correcting himself."I mean, Nicholas, do you know where yo u are right now?""The North Pole," I answered.A curious pang of hunger gripped my stomach, and I was filled with an insatiable urge to eat the turkey."We need to get you out of here," he said."This is immoral."I raised the fork and knife, cutting into the delicious turkey.It never smelt so good before."NO!"He yelled, kicking aside the entire turkey.It flew across the table and fell with a dull thud."The food's enchanted," he explained."You'll be under their spell again if you eat that."Anger flooded my system."I'm hungry," I snarled."You'll have to bear with it," he said."The magic is extremely strong."I stood up before I willed my body to, and walked to the turkey.Ripping its leg out with my hands, I brought it to my mouth."Stop!"He protested."You can't eat that!"He was more agile than I expected.With two leaps he kicked the drumstick out of my hands and stuffed a dirty cloth into my mouth."It's for your own good!"I gagged at the sudden entrance of the cloth in my airway, collapsing backwards in shock.He snapped his fingers, and a large wooden bat materialized in his hands."I'm truly sorry about this," he said.The last thing I  was the bat colliding with my skull.
