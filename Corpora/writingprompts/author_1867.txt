"You know why you're here,don't you,son?"I shrugged indifferently at the warden.I would be out soon and we both knew it."A perfect one hundred..." He let out an appreciative whistle "You're a lucky man, son."The warden laughed.We continued to walk down the dim corridor to my cell, a faint hint of jazz straining at the edges of my hearing whenever that fat prick paused his grunting."Look, son.I get it, I really do.This is unfair, but here's the thing...Life ain't fair and you just gotta take a turn at the other end of the unfairness from time to time.We ain't doing this to be mean, hell, we wouldn't be doing this at all if it weren't for Mao.The man caught a break and look what happened...Some people should not be at the top, son.No matter how easy the climb is for them."I glared at him, maybe I should tell him I'll come for him when I'm out.Really rattle his chains.I stay silent instead, why waste my breath?We stop at a door, the jazz more audible from the other side.He pats me on the shoulder and pulled a stack of something plastic from his pocket."I know how much your sister means to you, son.We can wake her up or we can pull the plug.Choice is yours."He hands me the poker chips and ushers me gently through the door."You win that there pot and you're free to go and so is your sister,son.Good luck."He snickers as he slams the door.In front of me is a chair and 7 of the unluckiest bastards to have ever been born lucky.I take my seat.
