Bzzz.Sir, Ive got the union rep from CUNTs outside.He.. *Its not CUNTs!Its Capes-Under-Normal-Tops!...w*ants to talk to you about the latest crimes youve committed.I groaned internally.Another union rep.This is the last thing I wanted to deal with on a Friday.I was just clock-watching until 5 when I could go home, watch the game and chill.And now this clown had to ruin my Friday evening after a busy week.I really wish the neutrality pact didnt force me to suffer their continued meddling.Send him in Sharon.Then you can clock off.Ill lock up tonight.Thanks boss

The door opened, in came Smith, the middle-aged union man in his middle tier suit trying his best not to sweat all over his shirt collar.I think the rolls over his belly contributed more to the sweat than fear of me.&#x200B;

Ah, Mr Jones.Busy week youve been having.You made the front page 3 times in 4 days.The Chronicle has even started a regular gossip column on you.

&#x200B;

What is it Smith?Youve not come down here on a Friday to give media relations training.Spit it out, I have plans tonight.&#x200B;

Not anything like you were up to on Tuesday I hope old boy.That was pretty messy.Look, Ill get to the point.Were supposed to be a neutral party representing Heroes and Villains alike.Our role is to protect you from overbearing governments, and, provide a safe platform for feedback from minions and sidekicks to their higher-ups without fear of, quite literally, being fired.We got the Government to agree to the neutrality pact with CUNTs as mediators 20 years ago on the basis that Heroes and Villains would keep each other roughly in balance.Quite frankly old boy, youre making a mess of that.You arent fitting the stereotype.Youre supposed to tie up the hero, monologue, reveal your plan and give them chance to escape.They undo your plan but dont kill you, thus maintaining the higher moral ground, and in turn give you chance to retreat and devise another scheme.At the end of the day, neutrality is maintained.Understand?You offing them as soon as you get chance is upsetting this finely tuned balance that has taken a few years to develop.

&#x200B;

Look Smith, its not my fault they went to the Mickey-Mouse school of Do-gooders.Christ, Sparkly Bangers was quite literally that!Did she really expect that glittery corset to protect her from a headshot!Its not my fault youve got a bunch of incompetent Heroes running around.I fully intend to take advantage of that until one of them actually gives me a challenge.Most of the Villains youve got here are nothing more than school bullies trying to steal lunch money.Keynote tried to drop a Piano on me last week, I saw that a mile off as he pushed it off the building.Quite frankly its ridiculous.All your heroes are soft and the rest of the villains are little better.What happened to the good old days when Villains were Villains and a grand scheme wasnt something Wiley Coyote could have dreamt up! "&#x200B;

Mr Jones, I understand, I really do.But could you tone it down a little.Im sure in time a Hero equal to you will come along, but until then youre making several Governments twitchy.You're a decent villain, keep your head down, play by the rules for a few years and you could make it to the top.I'm sure a Super-Villain somewhere will notice you and recruit you into their organisation.Rush things, upset the applecart so to speak and well, it could upset this careful system some of us have spent so long cultivating

&#x200B;

No Smith.I wont.I didn't stay late at Evil Elementary practising my evil laugh.I studied all the old fights, read countless news articles, watched fight footage again and again.I worked my ass off to become top of my class.To be honest with you it was easy and now I'm here there's no competition.It's like that school was deliberately useless.Im going to become the greatest Villain of my generation while its easy pickings.

BANG

Mr Jones sat slumped in his chair, the look on his face didnt even show the surprise that had briefly crossed his mind when Smith had drawn the gun.Pity said Smith, holstering the pistol.
