To a seven year old, divorce is hard.I didn't know why my Dad had to move out.I didn't know why my Mom didn't love him anymore, but whatever it was, she did a lot of yelling about it.One weekend my Mom took me to my Aunt Caroline's house and when we got back, his stuff was gone.The next night, he came back and we had a "Family Meeting."They told me about how he wasn't going to live with us anymore.They told me it wasn't my fault.I knew whose fault it was and they didn't have to tell me, but even at seven, you know better than to point fingers.At least I'd still get to see my Dad, every month.Right there, he gave me a package of Oreos and said, "Better stock up on some milk, buddy, because we're going to have Oreos every month!"By the fifth grade, I could remember sitting in the lawyer's waiting room while my Mom went in to "talk to him about how my Dad was treating me."I wasn't sure what that meant, back then.He would show up every month with Oreos just like he promised and we'd talk or throw a frisbee around the yard.She said that's no substitute for "financial responsibility" but I didn't know what that meant.I just knew that she ran him off and she was the one dragging me to this stupid lawyer all the time.My Dad was the same guy I always knew.I loved him for it.By the time I was a senior in high school, Mom's friend Walter moved into our house.Walter was a real man's man kind of guy.He was into guns and hunting and football and every other piece of shit I didn't care about.He called me "Sport" a lot, and I told her it was because he couldn't remember my name.She said I was being too hard on him.I wanted to say, "Like you were with Dad?"but I didn't have the guts.Dad still showed up, though.He was still driving the same car, but it was making a lot of weird noises.At least it made it easy to hear when he was coming up the street.He hadn't always shaved for a day or two, either, but Dad had the Oreos, as promised, every month.Mom would tell me to take them inside while they "talked."That was code for Mom yelling about how the child support check bounced.Again.For the third month in a row.By graduation, Dad didn't bring the car around anymore.He'd just show up on the doorstep.I knew he was walking from the bus stop, because he'd show up sweaty and a little winded.Some of the Oreos were broken and they didn't always taste that fresh.I pretended not to notice the "clearance" sticker.Walter was still a tool, but at least he'd learned to leave me the hell alone and Mom and I tried not to be in the same room as one another.In the fall, I tried a local community college.My grades weren't great and I was worried that my Dad couldn't afford to come see me if I didn't live at my Mom's house.I need not have worried.By October I knew college wasn't for me, mostly because I'd flunked out.My Dad still showed up, though, Oreos in hand and a smile on his face.This time, Mom met him at the door.She told him I was 18 now.She told him, at the top of her lungs, that she didn't have to put up with seeing his sorry, loser face on her property ever again.She told him he could shove those Oreos up his ass for all the good they've ever done anybody.I think she grabbed the Oreo package out of his hand.I think she threw it across the yard.I'm not sure.I was upstairs because I knew where Walter keeps his shotgun.She spent more than 10 years trying to ruin my Dad and all my Dad ever did was bring me Oreos and tell me he loved me.Once a month.Every month.I stopped her and now she won't hurt my Dad anymore.Dad still brings me Oreos every month and I still love him for it.He's gotten a lot older, now, and we can't talk for long when he comes by.It's always sad.He cries before he leaves, now, and that makes me sad, too.The doctors say it's good for me to maintain relationships with family members, and, besides...I still like Oreos.[I know this one is a little off-prompt, but one person's collapse of civilization might not be the same as another's.]
