Clippity clap, clippity clap.The sound of hooves clanked through Hermonie's head.She mulled over her butterbeer, watching the floating instruments playing a rowdy ballad overhead.The Great Hall of Hogwarts was full of drunken laughter but she could not shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong.Harry should never have accepted this invitation, should never trusted Voldemort's offer of peace, nor returned to the school they loved that was currently under his control."Relax Hermione," Harry had said on the ride over, when they paused to rest along the stone tombs of Bath before their arrival that same morning."The peace is done.Voldemort agreed to not intend, and instead sent Professor Snape to handle the peace agreement.Once it's signed all of our friends held hostage there will be safe, and the war will have a respite.No more people need to die."Yet Hermione knew Harry was simply being foolish.Even under the protections of guest right she did not trust Voldemort's intentions, nor the lavish party he was throwing in celebration of the peace accord.She knew the type of man he was dealing with, by the countless house elves he had manning the party, running out trays of endless sweet cakes and juicy bits of exploding caviar."This is some party, aye Hermione?"Ron said, mouth stuffed full of food as he plucked the fleshy wing of a duck off one tray.Grease dripped down his chin and his smile was broad.Ron had been given a place of honor for the treaty at the head of the table, and she knew it favored his need for social approval."These elves are suffering under horrendous slavery, and they'll continue to under the terms of this peace accord," Hermione pointed out, but Ron just turned to grab a handful of jelly beans from the goblet of a green clad elf.She could not understand why she loved him at all.Suddenly she heard a ruckus from the head of the table.The Slytherins began to cheer Harry wildly as he downed yet another pint of bitterbeer.Seated next to him Snape watched glumly.When the Slytherins picked up the drunken boy with the lightning scar and began to toss him in the air Hermione finally gave up.She left the table and walked over the Great Hall window, wistfully looking out in the cold night and wishing yet again that Dumbledore was still there to advise them.It was she who had released the Wizard Slayer that night from tutoring her in potions when he killed their former leader, and the guilt from that had allowed her to relent on the peace accord.Even so she could not trust Snape's claim he was a double agent working against the Dark Lord.No one was that good at the Game of Legilimency... though her own skills had allowed her to hide the knowledge of Harry's twin brother, secreted away the same night Harry was and left with a distant relation in the cold north of Scotland.If anything should happen that night John Snow would be their last hope.Above, the music changed.Hermione turned, a chill running up her spine.She knew this song.It was *The Face of Voldemort* by the bard John Williams.Behind her Snape stood and began to march out of the hall.Hermione walked over and slapped him.Snape looked down on her, a lumbering sneer across his lips.She moved to grab her wand, but he simply uttered "Expelliarmus," and her wand flew out of her hand.Across the Great Hall was bloody chaos as the music reached its climax.The clippty clop sound of a dozen centaurs burst into the hall.Two of them slashed and tore Dean Thomas right in half before he could even lift a hand.Neville attempted to dual another, but was hit in the back by a killing curse but two young witches.Luna turned to flee but suddenly was knocked into the wall by one spell, while it took three Slytherins to take down a mad Hagrid, who smashed two with a table before the third lopped of the giants head.At the head of the table Hermione turned to see a Ron, frozen with a stupid grin on his face and mouth stuffed with griffin eggs by a Immobulus charm, be scurried away.Hermione knew she had to act fast.She dove for her wand and reached it, then shot one curse after another at the Slytherins in a rush to reach Harry."Girl, stop," a voice commanded.She turned to see the dead eyes hollowed deep in the snake like face of Voldemort behind her.He had a drunk Harry in a headlock and the Dark Lord's wand pointed at his messy black hair matted to his face."Don't harm him or Ron!"Hermione screamed, grabbing Lucius Malfoy whom she had knocked over, thinking of anything she could offer to negotiate."What you did here was a dark deed, even by the black arts you dabble in.You violated guest right, and peace accord you just signed by a blood oath.That is powerful magic, and it will be turned against you!Let the three of us go, and I vow we will leave England and never return to trouble you.I swear it by the Godric Gryffindor.Do it or I'll kill your young heir."Voldemort shrugged."I'll find another."Right then a fat man entered the hall, with an odd fishermans cap and a great white beard covering the jowls of his chin.He reached into his suspenders as he marched across the Great Hall to the vulnerable Harry, then stabbed him right in the heart with his pen.**"The 2001 Hugo Awards send their regards,"** he said.Hermione screamed and flicked her wrist to send a killing curse right into Malfoy's head.The clippity clop, clippity clop sound returned and she kept screaming, right as a curse hit her, erasing everything she had ever learned, from the day she was born to the woman she was today.*Not my mind* she thought, a terrible final realization, *everyone loves my mind.*
