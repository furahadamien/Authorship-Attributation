When I first heard about "The Great Blinding" I thought it was a joke, people had made fun of me for my handicap my whole life, so I was perhaps a bit more distrustful than I should've been.It took me several days before I actually joined in the effort to help acclimatize the rest of the world to being blind, and the better part of a month before I actually started to come to grips with the fact that this was real, everyone was blind, and now instead of being looked down upon or pitied by much of the world I was seen as an elder of the community.Eventually things returned more or less to normal, albeit now I was seen as an equal instead of disabled, and there was the social prestige of having helped the community with the transition.Nobody ever figured out why it had happened, just that it had happened.And then, midway through the day roughly two years after The Great Blinding I saw for the first time.But it wasn't quite like how it had been described to me.I could see in every direction for one, and my vision didn't seem to be blocked by walls either, though details were fuzzy if my view was obstructed.As I sat stunned and gazed out at the universe my blood ran cold.We were alone in the universe.The only life in existence was on this planet.But there was evidence of life elsewhere in the universe, structures, cities, some ruined, some fresh.I thought for a moment I saw something moving on another planet, but then I realized it was a faucet of some sort.Still running.None of that got to me though.On every artificial surface, every wall, every floor, every roof, every ceiling, on every world there was the same message in plain English."DON'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE" 

I was snapped out of my cold sweat when I heard a knock at the door, it was my neighbor Blake, returning the book I'd lent him a week ago, accompanied by his service dog.I started for the door before freezing, my breath catching in my throat, I silently crept back to where I'd been sitting, and grabbed my cane, and went back toward the door, keeping up the act of blindness.
