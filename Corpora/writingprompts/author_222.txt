The Great Blinding is proclaimed as the worst event to happen in human history.For me, that was certainly the case.My mother was on a flight back home from her monthly work trip in DC.My father was on I-64, taking my grandparents to visit my sister and the twins she had a month prior.In an instant they were gone.Two generations of my family, gone.Over the course of a couple years, I managed to move in with my sister.Helping care for my neices during my mourning was the only thing that kept me sane.I told my sister I was going to make a trip to the old house this morning.I said my goodbyes and headed out.I had made the trek enough times to know exactly how many steps it would take along the abandoned interstate, every one bringing back memories of my family, good and bad.I was about halfway there when I tripped.I attempted to catch myself, but instead landed face first in a... puddle?No it was too thick for that.I sat up, wiping the slimey substance from my face.Slowly and painfully, light started to peek through.I was starting to see again.I heard movement down the road.My head snapped towards the noise.It couldn't be, it's not possible... My vision was blurry, but without doubt I knew the first thing I was seeing with my renewed vision.Crumpled into the median, slowly rusting away, was my dad's car.What cruel irony is this?I can finally see again, and of all things, that's what I see first?Not a moment later, I saw what caused the noise.I couldn't believe what I was seeing, hell I couldn't believe I *was* seeing.After a moment my vision cleared.I couldn't contain my excitement.I shouted, "Dad?Dad!", waving my arms frantically.The figure of my father looked at me, then fell to the ground.A horrible shrieking erupted from everywhere.I tried to locate the source.Pools of the slime were scattered about, their nearly fluorescent white drew my attention away from the countless car wrecks.The figure stood up.A tall, slender, brown, creature stood in my father's place.His eyeless face stared at me.The saliva dripping from his mouth was the same white as the puddles.More shrieking echoed down the interstate.2 more of these monsters came from the wreckage of my father's car.Hundreds more appeared from seemingly nowhere, surrounding me.On the wall behind my father and grandparents I could see a spray painted warning...
