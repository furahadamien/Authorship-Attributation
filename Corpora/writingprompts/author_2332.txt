CH-LOL
As John laid there, on the cold cement floor trying to forget the pain, he noticed something.A water bottle... laying around on the floor.John mustered his last remaining energy to crawl to the water bottle.As he got there he reached for the bottle, his vision was now blurry, his arms shaking uncontrollably, his heart pounding so hard it felt like it's going to burst through his chest.He took the bottle with his right hand and pulled closer to him, he moved his left hand to the top of the bottle, gripped the cap, and twist as hard as he could.But no matter how hard he twisted, the cap still remained on top of the bottle.John has used all the his energy, his arms were motionless, his heart came to a near sudden stop, his vision blinded.He was hopeless but managed to project out his last words, 

"shit, its a crown cork".
