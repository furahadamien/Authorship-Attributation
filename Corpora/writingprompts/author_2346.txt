*New York City, New York*

Leonardo always wanted to visit New York City at the turn of the century.It was something he had been dreaming of doing ever since he had first invented Time Travel.As, he realized, he had come from a time where America was long gone and the relics of the past outweighed the creations of the future.But the turn of the millennia, with the world on edge; he had to see that.And see it he did.The populated streets of New York City were a sight to see in themselves.For the first time in his life, Leonardo had seen more people packed into a small urban island than in his entire nation.And the people themselves were *different.* Drunk, sure, but they had a way about them that spoke of their luck and class.That told of their eagerness to let things go and forget about their problems on the dawn of a new age.They, he realized, didn't have problems like those of his people.He had walked--it was more like a powerful and continuous shove--through the streets towards the address given to him by a friend.He had met him long ago, in an age forgotten by the citizens of this city and country.Yet he knew he'd be there, he promised he would.He had gone back too, about three dozen years like Jeremiah said to, and notified the man where he would meet him in the years' to come.The Jeremiah of 1964 seemed to know Leonardo already.And he judged that their paths would cross--or more likely *had* crossed--again.It was a small place compared to the luscious grandeur of New York City.A 'dive' as Jeremiah explained that sat neatly between 1st Ave and Avenue C. Yet, even with the address and time, it took Jeremiah almost an hour to get there.Most of that was due to his bewilderment, where every so often he would stand and stare  at people or things he had never seen.Statues, monuments, 'neon' signs, and cigarettes.They checkered New York City like venison and fur checkered his own nation.The bar wasn't crowded like the rest, but it was still filled.And it took Leonardo some time to find his American ID--the one that Jeremiah had helped him forge--in his bag of Travelling gear.By the time he had it, the bouncer, already annoyed, had simply let him in.It was lit dimly and a large cloud of smoke covered most of Leonardo's view, but towards the back, under a small *Smoking Area* sign sat the man.He wore an over sized blue suit, blue tie, and his hair was slicked backwards.It was long, longer than any time Leonardo had seen Jeremiah.Yet, it wasn't the outfit or the hair that told him it was his friend.It was the eyes.The eyes that he could see clearly through the fog that said "I have seen things.I have been here before.I will be here after."He walked up to the table, a single spare chair sat at the other end, and he took a seat.Jeremiah lifted his head, smirked, and slid his cigarette box over to Leonardo."Take one," the voice was rugged and dry.It was Jeremiah alright.Leonardo obliged and took a cigarette.Jeremiah was the one to light it for him, after his own, and the two took a deep inhale.Leonardo coughed his out loudly and Jeremiah blew the smoke out of his nose calmly."You made it," Jeremiah said."I did.""Like what you see?""I'm not entirely sure.It's grandiose, to say the least."He blew smoke, "Grandiose is a good word, I'd say.""How long has it been?""Oh, give or take five years.You visited me in ninety-five.""I did?"Jeremiah ashed his cigarette over the tray, "Aye.Won't happen for *you* for a while.I think after you visit Rome, you come back.""Oh?""You talk about the similarities.""Between this place and Rome?""Well," he shrugged and waved his hand to a waitress, "America and Rome."The waitress stepped up to the table, "What can I get you gentlemen?""My friend and I will have a Scotch, neat.Side of ice.""Mhm," she didn't write anything down, but pointed to the television over her shoulder, "Countdown starts soon.""Thank you, love."She left and Leonardo said, "This is only the third time, you know."He blew smoke, "I do.But I've seen you plenty of times.Imagine I'll see you plenty more.""Where have I gone?""Oh, where haven't you gone, Leo."The drinks came and Jeremiah paid with a rectangular piece of plastic and a few dollars for the waitress."Rome, Greece, London, Moscow, Beijing, you hit them all.""Over the course of?""Centuries, I presume.I mean, it is your mission to find answers, no?Drink your Scotch, it's impolite."Leonardo obliged.He had let his cigarette burn out and he mushed it into the ash tray while he sipped.He was used to alcohol, and the kind his nation brewed was much stronger than this."Well, yes, but--"

"Oh but nothing.You need answers.You go where you need to go."He smoked again, "Besides, you don't need me to tell you where or how--hell, you have the how better than I do.""Yes, but--"

"And don't try to ask me again.I told you all I know.Have been for years."Leonardo frowned, "I wouldn't know that.""No I don't suppose this one would, but *you* eventually will.""When?"Jeremiah's eyebrows lifted and he drank his scotch."There you go again."He resolved to sit back in his chair and drink.Jeremiah had obviously seen him, the future-him, many times in the past.And he wouldn't understand that until he went through the motions.Until he did what future-him did.Time Travel, as it was, was as confusing in practice as it was in theory."Ten, nine, eight--"

The crowd behind him began.He turned to Jeremiah, who was turning his drink in his hand.The man had seen civilization rise, and he would see it fall.He had that power as an immortal, and Leonardo, well he had that power too as a time traveler.But it was much different.They both knew that.Leonardo only hoped he wouldn't always be the one to ask questions.

"--Two, one, Happy New Year!""Happy New Year, old friend," Jeremiah said and clinked his glass to Leonardo's."Happy New Year."The two sat in silent as the party behind them raged on.All in all, Leonardo felt cheated.He knew the future-Jeremiah, the one had met in his time, knew all of this happened, but never mentioned it.And yet, he felt unexpectedly depressed at the feeling of seeing New York City in, what he imagined, was its prime.Then again, he could have had the dates wrong.Perhaps its prime was a hundred years into the past, or a hundred years into the future.He would have to travel to learn that."You best be going," Jeremiah said as he finished his drink."You have a lot of time to cover, and only one lifetime to do it.""Then help me.""I am.""How?""I'm telling you to do it."Leonardo chuckled, "That's not helping.""It is where I come from.""That is?"Jeremiah stayed silent.He looked Leonardo into the eyes."I visit you, don't I?""What did I say about questions?""Fine," Leonardo finished his drink so as to not be rude and smiled."I'll see you soon then.""For you maybe.Where will you go next?"Leonardo didn't have an answer for that one.Instead, he took a deep breath and searched his mind."Greece would be a nice start, I guess.Though, I'll need to learn the language."Jeremiah leaned forward and scribbled some information on a piece of paper, "London University, not sure which of these years would be best, but you can learn Greek and Latin quickly."He slid it over, "I'm sure.""Thank you.""Aye," he checked his watch, "best be off now.Good luck."Leonardo smiled and took the note.He left without saying another word, after all, it wasn't a goodbye really.He'd see Jeremiah again.In some time or another.As he walked off, another gentlemen approached Jeremiah's table and took a seat where Leonardo had left.He wore a clean, cut suit with a sharp tie and didn't hesitate in removing a box of cigarettes and lighting one for himself and Jeremiah."Too long?""On the contrary, my good friend," the gentlemen said, "you did excellent.Impeccable timing, I'd say."Jeremiah smoked the cigarette given to him."So why are you back, Leo?"The gentlemen lifted his head to reveal the same blue eyes that had just left.Albeit, this man had a little more facial hair and was, to Jeremiah's estimates, about ten years older, but it was Leonardo."We need to talk.""About what?""Now, now, Jeremiah.Don't you hate questions?"________
