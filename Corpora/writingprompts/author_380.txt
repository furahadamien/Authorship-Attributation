"28 today," you say to yourself looking in the mirror.Of course you know today is your birthday today, but it also helps that while looking at the mirror you noticed the number above your head changed from the [27] you saw yesterday.You leave to go to the liquor store to pick up some booze and celebrate.While in line you see this scrawny kid two prople ahead of you.He looks really nervous, you laugj yo youself when you figure out why as you look above his head.[17].The kid gets to the counter, hands the clerk his "ID," who says that he better run before he calls the police.The kid scurries away.It's always been a gift of yours to be able to see the age of people.Thanks to your gift it was pretty simple to find a job befitting of it to get out of doing some actual work.What better fit that a bouncer for a bar.Besides this gift you were also gifted with size, 6'6 and 300 lbs was another big help when applying to be a bouncer.With your secret ability you became well known in town as THE bouncer.Sure you looked at ID's of anyone over 21, just to keep up appearences, but anyone you saw abover their head <21 you wouldn't even ask em for ID's you'd just laugh and tell them to leave.After a nice day drinking with friends you were unfortunately scheduled to work.Luckily things are going very smooth this night, no one <21.A couple hours pass and way down the line you see [31], [33], [11], [34], and you think to yourself, "seriously, someone is trying to bring their kid into this bar?Some people."In your state there is a bery clear law disallowing children to be in a bar unless it's a bar/restaurant, which your place was most certainly not.The line moves on and on and you get more annoyed prepping to confront this family.As they get closer you see the something is a miss.The [11] is just as tall if not taller than the other numbers you see.You can't quite see the kids face but you assume he's either a really lanky kid or he's getting a piggy back ride from daddy.You think the latter is more likely because the [11] is very close to the [34].When the "kid" makes it to you your jaw drops.Standing in front of you was a man, dressed in sharp suit and nearly as tall as you, maybe 6'4.Above his head read [11....34].....[1134].The silence of your stare was then broken, "You alright buddy?"You snap back to your senses, "yeah sorry about that, may I see your ID."The man gives you his ID and it clearly shows "34," you hold his ID for a while again your mind questioning what you saw.Never before have you doubted your powers, could they be off for once?Maybe the booze from earlier is still running its course, but I feel fine.Also I've never had a problem with the accuracy of my ability before when I've been drunk.Also I've read everyone elses accurately tonight as you always check ID's anyw...

"You know I'm lying about my age on there, don't you?"The man said snapping you out your train of thought.He takes his ID and goes to walk past you away from the entrance.As he passes you he whispers in your ear, "[1134] is right, meet me out back and I'll explain everything," and with that he leaves you mouth agape walking away down the alley next to the bar.You stand there for a sec frozen by what he said until the next guy says, "buddy you alright?""No, sorry," and with that you page for someone to switch you out for a break.Your friend comes out and you go on your break.You go down the alleyway and popout behind the bar.Back there you see the only person there, the man in the trench coat."Glad you showed up."The man steps closer to you and extends his bare hand for a handshake.You look down and nervously reach out to meet his.You grip his hand and he grips yours, only he keeps squeezing, harder, and harder.Your a big guy you're not about the be intimidated in a strength contest, and you start squeezing back.The man doesn't flinch and he begins squeeze even harder, he begins crushing your hand, it's your complete loss as you fall to your knees you hand limp yet still in this man's machine like hand.He eventually lets go and you bring your throbbing hand to your chest clutching it due to the pain of broken bones."What are you?"You say through gritted teeth.The man crouches down to meet your gaze."The name's Egan, seeing the numbers are just the start of your abilities.Why do you think you would be able to see them?"He pauses, as if looking for a response to his rhetorical question.Obviously you don't know why you were given this power.Breaking the silence Egan says softly, "It's because you also have the ability to take theirs.Come with me and I'll teach you to become a god among mortals."With that Egan stands up and reaches out his left hand to you.You take it and stand up, your life changed forever.
