The snow was deep.Almost a foot of powder topped with a thin sheen of ice the brief polar sunrise had melted and re-frozen.Now it was a long dusk, the sun just peeking over the horizon.The tight evergreen forest was flooded with a deep gloom, slim trees casting inky shadows in a dizzying tapestry over the uneven terrain.A group of five crept across the top of the snow, their decades-old Tennier snowshoes leaving an inch-deep trail.The one in front was leading the others by a good forty paces, short legs churning over the lumpy, deeply unstable terrain.She was a woman, though her kit was identical to the four taller men who tailed her, spread out in a tight fan across the woods.Her purposeful hazel eyes flitted  brightly over the terrain.She thinks fondly of a baggy, stained, off-white Arctic camouflage coverall she used in 1984, rescuing skiers from terrorists in Gstaad.In that she could get within ten feet of someone before they saw her, not that they frequently did.Today they all wore matched grey winter gear with bulky Kevlar plate vests on top.They were very visible against the blanket of white.It was the closest they had, and all they had when they were besieged here six months ago.They had been following a herd of deer for thirty five miles now, and they were desperately hungry.They had been trying to force them over the ridge for three hours so they could form up and get all twelve, which would make enough stew to last them until they got another shipment of rice.Now was their chance.They began to spread out along the sharply inclined edge, and point their weapons at the herd as it passed silently along, 200 yards from them.Their first volley hit all at once, six deer snapping queerly as bullets hit their heads, hearts, chests, lungs and thighs.Five fell dead on the spot.One, hit in the back and leg, sprinted off.The rest bolted, but the team on the ridge led them expertly.They fell in their stride.The leader dropped her rifle back on its sling over her shoulder, and saw the last wounded deer as it limped away, stumbling over its bleeding front leg.She tensed, and leapt off the ridge.She sailed outwards in a smooth practiced arc, passing narrowly between two tall firs and rolling forward with a soft *whomp*, her landing a poised forward roll, rifle tucked expertly at her side.She lifted her hands in front of her and felt for the bullets in the air.A familiar feeling of electricity and tightness fell on her arms all the way back through her shoulders.They were faint, but she had them.She felt their familiar crystalline perfect structure, though it was weak.These bullets had been used far too many times.She brought her hands sharply downward  to the snow.She felt the  structure collapse, just for a moment.As it reformed in her closed hands she heard the soft *hiss* of hot blood on the snow, followed by the dull *thump* of the deer hitting the ground.She stood.The others had descended the ridge in a series of long leaps down its rocky side.They had power, yes, but it was a faint chip of ice white diamond in a stone where she was pure, refined steel.She called over her shoulder, marching briskly towards the felled herd."Whoever missed their deer comes with me to dress it.I think I blew the gut sack apart to bring him down.The rest of you, dress these double time.We're too far out.I'm gonna find how far forward they've moved the line."The state police of New Atlanta city, a small natural gas refining town some eight hundred miles south where they lived, had set a "safety perimeter" around their fortress.Big men with big guns and big jeeps that wanted them dead.What was left of the government's experiment with genetic advancement lived in a 1200 mile "reserve" at the foot of a mountain near the Arctic national wildlife preserve.The concrete brutalist hunk that ran six miles into the side of the mountain.Unfortunately, the powerful government that made them was gone and men with means thought them unnatural and offensive.As she approached the deer, she saw that her explosive removal of the bullets had ruptured  her belly, spreading a trail of clotted gore and bright Crimson.Maybe they were offensive.Unbidden her mind brought an image.A vignette, of her landing in a courtyard.That same tight roll, feeling with her power for the guns strapped across the chest of the guards, and spearing them through them.They had turned to liquid spears of stratified gray metal, plastic handles cracking and clattering to the ground.Then the blood, there was always blood.She felt the fury, an electricity rising in her."Be calm" she thought, and felt for the droplets of liquid bullet that littered  the foot of the deer.They came to her, her fury and fear eclipsed by the practiced grace of her power.Calm, yes, that's what she needed.After two, maybe four more forms this metal would disintegrate like dust, chemical bonds bereft of force.It swirled out of the snow to her, and wrapped snuggly around her wrist in a  thin, silver bracelet.Corporal Sebastian Salud was behind her now.The bracelet shivered, then stayed firm.She had two emergency ingots of pure platinum strapped to her thighs under her gear, which blazed brightly over the faintness of the heavily re-used bullets.Salud also wore a brace of gold jewelry under his uniform.She felt it blazing there, like she had felt his gold tooth blazing twenty five years ago when they were trapped in a flooding sewer tunnel.She had used it to make a key to let them out through a stand pipe."Sorry ma'am.", he said curtly "long day.""It's no problem, just get it done."She patted his arm, he thumped her shoulder."Ears open."She cautioned, "I'll be back" 

She strode off, straight along the run the wounded deer was taking to where the ridge turned and rose another eighty Stoney feet.As she walked, she pulled a laminated map card from a pocket.They were almost a hundred miles from their defensive perimeter, and twelve miles into the last recorded "by order of" sign the state police had put up, telling us where our territory now ended by their calculation.A hundred miles for twelve deer.Not a good deal.She pocketed the map as she arrived at what could now be called a cliff.Three smooth, long leaps later, toes only finding a tiny indentation and sending each falling to the earth in a cloud of dust, she landed at the topmost point.She was still strong, but she was starving.Everyone at home was starving too.The woods opened a little up here, wide and clear.She moved forward at a steady clip.She would see the sign in big blaze orange from a few hundred yards out, warning people they were a few miles from safety.The woods were pillowy silent.Nothing moved but her, and the sound of her breath was deafening in her ears.Something was up.She felt them before she saw them.Eight guns, close by.She wasn't searching for them.Foolish.Of course they'd have know about a herd of deer in their valley.She brought her M16 up to her shoulder.It was a ship of Theseus, as she had been issued an M16 in 1972.No original parts remained, but she had never really lost the rifle.She had formed it many desperate times, always replacing a myriad of parts when she ripped the barrel off to throw a frightened bolt of twisted steel.It had glass sight drilled way back on the top mount.She crept forward.She called to the woods.
