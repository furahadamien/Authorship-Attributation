As I read through the title of the "writing prompt" on Reddit, I couldn't help but feel astounded at how vacuous I was as an individual.Yet perhaps, vacuous is not the correct word to be used; for that which is empty may yet be filled.Rather than merely empty, a husk or a shell, I was filled with a feeling of resentment.What could displace a feeling of resentment born of the individual recognition that you had not only failed to not do what you knew for a fact was right but also that you did what you knew for a fact was wrong?To resent one-self for their weakness, then, to once again resent them for wallowing in self-pity and brooding over their misery.When you become the jailor, prisoner, judge, jury and executioner, the warden of your own cell.The bars, key and lock of your own make.The maker of appeals you devise, file and reject.That, is true damnation.Yet you parade your cage around, gilded in a thin veneer of vanity, of arrogance born of an intellectual sciolisism.Masquerading a sickly and cruel nature from those closest to you.Playing the jester even though you're naught but a fool.Yet here you are, once again confronted by the darkness you resent but that you hold oh-so-dear, because without it there would be nothing, and as you know bitterness and resentment are preferable to nothingness.I read the sheets of my mind with these words filling them.Yet as I read, I could not move my eyes from the one page book marked aeons ago.A page simply titled hope, a word so blindingly filled with light; it could illuminate and elucidate not only the darkness but fill the emptiness as well.If only for a moment.Yet it is for these movements that I or maybe you, dear reader, live.If nothing else the wish to reach that light is enough to keep the darkness at bay, for just one more day, and who knows, maybe, just maybe, one day is all you need to wake up, wake up and find the way, find the answer, live that effervescent truth.
