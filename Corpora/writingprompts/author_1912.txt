I mean yeah, eventually they all die, but that doesn't mean I can't save a few from dying young.Let me elaborate: I have been around for quite some time and although I lack the mortality that my patients have, I haven't let this endless existence strip me of my humanity.I just can't bear to see them suffer I guess.And I'm not going to brag or anything but I've had to take on multiple identities throughout the years because of some of the advancements I've personally been responsible for in emergency medical assistance.I wasn't always a paramedic, first I was a doctor.Although good doctors are always needed, I personally felt like I could make a better impact in the emergency field, particularly in a setting with less resources to pull from.So let me start from the beginning.It was the early 1900s.The Great War, or what we now know as World War 1, had just begun.I was there as a combat medic, leaving my setting in my office to try and serve my country against the German onslaught that was coming.In the first 30 minutes I saw more men fall than I hope to ever see again as our machine guns sprayed rounds across the bridge on the outskirts of town.No matter how many were taken down though, their ranks seemed to be endless and eventually it seemed like our battle had changed favors.Soon I was sprinting with my partner to grab wounded men by stretcher and Sprint as best as we could off the main battlefield and to where we could tend to them.And there on that battlefield is where I got the first taste of my curse.Bullets hurt, and they're very hot.But when I was shot, no matter how much I bled out all that would happen is I would black out and then I would come to hours later usually laying in the same spot I "died" in.So fast forward a few years later, I'm used to my blessing of I'm mortality as I thought of it at the time.Trench life sucks.But here I am with this inability to die, so I volunteered to be a field medic on the most dangerous parts of our global conflict.And I'm proud to say, as a pacifist, that I never killed a soul.A luxury I may not have had, were I capable of dying.Decades later in the cannabis fields of Vietnam I pioneered the idea to use marijuana as a tool to treat PTSD.Those poor young men didn't ask for that war.And not a single soul on this planet was ready for the soul destroying conflict that it was.And here I sit today, passenger seat of an ambulance in LA.2019.I've been alive for almost 140 years.I've been 30 for almost 110.Haven't gotten so much as a gray hair or wrinkle.Every so often I move to another part of the world, just so people don't get suspicious of my age.But here in lies the main problem I have.Sometimes I come up on a scenario where the number of patients overwhelms the amount of resources available.Known to EMTs and paramedics as MCI or multiple casualty incidents.In those moments my "lizard brain" takes over, and by that I mean I start to act purely on instinct and a few times have implemented certain techniques from back in 'Nam or even worse back from the trenches.Nothing ever happened to get me fired but some of my co-workers were so shocked seeing how naturally I took to some of these crude, life-saving techniques that they just stood there awestruck as I single-handedly saved a full City bus of patients before the volunteer firefighters even showed up.Implementing things that aren't even covered under my scope of practice, but the patients that I had to use such skills on weren't conscious for it.I don't even know why I am writing this even.Maybe because I'm growing tired of moving all the time.Maybe because Im bored of never getting close to anyone.Maybe because I long for a normal life.Seeing young people in love makes me wish I had had a chance at it.Maybe someday I will.But may question today, Reddit, is what should I do with my life?If I can't die, what is the best use of this power?How can I help humanity in the best possible way?Is there something better than what i am doing now, and could it be something where I can stop moving and cutting ties with everyone I know every couple of years?(Kinda went off from the prompt a little.Supposed to be posted on askreddit)
