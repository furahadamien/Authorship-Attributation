My shift is about to end, only one more minute.My boss flies above the mat manufacturing line and rings a bell.Everybody exhales nicely and we go home.The line bustles to an end and the materials are put away.Fur.Rubber.Shit like that.Shit to make mats.My boss makes a killing off these mats because the best, most experienced and skilled vampires make a killing off of the blood they get using the mats compared to vampires who need to ask to come in, befriend, and then betray their new friends when everybody goes to sleep.These other guys only have to come during the day as a mat salesman and come back later after he's taken a shit or gotten lunch.Then he drains his patrons, resells the blood for profit, gets a real human meal with the 20 bucks they score off the mat, and buys *another* mat.Fuckin geniuses.The only reason the rest of us factory workers don't do what they do is because we aren't exactly "good at selling," or   "people persons," or "human-like," or "can afford a suit, tie, and hat."Plus the mats are too fucking expensive for vampire money.Shit's like .001 on the dollar.We're basically slaves.Yet vampires.Somehow it works, stop asking questions.This week I'm planning a heist because this week's paycheck won't be enough to pay rent.I know I should lay off the take-out food but I fuckin love me some panda express.What I'll do is wait up in a tree above old man jenkin's home, the only home in town without a welcome mat.Jesse Dentine is the best vampire salesman ever and has dibs on that house.But that doesn't mean he's good at defending himself.Before he reaches the door, I'll jump his cold-blooded ass and steal the mat.Here I am up in the tree looming over the walkway up to the front door...I'm waiting and feeling a little guilty, but it's for the best because men who steal are desperate: at least that's my excuse.Here he comes.I gotta time this right.Oh fuck, if I fail i'll be found out and late on rent.oh fuck oh fuck just JUMP ALREADY.I land on top of him, crushing him into the ground.He's fuckin *dead*.Oh shit, I'm a murderer.How am I gonna cover this up?I can't leave the dead body because then human's will find out about us and kill our economy.Can you bury a vampire?What if you don't bury it 6 feet under?Will he become a zombie?Nevermind that I gotta hop Jesse and I outta here before old man jerkins finds us.. because then we'll *all* be fucked.
