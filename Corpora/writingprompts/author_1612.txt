My head hurt as I opened my eyes.The sun was shining bright overhead.It seemed warmer than I remembered it being, but at the same time, it felt familiar.What a vivid dream to wake up from.It was more elaborate than I normally experienced.More than that of finding food, more than that of finding a mate, more than just killing whoever threatened either the food or the mate.Strangely, I never remembered what was in any of these dreams when I woke up.I always liked sleeping though, and the pleasant nonsense it brought on sometimes.But never before did I remember it being so vivid.Almost... Alien.But wait, aliens just existed inside that dream.It's unbelievable how much detail I had cooked up.Well, my dream self has its answer now at least."What comes after death?", he asked himself several times near the end.Well, you wake up you idiot.I chuckled a bit at the idea.My head hurt again from the effort.It oddly felt like the effect psychedelics had on me in the dream world.It's almost surreal how all of it feels like a memory from experience than like a dream.Those mushrooms I ate last night, probably caused me to trip balls.A dream?I don't remember having that concept before this.It's... from the dream itself.Come to think of it, all of this that I'm experiencing, it's a concept from the dream.Wait... am I having an internal monologue?What's this language I'm thinking in.What's...I?I struggle to dissociate my dream life experience from the real life I've lived for the past 25 years.I remember my existence and my survival but I just couldn't remember being... conscious.Is this the answer to the question from the dream that "Humanity" struggled with?The point where we gained conscience?Argh!My head still hurts from these questions.If I was the one who dreamt it all up, I can't be the one answering the questions I created.I want to drink water now and maybe splash some water on my face to stop this thought loop I'm stuck in.I'm pretty sure I remember this feeling from both the dream and my life.So, that's a win I guess.I casually grip the branch of my tree with my feet, I swing downwards to grab the branch underneath with my hands.As I use the momentum to swing again and land on the forest floor, the realisation hits me.The dream me wasn't like... Me.Biologically.I'm closer to what the dream me would call a Hominid.But, I'm just me.Whatever that's supposed to mean.I see I've kept the sense of humour from the human life.Or rather I always did.Practical jokes at my own expense were perhaps the only reason that I had managed to keep the troop together for so long.I looked up to see the others of my kind still asleep overhead.But I'm pretty sure my fellows were those hairless, two-legged, upright idiots always fighting each other.OK.Think logically.You've been an evolutionary biologist for 60 years of your dream life.What would you make of this?Just as I was regaining my composure, the one I remembered as being my mate for this season, come down.She wants to join me for drinking I sense.Yes, going to the watering hole alone is always dangerous.But other than that urge to drink and the fear she had, I couldn't get anything from her.What made it worse, is that I am sure that is all she feels right now.And then it dawned on me.This is empathy.This is consciousness.This is the mutation that made us human.
