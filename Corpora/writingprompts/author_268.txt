I remember that the first thing i felt was a sudden tingling on the palm of my hands,after it grew stronger...and stronger until someting brilliant surged out of them.Blue flames,a ball of blue flames were floating over my very hands,they were warm but despite how close they were to my skin they didnt burned it,the felt simply warm.I was 19,so ive had seen countless spetial effect that looked like that in movies and TV series but that was just in front of me,it was real.The life/death scenario i was put on before,when that alien started to shoot his space gun or whatever the hell it was,towards me must of activated someting in me.I was sitting on the floor,the alien was running straight towards me,i was scared,surprised and confused because of that weird blue flames but i didnt had time for questions in that moment

I had the sensation that i could use them as a weapon against that thing.And if i could do that,that was the only thing i cared about in that moment.I got up on my legs even if my whole body was shaking,that might be my last moments and i havent lived all my life trough to die like that,that infuriated me i will not die here i said to myself.-Come on blue flames,show me what you can do-ive whispered to myself

The blue flames grew stronger and bigger,they were of the size of a basketball,i started to count...

1...I felt a sudden silence for a second,i threw them towars the alien while screaming,but the space gun were faster and blew up my skull.Or at least that was what I thought,with my eyes closed i was able to hear a huge explosion and felt beigh pushed back.i knew that i was alive,i was reliefed but it wasnt over yet,so then i opened my eyes and the first thing i saw was that the aliens yellow head did completely blew up with his blue body fluids all over the place and his body was laying on the floor,dead.I couldnt believe it,suddently there was a tiny ray of hope for the human race,i needed to find others like me,we really can win this war i thought to myself.As much of afraid and confused i were i absolutely knew that i had a mission from that very moment:clearing the surface of earth of that f***ing aliens.
