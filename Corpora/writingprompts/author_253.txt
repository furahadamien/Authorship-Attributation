You could feel static in the air.Vibrations rippling the surface of the ground.Like a droplet hitting calm waters.Her eyes pregnant with tears; cascading down her dirty face.If you had heard her screaming, you would feel the exact moment your heartbreaking into a thousand pieces.She croaked out the last of her voice.Sobbing her heart out, she clutches the remnants of her younger sister.Trembling and whispering so low only angels could hear "Fuck no, Jesus please.Bring her back.Fuck.this isn't fair."If given the chance she would have sat there and repeated that last sentence over a lifetime.Over and over again.If only she had been there.She would have found a small momentary haven for her and younger sister.Gemma's lifeless eyes that had once danced with a playful light despite The Day of Broken Skies had wreaked havoc on our broken world under a couple of years ago.Had now been snuffed away.Stolen from her.Sophia had never felt rage this chaotic before.The sound of her blood coursing through her veins drowned out the distant screams and please for help.Nearby a  Senty had rounded the corner, the low baritone humming as it's tracks glided over crumbling walls and rusting cars.The dome glistening as it housed this other worldly species.A language unknown warbled excitedly as it spots Sophia.Sophia couldn't hear the mechanised alien's weapon start to whir.Only when she felt searing hot air whoosh past her arm did the ground around her stop pulsing.Sophia's sadness had erupted into a deafening war cry.She abhorred them.Every last one of them.With every last molecule of her body.She went to stand up.Instead the ground rushed away from her.She was airborne and as her rage brought her to near madness.What can only be described as the sound of a sonic boom.Darkness.Sophia struggles to wake.She feebly pushes herself onto her knees.She knows she needs to run.She looks around to find shelter, only to find 100 metres of scorched earth surrounding her.What was left of the Sentinel, was a puddle of molten alien metal."What are you?"A terrified voice called from somewhere close.Sophia could only muster a whisper "please help"


Darkness.Sophia woke to the sound of metal clanging and water rushing.She couldn't see much but a sliver of light.Her migraine made her double over, groaning as she's struggled to make sense of her surroundings.The pitter patter of tiny feet and giggling could be heard running away."She's awake", "she's weird", "she looks like my sister" "she's superwoman" little eyes peered into the safety of Sophia's darkness."GET AWAY FROM THERE" A fierce growl scattered the kids in different directions.The huge metal door creaked open.A giant with a barrel chest stoops to let himself into the room.Light burns Sophia's eyes as she struggles to keep them open."So you're a Surge?"His growls rumbling as a billow of smoke floods towards Sophia.Hey guys,
