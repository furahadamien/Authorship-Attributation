What did you say?

I paused, my card already jammed into the receptacle and deducting $5.29 from my bank account.What?

The clerk stared at me, his green eyes narrowed.I drew half a step back almost unconsciously.Uh.I asked if I could have my drink cup.You guys keep making us wait and its kind of annoying.

The man stared at me, his lips pressed into a thin line.What are you doing?

All right, the guy was clearly crazy.I tore my debit card free, shoving it back into the holder permanently resting in my pocket.Im trying to get a Big Mac.Whats your problem?

Are you insane? he hissed, leaning forward across the counter.What are you *doing*?

Greg? someone called from across the store.A manager, judging by the color of their uniform.Their voice was carefully cheerful.Whats going on?

Nothing!Just helping this gentleman out, Greg said, his face snapping back to carefully neutral as he smiled at me.A plastic cup was shoved into my hands, along with the paper slip of my receipt.Look - dont be an idiot, he said, his voice dropping low enough I had to lean in to hear him.I dont know what game you think youre playing, but you cant walk in here talking gibberish.Leave me alone.

I stared at him, my mind racing, but the customers behind me were already pushing forward.I stepped back to join the others waiting for their food, my mind churning.I had a bit of a gift.Well, thats how I liked to think about it.It had taken a few years to figure out - all languages sounded exactly the same to me.No matter if I was speaking to someone blabbering on in French or chattering in Italian, it all came across as plain old English.My parents had been freaked out, understandably.It had taken a bit of doing to convince them I wasnt just crazy.And as soon as wed pieced together what was going on, wed begun hiding.It wasnt as though I could suddenly start spouting off Spanish and German, after all.We couldnt even just leave copies of Rosetta Stone lying around meaningfully.The instant someone I actually *knew* called me on it, the secret would be up.I kind of valued living a normal life, too much to allow something like that to happen.Tray in hand and my mediocre food steaming, I filed back to my seat.I could feel Gregs eyes on me the whole way - staring.What was his problem?Had I stuttered?And what had he meant, gibberish?Maybe he spoke a different language, sure,  but why would that be a problem?He should be happy that Id spoken Polish or Swahili or who-gives-a-fuck.Maybe a bit surprised, but not *angry*.His reaction wasnt normal at all.I couldnt shake the feeling that something was wrong.Normally I would have lingered, taking my time in eating.With the feeling of Clerk Asshats eyes on the back of my neck, I just wanted to leave.I shoveled my value meal down as quickly as I could, hardly tasting it.My phone lit up with notifications, friends and family blabbering away, all wanting to know where I was.When Id be finished with the days chores.Could I pick up this grocery list for them, or finish that errand?I ignored all of them.The wrapper crumpled instantly in my hand as I pushed myself upright, dumping the whole lot of it in the trash.The guy wasnt there.A bit of the tension slipped out of my shoulders as I saw his station replaced by a tiny, grinning brunette.Good.Maybe his manager had finally taken him down a notch.The lights on my car blinked across the parking lot at me as I stepped out of the store.The cold air snapped me awake, back to reality in an instant.I was letting that guy creep me out for no reason.He was just a jerk, that was all - trapped in his minimum wage job.Probably just a crazy, when I thought about it.He was probably just-

I yelped, eyes widening as fingers buried themselves in my hair, pulling painfully.Someone had me.There was something cold at my throat - cold and *sharp*.Ok, asshole, Greg hissed in my ear, his voice wild.Were going to go for a walk.

What the *fuck* are you-

Shut up.

The blade dug into my neck.I could feel a hot line of blood dripping down my skin.My mind raced - this was insane.He really was crazy.A lunatic.He was-

There was nothing I could do to fight him as he turned me, forcing me towards the back of the store.A dingy, beat-up station wagon waited in employee parking, the lot unlit and dismally dark.I scanned the lot even still, ready to bellow for help at a moments notice.It was useless.There was no one around.No one was going to hear.He slammed me into the back of his car, my face pressed painfully against the glass.How stupid do you think I am? he spat.What the *hell* are you talking about? I cried, shaking.What, you think youre being subtle?Youll just walk in, talking the Old Tongue like you were born to it, and Ill roll over for you?

Look, dude, theres been some mistake, I moaned.Its-Its just something that I can do, all right?Its not-

Right, he said with a laugh, his fingers still pulling painfully at my hair.Like Im going to believe *that*.

I speak tongues, all right? I said, craning my head until I could look at him.Thats all.I dont know what you heard.All I know is-

How long until they get here?

I blinked.What?

Im not *stupid*, he spat.Im not going to sit idly until they come to finish the job.How long until the rest of them show up?

The rest of *who*? I said, trying desperately to keep from crying.You know damn well who- he said, but stopped abruptly.I blinked.Somewhere in the distance, sirens were approaching.My heart leapt.Police.*Yes*.Someone must have seen him, someone must have called the cops.I was saved.Hed-

He let go of my hair in an instant, leaping away.His car abandoned, he vanished into the underbrush of the woods behind the McDonalds.I fell in a crumpled heap, my heart still pounding in my ears.Tires screeched as the cop car pulled up moments later, a pair of officers piling out.Sir!Sir, are you all right? one yelled, racing over to me.Can you tell me what happened?

There was- a man, I said, glancing back at the woods.H-He had a knife.He was crazy.Thought I was speaking some funny language or something.

Why would he think that? the other said, his brow furrowing.I-I dont know, I said, instinctively clamping down.The cops paused, staring at me.What, thats it? the first said.Im sorry, I muttered, unable to meet their eyes.My gaze drifted, needing to find something, anything else to look at.The flashing lights of their cars drew my eyes in, holding my gaze.I froze.Well, look.Im sure this has been a traumatic event.Why dont you come back with us, and well talk about it? The second said, smiling blankly at me.One hand dropped to his belt.Neither of them was wearing a radio.There was nothing on his belt but a gun and a pair of handcuffs.The details of it stuck out like a lightning flash in my mind.I took a step back.Look, dont worry, all right? the first said, beaming at me.Youre safe now, right?

The insignia on their car was wrong.Id lived in the town my entire life, and it was *wrong*.It didnt even have the right *name* on it.It just looked

Generic.I took another step back.The smiles were beginning to fade from their faces.Look, come on, the first said.Just take it easy, ok?Well just go for a ride.

His hand reached out, grabbing for my elbow.I skittered away before he could touch me, suddenly sure of two things.Whoever those two were, they were *not* police officers.And I was in a mess of trouble.---

The feel of blood between my fingers was repulsive.No matter how long this went on, no matter how many lives I *saved*, that never changed.The man crumpled, his eyes going wide even as every last bit of humanity seeped out of them.His lips parted, one final exhalation slipping between them.A final word?A curse?A goodbye?There was no way to tell.The dagger glinted as I pulled it free.It gleamed, lit from within by its own light.It had been studied for years, pored over by scientist after scientist.I'd been one of them, once upon a time.All that we could tell was that it had some sort of energy translation capabilities.The papers we released were filled with words like *wormholes* and *parallel universes*.We hadn't thought anything of it.It was just an oddity, a mystery from Earth's past that we couldn't explain.And then the asteroid appeared.Everyone else had panicked.The world was doomed, they said, and it was hard to argue with them.But I'd known.I couldn't tell anyone how, or why.I'd *known* that the dagger was the key to saving us.They'd disagreed.I didn't give them the chance to argue it.I'd been stealthy at first.Subtle.And then, as the asteroid loomed higher and higher overhead, my methods had slipped.The sirens rang in my ears.I was out of time - I was out of places to run.That was fine.Tomorrow was the end, anyway, if the astronomers were right.There was no reason to think they weren't.I'd done all I could.I clung to the idea, holding fast to some sort of hope.They'd be waiting for me on the other side.I *knew* they would be.They'd see I saved them.I wasn't a murderer.I'd never wanted this.I was a hero.The first police car was just skidding around the corner as I turned the blade on myself, plunging the length of steel into my neck before I could lose my nerve.---

My eyes snapped open.I gasped, my whole body shuddering.What had- What had just-

I didn't know.I couldn't explain it.But I was breathing - I was *alive*.And there was no asteroid in the sky.The street around me was different.Busier.More lively.I smiled, honest relief sliding onto my face.The Earth lived.I'd done it.I'd-

"It's *you.*"

At the sound of a voice, I flinched, and then turned.A man stood a few paces back, his eyes wide and terrified.I smiled, holding a hand up."Don't worry.I'm not-"

His fist slammed into my cheek a moment later.I hit the ground hard, biting off a strangled cry.The voices rose around me - confusion.Fear.Questions, and cries for the police.But here and there, I heard it."It's *him*.""He's the one.I *remember.*"

I tried to push myself upright.This wasn't right.I was the hero, dammit.I'd saved them.With a knife.The thought echoed in the back of my mind, chilling me to the bone.I'd saved them with a *knife*, and they *might* not appreciate that as much as I'd thought.I tried to cry for help.I tried to tell them it was all a mistake.It vanished in a gurgle as a boot planted itself in my stomach.They closed in around me, blocking out the sun."Welcome to the other side," the man said, grinning."We've been *waiting* for you."(/r/inorai, critique always welcome!)

The three looked between each other.There was no more time for words.No more words were necessary.They knew their places.Jesus swung into the driver's seat.It was the only real place for him, and there wasn't another option, when it came right down to it.Buddha didn't fit behind the wheel, and they'd both seen Satan at work on that flask inside his jacket through the day.No, Jesus would handle it.Their wheels spun on the gravel.The others were circling, now.It was time.The final battle, the final fight to see who would win the game once and for all.Jesus and Satan teaming up was a given.The other candidates had complained - it wasn't fair - but complaining got them nowhere.They all tried to pretend like they weren't going to do the exact same thing as soon as the opportunity presented itself.They looked between each other edgily, sizing the competition up.Picking teams.Buddha, on the other hand, was a surprise.What incentive did *he* have for working together with the terrible twosome?His smooth, expressionless face gave no hint of an answer as he clambered all the way up behind the gun mounted in the truck bed.His bare feet were steady on the metal floor, perfectly centered even as his girth swung disconcertingly."Here they come!"Satan roared.He had elected himself shot-caller, of course, even though they hadn't set teams.Neither of the other two were surprised by *that*, either.He'd always needed to have the last word on things.The first contenders were approaching.Muhammed was out front, leaning out the side door of a torn-up station wagon.He clutched a rocket launcher in his hands.They could see Shiva behind the wheel, grinning like a madcap as he spun the wheel.The overburdened little car nearabouts rode up on two wheels as they whipped into a donut."Shoot!Shoot!Now, goddammit!Why aren't you shooting yet?!"Satan screamed.Jesus gritted his teeth, choosing to ignore the fact that his father's name was being taken in vain alongside him.Buddha was just watching, sizing up the shot.And then his meaty finger gripped the trigger.The roar of the gun was deafening.Satan clapped his hands over his ears, roaring with laughter as the gleaming, glowing rounds arced out towards the station wagon.Shiva was swearing - they could see that much, even though his words were lost to distance and the racket.But they were spinning too fast.The ground between them erupted into shredded sand and mud.Muhammed wasn't waiting anymore.A plume of fire shot from the rocket launcher.Everything happened all at once, after that."Satan!"Jesus cried.He, too, was turning now, but there was only so much he could be expected to do.He was supposed to be positioning them to attack.Defending them was-

"I got it, I got it!Don't get your robes in a bunch."Satan hissed.Defending them was *his* job.He lurched dangerously in his seat, barely holding on.But he pulled his hand up into an almost-level position, mimicking a gun."Bang."Red circles appeared endlessly around their truck.Something was coming up from underground."*Damn* it, Satan.Do you have to-"

"Don't complain, big guy.Left.Left.Go-"

The truck whipped into a left-hand turn, narrowly avoiding the black pillars shooting up around them.Jesus shook his head."I've *got it*.Stop backseat driving."The other teams were coalescing, now.One after another, the deities were lining up for the big fight.They all knew.Whoever won this, would win the world.And none of them wanted to lose.He could almost see them, if he squinted.Four sets of hooves, barely visible under the cloudline where they floated.Watching.Waiting.The final fight, for whoever crushed the competition here.He winced.The little station wagon had just been slammed by a hummer.He could see Ra through the front window, glowing faintly from the shit-eating grin on his face.Oddly noodle-like tentacles were swarming out of the vehicle, attaching themselves to the station wagon.Which seemed to be *vanishing* into the mass of pasta."Drive!Drive!"Satan screamed in his ear.The roar of the chaingun from the truck bed was almost a constant companion, now.Jesus grinned, flexing his hands on the wheel.And then he drove.(/r/inorai, critiques always welcome.And going to head it off, I know that Buddha isn't really the fat jolly man statue most people associate with it, but, *most people associate that with him*.)~~Note - Another part or two is a possibility tonight when I get home, although this won't for obvious reasons be a long term project beyond that.If you want to be notified *should* that second part happen, leave a comment in the thread about this post on my sub.It's linked above :) I will notify anyone in that thread re: updates.~~

You know, I really couldn't say when I first saw the lines.I mean, sure, I know it was sometime around my tween years when I saw them for *sure*.I was 13 when I saw the brightly colored lines cutting straight across the gravel parking lot, leading me back to my parents after I had gotten lost on that road trip.But before that?I really couldn't say.Maybe I had seen them before, mistaking them for pavement lines and supermarket markings.Regardless.After I noticed them, I couldn't help it.I saw them *everywhere*.Two lines, red and green, etched into the ground like they were marked in paint.No one else could see them.I'd commented on them once, to my mother, and she looked at me like I was crazy.I was old enough at that point to know to keep my mouth shut.But I watched, as they wove their way in and out of my life.And, as one does, I inevitably found myself overwhelmed with the *need* to investigate them, to see where they led.The curiosity was more than I could take.The memory of that first time was too fresh in my mind, of the green line leading me straight back to safety.And so, when I was 14, I grabbed a botle of water and a snack, and I followed them.The green line, of course.Green is good and red is bad, right?It just seemed smarter that way.It had taken me on a winding, twisting path, deeper and deeper into the city, until at last I found myself at a robotics tournament being held that afternoon.It was *thrilling*.I had no idea that something like that was even a thing, but my interest was piqued.I decided - I wanted to do something like *that* with my life.And I looked at that little green line with newfound respect.So I followed it again.Over and over, I followed it.And time after time, my life was rewarded for it.It took me to the front door of a prep school where I met Mr. Graves, whose tutoring I hold directly responsible for getting me into college a few years down the road.It led me out of danger, as a kitchen fire burned out of control in my school.And, it crossed my path with that of the woman of my dreams.Literally.We smacked into each other in a crosswalk.So, here I was.I was 30, and the world was at my fingertips.I sat in my leather gaming chair, in front of the desk holding all of my equipment.I looked out the window of my top-floor penthouse, gazing down at the city below.The walls were covered with the awards I had won, in automation and robotics and system design.My lovely, smart, beautiful wife was in the other room, reading a book as she brewed coffee.It was perfect.Really perfect.All thanks to that little green line.But I couldn't help it.I was *bored*.My whole adult life, I'd relied on that invisible line to guide my steps.It hadn't bothered me when I was younger.I was just a kid, and this line opened doors for me I didn't even know *existed*.I'd followed it without hesitation, trusting it to take my life where it needed to go.Now that I was older, now that I had time to stop and think about it, I wondered if this had all really been for the best.Had I just taken the easy path?Had I gone with the flow, and given up on taking my life into my own hands?It kept me up at night, I'll be honest.And through it all, it burned, in the corner of my vision.That red line.It seared into my sight like it was on *fire*.It demanded attention, begging for me to give it the shot I'd only ever given its green brother.That old curiosity was back.And so I grabbed an old messenger bag out of the closet, a remnant from my college days.I threw in bottles of water, and a pocket knife.A charge cable for my phone, and a granola bar.I laughed to myself, as I saw it.It looked so much like the bag I had packed, all those years ago, when I first walked the green line.But that felt right, you know?I slipped out the door, with a quick goodbye to my wife.She accepted my excuses of taking a walk without hesitation, pressing a kiss to my cheek and wishing me a good day.I smiled to myself, as I left the house.She was the best thing that the green line had ever gotten me.And then I stepped onto the red line.Once again, it led me into the city, deeper and deeper.But where the green line had taken me straight towards the center of activity, leading me towards schools and conference centers, the red line seemed to be taking me right to the worst part of town.I flinched away from seedy glares, eyeing my bag and the make of my coat, as I hurried onwards.I hoped this wasn't going to be the last mistake I ever made.The buildings around me loomed higher, the roads and streets giving way to narrow alleys.I was *about* to give up, to declare this a fool's errand and turn back.And then I heard her crying."Please.Please, no.I swear I won't say anything.I don't have any money, I- I don't have *anything*.Please just let me go and I swear I won't ever-"

"Shut it."The woman's voice was high, reedy with fear, and her tears threatened to overwhelm her words entirely.It stopped me in my tracks, before I even had a chance to hear *him* speak.The voices were coming from ahead.The red line burned, inviting me onwards.Almost against my will, I found my feet moving fowards.And then I saw her, huddled on the ground in a mass of scarf and hair.A man was in front of her, kneeling, with her purse torn open in front of him.He dug through it, tossing receipts and makeup cases aside carelessly as he looked for anything valuable.In his other hand, he held a gun.It pointed at her lazily, weaving back and forth as he eviscerated the bag.They were right there, no more than twenty feet in front of me.Neither of them saw me.The man's back was to me, and the woman was in no state to notice.My hand plunged into the bag slung over my shoulder, latching reflexively around the familiar shape of my knife.I didn't know what I was going to do with it, but having it in my hand made me feel a *little* better.I needed to call the cops.This was all wrong.There was no way I could do anything to help her.I was just going to end up getting her killed, or myself, or both of us.He had a *gun*.What could I *possibly* do against-

His hand swayed, the barrel pointing back at her.His finger tensed on the trigger.Before I had time to think, I was running.The knife was out of the bag now, gleaming in my hand as I thrust it towards him.Towards his neck.If I could knock him over, if I could get that gun pointed *away* from her-

I swore colorfully as I stumbled.The man grunted in surprise and pain, as my knife dug into his wrist.I winced, even as I ran headlong into him.Turns out my aim with a knife *sucked*.But it got the job done.He fell, cursing and screaming, as blood flowed from his wrist.The gun clattered to the cold pavement, forgotten, as he stumbled back.His eyes were locked onto my knife, through the mist of pain I could see in his expression."What the *fuck*?"He cursed again, clutching his wrist."Dude, fuck *off*."I swiped the knife at him clumsily, more threatening than actually intending to hit him.He swore one last time, jumping back."Fuck this.Keep your shitty purse, lady."With one last parting jab, he spun on his heel and vanished rapidly down the alleys.The woman was a mess, eyes all red and sniffling desperately.But she pulled herself together as I approached her, beginning to tuck her belongings back into her bag."Are...are you ok, ma'am?"I asked tentatively, my voice low.She glanced up at me, smiling."I am now.That asshole.I- I was so *scared*.Thank you *so* much.Thank you.I don't know what would have happened if you-"  

"Don't worry about it.I'm glad I was here.We should get you to the police."I cut her off before she could go on.I knew the signs of an incoming meltdown, and figured I needed to get her somewhere safe before her emotions finally caught up with the shock.She nodded, accepting my offered hand with a grateful nod, and we stumbled onwards down the alley.I glanced dowards.The red line glowed brightly ahead of us.My stomach roiled.*More*?The noise of the city was returning to normal around us, as we returned to some semblance of civilization.I began to relax, just a hair.And then, as we turned towards the main street, I hesitated.The red line was turning, down a different alley.It led half a block down, and then cut straight up to the front door of a little shack.I could see a tiny, hazy tendril of smoke, rolling out from under the side door.The line *burned*, screaming red in its urgency.It seared a line into my vision as I looked down the alley.I paused, caught deep in thoughts.Questions, that had been lingering in my head for years, and answers that had suddenly become apparent.The green line took me where *I* needed to go.It showed me the easy path.The path that I needed to take.What if...What if the red line showed me the hard path?Not the path that I needed, but the path that other people needed me to take?What if it took me to where other people needed me to go?"Can you manage from here?"I heard my voice say, ringing distant in my own ears.The woman glanced back to me, smiling faintly."I think so.Do you have to go?""I..I think I do, yeah."I didn't look back at her.My eyes were still locked onto that little building.The smoke was growing, swelling by the second.I half turned, releasing the woman's hand and giving her a reassuring smile.She returned it shyly, waving as she merged back into the flow of pedestrians and made for the police station.I turned back to the red line.And then I broke into a run.---
