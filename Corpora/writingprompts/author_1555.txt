*There they are.Run little insects, run.*

Death looked at the green and blue sphere that was suspended in front of him.He circled it, looking at all the billions of little microscopic creatures.He watched them scurry around, seemingly aimlessly.*Their lives have no meaning.I could kill them all, just with one little flick of a finger.*

Death lightly flicked a blue part of the sphere, the blue overtook part of the green.Death watched in sadistic amusement as the little black specs running through the green were washed away.It gave him pleasure, having control over such inferior creatures.Excitement bubbled inside him as he reached for a lighter and flicked it on.He gently pressed the lighter against a green area and watched it slowly catch fire.He loved watching the black specs scramble, watch them surround the fire and eventually make is subside.Death heard someone coming and quickly hid the sphere under his robe, careful to not kill all of his little science experiments.*Shit, she's coming*

"Death Jr.!Have you been playing with that Earth thing again?"The woman stood in the dark room, her green dress and smooth skin stood out among the solemn decorum."No, ma.I swear I wasn't.""What's under your robe?"She gestured for him to give up whatever he was holding."Ah, ma.I was just having a little fun."Death Jr. handed over the blue and green sphere."Look what you've done to the little thing!"She motioned to the charred part, a black scar was left where the lighter had touched.She gently blew toward the scorched piece and it suddenly sprang back to an elegant green."No more playing for you, Mr." She stomped out of the room, sphere in hang.*I'll get it back later.After all, killing is my nature.It's just too fun.*
