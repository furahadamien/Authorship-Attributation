Two minutes til the witching hour... and still stuck in this damn "quick play" queue."Come on.I can't be the only one on."There was an option to leave the queue, but then I'd lose my place in line and probably end up waiting for longer.*Match found*

A relieved burst of air leaves my nostrils."Nobody better have picked Sombra..."

"Goddamn motherfucking Comcast"

My eyes shot to the sporadically blinking modem.*in my shittiest Irish accent*
"Have you tried turning it off and on again?"*buzzbuzz*

"DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON"


"Uh"

..."Its a beautiful night tonight.Look outside"...The first thing to try to escape was my skin.It rippled up and down my body, convulsing my arm and launching my phone across the room.I dove for my bedroom.Safety in the sheets, right?Though my head was fully buried in blankets I felt something... something repetitive... something... broken.I peered from beneath my comforter.My window glowed bright and faded.Brighter.And dark again.I didn't get the second warning, but the next day I would find it again on my phone.1-800-comcast

"DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON"


It was difficult to say if what I did counted as looking at the moon.But when I opened my curtains and looked up at the bright orb in the sky I saw no moon.Just a big white flashing rectangle.On.Off.On.Off."Must have internet connection to stream moon.wmv"
