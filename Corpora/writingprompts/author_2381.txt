"Oah!"Says the time traveler, 

"Yoah!"Replies the immortal, Steve, already approaching the time traveler."How do you always know where I'm gonna be when I'm time traveling?"Asks the time traveler."You're always in the same spot where you time travelered last" Says Steve."Oah!"Says the time traveler.There was a long pause as both parties looked around, feet planted where they met.Steve was on his knees before the time traveler sobbing, "It's so fucking lonely!Human existence was destroyed hundreds of years ago, I've gotten so bored I started eating dirt and so depressed I sank myself into the bottom of the ocean, but IT WON'T STOP!!!!PLEASE STAY WITH ME FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT!""Damn no people?That's boring.Sorry I'd love to stay and chat but time is money."With that, the time traveler disappeared.Steve was alone once again.His entirety was torn on whether to stay and wait for the time traveler or try again the things he's already done.Steve sat down.He'd see him again soon.
