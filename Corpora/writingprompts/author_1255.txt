It was just a series of words on a screen, a collection of pixels coloured in a certain pattern - a passing remark made by someone who, when all was said and done, had no idea who I was, who any of us were.Yet as I read their simple message, I felt a warmth spread across me.A warmth mostly unrelated to the bottle of whisky I'd unwrapped that morning.I smiled and clicked the link.Perhaps they'd never know how much their post had meant.Yet on today of all days, they'd taken the time to spread a little bit of Christmas joy to countless strangers.I couldn't do much to repay them.I'd no special talents or skills.So I decided to type a reply:

*"Thank you.You too."*
