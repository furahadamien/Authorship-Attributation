"The Surgeon General would like to remind you that smoking causes lung cancer and other serious health effects"

Will squinted at the bright neon billboard, its screen casting an unnatural white glow over an otherwise dimly lit street.Taking in the message before briefly sighing and continuing his walk, he gradually made his way down to the corner store, trading the dim glow for bright florescent lights.The man behind the counter smiled warmly:

"Evening Will, the usual?""Yep"

From behind the counter, the man produced a long unmarked white box, the front of which had only a single line of text "Smoking causes cancer".They'd stopped printing brands on the boxes a long time ago.Will took the box from the man.He walked outside, opened the box and removed a pack, taking a moment to inspect the rather generic item.Once more he found only a single line of text: 

"God Dammit Will"

"Fuck"
