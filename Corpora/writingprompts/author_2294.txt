"Hello!Can you hear me?I thought you are never going to wake up."My vision was still a little hazy.I tried clearing my eyes.The kid had pigtails."Are you feeling better?Do you want something to drink?"Ummmm "Where am I?"I thought a better question than who are you.Also, I didn't remember getting here."It's my castle."The girl announced proudly."Papa built it for me.He said a princess like me should have a big castle"

"It's beautiful."I tried to be nice.Still needed to figure out where I am.How did I got here."Thank you.Come join my tea party.You look like you could use some tea."She said with a sage expression."Mama gives tea to Aunt Marie when she cries.""I'm not crying.But tea sounds nice."I went on to the little table and chair set.

"I'm Ayan, by the way.And this is Baby, Mr Brown and Tigga."" My name is Sarah."I joined the girl and her toys.The knock on the door surprised me.I was having fun with the kid.It's been awhile since I've had some fun."Hey baby, is your party over?are you going to come back in the house?"The woman completely ignored me.I felt frozen."But we are having so much fun.Can I stay a few more minutes?""Okay.but come soon, alright?""She can't see you."Ayan whispered to me.I look at the girl in complete surprise."No one can.You are my friend."That happened a month ago.I've been hanging out with Ayan since.She is right, no one could see me.And as far as afterlife goes, it's not that bad.You randomly get assigned to a kid to be their guide as an imaginary friend.I've met with a few more like me in other tea parties.It's a sweet gig.Like a bonus stage in a game.Better than being stuck in the limbo.We'll move on when the kids grow up.I'm gonna miss the little girl.But for now, I'm going to enjoy the pretend tea and cookies, the story times, the songs and rhymes, the innocence of it all.
