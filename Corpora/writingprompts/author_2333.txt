It's called quantum immortality.I can't explain it to you - no literally the explanation if given will change the reality of the situation.But... Let's just say that within a certain radius observers have an effect on events.This is the general twenty-first century explanation.Even your expectations of an event can change it.Even retroactively.An expectation, fear, hope, after the fact can actually effect the outcome that proceeded it.Now the radius is quite large.Something like seventeen light years and change.of course people argue that is a relative limit we imposed on ourselves because we started experimenting at the rogue planet seventeen light years and change away from earth.They're probably right, but you shouldn't think about it.Again, not because it will waste time or anything but because thinking on it may effect things.That is unless you are in a densely enough populated space, say at least four or five observers within ten light years.The more fundamental the thing the fewer observers needed to keep it locked into reality.Changing PI may be fundamentally impossible because our existence depends on the physical constant all the from the big bang until now.As does the existence of all future observers and all observers in the same time frame but so far away we know nothing of them.But small things like gravity.Fuck.That was the first thing we noticed.The spinning rings of the torrid-station orbiting the rogue planet had begun to slow.No one noticed because the "gravity" in the ring was the same.As an experiment two of the scientist as a prank, slowed the rotation more and more until the ring was almost stopped.Still, a gravity like effect.Even they, the two in the know, felt the effect because of the other observers.Like Santa Clause, Zeus, or Jesus, it was easy to convince the growing batch of children that this was how it was "meant" to be.Slowly it was explained to the other scientists those locked into their own experiments on the planet.One by one they were brought up and shown.There was only one wobble.It's easiest to explain that as an unmaking of the universe.One of the physicists Knew, that's KNEW, it could not happen.Even with everyone else observing it reality shifted.There was a quick conversation between the three physicists and suddenly reality was cool with observed effects, and the Theory of Observed Effects came to be.Of all the things that changed, ethics was the one that changed the most.I was raised without the need to food or drink.I mean I ate.I drank.But it was like... well masturbation.Something fun to do but not important biologically.I didn't need it to survive.Everyone died.I can't really say how, I'm not sure.More over thinking about it, while being the only observer in local space could be dangerous.For a long time I was fine.The gardens still grew, most of the bugs were healthy in their cycles and their protein was tasty.I spent most of my time trying not to wonder if this wasn't how the universe started.If there was not a god, or if I was not God - Capital G.

I kept my self locked in a small closet for those thoughts.And to dream.I can't tell you the number of people who popped into existence, or the plants and systems that came to be simply from my boredom and imagination.We had a standard AI core.It took me 857 years to get to the phrase, "100% of people who drink water will die."I'm not even sure where I heard it.But it changed something in me.I had stopped drinking and eating myself a long time past.I grew thirsty.More importantly I feared I changed the way the universe would work.As if I drank something I'd either die outright or the rules of reality would "go back to normal."the more I thought about it the more I worried, the more I worried the more I observed.I could feel the universe around me like a multidimensional blanket.And suddenly I knew.There was a way out.I stand here now on a dead station, distress call racing away through space at the snails pace of light, glass of water in my hand.I know when I drink it this dream will be over.A dream born of madness from oxygen depervation, lack of food and water, and the deaths of my friends, parents, and coworkers.I don't have powers, or immortality, or a deeper understanding of the malleability of the universe.I have but two things.A deep, thorough hope that my distress call will be responded to, and a thirst I can't every hope to quench.I don't know how long I've been standing there when the proximity sensors sound, but I drink the water down quickly in two big gulps.Which is odd because I'm floating, my ears pounding with my heartbeat, my lungs laboring for meaningful air.The question of how I could drink from a glass dissolves into more immediate concerns of survival.Air, heat, food, water."This is the Jump-Tug Orion responding to an emergency FTL beacon.If there are survivors prepare to be boarded."
