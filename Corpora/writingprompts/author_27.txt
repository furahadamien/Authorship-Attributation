Bob says, "It's ok little Adolf, you just need some help.Grab your brush and get ready, ok?"Hitler, shocked by this kind mans generosity, complies, and sets up his easel and canvas, preps his oils, and grabs his brush."We're going to start off with a simple fence here.Nice and tall, but not too tall.And lets give it some wire at the top.Kill the jews.Theeeere we go.Now, let's add a pretty building behind the fence.Just like that.Lets go ahead and give him a friend.Lets give his friend a nice tall chimney.Perfect.Kill the jews.Now, lets go ahead and paint some nice men here with pointy hats guarding this place.You know what, on second thought, let's get rid of the pointy hats.Great."By the time Bob had gotten to this point, Hitler was a little freaked out, and Bob could sense it."What's wrong friend?", Bob said."I..I...I just don't know why we're painting this.", Hitler replied."It's going to help liberate the people of your country of course.", Bob stated, but a loud horse neighed outside of the window as it pulled a buggy past, which had not yet been replaced by Henry Ford's model T in Germany."What was that?", Hitler asked

"Oh nothing", Bob replied, "But Im afraid I'm going to have to cut out meeting short."As he said this, he drew uncomfortably close to Adolf

"Sir, What are you doing?"Bob slowly raised his brush to Hitler's eye level, and then slowly higher as he got within a hairs breath from hitler's ear."Never forget me", Bob said, as he licked Hitler's ear and lightly dabbed his brush on the young artist's forehead.Then, with a soft *poof*, the strange man with the big hair vanished.Yet the paint and wetness on his ear remained.Two weeks later, he checked himself in to counseling, where he talked through his dilemmas with his counselor.During this time, the counselor used his art as a tool to help him.6 months later, when he finished his course, he spent an entire week painting a wonderful rendition of a field several miles out of chrzanow, Poland.This painting sold overseas for 2,000,000, funding his young art career.
