"Turn around...Please."I stumble forward, desperate to escape my insanity.The pills were working.They were working.Their not working."Please!Stop!"The desperation in her voice halts me.I know that feeling.I know what its like to be desperate.A clawing, yearning, all consuming desperation.Desperate for anyone to listen to me."Please Nina... you're.not.real.Ok?"I continue forward.Desperate.Like her voice.Like me, as always."Michael; i know what they've told you.I know what you've been through.I'm sorry i shut down our bond.I'm sorry!Ok?! "I stop midstep.The flow of pedestrians to either side of me reminds me of a rock in a river.I close my eyes and point my face up.I take a couple steadying breaths; than i turn.And all the breath leaves my lungs.She's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen."Oh Michael... you.. you're..." she sprints the 20 or so feet between us and jumps into my arms.I cath her and hold her to me.Nothing has ever felt so right."You're really real?"I whisper into her hair.Breathing in her scent.Feeling like my heart is a 1000 times lighter, and heavier, all at once."Im really real.I've missed you so much."I freeze at this.She's been real this whole time.She's real... and she abandoned me.Left me to suffer the hospitalizations; the eltro shock.My whole family has been afraid me.Even in my darkest of days her voice was my haven.But one day it just stoped.2 years.Its been 2 fucking years.I push her away.Wiping angrily at my face."What do you want?"She recoils as if id struck her."You."I close my eyes again and hate myself for loving that one simple statement."No.""Mikey, wai.." she's saying as i turn around and continue walking."Mikey they're here!"I swing back around in time to notice several large men running towards us.I make eye contact with the front man.Than i see it.Everything she's seen, and i know everything she knows.I look at her and she nods.We grab hands and we run.
