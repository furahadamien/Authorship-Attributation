**The Family...**

The Family is a secretive group the works with assassins to influence the world.They're a secret program developed by a company, though I don't know which.From what we were taught, it was originally developed to be a private assassination squad that would target key figures from the company's rivals.As time continued on and the world changed, the group expanded its scope of operations.They stopped training their own assassination squads and began blackmailing preexisting assassins...The program has changed since that was implemented but not by much...

How they pick their candidates is unknown, me and my buddy were veterans they picked up.We had done some... less than morally correct things during our service.When The Family approached us, we didn't have much of a choice due to the blackmailing.The job pays good, which is nice, but there's certain drawbacks - as with every job.There's a ranking list, over 300 operatives across the globe and all of them in competition with each other.While the murder of fellow operatives is strictly forbidden, the sabotage of missions for others is not.If you get too low on the ranking board, lose your rank, you're *tied* up.No need to support inadequate members in service...

Those lower on the ranking list are sent to Japan for their missions.Lots of people there, lots of escape routes too - the perfect hunting ground of the inexperienced.Unfortunately, when you perform better you get shipped out to other posts in various countries.At least, that's how it use to be until The Family began expanding again.Rather than having independent branches in various territories to blend in, it's began interlinking them - combining them.The problem this poses for people like me and others ranked lower on the listings, the more interconnected they are - they less there is a need for operatives in every section.Fewer operative means more heads will role and I and few others might end up on the chopping block...I need to leave, I can't keep my contacts waiting...
