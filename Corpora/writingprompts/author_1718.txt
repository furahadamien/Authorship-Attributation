I decided to describe the *other* worlds, and how I think they're like.* **Earth:** With the very rock we stand on as we know it gone, life is basically in space, and uses magical gravity-changing spells to keep everything together (remember, they have magic at their disposal.)Controlled projection or hallucination spells are made to give the illusion of a solid object, even though it's just that, and only bound by gravitation spells.Zero-gravity is considered the ultimate hazard; it could be the easiest way to be lost forever.* **Water:** Without a basic all-in-one liquid, the oceans are instead a cesspool of liquids, and various parts have different liquids.Natural, yet still unorthodox liquids such as milk compromise the ocean, rain, and plants even evolve to specifically be lactose tolerant, as well as tolerant to other liquids.Soda oceans result from carbonation of some oceans, normally with disastrous results, though plenty of people find the resulting water delicious... if purified, that is.If you go to the equator, you may just see the rare LAVA ocean.Use your fortified boats and heat-proof gear, though, for when you go through them.* **Air:** With no air to breathe, humanity and life as we know it has evolved to use gills, and use the water as their source of oxygen.The furthest it's gotten is amphibians, which is what humans are in this sort of life, but they do all eventually need to retreat to water.Given the risks of air, a lot of people choose to live underwater, or at the very least in marshy areas.Waterproof technology isn't optional; it's *mandatory* for most.* **Fire:** With nothing else to "heat", electricity seems the best step, as it gives similar sensations.In this world, electronics developed far quicker, the industry developed almost instantaneously, and the world is very sci-fi.* **Magic:** ...Um, Hi?You're already here.
