We have abducted Matt Damon, send us all your uranium or watch him die. The small, green aliens smiled to themselves and sat back to wait for the answer.Uh, thats Mark Wahlberg, said the Earth representative.You can keep him.

What?What do you mean?The alien turned in its chair.Jerry, we said Matt Damon.We cant negotiate if we dont have Damon! The alien turned back to the Earth representative.Fine, take him.Can we get a boxed set of Ted 1 and 2?

Um, thats also Mark Wahlberg.

FUCK!Get out of here! The alien was fuming.A few minutes later, having boarded their ship to return to Earth, the representative turned to the other man.Did they hurt you, Mr. Damon?No, Im alright.They kept playing Good Vibrations by Marky Mark, though.Lets go grab a Wahlberger.
