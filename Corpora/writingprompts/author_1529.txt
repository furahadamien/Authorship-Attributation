Jacob was suddenly jolted awake.He was so frightened that he fell off the couch he laid on.He realized that something was in the room with him.Could it be Santa?It was technically Christmas since it was so late into the night.Rather than be fearful, there was a sudden excitement that overwhelmed Jacob as he approached the fireplace.More excitement filled Jacob the second he realized that it actually was Santa!Santa was crouched down, trying to go back up through the chimney.Jacob was shaking with excitement."Santa!"Jacob nearly screamed in joy.Santa jolted back, hitting his head hard on the top of the fireplace, "Shit!Stupid little shi- I mean!Ho ho ho!"he said.Jacob jumped up and down in joy, creaking the wood beneath him.It was actually Santa in the flesh!How could this be possible?He thought that he was the luckiest kid in the world!Santa began shushing Jacob, "Shhh!Not too loud you idiot!"he hissed, "I mean... Kiddo!Ho ho ho!"Jacob frowned, but his face quickly returned to a smile.He looked over at the table that had milk and cookies on it."Are you going to eat the cookies mother baked for you?"Jacob asked tilting his head.Santa sighed, "No those are butterscotch cookies, they're gro- I mean... Of course, I will!Ho ho ho!"Santa slowly tiptoed over to the cookies, sitting down, then began slowly eating them.As he ate the cookies, tears rolled down his face.Suddenly, Santa started to sob loudly.Jacob wandered over to Santa, grabbing his knee."What's wrong Santa?Why are you crying?"Jacob asked.As Jacob got closer, he noticed that there was an earpiece in Santa's right ear.Also, Jacob was able to hear a small voice.The voice seemed to come from the earpiece.Santa wiped the tears away from his face, then he suddenly grabbed Jacob by the shoulders, pulling him close to his face."Listen!"Santa hissed, "I don't have much time!My name isn't Santa!It's Phillip Davis!I'm a scientist!Many years ago I went to the North Pole on an expedition!Then I get captured by these... Theses things!They're forcing me to give presents every Christmas!Santa is not what you think it means!It actually means-"

Santa was interrupted as a dart struck him in the neck.He collapsed to the ground unconscious.Out of the darkness, a small figure appeared.The figure had pale white skin and pointed ears.He wore an all-black suit, sunglasses, and a headset with a mic.In his hands was a rifle, most likely the one used to shot Santa with the dart.He walked towards Santa, glanced over at Jacob, then grabbed Santa by the foot."You saw nothing kid... You understand me?Nothing."The figure said coldly as he dragged Santa across the floor, then up the chimney.Jacob was completely and utterly shocked.He grabbed the plate of cookies, wandered over to the trash, and dumped the entire plate inside."Ok then..." Jacob said, "No more butterscotch cookies..."
