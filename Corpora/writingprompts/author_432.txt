FHRegulus
The line was open for less than 60 seconds.It carried none of the fanfare we expected from them."We're good.Best of luck to the rest of you."It was casual and, with a bit of personal input, a bit flippant.I suppose they had always been like that.Their borders never opened again.They stayed shut long after the 50 year window.By year 60 the UN agreed they had to know.The drones developed in India were unparalleled.Undetectable.The first spot it went had recovered.DC was far from the crater we expected.Modest buildings, homes clustered together, and smiling people.The city shouldn't have been habitable.LA, New York, Chicago, and Houston were the same.They were fine.Their skylines hadn't returned but people and structures had.Rumors and theories dominated the commentary of the next few months.It ranged from wild theories of aliens to the modest belief that "Americans did always value their independence."After the complete satellite mapping was done, we learned some truths.No skyscrapers.No true cities we had come to expect.However, we saw no homeless, no hungry, but no mansions either.No megahomes.The buildings were far from identical but they were all, to the last, modest.Their technology was fairly unremarkable, nothing like the rest of the world.Their bionics seemed advanced, sure, but what fascinated me as a child was their farming tech.That was the only place they were leaps and bounds ahead of ours.Even now, 30 years past the deadline, they haven't reopened the gates.As a child I watched the videos of the country in awe.How had they done it?I can't help but look at the buildings of the megacorps in my city and wonder: who paid the first official to suggest the plan in the first place?
