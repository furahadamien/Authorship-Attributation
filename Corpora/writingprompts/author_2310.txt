"What?"I woke up from a bright light and saw pink paint.It reminded me of my room when I was little girl.There were shelves of stuffed animals... even a stuffed Pikachu.The room had a television with some game console.There was also surprisingly, a bunk bed that looked like mine.Everything was a little too reminiscent.Except for this little girl in a princess dress standing in front of me.She was kind of cute.I suddenly missed my kids."Hey!"Said the little girl, "I said 'Come play tea party.'""Oh, right!"I told her.Might as well indulge until I figure out how to get home.She walked by her table though and pointed up at the Pikachu doll."What?You want Pikachu to have some tea?"I asked her with a smile.The little girl smiled and nodded her head.I reached for the stuffed toy and got it down for her.I've never seen a kid so happy.Well, that's a lie.But she was happy.She set up the table again and said, "Sit."I pulled out one of her little chairs and sat on it.But it made me a little uncomfortable so I set it to the side and knelt at the table instead.The little girl looked at me curiously."What's wrong?"She asked me."The chair is really tiny.I don't want to break it so I'll just sit like this.Is that okay?"I asked her.She shrugged and just poured the tea... *Wait.There's real tea coming out of this.THE TEA IS REAL!*

"What is this?"I asked her."Tea.Taste it!"She said so matter-of-factly that I laughed.I took a sip and it was cold.The girl had given me some cold Arizona iced tea.Her parents were probably going to be so pissed that their daughter was wasting the tea.There was something not quite right about this place though.Why did it look like my memories had been infiltrated and put on display?Who was this kid?"What's your name?"I asked her."Akari."She said."Aw, really?I have a daughter named Akari!"I told her.She smiled.I took some more sips of my tea.My eyes were looking for the can or jug she had gotten this stuff from.I needed more than just a few kiddie sized tea cups."Where's your Mommy and Daddy, Akari?"I asked her."Daddy is downstairs with my brother.Mommy died three years ago."She said.She also sipped some tea.She seemed to be really composed about the loss.I didn't really get how some kids could be like that."What's your brother's name?""Lucas."I almost dropped my cup.My son's name is Lucas."Hey, can I go use the potty?"I asked like an idiot.Surely the girl knows what a bathroom is called.Before she could finish answering, I got up and walked into the hallway.I went downstairs and ran into a tall dark man in the kitchen.He was strong and handsome.He had dark skin and large brown eyes that would make a woman swoon when the sun hit them just right.He was my husband.That girl upstairs *was* my daughter.And I have been dead for three whole years.
