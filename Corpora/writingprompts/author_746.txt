Fyrebarde
The Gardener walked slowly though the Garden, tending the little ones as needed.A spritz of goofiness here, a sense of daring here, and a dash of smarts here.Towards the center of the Garden, he perked up, anticipation giving speed to his movements.Was that a toe bean he saw pushing out of its nest of warm blankets?Ah, it was today, and he'd almost forgotten the best good little boy was on his way, eager to go forth and meet Friends and Name Givers and get pets and play fetch and protect his people from the Squirrels.A few little yips and yelps, a wet nose to the ear, one overdue First Belly Rub, and the best good little boy trotted out of the Garden, tail wagging wildly, towards the Big Adventure.
