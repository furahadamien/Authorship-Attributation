My anger finally had an outlet.He did nothing more than pick up a banknote that I'd dropped.$10 was a drop in the ocean.But my mind had been roiling for months, like a storm-tossed sea of rage.And money was the cause.Sure, I had enough to be comfortable; more than enough.But the whole concept of ownership bothered me on a profound level.Property, stocks, national currencies, they all seemed like the rash justifications of people trying to snatch things for themselves.So, I followed the unlucky bystander of my disquieted mind.He turned right into an alley, I pursued, blinkered by hatred.By the ineptitude of the human race.I was willing to throw away everything I had; my friends, family, relationships.No gesture other than violence seemed to have any impact.He stopped before the end of the alley and turned to face me.He had a confused expression on his face and in one hand he held a cane."Silly me, I've taken the wrong turn."He said, embarrassed.I noticed his glasses were dark as well, too dark to see in the dimly lit alley: he was blind."How did you pick up my $10 bill if you can't see?"I asked, my hear still simmering."Oh!That was yours?I'm so sorry.I heard something rustling on the ground so I bent to pick it up."He replied apologetically.I guided him out of the alley and refused to accept my $10 bill back."Where are you heading?"I asked with something resembling calm."I'm speaking at a conference on the Universal Basic Income.We've been running a test of the system in Norway, the results could change the world economy forever."He said, barely containing his excitement.The sea was still.My heart slowed.The haze over my mind lifted.My hope finally had an outlet.
