Sure Captain Honor admitted the young heroes caught more criminals in quantity, but Captain Honor was adamant about beating them in quality.He caught more real super villains than anyone else.The real big names like DoubleShot, BadBaller, KingCruel were caught by none other than Captain Honor himself.And he did it with just his tried and true powers of enhanced strength and agility without the need for fancy new technology.Although, for some reason the criminals he caught seemed to be able to escape prison whenever they wanted.But one day the scariest most violent villain of them all, Sin, kidnapped the mayor of the city and after executing several prominent businessmen and politicians.Sin demanded chemicals and equipment which seemed to obviously be for weapons by the end of the day.The heroes guild only managed to recruit 3 super heroes in time to make a rescue attempt before Sin's ransom timer was up.Though the honorable captain was ready they didn't recruit him for the cause.Dishonored, the captain decided to force his way into the group."Why didn't you guys call me for help?"he asked them.The 3 other heroes grew awkwardly silent until their leader, HellMan responded "we didn't want to disturb your retirement" to which Honor replied "I'm not retired.I'll never retire."Hellman's patience ran out, though to be fair he was half demon and didn't have much to start with, and he said "Look old man, you're just going to get in the way".The Captain looked to the other two heroes and asked "WaterGirl, SteelHawk, do you really agree with this guy?"They looked away from him too bashful to say anything, but in obvious agreement with HellMan."I remember when these guys were just a bunch of kids trying to fit-in with the normals in school" thought Honor."I'm coming whether you're greatfull for it or not" said Captain Honor.The plan was ready, SteelHawk with his powersuit that gave him flight and advanced weaponry was going to surprise and distract them from above.WaterGirl was going to sneak by turning into water.After WaterGirl found the Mayor, HellMan was going to teleport to her and teleport the hostage out leaving WaterGirl and SteelHawk to escape on their own as HellMan could only teleport one other person per day.WaterGirl was immune to bullets and physical attacks as she was made of water, and SteelHawk was extremely agile in his flight suit so escaping without HellMan's help would be the easy part.Captain Honor, not included in their plan at all, decided he was going to fight his way to Sin and take the guy out directly.The operation began with SteelHawk shooting rockets from very high in the air.WaterGirl sneaked in through the plumbing system until she made her way to the room with the Mayor.The plan was going well, they didn't fire any anti-air shots at SteelHawk and the room with the Mayor seemed unguarded.Meanwhile, Captain Honor sneaked his way in, beating up some dumb guards on the way.WaterGirl ran up to the Mayor and freed him.He started to laugh.The Mayor ripped at his own hair.His head hair and beard came off, and underneath was the bald and clean shaven face of Sin himself.WaterGirl wished she had payed more attention to local politics so she could have recognized he wasn't the Mayor.Sin's laughing continued as he hit a button on a panel on his arm and the entire room burst out in electric shocks.WaterGirl screamed, as electricity was her weakness.She quickly lost consciousness.Sin on the other hand seemed to enjoy the pain from the electric shocks, as he was a bit of a masochist.Sin put his hand inside WaterGirl's liquid head and his hand started to heat up.It was so hot the room lit up in unbearable brightness.When the light dissipated WaterGirl's head was no more, and her body turned into regular lifeless water."WATERGIRL?WATERGIRL ARE YOU THERE?WATERGIRLLLL" screamed HellMan unaware of her demise.Through the rashness of his youth he decided to teleport to her last location, unaware of it's disposition.He teleported to the location, but the room seemed empty other than a peculiar puddle of water next to an unoccupied chair in the center.HellMan's eyed the puddled and assumed the worse, which made him unbearably angry."SteelHawk, come in through the window at my location!"he screamed into their communication's line."What?Why?"asked SteelHawk "WaterGirl's.... down" replied HellMan.HellMan charged up a fireball, as he prepared for battle.SteelHawk burst in through the window only to find a thoroughly destroyed room with burnt grunts about.He dashed through the halls looking for his companion.Just more burnt thugs, although he noticed a strange human-shaped imprint charred onto the wall.He payed it no mind and ran along.Only a few rooms later he started running into active guards.He shot them down with no mercy.He took a few shots himself in the process, but his suit blocked them easily.Eventually he ran into a room with just Sin standing in wait.Sin shot him with a strange looking gun, but the bullet didn't go through his suit either."Where's HellMan" screamed SteelHawk."He's dead.Didn't you see his cremation a few rooms back?"replied Sin.Tears began to drip down SteelHawk's face, he was glad his helmet prevented Sin from seeing them.Sin started to laugh "I can tell you're crying under that helmet boy".SteelHawk started to get scared.He always thought HellMan and WaterGirl were unkillable.He decided he was probably walking into some kind of trap and flew out the nearest window.SteelHawk flew extremely high and finally got control of his panic."Ca- Captain Honor are you there?"he asked."Yes I'm here SteelHawk" readily replied The Captain."I don't know what to do Captain, I think...I think WaterGirl and HellMan are... dead..." Captain Honor felt horrible on the inside, but knew now was not the time for weakness.So he said "Don't worry SteelHawk, I'll deal with this".Just as he heard the message SteelHawk started to fall.He spent the seconds he had while falling to fiddle with his suit and didn't have the time to message Captain Honor.SteelHawk found the problem, it seems whatever Sin shot him with was lodged in his suit, activated, and was now shutting down his flight capabilities.SteelHawk managed to pry the invading device from his suit, but just as his suit started up again he crashed into the concrete.Captain Honor heard a loud crash outside, and asked SteelHawk what was going on.There was no reply.He ran into a few more guards but they all ran away from him."Wow looks like these thugs finally learned to not mess with Captain Honor" he said to himself.Eventually he reached Sin.Sin let out a gasp of very dramatic surprise."How did you make it here!"Sin yelled."Hah, your pathetic guards ran away from me.I guess you should up their pay huh?"joked Captain Honor."I guess loyalty is more expensive than I thought now adays" replied Sin with a smirk.Captain Honor chuckled and then got into fighting stance.Sin did the same and they started exchanging blows with there fists.It went back and forth.They seemed evenly matched in kick boxing techniques, though both seemed to be tiring.Captain Honor then threw a wild hay-maker, Sin saw it coming from a mile away and dodged preemptively.But the punch was a  trick and turned into a grab.Captain Honor held Sin's collar and perfectly performed a hipthrow slamming Sin onto the ground.Captain Honor then stuck his knee onto Sin's chest and proclaimed victory as he said "It's over Sin, I got you"."Oh darn, you got me again Captain Honor!"yelled Sin."What have you done with my comrades Sin?"asked Honor.Sin looked around awkwardly not sure what to say."OUT WITH IT SCUM!"yelled The Captain.Sin sighed and said "Do you really want to know?", "OF COURSE I DO TELL ME NOW!".Sin got a very somber and serious look on his face and said "They're dead".Captain Honor was shocked, he was so sure SteelHawk was just exaggerating and panicking like an amateur when he said they were dead earlier."That's impossible, how could a lowly villain like you defeat them?"asked Captain Honor."I don't want to tell you" said Sin."What why not?"asked The Captain."Cause you were always my favorite hero going up..." Honor almost blushed at the genuine heart to heart compliment, but eventually regained his composure to ask "But, what's that got to do with anything?"Sin kept saying he didn't want to tell Captain Honor, but Honor kept asking getting more and more angry.Sin even started to say he would give up the hostage and leave if Honor just dropped the questions.But Honor was far too angry for that and instead started slapping and eventually punching Sin in the face until Sin finally started getting mad himself.His eyes watery Sin told Honor the truth."Look, most of us villains were just normal kids growing up.And... like normal kids we all had our heroes.And me, like a lot of my associates really looked up to you Captain Honor.The world has become a fucked up place sir, but you and the few old heroes who are left somehow stayed above all that.So we've sort of... been going easy on you"."Easy on me?I don't believe you!"replied Captain Honor.A forcefield suddenly appeared around Sin, and expanded out pushing Captain Honor back.Honor tried punching the force field, but did nothing but hurt his own hand."Why... why if you really look up to me did you do all this!?"yelled Captain Honor."Honestly, I don't think you could understand me without becoming a villain yourself.I don't want to ever see that happen".Sin activated his jet-boots and blasted out of the room.His group scattered, but not before executing the Mayor.After having a similar conversation with other villains, Captain Honor decided to retire.For More Stories:
