"Musk" Bond spat."Well fancy seeing you here all dressed up for the occasion" smirked Elon in reply, "You were getting uncomfortably close to the truth you know.You're right about the the solar cells, but I don't think you quite comprehend the genius of the boring company".James took a quick glance around the sterile room.Five white suited assistants stood several meters away, flamethrowers levelled at him, while further back a hive of workers quietly rushed around.Bond shook his head as he surreptitiously inched his hand towards the seatbelt release."You know you won't get away with this; MI6 know what you're up to.""Famous last words Mr Bond!But I know in this case you're wrong: that coded message you sent back to the Queen?Turns out that's my satellite it was supposed to be bouncing off."Bond slammed his hand on the seatbelt release and leapt towards Elon, only for the suit to promptly stop him halfway."James, James, James", Musk explained, "I'm disappointed!I'm an A-class villain, not one of your usual B-grade menagerie.You simply won't get out of this, your suit is literally part of the seat cushion".Musk leaned over the door and opened the glove box with a flourish."No fancy gadgets here to help I'm afraid: we took your flamethrower - nice design by the way, I think I might commercialize it - although you can have this towel... maybe it will keep you warm up there?"Bond grunted in effort as he twisted his head to look at Elon

"Not going to crush the car with me in it?To conventional?Not enough R&D involved?"James baited, frantically trying to devise an escape plan."Oh no, you're much more special than that.You're going to be in the greatest show on earth... or off earth".A small chuckle.Bond stared back blankly as he tested the car pedals in the desperate hope they would do something."You're going to be strapped onto three leaky pipe bombs and sent to Mars!"Musk concluded with a sideways grin.*****

"Four... Three... Two... One... and lift-off of the Falcon Heavy" announced a voice in the dark, the muffled cheers merging into the background roar of the engines far below.James was familiar with rocket launches, and as far as they went this was actually quite gentle.Even so, he knew there was no time to waste if he was to stop Elon's dastardly plan.Despite being pitch black inside the payload bay he easily found an angle where the suit seemed to strain, and using his arm as a lever was rewarded with the pops of seam stitches breaking at his shoulder."Beginning pitchover", the bodiless voice continued.James was flung forwards as the rocket suddenly pitched, and the whole sleeve of the suit sheared off with a rip."How very handy" James muttered as he tossed the arm and glove away.The darkness was broken by the smug visage of Elon appearing on the car screen."You know it was 50/50 as to whether you'd be barbecued by now so I'd say you're doing pretty well all things considered"

James ignored him and instead worked on unzipping the three layered suit and sliding out.He gave it a fond pat on the helmet as he reached over into the glove box."I'm sorry though, you're just not suitable".Grabbing the towel he opened the car door and stepped carefully onto the payload adapter, feet feeling the way in the darkness."Stage one propulsion is nominal"

The vibrations were reaching their crescendo as Bond quickly reached back into the car and turned the headlights on, flooding the fairing with light."Very clever, but don't bother trying the handbrake, you'll find it doesn't work!"Elon's cheery voice was noticeably quieter as the air continued to rush out of the vents into the vacuum outside.It was getting hard to breathe as James slid down the conical mount onto the compartment floor.He looked around despondently at the blank walls as the atmosphere got thinner."Max Q"

James cursed."Of course!Q!"he took his socks off and placed one on each of the fairing locks, before spitting on each and retreating.The special edition thermite socks burst into flames where his saliva had hit, melting through the mechanism holding the fairing halves together.The air pressured plummeted as the fairing went spinning back towards the earth, revealing the pure black of the sky and the deep blue of the ocean far below.The acceleration was becoming difficult as Bond tied the towel to the hinge hook and lowered himself down onto the top of a side booster, nearly blacking out from the effort and lack of oxygen.His lungs struggled to draw air in as he flopped on the top of the nosecone."Time... to.. stop.. worrying.. and.. learn.. to... love.."...

James woke to a warm foot and a singeing smell.He tried to move his leg away from the edge but an invisible giant was pinning it, along with the rest of him, firmly in place against the shuddering nosecone.The force abruptly stopped and was replaced with a loud hiss and... stillness?Bond slowly wormed his way to the peak and looked around.Sure enough, he was back on planet earth.Unfortunately 200ft above it, and with a convoy of SpaceX vehicles kicking up a trail of dust as they bounced towards him.He stomped on the nose, trying to break through the carbon fibre shell.He'd only managed to make a small dent by the time the army of Teslas arrived, spilling out dozens of young engineers and a few menacing security guards armed with flamethrowers.Finally a brand new midnight cherry Roadster came screaming up to the base of the rocket and Musk furiously leapt over the door.He grabbed a bullhorn and started shouting."You just stay right there Bond!Don't try anything smart.Some fool engineer must have loaded you into the wrong core, yes, that has to be it."His ranting was soon drowned out by the sound of an approaching helicopter.It buzzed around Bond a few times before slowly advancing."Need a lift?""Felix, you old dog!I don't want to impose.", Bond replied

"Just get in Bond.So who is that anyway?"They paused to listen to Musk:

"If you don't come down right this instant I'll open fire!""It's a long story Felix, longer than we have if we don't get moving soon".Bond waved cheerily at Musk as he finished climbing in; "time to go and expose you"

"No!Open fire" shouted Musk, aiming at the helicopter but only spraying the base of the rocket.Fire slowly licked up the side as the helicopter ascended, before one of the legs gave a groan and gave out.Elon rushed over and tried to brace the still burning core but ever so slowly the whole tube tipped over and exploded in a painful flash of light and heat."I guess that must have been a bit too *heavy* for him"
