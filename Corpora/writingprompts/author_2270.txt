Put em up, boys.

I could hardly believe where the voice was coming from.A boy, maybe thirteen years old at the latest, leveled a gun at my chest.He wore a cocky grin that radiated confidence and maybe something more.Something that wasnt quite right.Worse, he had friends.Maybe ten other kids stood behind him.They all looked tough and battle hardened, covered in the scars and muscles of much older men.More out of place was the little girl standing in a white cotton nightgown behind the leader, tugging on his shirt.Do we have to do it this way, Peter? I heard her whisper.Her eyes were wide, huge like shining white pearls.Come on, Wendy, its the only way, he said, and his grin grew unsettlingly wide.Come on, itll be fun.Itll be like were playing Soldiers and Pirates.

For the last few seconds, I had been standing in quiet shock.The nerve of this kid!To attack a police officer right inside of the precinct!I almost wanted to laugh out loud.I looked behind me, and sure enough, my guys were all armed and ready to take this suicidal delinquent into custody.Put that thing down, kid, I said, almost lazily.There was nothing to be afraid of, not with twenty armed officers behind me.You wont be using it anytime soon.

Oh, its not for me, the leader, whose name I figured was Peter, answered.He turned to the girl next to him.Are you ready? he asked her.Trembling, she nodded.Now, just wait a second, the officer next to me said.I know that girl.Shes Georges daughter. His eyes were shining with fear; not for himself, I somehow knew, but for the girl in front of him.He knelt down in front of her at eye level, his face open and accepting.Come on, miss, give me the gun, he pleaded softly.Before you do something you regret.

It happened so fast.There was a bang like a thousand balloons being popped and the officer sunk forward on bended knees as if praising the one who had brought about his death.The girl let out a gasping sob; her eyes filled with tears.Behind her the boys slowly began to clap, bringing their hands together faster and faster until the room was filled with its crescendo.I unfroze from my fear and drew my gun.GET DOWN! I screamed, my body thrumming with warning.ALL OF YOU, GET DOWN ON THE GROUND NOW!

Oh, I dont think so, Peter said again, his smirk still solidly in place.If anything, it had grown.Congratulations, Wendy.Youll be the first to get the Dust tomorrow. Her face brightened and she beamed with the kind of joy a child has at Christmas.As for the rest of you, Peter continued, casually taking the gun, The shows over.And you might want to duck.

I slammed my body onto the floor, not a second too soon.Gunshots rang through the air.The sound was incredible, slamming into my ears from all sides.Below it all were the screams and the meaty *thwack* of bullets hitting flesh.*I need to get help*, I thought.My mind cleared and I saw my phone sitting tantalizingly out of reach, mere feet away from my outstretched grasp.Five feet into open fire.I didnt want to lose a hand, but now it seemed as if I didnt have a choice.Gathering all my strength and praying to whatever God exists in this miserable fucked up world where children could kill, I sprung to my feet.And promptly slammed right into one of Peters goons.There was a silence ten times more terrifying than the gunfire.I swung around, and there was Peter, his jaunty smile unchanged.His clothes were covered in blood and gore.My hands searched my holster, only to find it empty.A million thoughts raced through my head, each one wild and desperate from the last.Tell me, Peter began, cocking the gun under his chin in a gesture reminiscent of *The Thinker.* Are you Captain Hook?

That he is, boss, said a voice from the opposite side of the room.I looked up and was surprised to see one of my boys in blue sauntering up the kid, all smiles and meekness.I did what you asked.Will you take me to Tink now?

Peter struck him across the face with a sound like crisp gunfire.Immediately his face turned into that of a demons, brimming with a hatred boy his age should never have had.You will not speak unless spoken to, he hissed.Then, his face abruptly shifted back into its cocky grin.I want to hear it from him.

You wont hear anything from me, I snarled, and leapt again.This time, my legs took me exactly where I wanted to go.Peter was so shocked that he didnt have time to react; I slammed into him and forced him onto the ground, taking the gun and backing away immediately.Yes, that was stupid, and I should have shot him right there.But I didnt want to spend one more second on top of that murderer.Peter recovered surprisingly fast.I saw the fires of hell in his eyes, but I kept the gun steady.Whos Tink? I asked, figuring I had nothing more to lose.Peter stepped closer to the gun.He was completely unafraid, I could see it in his eyes.You *really* want to know? he whispered.He stepped even closer, until the barrel sat between his eyes.You *reeeeallly* want to know? I could almost feel my breath on his face.His hand touched his shirt and flopped to his side, covered in blood.The phrase *caught red-handed* echoed through my mind.Tink is what dreams are made of. He laughed, a hiccuping sound you might expect to hear from a drunk deep in his cup.She steals our lives away.And takes us to Neverland. His smile turned sweet, full of tender worship."Enough already!"The traitor officer was back again, Davies, I think his name was?He hefted his own gun towards Peter's head."I need more Dust, you little shit!I need it NOW!"Now that I actually looked at his face, I could see he looked *bad.* He was sweating, his face gaunt and shallow as if he hadn't eaten for days."Oh, I'm sorry, friend," Peter simpered.I had expected to see that cold hatred back on his face, but this was almost worse."Your time is up."As I watched, I saw a darkness grow over Davies' face.His eyes closed, then flew open, eyeballs sinking into his skull, melting into a liquid blackness that first swallowed up his face, then his shoulders and arms and everything of him until he was nothing but a puddle on the floor.Peter giggled and clapped his bloody hands."Excellent, bravo!"he cried."You see, officer, that is what happens to people after they've had their first hit of the Dust.If they don't get their next one in the next 24 hours, they're swallowed by their shadow."His face darkened again."Pathetic," he spat at the puddle."Weak.I had *my* shadow exiled long ago."Then, he turned to stare piercingly into my eyes."I doubt you'll be that strong," he murmured."Crocodile, will you do the honors?"A kid, even buffer and beefier than the rest, stomped forward, an innocent paper bag in his hand.With no pretense, he shoved it over my face, covering me with powder.My gun was kicked from my hand.I tore the bag from my head, coughing out the powder, but it was too late.Desperately, I looked for an exit, but Peter's goons loomed all around me.Peter, oblivious, was rustling through his pockets.He pulled out an old-fashioned timepiece and pushed in its top.A light ticking filled the room."You've got 23 hours in Neverland, officer," Peter grinned."Enjoy your stay."
