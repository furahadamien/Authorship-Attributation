He got used to the stares...The passing faces of raw shock and unbelief...The sound of sharp inhales as they saw him.(Giovanni knew he was the only smoker left on earth and the ads on the street screens branded him evil) A screen showed an ad "The man keeping us from a perfect society."and yet he still smoked as he walked along trenchcoat flapping in the wind.He'd come into the ownership of the small tobacco farm from the only woman he had ever loved and a non-smoker, you see this woman loved her father dearly but her father refused to give up his family tobacco farm.He single-handily kept the tobacco business alive but couldn't keep himself alive so the daughter took over the business and fell in love.But it was not to last.She (In their perfect society) had lung cancer, and entrusted the most precious thing in her possession to her lover, the family farm.So when the police seized it, he had no reason to live.He walked to the edge of town smoking the very last cigarette of his life, he pulled out his revolver raised it to his head and fired without a tear.It was finally a perfect society, with one Giovanni Ash returned to ash.
