I was on my third date with a lovely woman when the tingling in my fingers started."No... Not now!""What's wrong?"Jennifer looked at me, baffled.The tingling was creeping up my arms.More intense as it spread."Uh...So, I'm going to disappear for a bit.Not sure where I'm going or when I'll be back.Just know that it has nothing to do with you.I made a promise a long time ago that I can't break.""What do you mean?You're just going to ditch me here with the check?""Listen I promise I'll explain when I can.Wait, did you check in on Facebook with me?""Of course, I wanted everyone to know that I was having a great time with what I thought was a great guy..."

She trailed off as she noticed my fingers were fading from existence.The progression was accelerating.I stood up.Next thing I know I'm standing in a dirty bathroom.My 600lb ex girlfriend sitting on the toilet with her phone in her hand looking at Facebook and crying.She sobbed at me, "You said you would always be there for me!Who is Jennifer?I'm stuck again..." Her voice trailing off meekly.I tried to just walk out the door but every time I did I simply stepped back into the bathroom."You still keep the KY in the same place?"I sighed as I opened the bathroom drawer knowing the answer.Later I tried to call Jennifer but she wouldn't answer.This is the fourth potential relationship she's ruined.I know she's doing it on purpose, but she denies it.
