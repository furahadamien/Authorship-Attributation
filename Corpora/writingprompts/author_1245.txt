Today I felt loved.No, not by my family; it's far too early for that.It felt loved by those I have never met and some I've never even heard of.Today I'll receive gifts from those I know and well wishes for the days ahead by those I do not.If only I could return the favor to them, but I will in good time.Today the world wished me a merry Christmas and I wish it one too.
