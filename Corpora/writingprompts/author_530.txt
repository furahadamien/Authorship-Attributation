ImaginedDialogue
Bert looked at his beer."Huh."The words danced a lazy, slow, circle in front of his eyes."World's #1382009216 Dad."They hadn't been there a moment ago."Hey, Joe!"The barman strolled over."What's up, Bert?Need a refill?""Where'd you get the trick mugs?""Whaddaya mean?"asked the barman, then looked at Bert's half-finished pint."See?It's got words on it, suddenly.""W-w-w-w-" said Joe.----

Bert sat on the edge of his bed, the late morning sun giving him a headache.He stared at the mug in his hands, at the words "World's #1382018297 Dad".The last digits were flickering, upwards, downwards as he stared.So, it hadn't been just the beer.His hangover pounded in his brain, seemingly in time with the spinning digits.His phone rang.He ignored it until it stopped, and kept just staring at the ever changing number on the mug

Finally, he spoke out loud to nobody."I don't even have kids!"----

He skipped the pub that evening, and woke up clear-minded on a Monday morning.It felt really weird.He quickly donned his uniform, microwaved a burrito, and almost as an afterthought, stuffed his world's #13-something dad into his backpack.Rushing to the bus stop, he noticed the sky was darker than usual.Six stops, seven, eight, then he hoisted his backpack, tagged off the bus and sprinted to the workshop."Sorry I'm late!"The supervisor looked up from the desk in the corner."Bert?""I'm sorry!""For being late?Your shift doesn't start for another hour.""What?""It's only 7 o'clock."Bert stood, stunned, while this information sank in."Look, it's great you're here, just clock in.Half the crew's called in today, I'll need you to do overtime anyway, since you're here.It's this bloody mug thing.""Mug thing?"said Bert."Yeah, don't you read the papers?Lucky you and I don't have kids, but it looks like we'll have to pick up everyone's slack for today."Bert glanced towards his backpack."Yeah, lucky.No kids," he said, flatly.----

Pete pulled up a seat next to Bert at the diner."Whatcha got there?"He said, then "Oh, my God."Bert tried to hide the mug inside his jacket, but it was obvious Pete had already seen it."I thought you didn't have kids?"Pete inquired."I...." Bert began.*I don't.I don't kave kids.... do I?*

"Let's see it," said Pete.Bert hesitantly drew it out.He could see Pete reading the number, counting the digits."Huh.""That's good, right?"said Bert."A hundred and thirty four million?""I don't think that's 134 million," said Pete, counting the digits again."It's 1.34 billion, Bert."Pete frowned sadly, then after a pause, "Still, that's good, right?There's seven million...I mean billion people in the world, after all.""They aren't all dads, Bert."Bert frowned and moved his lips, as he tried to divide seven billion by two."So, one something out of three and... a half?""Not all men are dads, Bert."Bert looked at the mug.Pete looked at Bert.Bert blinked and a tear fell.He wiped it away in embarrassed anger.Pete put his hand on Bert's arm."You have to find him, Bert.Him or her."*World's #1347710810 Dad* read the text on the mug.As Bert looked, and another tear rolled down his cheek, the 134 dropped to 133, then 132, then slowly to 131... 

"Yeah," he whispered.----

The bus station was crowded.Here, a newspaper stand boasted a headline "Jackdaw County's Best Dad!"with a smiling face holding up a mug with a really small number.There, a young man and woman sobbing in the arms of an old man.Bert looked at his own mug, frowned, left the ticket queue he was in, and started making his way to the back of the next.He'd called his supervisor and spent fifteen minutes being chewed out.Now he was here.He joined the end of the queue, and glanced at the mug.World's number 1066281104 dad.He frowned and left that queue and skipped to the end of the yet another.This time, when he glanced at the mug, he felt a thrill as he saw the number spinning down, down, past a billion, past 900 million, eventually settling on a number in the high eight hundred millions.His head was so light, it seemed almost no time at all that he was asking the clerk to suggest destinations, checking each suggestion against his mug, and emptying his wallet to pay for a ticket.Now the bus was pulling onto the highway.He stared at the mug, orange sunbeams striking the tears and the smile on his face.----

The doorbell rang.World's number 202,179,553 mum switched off the faucet, and sighed, watching the suds quietly fizzing in the sink.She sighed again, and called "Coming!"She was going to be late for work.Again.Her boss wouldn't fire her this time, though, too many people were taking time off as it was.She would tell whoever was at the door to leave, wait to be sure they had, then get her son in the car.Hopefully he'd gotten his school clothes on by himself this time.She inserted the chain latch, unbolted the door, and ....The unkempt man outside saw her face, and gasped slightly.He looked unshaven, his clothes wrinkled as if he'd slept in them.He smelled slightly.He seemed very familiar."Bertrand?"she asked."Lorraine?""What... what are you doing here?"The man opened his mouth to speak, but stopped.The skin around his eyes turned red, as if he was going to cry."I..."

"Is that really you, Bertrand?What are you doing here?""I...I got a mug."He pulled a dirty beer glass from within his jacket, and showed her."World's five ... ", she counted the digits to be sure."number five hundred million dad?"Bert's tears flowed then.Lorraine watched him sob, sob and sob and sob, watched his tears trickle and his nose go runny.She had no idea what to do or say.A small voice spoke behind her, "Mum, who's at the door?"
