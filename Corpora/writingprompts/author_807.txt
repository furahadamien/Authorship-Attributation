Do you have any last words? the man by the machine asks.He does so matter-of-factly, with no sarcasm or disdain, as if hes done it a thousand times before.I look away from him, into the eyes beyond the glass; its here I find my vitriol.Her eager anticipation to witness a justified and sudden revenge is palpable.Just a few, I reply, locking my gaze deeply into hers, Ill see you in hell.

The man flips a couple switches, then pulls a lever.Vials above the machine begin to drain one by one, feeding into a line piercing my left arm.I do not struggle against my bonds.She smiles.I lean my head back and await my deliverance.I close my eyes.Moments pass, and I open my eyes again.Im still here.I look to the man.He seems confused.I look back out to her, and the smile has faded from her face.An older man next to her stands up and approaches the window, reaching out toward a panel at its side.Whats going on? his voice barks into the room, Did it not take?

Well try again, sir, the man at the machine replies.He leaves the room briefly and returns with more vials, replacing the empty ones in the machine.Once more the switches are flipped, the lever is pulled, and the fluids are drained.Once more I do not die.Members of the audience are murmuring amongst themselves now.She is visibly angered at this point, clenching her fingers deep into the bag on her lap.Im almost sorry for her disappointment.The old man is on his feet once more and approaching the window when suddenly the lights go black with a loud *ka-chunk*, replaced almost immediately by the red glow of emergency back-ups.A blaring siren begins to sound, prompting the swift and panicked exit of everyone in both rooms.Im left alone.I sit like this for awhile, Im not sure how long.The siren soon stops.I listen to the scuffling of footsteps outside and wait to see if anyone comes to return me to my cell or at the very least shoot me in the face and be done with it, but nobody does.Whatever is happening, it must be serious to leave someone like me unattended.When the last of the footfalls are but a distant echo, and despite promising myself I wouldnt, my boredom gets the better of me and I lift my arms, tugging at the straps locked on my wrists.I dont have to strain too hard before my bonds snap.I reach down and release my feet, then slide off the chair.The door to the hall is unlocked, and stepping through I find an empty corridor.Gate after gate, door after door, theyre all left either ajar or unlocked as I head toward an exit.Nobody is here to stop me.I walk out the front door, leaving the dim red emergency lights behind me, and step into a nearly pitch black night.My death was scheduled for the morning, was I really in there that long?I look up to the sky and see no stars, and can actually make out the faint shape of dark swirling clouds.I hear several loud bangs in the distance.I cross the parking lot and make my way up toward the top of a hill at its edge.Reaching the summit, I bear witness to a confusing, yet beautiful scene.The city is ablaze, with dozens of massive plumes of smoke billowing up into a sea of black ash above.Centred over the city is a colossal vortex of fire, pulsing and throbbing, spewing out a cascade of dark figures.Red lightning occasionally crackles from the vortex, emitting massive explosions among the buildings, and even at this distance a roaring wave of a thousand screams can be heard humming beneath the chaos.I begin to walk toward the city.In the surrounding fields I pass countless terrified faces hurrying past in the opposite direction.In the city streets I witness blackened corpses frozen in place amid crumbled buildings, burnt out vehicles, and more fleeing civilians.As I approach the middle of the city I see a growing crowd of people circling a dark, shifting pile of...something.I join the crowd, pushing closer to the front, and can discern what the pile is; a writhing mass of disfigured human faces and mutilated appendages.More and more parts tumble from the vortex above, slamming into the pile and becoming tangled up in it.The crowd silently watches the pile grow, until it finally seems to stop.A low rumbling shakes the ground as the vortex appears to begin collapsing.Just as the wreath of fire in the sky closes in on itself, a final figure is vomited from its depths.It slams into the top of the pile, landing on one knee.It raises its head, then slowly stands itself upright.Its shaped like a man, naked, with cracked grey skin scarred thousands of times over, and eye sockets black and hollow save for a fiery glowing ember in each.He extends an arm, palm upturned, and addresses the crowd.**THE TIME HAS FINALLY COME**, he bellows in a deep, raspy voice, **SATAN...IS DEAD.THE WAR FOR HELL IS OVER.MAN NOW HOLDS THE KEYS TO THE CIRCLES.IF YOU ARE HERE, IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE KIN.WE, THE WICKED, FOR WHOM THERE IS NO PLACE IN PARADISE**.

He thrusts out his other arm, turning to see more of the gathering.**WITH THE LORD OF INFERNO DETHRONED, WE ARE FREE FROM DEATH.OUR BRETHREN ARE GATHERING ALL AROUND THE WORLD.LET US JOIN THEM, AND CLEANSE THE EARTH OF THE RIGHTEOUS AND MEEK**.

The pile stirs and the writhing parts coalesce into individual beings, clawing their way out from the bottom and onto their feet.They join the ranks of the crowd as it turns back outward.I march with my fellow murderers, thieves, liars, and rapists.An immortal army of the unworthy, with footholds all around the world.Perhaps I was too eager to die.This should be fun...
