Youd think having a luck rating of 100 would have made life a walk in the park.That the world around you would be all sunshine and daisies.It wasnt.The problem is, a luck rating like that tends to warp the world around you.For everything to always go your way, someone else often must pay the price.Even worse, you dont get to choose what the world decides you need.A single stray thought could result in catastrophe happening all around you.Like the time when a sudden ice cream craving caused a mid-air collision between two 747s, startling a woman who saw it enough to knock her AC unit out of her apartment window and crush the owner of an ice cream cart at the top of the hill.His cart rolled right at me but halted abruptly when that Wall St exec tripped right in front of it, breaking his arm.I would have just paid for the damn ice cream, but I dont get to choose when Im gonna be lucky.The relief when the Council of the Odds finally found me was insurmountable, even knowing that it wouldnt last.The cell they put me in was barren with nothing around me.No padding, mattresses, entertainment, or even a toilet.It was heavenly, even though I knew it couldnt last.I knew with time, luck would find a way to get me out.As I settled in, I heard a faint crash in the distance followed by hundreds of clicks.My door creaked open.Apparently, 777 prisoners was too much for the Luck Agents to contain.
