LeakySkylight
Unlike the past Wars, where boots pounded through the mud and bullets rip through flesh, World War 3 was fought on a different type of Battle Ground; The Internet.Long ago people had abandoned the outside world to live freely in VR.With AI running most factories and Supply chains, it was no longer required for humans to be outside.No longer judged by appearance, humans could live a free existence online.Unfortunately, factions started causing issues, microtransactions from different countries and censorship.Corrupt individuals and servers and parties would let people through for a price.Eventually, it came to blows, where goverment sanctioned hackers could obliterate entire worlds, or crash Banks, or virtually vaporize communities.After trillions of dollars in Virtual damage had been done, and even citizens erased from Global databases, higher Powers determined that it would be best if all the parties at play would separate and run their own Networks.50 years later, the US decided to rejoin the global network, only to find that the entire world started working together.To their surprise, they discovered that there were no longer Banks, nor Finance-laden systems, but nothing less than complete Harmony of data interchange.People, emotion, and experience free for all to create unlimited Virtual Worlds and live in peace..This however was completely moot, as soon after the US join the world in there beautiful new digital utopia, a robot janitor unpluged the grand master router to plug in his vacuum cleaner, and the whole thing came crashing to a halt.
