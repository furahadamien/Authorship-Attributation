Another job another person begging for help.Not that I mind it, it's all about helping people after all.Hundreds of years of medical knowledge and the injuries more or less stay the same.Stab wounds turned into bullet wounds but all yield the same result: death.Not me though, somehow my halfassed patch job for some kid during a battle garnered me immortality.Not God like immortality where nothing hurts but immortality where everything somehow heals with all the pain included.I've been shot in the head, stabbed, choked, cut in half, and burned alive too many times to count."Hey Chuck we're here, looks like a guy got shot in the leg.""Alright, how did it happen?"I asked why looking through my bag to clean the wound."I uh, was showing my buddy my new 9mm and I dropped it and it went off and it shot me" 

The best part about this job is that one thing never changes in over the 300 years I have been patching people up: people are stupid as hell.After gathering my things I walk over to the poor stupid soul and lay out the tools to start to remove the bullet.The patient looks visibly scared and starts shaking.As I'm preparing to make my first move Becky grabs my arm.Becky has been by my side for 15 years now.A small fraction in an eternity but she has made the idea of living in the moment all the more nicer."Um I think we dont need that Chuck"

Confused I look down at my hand which was grasping a bone saw ready to cut.I was shocked for a moment but then started laughing like I was crazy.I looked at Becky and asked "Um Beck, what year are we in?".She responded " Um, 2019 Chuck" "Right, modern times require modern solutions" I said playfully as I quickly walked back to my bag to grab some pliers.That's one of the downsides of immortality, the decades tend to meld together sometimes.
