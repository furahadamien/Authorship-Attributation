IAmTheMadLord
I sat in the dark, my phone, even set to silent, constantly making noise across the room.I didn't bother getting up to check it, it was always the same message, had been for the last two hours now.Some mess of 'go outside, look at the moon.'Even if I wasn't an introvert, something is wrong with that.I don't even know the sheer number of people sending me messages.And of course, the official notice to not look at the moon helped me be sure something was off, at least until it changed to say to go outside too.About an hour after I threw my phone across the room, I heard a knock at my apartment door.It hasn't stopped, even though I can see blood at the base of the door, coming in through a tiny crack between it and the floor.Occasionally the knocking stops and I hear the sound of them trying to open the door.In case they try to break in, I've got my pocket knife in hand.I watched the clock as the time passed, 5AM, 5:30, 6AM.The knocking continued.It wasn't long till morning, right?Surely whatever was happening would stop when the sun rose.At 6:30, the person knocking on my door started talking.Calling me by name, with a voice I didn't recognize.Hell, if it was one of my friends I might have opened the door.But whoever this was, I didn't know them.I sighed, standing up and pacing on the rug, so my footsteps were quiet.Even so, whoever was knocking heard them.They started knocking harder.Calling me out.Why wouldn't I just come outside, see the moon?Maybe because you've been knocking on my goddamn door for two and a half hours now.I waited, waited for the sun to come up.7AM, then 7:30.I knew this time of year, dawn should be soon!Surely when the sun rises, they'll go away, the messages will stop.It's 9AM now, and the knocking still hasn't stopped.I'm reading to pass time, or playing games.Servers for everything are still up, but chat is filled with spam about the moon, just like my phone.Still, it's better than just waiting around listening to the knocking.I'd put my headphones in, but then I might not hear whoever it is breaking in if they get desperate.9:30 AM, the knocking has stopped.Is it finally over?My phone is still being bombarded, but the knocking has stopped... Maybe another hour or two, to be sure.At 9:45 I heard footsteps in the hall again, then a slam as something hit my door.I picked up my knife and hid, watching the door.After a moment, a fire axe slammed through, cutting a hole in the door, and I got my first glimpse of the person who'd been knocking for the last five hours, and I knew the official warning had been right.Their skin was grey like ash, and their eyes were glazed over, like a blind man's.But they looked around the room like they could see perfectly, passing over my hiding place as they searched.They brought the axe back up and kept swinging, chopping down the door methodically, over the course of about 15 minutes.It would have gone much faster, if not for the strange, jerky movements they used to move any limb.They entered the apartment at 10AM, calling out for me again.I got my knife ready as they walked past my hiding spot, and jumped out, slamming the knife into their neck.They fell, and I shook my head.I'd never... hurt anyone.The knife was only here for self defense, but if this wasn't, I don't know what is.Whatever the case... now I don't have a door, and I can't stay here.But I can't go outside, not while the moon might still be visible in the sky.I resolved to wait another hour, until 11AM.Surely by then the moon would be below the horizon.Over the hour that passed, another three of the strange people came, all calling for anyone who hadn't come outside.I didn't recognize the names they called, but one called mine and came for my apartment.I had to kill him too, or he would have dragged me outside.But since them, I haven't heard anything, it's deadly silent.Hell, at 11 even my phone went silent.That must mean it's over, right?Another hour... another hour and I'm going to go outside.I looked outside, and everything is dark.And I mean EVERYTHING.It's noon, where's the sunlight?Now I know how they find the people who haven't come out yet, our houses are the only beacons of light.I don't dare to look up, not while I'm looking outside.I went back inside, and saw one of the blind people walking into my apartment through the hole in the door.I guess I'm not safe in there now.Now I'm in the basement of my building, the only way in is a solid steel trap door in the ground floor.There's no way light can escape, so I'm fine keeping the lights on down here.I brought a laptop, a charger for it, and enough food to last a few days.I'm going to wait it out.There's no way this madness will last.It's Thursday now, this whole mess started Sunday.I haven't heard anything over the last few days, but the servers for a lot of things have gone down.I stopped being able to log into steam Tuesday.Discord's still up, but there hasn't been a message since Sunday when the talk about the moon stopped.I guess they thought everyone had seen it.I still have my knife down here with me, but hell, if I decide to end it, I want to see what all this was about before I bleed out.It's noon on Saturday, and I'm out of food.Almost a full week after all this started, and I can't hide down here any longer.It's clear whatever happened was a world-wide event, and with no food down here, I have to go outside.But the blind people are still out there, presumably the whole population of the earth, minus myself.Nothing more to do, really.Guess this is the end.There's still no sunlight.We've been in a nearly week long, total solar eclipse.Looking at my knife, I wonder if I'd bleed out before or after whatever happens if I look at the moon happens.With a sigh of resigning myself to my fate, I stabbed the knife into my neck, and looked up.The creature hanging in front of the moon looked back at me.It tilted its head in confusion, watching me bleed out in the street.It's body glowed, and it hung in place, its limbs spread as if crucified, but nothing held the creature up.It was clearly at least humanoid, but definitely not anything we were ever meant to see.And then I heard its voice.A voice clearly alien, not a language, but I understood it even so.It asked why I refused the end it brought, why I waited so long to look.Even if I could answer, if blood wasn't filling my windpipe, I wouldn't have.I looked back down at my hands, and watched them turn gray.Before long, I fell to the ground, and passed out.
