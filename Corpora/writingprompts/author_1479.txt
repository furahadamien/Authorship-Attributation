I audibly groaned as that familiar tune began playing on the television.I pressed fast-forward on the remote several times before the screen reminded me: "This program cannot be fast-forwarded".Those clever bastards."Olivia was a happy and healthy child".The voice spoke softly over the photograph of 8 year-old me."We don't know what makes someone turn to tobacco use.But we do know that Olivia's mother would be disappointed to see her only daughter throw her life away for this addiction".The picture changed and I turned off the TV.It wasn't worth it sometimes.I stepped onto the back porch.My hand trembled as I fumbled with the lighter.That ad was by far the worst that they've made.It's impact was probably more a negative one if anything.I inhaled strongly.Standing on that porch, I remember thinking about how that "Quit Smoking" ad was a low point for the writers.I was, regretfully; deeply mistaken....

"Well it got a 89% on Rotten Tomatoes"

"Yeah but I heard it was really bad"

"I think it should be good"

"I hope it is but I'm just sayin' that it might not be"

"Shhh it's starting"

The lights dimmed in the already ill-lit theater.Sammy reached over and grabbed a handful of popcorn.A preview for that new superhero movie played.Then another for some cheesy rom-com.Then, the newest "Quit Smoking" ad started.I froze mid-popcorn grab."We all know smoking is bad for your health.*But* according to a recent  study, it also makes you less attractive.We interviewed several men on the street."The screen panned over to an interviewer holding a microphone up to a man wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses."No I would never date a smoker.It's a gross habit.Olivia is the last person I would ever consider dating."The scene shifted to the same interviewer but with a different man.I was already halfway out the theater.I couldn't hear anymore.Sammy jumped out of her seat when she noticed me leaving, "Hey!Wait!"I didn't matter: I wouldn't let her catch up to me.After that ad, much more, nastier ones began to emerge.Closeups of my teeth and referring to them as "stained".Bad photographs of me while a mystery voice lectured about how smoking leads to bad skin.I spent a lot of time inside.Hell, I even began to smoke indoors.I wouldn't risk going outside.The smoke was brutal on the furniture.Especially since I had went from 2-3 cigarettes a day to half a pack a day.It was probably 7 weeks after the movie theater incident when people began knocking on my door.I knew better than to answer.They slipped fliers underneath that showed diseased lungs and cancer patients on their death beds and the whole 9 yards.Sammy tried to call a few times but I let it go to voicemail.I was too embarrassed.Also I solely made the decision that she shouldn't be involved with me.For her own good.I knew what I had to do.I walked up the full 6 flights of stairs and stepped through the door onto the roof.I couldn't see my back porch from here.I took out a cigarette and lit it.For once, my hand had stopped shaking.I stood close to the ledge and watched the amber sun sink into the horizon.I flung the cigarette butt over the edge.I pulled out my pack, still half full, and threw that over as well.I did it.I finally quit smoking.I breathed in the fresh air and closed my eyes.I kept them closed as I walked off the roof.
