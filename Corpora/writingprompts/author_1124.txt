I stared at the corner, where two walls joined.The thing about eternity, is that small fragments of time cease to mean anything.When you're twenty, a year goes by like a month.When you're 50, they seem to fly by like days.I was lucky enough to leave that concept behind before I got too far beyond 50.I had been staring at the wall for a very long time.I flexed my hand, feeling the immaterium of my projected consciousness stretch and contort, ghosts of tendons displacing veins and muscle, which only existed for as long as my attention span.It was translucent, but only because I knew what was inside.I returned my blank gaze to studying the wall.I knew what kind of Nothing was inside that too.The Room constituted Everything.The sum capacity of my new universe was 15ft by 15ft by 15ft.And the Book.I felt another well of discomfort, rising in a throat that didn't exist, anxiety flooding through my body, imaginary hormones riding blood that dried up centuries ago.Centuries?Centuries.Probably.Those things hadn't meant anything for a while.At first I had obsessively kept track of time, guessing and reguessing and estimating and correcting.That mania overtook me about twenty years in, but after a while, I realised that time only meant something when it was heading somewhere.There was only This.There was only Now.There was only the Book.And there was The Wall.Steven studied the wall.It was smooth, and grey, and if he concentrated hard enough, he could see the swirls in the fabric of reality, compounded and solidified into this glorious, perfect monument, exact, square, and _solid_.If he peered in, deeper, hot, white clusters pulsate, flitting around each other in a flirtatious dance, twining themselves in strands of ether, never quite touching, until, rejected, they collapse, retreat, and form a new dance.Or maybe they didn't.He reached out to touch the wall, and found that his fingers met substance.He felt the distal phalange of his index finger squish through meat, straining to make contact, to reach through the wall and join the cosmic dance.A tear that didn't exist rolled down a face that had never been seen.One was joined by others, which became None as soon as they left his face.He stroked the wall with five finger tips, and let his hand find the corner.He hadn't moved away from the corner for a very long time.He hadn't looked at the Book for even longer.A while ago, he switched corners, but that was just because he came to know all of the white specks on that side.He predicted a year's worth of their movements, and after that he got bored.He had laughed when he first woken up with the book, and spent a year studiously ignoring it.To acknowledge it would be to give power to whatever put him here.And anyway, he was never much of a reader.But sooner or later, he had thumbed it open.Later, in this case.As his thoughts on time shifted, Later ceased to exist.The thing about eternity is, you'll do anything to fill the now, to push Later out of your mind.Later isn't something that you want to exist.The Book was a thing of beauty.The cover was plain, and uninteresting, but it was so unassailably _real_, that it felt like it carried the sum total of everything inside.Maybe it did.Despite the number of pages, they never ran out.You flick 10,000 pages to find out where one option takes you, and still find yourself in the middle.That's part of the problem.It was entertaining for a while.Steven saw where his life led, and then the life of somebody almost like him.And then somebody slightly further away, a distant, less Steven, Steven.In fact, Steven had read, lead, visualised and been defeated, loved, lost, murdered, been killed, died of diabetes, killed himself, killed the president, _loved_ the president, a million times over.A billion.It was like an eternity of films.In fact, Steven had lived so many lives, so many Reals that were so different from his own, that Steven no longer remembered which was his own.In fact, the only concrete thing that Steven had left, was the fact that his name was Stephen.His tears dry by themselves, eventually, and he turns his head to the center of the room, to look at the Book, drawing everything Real into it, like a black hole drawing in light.He stands, and stretches out of habit, feeling muscles sliding over rib bones, feeling lungs expand with un-air.He turns the rest of his body, and begins to place one foot in front of the other.The corner that he was sitting in, and two pieces of wall attached, slowly disperse back into the immaterium.
