It all happened so suddenly I wasn't even sure it was real.The Blinding.That's what it was called.It was just a regular summer morning.I was coated in sweat, tapping a pencil on the desk, wondering what I could do.All other days have been uneventful.I sighed and closed my eyes shut, deep in thought.I suddenly hear my mother scream my dads name from the kitchen."George!"In a panic, my eyes flew open and my head darts around the room but it was still dark.I swallow a lump in my throat."Mama!?"I shout.I rubbed my eyes and opened them again but I still couldn't see anything.A loud crash was heard from the living room followed by my dad cursing.Our confused yelling woke my older sister.She groaned and for a second she made no noise before letting out a blood curdling scream.That day I lost hope for a lot of things.Becoming an artist, learning sign language (it would be impossible), and quite a lot more.It became difficult to do the things I was once good at, which wasn't that many things in the first place.We also had to give up our pet birds.We couldn't have them roaming around the house without accidentally stepping on them and that fear forced us to let go.Those who were unaffected, who were already blind before the incident, had taken it upon themselves to help us navigate through our daily lives.Although we no longer struggled as much with their help, I was sad I would no longer see the sunset or sunrise, my favorite color, my family.Two years had passed and surprisingly, I felt better than I probably would have when I had sight.My friend, Emma, was over at my house and we had fun listening to podcasts on a radio, eating junk food and just being around each other in general.We would always jokingly say "I may not have sight, but I do have vision.", immediately bump into something on accident and laugh.This day couldn't get any better.I think to myself and lazily close my eyes.I reopened them and suddenly felt a deja vu from two years ago.I squinted at how bright it was and it took me a good few seconds to adjust to all the light pouring through the windows.My breath got stuck in my throat for a moment.Something was staring back at me, copying the same motions I made.My reflection.I looked at the white wall and took note of the large black print on it.I shakily stood up and made my way towards the lettering and caress the braille beneath it.Don't Tell Them You Can See."Yo, Josie, ya good?"My silence had concerned Emma and a muted yelp escaped my bosom when I turned to look at her.The person in Emma's spot had long chestnut hair, and dots, which I could assume were freckles, adorned her pale skin and rosy cheeks.Her eyes were closed.Heat rose to my cheeks and I coughed."Yeah, yeah, I'm good."
