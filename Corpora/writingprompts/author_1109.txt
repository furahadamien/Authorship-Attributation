"We were not the first.There is a russian flag on mars."The silence in the Mission control center was crushing.Everyone just stared at the big screen.Waiting for something to break the tension.But nothing did.They had planned for thousands of errors, difficulties, unlikelyhoods, but not for this.What does this mean?How could this have happened?Everyone in the room had the same thoughts.Noone had the answers.Suddenly, a crackling noise signaled that the speaker system was turned on: "Uhm... s-so I think you should see this, it is broadcasting on all channels, nationwide..." The message on the big screen disappeared.Instead, a black screen, on which, in red lettering, the following words appeared: "To the people of the United States of America" A few seconds passed, noone even dared to blink.Then a familiar face appeared on the screen.Vladimir Putin, his piercing blue eyes seemed to see straight into the soul of everyone watching.

"America.Your time of perceived dominance is over.As a select few at your NASA headquarters learned a few minutes ago, your astronauts were not the first to set foot on the planet mars.Russian cosmonauts did so in 1998, 20 years ago, without your knowledge.The reason you learn of this now, is that the time has come for your pathetic country to cease existing as a sovereign nation and become a vassal to the glorious russian federation.We want to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, so let me make it clear, that resistance, of any kind, is futile.20 years ago we had the technology to send our cosmonauts to mars and return them unharmed, without your intelligence agencies noticing.Our technology was and still is so superior to yours, that it was as easy as hiding a toy from a child.But that is not all.Our own intelligence agencies were able to infiltrate almost every area of your military, your scientific community and your government.We even managed to infiltrate your highest office.Your current President, Donald Trump has been working for our country since I personally promised him the Oval Office five years ago.Once he saw the extend of our knowledge and power, he recognized that in an open conflict, our nation would have obliterated your country.As you can see, resistance is truly futile.The war is over.You lost.There will be no mercy to anyone who dares oppose us.Now, in case there is any doubt to my words, I present to you, your president."The camera panned to the right and focused on another familiar face, it's orange tone a stark contrast to the former."Well, thank you Mr. President..."
