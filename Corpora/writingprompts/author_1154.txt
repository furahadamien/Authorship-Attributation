Why are the writing prompts in this subreddit ALWAYS sci-fi or "mind fuck" themed in some way?Is it just the only type of writing people seem to be interested in or is it a requirement for this sub?I wouldn't mind seeing some stories just about some interesting characters where the focus is actually on the creativity of the writing.
