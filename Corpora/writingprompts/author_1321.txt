A young man stands in front of a crowded board room his presentation is impeccable.He's worked his way up from intern to junior exec, and it's taken years of late nights to get him to this point.His smart blue suit only slightly lighter than the others in the room, his tie a perfect accent piece to his pocket square which sets off his wire frame glasses.The young man continues his well rehearsed diatribe, "You'll see in the graph here that..." A cloud of smoke envelopes him and then dissipates leaving the rest of the attendees in awe.Across the country on a small studio lot just outside of Los Angeles a woman sits on a curb eating a sandwich when smoke begins to materialize, the young man appears before her eyes in a brilliant shimmer of folded space which looks as if someone smeared the background."Oh  *you're*  here."The young woman remarks.He turns around investigating his new surroundings before looking down at the girl, "Jesus Christ Keri, what the hell do you want?""Well I didn't want *you* ."She answers before discarding the food on the ground."Uh, yeah Keri, that's how this works.Remember?In perhaps the most regretful phrase I've ever uttered in my life, I pledged to always be there for you.Then a skank in pink heart print dress appeared and said 'So it shall be, always.'So now when you want me, and only me I fucking appear wherever you are.I was only fifteen how the hell is that binding?!?"The woman shrugged and said, "Well as long as you're here, the studio says they'll give me a line if I show my breasts in the movie.Should I do it?""Yes, of course you should," The young man replied.As soon as Keri's back was turned he began to give her the finger with both hands."You really think I should?Don't you think that could hurt  my career?I want to be thought of as a serious actress..." She turned around suddenly to see both of his middle fingers outstretched in an aggressive, and angry way."Brad... god damn it, I'm serious.""I don't give a flying red headed fuck what you do, the perpetually pink bitch made it so I have to be here, she didn't make me feel the need to be helpful.Your tits have been all over the internet for years.Remember when we broke up and you got on Girls Gone Wild?Yeah so there isn't a pervy old man in America who hasn't spanked it to your underage, and until verrrry recently undersized chest; by the way tell your doctor I love his work, and leave me the fuck alone!"She smiled at him, "You're jealous, I'm here shooting a film with the guy who played on Renegade and you're stuck in your little cubicle back home.Why can't you just be happy for me you piece of shit?""I was in the middle of a meeting that would have made me a partner.I have a girl I'm crazy about, and she puts up with this popping back and forth thing for god knows why, and I'm jealous?"The two screaming at each other drew the ire of the director who then stormed over to the pair, "Who are you?"He demanded.Brad sighed and said, "I'm Brad her ex boyfriend."The director threw out his hands with his palms raised, "Do you work here?""No."He turned his attention to the young woman, "And you, who the hell are you?""um...I'm Keri.I play Sorority slasher victim 2.""Not anymore, you're fired.Steven, get me casting, I need another big breasted bimbo to show her tits in this piece of shit.Let's go, we're moving on."Keri stood there her mouth agape, then she turned to look at Brad who's lips had begun to curl upwards at the corners, "You... this is all your fault.Fix it, fix it now."Brad broke out into a bright white smile as karma finally caught up with Keri.He did his best to snap his lips closed but the joy was just so overwhelming he broke into a slight laugh as he said, "Why?Remember I don't have to help, I just have to be there for you.""Well how are you going to like it if I suddenly need a towel boy at 2:AM your time for the foreseeable future after I swipe right on every guy in LA?Fix this now."Brad visibly gulped and said, "Excuse me Mr. Director..."
