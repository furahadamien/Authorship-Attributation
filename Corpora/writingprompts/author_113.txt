In my life, I didn't believe in God.I didn't believe in Heaven or Hell.I didn't believe in rebirth, or reincarnation, any of that.I was not a spiritual man.But in those last moments, I didn't care about any of that.Trapped under that car, with my pulse fading and my breathing slowing, I was completely calm.My thoughts were collected and there was one main thing I was thinking about: what happens to me now?Being 63, I knew that death was nearing, so I made a will.I was to be buried, with my house going to my oldest son, Dennis, and my fortune being split amongst all of my children.I had lived a full and great life, and I was accepting of death, although not ready for it.What was going to happen, though?Spiritually, I mean?Does nothing happen?Do I get judged for my actions and sent to paradise or torment?Do I get reborn?Whichever, I just wished that I was going to be happy.With that, my blood ran too low for survival, my heart stopped, and I closed my eyes.It seemed as if I had woken up from a long sleep.There was applause.I thought maybe I had fallen asleep at the play, and that I had never driven home, it was just a dream.I looked around and found that I was in a movie theatre, with me in front of the screen and an audience of around 500 in front of me.Obviously, I was confused.Then, I realized.This is death.Death is... free refills on your popcorn and drink.Endless pleasure.I guess it was kinda like heaven.People came up to me to congratulate me on the long life while they were loading the next movie.These people were anywhere from 6 to 40.I, apparently, was the oldest reincarnation.I got my free popcorn and drink, and sat down to watch the life of Leslie Powers, a girl living in the 1950s.
