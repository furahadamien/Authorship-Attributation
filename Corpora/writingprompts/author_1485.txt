EvenBetterThanIWas
I walk around everyone is smiling.Smiling.Ear to ear.Cheek to cheek.That shit eating grin that only you know about seeing these days.You're walking down the side walk in the down town district.You pull out your box.You light a cigarette.You begin to walk the sidewalk towards the down town district.You smoke your cigarette while everyone stares out you.Like rveryone hates you for simply making your own choice.Everything in life tells you that you shouldn't.You do it anyways.The world needs people like you.There are two types of people.Those who the waiter tells you "it's a hot plate" and you don't touch it.And those who touch the plate to find out how hot the plate actually is.That's who you are.You are the last of them.Remember that.You ash your cigarette on the ground squashing it like a bug.You look up and see a giant screen in the downtown district.The screen displays a commercial that's just starting.Like comment subscribe for more ;)
