I won't lie.I am in this for the money.Some of my "colleagues"--if you can call them that--are out to settle old scores.Society shit on them and theirs, and now they want to be the ones to do the shitting.I never got that.This business is *hard*.Too hard to stay in just to reap some *schadenfreude*.Others I work with are in it for the power.They don't like the way things are, and they figure they ought to be in charge.Funny thing is history doesn't remember kindly too many people with that attitude.If you think you are making things better, maybe you should wonder why they call you a villain.Then there are the crazy ones.I mean honestly and deeply disturbed.The guys who got off on burning ants as a kid and decided that school buses would be more fun.I try to stay away from those guys, but when The Bloodhound is sniffing around, the smell of burning flesh gets him off the case pretty quick.Me?I just want to make a quick buck.I like nice things, and my "skills" can be lucrative.Very lucrative, as long as I work with people who aren't too worried about ethics.I tried honest work.Really, I did.But I saw how much money I was generating for the owners of the places I worked, and how that compared to the money they were giving me in return.I realized pretty quick that I was a sucker.I thought that the best thing to do was become more like them.I saved up enough to start my own business, but I found out pretty quick that the rules are not there to help the new guy catch up.No, the rules are there to make sure that I don't cut in to anyone else's slice of the pie, and to make sure that everyone else cut's in to mine.So when I had my "accident" and woke up hearing the thoughts of the people around me, my first thought was "how can I monetize this"?Okay, that wasn't my *first* thought.I spent some time worrying about my sanity--who wouldn't.But once I got past that it was all about the dollar signs.Let me tell you, gambling is really, *really* easy when everyone unknowingly tells you what cards they have.Problem is that after a while no one wants you playing at their table.And after a few months of raking in the cash, I wasn't about to stop fleecing the fat cats.Do you realize how many times a day you share a room with someone who thinks a password out loud?A combination to a lock?The name of the company that their client is secretly planning a merger with?Take advantage of enough secrets like that and you can get rich.I mean very, *very* rich.The only problem is that, in a world like this, someone, somewhere is bound to figure out that you are not playing by the same rules as the ordinary folk.The first "hero" to come after me was Komrade.The self-righteous son-of-a-bitch was always looking to show that the newly rich didn't deserve to be there.And his Robin Hood schtick made him a real hit with the old-money country-club liberals he loved to rub hypocritical elbows with.Of course the poor bastard didn't know *how* I was doing what I was doing, so it was pretty damn easy to notice him tailing me.Now in a "fair" fight I am no match for a man with super strength.But as far as I am concerned the only fair fight is the fight I win.I let him tail me into an abandoned warehouse one night.He thought--wrongly--that it was my hideout.Hell, you should have heard what he was thinking, the praise he was heaping on himself, the positively effusive way he was gushing over his impending victory.I remember how he was guessing what my excuses would be  when he confronted me.But he never heard anything of the kind.He never heard my shot, either.You see, a man that self-assured tends to forget that the enemy has a say in things.Once I slipped into the warehouse I dashed to the spot I had prepared in the shadows.When he didn't see me he knew it was an ambush.The oaf stood there waiting to hear what I had to say.He thought I played by the rules, that I would have some speech ready for him.But playing by the rules isn't how I got to where I am today.He never heard a thing.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Welp, there is my fist submission.Thank you u/Kyevin for the prompt that finally got me to sit down and right one of these.I know I focused a lot more on the "no ego" piece than the "lethal" piece, but I guess I just felt like an origin story.And thank you, dear reader, for taking the time to look at something this far down the chain.If you have any feedback, let me have it.
