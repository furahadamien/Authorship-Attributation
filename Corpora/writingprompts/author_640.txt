The Fountain of Youth.A blessed spring that would restore any who bathed in it back to the prime of their life.Many tales have been told of it's existence, and many have spent their lives searching for it.And now, thanks to a group of scientists working for Big Pharma, you can buy it over the counter.Bottled, carbonated and in the flavor of your choice.I was 28, not long off my 29th birthday when they broke the news.Science had done it, it had broken into the realm once thought only for Gods.Immortality could be yours, forever.But only to those under the age of 26.I remember thinking how unlucky I was, missing the boat by only a couple of years, though my life carried on as normal and it wasn't until I was in my late 40s that I began to truly appreciate that fact.I started to slow down, aches and pains taking root, my skin wrinkling and my hair adopting a silvery hue.I was getting old.I wasn't the only one of course, there were lots of us, we of the "Lost Generation" as we came to call ourselves.Doomed to die as nature intended.I still meet with some regularly actually, getting to bitch about the entitled youngsters with others was welcome catharsis.Hell, I know one guy, missed the deadline by a day.A *day*.I couldn't imagine what that must have done to him.There aren't many of us left these days, Age claiming it's final victims slowly but surely, it'll be coming for me soon enough I'm sure.Not too long after it's release Goverment officials signed legislation that ensured everyone under the age of 26, regardless of race, gender or wealth, could access the drug.Once a person turned 18, they could decide to get the treatment, as Immortality had to be a choice, though to this day I still haven't heard of a single person who turned it down.Doesn't hurt, far as I've been told, just a couple of shots; one into your arm, one into the base of your neck.Probably not as bad as I make it sound and compared to Immortality, what's a couple of little pricks, right?Nearly 60 years after the fact everyone I know is either an Immortal, or an old wreck like me.And for the first time ever, I'm glad that I never got that choice because in hindsight, what Age has put me through wasn't too bad and I know soon, hell, maybe even tomorrow, it'll be over.We of the "Lost Generation" used to joke that the Immortals weren't human anymore, turns out we weren't too far from the truth.It's funny how in 60 years, no one thought to question how they did it, how they acquired immortality.I guess our fear of death blinded us to reality.Gene-splicing.Take a bit of reptile, some insect, throw in a bit of flora for good measure, mix it up on a Petri dish and voila!Viral treatments to alter the genome, to turn off chromosomes, introduce new gene sequences to fill in the gaps and fix the degenerative nature of cell replication.The makings of an Immortal.And the death of Humanity.
