Everyone on earth had called me a coward.A man who surrendered to the aliens, a man who had sold out humanity.The man who had caused the deaths of thousands of people.I remember watching the last man on earth die, a celebration for the alien force that had invaded, a bug scraped off of their shoes.And as that man died, I felt something within me, something big.Then, light blinded me, and everything around me was dead.Y'know as the sun explodes, and the aliens start to panic, I'm left here waiting for that grim liberation.I have one thought."How ironic is it that the man who doomed humanity would avenge it?"
