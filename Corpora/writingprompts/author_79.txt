If I shared anything with my reincarnations, it was in our belief in fate.Though each previous version of me held a very different perspective of it.The me that had died in the Great Depression thought it a terrible thing, wicked and omnipotent.The me that had lived as king in the middle ages thought it a gift presented by God.Me, I believed it a promise.My next reincarnation was a baby with deep blue eyes and pink skin named George.He started his life alone.George cried so much that they had to put him in a separate room, devoid of the other infants.A nurse checked in on him every few hours.Nobody blamed her.She had more pressing matters to attend to, such as Georges mother, whose heart rate was steadily growing out of control and her breathing stuttered.When the young lady died, she did so whispering her sons name.I wasnt sure if she ever even got a look at him.In that hospital room, with the flat-line beep of a heart rate monitor, the nurse checking on George stood, lips quivering and fists clenched.In this world, children were supposed to be loved by their parents.If not the mother, who else would?For George, it was nobody, not even himself.The orphanage boasted posters of smiling blonde-haired boys and girls with deep blue eyes.George couldve been a literal poster boy if he ever smiled.But no matter how many stuffed animals they threw his way, how many hugs and smiles they offered him, they could never get those lip-locked edges to curve up.By the time he had hit thirteen, he had already smoked his first cigarette and drank his first beer.Nobody wanted to tell him, but everybody knew.Nobody adopted teenagers.He would be a lifer, an unwanted child turned into an unwanted adult.And on his seventeenth birthday, he bought a gun.None of us watching were worried at all for other people.Despite everything that happened, George was a gentle boy and that was his problem.Nobody could reach him through his overpowering politeness.It took a mothers love to chip away at the boy and all he had was an old photo of a ghost who once loved him.He snuck out when the moon had hit its apex, left all the money he had in a small package with a letter.It read: *Thanks for taking care of me.* And that was it.He didnt sign it, didnt address it to anyone, he wrote it all in a cheap pen and stuffed it inside with twelve-hundred dollars cash.The spot he chose was out of the way.Nobody was nearby to be disturbed.No runners would come this way to be scared.The only selfishness he allowed himself was that it was by a river, a black canvas of glittering moonlight.I was never meant to live, he told himself and us.This is fate.

Some of us nodded with him.Others shook their heads.I stared, my neck stiff, eyes unblinking as he put the gun to his temple.No, I whispered.Dont do it.

Some of us, the more boisterous ones, cheered along, egging the boy to pull the trigger.They had seen a thousand lives and would see a thousand more until all of mankind vanished.A single life in a single point of time meant nothing to them.But for me, this was my first.No, I said and stood from my seat.Please.

The screen flickered to the tremble of his finger.Soon, it would go completely black.He would fulfill his fate.No! I screamed.This isnt how it should go!

The boisterous ones were no longer laughing.The others around me turned away their eyes.At one point in time, they had all been me.They had thought that life mattered, that our pain had meaning.But after a thousand shows of a thousand lives, most of them only slept through the show.I clenched my fists, the words swelling in my lungs.Then, I took the breath to give them life and I prayed, that somehow, I wasnt just a dead man with a loud mouth.Dont pull, I yelled, tears pouring down my cheeks and snot from my nose.Not until you have a chance.Maybe you never will, maybe this will be how it always is, maybe Im wrong about everything, but theres meaning in your pain!I cant tell you if Im right or if Im certain. My voice dropped low.I can only promise.

George closed his eyes.He hadnt heard me, of course he wouldnt.I held my breath.Then, George broke down, the gun still pressed to his head.So cruel, he whispered to nobody.After all this, all I have is a promise.Thats all my fate has to offer.

My eyes went wide.My jaw dropped.And thats enough, I said, my voice too low even for myself to hear.There, George stood, the gun rigid in his hand.And when his tears fell, so too did his gun.---

Happy Thanksgiving./r/jraywang.

It was called *Fuck You* money, the type of money you burn in front of poor people just to see the hope fade from their eyes.It was the type of money you used to hire the most expensive prostitutes in America, tell them to pretend to be bankers, and have them meet for lunch in *Le Bernardin* in the heart of Manhattan.Each thought they were meeting a client, both were told to never break act.I sat at the table next to theirs, twirling a stainless steel pen with the letters *Goldman Sachs* gilded on.The girl, Anna, was the first to arrive.A tight black skirt hugged her figure.The skirt was short, but work-appropriate short.She was the best prostitute *Fuck You* money could buy which meant she was the best in the world.She turned her wrist and checked a silver Rolex.It was a Daytona model.She had certainly done her research.The guy, Brandon, soon followed.He wore a navy blue suit without a single crinkle.I glanced down at his shoes.Brooks Brothers, custom-made.It looked hand-crafted even.A smile touched my lips as he sat down and extended his hand for a handshake.Anna, was it? Brandon said.Thanks for meeting me, my names Brandon, VP at JPMorgan Chase, housing division.

Anna returned him a firm shake.Nice to meet you.Im a VP at Merrill Lynch, risk division.

Look at us, if our bosses found us here.Theyd have our bonuses.

She laughed and took a sip of wine.So, I was told that you had a business proposal for me?

This was it, the reason I had dropped five figures on two prostitutes.Brandon would fumble through banking buzz words and financial pseudo-sciences as I sat back, laughing at his stupidity.Then Anna would follow in their dance of idiocrasy, all the way until they left *La Bernadin*, never to return because they couldnt afford even its dress code.My pen twirled in anticipation.Credit default swaps, Brandon said.Its insurance against bad loans.So if we make a string of bad investments, even when we lose, we make money, just not as much.

Anna furrowed her brow.I work risk at Merrill Lynch, I know how to lower risk.

A giggle tickled my throat.What would a prostitute know about credit default swaps?He probably read the first Wikipedia paragraph and now thought himself an expert.I wondered who would be the bigger idiot, Brandon or Anna?What if we pair that up with thousands of high-risk loans?

Like we already do? Anna asked.But not *individually*. Brandon leaned forward, his voice lowered so I had to strain my ears just to hear his words.We pool them all together and then securitize them into a single asset.Tell me Anna, what happens when you bundle risk?

It drops, Anna said.But those have been around for a while now.Are you proposing that we just keep doing what were doing?

Brandon frowned.It looked like Anna had done more research than him.I pretended to cough to stifle my laughter.It was he who would look the fool!Wait, Anna said, but how about we talk to the ratings agencies.The bigger the pool of assets, the lower the risk.If we get a big enough pool, any sort of shitty asset could have a triple-A rating.

My jaw dropped and I broke character by staring straight at her.The two didnt even notice, they were so buried in their conversation.We can lower it further by having it asset-backed.Like a car loan, Brandon said, his voice rising with his excitement.Like a mortgage! Anna said.We can sell janitors million dollar houses on loans theyll never pay off, pool all those loans together, and then sell them off as a Triple-A asset before they crash and burn.

My fingers trembled, but not with the same excitement I had purchased.They were right.Banks could securitize all these shitty mortgages and their value would rise because their ratings would, even though the risk technically stayed exactly the same.My pen dropped to the napkin in front of me and I wrote a single phrase into it before slipping it in my pocket and leaving.*Sub-prime mortgages.*

The problem with Japans was that they tried to mass produce them.Sure, they got thousands of ninjas, but those guys belonged more in a circus than the battlefield.They could climb walls decently fast?Move around a little silent?Give me a break.The only real difference between them and the standard foot soldier was that they dressed in black onesies.Real ninjas are not so cheap and I promise you, youve never heard of a single one.---

Agent Sarah Romanov had her hands cuffed behind her, her supervisor with his gun twitching on the trigger, pointed directly at her head.And she had thought they had a decent work relationship.I assure you, Agent Romanov, her boss, Agent Kingsley, said.This is to protect you.

Sarah flicked her eyes over to the pitch-black end of his pistol.Somewhere along the six levels of security clearance they went through just to arrive in this interrogation room, her boss had lost his mind.No bodyguard had ever pulled their pistol on their mark claiming to protect them.Im handcuffed, Jeff. It was simple and probably didnt work on a trained CIA operative, but saying peoples first names minimalized their odds of killing you.Do you really need to point a gun at me?

This is standard protocol for this meeting.

Is this because of my last name? Sarah had spent six years as a field agent with no prospects of promotion.She had a good idea why.Performance issues were a good bet, but then she became the best around and nothing changed.Then came the woman angle, but the CIA didnt really cared for the particular spy, only the intel.At last, she came to the conclusion of her nationality.She was Russian.No, her boss said, but a slight inflection at the start of the word gave him away.The door opened and a man in a graphic tank top walked in.He had pink sunglasses and blonde hair with frosted tips.If Sarah had to guess, a frat boy had wandered drunkenly into the wrong building and somehow past the maximum level of US security clearance to arrive here still looking for a spot to piss in.But as soon as he walked in, her bosss finger tensed on the trigger.Agent Romanov, he said.Meet codename Derek.He is a secret more well-guarded than what goes on in Area 51.If you ever wonder why the United States is the military might of the world, youre looking at the reason.

Sarah stared.Medium build.Average height.Healthy weight.There was nothing at all spectacular about this *Codename Derek*.Youre as jumpy as ever, Jeff, Derek said and pulled out the seat across from them.He sat down and plopped his feet on the table between them.Sarah Romanov, youre hotter in person.

The frown on Sarahs lips deepened.Surely, this was a prank.But her bosss cheeks hadnt had any color in them for the past hour now.Derek leaned forward and wagged a finger in front of him.You wanna know why I chose you as my Operator?I like the way you look, he said, chuckling.So, dont let it get to your head.Higher ups begged me to pick someone else, to even give their reports and recommendation a glance.But I found you on Facebook and pointed at you and said thats the one.And here you are.

So, Im here to babysit you? Sarah asked.She had only a single experience as an operator and it wasnt a good one.Her asset had died, quite violently.More or less. He got up, grinning.Steel grinded against steel as his chair scraped the ground.Heard the last one you babysat died.I wont be dying.Though therell be many more opportunities to do so. And he snapped his finger.Jeff Kingsley yelped and his gun clattered onto the ground.He clutched his chest, groaning.It was a heart attack!Sarah got up out her chair to help, but her hands were still cuffed behind her.Cmon, Jeff said, youre my operator.You were supposed to stop me from doing stupid shit like that.To be fair, I injected the kill pill long before you so this ones not entirely your fault.

Sarah looked around, waiting for the paramedics to come bursting through one of the two doors in the interrogation room.Nobody came.Instead, Jeff just rolled across the ground, his face purple as he began choking.She pressed her lips together and knelt down beside him.She slammed her head into his chest and began compressions.It wasnt working.Hey, Derek said, dropping a blue pill onto the ground.Thats the antidote.Have him swallow that and hell be fine in seconds.Only problem is that I only have one and truthfully, this was going to be your antidote.

Mine?

He shrugged.Did I stutter?

Without a second thought, Sarah took the pill between her teeth and fed it to her boss.Swallow, she told him.Her boss followed her instruction and immediately the deep purple faded from his face.He stopped rolling around.At last, even his breath returned with a giant gasp.Sarah whipped around toward Derek, glaring at the man, but he only returned her a small smile.I suppose I was right to choose you, he said.And they told me that I should try thinking for once.

Who the hell are you? she growled.An old man with a few parlor tricks up my sleeve.I look forward to working with you. With a wink, he left.---

I wouldnt call it a war.Extermination maybe.Though Id more aptly describe it as a harvest.By the time they reached our world and penetrated the stratosphere, people sought them out in droves to be harvested.Of course, they knew what that actually meant.Otherwise, they wouldnt have been so eager.Ten years before the *Angels* descended from the sky, they had already sent what some referred to as divine retribution: a virus.Though this virus in particular only targeted women.It spread faster than a wildfire and had a 100% mortality rate.Worse yet, it was completely undetectable.In our desperation, we became animals.We locked our wives, daughters, and mothers deep underground under the constant shine of UV radiation and still they got infected.Within five years, the last woman had died leaving the rest of humanity to slowly die with her.By the time they arrived, we welcomed them with open arms into every one of our major cities.Most bowed their heads and practically begged to be killed.Some fought against them.These were the ones that still remembered the pain of watching their daughters, wives, and mothers die.They couldnt hope to survive, but at least they could enact their own version of divine retribution.Looking back at it now, I know that the *Angels* planned for them.They wanted us to retaliate.Otherwise, where would be the fun?Men charged at them by the millions.Some to die.Some to kill.To the *Angels*, it was all the same.Until we killed the first one.Back when I used to write, I always made sure to name my hero something memorable.If not a strange name, then certainly a strange title.Evan the Incorruptible.Matthew the Harbinger.But in real life, heroes rarely have titles, some dont even have names.That was the case for humanitys last hero because nobody knew who he was.We had only stories.The stories ranged from fantastical to downright fiction, but they always ended the same.We had killed one.The *Angels* mustve been as skeptical as we were because they refused to change their tactics.They kept all our major cities and welcomed anyone to try and take it back.By the fifth dead *Angel*, they learned of their miscalculation.Soon, we learned of it as well.Human beings shared mana and with it, we could do wondrous or terrible things.Magic no longer belonged to the realm of fiction.The elements bent to our will.Lightning struck where we pointed, tornados formed where we stood, the ground swallowed up entire cities as we willed it.Suddenly, men stopped volunteering to be harvested.With their newfound power, they decided to fight back, even if victory had already been stolen from us.They had turned us into animals and then backed us into a corner.Foolish.And that was good enough for us.Looking back, I wonder if we were as foolish as the *Angels*.We, who were content with dying in our little blazes of glory, having accomplished nothing but thinning their ranks by just a bit.It was selfish, but what is there to expect from men who had nothing else to live for?None of us had the vision you had.The vision you have.---

---

Tyler put the pen down, staring at the word *you*.He wondered if his letter would ever find its way to this certain *you*.While humanity had become animals, one man had gone even further.He had been called a monster by both *Angel* and man.Nobody knew which side he fought for, only that he killed both indiscriminately.If Tyler were to write his story, he wouldnt know whether to make this man the villain or the hero.Oh how he wished he couldve written this story, but the only way this story continued was if he died.Beside his letter and pen, sitting at the edge of his wooden table was a silver revolver.The single lightbulb above him glinted off its barrel.A small grin spread across Tylers face.He grabbed the gun, its metal like ice, and pressed it to his temple.Enough humans had died where he could stop the bullet with only his thoughts.The bullet couldnt even hurt him unless he wanted it to.But he did.For the sake of humanity, he needed the bullet to kill him.With his free hand, he picked the pen back up.---

As the last storyteller on Earth, I bestow you the title of Reaper.A monster.A villain.Our last hero.Go forth, Reaper, my death as an offering.With my passing, there will be only four humans left.I have already contacted two of them and they will die with me.The last Im sure you will easily find as your powers will have increased two-fold.By then, your mind will stretch the globe, perhaps even the stars.And when you become the last human alive, I cannot even fathom how powerful you will be.Show our *Angels* how fragile they are in the face of a god.---

Tyler pulled the trigger.---

I have this recurring dream where my alarm clock is blaring and I open my eyes to see my parents still alive in front of me.My father breathes without the oxygen tank that he had carried around with him for the last six years of his life.My mothers withering grey curls are a luscious blonde and her cheeks are once again plump and red.She slides her fingertips down my cheek, smiling.Did you sleep well? she asks.Are you awake?

And right before I respond, I wake.My psychologist says that I lack closure, that I still havent gotten over their deaths.But I disagree.Their deaths werent tragic.Well, of course all deaths are tragic, especially deaths of parents.But my father slipped quietly away into the night on his favorite chair and my mother died holding my hand, surrounded by family who loved her dearly.They each had funerals, wakes, and other remembrances.I had an annual tradition of bringing my grandkids to their grave so I could take another shot of whiskey with my father and give my mother lilies as gold as her hair.Still, my psychologist tells me that a part of me hasnt yet accepted their death.I want to tell him that Im eighty-four years old and only here because three grandkids and two children of my own dont fill the long stretches of silence in my life.They visit, often.But a man still gets lonely.So I dont tell him.I entertain him, nodding my head and humming as he tells me how to live out the rest of my year or so (being optimistic) as best as I can.It might not be their death, he tells me.It might just be death in general.You havent accepted it.

To which, I smile and nod.It is the polite thing to do.The impolite thing would be to burst out laughing at the thirty year old man recently engaged telling an eighty-four year old about embracing death.I accepted my own mortality very long ago.So once again, I entertain him.I barrage him with questions he could never hope to answer and he does his best.It wont hurt, he tells me.Youll find peace.Itll be like gently letting go and slipping away to whatever next world you believe in.Like falling asleep.Isnt that nice?When you close your eyes and you gently fall asleep.

Promise it wont hurt? I ask.He gives me a smile teeming with confidence, as if he knew anything.I promise.

His words play back to me whenever I go to sleep.And every night, I drift further into my dream.It becomes that much more real.The beeping.The parents.The fingertips.It feels more real than reality, as if my whole life had simply been the dream of a nine year old boy still asleep, but unable to wake.Did you sleep well? I hear my mother ask.Are you awake?

I open my eyes, expecting to see my popcorn ceiling and revolving wood fan.Instead, I see my mother, her golden locks curling at her shoulders and her fingertips brushing my cheek.Did you have a nice dream? she asks, tears filling her eyes.I give her a nod and turn toward the alarm clock.Its not an alarm clock, but a heartbeat monitor.My father stands beside it, his eyes constantly shifting from the monitor to me.He crosses his arms and presses his lips into a thin line.It wont hurt, he says, a tremor in his voice.Youll find peace.Like falling asleep.

I give him a nod as well.Or waking up from a long dream, I tell him, my voice barely a whisper.It's all I can  manage.My father covers his mouth and chokes on his breath.His shoulders heave.My mother squeezes my hand and presses her lips against it.Good night, sweet prince," she whispers."Sweet dreams."---

A prank?Barack stared at the letter.If it was a prank, it was a damn good one.The signature was exquisite--looping and elongated, a near mirror image of JFK's real signature.Well, if someone went through this much effort for a simple joke, he might as well entertain them.He looked around to make sure neither his wife or daughter was around.He walked into the living room just in case and dialed the number.It rang once and clicked."Barack."It was John's voice.For a second, Barack thought he was listening to old speeches played in fuzzy, warmly-colored screens."Who is this?"he asked."I'm John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States.The time to serve your nation is now.""No, you're not," Barack said.This was getting less and less funny with every word.It wasn't that funny to begin with."Impersonating a President in any serious attempt is a grave offense.""Look outside."The call cut.Barack peeled back the drapes and peeked through the blinds at a sunny May day.Standing at the end of his driveway, right outside his gate, was John F. Kennedy.A jet black limo sat behind the man.He beckoned Barack and slipped back inside the tinted windows of his car.---

The 44th President of the United States gripped the cool brass doorknob.Already, sweat was accumulating on his hands and neck.This was dumb.He shouldn't go, he knew, but JFK had been a personal hero to him.It was under his leadership that humanity reached the moon, he stood up to Russia at the height of their power, he was a man Obama would've given anything to meet.And now he had the chance.He opened the door and stepped into the sunlight.Secret Service agents watched him go.None tried to stop him.They wouldn't even meet his eyes.The front gate opened like curtains in a stage play, revealing the jet black of JFK's limousine.The car door swung open.Barack licked his arid lips and swallowed what little moisture he had in his mouth.He got in.---

The hum of the car was the only noise between the two Presidents.Obama simply stared.JFK looked exactly like in the photos.The man hadn't aged.He tried scanning John's face for any misplaced flap of skin, any misdrawn shadow, anything to give away the mask.There were none.The car stopped and suddenly, the windows flickered to black.They had been TV screens, projecting fake streets and pedestrians!"Barack Obama," John said turning to face him.From this up close, there was no mistaking who that voice belonged to."Why did you get into this car?"Barack's eyes flitted to the locked doors on either side of him and then faced John directly."You said it was time to serve my nation."Neither man blinked.At last, John spoke, "Well answered Mr. President.But I'm afraid that was a lie."Obama's heart skipped.He clutched his leg, but refused to show weakness in the face of his captor."It is not time to serve America, but humanity as a whole.""What do you mean?""In 1961, I gave a speech called We Choose to go to the Moon.Are you familiar with it?"Barack nodded.Most historians claimed that was the moment that a moon landing was inevitable.With a few choice words, John had mobilized the unstoppable force of human will to reach a land that had always looked down upon them."I gave that speech for a very specific reason.Humanity needed to ascend, but not to a physical place.Initial probes of the moon had returned an element we are unfamiliar with, but this is the element that has kept me young, it grants me certain abilities that I have not shared with the world.""So you did get shot?""I also did die."Barack chewed on his lips.If this was still a prank, it was far more elaborate than anything he'd ever experienced."So what is this element?""One without a name and soon it will be the only element worth mentioning.The Russians know its there.The Chinese probably have some idea.Already, there are factions within both countries, powerful enough to influence their space program.These factions are not in the best interests of humanity.""So what is it that you want from me?""You have proven your devotion to our nation through your eight grueling years of Presidency.Because of its secrecy, we cannot employ our strengths at full capacity, rather, we must do so through single people willing to live and die for the protection of the human race.""Like some sort of super hero?""Not like.Barack Obama, there exists a game far greater than any petty foreign politics.The winner of this game will dictate the future of our race.If you decline my offer, I will drop you off back home and we will never speak again.But if you so choose to accept, you will have the crushing weight of the human race on your shoulders, you will have none of the gratitude or reward.It will be a path through hell itself.So ask not whether you wish to be a hero, but whether you can survive as one."Obama clenched his jaw.He had his wife and two daughters to think of.He had finally retired from the most stressful period of his life.But he had become the President not to leave a legacy, but to fulfill his duty.He nodded."I accept."The doors of the car unlocked and automatically opened.There would be no turning back now.---

"Hey guys? Anthony said, fidgeting onboard an intergalactic spaceship.Im really not comfortable with this.

The tiny yellow creatures around him looked up, some with their one eye, others with two.Their brows furrowed and one of them pushed through the crowd.But Anthony, Melrose, the leader of these creatures, with short stubby limbs and a single eye, said, you have bought us.You own our stars, our land, and all that inhabit it.We exist to serve you.

Ok, sure, but when I get off this ship, do I really need to walk down a staircase made of whatever you guys are called?I meant, cant we just use a normal staircase?

A normal staircase? Melrose chuckled and the rest of the yellow creatures laughed.Oh benevolent master, how else will we *whatever you call us* know that we are merely dirt beneath your feet, to be stepped on and used as you see fit?

Okay, thats also another issue, Anthony said.Also, dont call me Master.I mean, Im black.My people have spent centuries getting away from that.

Would you prefer Our Owner?The Man who has Bought Us?The Wrathful God who we are Mere Toys to?

For a second, Anthony could only stare, his jaw slack.Master is fine, he relented.Now, we must talk about your ceremonies.We have prepared virgins to sacrifice on your alter.

Woah, woah, woah! Anthony waved his hands.No, I do not want that.

Whats wrong with virgins? Melrose asked.A hushed clamor sounded throughout the ship.Are you saying I cant be sacrificed anymore? a voice chimed in.No! Anthony shouted.And virginitys not the problem!I just dont want sacrifices.Hell, Im a virgin!

A round of gasps sounded.But Master, Melrose said.You are already of twenty-six earth years age.Your most prominent years or reproduction are ending.It is times like this when virgin sacrifices are most necessary.

Okay, no.First of all, I still have a few good years left.And secondly, I dont want your virgin sacrifices!

A silence settled in the hull of the ship interrupted only by the creak of metal.Melrose sighed and spoke into the communicator he wore on his wrist.Cancel the ceremony, he said.Our Master has demanded so.

But we spent months preparing for it! a distressed voice said back.Weve made promises.Written checks.Prepared virgins!

Melrose turned, replying in a whisper but still loud enough for Anthony to hear.Well, what do you want me to do about it?Our lives are but playthings to our Master.He doesnt care how much effort we put into these things.We are dirt beneath his feet.

Anthony put up a finger to protest.Well, hold on.Thats not fair. But he couldnt get a single word in.If he so willed it, he could take the stars from us and leave our people shivering until our hearts freeze over and our parents, our friends, and our children all die, Melrose said.We are worth less than the insects he slaps away.

Thats not true either. Anthony raised his finger and his voice, but to no avail.For all of eternity, our crop will belong to him.Our children will be his.No fruit we bear, nor

Stop!Stop!Stop! Anthony stepped up to Melrose.Who the hell do you think I am?My grandfather bought me a star to name when he was drunk.I am *not* some God or some Owner or some Master.In fact, if I was, my first order of business would be to free you all.There, you dont have to call me Master anymore.

His voice echoed throughout the ship.Nobody else spoke.Then, the communicator cackled.Damn it, Melrose, the voice said.Not even our Master wants us!

Melroses single eye teared up.Anthony shook his head.Well no, thats not what I said.

But his words didnt help.Tears burst out of Melroses eye as he fell onto the floor wailing.Im so sorry, he cried in between heaving breaths.I just wanted to make you happy.

Damn it, Melrose!We entrusted this to you! the voice from the communicator shouted.You incompetent bastard.

Okay, Melrose, you're not incompetent.Thats not at all what this is look listen to me its not you, its me.

One by one, the yellow creatures burst into tears, each collapsing onto the floor and wailing.Anthony looked around, his brow raised, mouth agape, and heart racing.Okay! he screamed, shutting everyone up.Okay!Okay!You guys arent free.I wont set you free.

Melrose picked himself up, wiping his eye.Really?And we can still call you Master?

Anthony sighed.Sure, you can call me whatever you want.

And the staircase made of our backs?We can still do that?

Anthony pursed his lips.Sure, that too.

And the virgins?

Oh God damn it!

The kids bullied my daughter because of me.This I already knew.I was the reason Angie came home with timid steps and snuck off to her room without saying hi.I made a fist as the soft patter of her footsteps disappeared down the hall.Kids were cruel and life even crueler.Angie had done nothing to deserve a father like me.I had been born completely blind and with my balding head, my pendulum cane, and sunglasses worn even at night, I made for quite the spectacleone that Angie paid for everyday in her middle-school classroom.Whats wrong with your dad? they would ask her.Why does he walk so funny?

Theres nothing wrong with him! she would snap back and in her frustration, they found weakness.*My* dad doesnt need a cane to walk.*My* dad doesnt wear sunglasses at night.*My* dad isnt blind!

My phone buzzed in rapid secession three times.It was time for work.I pushed myself out of my seat and grabbed my cane.I paused as I passed Angies room.Hey, honey, I tried.Im going off to work now, everything okay today at school?

No response.I couldnt even hear the sound of her breaths.She didnt want to talk.I offered her a smile which she wouldn't be able to see, but I hoped it sounded through my words.I love you Ange, Ill see you in the morning.Sleep tight.

And then I left.A dad who not only got her daughter bullied in school, but ran off to work when her daughter needed him the most.But who else would pay the bills?And was that really a good enough excuse to abandon my little girl?Tears welled up in my useless eyes as I started my cane in its rhythmic pendulum swing.---

I worked security at a small law firm.People would think that being at the front desk would require some sort of sight, but I recognized every voice that came into the building and I could hear peoples lies through the tremble of their breaths.The other lawyers joked that I was like a drug dog for lies.Hey, Aaron said, his footsteps approaching.You get one of these yet?

I glanced up at his voice.Let me see.

He let out a small chuckle and held it toward me.I grabbed it and realized that it was a mug.I felt around its smooth edges and frowned.A mug?I already have one, I said.No, thats a *Worlds Greatest Dad* mug.It shows your ranking in terms of being a good dad.

I felt the edge again.Still nothing.Hey, congrats on being the worlds greatest dad.

What? Aarons voice inflected up.He was on the verge of laughing again.Me?The best?Yeah right.I was lucky to be in the top 50% which isnt that hard considering that some dads are in jail.

I gave Aaron a smile.Congrats on above-average then.

Thanks.Let me see if I can get you one, you got yourself a little girl, dont you?

I nodded.Thanks, I said, but Aaron wasnt the giving type.He was the competitive type and I knew all he wanted was to see someone ranked lower than himself.So lets compare the blind dad to every other dad in the world.Id be lucky to hit average.---

The mug was coming in the mail.An extended holiday weekend meant I had five days before it got here and in that time, I had to hit number one.If people were making fun of Angie because of her dad, then Id just have to prove that her dad was the best.My phone buzzed again, this time twice.It was time to go home.In three hours, Angie would wake up for school and I had to be ready by then.---

Dad?Youre still awake? Angie asked and yawned.Yeah, got home early from work so I slept earlier. I said, which of course, was a lie.I hadnt slept at all.Take a seat, breakfast is almost ready.

I listened for the sizzle and pop of the bacon.It was getting close.What is this?Are we celebrating something?

I always woke up for breakfast with Angie but that was usually a time for toast and conversation.Now I had diced fruit, fluffy pancakes, and an assortment of toast and jelly options splayed out on the table.Nothing in particular, I told her.Hey, after school, why dont we go that new amusement park that opened up?Youve been wanting to go havent you?

Yeah, Angie said, caution in her voice.But last I checked, were still poor.

I shrugged.I found the money.Ill pick you up after school and we can walk to a bus stop together.

Okay, dad. Though she was still wary, no nine-year old girl would pass up a day at the amusement park.I nodded.Its a date. and I could feel her rolling her eyes.She was right though, we *were* still poor.But all that meant was I had to start working the mornings as well as the nights.I could find an hour and two in between to sleep and the rest of the time would be either on the clock or with Angie.There were zoos to see, aquariums to wander, clothes to buy, and through it all, I had to make sure that Angie was having the time of her life.I took a small breath and turned off the stove.Bacons ready.Dig in.

---

Angie held the mug in her lap.It was wrapped in cheap paper.Her dad sat on the couch, watching her, listening for her breaths.The past five days had been strange to say the least.Every day was a new adventure.The first day was at an amusement park where her dad had even let her buy Dipping Dots.She had bought an extra-large serving.The second day was at the zoo where her dad had bought whatever animal feed she had asked for.So she had fed half the animals in the petting zoo.On the third day, he had offered for her to swim with the dolphins.She wanted to, but told him no.Money didn't grow from trees and even if it did, she was too short and him too blind to reach it.That day, he had fallen asleep on the bus, mid-conversation.And in his sleep, his breaths had become labored and his smile dropped.It took so much tugging to wake him up that they almost missed their stop.She had been having the time of her life, but it didnt seem the same with her dad.And though he sled and exclaimed and laughed, she could hear it in the wilt of his words and the small strained breaths he took when he didnt think she was in earshot.After all, she was almost as good a lie detector as he.And he was beyond tired.Whats it say? he asked her.Is it a good number?

Angie swallowed and unwrapped the mug.She had a suspicion what this was about.Her dad always blamed himself for the bullying.He had always thought if only he werent blind, everything would be okay and sometimes, even Angie believed that.But it wasnt true.Her dad wasnt the reason kids were mean.The ceramic felt cool to touch.She looked at the words.Her eyes widened and a swell of air caught in her throat.Dad, she nearly whispered.You made number one!

Her father let loose a single exhausted breath.Good, he muttered.Now the other kids wont be able to make fun of you anymore. His words waned and his eyes closed as he slowly drifted to sleep.Angie held the mug in her hand, rubbing her thumb along its surface.It was completely smooth.She ran off and found a permanent marker and crossed out the *10233*.In its place she wrote *1*.---

Honor and justice were words for politicians.Eraser had always believed in a single driving force to his heroism and that was efficiency.If the name was catchier, he wouldve called himself Factory Man, instead, he took the name Eraser for his powers in wiping villains identities.He took not just their memories, but the memories of all who knew them, rendering them a completely blank slate.Albeit a powerful one.What the world did with those people after he wiped their memories, he couldn't care less.Hot-faced politicians screamed about retribution.Make those bastards pay for what they took ten times over.Stern-voiced suits talked of rehabilitation.People couldnt be punished for a crime they no longer remembered.In the end, America settled on the Reawakening Program, a half-assed rehabilitation center with nightmare conditions.Neither side won and nobody was happy.Though, that was the beauty of democracy.Eraser had his own condo on Lazarus Island, the host of the Reawakening Program.Five days out of the week except for holidays and paid time off, the government stocked him here.Long ago, all the great supervillains had been erased and reawakened.Now, only the small fish remained and there were other heroes far more suited to handling those.The doorbell rang and Eraser sighed.He hadnt even finished his morning coffee yet.Mr.Eraser, came Sarahs voice.She was an intern fresh from college and still treated him with something resembling politeness.We have the first batch ready.

If the name was catchier, he was sure the government would have also call him Factory Man, due to how he was simply a cog in the reawakening process.Sir? she asked when he gave no reply.Would you like me to come back another time?

He flipped through old newspapers.He had requested it to read stories about himself.It was pathetic really, but not as pathetic as the current state of affairs.The worlds greatest hero now working on some memory altering production line.No, no, he said.Ill be ready.

Would you like the profiles?We have a mix of villains today, ranging from unpermitted protests to small theft to even

No, he said, cutting her off.It didnt matter who the villains were.There was a system for vetting them and he trusted in it.It wasnt his job anymore to pass judgment, not for Factory Man.Okay, Sarah said, Should I wait here?

I can find my own way.

Sure. But she stayed at the door.He could hear how hard she was breathing.Sir?

What? he spat.Patience was a virtue for the young.The old didnt have enough time for it.A newspaper clipping slid under the door.Curious, Eraser took it and scanned the headlines.The Great Reset, it read, with a giant picture of a younger him.His brow furrowed, staring at the picture.His cheeks were tighter, his eyes sharper, and his hair a burning red.He didnt remember a time before his beer belly and faded eyes, yet here he was, chiseled.You reset the world, Sarah said.At least, you tried to.You saw that it wasnt right.Violence, hate, war, disease, inequality, the world needed a fresh start.You even reset yourself.

He only half-heard her words, his eyes were too busy flitting across the newspaper article.It called him the Soul Eater for leaving people empty after their battles.His heart skipped and his tongue curled around those words in familiarity.Soul Eater.But a few people escaped, she continued.And with the world a blank slate, they did with it as they pleased.Its even worse than before.Its all wrong.

So you were one of those people that escaped?

The door opened and Sarah stood in front of it, lockpick in hand.She looked like Soul Eater from the newspaper clippings, her eyes just as sharp, and her hair just as bright.Of course, she said.Because I inherited your powers.

After 27 years of sleep, Pennywise the clown arose from its slumber, hungry.Its feet sloshed through the water, the sound of its steps bouncing off the moss-infested stone walls.At the slightest disturbance, the bodies dangling above Pennywise shifted, some spilling three decades worth of bloody decay into the sewer.It inhaled the sour-sweet odor and frowned.None of these children had lasted long enough for a snack, which was fine.In Derry, Maine, children were served fresh.A padded footstep sounded down the sewer and Pennywise froze.It mustve been those kids, back to fulfill their promise.Pennywise faded into the shadows, its claws already out.---

Donatello glanced at April.Her auburn hair spilled down slender shoulders, bobbing as she walked beside him.They were only going to pick up pizza, but he had made sure to wash up beforehand.Chances to go one on one with April didnt come frequently.Unfortunately, this wasnt one of them.Michaelangelo walked at his other side spinning his nun chucks.Im telling you, stuffed crust is the way to go.Have you ever had stuffed crust?Its like a cheese pizza inside of a cheese pizza!

April rolled her eyes and smiled.I guess youve never heard the word restraint?

Of course I have, Michaelangelo said.Master Splinter talks to me about it all the time.

Mikey, the fact that Master Splinter has to keep telling you about it is proof enough that you dont get it, Donatello growled.His orange-masked brother furrowed his brow.Whats up your butt, Donnie?Your staff?

April giggled.Donatello clamped his mouth shut and picked up his pace.The sooner they could be done with this, the better.---

Pennywise tilted its head.Two overgrown turtles and a woman walked through its sewers.Strangely enough, the turtles seemed to be talking to each other.It crept from shadow to shadow, watching this scene unfold.Would you like to float too? it asked under its breath.The orange-masked turtle, the one they called Mikey, stiffened.His nun chucks fell limp at his sides.Guys, he said, turning toward the shadows and squinting his eyes.Of course, he wouldnt see.Shadows containing Pennywise darkened.It nearly burst into laughter, watching a turtle trying to find it in the shadows.Stop slowing us down, the turtle named Donnie huffed and walked ahead of him.If you dont keep up, were leaving you.

Mikey took one last look back before tearing his eyes away from the creeping shadows.Okay, he muttered and continued forward.Three fingers gripped tightly around his nun chucks.Pennywise picked at its teeth.They werent human, yet he could still smell their fears as if they were.Mikey and his fear of squirrelanoids and Donnie and his fear of the girl beside hims rejection.The edge of Pennywises lips curled into a daggers point.Its stomach rumbled.They werent children, but perhaps they could float too.---

The two turtles and April walked in silence.Mikey stopped cracking jokes.Donnie pressed his lips together.April held in a shiver.The only sound between them were the slap of webbed feet and clack of shoessounds that echoed a bit too loudly.With every passing step, though they walked toward the sun, the shadows encroached and the air became a bit more brittle.Nobody mentioned it, nor the sinking feeling in their stomach.It wasnt fear exactly, they were *unsettled*.It felt as if a single voice or jerky movement would tear apart the fragile peace and unleash something upon them.However, though they walked in perfect tempo, never mentioning the darkness, echoes, or coldness, Pennywise only advanced further.The shadows crept.The echoes loudened.And the air grew more still and cold than a corpse.They walked until their footsteps sounded like gunshots and they could no longer even see their own hands in front of their faces.They had passed the sewer exit long ago, but nobody dared to stop walking.It was instinct.But if ignoring the clown was all that took to stop it, IT would never have become the monster it now was.It smiled and took on the form of Aprils worst fears.April stopped walking.She had heard a new sound, something besides their footstepsa flapping in the air, some squeaks.She listened closer and suddenly, the blood drained from her cheeks.Before she could stop herself, a shiver ran up her spine and she screamed.A colony of bats blasted past her, their wings beating upon her body, little teeth nibbling at any exposed skin.April!

She couldnt even tell who screamed it.Everything was drowned out by the bats.Her legs moved on their own, pistoning her forward away from the creatures.Behind her, someone was still calling her name, but it was fading slowly into the distance as she took frantic rights and left, anything to escape the bats.She dashed through Derry, Maines underground labyrinth, leaving behind only her screams.By the time she stopped running, whoever was calling her name could not even reach her in echoes and the bats had disappeared, leaving her engulfed in a deafening silence.And a slight giggle."You can float too."---

I love you, grandpa, my youngest grand-daughter, Sherry, said as she squeezed my hand.I looked up at those emerald green eyes she had gotten from me, at my entire familys as the heart machines slow beats gently faded.Eighty years had passed by in a blink of an eye.When I had been Sherrys age, I had thought myself invincible.Then, at forty, I had worried constantly about death, thinking through sleepless nights about it.But now, I realized that it wasnt so bad.Because if there was ever a scene to immortalize, to be my last, it would be this.Sherry, her bright green eyes glistening with tears, my children and grandchildren all around me as the heart beat monitor lulled me to a gentle and permanent sleep.I love you too, I told them all and I closed my eyes.My eyes opened.How was the trip? a familiar voice asked from beside me.I looked around at the purple moss smothering the rolling hills and the campfire burning in front of me.On my lap was a bong.At last, I remembered.My name had never been Terry, it was Zoroah.Yo, dude, you back with us? Galmroh said, snapping purple fingers in front of my face.I coughed and nodded.Seventeen eyes looked at me from the six people sitting around the campfire.Just as I had wished as fifty-year old Terry, I had gotten my time back.Zoroah was a freshman in high school who finally got invited by the popular kids into a drug-fueled camping adventure.Three boys, three girls, and a lot of *you cant blame me for that, I was high*.Galmroh and Sardak had already paired up, leaving me with Sierrah, the reason I had agreed to come.She now looked at me with sharp blue eyes, a small grin on her lips.Her purple hair had pink streaks across it that dangled off her head and curved into her chest like directions on where to direct your eyes.So Zoroah, how was it?Tell us all the things you did, she asked.Bet you cant beat me, Galmroh said, his chest inflating with pride.My first trip, I enslaved an entire race and forced them to build these stupid triangles.

At least he cant do as bad as Sardaks first trip.He was just a slave.At least he killed someone before his trip ended. Sierrah said.They turned to me again, waiting to hear of all my misdeeds.I was a man named Terry, I muttered.And um I met this girl named Sarah.

Sierrahs smile grew.Sarah, eh?Tell us, what nasty things did you do to this *Sarah*?

Blood rushed to my face, burning it a deep violet.I married her, I said.Galmroh choked on a breath.Sardak burst out laughing.The rest of the girls only furrowed their brows.Yeah. I knew I should stop.I had spent an entire semester trying to join this circle and continuing the Life of Terry was social suicide.But someone had to know of that first kiss with Sarah, the look in her eye staring at our first child together, and the tears in Sherrys eyes when she told me her final goodbye.So I told them, my voice tinged with pride.At the end of my story, I was the only one smiling and my smile stretched from cheek to cheek.Dude, Galmroh said, awe in his voice.That was super lame.

Everybody burst into collective laughter.You did even worse than me on my first trip! Sardak howled.Youre such a wimp!Why are you even here?

I nodded to that one.Yeah, I said, talking to myself.Why am I here? I pushed myself up and walked back toward my spaceship.Laughter followed me the entire way, but I didnt care.I opened the hatch of my spaceship and was just about to get in when I heard, Zoroah!

I turned to find Sierrah.She hunched over, panting, one of the buttons on her blouse undone.Hey, she said, you dont have to run.I mean, your trip was totally lame, but your next onell be better.Plusshe bit her bottom lip and her eyes grew bigyou dont want to be the only virgin in school, do you?

Beneath the starry sky, the silver luminescence of our twin moons, I recognized the glint in her eyes and for a single second, they were a brighter green than any emerald in the world.Sorry, I told the most beautiful girl in my high school and slipped into my spaceship.By the way, the trip wasnt lame.

My engines roared to life and I flew off into the twilight.There were a trillion stars above me and I knew that around one of them, on one planet, was a girl with wild grassy eyes still clutching her grandpas hand.There had to be.Tears filled my eyes as I flew back home.Fiction or not, it was the most real thing I had ever done.---

The first to come were the ones that wanted our fire.They came from a sinkhole in the ocean that our scientists determined to be a mechanism much like a wormhole.Then came the ones that wanted our Earth.They crashed into our planet on a thousand meteorite-like vehicles made of a substance unknown to our universe.And at last, the ones who wanted our air and the ones who wanted our water.They came together from portals that eviscerated our poles.One for the south pole, the other for the north.Each had accomplished feats that had left our scientists baffled.And what was even more troubling--they all resembled humans.We had tried greeting the ones who wanted our fire.We had sent them presents, precious metals, and the welcoming smile of our most expert convoys.They retaliated with a tsunami that wiped out Japan.It was magic, real magic.Something we had previously thought only existed in Hollywood and cartoons.With a few incantations, they could manipulate the water, the earth, even the air that we breathed.But they could not touch fire.So we gave them what they wanted.Napalm, incendiary bombs, hellfire missiles.They wanted our fire so bad?I hoped they like our gifts.Things were desperate but humanity was always at its best when pushed to the edge.Then came the Earth-Takers.At first, we had thought they were here to aid us in the invasion.They seemed enemies to the Fire-Takers and as the old saying goes--*the enemy of my enemy...* But though they were quick to attack each other, they were even quicker to attack us.These new aliens, they wanted our earth.So we gave it to those bastards with steel-tipped bullets, titanium-plated tanks, and a kinetic bombardment of tungsten launched from our satellites.By the times the portals opened in the north and south poles, we already knew what to do.These aliens looked like us but that was where the similarities ended.Everything they had ever wanted they had accomplished through magic.What would've taken humans years to do, they could simply chant and incantation to do so.Thank God we never fell into the folly of magic.They have no idea what it means to move mountains by hand, to  conquer the skies armed only with dirt and stone, to create the greatest weapons in our known universe because we were pushed that far into the corner.Aliens this weak would never snuff out humanity.That I promise you.---

Michelle's pen stopped at the period.The walls around her shook.Bits of dirt crumbled from the ceiling onto her desk.The lights swayed, dancing the shadows around her.She had spent all night on this letter.It was the last one she would ever write and the first aimed at humanity's next generation, the generation of soldiers who had never experienced an alien free Earth."Michelle," came a voice from behind.She turned to see her First General, Paxon, his feet together, shoulders stiff, and arms held to his head in salute.They had started the Resistance together when the governments crumbled and countries fell.At first, it had simply been a way to quell their anger as the other aliens fought for lands rightfully theirs.Blow a hole in a supply chain.Sabotage key communications.Small-scale things.But just as the aliens had done, she had underestimated humanity's grit.A million calls, e-mails, texts flooded her servers and as she strung them all together, the Resistance was born."At ease, General," she said.Paxon lowered his arm."Commander Gladstead, the Earth-Takers are approaching from the North in war balloons.Initial scouts report a tornado of fire dragged behind them."Michelle smiled at her friend."*At ease*," she said."Commander Gladstead?You sound like a grunt."She had always hated that title--commander.In a previous life, she was a pre-school teacher and now, men of the highest positions of power all reported to her.Her friend's shoulder dropped."As you command, Michelle."But this he said with a crescent grin.He knew how power annoyed her.She ignored his smile."How are we holding up against the Fire-Takers?""Still at a stale-mate, but not for long.We're almost out of missiles and our soldiers on the ground are being swallowed by the Earth itself."Michelle nodded.Not good news, but good enough."And at our East and West?""The others are approaching.Their scouts are already here with their armies soon to follow."She chuckled.Victory was always so bittersweet."Paxon," she said, "get out of here.Tell everyone not in combat to do the same."He didn't move.He pressed his lips together and stared at Michelle, humanity's commander, the last bastion of their old world, his friend."Come with me," he said, pleaded."We don't fool magic," Michelle said, a grin parting between her lips."They all came knowing full well that this is a trap and that's because the bait is just too good to pass off.Look at that, Michelle from podunk Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the greatest military asset in the world.Not bad, eh?"Paxon coughed out a chuckle.He took a small breath and gritted his teeth."Commander, it's been an honor.""Don't worry, General, I'll show them just how high the price is for the Resistance Commander.""Yes ma'am."The general straightened up, every one of his muscles stiff.He jabbed his forehead with his hand and returned Michelle the sharpest salute she had ever seen.Without another word, he left."Give 'em hell, General," Michelle whispered to the back of his head.She watched even as he turned the corner and disappeared into the underground corridors of their bunker.Drops of water followed him out.The ground shook again.Another aftershock, another earthquake.Michelle stared at her letter.She nodded and put pen to paper.---

We are about to unleash the deadliest weapon humanity has ever conceived.We call it the hydrogen bomb.It is the combination of every single one of our elemental powers.The blast will consume their armies and leave their bases defenseless and when that happens, I have a single selfish request.Take everything from them.Go through their portals, their sinkholes, their spaceships and show them the true horrors of the war they have bestowed upon us.Long live humanity, the warriors without magic!Michelle Gladstead.Commander of the Resistance.---

In life, Orglord, had flayed his enemies open and put them on display throughout the villages he had pillaged.Men, women, children.None were given mercy.Barbarians warlords didnt discriminate.However, in Suburbs and SUVs, he was Orie, the thirty-year old sales representative currently late for work for the third time this week.I attempt to switch lanes, Orglord said, a quiet tremble to his voice.Unlike his barbarian brethren, his rage was not preceded by rampant roars, but by these soft tremors.Arana, the high priestess of the dark elves and one of the few who dared openly talk against Orglord raised her brow.You know what happened last time you try to change lanes.

But she was handedly ignored.An entire crowd sat around them, staring.Elven magic projected this game throughout the entirety of Almiera.Millions of lives were at stake here.A bad month of B2C sales numbers has been known to result in the pillaging of entire regions by Orglord.Blasted Subaru Impreza, if I had a mightier car, none would dare stuck me in traffic!

He grabbed a die and tossed them onto the table.They clacked against the redwood.Everyone held their breaths.At last, they stopped.A 17.Yes! Orglord shot out of his chair, his fists shaking above his head.I will have gut all those who stand between me and my employee of the month nomination!

The game master, a necromancer hidden by his own conjured shadows, coughed.Is that your move?

No, no. The barbarian warlord lowered himself back into his chair.I switch lanes to the right.

You signal the switch and merge lanes, the necromancer said.Orglord clasped his hands upon his mouth.You successfully merge lanes.

The barbarian and those spectating from his region let out a relieved breath, but the necromancer held up his hand.It was like a spell of silencing.The crowd, the players, the world stopped and stared at that hand.But, due to a traffic accident on the right shoulder of the highway that you are only seeing now, you must now merge back.Only a roll of 18 or higher can get you back into the correct lane without further delay.

Orglord went silent.Those watching from his region began packing their things.The rest of the day fared no better for Orie, the thirty-year-old toilet salesman in Suburbs and SUVs.His boss did not promote him, in fact, he got reprimanded for being late again.Employee of the month went to that bitch Carol who always talked about him behind his back at the water coolers.To top it all off, his wife called, saying that they needed to talk of something important.On his way back from work, Orglord made no rolls.He did not merge lanes.He did not honk his horn.He sat in idle traffic for fifteen minutes and though the necromancer pressed him for actions, he simply waited through it.At last, he arrived home.You step up to the door and open it, the necromancer said.The first thing you see are your wifes suitcase, already packed.She approaches you.

Orglords jaw clenched and he stared at his hands.Tell her, he said, that I understand.I couldnt graduate college, I couldnt give her any of the things Ive promised her, hell, I couldnt even make employee of the month.I promised her the world and this is all I amounted to.Tell her that Im a failure and that this will be last night playing this god damn game!

The necromancer let the barbarians words echo through the room.All around the world, armies mobilized and castles fortified themselves.Your wife brings out another set of suitcases.They are yours.

Orglords eyes snapped up, wide.She tells you that it is your birthday, remember?She says that she never expected you to give her the world, but she never wanted the world anyways.She says that she knows how hard you work and how much you care, even if you refuse to say.She tells you that she loves you and that shed never leave someone as good as you.Thats why she wants to leave together, on a surprise vacation.

Blasted! Orglord slammed his fist into the table and turned away from the game master.Blasted blasted hell! he screamed and brought his palms to his eyes.The players nodded with him.Even the spectators, who a second ago had prepared to move their armies against him, teared up.Orglord, I mean Orie, the necromancer said.What is your response?

Nothing.He kept his back turned as his shoulder shuddered.Orglord?

I will wear your entrails around my neck! he roared back.Do not bother me.Not now.Not yet.This is he chocked on the rest of the words and a wail burst through his lips.This is this This is real, he finally finished.The necromancer nodded back and stayed silent.For centuries Suburbs and SUVs have kept the world safe and today was no exception.With the greatest of magics available, the most powerful of spells and weaponry at their command, the mightiest of the villains all fell to this simple game.Perhaps it was in how mundane it was, perhaps it was in how powerless it forced them to be, or perhaps that this pretend world had somehow become more real than their reality itself.Whatever the case, the armies around the world put down their swords and shields and sat back down in their chairs to finish watching tonights game of Suburbs and SUVs.---
