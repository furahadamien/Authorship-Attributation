"I was many things", I mused to myself, "but I was never a great teacher."Weeks had passed since my revelatory vision - my tribe had left me for dead after trying for more than a day to get any kind of rise out of me.I woke up disoriented and alone, but soon found the telltale smoke of a bonfire, and found the tribe's latest camp.I was welcomed with open arms, but it was obvious I had changed.One doesn't live an entire second life without undergoing some serious mental restructuring after all.Fortunately I was still able to communicate with them, and I told them all about the impossible future I had lived.Buildings hewn from stone, permanent settlements bustling with countless people - wooden boxes with wheels pulled along by horses.All of this technology that would not be created for probably centuries or perhaps even longer; how could one possibly know the current year without any frame of reference?I had one memory more vivid than all - a glorious machine that would help us defend against the rival tribes and even against the mammoths, previously deemed far too powerful a foe to ever engage with.It took weeks teaching my tribesmen to sew fibers together, to sharpen stones into tools to fell trees, and to gather and prepare the necessary materials, but finally I could step back and appreciate the majesty of what must be my species's most powerful invention across all time.Let's just say: if mammoths or enemy tribes look to get within three hundred meters of us, they should expect to be on the receiving end of a 90 kilogram projectile.
