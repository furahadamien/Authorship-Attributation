I sat at the edge of the lakefront in the dark.The howl of the wind across the landscape was the same no matter what now that the Sun was dying in this quadrant.When I first drank the drought that made me invulnerable to sickness and aging I thought I'd find some relief from my own unhappiness at the other edge of eternity.Now a few million years later and departed Terra for Gliese 581c I only cursed my fear of the abyss.Louis Cypher sat next to me at the pier overlooking the water.We both said nothing to each other.There was nothing to say.I never asked him who else had partaken of the draught and what they'd done to reap their souls at the end.I gave up on humanity after trying to save them, being feared by them, then hated.I had doomed myself and them as well a long time ago.Louis' beautiful ethereal face serenely looked into the small pond and smiled at their reflection.The fallen angel looked at me without passion, malice or cruelty, and took my hand as the star in the sky flickered out and true darkness enveloped me.
