The green line has given me purpose since the age of twelve.It led me to choose the right college, right degree, and find the woman of my dreams.After following the green line for 10 years, I will getting married in May next year, I just started medical school, graduated college with a 4.0 gpa, etc.The green line doesn't just point me to where I should go.It points me to the right answers on tests, everything.People think I'm a genius l, but in reality, I dont even have to think.The first 7 or so years were fun, but the complete lack of adversity or stakes has made everything boring.Imagine playing a videogame where you can never lose, or poker where you can see everyone else's hand, but they can't see yours.That's my life as of now.I always assumed the red line was the opposite of the green line.They didnt always point in opposite directions, but the only time I could think of them ever lining up together perfectly was a couple times I was fishing with friends, or at the beach at my local lake growing up.One thing I've noticed though, While the green line doesnt waiver all that much, the red line will sometimes jump to seemingly random points.Life is so boring at this point, I might as well follow it for a day, and see what happens.Can't screw up what I've achieved to this point too much, right?As I follow the red line for a few minutes, I'm lead to a quant little pond with a beautiful garden, and a  couple ducks gently floating along the water.After watching the ducks for a few minutes, they fly off.The red line remains pointing at the pond for a couple more minutes, then jumps to a new direction.Again after following it for two or so minutes, I'm lead to a road.The only notable thing about the road, at this point in time, is that a mother duck is leading her ducklings accross the street.I think I'm beginning to notice a trend.I walk away the red line remains pointing in the direction I left from a few minutes ago.It jumps to a new direction, that I then follow.Sure enough, I am lead to a group of ducks.I do this several more times, and every time, I'm lead to a group of ducks.I guess I was wrong.Green line is the path in life I should follow, red line is fucking ducks.Thanks for reading.I hope you like the take I took on this prompt.
