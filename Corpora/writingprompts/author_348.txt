The smoke from the recently shot gun begins to clear enough for the aftermath of whats just happened to take full effect.Lets go back one day earlier to help shed light on the situation.Jim has just arrived in London, and is already loving it.The sights, the people, he cant get enough.Only problem though is he has no idea how to find his hotel.Excuse me can you help me get to the Crowne Plaza Hotel?

Oui, tu parles le franais?!

No Im sorry I only speak English.

But you were just speaking French.

No Ive never been good at languages, so I definitely dont know any french.

Whatever you say man.What youre going to want to do is-

Our new friend Jim has found himself a companion to aid his travels.He quickly finds his hotel, and turns in for the night.He wakes up gets dressed, and immediately goes to the front desk for suggestions on where to eat.Good morning.

Guten Morgen!Deutsch sprechen?

No sorry just English.

But you were just-

Can you just tell me where I can grab something to eat?

Sure.Walk outside, go 4 blocks over, its a great little place with a red awning.Cant miss it.

Ok thank you.

From here Jim is out the door, and good food is right within his grasp.He follows the directions to a T, and right when he is certain he has reached the end of the directions there is no red awning in sight.Huh thats weird. He mumbles.With no awning in sight he goes to what he believes is the next best thing.The McDonalds right in front of him...
