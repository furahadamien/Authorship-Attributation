"Pay Back"

I literally spent more money earning that $10 than saving it.What's an hour of work at minimum wage worth to me?I did the math.$5.42 in gas there and back.$12.99 for lunch that day.I'm sure I could go more in depth with this, calculating the cost of water to brush my teeth and shower that morning but I'm pretty sure you get my point.Money costs.So not only did he steal $10.00 but he stole everything I put into it.Which brings me to another point; I've been living for money.I've been living to spend more money earning money just to save my money and never use my money.I've been using real life time and physical exertion for practically imaginary numbers in a computer.And he stole ten of my computer numbers and I'm obsessing over it.I'm obsessing because God, really why do I care so much?If the money wasn't being used then why do I care?Because those imaginary numbers literally add up to my entire existence and for less than the cost of a subway sandwich he was able to steal apart of my only claim to validity away.Admittedly I'm feeling unhinged.I have this urge to to spend my money before anyone else can.To take back my life by throwing it away?Yeah.To take back my life by doing whatever the lump I want to do with it.If he can do what he wants to do with it then I can.And what I want to do, is get revenge.
