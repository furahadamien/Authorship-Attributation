I brushed the reserved sign aside, sat down and waited, rehearsing the pitch in my head.And then, as if by some 6th sense of entitlement, he appeared, to challenge this lowly usurper.Hey!That place is reserved for me, dont you see the sign?Move immediately 

I looked him up and down, to get the measure of the man.Physically, he was not imposing, but in his eyes was a steely, cold determination, a determination I would employ for my own ends.Dont just sit there staring at me, you degenerate.What do you want? He demanded.I want to ask if you have given up My voice was monotone, betraying neither fear nor deference.Excuse me? His eyebrows climbed

Have you given up, Mr Hitler?Are you resigned to spend the rest of eternity in this Hell, abandoning the grand ambitions that made your name great? Let me play on his emotions.He paused before answering, briefly looking down to the floor of lava, before his gaze returned to mine.This inferno we cannot escape from.We are bound here by chains of an ethereal nature, and it would be a fools quest to attempt any escape His tone was thoughtful.I agree I said empathetically, We are bound here for eternity, on the whim of a deity who is himself subject to no judicial oversight.No jury, no advocates for our defense, no process of appeal.A travesty of justice, worse than Nuremberg.But, does that mean we give up? 

I could see in his face that I had piqued his interest What are you suggesting, stranger? 

I stood up, picking up the reserved sign, and dropped it to the floor.His eyes followed it with bemusement, no doubt questioning if this was some act of deliberate disrespect.I walked closer to where he stood.We cant leave this place.But why leave?Do you want to go to heaven and sing Kum Ba Ya with a bunch of goody goodies?Lets be honest, all the cool people are down here..

He interjected  Yes, I must say Ive met some interesting characters.But the fact remains that our overseers torment us daily, and scorch us with unremitting heat.Those demons are cruel and unrelenting.Their hatred of us is most irrational and unjustified 

We were now stood eye to eye, so close I could feel his cordite scented breath on my face.I moved my mouth closer to his ear as I whispered the conspiracy 

I think we can change the hierarchy here.I sense discontent among those demons whom Satan relies upon to administer this dominion.I have heard them complain that he spends all his time on earth, whispering into the ears of despots and wayward children, taking great pleasure in watching as the seeds of his troublemaking reap havoc on Gods mortal coil.All the while his minions are relegated to staying here, employed in the drudgery of guard duty and banal tortures.The chains that bind us deceased mortals are indeed ethereal, but the demons are not subject to their constraints.We can take advantage of their discontent, and use them to our own ends.We can establish a Reich, right here in Hell

I can see in his face that I almost have him.I continued.. Bring me your minister Goebbels.We need to formulate a propaganda campaign.I am gathering other useful individuals.Trustworthy men and women, whos skills we will rely upon to effect an uprising.Join me, and you will no longer be resigned to a special reserved spot.This whole dominion will be yours.

It would be mine, in fact, in due time.And when he has outlived his usefulness, I would reserve an even more special place for him in my new polity.I made my way to Mother Theresas quarters, to make her an offer she couldnt refuse.
