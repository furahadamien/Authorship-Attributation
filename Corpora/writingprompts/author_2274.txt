It's amazing how much people change after high school.Chard Burkheart was the star quarterback in high school, the most popular guy in school.Now he works at a gas station with a pot belly and no hair.Dave Spellerman went from bullied nerd to Internet billionaire.All that time spent on a computer really paid off for him.And then there's Rosalyn "Roz" Churchill went from my childhood friend to my high school flame to leader of the criminal underground.That one was definitely a curveball.All I wanted to do was use the ATM.Then some thugs in ski masks bust in and hold me at gunpoint, threatening to shoot me if they didn't open the register.I thought it was all over until the weirdest damn thing happened.See, one of the guys took my wallet and started pocketing all my cash.But when they saw my driver's license, this tough, beefy criminal starts freaking out."It's him!It's the guy on the "No Harm" list!We just held Mike Peterson at gunpoint!"One of the other guys grabbed my wallet, looked inside, and just froze."Oh shit," he said."If Roz finds out, we're fucking dead!"So the thugs just drop my wallet on the ground and pulls some money out of his pocket.He hands it to me and tells me "please don't tell Roz.It was a mistake, honestly!"Then they ran out of there as fast as they could.And I was left standing there as everyone in the bank looked at me, wondering what the hell just happened.No way it could be *that* Roz...right?Roz was one of those girls you only think exist in movies.The girl that comes into your life to turn it upside down, that wild and rebellious girl who gets you to loosen up and enjoy life.She did ever since we were kids and when high school came around I gathered up the courage to ask her out.We dated for a few years but when college rolled around, we realized we were heading separate ways in life.So we broke up, very amicably, and eventually lost touch.It wasn't until I started tracking her down that I realized she had even come back to town.Finding her location was surprisingly easy.I drove into the shadier part of town and started asking around.Whenever I said her name, their faces would get deathly pale.Some just ran away, terrified for their lives.The ones who didn't filled me in.Apparently, Roz is basically the queen of some massive criminal organization with influence all over the world.She's basically the queen of crime.No one even jaywalks without getting her permission.Those who disobeyed her had a habit of disappearing.I couldn't believe it.Roz, some evil mastermind?She was one of the sweetest people on the planet.No way she was some sort of super mafia boss.As I dug deeper, I learned that she apparently put me on a "No Harm" list.Though it wasn't much of a list as I was apparently the only one on it.None of her old friends or even her family made it on the list (which wasn't surprising considering the strained relationship she had with her parents).Roz decreed that anyone who tried to harm me in any way was to be killed.After a little more digging, I finally found what I was looking for- the address of her headquarters.So I here I was, standing outside of some abandoned looking warehouse, about to meet my criminal ex-girlfriend.All in all, not how I expected to spend my Saturday.I walked to the entrance and some big bouncer looking type stopped me."Sir, I'm gonna half to ask you to leave.""Look, I'm here to see Roz, she's an old friend of mine and-" Without warning, the guy started walking towards me.He reached for a gun and cocked it."Sir, no on sees the boss.Now, please leave or I will *make* you leave."I put my hands up defensively and shouted "My name is Mike Peterson!Please, I just want to talk to Roz!"The guy's face looked pale and he backed up immediately."Mike Peter- my apologies sir, I didn't know!"He then got on his knees and started begging."Please, *please* don't tell the boss about this!I wouldn't have done it if I had known who you were!""Uh, sure," I said, wanting to move this along as quickly as possible before it got more awkward.The guy got up and walked back to the door, holding it open for me.He was sweating now, his facing showing pure terror."Please, sir, after you."I steeled myself for what would happen next and walked in.I expected a lot of things.But I didn't expect to see Roz sitting on a golden throne atop a massive pile of money.The guard approached the pile and said "Ma'am, Mike Peterson has come to speak with you."Roz looked like she was in intense thought about something but once she heard my name she turned her attention to me, her face beaming with joy."Mikey!Oh my gosh, it is you!"She slid down the money pile and gave me a massive hug."I missed you so much.You look good.Gosh, what's it been, 10?12 years?""Yeah, just about.I see you've been...busy," I said, motioning to the pile."Oh, yes, it's been a great quarter.But with the upcoming expansions I expect to see some massive improvements.Come on, let's catch up."With that, Roz took my hand and led me to an elevator.She pushed a button and we went down.Turns out the place was way bigger than I thought.Underneath the warehouse were greenhouses for pot, crates full of guns, and tables of people counting stacks of $100 bills.She even had a private jet down here.As we walked through warehouse, Roz told me all about how she ended up here.Selling pot to pay for college, which became a lucrative business.She hired some people to help and the operation grew to selling illegal imports, from Kinder eggs to assault rifles.The money she earned helped pay for high-tech equipment to set up other branches of her "business" all around the world.Plenty of gangs and mafias were against her taking over but they were either taken down or forced to join.In just over a decade, Roz became the criminal mastermind of the world.She even had enough power to influence government policies and could even control the elections.She had become the shadow government ruling the world behind the curtain."So after cementing my authority," Roz continued."I decided I should use my newfound power for good.And because of that, the world is a safer place.Crime is dropping every year, Mike.Sure, some crazy guy starts murdering people every once in a while.We can't control that.But drug trafficking, armed robberies, even political corruption?That we can control.""Wow, Roz.I'll admit, your means are...unorthodox.But you've definitely made the world a better place.""Thank you, Mike," she said, wrapping her arms around my neck."I always regretted losing touch with you.I know we had to go our separate ways but I always wanted to reconnect with you.That's why I came back, why I put you on the list.I wanted to see you again and catch up.Maybe grab a bite to eat.Like the good old days."I stared into her eyes for what seemed like eternity and I felt like I did in high school all over again.Just me and her, nothing else.I missed this feeling.I missed Roz."I'd like that," I said finally."Oh, I almost forgot," she said."I've got another surprise for you."She ushered me over to the other side of the room.All I could think about was how little she changed.She was still that spunky girl, carving her own path to save the world.Sure she did it through organized crime but the at least it was organized.She was still that same kindhearted girl I fell in love with all those years ago.She led me to a dimly lit room at the far end of the basement level.Inside, bound and gagged, were three men.They looked terrified but Roz was practically beaming with pride."So, what do you think?""Roz, who are these people?""These are the no good dirty thugs who held you at gunpoint at the bank.I had my men track them down and bring them here to educate them."With that, Roz whipped out a handgun and loaded a clip.She pointed it at the one on the left and slowly drifted it across all three of them."Now," she said."Which one of you little shits put a gun to my Mikey's head?"Okay, maybe she wasn't the *exact* same kindhearted girl I fell in love with.EDIT: HOLY FUCKING SHIT I FINALLY STRUCK GOLD!Not gonna lie, I half-assed this story at 2AM and was too tried to proofread it.I honestly thought it was kind of meh but I liked the prompt and I already spent so much time on it so I posted anyway.Guess I'm just too hard on myself.To read more of my work, check out my award-winning novel that I've totally started.It's coming out soonish, I promise!EDIT 2: I wanted to write part 2 in the comments below but it got really long.So I created a brand new subreddit to post it right .Come over to r/mikesonofpeter to read the conclusion to this story.Who knows, maybe I'll write more there?
