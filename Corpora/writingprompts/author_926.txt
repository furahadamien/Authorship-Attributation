Steve walks warily down the street

With the brim pulled way down low

Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,

Medicine ready to go


Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this?Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?Into the doorway the devil rips

To the sound of the beat


Another one takes the pill

Another one takes the pill

And another one gone, and another one gone

Another one takes the pill

Hey, I'm gonna get you, too

Another one takes the pill


How do you think I'm going to get along

When you're never gone?You took me for everything that I had

And left me all on my own


Are you happy, are you satisfied?How long can you stand the heat?Into the doorway the devil rips

To the sound of the beat


Another one takes the pill

Another one takes the pill

And another one gone, and another one gone

Another one takes the pill

Hey, I'm gonna get you, too

Another one takes the pill


There are plenty of ways that you can save a man

And keep him outta hell

You can feed him, you can heal him

You can treat him fine and leave him when he's well


But I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you

I'm standing on my own two feet

Into the doorway the bullets rip

Repeating to the sound of the beat oh yeah


Another one takes the pill

Another one takes the pill

And another one gone, and another one gone

Another one takes the pill

Hey, I'm gonna get you, too

Another one takes the pill
