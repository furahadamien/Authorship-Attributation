Sitting on the balcony of my top floor penthouse, overlooking the city, I was starting to enjoy the view as the Sun started coming up over the horizon.The air had become so clear in the cities.The changing colors of the sky as the sun just started to peak over and blind me was beautiful today.Of course, nothing good ever lasts for my morning.Right on schedule, the Amazon merchandise air ship floated slowly by for the morning deliveries, launching its delivery drones, blocking the view entirely.Every single day, right in time with the sunrise, it moved into place and hunkered down in between my Windows and the horizon.I hadn't got to enjoy one in at least six years.I got up and went inside.Frustrated for yet another day, I grabbed a cigarette from the pack and lit it.A buzzing alarm sound filled my home.As I finished my drag of tasty hot smoke, I turned around and peered out of the glass at the ship.The advertisement on the side of the read, "Quit smoking, or else Amazon won't deliver to your house!"I got a slight chuckle today."That would be rather interesting."I thoight  "Can they do that?"I quickly dismissed it."No way..."

I took another breath through my cigarette and the alarm sounded again.As I stood there watching out the Windows, the sign changed to, "Please quit, so that we are all safe!"Again, I rolled my eyes."These were excellent this morning."I chuckled internally, while starting to feel a bit overwhelmed.As anxiety flowed through me, I stuck my head out of the outside doorway and hollered, as if someone was there to hear me, "There are always ways around laws if you have enough money!"I immediately felt a relief of personal vindication as I slammed the door closed.I took another puff as another loud buzzing alarm filled my home.Money is also the reason I'm one of, if not the only, smoker left on the planet.People stopped years ago when the Yellow Vested Throat Fungus infected the worlds tobacco.When smoking didn't kill you, but killed those around you, everyone in the world started to notice.We lost almost every world leader in less than 6 months.Governments started to fall apart everywhere.Amazingly enough, Amazon had its automated air delivery system in place and they took over.While people were dying and fear had enveloped the world, Amazon deliveries carried on autonomously and weren't affected.They were able to get help everywhere around the world as soon as it became available.Speaking of Amazon, I noticed a new ad appear on the airship as it headed out of sight.This time, it was for my neighbors.It read, "Please keep your penthouse neighbor locked in his home until we tell you it is safe.You are doing the world a great service!"I snapped!"Fuck them!Fuck them all!I grow my own tobacco and it's completely safe!"I yelled loudly, to the point where my voice crackled.I lifted the cigarette to my lips and took a deep, long drag this time."Buzzz" went the alarm again.I barely even notice it anymore.When laws started to be put in place, things got really interesting.Every tobacco manufacturer on the planet either shut down, or was destroyed by angry mobs, one by one.Today, it's illegal and downright dangerous to even have tobacco.Amazon took over the world and merged with Alphabet, FedEx, UPS and then actual world Governments joined together with Amazon to run the planet.Countries still exist for local Government and budgets, but the world is now run as one unit.One people.One planet.I puffed one more drag from my cigarette.A buzz echoed through my house and my wall displayed my $10,000 fine again."Good luck world!"I said aloud."I invented Microsoft.I'll smoke if I damned well please.I don't need any of you.I made this world of Amazon possible!Because of me, I saved all of you!"Out of breath, I fell to my knees and started sobbing.My cigarette hit the floor as the force of my fall knocked it from my fingers.It rolled along the hardwood floor and to the edge of a rug.Nobody was there to hear me.My entire family had been dead for many years, due to the fungus.BUZZZZZZ
