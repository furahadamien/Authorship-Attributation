**7 MONTHS AGO**

Steve watched the end of civilization descend upon him at 20 times the speed of sound.A dozen spindles of light seemed to blossom from a single point in the night sky before streaking down toward the city.*So this is it.This is how we all die.*

The first of the MIRVs detonated several miles away, but even from that distance the light was unbearable.Steve felt a rising wave of heat rush across his skin.*Jesus... Buddha... Satan...somebody!* 

There was another flash, this time much closer.And with that, Steve was gone.----

**PRESENT DAY**

Dust billowed into the air behind an armored pickup truck as it sped westward through the desert, chasing the last rays of the setting sun.Jesus had the wheel in a white-knuckled deathgrip.The fuel gauge had stopped working weeks ago, but he knew there wasn't enough to make it.The steel plates Steve had welded to the frame were great at stopping small arms fire, but they didn't help the aging vehicle's already poor gas mileage."... Sid, lay down some fuckin' fire!"Siddhartha's reply came a moment later as the M2 roared, tracer rounds piercing the cloud of dust behind them.Sparks and tracers ricocheting in the darkness announced that the Buddha's last burst had struck home.Leaving a trail of burning fuel, the closest of the pursuing trucks veered to the right and began tumbling violently."To live is to suffer, motherfucker!"The Buddha's maniacal laughter was interrupted by ever-longer bursts of automatic fire.Steve and Jesus exchanged a knowing glance.Neither were completely comfortable with their "enlightened" gunner's newfound bloodlust."Jesus Christ, that guy's crazy."Steve said."He's going to melt the goddamn barrel at this rate."Jesus kept his eyes forward, pretending not to hear his human compatriot over the Buddha's enthusiastic use of the .50 cal.He was slightly annoyed at having his name taken in vain, but it was their fuel situation that truly had him worried.He might be able to turn water into diesel, but there was no more water to spare.He made a hard turn, leaving the scorched dirt for the ruins of an interstate highway.Steve held his breath as the engine sputtered, then began running smoothly again."We're not gonna make it to St.Louis."Steve said."Lucy, you got any tricks up your sleeve?"Satan sat calmly in the rear cab, eyes closed, unfazed by the banter and gunfire.Her concentration was elsewhere.She felt two more of their pursuers' souls pass into Hell, but that, too, was a distraction.There were many more souls in the trucks behind them, and at least one divine being in the air above.This situation might demand that she reveal skills she would have preferred to keep hidden, but there was no alternative.Satan spoke for the first time in the firefight."Floor it till we run out of gas.Put as much distance between us and those trucks as you can.They've got eyes above."Jesus smiled."I think we've got some things in the back for that."The truck sped down the deserted highway, running on fumes and desperation.Steve looked at the heavier weapons arrayed in the truck bed, half-buried under a pile of the Buddha's spent brass.A few rocket propelled grenades, and an old anti-aircraft missile.He wasn't looking forward to using those things.Back in Atlanta, Jesus had helped Dionysus restock on wine in exchange for several of the weapons, but they'd not had cause to use them.Yet.The engine sputtered a final time, then died.In the irradiated wasteland behind them, shrouded by ash and concealed in darkness, Quetzalcoatl circled.----

It had been days since Quetzalcoatl had gorged himself on the still-beating heart of a mortal being, and now his prey was cornered.He screeched with elation and dove from the sky toward his quarry.Months ago, he would have been content to have his followers bring him the offering.But in his hunger, Quetzalcoatl had grown impatient.He saw the stranded truck and imagined the beating of the mortal's heart on his tongue.All of the creatures below could no doubt see him by now, but creatures of the earth were of no concern to a winged serpent.The conjured flames burned impossibly bright and moved as if of their own volition, but they paid the feathered god no heed, instead seeming content keep his mortal followers at bay.*Foolish creatures.*

Blinded by his own hunger and Satan's flames, Quetzalcoatl did not notice the the anti-aircraft missile streaking toward him until it was too late.Not until he was knocked from the sky with a force he had never experienced before.Screaming in rage, he clawed at the air and flapped his broken wings as the ground drew ever closer.The fallen god had no time to register the impact before Satan's flames consumed him.
