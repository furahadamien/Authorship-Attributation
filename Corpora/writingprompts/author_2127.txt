You stay there struck by surprise .You think the girl is gonna disappear in any moment she pierces through your eyes with her look and asks "I know this is stupid but, are you real?"while keeping that analyzing look over you.You tought to yourself 'Of course I am real, I should be the one asking you that' 

Her expression changed to surprise, a smile shines on her and says "I'm not crazy!Even since I came here the thoughts - your thoughts were getting stronger and louder!Christ you don't stop thinking for a second, you drive me nuts!"You couldn't speak, one, because she doesn't stop talking and two because you can't believe this, she's just a part of your imagination, did you forgot to take your pills?Some days pass like a second and you forget to take your pills.So you do the best thing you can't without looking like your usual crazy and began walking away."hey, what are you doing, stop right now!"She yells, you began to notice people at looking at her, or is it you who's yelling?Her loud demands drill in your head, she has the same voice that you've heard for years until recently that have finally stopped."Of courses I have the same voice as before, what would it change, please just -" 

Her voice was muted by wheels breaking with force and stopping right at your side.Two big gorillas in suits step outside, staring at you, a sooth voice comed from inside."Hello Renzo, I know this is a but frightening, but don't worry, come inside and we will help you get this voices out of your head" 

None of them were paying attention to the yelling girl next to you, or maybe she'd just didn't exist and indeed wasn't just the voices.But it was an awful coincidence.So you grabbed the girl's hand and ran away.You remmebered the awful days at the hospital and you didn't want to go there again with all that crazy people."haha, nice decision uhmm... Renzo!That is your name, isn't it?I am Natalie, just for your interest" 

" ok Natalie, you ran as fast as you can and don't let yourself get caught... Or just me" Renzo muttered the last words.Natalie kept talking somehow, because you were getting out of breath and could even tell her to shut up, the adrenaline filled your body while thinking where you could go where those gorilas couldn't reach you
