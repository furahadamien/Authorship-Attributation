Im on day 25 of ignoring the lines.I'm in my office, which is also my home, which is also the penthouse in my main building.By "my", I don't mean association, legal possession, or that I wrote my name on the front; I mean unbridled dominance.I've been searching for years to find a single person who doesn't yet answer to me in one way or another.Boring.*When I was twelve or thirteen, the green line first appeared.Following this line meant serendipity manifested as wealth, prestige, and undiluted, infinite good luck.That line became my religion.*


Day 32

New experiences no longer exist for me.I've been a world traveler, artist, aristocrat, bum, movie star, TV star, sports star, author, playboy, fuck machine, husband, father, philanthropist, crime boss, astronaut, priest, soldier, anything and everything.All I have to do is follow the green line, and avoid the red line.*Two lines: one green and one red.I tried following the red line only once.I was fourteen, and curious, and impulsive.I ran into a gang of skinheads and was subjected to the cruelest of beatings.They would have killed me, but my sister intervened.The red line would have had me die by her side.The green line led me to crawl away and get within eyesight of a patrol car.Im so sorry.* 

Day 40

Why do I feel powerless?I have no master, but am I slave to this line?Its premonitions cut through chaos theory to dictate the path to happiness.I can ignore the lines, as I am doing right now, but they remain.They never leave.Every second I don't follow the green line, I must live with that decision: that my absolute path to happiness is not being followed.*After the hospital, my green line brought revenge.The skinheads paid with life and limb.Standing over the gang leaders corpse, my red line pointed at a pay phone, no doubt to turn myself in for my crime.I decided these lines were sentient at that moment; Right then, they were telling me a joke with that ridiculous suggestion, and it was mildly amusing.*

Day 47

Why am I thinking about that day again?Now I'm staring again at that red line, wondering what stupid plan it's telling me by pointing at my gun safe.The green line points to my running shoes.The lines are telling me a joke again: Go for a run, clear my head, everything will be ok. That's fucking hilarious, because the past thousand runs haven't helped.What is so forbidding about opening my gun safe?*I stopped asking why I could see the lines after my sister died.All that mattered was: green good, red bad.*

Day 48

I'm actually considering that red line.For the ten thousandth time I remember that my beautiful world is devoid of conflict and negative experience.Whatever I want, I get.Why would I follow the red line?Am I finally going insane?*After getting famous, I bought the guns for self defense.They came into use in many non-defensive situations, but always without recrimination.Follow the green line, get away with it.Simple.*

Day 49

I'm a prisoner.This penthouse and the building under it and the city surrounding it and the world outside it are my prison.I follow that green line, I stay in this prison.I follow the red line.*I was even in the army, just for the experience.Disobeying orders on the battlefield is frowned upon but I outlived my entire platoon, green line style.I lost count of how many strangers I killed; how many strangers I saved.I have a box of medals somewhere.Desertion is also frowned upon but the green line showed me who to bribe, threaten, or kill for an honorable discharge.*

Day 50

What's more important: happiness or free will?Is this even happiness anymore?*I got rich very young, and money lost all meaning.I got to go on dates with my crush and dumped her for boring me.I landed my dream job and quit after a week.I got recognized by so many people I'd never met and I wanted nothing to do with them.*

Day 51

Happiness or free will?*You shouldn't have even been there.I was taking you to a movie with that money I'd won.If I'd gone alone *

Day 52

The answer is free will.There are 7 people I'm about to shoot in my penthouse.I've summoned them up here.Some of them are friends.Some are begging for their lives.I'm not particularly happy that I'll do it, but it's my choice.Mine....The red line draws a circle around me as I pull the trigger over and over.The green line points to the emergency exit staircase, and its getting brighter....I shoot the police officer that steps out of my elevator....The green line is spinning around, unstable like a compass needle that can't find north.Erratic; Urgent.The red circle around me pulses a warm glow....Is this free will?Is this what I've been missing?The green line almost blinds me as it points at my TV remote.Well, that's new.I haven't turned on my TV in a long time and never because the line said so.Hey, look.I'm on TV.And there's my building, a live image of SWAT and FBI establishing a perimeter.I suppose I could order my mercenaries to defend the building.The green line seems to think me picking up that red phone on my desk is pretty important right now.*Why did I walk up to that gang?I saw the danger, but I kept going.I let my sister pay the price.I wanted to trade my life for hers.Where's the path that brings her back?If I'd kept following the red line when I didn't have that money, would she have been there?Would anyone have gotten hurt besides me?*

Look at me, murdering all these people and having the nerve to mourn my dead sister.How about now?Am I crazy yet?Is this boredom, grief, or insanity?Should I fight this and live my life?The red line does something I've seen it do many times before: encouraging me to jump right out that window of my penthouse.Another joke, of course.The green line can't decide what it wants me to do anymore.Emergency exit.phone out the window?What?The green line is pointing out the window, exactly the same as the red line.So thats it, then.I wasted my time and ignored my escapes and now my best path and worst path are one and the same: out that goddamn window.The red phone rings.It's a police negotiator demanding my surrender.I politely decline.I'm the guy who can't even find happiness with fate bending to my will--Prison won't fix that.I hang up and shoot out the window.With no ceremony, I drop my gun and sprint toward the red and green lines, and the amazing plunge that awaits.No, I'm not crazy; I've just run out of things to do.
