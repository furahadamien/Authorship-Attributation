All those movies are wrong, only parts of them are accurate.Elf is dead wrong.The Santa Clause says I'm in control.That animated one about Jack Frost is correct about the warrior part, but I have no magic alone, not even with belief.The elves call me Santa, their word for Slave.Claus means Warrior.In total, I am their Warrior Slave.My mission isn't to bring joy and presents.I exist only to kill demons.The priests that decided to make a Pagan Holiday into the day they celebrated Christ's birth were idiots.Doing that warped reality, causing demons to flood the world on the 25th of December.I'm coming up to the Hellpit.The mortals call it New York, my elven masters call it "The Modern Stonehenge".I land down in the street.It's silent, even the normally open stores are closed and dark.Macy's, the greatest spawning pit in the world.It's coming, bigger than ever.I am Santa Claus, Demon Slayer
