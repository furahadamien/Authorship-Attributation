The cold air tickled my feet, sending shivers down my spine.It was a cold winter day, and the snow slowly trickled from the sky.My clammy cold fingers unlocked the phone, my feet desperately trying to warm up under the thick comforter.If I had a choice, Id have a fireplace burning in the corner of the room, spreading tendrils of warmth throughout the room as the orange dancer

Opening up Reddit, I wandered over to r/WritingPrompts.The light emanating from the phone formed the words, \[WP\] you are yourself, on Christmas Day, reading this on reddit, you are told that you are loved and accepted for who you are, and to have a happy holiday season, and a great new year!

Something soft bubbled in my chest, slowly making its way out of my mouth.I chuckled softly at the thought, these holes in my eyes slowly sucking all the emotion from my mind.It was wretched, terrible.I tongued my slightly yellow teeth, that familiar burning sensation at the back of my throat.I smelled blood, knowing that my torn esophagus wasnt gonna heal for the next few days.Reaching out for the window, my skin crawled as my fingers froze.A sigh left my lips.Too good to be true.Wasnt gonna change a bit.Maybe today would be the day that I wouldnt be doubled over the tub with water trying to carry bits of food away.Maybe.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This is late as all hell, but better late than inaccessible.
