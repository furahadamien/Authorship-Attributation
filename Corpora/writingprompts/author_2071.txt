DT looked at his feed and sighed.Not enough.Still not enough.He had tried everything.Creating mayhem, spurring people on.The bipeds were out there killing each other and it still wasn't enough.He passed a tired hand over his orange face (and wasn't that one a joke, he'd been really worried they'd pick up on his unusual skin tone but the bipeds were really, almost adorably stupid) and pulled off his orange gloves to phase into the communicator.A familiar face popped up on screen, one that millions hated...
'Requesting status update agent K'

' All ongoing projects are being maintained.The bipeds are however reproducing beyond control.It is, quite frankly alarming.''Hang on, we've got agent P calling in with an update.'A cheerful voice popped up :

'Hey guys!How's it going??Been hearing a lot about your most recent accomplishments agent DT!I sense a promotion..!'DT secretly smiled to himself while keeping a stern face.His work was after all, far from over...

'These damn bipeds, constantly breeding beyond control and without any consideration for anyone else!'K muttered.'Now, now, you know they don't know any better.I mean, you'd think they would have caught on to what we're up to, and still, still, they keep asking for more.You can't expect a subpar species to have an understanding that's so sophisticated, can you?''I suppose you're right, D - but I have to say, I really do miss the family you know?I wish they'd just hurry up and die really.I thought we'd hit on a winning formula with all the vote modifications and obvious lying, but clearly, it'll take some more time.'' I know P, I know.I miss home and the family too.Well, what can you do?The life of billions is at stake here after all.. and I feel that the day I can give the order for the nukes is almost here.We'll be home soon.'The three agents looked at each other, and silently acknowledged the challenging days ahead.With a nod, K logged off, leaving P and DT to chat.'You know D, it's not as straightforward as they told us it would be.''I know P, I know.'With a worried expression, P sighed deeply and logged off.D refreshed the feed in front of him, sighing deeply.Someone knocked at the door.'Everything alright, Mr President?''Yes, yes it is.'Sorry, that was written in a hurry but oh well
