"Afternoon Steve!"a gruff voice croaked."Oh, Hey Bill" Steve was on auto pilot.He had been hearing some crazy stuff in the office and couldn't focus very well."So.... have you looked at your mug yet?"Bill flashed a quick smile, his entire face was red and shiny, his mustache a common intruder to his lips looked like a used workshop broom."Nah, not yet it's at home" Steve was trying to hide his disdain, somehow out of EVERYONE IN THE WORLD his Asshole Manager gets the #1!?He Doesn't even have kids!"Ya'know, I'm glad I never had kids, look at everyone freaking out!This is like Christmas!Maybe we can go home early, you know Boss has already left, aren't you a little curious what you're number is?"Bill chortled."well, I know what number I'm not..." Steve trailed off and let the thought of maybe #2 might be a decent constellation prize."you're right, Bill, let's go."Steve pulled up into his driveway, and couldn't contain his curiosity and booked it for the cupboard.Clink!Clank!Everything was getting shifted... where was it?It had been here this morning when he left!Why didn't he grab that mug instead?"what are you looking for honey?Please keep it down, i just put Allison down!"Steve's wife Marissa was standing in the doorway, and it looked like she had something in her hand.The mug?"Oh, uh sorry.There was a lot of talk at work about Dad mugs and I wanted to see if something was on it."Steve tried to keep his curiosity at bay."Do you have it in your hands?"Steve's brow started to furrow as his wife's body language wasn't looking good."Yeah, uh... this is it.I think it broke?I'm...I'm not sure whats wrong with it.. its like.. it partially changed... but the numb-"
"The number?"Steve interrupted, he made a grab for the mug and she obliged.Steve's eyes were as big as saucers, the number...."Is Blank?"Steve was confused, He has  a Wife AND a daughter?How does this get fixed?What's his number??"I guess this one's a du-" Steve stopped in his tracks
Why was his boss in his hallway..talking to his wife, with...a mug?Steve walked over to the hallway, and stood next to his wife."Mr. Cameron, what can I do for you?Why are you speaking to my wife?"Steve was getting more worried by the second."you.. weren't supposed to be home..yet..." his wife spoke softly
"wait.WHAT?"Steve's mind was reeling THIS is why his boss got #1 Dad... and  OH MY GOD!His Daughter...Even his daughter...He was free._____________________________________________________
