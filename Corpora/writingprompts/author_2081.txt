Pass me the blots, will you said Hermione.Her breath reeked, her words were slurred, and she could do with perhaps about fifteen hours worth of beauty sleep.Harry stumbled from his desk and proved that he was barely able to navigate his way too her, he grabbed the bedpost for support with one hand, and with the other very carefully aimed the small square of paper into her outstretched hand.Hermione examined the magic paper square at length, and yet at the same time thought about nothing in particular while looking at it.What did you call it she asked, finally.Pollyjuice potion he replied.Hermione placed the strip of LSD on her tongue and swallowed, the hit would come any second, and soon she would assume the form of one of the Slitherine girls, or some such nonsense, but she had to be in the right frame of mind before she could direct the groups mission, whatever it was.Harry made his way back to his desk and did another line.Or at least he would have, if he had not placed the fatter end of his wand inside his nose while awkwardly poking some cocaine with the thinner end.Ron had been quietly observing the behaviour of the other two for the past couple of hours behind his absurdly massive bong, and had correctly deduced that this was the greatest, most extravagant bender that the gang had ever been on.Harry and Hermione would soon pass out into a gurgling mess, he was quite sure of it, so he decided to speak up.Lets go do something! He said, a little too loudly.Weve been in here all night, we need to spread the love

nuh-uh said Harry Ive had bad times

Guys, look at this wizard shit piped Hermione, she flumped from her bed and went over to the window, and started giggling to herself before examining the glass.Wasnt it just beautiful how the rain ran down it?She put her hand up to it, it felt like how a gentle force field would look like, she surmised, retardedly.After about five minutes of her pontificating, but at the same time not really thinking about much at all, Hermione spied a raggedy old man running down the corridor on the other side of the dorm.He had a fly swatter and was trying fervently to beat the living daylights out of something in the air.It was Dumbledore!Guys look!Come here She exclaimed The old fart cast a Wingardium Leviosa spell on his slipper again!Hes chasing it down the corridor, we need to help!Im pretty sure Malfoy is just tugging it on a piece of string again retorted Ron leave him to it 

Fuck you Ron Harry sputtered and jittered from his seat.He rose from his chair too quickly, as if he hadnt had the keen sense to control his own body.The chair fell backwards and smacked the ground hard, the following thwack startled Harry and he kicked the chair over and over again in response.fuck you, fuck you, fuck you! then he cried because his parents were dead.Hermione and Ron were all too familiar with this behaviour.Harry had taken a little too much magic potion and Ron rushed to his side to comfort him.Its ok hero, come on, put your hand round my shoulder, Ive got you

Harry wasnt having any of it, he curled up into a little ball at the end of his bed, Ron couldnt quite see, but he could hear Harry squirming and he was quite certain he was trying to crawl underneath his bed again.For fucks sake Harry!Just because its claustrophobic down there doesnt mean itll be like Pivot Drive! 

He could just about hear Harry blubber I liked it under the stairs

Fine!Fuck you then!Im going to help Dumbledore, if youre going to be such an arsehole and soon, Ron was gone.
