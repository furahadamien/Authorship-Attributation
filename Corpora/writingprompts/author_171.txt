*Bzzt, bzzt!*

I wake startled in a dark room, not sure of where I am.*Bzzt, bzzt!*

The confusion wears off as the light from my phones screen illuminates the room, I must have nodded off while at work.Reaching for my phone there's a sudden flash of blinding light that sends me reeling, almost falling out of my chair trying to shield my eyes from the light.Dammit, must have knocked the mouse to my computer.Blindly I reach for the monitor and turn it off, thrown back into the darkness.*Bzzt, bzzt!*

My phone now in my hand vibrates again.Squinting form the light I read "ALERT!DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON!"written in red text across my screen along with some government looking seal."What the hell" I think as I tap it away.A notification of 23 new unread messages takes its place.I never get this many messages unless something wierd is going on at work.Opening the first message from an unknown number, it reads "OMG!Take a look at the moon, it's amazing!".I cycle through a couple more of the messages and they all want me to go out and look at the moon.*Bzzt, bzzt!*

Another message comes through reading the same, well this is weird.I get up to leave my room to go looking for anyone pulling an all nighter.The office corridors are empty but what did I really expect, its the beginning of the long weekend, no one would have stayed past knock off.Back in my room I collect my things and prepare to leave.*Bzzt, bzzt!*

Another one.OK before I leave I'm just going to see if this is happening to other people.I'm blinded once again by the monitors light as I turn it back on again and struggle to to get on the internet.Service not found.Huh, the office internet never drops out.Just then the room gets pitch black as the monitor light goes out and the electric hum that usually emanates the silence disappears.A blackout?Well that would explain it, I should really be getting home now anyway.Picking up my bag I begin to leave the office passing by the kitchen and outdoor balcony when a shadowy figure catches my eye.*Bzzt, bzzt!*

I glance down at my phone."Turn off the light".Yeh, alright this must be some weird prank, whatever.I return to glance at the figure.It's not just 1 person, it looks like my entire floor of colleagues is standing outside.They must be having drinks before going out to town.Standing there I notice their behavior is odd, none of them are moving.In-fact all of them seem to be looking up.*Bzzt, bzzt!*

It's probably just another random message....wait maybe...I cautiously approach the outside balcony taking heed to shield my eyes from the moon.I feel stupid for doing it but hey, better to be cautious right?I open the sliding door expecting to hear the murmur of people talking but there's nothing, complete silence.I begin moving towards one of the people."Anthony" I call out questioningly.***BANG!***

I jump and feel my heart begin to race.Turning, I realize it was just the sliding door closing."God I'm an idiot" I think "scared of a damn door".I'd hoped that telling myself that would calm me down but in the silence all I can hear is my heart beat racing.I continue towards Anthony, hand still shielding my eyes from the moon high in the sky.I can see his face now, mouth open, staring at the sky.His arm outstretched in-front of him holding his phone as if taking a picture of the moon."Anthony, you ok?"I ask as I wave my hand in-front of his face.He doesn't flinch.I look around at the others, they are all still standing like statues looking up at the sky with their arms outstretched, holding their phone.Returning my attention to Anthony in-front of me I notice his eyes begin to go pitch black, the reflection of the moons light disappearing from his eyes.The moons light begins to fade, must be a cloud.I'm still too frightened to look up.*Bzzt, bzzt!*

Again I jump.My heart feels like its about to burst out of my chest.I quickly glance at all the people around me as I pull out my phone, they're all still like statues.I squint at the screen, my eyes slowly adjusting."They're attracted to the light.Turn off your lights!"I look up from my screen......They are all looking at me with a small dot of light in their eyes.
