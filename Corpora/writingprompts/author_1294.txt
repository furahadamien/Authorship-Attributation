You could call it luck.This vast, endless place where space didn't seem to matter.Time might, but I couldn't determine any passing of it, couldn't feel it.The high, vaulted walls stretching upwards for what looked like a hundred feet above me, ringed by floor upon floor of shelves.And on each shelf was a modestly bound book in any variety of colours.Always singular, save perhaps some trim or other minor affectation adorning the cover.At first I found it a little disorienting.Then awe-inspiring.But what I saw was the truth.Each and every volume was a different life.A different person that had lived or was living was here.There was a sound that happened every few seconds.A furious scribbling noise that I thought was the books writing themselves.I was wrong, as I learned an untold time later.The books appeared in a burst of that noise.Taking one from its new spot, I found it already filled in.No free will.I spent what I assumed was hours at the least, time measured only by the development of a mild peckish feeling, trying to find some kind of order.Eventually I stumbled on Genghis Khan, Caesar, Caligula.Men of great import in the development of history.Curious, I explored further, and found Bacon, Francis.Heading in the opposite direction, I found no Shakespeare, William in this same grouping, which I had deemed "People of Significance."It gave me a sort of twisted pleasure.I had never been a fan of the Bard.But I didn't want to dwell on it much longer.I went about until I found more mundane people, those who were "People of Insignificance."Unlike the equally modest Significant books, these didn't have subtitles outlining their person (Genghis Khan came to mind again).Drifting among the shelves of the Insignificant in search of my own biography, I find it some time later.I suppose there's some sort of narcissism not even checking anyone else's biography first, but I shrug it off.Opening it to the front, there's a summary.Name, life span, a brief description of the person, their looks, and their personality.Well, in this case mine, I assumed others would have the same information if my own was like that.Not everything in there surprised me.Not everything I read through was pleasant.There were sections based on childhood, teenage years, young adult life, adult life, and old age, broken up into chapters based on major life events.My own book wasn't much larger than some of the longer books I already read.A thousand pages, tops perhaps.They weren't numbered.A lot of this was artificial, the footnotes and asterisks and crosses denoting cross-references to other people, and references to previous pages.My life was not, and would not, be exciting.In some sense of sadism, I began looking for some of the more notably meaner things I had done in life.I was never a very caring person, an unfortunate fact, and very utilitarian in views.The only one I could find was a minor thing, in which I dealt with an old woman (Name: Marjorie Willings, death dated two days after the event) harassing a cashier at convenience store.It detailed how I was going to keep out of it, up until the point she turned and involved me, telling me to smile too like I worked there.It even included the whole fake story I told her, how nerve damage in my face caused severe pain if my lips ever strayed too far in one direction, making even speaking a delicate balancing act between comfort and extreme pain.It detailed how she broke into tears and apologized (and my noted "Fuck off and mind your own business.")as well.Furthered in my curiosity, I went and found her book, and checked near the end of it.Apparently that experience shook her badly, to the point she challenged her own beliefs, and unable to stand herself afterwards, she killed herself with her own pain medication."Good."I thought to myself, and said aloud to more or less break the silence that had settled around me.It was a smug word, but true.I hadn't liked her in that brief moment, still didn't like her now.I carried on my reading, or rather, rereading of my own biography.Hunger grew as I did, but as time didn't seem to be moving notably, my wants and baser desires temporarily suspended in whatever anomaly this was, I began cross referencing everyone ever referenced in my book.I'm sure days actually passed (according to my own book, which had this escapade, I'd come back to the normal world in two hundred and forty one days), but I never felt any hungrier, thirstier, or tired.But then I encountered something strange.It was worded as such later in my biography, as I could recall it, but it didn't go into much detail (in fact, much of the book involving the place that housed it was notably vague), but still I found myself somewhat surprised.It involved a boy, myself, and a concert I had gone to almost every year since it's inception.I remembered the event rather well.It was a pretty fond memory, though I remembered the person having been a rather tomboyish girl.The individual in question was passed over in a single sentence (Birth Name: Dean Rogers.Legal Name: Olivia Beau), tossed into me during a bout of wild crowd surfing.To put it as it had been in the book, "The brief encounter occurred when two parts of the crowd hurled us together for the duration of our time aloft, and we could not separate."Though I remember much of the details, even to this day.While I went searching for her book, I recounted them in my head.The shock as I saw what was coming, the time a gleeful scream turned into shock, bodies contorting together.Every time we tried to roll off and away from one another, the crowd pushed us back together.We probably hit every base but home on the short trip to the cutout at the front of the crowd with one another.And then it was over, both of us touching down, breathless and splitting up.Not even a single word between the two of us, drunk on adrenaline.I couldn't find Beau, Olivia anywhere in the Insignificant section.I went back and checked the Significant section.The subtitle stated simply "The First Transsexual President."Bringing her book back to the desk, I checked the cross-reference again (her book, interestingly, cross-referenced Rogers, Dean in the Insignificant section), and started my reading.Turns out, that, while barely a functional sentence in my biography, was an entire chapter in hers.I thought it strange, really.But as I read, I more or less understood.The event from her end was much more... invasive.It shook her pretty badly at first, but after, thoughts turned.... more pleasant, to put it bluntly.It ended up giving her confidence.That little hand high ride, the closeness, made her feel better about herself (who at the time, had yet to come out, let alone begin full transitioning.Something, the book noted, she never completed, at her own choice).So while it was initially traumatic for her, filled with panic and worry, it ultimately ended up being a defining moment in her life she viewed with a positive lens.She even credited that day in a later speech as being the one that started her career that was, politically speaking, meteoric, securing the presidency at thirty-six.Admittedly, I felt impressed.Shutting the book, I had to make a decision.Time was still a little wonky here.I was growing hungry and thirsty.I began shelving everything back in its appropriate spot.Terrible human being though I was, I was a librarian by profession.These things had to be done.Plus, it gave me a little bounce in my step to know I had affected someone so positively, despite being, as the books had determined, "Insignificant."I knew, knowing my personality, that this likely wouldn't alter my borderline misanthropic ways much, but for the time being, it gave me some pleasure.Choosing a direction, the one that looked like all the others but I was relatively sure I had entered this ethereal domain, I exited what I quickly, and briefly, dubbed L-Space in honor of Pratchett and stepped back into the world.Shame I'd have to get a new job after my two-hundred and forty-one day absence.I'd have to make up a story.
