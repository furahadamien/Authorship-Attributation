I stare at the man in interest.Well, I saw him as a man.We are face-to-face currently, but over the screens, I saw him as a wispy, gray creature, with many eyes and long, tapered fingers ending in black."Yessss, the Ghooossshhhaaa," he hisses, his voice vaguely resembling a kettle that is boiling over."You've seen them, yesss?There are many..." His voice trails off, a result of the translator beginning to adjust.It's so slow, but the BER hasnt gotten funds lately."They walk, they fly, they swim... Stars, can you not see them?They walk as you do, they speak as you do, they know you, yet you do not know them?"I'm speechless.This, this, man has accused me of ignorance in front of all the world!Doesnt he know how this will tarnish my image?On second thought, he probably does.It does make him look good, after all.Snake!I grit my teeth, my perfect smile never falling from my perfectly controlled face."I'm sorry, Ambassador.I'm afraid I don't know these 'Ghoosha', as you put it.Is there, perhaps, and equivalent word in our language?""Yes, they call themselves sh-" His voice is sharply cut off.I stare, in fear and curiosity, straight in my seat.Is he having a fit?A heart attack?(Does he have a heart?)His face goes pale, his illusion slipping.A cold wave of terror washes over me.I've seen this once before.It was when a juvenile of their species attacked a human, resulting in a poison dart.In the last moments of his life, the illusion fell.His face is almost fully translucent.I can see the tips of his fingers.They are pitch black.Then as suddenly as the fit came upon him, it leaves.Shocked back into reality, I jump to my feet and rush to the ambassador, kneeling beside him.But it is hopeless.He is dead, his illusion existing only in memory.I'm suddenly terrified.Their ambassador has died, on our planet, in our midst, seemingly at our hands.This could spell war, and frankly, I don't know whether going nuclear on them could stop that.I'm feeling cold right now.Over a few moments, the feeling intensifies, until I feel a cold breath fanning across my right ear."He was giving away our secrets, Ambassador.Do not make the same mistake."
