I flicked away the black widow from her arm.The man she was trying to save, gasped.His emerald green eyes widened."It literally just flew off you."He said."Told you I can't die."He rummaged around in his a blue pouch wrapped around his neck.He took something out in a fist.I couldn't see it, but I felt slightly comforted.I knew what he had in his hand.I knew a lot of things though.Especially if they helped me a few times.I hope it killed him, maybe something with a bang.Like a grenade."Eat this" he said, shoving a pastel green cube into her hand.It was on the tip of my tongue.I knew that cube.She popped it into her mouth.And I remembered.It was mainly arsenic trioxide and coloring now.But the moment she ate it, it all came flooding back.All the children that are it on accident.The cults in the last decade that sought the rapture with it.I remember the lost animals and pets died from it.I remembered how humans discovered it in ancient Egypt.And how they made it, through their species span.I remembered how they used it to kill rodents.And how much easier it made my job for me.I remembered the chemical pathways it traveled.The vibrations it affected in space, and the undulations in time, is caused.So snuff out a little bit of the spark.I remembered everything there is, everything there was, and everything there will be about rat posion.And the moment she closed her mouth, I changed it into sugar.Padma choked.She spat it out, reflexively.Into his face.He took a finger, still sinking in quick sand.But ever.So.Slow.If he went slow enough, maybe he would die.I'd have taken that.A joy in watching even this idiot die.But he wasn't shittin' slow enough.She was only supposed to spit it out in two dimensions.And there was gonna be almost no glorious consequences for her.No water into wine.No impervious to cuts and bruises except on a heel.No magically reinforced bones.No being able to move mountains.No regrowing organs.No walking on water.If he was slow, he died, she lived, and the whole event would be so inconsequential.It would work without him.I knew all about him in that moment.Just like the rat poison.But the cards never got dealt in my favor anymore.In two stupid realities, she spat it out.And I knew in almost every timeline, he wasn't slow enough.He took his finger, wiped the goopy, spitty, sugar, and ate it.Swallowed.How I wish I could just turn it back into rat poison.But since Padma was born, I couldn't alter reality to hurt others.I could only alter her reality.And I saw everytime, when I let her die, or helped her die, or forced her to die, it went blank.Then we went back to the moment she died and I changed it so she didn't.I remembered the blankness.I died too.We caught on pretty quick.It took me a whole Yuga, to catch on.Or so it seemed.She was 1 then.It only took her till age 4 to understand it too.But by four, I managed to pack in a lifetime of hurt and misery.It made her timid, but it also made her frightfully smart.She was smart enough to know that she couldn't die.Shouldn't die.And that made her brave.Sometimes.So this idiot, swallowed the sugar she spat on him.And didn't die.Then he smiled at her.And then his eyes flicked, incredibly.Into mine.Then back on her.It was almost coincidental.Like a micro-flutter of his eyeball.Or a sign of seizure.I prayed it was, hoping he would die.But dreadfully, He bowed, ever so slightly.And he told her."My name is Kal.I lied, I do need your help.I need you to jump into this pit.Grab onto me.I'm pretty sure we won't die"

And I gasped.Because, it was then I truly knew him.
