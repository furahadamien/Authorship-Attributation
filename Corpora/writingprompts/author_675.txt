I want to see my mother and my father again.All of my family who have passed on.I want to see all of my sweet, sweet dogsAinsee, Goliath, Horace and Missy.There were all good dogs.But most of all I want to see my sister again.She was only a couple of years older than me, however just above the cut-off age, and I...just below.I was permitted the gift.She, and everyone else I knew older than me, was not.The news says that the scientist who discovered the secret to countering the effects of aging has herself now died.She developed the regimen.The daily pillor rather, the gift, we called it, at the timeand the monthly, quarterly and annual bodily inspections and tune-ups and replacement parts all of which are now routinely provided by the healthcare centers.She chose her death.Her last words were: "Immortality is not a gift.Death is."Her final breath broadcasted live on her video blog as she injected herself with a euthanasia drug.Nowadays when I walk down the street, thinking of those who, ages ago, passed on, the last to die a natural death, and I look around at our societyat the stagnation, at the lack of young people, at all the old buildings whose faces are all kept clean and brightly painted but still, somehow, seem to be crumbling from the inside outI wonder whether she, the discoverer of the gift, was right.I wonder whether my sister was the lucky one."You don't have to worry about a thing," my sister had crooned on her deathbed."There's a better place.I know there is."I shook my head in disbelief and rage.Stupid government cut-off ages.Insipid regulations!I grasped her frail, mottled hand in my own yet fresh, strong, young-looking hands."I've known this was coming...I've known...but now that it's here, it's just...so unfair!"I felt the tears run hot down my cheeks."Unfair!"She shook her gray head calmly.Wiped the tears off the tip of my chin with the blanket off the bed, there, in the dying place."I'll live on here," she had said and pointed to my heart.She passed on the following morning.I went on a ten-day bender, drinking myself till I blacked out, after that.I ended up having to go for a tune-up and parts replacement a month sooner than scheduled...

As I walk down the streets these days, I see people protesting.Signs saying: "Death is *the* gift God gave to mortals!It is hubris to deny it!"and "Down with the mandatory pill-popping!"and "All of humanity will go extinct if we keep on like this!"Funny, that the pharmaceutical and medical technology which enables longer life, as well as better quality of lifeno fatal diseases, nothing barring a gunshot wound to the head or heroin overdose can be life-threateningthan ever before, have brought about the real societal scare of humanity going completely extinct.Because we won't have chlidren.Because most of us can't anymore...The drug's side-effect is total and thorough.My body, too, will not produce eggs anymore.I have some frozen, in an egg bank, but the supply is finite and I've never found any mates I wanted to have children with.Now I know I never will.That's okay.I never much minded living alone.But I don't want to face true eternity alone.I hope beyond hope that what my sister believed in is actually true.That there is a better place and that I will see her again.Oh God, I hope...There are thousands of people, nowadays, gathering in public places committing mass-euthanasia.Hands held.Holding flowers to their chests.Breathing their last together.The government, I expect, will lift the mandatory rules.The few young people there are will never be given the gift and they will be forced to age and die.The gift will probably end up banned itself.People will have to fear death once more.But maybe they'll learn from us, from our generation.Maybe they'll learn that after the long years of life, after all the suffering and the bearing witness to sufferingwhich of course has not ceased, if anything we've only become *more* greedy, not lessthat it is indeed a gift to die.That death is indeed brother to mankind.A long lost brother we can finally welcome home...

"I will tell myself this," I say to myself, as I walk down these streets."When I finally lay myself to sleep..." And what a sleep it will be.Rest, at last.I pray now, though I never did before.Prayers are all I have left.
