I walk along the street.It's a normal night like any other.Nothing special until I see the sun rise.Something was different the light was too bright.Far too bright.I close my eyes and they still burn from the light.I try covering my eyes as they're closed yet they're still burning.Until I can no longer see the light.I open my eyes to find darkness.I open my phone and say.Hey Google call 911.I hear cars crashing in the darkness.I get up and run away from the noise.I stumble and fall but I manage to follow the sidewalk home thank the gods I was taking my normal route."911 what is your emergency?"The lady says.She sounds just as scared as I am."I can't see something blinded me this morning as the sun rose."She pauses for a second."Are you safe?She says."I find her question strange."Yes I managed to find my way back home."She sighed a bit."I'm blind as well and so are all of our emergency service workers.Just try and turn a radio or TV to a news station and await further instructions.We're all working in the dark right now.I don't even know how to tell people where to go!"She begins crying and then regains her composure."Stay safe."she says as she hangs up.After years we manage to adjust and somewhat keep surviving cars aren't really a thing anymore.Everyone walks everywhere and cities are mainly abandoned but there's a lot of goods to raid from them to trade for food if you can manage it.Everyone's hearing has increased significantly.It's what we use along with scent to hide from predators mainly packs of wild dogs and occasionally escaped zoo animals.Just as it seems we'll adjust to our blindness.I am hiding from something I've never heard before in a shop.It doesn't sound like anything I've ever heard.All of a sudden I'm blinded again.It's like the blinding light from before.I see inside of the walls of the shop.Don't let them know you can see.Who were they talking about.Then as I step outside I see exactly who they're refrencing.Floating orbs with what seems like endless tendrils.They are carrying different people away.I go back into the shop and find a pair of thick black shades.I put them on my face and I pick up my walking staff.What in the world happened that day.Then I hear the "drones" that drop food to us.I see a few people come out of hiding.Turns out what we thought were drones were nothing of the sort.They latch there tendrils onto the faces of those nearby.Pumping something into us.Come to think of it the closer I look at them they don't look human at all....I try to walk normally back to the store.It's pretty easy to find a mirror since nobody would be raiding those since we're all blind.I look into it and my skin is moist with tendrils forming around my mouth.I was too distracted earlier at the return of my site to notice the webbing inbetween my fingers.The scales that were growing on my hand.I begin to have a headache.My blood feeling as though it's boiling.That's right I always went to the "drones" before this.I go back to them.They latch onto my face and begin pumping sustenance into my body.Then I feel it.They know is all I can think.I rip it from my face and I run to the store where I awakened my site.I don't know why.Call it instinct.I break the mirror and write.Stay away from the drones in my black blood.Soon it finds me soon it drags me from the store.It takes me into its mouth.I feel myself disappear this isn't death.It's rebirth.I awaken my eyes are working.I am hiding from something.On the walls of the store I'm hiding in there are two messages.Don't let them know you can see and beware the drones.What does this mean?
