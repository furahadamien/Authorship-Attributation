I waited at Port Broken Zip for more than 30 minutes before Andy came paddling furiously along the river."Hey, sorry, my bad I'm late.I know" He grabbed my luggage and tossed it into the gondola with little struggle."You must be...,"  

"Procrastination," he cut me off."I am the sin of procrastination."We were now firmly set in.I had to give him credit for his speedy packing skills.He gave a firm push and we went cruising down River Zit."Are there many people here?"I asked."Most aren't well known the big shots either make it to hell or heaven but there is the winner of a state pie-eating contest.The good news is that there's no fire and brimstone you only get an annoying tan."We sailed for an hour before arriving at our destination.At the port, I waited for only five minutes before I got the feeling I was being watched.I had to coax the tiny woman to come out and talk to me."Oh hey, I'm Janet the sin of shyness she said," Her cheeks turned crimson red as she said this."Anaja the giant should be here, but he's so terrified of strangers.Hold on I'll go look for him.""Will you be long?""I don't know...maybe," she giggled foolishly as she ran away.By the time she was back with Anaja the sun was overhead and I was getting a slight tan."Still better than brimstone," I told myself.Anaja had to be practically held by hand.He fumbled foolishly with my luggage and at one point buried his head in his hands when I asked him some questions.By the time we got to the next destination, I was mildly annoyed with the pair.Fortunately, I found the next man waiting at the location.He was in a sharp tuxedo glancing at a chain watch."You must be Martin," he started as he gave me a firm handshake."Yes I am," I replied with joy at the change in pace.Was he really a sin?"I'm  Mimon, you know I admire the way you placed your luggage.Good work Anaja but you know it's supposed to exactly 30cm from the right foot of the new arrival.""Oops," Anaja was burying his face in his hands once more."Do you think we could do this once more?""But time, you know.""Now now, there's no point in doing something if you're not going to do it right, once again please."We walked back 100 steps and walked up to Mimon once more, going through all the pleasantries."That was great but with a bit more force in the handshake."he said, "once more.""C'mon Mimon, that was pretty damn good," Janet protested.Mimon threw her a dirty look and she started to giggle once more."Never mind we'll do it again."We marched 100 paces back and walked up to him ensuring that everything was just as he asked."I guess it'll have to do," he said in disappointment."Oh my God you're such a perfectionist!"I yelled at him."Yes, I am.I'm Mimon the Forgivable sin of perfectionism.Now you were doing really well but you had to bring up God and he's not here today.If you could please go back 100 steps and we try it again."***
