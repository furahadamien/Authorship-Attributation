Its just before noon when the knock comes at the front door.Ive been expecting it, but my hand goes to the pistol just the same, even though i know who it is.Even though I know that the gun wouldnt be of any use.I always wear it these days, even at home.Its a comfort thing.I stand away from the door, gun in hand, and call out, in my toughest-sounding voice, Identify! 

Reflexively, i brace myself for the boom of a shotgun blast coming through the door.It is reinforced, but one never knows these days.The animals beyond that door are hungry, and they are wily, and they have bigger guns than mine.Prime Delivery, comes the reply, as expected.Your grocery order. He sounds young, and nervous.Just leave it in front of the door, thank you, i call out.Just because this boy has gotten a job running same-day deliveries for the few remaining prime customers in this area doesnt necessarily mean he is trustworthy.Safety first.Thats how i still have this nice home to live in, and a working computer to order groceries from.Thats how Ive stayed alive all these years.And what lovely, long, enjoyable years theyve been, Lucifer says pleasantly as he strolls into the front room from the kitchen.Hes been listening in on my thoughts again, obviously.All your rules, all your precautions.Never one for taking unnecessary risks, were you?

I am trying not to listen, peering out through the peephole to see that the delivery boy has gone and the coast is clear, opening the door just enough to get the three large bags inside then slamming it shut behind me.Trying not to listen, but then he does have a way of making himself heard, doesnt he?Always did, even when one doesnt want to think about what he had to say.I took a risk once, I reply.When I met you.Ive lived to regret it.Havent seen a need to take another one since.

And so it is.Because we cured just about everything, didnt we; or rather I did, with his help.Cancer, Alzheimers, heart disease, all those other organs.All those diseases.And, finally, aging itself.All things of the past, now, thanks to the limitless time and money he gave me, just as promised.Everything cured, that is, except getting shot in the face at your front door by gangs of marauders.So.Precautions.Dont you miss it? Lucifer asked, helpfully picking up the smaller of the three bags and bringing it into the kitchen.I sigh, following him into the kitchen.Not much point in engaging him.Not much point, either, in trying to ignore him.Hes not going away.None of us are.Miss what?

Danger, he says, and in his mouth the word sounds intoxicating.The thrill of knowing that its all temporary.The urgency of feeling that what you long for cant wait.The sweet ache of knowing the things you love cant last forever.

Whats wrong with lasting forever? I ask defensively.He pauses, looks at me with a slight smile.When were down below, Ill remind you you said that.

I ended suffering.I ended the pain of loss.Someone had to do it.Only I could.

Indeed, he replies, taking a box of ammunition from the grocery bag and placing it in the pantry.And how they love you for it.

Weve been over this, over it and over it.I couldnt have known what would happen.

You might have *guessed!* Nobody dying?Anywhere?*Ever?* he asks, opening his eyes wide and gesturing dramatically with a bottle of synthetic wine from the grocery bag.Where exactly did you think they would all *go?* What did you suppose they would all *eat?*

That part wasnt my department, i reply wearily.This argument, this dance, its one weve performed a thousand times before, a million times.It is, after all this time, one of the few things we have left to talk about.Nothing to talk about but what has been done, and nothing but all the time in the world to talk about it.This is my life now.This is my hell.Its been about a hundred a fifty years since the final discoveries were made, and we published our results.No more need for disease, we had proudly proclaimed, nor for aging.No more slow, painful deterioration of our bodies or our minds, but youth and strength and good health for everyone, for all time.That was what we had discovered, what we had promised.And it was true.For a time.It happened first in the cities, as they began to swell, and grow, until eventually everywhere was cities.Empty space was one of the first things we ran out of, even before fuel, before food, though they had followed close behind.We had always known that the population would one day outpace our ability to feed and house everyone.What we hadnt known was that, when it happened, we would have made it impossible to starve to death, to die from exposure.That, once the treatments had been given out, people would be able to just keep getting hungrier, and colder, and meaner, and angrier, and more hateful, and more desperate...and that they would never die from any of it.And, of course, through it all, babies kept coming.The sterilization programs could never keep pace with the birth-rates.A mad, starving, homeless centenarian with the body of a twenty-year-old will, it turns out, still want to have sex.And so it had gone for a few decades.Resource wars.Water riots.General collapse.Eventually though, things sort of levelled out into what those of us left call the Long Calm.Calm, that is, for those of us not outside.Those of us who made our fortunes in medical tech or weapons or water, and who could afford to keep ourselves holed-up in fortified homes, eating food we had ordered online and otherwise keeping our doors locked.Calm enough for most folks to tolerate, anyway.Of course, most folks dont have the Prince of Darkness as a permanent houseguest; that privilege is mine alone.Im special.Once the Long Calm had set in and people had stopped dying with any frequency, he had simply shown up at the door one day, looking dapper, and bored, and peevish.Not much business down below anymore, he had said.No new clients coming in, as it were.You saw to that. 

It had been some fifty or sixty years since I had seen him last, since that night when he had made his great sales-pitch to me in the parking lot of my laboratory and I, weary and frightened and desperate for any chance to do some good in the world, had signed my name, and kissed his hand, and promised him my eternal soul in return for the money, the time, the resources I needed to change the world forever.Sixty years gone by as he stood at my door, and he didnt look a day older.But then, come to that, neither did I.You said you were mine, he had said that morning about a century ago, strolling past me, through my doorway and into my home.I said my *soul*, I had replied.Not my house.

You said it was worth any price, he had said, as fires burned outside my door, and in his eyes, and far, far below us.You said you wanted to change the world.And so you have.

And so it is.Decade after decade, locked together in this house, as a dozen billion people outside my door scream endlessly for food and water and revenge.Locked together with nothing to do, but talk, and wait.Still, hes tidy, and he doesnt need to eat of course, and his clothes never seem to need washing.One gets used to it.Given enough time, I think to myself, putting away the last of the food, one can get used to anything.Not anything, he chirps amiably from the living room.Youll see.

Stop doing that.
