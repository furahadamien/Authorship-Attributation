The sound of a bell signified the beginning of a ceremony was about to commence.This year was the hundred year anniversary of a memorial, dedicated to the reclaimation of Earth from extraterrestial invaders.The once charred Earth had bounced back.Shelters became towns, cities are being reconstructed, but while peace had returned, the thought of humans falling into extinction had only begun to dissapate.Though humans were able to rely on mana, a biological energy source thought to only be a myth, it had been discovered the power was fading, and many had scrambled to find solutions to prevent this.Still, the citizens of old towns were merely concerned with celebrating their continued existance."I'm surprised your mom doesn't have you 'baking your ass off' like last year, Anny."Anabelle laughed while trying to repress last year's ceremony.As someone from a long line of fire elementals, her duty was to make food."Mom said she'd take it easier this year, if only because we had too much last year.I may have also told her a certain knight was expected  to be touring tomorrow.""Oh yeah, that too" the girl replied, turning her head up.Unlike elementals, "knights" used mana in its purest form, enhancing their physical prowess and creating weapons that were vital for defeating the extra terrestials.While Anabelle would be expected to cook or help in a forge, her friend was expected to take care of any remaining aliens."I'll miss you, Mary" Anabelle sighed, before hugging her friend from the back."I'll only be gone a couple years.When I come back, I'm taking you to one of those big cities."Mary had broke the hug, turned around, and kissed Anabelle."I love you Anny.""That was the last thing she had said to me."
