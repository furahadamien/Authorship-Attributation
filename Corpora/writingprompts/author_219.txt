Darkness.Damp air milled through the room.The stickiness of a restless sleep awoke Hannah.It's been two years of darkness, stumbling through life, and learning braille.Hannah has refused to even try to open her eyes for the past year and a half, due to the pain of being disappointed every time.It was five a.m. and there was still no significant light, not that Hannah cared now.Hanah in her heavy state, lies in bed for a few more hours attempting to summon the color green into view.Oh how she longed to see the color of the spring breeze combing the grassy meadows, the color of a mossy brook running through a bright forest, the color of life.Hannah was so deep into her day dream when she is startled by a flash of light.She hesitantly opened her eyes but she still couldn't see.She stumbles to her light switch that has been out of use since the Great Blinding.She sits and prepares herself for the possibility of vision but then finally flips the switch.The light splits her head, immediately giving her a mind curdling migraine.Impossible.Hannah squeezes her eyes shut in pain, but eagerly opens them again.What brilliance everything had.Her white curtains glow with light of the sun behind them, the red bedding she chose three years ago slightly faded but beautiful nonetheless.Hannah scanned the room taking in all of the colors that as they screamed for attention.Her eyes then focused on the symbols on the wall that she used to know so well.After staring at them for a few seconds she began to remember something she hadn't realized she forgot.Words.It all came back, every letter she had read, from what seems like decades ago.After recalling everything she knew about reading she felt dread fill her body.She did write those words.They were not hers.Which ment someone had been in her room.DON'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE.DON'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE.DON'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE.DON'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE.These same seven words were written everywhere.Wall.Window.Desk.Door.Her hand.Frantically she left her apartment, tripping on everything as she did.Hannah staggers into the deserted street.The same words were written on a bench, a billboard, a broken down car, and every other surface.Who is them and why can't they know?Movement catches Hannah's eye.A man in uniform rounded the corner onto the same street Hannah stood in.He was to alert to not be able to see.Quickly Hannah retreated behind her front door and watched the stranger.He was carrying a bucket of paint.He starts to paint over the words that were posted everywhere."Damn it.The Eyes are getting out of control.Every freaking street.Is it really necessary?"He says under his breath.The Eyes?Hannah can't even begin to comprehend what she is seeing.Why can this man see?Why is he painting over those ominous messages if everyone is blind?Then as if out of the blue a woman appears infront of Hanna's door."Hannah, let me in.You can't be seen by the Fold" she says as she quickly pushes past Hannah before she had time to respond."Th- the fold?"Hannah stammers, "Wait who are you?How do you know who I am?""I'm Theia, the leader of the Eyes, and that man is part of the Fold, as in Blind Fold.They are the reason for everyone's blindness.They started all of this.""What?We were told that this was caused by that facility blowing up two years ago.It was an accident" Hannah said as if she had rehearsed it."No that's just the story The Fold has told everyone" said Theia, with a tone of disdain and rage.Hannah still was lost in all of this new information and her new gift of sight.Was this a gift?"Why can I see?And why are you, the leader of th-the Eyes in my apartment?Why me?"Theia hesitates, "Let's start at the beginning, I am the Titan Goddess of sight and divine light, mother of Helios, Eos, and Selene.I was called upon two years ago when the Fold, lead by Erebos born of chaos, managed to blind all of humanity.I didn't respond until a year ago because I thought you my love would have fixed it but I was wrong.You have forgotten everything, haven't you, my sweet Selene?"
