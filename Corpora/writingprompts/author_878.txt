The first time it happens, Im saying, *no ketchup, please*, to the grease stained hot dog vendor on 50th, and the city goes silent.Worlds biggest statue garden, and me, just wanting lunch.I take two cautious steps away from that boxed grill, shiny silver reflecting blurred halos of city light, staring as big-eyed as a small town tourist before the horns crack and the world starts again.The guy with my food goes, What gives, man?You want your dog or not?

I say, No ketchup, please, but he looks at the dog in the bun, no ketchup in sight, and wrinkles his big bushy eyebrows.In the mirror at home, burping up mystery meat, I keep saying, *No ketchup, please.* Traffic is still busy outside.*No ketchup, please.* The lady in 4A is still arguing with her boyfriend or husband or drug dealer.I dont really know these people.*No ketchup, please.* But, in the mirror, Im still this soft lump of unshowered loser, time ticking on without me.Thing is, it happens again later that night.When my ma, crackling nagging voice brought to you from some beach town in California, stops talking.This was in the middle of asking *when are you going to get a real job?* Just after the question *are you seeing anyone yet?* Im submitted to this caring, parental questionnaire every Friday at 9pm, regularly scheduled shame, my weekly life crisis, and the answers never change so I hardly listen any more.No, I still live in my shitty apartment.No, I havent been to Mortons.No, Im not seeing anyone.Yes, Im still a lonely, jobless, nobody.When she stops talking, my heart jumps.I'm starting to think about my poor dead mother, lying on some hard bed, surrounded by kitsch beachy decor and a great view of the ocean, all made-up and dressed-up even though she probably hadnt left the hotel all day.But the traffic is stopped.The baby in 4C isn't crying.The yappy dog isn't yapping.So, I'm thinking, she's probably not dead.Taking the only chance I'll ever get, all at once, Im yelling, Fuck you mom! Im screaming, my throat half-confused, half-excited to be making such a ruckus, Im going, Im fucked up, Mom.Im a failure, Mom.

In one, big, pissed off breath, I say, Youre a miserable old woman and you ruined me. 

Theres a normal kind of silence on the other line.The sniffling, buzzing silence.Someone lays hard on their car horn, brakes squealing, all punctuated by incoherent shouting.If I hadnt been so aware of the peace that stopped time brought, Id say it felt like time, the world, had frozen around me.But it really didnt feel that way at all.You need to get out of that city, my moms saying, stifling tears.Its made you into some kind of monster. 

So I did.Time stops nowhere I wanted time to stop.In the middle of traffic, already at a stand-still, nothing happening.People arent cursing, or talking on the phone, or eating, or singing to their reflection.No one is dreaming of being anywhere else because time just...wasnt.It stops while Im in line for snacks at the convenience store, staring up again just as Im making my escape.Goods in hand, I slink to the back of the line and wait all over again.Inconvenient.It stops in the middle of a sad late-night last-call bar hookup.No one looks good that way, frozen like that.It takes me the trip from New York to Colorado before I realise its not me.Im not a masochist and, so far, time hasnt been on my side.Somewhere, in India or Spain, you're fucking with me.Or, more realistically, you're robbing banks or causing trouble and I'm just caught in the crossfire.A casualty of poor timing.Ill find you.Im on a plane to Italy now, someones snoring grandpa (nonno, in Italian) taking up the middle armrest, and Ill look for you.Ive got a trust fund and all of the time in the world.I even showered, just for you.See you soon.--------------------------------

5 June, 2017

Im not sure what to do with this power, if I can call it that.It sounds almost funny to think of it that way, though.Like *Im* a superhero.So far Ive saved people only from humiliation or minor inconvenience, no burning buildings or car crashes, nothing warranting a spandex outfit.Its just that I carry around toothpicks now, scratching out the chewed up meals from peoples teeth.Today, after getting some nice pictures of the Eiffel Tower with hardly any people in the background (I waited over an hour for the opening), I rescued a coffee from the roof of a car and placed it into the interior cup holder.I just want to make an impact.I guess, in a way, everyone is looking for that same sort of gratification.Until next time,

Melanie

The card hissed softly as it was drawn from a neat stack of similarly blue-backed cards on the large wooden table, its surface battered and worn from hundreds of years of use.Though her figure was mostly hidden by the Head of Neighbourhood triptych sheet, three pairs of eyes rested eagerly on Calen as she turned the card in her hand and lifted it up, smiling wryly at its contents.Cut the theatrics and read, elf, grumbled Brond, a large and hairy man.His feet rested atop an empty chair, smaller than his own and wobbling as he shifted his weight against its seat.Hes working late, she said.Again? He replied, seemingly exhausted by the cards message.Large head toppling rearward to rest against the uppermost plank of the chair back, hair spilling over the wood, Brond shut his eyes.Calens smirk sustained.Though different in their distinct features, Azezus the Blight and Crog wore matching expressions, lips pulled tight and curved, showing teeth as they grinned with amusement.The game sat on the table, two tidy piles of cards and character sheets scattered.Everything behind Calens trifold was a mystery.Again, she repeated.Brond ran meaty fingers along his wrinkled forehead, massaging between the furrowed brows as he thought.After a sigh, he said, This is the third time this week. 


And the young secretary card is in play, chimed Azezus.Damn the gods, Brond cursed.I go to his work. 


What a fool, said Azezus.Brond frowned, eyes narrowing in the necromancers direction.Excuse me?At least I *have* a husband. 


Mines dead-- 


Does it make you feel impotent to know you cant even bring him back? Crog laughed.Please, you cant fathom the pressure of being a single mother of three little heathens, Azezus accused.They eat so much and the bills are piling up.Do you know how much debt Jason left me with?I thought we were doing well until he died. His sharp slender finger drifted down his character sheet, head wagging agitatedly from side to side.If only you could bring him back and shake his bones for a couple more bucks maybe your kids wouldnt have to go to community college, Crog continued to taunt.Youre in couples counseling, your son is a prescription medication addict, Brond countered.Calen watched them, peering over the edge of her text-rich sheet.The smile that had formed upon reading the drawn card had yet to diminish and had grown only tighter from fatigue.Their arguing began to overlap.Voices raised until the volume was such that even Calen herself was finding it difficult to decipher the nature of the various delivered insults so, raising a hand in the air and not saying a word, she tossed two dice onto the table.The clatter, though quiet, hushed the playful fighting.You go to his work, drowsy from imbibing several glasses of ros, Calen said, But he isnt there.


Damn it, Brond muttered.His fist landed heavily against the table.I thought better of him. Fingers clenched and nostrils flared, he grunted, Its snack time, Im famished.Send me to the bar, Ill wallow in the realisation that I married a dirty cheater. 


You have a teenager and a toddler at home! Corg interjected.And you have your raging Orc of a mother-in-law, Margaret coming over in the morning but youve spent no time straightening your home, Brond scoffed, Mind your own problems. 


Sliding his character sheet toward the centre of the table with a resentful sneer, Bronds large boots thudded against the floor.In a single graceless motion, palms leaning into the table top, he stood up and walked toward the pantry.------------------------
