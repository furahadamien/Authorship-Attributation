Hello, Im Piella the princess !Who are you?
I literally just woke up, what kind of new hell is this??I roll open my eyes enough to side-eye her.Duh fu... I stop when Im somehow jerked full awake and forced to see the source of the aggravatingly high pitched voice and exuberant energy.Shes little and kind of cute with her big eyes and button nose.Speaking of little, the chair is little, uncomfortably little.As I shift my weight to try to make this chair more than a torture device, she gets in my face with the innocence of a curious puppy, whats your name?Doouuufuuu? 
No, no my name is uh Dufulla, Im a magic fairy witch 
  Ooh, are you baad? Her big eyes widen, in horror and glee.Shes a nut.no, no, Im nice to nice people.But I can make stuff
Ooh, Here is your tea...(ssss) Look Pinky, Cookie and GerGer is here 
She runs to her little bed where some stuff animals are piled on her pillows.As she squeals and talks to them, I look around this room.My stomach sinks and my heart beats loud and hard like a bass drum in a rock band.The room starts to swirl around.The pink flower wallpaper, the tan carpet, the Barbie house, the faint smells of perfume, dove soap, wood and dust.In a cold sweat I turn look at her again.Fortunately she is engrossed in talking to her stuffed animals.Shes wearing a dress that is fifty sizes too big.I recognize that dress, it belongs to a tall, lanky woman who loved that green dress with the shimmery tulle.She wore it well and often throughout the year.Piella is also wearing a straw hat thats only  kept off her eyes by her pig tails.The masculine stiffness and width of the brim emits sweat and cut grass from across the room.It strangely goes together in a fashion far ahead of this time.The birthmark on her arm dances as she gesticulates to GerGer.GerGer never wants to play, he always just wants to go outside and climb trees.I always have to tell him that 1.Its his job to play with me, 2.Tigers dont climb trees in the forest.They play in the jungle on the ground.3.He cant get dirty because if he does hell have to go in the whirl machine and he might lose his sparkle whiskers!Silly GerGer, he always forgets.Shes defeated and grabs Pinky, Cookie and Lulu.They sit at the table and she pours tea, hobbles to her seat, and takes off her hat.Without the hat shading her face, I see the bump between her brows the stitches on her brow and left side of her face.I flinch thinking of that stupid babysitter, she was always on the phone!I thought I was so smart to use a ladder.GerGer wants to climb in the trees and eat birds.That inevitable fall was hilarious.That would have been a viral video.She looks like Mickey Mouse with her pigtails tied around into a knot.After a dramatic sip, she really is such a nut, she uses the plastic princess plate, like a wand, to introduce us.Princess tutu, (pointing at me) this is princess pinky, princess cookie and prince lulu!Prince GerGer doesnt want tea today.Hes not rude he is just sad  
I nod and gulp down the tea.It burns my tongue and immediately unsettles my stomach.What kind of tea is this? 
Its sweet tea without tea
I look at her, is she serious, right now?Shes whispering to pinky and sipping with all seriousness.She really is so adorable.She, then, looks at me, smiles and says in a loud whisper.Pinky said that the party has to be quiet.The queen and king get up when the clock says 8 and two zeros.Eight and two zeros, when the clock says eight and two zeros, the party is over.Poof! She knocks over Cookies cup with the poof.I set it right for her.Cookie mouths thank you to me.Then Cookie slowly proceeds to wipes off the coffee of her lap.Coffee??I look at each of the stuffed animals cups.Lulu has chicken soup, Pinky has wine, and Piella has, I strain to see...  I have the same tea as you, tutu.I drink it normal.Yours is too hot. 
 why do they have different drinks though?
She sighs deeply and pouts  I say it over and over again.Every time.They drink their favorite drinks.Its not my fault.I pour the tea and stuff comes out.They dont play princess right.Pinky and cookie dont listen to me!They insist on nasty mommy daddy drinks !Lulu only likes soup and will not be a princess .And they make me  drink this nasty stuff because my stomachs angry. 

My heart starts to throb and my throat feels like its choking.She starts to sniffle and winces and sniffles more.I dont want want her to cry and the salt get in her stitches.Its okay.Its ok.This is just our own special princess party ok, I forgot.Please dont cry princess.Youre a very nice princess hostess. 
The others nod their heads and continue sipping.Even GerGer hops off the bed, and wobbles to Piella, and squeezes her hand.She sniffles lighter, and picks up GerGer .Whats a ostest?
Im about to answer when Cookie interrupts.a hostess is the girl who has the party idea 
Oh 
We all return to sipping our drinks.I remember now, being here before.Vaguely, I feel     a sense of accomplishment.I hadnt felt that in a long time.Im thoroughly exhausted and suddenly, want nothing more than out of this room.Just as suddenly,GerGer jumps off Piellas lap and runs in a sprint towards the bed, hes followed by Pinky, Cookie and Lulu.At the same time Piella is  throwing  cups and plates in an open box and snatching the chairs away, including mine.I can barely make an oof as I expect to land ass first into a hot and wet mess of hot liquids and alcohol.Surprisingly Im completely dry as is the carpet that Im now lying flat on.I pull myself together myself as I hear princess Piella in the hallway howling.I begin to laugh when I realize that she had tripped on that big ass dress when she ran to her parents room.Her or rather our mom lightly scolds her for taking clothes out the dirty clothes.She also checks our stitches and our bump which now are rawer and more sore.Oh, sweetie pie, why wont you just stay in bed until we get youup.Your body needs rest... I laugh at her frazzled hair and her half on bonnet, from Piellas room, of course.I see it so clearly.Then I shudder.I dont want her to see me, not like this .Like magic I shrink to the size of the stuffed animals.I wish this had happened earlier when I was in that god awful chair.Nevertheless, I run to Piellas bed and burrow myself into the mass of stuffed animals.I say  excuse me and sorry but none of them respond.Once safely hidden from sight, I push an eye out to see the alarm clock on the nightstand.Its 8:15.
