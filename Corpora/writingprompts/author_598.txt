....The list of names goes on to cover 6 sheets of newspaper.All dead.Every single one of these people had a life, a family and friends.Now, each and everyone of them dead, because of me.My tears slowly drop onto the newspaper, each time falling onto a different name.The name of someone who no longer existed.I turn back to the front cover.Its a picture taken from the aftermath of the so called q-fever catastrophe.There were corpses heaped in a pile on the side of a road, faces with eyes still open and a figure wearing an eerie looking gas mask.I couldn't help but draw connections with images of the black plague.I read the description next to it."Let us not forget the q-fever catastrophe.On this day 10 years ago Dr Von swag Breinstein aka the Mad Scientists (pictured page 5) released the deadly q-fever virus in the city of Atropilas killing upwards of 5000 people and sending the city into chaos.""Why would I do this?"
