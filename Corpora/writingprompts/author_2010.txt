Millions of years have passed since my birth, and my death, and I have seen the stars fade from the eyes of all my descendents.Before I had eyes that could not see, and ears that could not hear, I had a beating heart.I was the oldest in my tribe, but this was before age was a concept.Marked by my wrinkled leathery skin and trembling hands, the others sensed I was a liability.Before language, before fire, before agriculture, I had no way to know that I was the first born and the first to die.Where I came from and who I came from was not of importance.My days consisted of hunger, and the urge to sate that hunger, and that was all I knew.When my tired feet tripped and stumbled over thorns and shrubs and I could not keep up with the others, they continued on, never faltering.There by brown the Oak I took my final breath, in quiet and solitude.Gone were the vibrant hues of color, the sensations of sound and the motivations which drove me in life.Instead I found darkness too dark to see, and a silence that somehow rang even without ears to hear it, and I was terrified.I longed to feel something, anything, but I had no arms to reach out with, no feet to feel the weight of my body on, I even would have welcomed pain.I am not sure how long I went on in this state.Forever can feel like no time at all, and so I would often forget that I exist, only to be snapped back into darkness after indistinguishable amounts of time--no, time did not exist in that place.Until, that is, I felt it.One of my own was joining me.I still do not understand how, or why, but it was the only thing that I was certain of in a long time.When I saw it again, the world that is, for a moment I could not comprehend it.Even my own identity was lost to me.I was simply a being, a conciousness.I recognized the other soul as one of my kin, one who had left me behind in life, but I felt no contempt, only relief.As the light of life faded from them, language burst forth from me, the culmination of eons of formless thoughts condensed for one purpose--I was the first, and I was to guide them."Do not be afraid of the dark.Embrace it, so it may carry you into light."As the final breath escaped their lungs, I found myself in the darkness again, only now I did not fight it.
