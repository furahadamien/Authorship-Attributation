LoveBarkeep
He was a neckbeard, looking for a reason to visit her again.He had acquired her (and her live-in bodyguards, dogs and hitmen) 
new address of residence... he was very talented and resourceful (googled and paid the $14.99 for the first address lookup site)

Avas, alas and astoundingly... he crossed paths with her shinobi Ninja clan bank/jewelry store robbers...and was spared death by katana by the (perceived) merciful love of his high school sweetheart who thinks he's the baddest badass CoD player to have ever had one girlfriend in high school.He also had great taste in trenchcoats, wrote eloquently and ordered great bounty of DoorDash from Taco Bell usually - the man is a Don, a Boss like Ricky Ro$$.I *am* the man, and she is *my* girl!He was almost done speaking in the third person... he was now arriving at the address he found... but no cars are in the driveway.The jackdaw skreed... he was now walking up the steps to her door...He was---

---**ssssvooop** **sssvooooooop**

So, he shows up to my decoy address (no international crime babe Lord lives at a suburban home listed on Google)

My pet Jackdaw alerted the rest of its murder (or whatever you call the groups of crows) which then alerted my drone surveillance grid...I couldn't believe it, he recognized that my shinobi recognized him and spared him silent swift death by Ninja Stars decapitating him.Ninja Stars that go: *pew* *ssssvooop* *ssssvooop* *shing!* as they whistle through the air!He apparently (god dammit, I went to law school, recruited some ex Pink-Panthers, married an American expat who owned a small joint in Morocco.We have twins now got ng to school in Switzerland.We still pick then up every day from school and stay with them until bedtime)

...apparently took that as an invitation to begin stalking me again like he did right after high school!...but he didn't realize the reason I had put him on my no-decapitate list was because I still email and text his parents and call them during the holidays.Skreee!*ssssvooop!* *ssssvooop!* **THUD**

A week later, I get a text from his mom: "I'm free"
