((This is my first time responding to a prompt, please let me know if you like it.Forgive any spelling, grammar, or autocorrect errors.This was written on my iPod Touch.))Olivia- Livvy.... Livvy was always that one girl.No, not the one you see in movies who dresses all nerdy and has a retainer or something in, then halfway through the movie she loses it, the glasses, puts on a dress, does her hair, and suddenly looks hotter than the whole cheer team combined.No, Livvy was the girl who seemed both behind and ahead in the times.She always wore clothes that seemed to be from the 60s or 70s and dyed her hair black before styling it all layered and fluffy.Seems only fitting that the golden strings of the fates pulled us together.We spent all four years together, inseparable, partners in crime, and it would seem partners in life.In school the two of us led our small group of friends, tag-teamed in fights, and would TP the principals house every semester to get matching schedules.Our parents met after the first year and we all started spending Christmas and thanksgiving together, where our parents would always joke about arranging our marriage.And then came the split.We both graduated together and realized we had different ideas about how our lives would go.So we split as partners in life for the time being, but swore wed remain partners in crime.I went off and joined the Army, got deployed and saw some combat as a designated marksman in the Middle East.Even after Id been there a while, everyone still called me Greenie until the day I left.Im no good at segueing into next topics, so Im gonna say it straight.Livvy was the reason I left.A little over four years after I enlisted, I got a call from my parents that shed disappeared.I retired and came home immediately.I got the full story from Livvys parents.Apparently theyd said good night to her and gone to bed, everything was totally normal.The next morning, they wake up and shes gone.And not just her.Her entire room was suddenly emptied out.No bed, no desk, no dresser, no posters of douchey vampires.Not even a dust mite seemed to have been left behind in the room.Her parents tried to file a missing persons report the next day only to find out her records had been erased.There was no evidence she ever existed aside from some photos in her parents house and our memories.We preemptively held a small memorial service for her and would frequently leave flowers in her room.I lived at home with my parents about another year before I got my own apartment and got on with my life.Olivia Remington was gone.Fast forward about five more years, a few flings, my fair share of one-night stands and one trainwreck of a six-month relationship later, and life is going... acceptably.I work as armed security at a large private corporation in the city and Im making my living.But one day in June I went to the gun range to keep my skills sharp as any good American should, and to chat with some other ex-army buddies Id made there.Id made a bet with one of them about a year back that wed have shooting contests each week for a year, and ten bucks per point goes to the winner after the year.The score was cumulative and only difference in score counts for green.After the year was up, I ended up with a 254 point lead and hed finally paid me this week.I stopped at the bank on the way home to deposit it.Id stepped in and just decided to wait in the mile-long line because I dont like carrying $2500 on my person.It wasnt five minutes before gunfire and screaming lit the place up.Everybody on their knees, now! A pair of ski masks yelled in unison.Now, never in my life had I believed I was particularly stupid... except this day, and Im going to spell it out for you as easily as I can.One, Im ex-army.Two, I just came from the gun range.Three, Im licensed and permitted to concealed-carry.Four, I hadnt been carrying that day.Two and two makes four, right?Good.Then you see why I was stupid that day.My first instinct was to go for my hip, where i usually keep my gun.Usually.Upon realizing it wasnt there, I got down and put my hands behind my head.And of course, because I was closest to the door, I was their first hostage/target.Alright, crew cut.Wallet.Now. Ski mask one said, pressing the barrel of his shotgun into my head and outstretching his hand.If he were alone Id have already disarmed him, but his partner was looking.Id be dead before I hit the ground.I just grabbed my wallet from my back pocket and gave it to him, neglecting to mention the $2500 in my jacket.He opened it up and seemed to have read the ID before looking for any cash, and upon reading it, all life seemed to have suddenly drained from his body.Biggs, He said to his partner, who looked back over, we done fucked up.

Whaddaya mean we fu- Biggs stopped cold as his partner showed him my ID, and started to panic.Oh, no.Oh, no, no, no.We held up Daniel Wesson?Shit.Fucking shit, call the cops, Mac.Were turning ourselves in.

Fuck are you saying, Biggs?Shes got arms in the system too, were dead either way if she finds out we held up someone on the No-Go List. He said, before grabbing my hand and plopping my wallet back in it.Were sorry, sir, we are so, so sorry, we had no idea youd be here.Well be on our way now, PLEASE dont mention us to her! He said before turning tail and running out, closely followed by his partner.The entire bank was silent for about thirty seconds before I decided to break the silence.What just happened here? The police arrived soon after and we all have our statements.Their faces showed interest but general confusion over the events.Seems like they knew about as much as I did about whatever was going on.I finished my business at the bank after getting the all-clear and went home.I turned on the tv and went around the counter to fix up something to eat when I heard a reporter say double homicide. This piqued my interest.I went back around and stood in front of the tv to watch.Authorities received a call this afternoon regarding gunshots in the area, and arrived on the scene to find two dead suspects in ski masks and armed with shotguns.They appear to have been executed with pistol fire.Police have formed a perimeter but say they may be too late to find another shooter.We will continue to report as the situation develops. The screen was showing the view from the sky and I nearly shit myself when I saw the bodies from the air.It was the two guys who had tried to hit the bank earlier.What the hell? I wondered out loud, before jumping when I heard a knock on the door.I walked over in time to see a piece of paper slip under my door.I opened the door no more than three seconds later to see no one there, nor either way down the hall.Okay, seriously this time, what the hell? I asked aloud before closing my door and picking up the paper.I unfolded it and saw an address written on it.The handwriting on it was vaguely familiar, but that only served to freak me out further.It was an abandoned factory a few miles outside of town and could even be considered to be off the beaten path.The note was post-scripted with Tonight, 8pm.

I finished making myself a sandwich and ate it quickly, before opening up the safe in my closet and grabbing my old service rifle and some ammunition.I loaded the magazines and stuffed them in the pockets of my jacket and loaded everything up in my car.I drove out to the facility and parked my car about a half kilometer from the place.I walked the rest of the way, with my rifle in hand.I would stop behind cover and try to get a look at the facility through my rifles scope.From the outside at least, there was nothing to see.No one.No motion at all.One thing did strike me as really fucking weird though, and that was the absolute silence.No crickets chirping, nothing.It put me on edge.I moved into the building and eventually, after moving through the building carefully, I ended up in the middle of the ground floor.I soon heard footsteps, what sounded like three pairs, behind me.I turned quickly and raised my rifle, looking through the dot sight mounted on top of the scope and saw two men, each holding a pistol aimed for me.Putem down, guys.Nobody needs to get hurt. I said, my dot sight aimed for the center of ones abdomen.Oh, no. A feminine voice said, a familiar one at that.Someones getting hurt here, alright. She said, before a hand appeared on a shoulder of each of the men, then they dropped to the floor.I DID tell them no guns, and they disobeyed. And who should step out of the shadows but-

Livvy?Oh my god! I said, lowering my rifle.She smiled, and started running at me.She jumped and tackled me in what was easily the biggest hug shed ever given me.I barely had time to put down my rifle and catch her.I thought you were dead!We all did! Despite the added tinge of gunpowder, she still smelled exactly the same as she did all those years ago.No, no, no.Im fine. She reassured.Im more than fine.You look good too.The soldier look suits you. 

And youre still wearing clothes that are older than us. I said, at which point she playfully punched me in my side.You scared me shitless when I heard you got deployed.Dont you ever do that to me again. She said, and I could hear she was tearing up.I wont. I responded, and gently squeezed her small body.She pulled away from the hug for a moment, and the look in her eyes was the same as I remembered from the last day I saw her.The softness of her lips was the same too.
