Standing in my kitchen, currently ravaged by soot and what's probably souls damned to an eternity in hell, I realize that I probably shouldn't have took up the task of making dinner....Last time I used the kitchen it was to get a cup of water.I'm not entirely sure how I ended up igniting said water.Back to the present, as my explosive panic and fear was numbed by the realization that I wasn't fit to be anywhere near the kitchen, pages flipped in the cookbook I found in the attic that I realized was my grandmother's, which I don't remember bringing to our new house.I held down the pages as I looked down at the name of the recipe.'Chicken Soup' With some writing scratched out just above it.Looking up I found the demon looming over me, a good half foot taller, eyes sunken in, a starry abyss that one could get lost in.Skin like obsidian, cracking to reveal pulsating flesh.It's chin was jagged, and nose crooked and large.It's eyes, well I assumed, were on the cook book, then it raised a hand, surprisingly human if you ignored the craggy skin.My lips were dry, so I licked them, my eyes were watering so I blinked.Verging on a panic attack I took a shaky breath as it raised it's hand further above my head before a echoing clap resounded.It's hand impacted it's face.Not loud but a domineering sort of sound, demanding to be heard.I winced, stepping back, but the demon took hold of my wrist and pulled me forward, it's face twisted even further in incredulous anger."You daft imbecile," It shouted, rattling a nearby kettle, "What brought you to a kitchen!Cursed by the very *concept* of sustenance, if not for luck, I can't fathom how you haven't starved!""...So, uh, I know you're sorta angry-" It's skin cracked with what I could only described as anger made into sound, "-okay, a little more than sorta, buuuuut could you maaaaybe help me clean up?"The demon might have been terrifying in all the worst ways, but my wife would be another level of scary if she found the mess I made, plus the demon....Probably more the mess."Are you an idiot perhaps?Have you no knowledge of what a demon does?It *deals*."It punctuated each word with a step before getting in my face, with a pungent scent indescribable."You summoned me with a purpose, subconscious but it is the purpose I'm to resolve as a demon."My brain slowly ticked as I started to understand what he meant."Yes, I'm a demon of gluttony, and I'm here to make that-" It pointed to the frothing soup with *something* swimming in it, "Into a dish that won't cause everything in this neighborhood to go utterly *insane*."..."Wow."I muttered."Yes, 'wow'."It seemed to calm down marginally as it stalked over to the soup.A poignant silence took over the room for a good minute."This is supposed to be chicken soup correct?""Uh.yeah?"Though I thought I made some headway it was dashed by it's strangled cry, "Then *why is there no* \*\*\*chicken?!\*\*\*"

...Knew I forgot something.
