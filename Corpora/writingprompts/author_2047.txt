I'm not really sure why a certain level of sentience dictates that the species be both allowed and guided to the afterlife, but I was apparently the first to reach that level for \*Homo neanderthalensis\*.Well sort of.I would be considered the first of \*Homo sapiens\* but the rest of my clan were what are now known as neanderthals.I've been guiding the Homo family offspring to the afterlife ever since.Fortunately, I get to learn from the generations of people I've guided over the last 320,000 years.Hell, humans are harvesting the energy from stars in distant galaxies now.I was just making rock axes in my day.&#x200B;

Little surprises me about death anymore.I've overseen the carnage of wars, famine, plagues, genocides, religious zealots, population explosions from both cultural and technological innovations.Yet, today I was.I had to escort a chimpanzee to the afterlife.
