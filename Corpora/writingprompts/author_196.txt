Most people lost their sight waking up on the morning of the first day, as the event started in the middle of the night.The change only occurred as one slept, so others attempted to remain awake to retain their vision for longer.This effort proved to be pointless, as the effects took hold the moment they closed their eyes and started to doze.As the days stretched into weeks, Microsleep ended up taking of the vision of the most resilient.Adjusting to the change was difficult, but there was ease in knowing that everyone was blind, and that we all shared the same struggle.Those that were blind *before* the change became valuable assets to their communities.They found themselves teaching thousands, in neighborhoods where there were no blind people before.I spent my time at home, with my animals, listening to old reruns of my favorite TV shows.Years of mental health issues had rendered me unfit to work in the eyes of the state, so many aspects of my life continued as usual.I did miss reading and, although I managed to find a few books in braille, it wasn't that simple to learn.The small dots weren't that clear to me as someone who had recently gone blind.Walking the trails around my house was not an option anymore either.That was then, though.Today, something changed that I didn't anticipate would happen.For the first time in over 785 days, I saw something.There have been stories since The Great Blinding of people regaining their sight.In all cases so far, it has been attributed to an overactive imagination.I must admit that even I have been fooled into thinking I was seeing something.You catch what looks like a flash of light, but it quickly fades and you are reminded that you are still blind, and that it has been the case for over a year now.Today was different.I saw the flash of light, but it quickly expanded to cover my entire field of view.I had to remind myself that I had a field of view again.I was amazed at how much I could see again, but startled at how *forward* everything felt.In my blindness, I experienced my world in 360 degrees.Now, I was seeing only what was in front of me, and I noted how unaware I was of this before.My ears were still trained to the world of the blind however, so I found myself more aware of my surroundings than I remembered being before The Great Blinding.Words started to appear in my vision.At first unfamiliar, but then more clear as the image of what each letter meant reappeared in my minds eye.I had forgotten what letters looked like.'Do not tell them that you can see' were the words scrawled on my wall.The writing was brown, and it had no stench.I looked around to see if there was evidence that someone entered my room while I slept, but I soon realized that the substance was dried and old.Someone wrote this on my wall a long time ago, and I had no idea why.I crept out of my room and realized that the sun was starting to set.After so long without sight, I wasn't surprised that my sleep cycle was so off.For me, it felt like early morning.The sky was illuminated with streamers of light, and everywhere people wandered through the streets, heading for work.The setting sun turned the sky a rich burgundy striped with its golden rays.There were no stars in this sky.In the distance, the trees danced, casting their long shadows on the surrounding fields.Looking closer, I realized they were actually dancing.Tall branches were swaying with their movements as they spun around one another and held each others' arms.Nearby, the people continued with their lives, unaware of the beings in their midst.Translucent birds flew high in the sky and shattered against the stone clouds only to congeal and reform as a different bird.Their chirps mimicking those of any birds I knew of before The Great Blinding.Orbs of light illuminated and disappeared as they moved through the air, sometimes passing through people, unbeknownst to them.There were no roads or vehicles in the street.The asphalt and gravel were replaced with fields of grass; despite this, my feet clattered on the ground as if it were still made of stone.I was so absorbed in my changed surroundings, it was hard to take in.In the distance I heard whispers and, as I narrowed my eyes, I caught sight of a person waving at me to come near.I approached with caution, not knowing who or what they might be."Get in here!"They pointed at my house."Before they notice me."I retreated through the door, and faced the man who was invading my home."Do you have any idea what you are looking at?"He spoke quietly, and stared out the window.The red glare of the night sky cast his face in a bloodied shadow."You have entered the world of the dead. He closed the blinds.You are witnessing things you were never supposed to see.

He turns to look at his mother."Did you just hear that?"The bee on his shoulder moved to rest behind his head."What dear?"She missed the bee."Did I just hear what?""Your Majesty, do not reveal me to her.She intends to kill me.You must remain calm."There was a buzzing urgency in the voice of the drone."The uh...nevermind."He shrugged his shoulders."I guess I was just hearing things."He moved to the refrigerator and started to assemble a sandwich."It's been a long day.I can hardly concentrate."It was true.He had been up for 16 hours so far.It was late and he needed some rest.The bee resting behind his ear terrified him.He wanted to scream and swat at it, but he was afraid of getting stung.He was also intrigued by the fact that apparently bees could talk.He glanced at his mother.Her face was contorted in a look of disgust."Do I smell bees?"She frowned and started gagging."I do.I *do* smell bees."She started picking at her face, as if there were a scab.Her skin grew red as she did this and the look of disgust intensified.She had horrible red splotches all over her neck and face from scratching and she started to make sounds as if she were extremely uncomfortable."Oh my gosh.Do you see a bee?"Saliva was streaming down her lips and she breathing grew ragged."Mom.Are you okay?"He grew even more alarmed.It was as if *she* were having the allergic reaction."I need you... to go to your room.I can't have you wandering around if there are bees in the kitchen."She seemed very distracted.It was quite uncharacteristic of her."Please.Go now.Leave."He stared at her for a long second before he grabbed his dinner plate and left.He made sure to point his ear away so that she would not see the bee.As he walked up stairs he heard a rustling and a crash that made him pause.He turned around to see his mother on the floor writhing as if in pain.Her eyes darkened and her skin turned ashy.He didn't understand what was going on.The flesh on her face sloughed off to reveal an insectoid visage with horrible chattering mandibles.He screamed.She turned to him and lunged.Too late.He was near his bedroom door and locked himself in.She was throwing herself at the door with an unstoppable rage he had never seen before."Wha- what happened?"He asked the bee this.The scraping sounds at the door persisted.There was a tearing sound that made him guess that she was using that terrible jaw to rip down the door."Your majesty, you have been kidnapped.You do not belong in this world.You are a proud prince of the Queen Bee herself.You were kidnapped as a child by wasps that wished to take control of our empire.We must hurry and leave."The bee moved around as it spoke, as if anxious."But how?I'm on the second floor!"He felt terrified.The door still held, but it was shaking more than ever.A buzzing sound grew louder."Your majesty, you must shed your skin and fly."The bee said this as if the answer was obvious.

The primitive create awoke to the sound of rustling birds running through the blades of grass.This world was unfamiliar to her, and she found herself unable to form the words to articulate her feelings, though not for lack of trying.Her jumbled up teeth felt clumsy in her mouth; they pressed against her flat tongue and rendered speech difficult, though not entirely impossible.Looking down, she could not recognize the hairy bodice she inhabited.The world around her was wild and unkempt.Looking around she slowly started to remember.She was an ape, like the ones she read about in... another time.She felt the world she once lived -- and died in -- slowly fade from memory.In a panic, she held onto those images in a vice.She felt desperate not to lose everything that she once was, now that she had returned to the old world.The floor was littered with lurid orange mushrooms that seemed to pulsate in her newly-awakened eyes.Memories of The Bible returned to her.She acknowledged them as the fruit of knowledge, and she was Eve.The humans were wrong.The Fruit of Knowledge was not a curse given by some God.They were, instead, the source of humanity.She stood straighter, knowing that she was the first true human., albeit a primitive one.Another one of her kind approached.She knew somewhere inside herself that they were a tribal species just like the humans of the future.If only she could convince one of them to take a bite of the fruit themselves... She longed not to feel so alone in this world.

"What's wrong with you?"The sinewy, hairless creature stood next to him -- his only friend in purgatory."You've waited centuries for the chance to be judged."Its long fingers wrapped around his shoulder in comfort."This is your chance to cross over."The creature smiled at him."But..." He let out a breath."I'd be leaving you behind too."The creature's sallow face flushed."You know my time will come," it paused and took a breath."Eventually."Finally, he and the creature looked at the empty void that Jaron must pass through to receive his ultimate judgement.So many had passed through before them.Few returned and the rest were sent on their way to either side."You know you must do this."The creature put a gentle hand on Jaron's lower back and urged him to move forward."C'mon."It spoke softly towards the void, facing away from Jaron."We don't know how long the doorway will stay open."Jaron let out a final breath before moving forward.A lump formed in his throat and he looked back at the nameless creature that accompanied him for almost his entire time in Purgatory."I'll miss you."The world behind him darkened as the void grew nearer.The boundary between Purgatory and The Final Judgement was hazy, but one could not turn back once they entered the boundary.The creature was already entirely obscured, which was not surprising.Its spirit had remained in purgatory for much longer than Jaron's; its spirit was too weak and hazy to shine through the boundary.For a moment, things only became darker.Soon, though, a grey light emanated around him and the room came into focus.He knew for certain of only one person that was going to be on the other side.He stopped.The room came to him.*Three* people turned to face him, and his own face lit up in surprise.He knew only one person, and the rest were a mystery.Immediately, his father rushed up to greet him."Jaron!"His eyes welled up."I am so happy to see you again, after so long!"He hugged Jaron and sobbed.His father was covered in ash and his eyes were red.Jaron held him tightly, relieved that his father's scent was still there."I am so happy to see you father."There was a clatter behind Jaron.He turned to see a chair.He quickly sat down.His heart was racing.Chairs appeared behind the others, and they sat down as well.To Jaron's left sat a man he had never seen before.He had a square jaw and light brown stubble.His hair grew wild.His father was to his right and in between them sat a wide-eyed adolescent.The atmosphere changed.Jaron lost the ability to speak and each individuals' eyes started to glow softly in the muted light.His father spoke first."You left me."His voice reverberated across the room, which had no boundary."For years, I tried to maintain contact with you, but I was met with silence."Tears streamed down his face faster.The ash that covered him ran down as well, revealing fresh skin underneath."I was alone for years without you."His voice echoed for several long seconds, and Jaron's voice came, unbidden, from his mouth.He was speaking the truth and could not prevent himself from doing so."You were an awful father."Anger found its way into his voice."You stole my sister's pain medication when she got out of surgery."Memories of her accident came to mind.He remembered her wailing in pain after the medication went missing.He remembered the small tap on the door, followed by a revving engine, when he opened the door and saw the bottle on the floor with not so much as a single dose of her medication and some half-assed excuse for why he took it."You left her to suffer to satisfy your own addiction."His eyes hardened.The joy of seeing a familiar face from just moments ago had vanished.He remembered why he hated him."You only lived for yourself."
