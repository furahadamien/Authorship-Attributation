When I saw those blue eyes I knew it was her.I remember how those gentle they twinkled when we saw the construction of the Coliseum together.How she cried when the Library of Alexandria was burnt down, knowing she couldn't save that knowledge to keep the timeline stable.The sheer curiosity and joy she felt when she discovered my immortality.To think something I always considered a curse would allow me to experience such a moments of happiness.It was adorable to watch her nod as I filled her in the history for our current meeting point.A one too many faux pass will teach you that lesson, least you want to end up Babylonian jail cell again.All those events we saw together have a special place in my heart.The fall of the Wall of Berlin.The first moon landing.The Crucifixion.We were together through so much.Sharing those memories with someone is what made this unending existence bearable.Knowing that every milestone, someone would be there with me.That kiss she stole from me in the Epsilon Eridani colony will always be my favorite.I control myself not to cry as I recall her last breath as we rested underneath that simple tree in Ancient Mesopotamia, enjoying a simple day forgotten to time.As I held her I couldn't help the smile I got, knowing how much this girl would do.It's only fitting I supposed.I was there at the end of her life and now I get to be at the start.It will be fun anecdote to tell next time I see her."Congratulations, Ma'am.Is a girl."
