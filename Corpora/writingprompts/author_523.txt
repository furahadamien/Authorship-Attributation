I sat in the kitchen seat, knowing that i was getting a mug this father's day.My kids seemed so excited after the phenomenon started.I felt honored as i was being given my official ranking.Although they were already 4 and 5 respectively, i knew i hadn't been a dad long and figured i wouldn't place high.The kids swarmed in with their little wrapped box and thrust it toward me.My wife, behind my children,  smiled just as big as them.As i took hold of the box all thought turned to statistics.Did they include ALL dads or just the ones with mugs?What exactly is the measurement?Just how many dads are out there?Why are my palms sweating?Many more questions popped into my head but they were quelled by my wife snapping me back to reality telling me to open it.Carefully pulling the bow strings, i undid that which held what only now i feared the most.Slowly i lifted the lid to reveal a large white mug.Taking it out of the box i turned it to see a large hand painted "#1 dad" on the side.I know it's not one of the official mugs but rather one which my kids made themselves.Crying, i embraced them both telling them that no matter what my true ranking was, i was so happy just to be their dad and that they were the most wonderful things in the world.After they left the room to go play my wife sat down at the table with me.Asking me what i thought of their gift, i responded by saying there was no need to have the knowledge as, to the children, i already was #1.I then got up and made a cup of covfefe in my new mug.Turning back to sit back down i saw my wife already had a cup of her own.She turned it toward me.I could not believe what i saw.There, in her hands, was a mug which said #1 dad.It wasn't painted, it didn't have a smudge, it showed clearly #1.Taken aback i just stood there staring at my wife who had an even bigger smile than when i was given what was in my hands.I still don't know what i did, but i swore that i would always and forever try to be the best dad i could be.No matter what my mug says, i promised i would strive to be better than i am.That is how i found out that i was the best dad in the world.
