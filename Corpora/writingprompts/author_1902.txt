I asked for the cocaine...everyone looked freaked out.I quickly said "justkidding" and took the narcan.Little sips like this happen at least a few times a year.Being as old as I am, yet young compared to the rest of my species, humankind I had issues with that word since the 50's, you tend to just roll with it.The younger dems guys are all in their twenties with patch spots of some FOG <fucking old guys> and ladies on their second careers.But, I wouldnt trade this for anything.I came back from the war different, biologically different, but everything was the same.Science hasnt figured me out yet.CBC, CMP, and all the other lab work comes back pretty good minus some crap lipids due to always working nights not only to hide my age but myself from the world as it repeats over and over.In reality I blame mostly MCDonalds...but when the mcrib is back I'm on it like a blitzkrieg.Every so often old habits come back but some habits are why the new ones exist.They get forgotten.Somehow so do I.People ask how i stay the same and my reply is Avon; we get enough lonely old ladies trying to sell us this stuff as we shuffle them off to the hospital it's a running gag, yet in reality it's a marker that it's time to be on the hunt for a single male in his twenties that is a john doe and move........off to pick up pizza I guess might as well keep those LDL doing something
