Gone.Everyone who fought to keep this plague, all who put in so much to keep it away.All gone.As I lit my unfinished cigarette for the 5th time, took in a drag, I slowly feel the hallucinations start clearing away with every inhale.Ridiculous as it may seem, the plague the city is under, gets into your head, and turns you into a victim of memories.After being infected, your body slumps, and your whole conscious exists only in your daydream.The only remedy is tobacco smoke.Half a century ago, it would've been lunacy to think that cigarettes could one day save my life.Ha, save my life.As I gazed up towards the worn down "no smoking" billboard, I wondered; is this really saving me.Why fight something, when you`re the only one left to fight it with.As last ember of the cigarette faded away, with my final press to the concrete, I sat back.Admiring the sight of sky, smiling as it was my first encounter.I guess sometimes you get mixed up between firsts and lasts.."I've missed all of you"
