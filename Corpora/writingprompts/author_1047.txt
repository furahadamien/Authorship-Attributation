I'm powerful man now, but I couldn't help to think it wasn't truly me who is powerful, but this blasted line.I feel like I'm living the most linear rpg, quest waypoints included.It directed my mouse to trade stocks, my car where to drive, hell it even had me crash my bike on a missing bag of money from a heist when I was 12.I'll never forget that day, there was a massive amount of life lost trying to relieve the treasury of its soon to be shredded bills.Did I feel a bit bad?Sure, but 500k buys a lot of happiness.Green got me to the top, but I was alone here.Friends get sick of your inability to fail, and women come and go, and I was sick of it all but as I took the revolver out of my mouth I realized that red line had grown almost twice the size, pulsing with my heart beat.There was at least one thing left more me to do.As I walked with the red line it swirled around me, my wrinkles faded, I got lighter on my feet, and my gait turned to a pedal."Holy shit"
It was all I could muster to say, and quite a foul line for a newfound 12 year old about to find out he sees lines on the ground.There it was, trusty green, and blood red.I followed the red line with fervor, dreaming of what I might find.But it was just taking me the long way around to the treasury in Richmond.And that's where it stopped, in front of three masked men driving a van, armed to the teeth.I reach for my cell, realizing it's the 90s and I'm 12, it was pretty fruitless... 
"How do I stop this?"The red line pulsed at the van, I was lance with both testicles pedaling furiously in it's direction.I felt my body crumple into it damaging the side panel, people clamoring for help, screaming for the police.The driver didn't like that much, they sped away as I blacked out.I woke up to the news, no heist, no dead police....It all started with a bike crash....
