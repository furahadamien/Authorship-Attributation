I get in my covers a little early today, my large cup of cappuccino in my favorite mug with me.My phone buzzes, 

Sorry for canceling tonight, baby 
Its okay.You have fun with your friends

I get back to scrolling this site I got into a couple of weeks back.Well, why not?Its not like I have anything else to do.You are told you are loved..By whom?The person I love just bailed on me to go smoke up with her friends.She finds warmth in the air of her friends, and the smoke of the lighter.I try and find it in some puny beans.and accepted for who you are By whom?My family would want nothing more than me to change completely, and be in a better college with higher grades and not be a disappointment.Society frowns on my belly and laughs behind my back.Pities my stretch marks for being on me, and stares at the acne on my face.Have a happy holiday season and a great new year... Isnt that what they said last year as well?Isnt that what they said about the year that made me grow tired of trying to repair my broken heart with duct tapes?Somehow trying to get it to beat it again and make it feel again, only failing every time?Isnt that what they said about the year that made me lose my friends?Isnt that what they said about the year that took me 200 miles away from the person I love?Isnt that what they said about the year that took me 6 hours from my home?Isnt that what they say every year?People are stupid, I say under my breath.Drat, the coffee is cold again.
