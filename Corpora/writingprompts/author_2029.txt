QuietlyThundering
The last thing I saw before I died was a tall, thin man in an all black suit."How odd," I thought, "to be wearing a suit in the California summer heat."The last thing I heard was the deafening screech of metal on metal, and then



then, I woke up in a forest.The first thing that hit me was the scent of pine, and grass.And then, there was a gaunt, pale face above mine."Oh, good.You're up.We can go now."I sat up quickly.The weirdo in the suit!He smiled."There, now."He extended his hand to me.Was I supposed to take it?"What's...what's going on?Where am I?""Well, Annaliese....you've died.I am Death, and we shall be going for a walk now.""I'm dead?""Yes.Now, we must get going."After I got to my feet, we walked through the woods in silence for some time.Birds cheerfully chirped above us, and large, green ferns curled at our feet.I saw a few squirrels in the trees, chattering loudly.Despite our natural surroundings, it all felt surreal to me.Everything told me that, logically, this must be a dream, but.... "Oh, no, ma'am.This is very real."I looked up at him."Yes, you are dead.Car accident.Brent- your boyfriend,right? really shouldn't have been texting and driving."Brent!Fucking *Brent.*

We both fell silent again, minus the sound of leaves crunching under our feet.I looked up at Death and said, "Er...." 
 Death looked at me inquiringly."Oh, right!I never said where we were.Trust me, you'll remember."Remember?I was...here before?Anxiety began to creep into my limbs, but I kept walking with him.After 10 minutes, we stood before a large, fallen tree.I saw something shiny nestled into a sideways tree root.He nudged me."Go on.Go have a look."I nervously crept forward, and began to clear the debris."It's a birdhouse.But...I don't understand?Why am I here?Why....."

Death sighed, and leaned against the tree."The departed always have so many questions."I stared at him until he rolled his eyes."Pick up the birdhouse"
 I nodded.The coppery paint shone in the sunlight, and as a beam hit my eyes, and it all came back."I remember-!"He nodded, smiling."I- I played here!!!These are the woods I played in as a kid!And this birdhouse-" I lifted it up, looking at the childish signatures scrawled underneath it- "I made this and painted it with my best friend!!"It felt as though the sunlight had entered my soul, and was filling me.It was so overwhelming, that I began to cry.Death held me as I sobbed.Each happy memory of those childhood summers came to me, and after what felt like hours, the tears stopped.I looked up at him.He smiled gently."You have more questions."The silence hung in the air, and then I said, "Why did I come here?Is this...."

He looked off into the distance."I was also a human, once.When humans die, our souls are supposed to find paradise.Our Paradise."The wind gently rustled the spanish moss that hung in the trees, and he cleared his throat before he continued."I never found mine.I had wandered so much, that I had seen and known all there was, and ever will be.And in that journey, I found other souls- and I decided to help them find their Paradise.""So...this is mine?This is my Paradise?"He nodded."This is your place of rest.You will never want for anything.And, if you so wish, you can visit with other people.""Visit?""Well, of course.It wouldn't be Paradise if you had to enjoy it all alone.Besides, I think you'll find that you have plenty of people who are eager to meet you."I nodded, and rubbed my eyes.We both stood up.He said, "I think you'll settle in just fine here.Now, then, I must be going."Just before he set off into the trees, I yelled, "Hey!"He turned back."I know it isn't your idea of heaven, but....you're always welcome to visit!So come back soon!!!"He smiled, and disappeared.
