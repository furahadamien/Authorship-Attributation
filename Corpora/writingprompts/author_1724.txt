Mage Fire

Dr. Park climbed out from the exposed roots of the tree.The path through the roots had been dark and he didnt trust electronics on this trip so he walked by the light of a lantern.Just like back at home the massive roots bisected a cave system which seemed odd to Dr. Park since that meant the roots where growing through rock deep into the ground.He held his gloved hand to the wall and started walking, it was a trick he learned from one of the spelunkers when they were initially exploring the caves.He sighed, it would be nice to have one of the guys with him now, but that couldnt happen since the sorcerer closed off the cave entrance home.David focus, I need to get out of this cave, no use dwelling on the past.Dr. Park took a deep breath and kept walking.Ugh, I wish I had my phone, at least I could listen to some music to pass the time.The cave was smaller than he expected and it opened up into a normal looking forest.He had been searching for what made this world unique since the other two worlds they had visited had been unusual.Nothing stood out until he had exited the forest onto some farmland.Now he could see the setting sun clearly and for whatever reason it was decidedly purple.Ill have to keep an eye out tomorrow, maybe its just the light interacting with something in the atmosphere.He sat down and finished the last of his rations, hopefully the farmland meant that there would be a barn nearby he could crash in for the night.He didnt want to spend the night outside in a strange world.Well no time to waste.He got back up and relit his lantern now that it was twilight.He was right!There was a barn!Adjacent to it was a farmhouse.There where blue white flickering lights inside which struck Dr. Park as unusual.He wasnt that far when he heard yelling.The back door to the farmhouse slammed open and a number of large men dragged a man, a woman, and two children all gagged and bound into the barn.He could hear their muffled cries.Oh no, Dr. Park said under his breath as he stopped in his tracks.I should avoid that, but I couldnt live with myself if I didnt try to save them.He mulled over that thought for a moment.Theres nothing I can do, I am perfectly justified in not getting myself involved.No one even has to know that

A scream from the barn pierced his thought.Dr. Park let out a defeated sigh.Im going to die here, he said.He ran to the barn hoping he wasnt too late.The thugs had left the door open and Dr. Park took a peek inside.Four posts had been planted, each with someone bound to it.There were five men, four thugs and a well dressed man.The well dressed man was addressing the man who Dr. Park assumed was the father.He couldnt understand the language but when the well dressed man rubbed his thumb against his first two fingers the message seemed to be clear.An order was barked and a thug dumped a pile of hay at the base of the posts.Another thug held a lit torch.There it was!The aberration!If this world fit the pattern of the others then that meant this world lacked fire!They used magic to fill in that gap!Ok David, save farmers, dont die, get a sample of mage fire, move on.I can do this!The thug with the torch tossed it into the hay.David froze.It was too late, it was a bad idea to come here, what was he thinking?The mage fire stayed attached to the torch and didnt spread.Davids brow furrowed as he tilted his head.Thats not right.The thug showed his palm to the torch and spoke one word.The mage fire spread to the hay.The farm family cried out and struggled in vain with their bonds.The fire crackled and raced up the posts and onto clothes.No! David cried reflexively reaching out.The air distorted and the mage fire blew out.David, stunned, didnt move as he tried to process what had just happened.The thugs turned towards David.He didnt remember what happened next, all he knew was he panicked and smashed his lantern onto the thug that attacked him first.He sat on the ground watching as orange flame covered the screaming thug who ran around like a cat chasing a laser.Rolling on the ground didnt seem to occur to the thug who opted to jump into a nearby cart full of hay.What?Is this guy an idiot?The well dressed man had been watching this too and for a moment there eyes met.The well dressed man barked some orders crying out Magi, Magi! and then they were gone.The thugs just left.Their partner unmoving in the cart and still on fire.Besides the crackling of the fire and the night breeze it was quiet.Then the farmers started making noise again.Davids mind started back up, he got off the ground and unbound the family.He had no idea what they were saying but from their tone gratitude seemed to be the message.Im sorry I dont understand, Dr. Park said.One of the children, a teenager, pointed over to the fire, Wosh!

Yeah, thats fire.Here let me show you, he said.He grabbed the flint and steel from his bag and some hay.He struck some nice sparks starting a small fire.They all looked amazed.The youngest reached out to touch it but David loudly objected.Startled she jerked her hand back but not before the air distorted and the fire blew out.David raised his eyebrows, he would have to remember that.The father pulled out his own flint and steel, and gathered his own hay pile.Dr. Park noticed the sparks where that same blue white color of the mage fire.Indeed the hay lit into mage fire.The father promptly stuck his hand in.He picked up the hay and handed it to David who tentatively accepted it.It was warm, gave off plenty of light and didnt burn him or the hay.It stayed on the hay as he tossed it between hands.They spent the next hour teaching each other about fire and magic, well as well as they could without speaking.The father was more than happy to trade flint and steel with David, especially after he helped them put out the thug and bury him.He stayed the night in the barn and before he left they said some goodbyes.The mother gave him some food, water, and a new lamp to take with him.The trip back through the woods was shorter now that he was more confidant of the way and there was proper sunlight to guide him.While it was just as bad here to look directly at the sun David could tell it was a blue white color.Ok, I have mage fire now, good.Just need to get the magic of the other three worlds and Ill be ready I think.He retraced his steps through the cave and back into the tunnel made out of the huge roots.___

The Idea I had was too grand so I tryed to keep it down to something smaller.
