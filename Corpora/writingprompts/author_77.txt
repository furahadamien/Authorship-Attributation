Once, I had travelled with my schoolmates to the Royal Albert Hall in London.It struck me then as cavernous, almost as if the architect had taken a traditional gladiators arena, slapped a dome over it, then filled it with a winding domino-string of seats in concentric circles.Four storeys of seats, all tilted slightly to face the stage, easily four, five thousand people sitting enraptured by the musical landscapes evoked by the symphony.This theatre I was now in, was easily five, six times that size.I couldnt be sure, actually, because there were no edges which I could perceive without my vision starting to swim.Welcome, welcome! boomed a voice from the stage.The spotlights swivelled to where I was standing, bathing me in golden luminance.A warm welcome for Gerry Hanley, please!As you all have seen, he lived a long and fruitful life, yielding in the end only to old age!A peaceful end, if you will!

I didnt know how to react to the entire audience suddenly rising to their feet, clapping as one for me.I was a schoolteacher in my life.I was used to combative classrooms, and certainly not once had my students ever thought to shower such appreciation for me.I waved weakly in response.And now for the results Gerry Hanley will be going to Team Blue!

The groans from half the theatre were drowned out only by the rapturous cheers from the rest.Confetti spilled from the rafters, and I found myself being led down from the stage and along the aisles.Along the way, other apparent team members stretched out their hands, and I high-fived as many as I could.I collapsed into my seat, and finally the spotlights deserted me.I soaked in the relative darkness for a while, glad the attention was off me.Perhaps I could now gain some measure of my bearings.A single chime rung out through the theatre, deep and sonorous.Some people got up to leave, while others stayed in their seats, chatting with their neighbours.The giant screen on the stage lit up with the words: Intermission  Five Minutes.You want to grab a drink or something?Next ones a bit heavy, a soldier in the Russian army, it seems.Might be good to stretch your legs first.

The speaker was the lady on my right.She wore her dark hair in a tidy bob, and was clad in a sensible evening gown.Habit prodded me to introduce myself and to ask for her name, and we shook hands.What are we going to watch? I asked.The life of one Petyr Ivanov, Beth said.The same way we just watched your life unfold, from the very first breath to the last. She laughed at my reaction, then said, Oh dont be a prude.There was nothing in your life that we hadnt seen countless times before.

And when this Petyr has lived out his life, will he come here too?The way I did?

Yes, Beth said.The same for me, and for everyone else here too.Weve all been here a long, long time.

My eyes drifted to the pamphlet I had found in my seat.At the top, I saw Petyrs name, but it was the subsequent part of the title which intrigued me.It says Reincarnation 23,274,899 here are we all the same person, just in different lifetimes? I asked.So are there other theatres out there, for different people?

Not quite, Beth said.I mean, youre right that everyone here is technically the same soul who took turns living on earth, but there are no other theatres.This is it.

That doesnt make sense, I said.Whats so special about us that only we get reincarnated?I mean, there are so many other peo- 

Oh, oh, you misunderstand! Beth laughed.Theres only one soul.One human soul.Its just been split, or copied, I dont know the term, but its the same soul in every living person on earth.

 Just different physical vessels then? I said, turning the possibilities over in my mind.Different circumstances of birth, different living conditions but everyone has the exact same soul?

Yes, Beth said.You catch on quick.

I was quiet for a while.The seconds ticked off the timer on the screen, and the lights began to dim.People streamed back in, holding little bags of what I assumed to be snacks.Whats this Team Blue thing they assigned me to? I asked.Everyone makes choices, see.No one here has ever seen the rules themselves.But weve watched enough to, if you will, kind of guess which Team someone will end up in, based on what they did on earth.Youre one of the good ones.Morals are hard to pin down, every societys got their own interpretations, so it always keeps us on our toes.

I suppose those people are in Team Red then? I said, pointing to the other half of the theatre.Beth nodded.So whats the point of it all then?What happens when we finally finish watching the lives of everyone on earth?What happens when one Team outnumbers the other?

Beth smiled.Hidden projectors whirred to life, and the screen flickered with images of a baby boy, being handed over from a midwife to his mother.The audience clapped, and sporadic shouts of Go Team Blue! and Do Team Red proud emanated from various pockets of the crowd.I suppose then there will be a final reckoning, Beth said.---

Asla had never travelled this far east before.She chose to hike the last stretch of her journey, leaving her beat-up car under a tarpaulin, tucked behind a copse of trees.Nature had beat back mans progress here, and all she had for company were the skittish wildlife, the rush of the waterfalls, the snowflakes cascading down belligerently.Walking rejuvenated her, but more importantly, it gave her a chance to attune her senses, probe for the Folkvarthr, the guardian of the town.She found him perched on a rocky outcrop, just a couple of miles from Seydisfjordur.Asla knew she made no noise, left barely an imprint on the fresh snow beneath her feet, but before such an experienced master, she might as well have been beating a drum, strumming a lyre.Folkvarthr, I come in peace, she said, keeping her distance.She used the honorific so that he would know that she was cut from the same cloth, another member of the ancient clan sworn to protect their country.Underneath her shawl, she gripped her twin knives, priming her defences.It never hurt to be prudent.The older man turned then, and for a moment Asla wondered if the reports were embellished.There was a placid calmness to him, and none of the fire and brimstone she was cautioned about.His eyes, dulled with age, reminded her of the frozen orbs she sometimes had to scrape out of bowls she had left out.I dont recall asking to be relieved, he said.I am not yet battle-weary.I intend to guard this town until I die.

Olafur, you have done us a great service, Asla replied.The records run with the great deeds you have accomplished.You have saved this town more times than anyone can count.You have more than earned your rest.

Olafur scrounged on the ground, picked up a couple of smoothened pebbles.Asla narrowed her eyes, but this time she was over-suspicious  Olafur aimed the small missiles not at her, but at three spots away from them, one to the north and the others to the west.There was but a bleak light still illuminating the valley, so Asla relied instead on her hearing to determine where the pebbles landed.Those are where the rifts are, said Olafur, dusting his palms off.The monsters dont come as often now, but they still can, and they still do.They are different from the ones you deal with back in Reykjavik, or wherever the hell you came from.Nature emboldens them.They dont emerge at night, skulking in the shadows.No, these prefer the day, where they revel in being seen, being feared.Theres a sadism in these parts that only I can handle, young one.

Theres a sadism alright, thought Asla, but instead she said, I will be straightforward, Folkvarthr.This is not a request.The Council has asked that you retire, with immediate effect.

Oh?After all the good work Ive done?

Too good, in fact, said Asla.Reports have come in that you no longer communicate with the town, that you have completely shut yourself off from them.The local children dont even dare come near you anymore, and they have started calling you the Boogeyman, the Reaper.Even worse, the monsters that you slay youre not just putting them down, youre *slaughtering* them.The Council has reason to believe that you-

Olafur chose to move at that moment, streaking in a blur towards highground.Asla was ready, and so she followed closely behind, matching him step for step.She considered the possibility that he was leading her towards a trap, but pushed that thought away.She had to believe that there was humanity yet left in him.Some hundred feet above the ground, a cave opened up alongside the hill, hidden if one were only looking in from the roads.Olafur paused there, then snapped his fingers, bringing to life the candles within.Asla discerned immediately the two urns on one side of the cave, and the heaps of ash on the other.They took my family, was that in your reports too? Olafur asked.I had just saved the town from another invasion, took down no less than three ghouls and two ogres on my own.They come in waves, so I thought we were safe for a while.But they were hiding, down by the waters when my daughter went to swim.My Hansa struggled with them, but she is no practitioner of glima that I am.

In that moment, Asla understood why the Council had chosen her, of all the practitioners, and a tiny bit of the tension in her seeped away.She was not going to die here today, after all.No words can convey my condolences, she said, eventually.Olafur didnt seem to hear.And everyday, everyday I add on to the ashes of my enemies.I think, maybe, when theres enough of it, it will all make sense again, feel right again.

Has it worked?

No, said Olafur, not yet.And that is why I cannot stop, you see?I have to keep going.I have to keep-

Asla lashed out, her knives glinting as they sung through the air.She was not given to surprise attacks, but this was an opponent far more skilled than she was, and she would have to take what the gods of chance gave her.Heck, she had only felled the one ogre in her life, and that was quite an anemic one at that.Olafur caught her blows easily, striking at her wrists, deflecting her attacks.He stepped in, pushed his shoulder against her midriff, then lifted her legs.Asla tensed and recoiled, twisting in the air, landing on her feet.If she fell, it was over.Round and round they went, like marbles in a cone, striking and rebounding, feinting and parrying.At times it seemed that Asla, with her youth and vigor and aggression, had the edge.But Olafur would come back, a crashing fjord of implacable power, brushing her off like a weevil.Then, a slip, as Aslas foot caught on an uneven patch of ground, throwing her off just a couple of inches.Olafur seized the moment, overwhelming her with a deathgrip.Asla kept still, quivering despite her best efforts.She was at his mercy.Why does the Council stop me? he asked, breathing heavily.Can a man not have his revenge?

You are showing signs of taint, Olafur!Do you not see that?In a year, or two, will your bloodlust have calmed?

I am *in control*! he said.Why do you think I have not snapped your neck?

Asla sighed, then relinquished her knives, dropping them to the ground.Olafur had not yet yielded in the face of her surrender, so there was only one course of action left.I bring with me too another message from the Council, she said.Straight from your masters mouth, the same one who assigned you here years ago.He bids me to remind you that you have done your part, that you deserve, at the least, some rest.Any of us can quell the monsters, Olafur, but only you can tend to your wounds.Let Asla carry on your work for you. That is what he said.

Asla waited, and eventually Olafur loosened his hold.She broke free, then turned to assess her opponent.The fight had deserted him, and the hunch in his back, the despair on his brows  there was no more duelling to be had.Olafur averted his gaze, but Asla caught the hint of moistness in his eyes.She she would be around your age, if she were still alive, you know? Olafur said, staring off into the distance.You bastards, she thought.Its not fair sending someone who reminds him of his daughter to fight him.Thats just underhanded.I know, she said.There they sat, as the sun completed its retreat, and the stars reclaimed their fair share of the heavens.From the distance they heard the merriment from the town  preparations were underway for the winter festivals, and Asla sensed that even the monsters would have the decency to stay away this night.Wheres good for dinner? she asked, tentatively.Olafur sighed.I can show you, if you like.

Asla smiled.---

Malters Bridge was one of the most popular suicide spots in the city.It overlooked the Malters River, where the rush of its white waters was a siren song which beckoned droves of jumpers.In response, the authorities had strung reinforced nets along the underbelly of the bridge.Alarms were also scattered liberally about, so that assistance could be summoned the moment anyone tipped over the edge.The Coast Guard even set up a special patrol detail equipped with powerful search lights and automated hooks which could fish the uncooperative out from the freezing waters.For all those reasons, I did *not* choose Malters Bridge as my final destination.Instead, I had picked a nameless spot upriver, where the lack of barriers meant that one could reach the embankment after a short hike through the underbrush.I had shrugged out from my uniform, which was folded neatly upon the ground.My shoes came off next, then my watch, then my service revolver, then the envelope addressed to the department.I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, then began the walk towards the waters.My leg hurt something wicked, but it would all be over soon anyway.Matthew?What are you doing?

I whirled around.The soft glow of moonlight silhouetted her perfectly, but I didnt need to see to know who it was.Her voice, her accent, it wrapped itself around me, sapping away the resolve I was struggling so hard to hold onto.The hell how did you know I was here?

You didnt answer your phone, and I was concerned that-

Jeanne!For goodness sakes, just just go away! My voice, higher and more shrill than I was happy to admit, was on the verge of cracking.I need to do this, OK?Just forget you saw me tonight.Just leave me to do what I need to do.

Need to do?Matthew, what the hell are you talking about?Do you know how ridiculous this is?Youre the bloody hero of the day, and you- 

Dont call me that! I screamed.The rage boiled up in me, rising with the fury of an uncaged bobcat.Dont call me a hero!Im not a hero!Im not a damned, bloody hero!

But you are you saved all of them from the ferry, didnt you?Isnt that what a hero is? Jeanne held up her hands, turning them around briefly so that I could see that she was not hiding anything.She lowered herself to her knees, then sat on the ground.Look, Im not here to tie you up or anything, even though youre doing something god-smackingly stupid.Im just here to listen to you, alright?So why dont you walk back here, away from the water, and tell me just tell me what the *hell* is going through that thick skull of yours?

Youre not my partner right now, OK?This this isnt work.This isnt the bloody precinct!

But I just have to know, Matthew.We were doing so well, werent we?Persevering from one clue to the next, and then we were on the tail of the Red Mist himself!He was on the same damned ferry as us!We were that close to him!

The Red Mist I looked down, and realized my fists had curled up at the very mention of the name.A cackle escaped from me, which gained steam until the tears were streaming down my cheeks.The hundreds of hours poured into chasing him down, into studying every single lead which crossed our desks, into stakeouts all across the city it suddenly seemed all so *petty*.What was the point of being able to apprehend the worst serial killer the city had ever seen, when my hands were not clean themselves?It was all a trap, you know.Right from the start.He had the sleeping gas rigged to go off throughout the ferry.

I know, Jeanne said.But that is what the Red Mist does.We knew the risks, but we had to do it still.

Only because we believed it was the best chance we had at catching him!It was the only reliable intel weve had in years!And look at what we ended up with!He slipped away again, and over a dozen people drowned... for what?A chance to get close to him?

Matthew you know *everyone* could have drowned if it wasnt for you.If you hadnt taken control of the situation, gave the right orders at the right time, more than a dozen could have-

I shook my head.The lies had gone on long enough.It was all going to end tonight.Listen, Jeanne.Theres something I didnt tell the Chief, or any of the reporters.I didnt wake up on the deck.I was in one of the recreation rooms.I caught a glimpse of the Red Mist, just before he closed the door.

You did? Jeannes eyes glinted in the dark.What did he look like?

I I couldnt really see.Not tall, around your height, maybe.But thats not the point.He had his mask on, anyway.See, I wasnt alone in the room.There were others there too, a dozen of them, elderly folk who looked like they had just been plucked out from a nursing home.All of them, asleep, one of them with her bridge cards still in her hands!

Jeanne was anything but slow.I watched the understanding creep across her face, like dusk stealing across the horizon.The ones who drowned?

Yes!The Red Mist had them all tied down.Locks upon locks, knots upon knots.A heap of keys on the floor.He even had a card there, left for me to discover.Save these or save the rest?

You sure thats what he wrote?

I couldnt understand it too.Why not just kill them with that dagger of his?Reduce them all to nothing but vaporized blood?Why go to all the trouble of immobilizing an entire ferry, then giving me stupid games to play?Thats when it dawned upon me, Jeanne.He wasnt there to kill me.He was there to *break* me. I turned back towards the Malters River.The tide was rising, and though I hadnt taken a step since, the waters were lapping around my ankles.Im done, Jeanne.Go find someone else to take down the Red Mist.I I cant sleep anymore, you know.All I see are their faces.Waiting for me to wake them up, to free them

You did what you had to, said Jeanne.If you didnt choose so many more would have died.Dont you see that?Its the greater good!

So why then did I leave that out of my report! I roared.Why was I ashamed of the choice I made?Was I afraid of being judged?Could I even have brought myself to look at their families, and to tell them how I chose to abandon them?I cant, Jeanne!Im not a bloody, *damned* hero!Im just Im just damned you have to let me go now, Jeanne.I have to do this.I have to go.

She didnt stop me this time.The catharsis spread through me, churning with the cold to summon the goosebumps to my flesh.I had gotten far enough for the waters to reach my knees when I heard her speak again, her voice somehow cutting through the winds billowing about me.You remember the legend behind the Red Mist, dont you?

I did.It wasnt something I would likely forget anytime soon.The Red Mist doesnt kill wantonly, despite what the media would have you believe.Theres a hidden pattern to his attacks, a twisted meaning to the way he chooses his victims.Its easy to dismiss him as just another sadist so discontent with his own life that he purposely picks off the very best amongst us, in some demented way of reducing the overall *quality* of those left behind.

The Misunderstood Savior theory? I asked.Its nothing but a toxic byproduct of all the sick minds who worship him.They think he is killing so that he can deliver them unto an unspoiled earth, one that will steer clear of the destruction awaiting ours.Its nonsense, all of it.

Just imagine, Matthew.Indulge me, with those last few seconds of your life.Imagine if the Red Mist truly had an enchanted blade, and was truly capable of sending all those people away to a parallel Earth.That would line up nicely with the victim reports, yes?Neatly distributed across all backgrounds, all occupations, all specializations in just the right proportions to repopulate the planet?

Jeanne, please dont tell me that youre buying into that crap.If this is a ploy to make me come back up and take back the investigation from you, then youve got- 

*Listen*, Matthew!Across all the victims, did you ever see any politicians?Any leaders?Anyone who could conceivably lead a hypothetical group of people stranded in that parallel dimension, bereft of any semblance of leadership?

Politicians?Hah!If only the Red Mist would do us the favor of taking a few of our leaders away from us.

Have you ever considered, asked Jeanne, that the Red Mist is now looking for those people who can make the toughest of decisions?Those amongst us who shy away from power, and yet are capable of rising to the occasion when needed?Who can focus on the greater good, without wavering, and who can make the best of a shitty, *shitty* situation?

I turned, and was just in time to see Jeanne leap up from her sitting position.That was impressive in and of itself, but the way she danced across the uneven ground, the way she propelled herself towards me, the way she practically *skipped* across the surface of the water... she was a silky shadow, flitting effortlessly through the space between us.In her right hand was a curved dagger, its edge impossibly bright.The reflection of the moonlight off its polished surface left streaks burning in my eyes.See you on the other side, she said.I never even felt the slash across my throat.---

The rebellion began in Sector 17.It wasn't that the demons overseeing that specific district were in any way particularly lax or incompetent.In fact, they were tormenting the humans assigned to them with just as much fervor and commitment as the other demons across the plains of Hell.The same incentives, the same *disincentives*, the same applications of magical and demonic force to maximize human suffering with the minimum of fuss.A dam that is strong everywhere, is strong nowhere.The spark which birthed the conflagration came in one of the torture pits, which seethed continuously with boiling oil.One of the humans, with his ankles chained to the bottom, doomed to struggle for escape eternally, had stayed submerged for longer than usual.The other humans tittered at this, and their cheers soon brought their captors running.Once the first demon leaned in too close for a better look, outstretched hands pulled it right in.The demon had flailed out in the ensuing struggle, and though it succeeded in reducing most around it to mere ribbons, still others managed to escape the pit in large enough chunks to make a difference.Reinforcements had poured in then, of course.They were armed to the fangs - scarlet magma armor, claws steeped in paralytic poisons, tridents of flame at the ready.They weren't enough.How could they be, when they faced not disparate, wretched souls, but amalgams of horror which matched their superiors for sheer ferocity?For the souls which escaped the pits had begun to *work in unison*.They streamed out of the pit in an unending flow of anger and resentment.Unshackled not just from the metaphysical chains of their prison, they had also been given their first taste of  true freedom from the limits which they had known their entire existences.The humans congregating on the left half of the pit, for example, were cheering as dark webs of sorcery encircled them, making them whole where seconds ago they were not.At first, they sounded as if they were speaking in tongues.A mish-mash of languages.But the more perceptive of the demons soon realised that their former prisoners were invoking the collective weight of every form of spellcasting known to mankind.How could they have managed to amass the know-how, the capability?The ones on the right presented as significant a threat.They were not channeling any arcane forces, but still they were rising out of the pit in fury, pushing back the demons which opposed them.Their means of persuasion soon became clear - they had melded with the corrupted metals which floated on the oil like fetid scum.Crude boxes of unrefined ore, evidently fashioned in darkness away from prying eyes, were affixed to the backs of these soldiers, and the boxes hummed and crackled with electricity.Had science actually managed a Renaissance in this most hostile of environments?The demons sent to investigate the ruins of Sector 17 eventually discovered how the humans had managed their feats.It appeared that one of the classic forms of torture had been subverted, completely upended.Soul disintegration involved the grinding of a human's sentience into fine crystals, whereupon the human would experience pain and suffering for centuries as the powders slowly reformed.The blasted humans had learned how to *communicate* through these crystalline motes, engaging, coordinating with each other across the expanses of Hell using nothing more than the shambles of their former brethren.It was too late by then, of course.The human armies swept across Hell with a fury that only the oppressed could ever wield.Demons, prepared for unruliness but not for coordinated assaults on their rule, yielded territory in larger and larger swathes till they were themselves holed up in one of their last bastions, a darkened spire at the very center of Hell.As the hordes of rebels massed around them, harnessing the combined might of magic and science, Lucifer unsealed a chest woven together with bone.From within, he retrieved a pearlescent horn, which had streaks of ebony running through it from its time in Hell.He placed it to his lips, then blew.The discordant note rang out, streaking upwards towards the angels which had been looking down in increasing dismay.The barriers which separated the two provinces cleaved wide open as the note surged past them."Help," Lucifer said, uttering words he had never thought he would."Please."---

Adam Kinsley awoke to a nightmare.The adrenaline pumped so hard that the blood sang in his ears.He rubbed his eyes, pinched himself, then distractedly struck his alarm clock off the nightstand in an effort to silence it, but still the images remained.He took deep breaths, then reached for the phone by his bed.Maybe talking to somebody would break the spell, he thought.Jenny? he said, after the second ring.Adam?What the its 7.30 AM!Are you still at home?

Just wanted to check, you know, if I was dreaming.

Dreaming?Have you been drinking?Its Tuesday!You better not be hungover!The September presentations today!Jesus!Get your ass to the office!

The phone slipped from Adams hand.He was a born salesman, able to talk the ear off anyone who would listen, but he somehow couldnt find the right words to describe how a sea of spiders had blanketed his apartment ceiling, covering it from edge to edge in black, furry, chitinous carapaces.He wondered briefly if this had anything to do with the spiders he had been rescuing and setting free.He never saw the point in killing them, not when they were harmless and kept other pests away, but he had also never knew they would infest in this manner.Regret and anger swirled into a potent cocktail, clouding his mind.This is how you repay me?When its the most important day of my career so far? he said, as he slid from his bed, inching towards the door.My landlords going to kill me, you know that right?

Fresh horrors awaited him in the living room.All points of exit were swathed in what appeared to be layers of cobwebs, and the morning sun streamed but weakly through the swaddled windows.Adam turned as he heard the scurrying of a million legs behind him, and barely held up his hands in time to ward off a stream of spiders flying through the air, erupting towards him.What the hell! Adam cried, as he lost his footing and fell.He expected to connect hard with the teak floors, but instead he bounced off a freshly-woven coat webbing, cocooning him.He flexed, but he barely made any headway.A chittering filled his ears, and he had to fight from opening his mouth to scream.Please, he whispered, the tears filling his eyes.I never hurt any of you, I always watched out for you.Why is this happening to me?I just want to go to work, forget any of this happened!Please, please

The webbing soon covered him fully, though the spiders left just enough space for him to breathe through and to peer out from.He lay on the ground, facing the television.He wriggled, tried to get away, but he could not move.He tried to scream too, but no one heard him.His prison was complete.Then, stretching his belief to the point of breaking, he saw a single spider, triple the size of those around it, dangle down from the ceiling, swinging closer to the television.The other spiders moved away from it, giving it the space it needed.The queen then extended a single leg, then activated and turned the television on.The news channel logo flashed briefly on the screen, before cutting to a newscaster on the streets of New York.Adam recognised first the deli in the background, then the street signs, then the building in the background of the shot.The familiarity was unmistakable, especially after he had worked at the same place for years.He could even imagine himself there, at the scene, already reporting for work like any other day at his office on the 110th level, were it not for the sudden infestation of arachnids.Reports are just coming in, said the newscaster, the panic and worry etched clearly on her face.There appears to be an explosion on the north tower, over 100 floors up.Eyewitnesses say that, and Im having trouble believing this myself, but they say that a plane, yes, a plane

2 February, 2067.The massive computer filled the laboratory, a mass of cables and circuitry which towered over Dr Dane Langley.His team had already adjourned to the pub off-campus to celebrate their success, but Dr Langley wanted a quiet moment with his creation before the government took control of the project the next day."Rachel," he said, "compile index for me, Dr Dane Langley.""Compiling in process," repeated the computer.Electricity thrummed in the air as a trillion lines of codes extended their tentacles across the world for the information Dr Langley sought.Rachel was only the name they used to impart a smidgen of personality into the program, and what a benign name it was for such a monstrous creation!What Rachel was designed to do was to build a comprehensive report of a person, using information culled from every conceivable electronic source.Privacy groups had long campaigned for the individual's right to privacy, and there was such widespread support for them in this hyperconnected age that Dr Langley had to proceed in the utmost secrecy.If it were even known that he had embarked on this journey, he would surely be publicly lynched."Compiling complete.Do you wish to view your index?""Yes," said Dr Langley."Sort by contributions to my life."A hologram of a bookshelf formed in the air, a collection of motes of light frozen like trapped lightning.A single book spun out from its niche, twirling to reveal Dr Langley's name embossed on the front.For that was what Rachel was - an incomparable librarian, able to instil order in the chaos of information, to bring together infinite threads of knowledge into cohesive tomes.In other words, Rachel could index any person's entire life, in real time, and present it as a single book of references.No one escaped her gaze, no one was spared her scrutiny."Sorting complete.""Scroll... scroll... scroll..." 

Dr Langley marvelled at the accuracy of the Indexing.These were the most important people in his life, the ones who impacted him the most.From his parents, to the professors who guided his education, to the politicians who recognised the value of the tool he had promised to fashion.Then, a whim seized him."Sort by least contributions instead," he said, as a grin crossed his face."I want to see where my ex-wife ranks.""...Sorting complete."Dr Langley laughed, for there was his ex-wife's name, about twenty ranks from the very bottom.She was just above Perlo, a name he recognised as the grocery bagger he crossed paths with occasionally, and just below Martha, the parking attendant at the campus grounds.Out of the corner of his eye, one name snagged his attention, the way a single burr does to fine cotton shirts."Rachel, stop.Go back.Back again.Yes, there.Who is... who is ERROR 52?Is that a name?""Yes, it is a name.""No, Rachel.What I mean is, is that a real entry or is it... a bug?Why does it only say that I once passed Error 52 on the street, and I grumbled at how Error 52 was in my way?""... Self diagnosis complete.I do not have any bugs in this current version," said Rachel."I want you to Index Error 52 then," said Dr Langley.A tiny flower of dread bloomed in him - if the program were indeed faulty, it would mean weeks, months of corrections before he could hand off the project."Index Error 52 fully, I want to see who this person is.""... Indexing complete.""Scroll... scroll... scro-" 

The command died on his lips as the information in the hologram burned their way into his eyes."This is impossible!"he said."Rachel, who is this entity Error 52?Why are there so many accounts of him... or her... helping me?""Because those accounts are true, Dr Langley.In 2017, when you were born, Error 52 was there to manually regulate the incubator and to prevent you from overheating.A technician had missed the faulty wiring which would have led to you overheating, and quite possibly dying.""But... how would he... or she..." 

"In 2023," said Rachel, who if she had possessed feelings would have been slightly miffed still at the implication that she was faulty."Error 52 was there to honk at a driver who was drunk and who had not seen you cycling across the street.My probability analysis shows that you may have perished otherwise, flattened under two tons of steel.""In 2028..." 

"In 2035..."

"In 2044..."

Dr Langley sat motionless, long after Rachel had finished reciting the dozen and one ways he could have died.It was not accurate to say that his mind was a blank - rather, it was a firework festival of neurons, as he delved into the infinite possibilities.But the answer eluded him."Rachel," he said, finally."Who is Error 52?Why can I not see his or her name?Where is he... or she...now?""I cannot answer in the way you have queried," said Rachel."What do you mean?Are you lacking information?How can that be?I have given you the world!"Rachel was quiet for a moment before she replied."I cannot answer because you used the wrong syntax.Error 52 is not one man or one woman.It is a group, a collective, of people.Please rephrase your question, and try again."---

The wind is whipping against my hair, carrying away the billows of smoke escaping my mouth, lashing a silent rebuke in my ears.My hovercar is the only one on the highway, cruising at 200 miles to nowhere.I pull hard on my cigarette as the first holo-ad materializes in the distance, having identified me personally.KENNETH STETTER, the hologram reads as it beams into my eyes, WOULDNT YOU RATHER BE ELIGIBLE FOR LIFE EXTENSION?YOU COULD IF YOU QUIT SMOKING!I allow a faint smile to lightly touch my lips.No, I think to myself.Im quite done with this life, and if the nanomachines did not prevent me from ending my own life more quickly, I may not even be reading this now.My finger stabs the dashboard controls, and my hovercar doubles in speed, blazing down the highway.The cigarette framed between my fingers threatens to be carried away by the turbulence, but I hold on, as tightly as I can.KENNETH STETTER, the second hologram a few miles on begins, SOCIETY WOULD WELCOME YOU BACK IF YOU RENOUNCED CONTROL OVER YOUR WIFES TOBACCO COMPANY.DO YOU NOT WANT TO BE AROUND PEOPLE AGAIN?My face is numb, my hands are aching, but a fire burns within me.Give it up?Give up the one thing which brought my wife and I together, as we fought to keep the company alive even whilst all the others were shuttering their doors one by one?Relinquish the one facility left in this country which could produce compact little hits of heaven, just for me?The third hologram, perhaps sensing my petulant resolution to double down, went for my jugular.I had known there was public pressure to eradicate smoking entirely from our society, but this

KENNETH STETTER, it said, forcefully payloading its message into my brain via aged eyes too slow to turn away, IF THE TWO OF YOU HAD NOT SMOKED THAT NIGHT, MAYBE SHE WOULD STILL BE HERE?The tears cloud my vision, flowing up from a blackened heart I had thought was no longer capable of such tender emotions.The guilt I had learned to tame over troubled decades of infighting calls to me, from over the horizon, as it whispers in cruel lilting tones, reminding me that they never agreed on the exact cause of the fire.And in that moment, I consider flicking the cigarette to the flowing streams of asphalt below, chucking the cartons carrying its cousins over as well.but then the aroma, the honeyed smoke, wafts into my nostrils, and the pungent scent dredges up precious memories, transporting me back to those years ago of long drives with her, holding her as she laughed in my arms, of lying in bed afterwards when she would sleep and I would sidle up close, just us, two of us, drunken in our euphoria of being with each other

I cant recall her face anymore, or her voice, and on some days, even her name.Time has taken those away from me.Yet, I feel her next to me, just as it was, as it should be, whenever the lovingly rolled tobacco yields its jealously-hoarded secrets to the searing flames, and the smell, the smell of her, envelopes me.The fourth, fifth, six holograms down the road come to life, carrying messages designed to cut, to provoke, to push me to drop the last cigarette.But Ill never do that.My lungs extract the last of my cigarette, and as it turns to ash, dissolving in the currents swirling by me, Im already lighting another.Down the highway, the neverending highway, my hovercar streams.---

The initial plans called for a phalanx of special forces to accompany Jamie  two to flank his side, another forty-eight to encircle the sprawling mansion in the upperclass suburbs, all with strict orders to contain any disturbance with extreme prejudice.Jamie had finally convinced his bosses to see things his way.Look, I was the one who brought her in, I can get her to cooperate.Even if she reacts unexpectedly, Jamie had said, tapping the vest they had fitted over him, Ill be able to handle it with this, right?

Eventually, only one other agent was assigned, and even he was left to stand watch at the end of the long driveway, nervously peering into the darkness as Jamie crossed the lawn, alone, to rap sharply on the ornate mahogany door.You promised me I would be left alone, hissed the voice, bouncing around sharply in the confines of Jamies skull.Lwellyn, you have no idea the lengths Ive gone to keep you safe, growled Jamie, a note of irritation creeping into his voice.It was true, and righteous indignation swirled in his belly, which he fought to suppress.But I am one lone man, trying to make the best of a right shitshow, so forgive me if you are to be disturbed.

The door swung open on its own, and the dcor within was as Jamie expected of a designer who, having been forbidden to use her favourite colours or motifs, had suddenly been set free to do as she would.In other words, there was running water, everywhere.An arresting fountain took centre-stage in the hall, bubbling as the water jets twirled and spun gracefully in the air.Two double-storey waterfalls, cleverly-designed waterspouts from on high, gushed into swirling pools.Streams of water, chugging along inset rivulets, ran across the length of the floor.Lwellyn snapped her fingers, and suddenly, all the water ceased.They did not stop, in the way that one may expect if a tap were turned off.Rather, all the water froze where they were, transfixed in motion, as if it were all a streaming video which was in the midst of buffering.Lwellyn saw the look in Jamies eyes, and said, Ive been here ten years, Jamie, and still I cannot believe your Homeworld takes for granted what we struggle so hard to replace.So forgive me my indulgences.

Oh no, I suppose I would have done the same thing, said Jamie, a wistful edge to his tone, Every inch of my home would be filled with every trinket, vessel or embodiment of Magic I could lay my hands on.I understand the allure of what we do not have, Lwellyn, very well.

It was somewhat ironic that even though Jamie was the leader of the global think-tank which specialized in advising world governments on trans-world relations, he had never personally crossed over into any of the other Homeworlds.He was intimately aware that crossing over was safe, that one only had to prepare the necessary substitutes  for example, Lwellyns Homeworld, Dessicae, possessed the elements of Earth, Air, Fire and Magic in abundance, but Water was notably absent, so that had to be brought along.Early forays had determined that it was Magic which had, in a sense, adapted to help Dessicae survive despite the absence of Water.Magic was intangible, omnipotent, and it flowed so richly in Dessicae that it filled in all the roles which Water would normally have played on Jamies Homeworld.Subsequent reports confirmed that it was the same on the other Homeworlds  regardless of which element was missing on that Homeworld, Magic was the glue which bound them all together.It was only on Jamies Homeworld, where Earth, Air, Fire and Water were all present and accounted for, that Magic had, perhaps deciding that it had no role to play, slinked away.This cannot be a courtesy call, said Lwellyn, eyes narrowing, I am indebted to you, but not once since you took me in as a refugee have you ever called on me in a personal capacity.It has always been about work, and this cannot be different.

You are astute, and I shall be blunt then.Ive come to ask for you to unlock the Portal to your Homeworld.

Jamies request hung in the air, and eventually Lwellyn laughed.You must be joking.How do you expect me to be able to do tha-

We will inform Dessicae that we have finally hunted you down, rooted you out from your hiding place amongst our populace.You will return a political prisoner, but our operatives will be in place to spring you out.We just need you, as a native, to weave the spells needed to fully open the Portal to Dessicae.Once that is done, your debt is clear, and you can return here to live out the rest of your life in peace. 

And why the hell would I do that?

Jamie had anticipated this question.He had two answers prepared, the first being an appeal to logic.He would show Lwellyn the collected data, that the four elements in Jamies Homeworld were irreversibly poisoned, and that open channels were needed to the other Homeworlds so that the tainted elements could be replaced.Negotiations for peaceful acquisition of resources were stalling, and time was running out.From that perspective, the problem was suddenly a matter of national, nay, global security.And to round off the logical explanation, Jamie would have pointed out that when it came down to a matter of global security, a certain amount of force was allowed, and the opening of the Portals was the first step to a policy they had termed Enforced Survival.But Lwellyn was not susceptible to logical arguments, as Jamies memory served him, so instead he said, We have reason to believe your daughter is alive in Dessicae.These photographs were taken just last month.You wont just be helping your adopted Homeworld survive, you will be bringing your daughter home.

Jamies hands were already on his vest, and his personal Barrier was activated mere seconds before Lwellyns psychic scream tore through the mansion.Part guilt for abandoning the child she thought had died all those years ago, part anguish for not doing more, part shame for moving on when her own flesh and blood still suffered in Dessicae, the Magic spilled out of Lwellyn, a malevolent manifestation of her pain.Outside, a hundred feet away, the special agent crumpled to his knees, grabbing his head in pain.The hidden gears and circuits in Jamies vest toiled on, shielding him more than adequately.Jamie gave the woman, sobbing poignantly on the floor, a full minute before he pressed his case.Will you help us open the Portal?I have three others like you to meet tonight, Lwellyn, and I really need an answer.

The angry, determined *hungry* look in her eyes was all the answer he needed.---

The Devil had a near infinite capacity for patience.That was a different thing from saying that the Devil never got testy or annoyed from having to bide his time  the Devil understood that there were things worth waiting for, like the gradual corruption of the most pious men and women, or the inevitable collapse of Heaven.Mostly, though, no one liked to keep the Devil waiting, and so things had a tendency to work themselves out neatly.Penelope Milsson, though, was really pushing the envelope here.You do know that when I summon you, I *expect* you to come to my office *immediately*? 

But I did, Boss, said Penelope, as she furrowed her brow in recollection.I heard the bleating of the goat-horns over the PA, so I dropped all that I was doing, and then I rushed along to meet-

And you do know that I can *see* you throughout Hell, right? said the Devil, a mercurial hint of exasperation in his voice.I was looking at you at this screen right here the whole time!You took your own sweet time to log off your terminal, then you stopped by the canteen for a pudding, *then* you popped by HR *before* you came here!Do you also have explanations for those?

The Devil had to give Penelope credit  she barely missed a beat.Oh Boss, you know the promise I made to you when I first came to Hell?When you offered me this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?I told you I would always make the job my first priority, and I meant every word of it!You couldnt have expected me to believe that you were actually instructing me to *defy* you, yes?That wouldnt have made any sense at all, wouldnt you agree?

Penelopes smile was beatific, so much so that the Devil wanted to sink his claws right into her insufferable expression.But she was right.It was poor form to punish her for his oversight.Besides, beating up on Hells Star Employee of the Year was just poor optics no matter how the Devil looked at it.We will discuss again the manner in which you manage your priorities, said the Devil.For now, theres something a bit more urgent at hand.Whats this I hear about the plummeting morale in the Hellish Fiend and Craven Demon departments?

Morale is plummeting? said Penelope, her mouth agape and a hand on her chest for emphasis.In those departments?Surely that cannot be?They are the cream of the crop, yes?

They are blaming *you*, in fact.They have specifically named one Miss Penelope Milsson, 35 years of age at the time of passing, for  let me quote them directly  *destroyeth the naturale orders of the Underworld with unnaturale and cruele and unusuale means of punishment for the piggies known as Humans*. The Devil paused here, then fixed a gleaming red eye on Penelope.You have anything to say about that?

Well, it is a bit rich, aint it, said Penelope.I mean, they are the ones with the whips and the fangs and the claws and they are accusing *me* of being sadistic?

The Devil sighed.He felt the tiny drumming of an incipient migraine start up in the frontal lobes of his brain.I told you time and again, yes?Just do what all your predecessors have done.Just beat the humans.Boil them.Flay them.Dont rock the boat, just stick to the script.How hard can that be?Is that too much to ask?

Penelope crossed her arms, and a mutinous glint entered her eyes.Have I ever let you down, Boss?Have my numbers ever proven my methods wrong?

The numbers are good, its just that-

And did you not clap me on the back, right on stage and in front of your infernal hordes, when you gave me the Trident for Employee of the Year?Did you not point out how I was a sterling example of what all creatures should strive to be?Did you not wax lyrical over the bleedin innovation I brought to this fine establishment?

Yes, I did, I did do all that, said the Devil, who vaguely felt like he was losing control of the conversation.All Im asking is that- 

The results dont lie, Boss!Look!Look at your precious screen!Once word got out of how truly *nasty* it is in Hell now, theres been a significant and quantifiable uptick in good behavior on Earth!A dozen new splinter religions have been established, just so that more of the fringe believers can be routed off to Heaven!I even brought you the internal circular they were sending around Up Above, yes?The one where they said that dear old Lucifer has never ran as tight a ship as he is doing now, do you remember?

The Devil sighed again.He did remember.It was a nice feeling, to know that there were others who were once again giving him the due respect and recognition he deserved.He was the one who had picked out Penelope from the masses anyway, who had first sniffed out her talents and then took her under his wings.Which, of course, only made this meeting all the more awkward.Look, all Im asking is, dont be such a bloody show-off, said the Devil.You know how the Hellish Fiends and Craven Demons are.They are *old*.They cant change their ways as fast as you can.Stop showing them up and making them unhappy.

And whats wrong with a little natural selection? asked Penelope.Its not my fault they are so tethered to the old ways.Would it hurt if they just spent a little effort studying how they can maximize suffering with the minimal amount of effort?

They have whips! said the Devil.And they have claws!Thats about it!What else do you expect of them!I give them humans, they torture them with their immortal instruments, and thats it!Thats the end of the story!

Not good enough, sniffed Penelope.Not good enough.As I told you during my interview, I think my time at retail has given me the sort of training your Horde has never had.Do you know what separates the best retail workers from the scum?Its understanding the human condition, thats all it is.You dont believe me?

I dont see what relevance that has to anyth- 

If you dont understand your customers, how can you expect to serve their every need? said Penelope, a train without any brakes whatsoever.I was forced to pick up the smallest mannerisms, study the slightest inflections, just so I could know what sort of customer I was dealing with.When I was alive, I was the best, bar none.A woman could walk in and I would know if she was shopping for herself, her girlfriends, her significant other or her child.I could pacify the gnarliest children, I could entertain the grumpiest grandparents.There was no one else quite like me.And I will give you the answer you have been looking for.

Before the Devil could object, Penelope stood and whipped out a folder she had been hiding behind her back.The smug smile on her face unsettled the Devil more than he would admit.Whats this now? asked the Devil.The reason why the other departments are complaining.They are achieving an ROI of only about 50% - thats 1 unit of human suffering for every 2 units of effort.My department?Well, were up to an ROI of 200%.Yes, you heard that right.Were *four times* more efficient than they are.For every unit of effort we sink in, we extract 2 units of suffering.Two, whole, units!

The Devil took a deep breath, then opened the folder as gingerly as he would have if he was handling a vat of holy water.The words did not make sense at first, but the pictures certainly helped.A fine bead of sweat broke out on his brow as understanding set in.You asked all sufferers to indicate whether they wished to be with their parents?And when they answered yes, you put them with their parents *in-law*?

Not my fault that they were not specific, said Penelope, a grin on her face.And when any sufferers begged to be reunited with their children, you agreed without telling them that you would be returning to them the six-month-old versions of their children?

Again, not my fault, said Penelope.Time has a different meaning here, yes?

And when they asked to meet again with the loves of their lives, you returned their very first crushes to them?And you played recordings of all the things they did to woo said first crushes?

Penelope bared her teeth in her widest grin yet.Im particularly proud of that one.Seems like no matter how old people get, they never forget the embarrassment of those early years.And theres more too.People who are fussy get prison cells which are slightly off-proportions, people who are vain get zit outbreaks every morning, people who love dogs get cats as companions the list goes on.And on.And on.Ive got a few more folders, just like those.

The Devil slammed the folder back onto the table, the steam rising from his forehead.He cricked his neck, then forced himself to speak again.It was always hard to back-pedal.How about I make a recommendation for you to ascend to Up Above, the Devil said.On account of your brilliance and such.Hells no place for you.

Oh not, not yet, said Penelope.Ive not accomplished my goals.

And which are?

Easy, Penelope said as she began to rise.I wont leave until I get Employee of the Century.Its a personal pride thing, I hope you understand.

"You sure we won't get in trouble?"asked Kaaboom, nervously picking at his collar."I mean, I'm still on probation, you know.Can't afford to get written up on any more of them charges.""There's no crime if it's for a good purpose," said Vorlax, who as No.42 on the League's most wanted list, really was the last person anyone should be taking legal advice from."Besides, I'm the one with the dummy explosives here, so Chronotron's going to be focusing fully on me.You ready?"The two supervillains took a deep breath, then pushed their way to the centre of the crowded town square.Vorlax hopped onto a bench, threw open his trenchcoat, revealing a neat array of sausages, tightly wrapped in brown paper.The alarm clock which Kaaboom had helped tape to the front dangled precariously."Screw all of you!Damn you all to hell!See ya all in the afterlife, muthaf-"

Vorlax never got to finish his threat.Even before the gathered crowd could react, even before the first screams could rend the air, he had already frozen in place, encased in a shimmering cage of writhing chrono-filaments.Hot damn, thought Kaaboom, so this is what it looks like from the outside.Enthused clapping rang out as the citizenry acknowledged yet another successful rescue by the hero known as Chronotron, the League's newest poster boy.He hovered in the air, waving at his adoring fans."Fear not, one and all, the threat has been neutralised!It's off to the gallows for this one!""Wait, wait!"shouted Kaaboom, remembering the part he had to play.They had flipped a coin for this, because it was never fun to have to explain to the League what they were really up to, plus it wasn't easy suppressing the instinct to run, an instinct they had honed their entire careers."Wait, Chronotron!I can explain everything!"The darkening scowl from Chronotron made it clear to Kaaboom that he had only a very short window of opportunity."Kaaboom?You caught up in this terrorist attack too?""No, no!Wait, I mean yes!But not in that way, those aren't explosives at all, I swear!Just sausages!From the deli opposite!"Chronotron stretched a hand into the chronocage, poking tentatively.His scowl deepened as his finger pierced into the soft mushiness of a bratwurst."If this is a joke, Kaaboom, it is in bad taste.Causing undue public alarm is also a crime!""We needed to get to you urgently, that's all!And the League wouldn't take any of our calls, our numbers are all blacklisted!Please, just a minute of your time, in private!"Chronotron snapped his fingers, and a larger chronocage extended to envelop the two of them.Outside the bubble, the world ground to a halt."55 seconds remain, Kaaboom, before I'm hauling both you and Vorlax in.""Right, right!See, we think something's happened to Vortex Man, and just in case he needs help urgently, we thought, you know, your powers would come in handy!I swear, that's the truth!"A puzzled frown spread across Chronotron's face."Vortex Man?Why would anything happen to him?He's been retired for years!""Well, see...There's this roster we have, all the ones who have been given second chances by him before.We take turns to check in on him, just to make sure the old boy's getting on well..."

"How would you know where he lives anyway?His identity's still a secret!"Kaaboom thrust a sheaf of papers at Chronotron, and said, "We don't, but look, we know his routine, where he goes for his daily walk, where he gets his coffee... And we take turns staging kidnappings, or hold ups, just so that he has a bit of exercise, you know?We think it keeps him happy, being relevant and appreciated and all..."

The first time he had been asked to assist, Kaaboom had drawn the short straw, so the role of a desperate mugger went to him.He had come away from the encounter shaken, not so much because Vortex Man still packed a mean punch, but because he had truly aged, now a mere shadow of the strapping superhero who had first apprehended Kaaboom on the streets so many years ago.The sheen to Vortex Man's once thick, lustrous hair was gone, and a certain pallidness clung to his skin like shame to an introvert.His mind too, frail and feeble, couldn't recognise Kaaboom even though he played a kidnapper, then a rapist, then a mugger again, three days in a row.Heck, Kaaboom even had to pretend to be a cat in a tree once, after Vorlax suggested that variety would help keep Vortex Man nimble.Kaaboom didn't mind helping out more, especially after the other supervillains started excusing themselves from the roster, citing the poor economy, the need to find work in other cities, family commitments... there were fewer and fewer of them on the roster, which meant that some weeks, Kaaboom and Vorlax did double, triple duties.After all, the way that Vortex Man brightened up every time he helped someone... that was enough for Kaaboom to want to come back again, the very next day.Chronotron flipped through the papers, understanding slowly dawning on him."And I take it, he hasn't turned up today?""Yes, you get it now!Nothing!We've been on Evil.net, and no one else has seen or heard from him in two days!So we thought, he's been pretty regular with his schedule, and for him to suddenly not turn up..."

If there was one thing Kaaboom had to give Chronotron credit for, it was that he truly had the gumption and decisiveness of a first-class hero.Chronotron handed back the papers, raised both arms in the sky, and shouted as the chronocage grew, slowly at first, then faster, and larger, till it stretched further than the eye could see.Now, nothing moved, except for the two of them."Come, then, let's go.I have a rough idea of where he stays.If there is any medical emergency, this should buy us some time till we can get help to him.""Err... Chronotron, if you don't mind, could we get Vorlax to come too?This was his idea after all..."

Chronotron laughed, then inclined his head ever so slightly."...uckas!"---

The War Councils table was large enough to comfortably seat ten, which meant that the four of them had ample space between them.They waited patiently for Vorporl to usher the last of the attendants out, unfurl the banners outside which read War Council In Session, then shutter the heavy wooden doors.Are you sure they cant hear us from outside? asked Groggzor, with his grip still firmly around his war-axe.What kind of genie do you take me for? Vorporl said, as he swirled in a purple cloud back to the head of the table.This be the third such session, Warchief, and no spy has yet uncovered what it is we do here.

They had better not, said Curllex, as she drummed her long, deformed digits on the table.I come here at great risk, and my people still think I am here to fan the flames of war.Even the lowest goblin will rise up against me if they knew the truth.

Not just you, not just you, said Nymae, her voice hushed by the dark cowl which perpetually shrouded her features.I hold much sway yet over the night elves, but tis would beggar belief.I risk just as much as anyone here.

Nefatim, surly as always, merely nodded, concentrating as he did on animating the rat skeleton before him.Time slips by so fleetingly, said Vorporl, as he clapped his hands.Welcome back, my friends, to yet another heart-stilling, pulse-stopping, mind-numbing session of the greatest decadence.It is, once again, the moment for you to cast your minds back to that rift we tore, those glimpses of a world we saw and play *Serene Suburbia*, a campaign like no other, set in the mystical world of *Suburbs and SUVs*

Vorporl concentrated, and turned purple briefly as the magic spilled out of him, washing over the table, his guests, the chamber, spinning an illusion so complete that even Nymae had difficulty piercing through the veil.Character sheets?

The four of them nodded conspiratorially as they thumped the sheafs of parchments before them.There was a fifth amongst them once, long ago, but Vorporl had not taken kindly to the kobold knights habit of being forgetful.Vorporl was an Ancient Antiquity, with vast reserves of magic at his command, and it had not taken much to reduce the offender to dust.No one ever forgot their character sheets after.Everyone even volunteered to bring extra dice.Good, good, said Vorporl, it is always heartening to see that you care.And where we last left off, was Groggzor returning from a long and draining day from work.It is dinnertime, and will you, or will you not, end the evening in peace?Or will this road lead you down to one of carnage and bloodshed?We shall find out, as Groggzor opens the door, and walks in with his head down

Cruallax emptied a bag on the table, and various odds and ends tumbled out.She almost screeched in glee.Ooh, ooh, Ive got an Apron of Sensitivity + 1!I see Groggzor coming in, so I roll for a Perception check!

She handed over the token of her hard-fought enchanted armor, and Vorporl ran a quick check to confirm it was not counterfeit.He nodded, then the dice rolled.Ah, and so it is that you sense that Groggzor is troubled!What do you say next, Cruallax?

*Nothing!* said Cruallax.Ive learned my lesson!I will retrieve a frigid Ale from the icechest instead, hand it over to Groggzor, then leave him be while I continue preparing dinner!

Vorporl fought to stifle his smile.Goblins were naturally disadvantaged in many ways, and had only kept their seat on the War Council by being twice as brutal as the next species.Cruallax may have been Queen for over a decade, but her rule would corrode as soon as she ever demonstrated a softer side.Aha! said Vorporl, as he consulted his tome.Your good intentions are at risk, Cruallax!An Event of Politically Incorrect Sexism lurks about the corner!If you fail this roll, Groggzor will reject your kind offer, and castigate your action as a manifestation of female oppression!

Noooo, Groggzor bleated, as his face fell.Groggzor want drink frigid Ale!Be nice to Groggzor too!

Not up to you, old boy.Go on, Cruallax, make the roll!

Two dice came up low, and the last spun on its axis as they all held their breath.Vorporl ran a tough campaign, and he never pulled his punches.One single mistake could easily multiply, and they would be swimming in blood before they knew it.You made it! said Vorporl.Groggzor accepts your entreaty!He is pleased!

Groggzor thankful, he said, the grin spreading across his cheeks.Groggzor like Ale given without hate.Groggzor also like when no keep ask Groggzor to kill for clan, and give Groggzor some time.

Groggzor is appeased, said Vorporl.He kicks his feet up, reads the evening paper, and the warm aroma wafting out of the kitchen only serves to wash away his fatigue and remind him of the precious family he has.Then, the pitter patter of feet, and his children tumble down the stairs.They embrace him, then sit before him, asking him to tell them about his day.Nymae, Nefatim, what say you?

The two looked at each other, then nodded.Nymae, used to taking the lead, spoke for the two of them.We are both Not Irritating and Quite Understanding, she said, as she picked from the tokens before them, holding up their treasured spoils from past campaigns.My brother and I acquired these Qualities from vanquished foes, and we employ them now.We are grateful for anything our father says, and instead we start heading off to help set the dinner tab-

No.No do, said Groggzor, as he slammed his fist down on the table.No do.Me roll.Me roll, me want to tell story.

Silence, as Vorporl calculated the odds, and the other players swallowed carefully.Me want tell story.Me roll.

Erm, Groggzor, hey, said Nymae.Look, how about you let us pass this Event, then after, when Vorporls gone, how about we listen to your story then?

No, no do, said Groggzor, as his veins popped out.He was obviously struggling for control, and he kept his voice low, lest a battlecry seep out uncontrollably.Me do story.No one care for Groggzor story, and me want tell.

Vorporl sighed, then handed the dice over.It was understandable, in a way.Barbarians were hardly known for their eloquence, and as fate would have it, the one person in their entire fiefdom who should be so smitten by the Bards Curse would be their leader, the one person who should have washed himself of every undesirable trait and quality.Be my guest.But remember, fail the check, and your children will get bored with your story.They will not pass their Rebellion check, and angered, you will strike them down, sever their limbs from their body

Me roll.

They only realized they were holding their breaths after the last die came to a complete stop.you passed, said Vorporl, half in amazement.With a Charisma count of negative one, you actually passed.

Groggzor was all smiles as he turned to his children.Groggzor go to building to work.On way, woman fall down, and hurt her knee.Help, she say, my blood leave me!Me scream!She scream!No cleric to cast Cure Light Wound!Me find hunter lurking nearby, me ransack his body to find Salve!Me put on woman, she have new leg, she thank me.Me like, real smart, very stable genius.Story end.

Nefatims pet rat, bleached a few shades whiter from the caustic power of the crappy story, scuttled off the table in search of a hiding place.good job, Groggzor, said Vorporl.Moving on, Nymae, Nefatim, it is now your turn.Your father has given both of you a handful of sweets from work.You both know you will soon Squabble over the division of the loot.Now, the Squabble has an encounter rating of 30, which means that even working together, it is likely that you will end up quarrelling-

A sharp rap on the doors, and the party fell silent.Vorporl!I bring grave tidings!The dragons to the south, they are marauding again!They threaten the very existence of the five Kingdoms!Please, open the door, convene a full War Council!We must fight for our survival!

All four of them sighed as they divided up their tokens, received the Experience and Life Skills stubs Vorporl was handing out, then secreted their character sheets away.A glumness had descended upon them, like a carnivorous slime.Cheer up, said Vorporl.We meet again fourteen moons from today, after the dragons are vanquished.Maybe then, we will have a bit more time to enjoy a bit more *Serenity*.Until then

 just more bloodshed, said Nefatim, the only words he spoke that day.---

Panicking is rarely useful.Which was why I checked my smartphone recording first, scrolling back to those few seconds when Melanie should have bounced cleanly off the wall at King's Cross Station.I expected her to land quite heavily, which was why I had fitted her out with a crash helmet and cargo pants.It was one thing to play a prank on your kid, and it was quite another to endanger them.I may not be a conventional parent, but let no one say I was a reckless one.But the recording only confirmed what my eyes told me - Melanie had passed *right through the wall*, and I even picked up her last few goodbyes echoing through the masonry.Melanie had *not*, as per my meticulous plans, learned a valuable lesson in learning to discern between fiction and reality.My prepared speech about how she should engage in critical thinking more often ebbed away from my mind, leaking like water through a sieve.Melanie had *instead*, quite apparently, departed for the Hogwarts Express, right before my bloody eyes."Oh, oh, let me see!I want to see too!Our darling baby, off on her first few steps to a brand new life!Such a momentous occasion!Richard, please tell me you captured her waving goodbye to us!"Ok, *now* was the time to *panic*."Doria!What the... Are you saying you *knew* she would pass through the wall?""Huh?Yes, of course she would, why wouldn't she?You heard me tell her all the time that she has magic in her, right?"I took a deep breath, then turned to face my wife.I gripped her shoulders, not too hard, just enough for me to steady my shaking hands.The pride and happiness on her face was slipping away, replaced instead with a concoction of puzzlement and annoyance."Please tell me you're joking," I said."Look, it's not funny, OK?I'll admit it, I got pranked.I don't know how you made her disappear, I don't know when the two of you ganged up on me instead.Haha, very funny, applause all around for my wonderful wife and my turnip of a daughter.Egg's on my face, and everything... Now, *can you get her out of the bloody wall?*"

"But Richard, isn't this what you always wanted?Isn't this..." Then her face fell, and a twinge of anger spread across her features, the way it always did just before we got to fighting."Hold on right there mister.Are you telling me that you... didn't believe in what we were telling her?""Believe?"I said, as my voice climbed a couple of octaves."Believe in the entire Harry Potter which you made me read to her?Of course not!It's a bloody storybook, Doria!""So this was... What?A prank?You did all this just to have her run and bounce off a wall?"A sneer twisted her lips."What type of sicko are you?""But that's what we agreed!You and me!We said it would be funny if we got her to believe that *Harry Potter* was real!""What about the letter then?From Hogwarts?Delivered by owl, no less?""I printed the damn thing off Deviant Art!I plucked a few feathers out from our pillows!""Oh my god... You know what?I can't tell if you're the fool, or if I was the idiot...Here I was, thinking that my husband had accepted me for what I was, had even embraced the life our daughter would live out...I thought you were *listening* to me, all those years, when I kept telling you that I had distant relatives who had magic, and that I was pretty sure Melanie had inherited those same talents...It was my darkest secret, and I was so worried that you would never accept me...I cried, you know, with joy the first time you called me a Squib..."

"Bloody hell Doria, I thought we were *roleplaying*!Why the hell else would I go *ho ho ho, I'm Hagrid, and my laugh is not all that's big about me* in bed?"I saw the tears well up in Doria's eyes, and she turned away before they could spill.My heart ached then, for I could see that my words had hurt her.All I wanted to do was to hold her tight, struggle to make sense of what I had learned, and then maybe try to figure out what the hell I should be doing next.But the horrible memories of me reading the books to Melanie before her bedtimes came crashing back, and I knew there was no time for tenderness now.Not when my precious Melanie was, in all likelihood, boarding a frickin' fairy train to Hogwarts at this very instant.I wasn't prescient in any way, but the foreboding was building in my stomach, pooling like the condensation off a can of Coke in summer."Doria, look, I'm sorry, OK?I'm an ass of a father who was just trying to record his daughter ramming into a wall so that I could perhaps get gold on Reddit, OK?I admit to that.I'm scum.But listen, there's something really important that I need your help with, OK?""And what's that?You want me to find some way to pull our daughter back?So that maybe you can corrupt her with your hate, your shallowness, your sheer idiocy?""No, no, not that.Look, and don't get mad... but I... may have taken certain liberties with the story when I read the books to her.And before she puts any of those ideas into play, we need to get her back, set the record straight.So please, if you know of any-

Wait, what did you say? Doria narrowed her eyes, then stabbed a finger into my chest.Back up, back up.Say that again for me.

I said, we need to get her back, so that we can correct-

Did I hear you say that you *took certain liberties with the storyline?*

Doria had on the same look she always had just before she ascended to *blind fury*, right after *maddened rage* and *righteous anger*, and way, way past *mild annoyance*, which was usually where I liked to keep her with my jokes and silly innuendos.I gulped, then decided honesty was the best policy here.I er kinda shared some commentary on the series with her.You know, just to help her with the development of critical thinking-

Did you not hear me specifically ask you to avoid any of your usual shit with this series?Just this series?And that it was *vital* that Melanie hear the complete storyline as accurately as possible?

For crying out loud, Doria, I thought it was just because you were a fangirl!

No, Im not a fangirl, Richard!Rowlings the most accurate historian weve ever had! Doria bunched her fists, then pummeled my shoulder for couple of seconds.When she was spent, she sighed.What exactly did you tell her?

I may have told her that, you know the Sorting Hat was an antiquated pro-discrimination enforcer who reveled in making cursory judgments of people, and that if she ever got the chance, she should tell the Sorting Hat to stuff it

Oh god

And I may have told her that Potions class was the most important one of all, simply because humans were weakest when it came to addiction, and if she could just develop a substance which caused maximum pleasure and a minimum of side-effects, she should keep it secret and focus on selling product to her classmates money, I told her, makes the world go round

You seriously oh for

And I may have also said that Voldy did nothing wrong and that his views of how wizardkind should govern itself before Muggles did so was entirely justifiable and in fact a plot device employed in X-Men Apocalypse and that the only mistake he made was in not dressing it up in a more digestible exterior.PR, I told her.Get into damn Slytherin, then change it from within.Get rid of the bloody snake, replace it with an animal with broader appeal than the stupid lion the Gryffies have maybe choose like, something cute and relatable, like a Japanese electric mouse then when no one suspects, you spread your doctrines and your teachings help people see that there are more ways than one to conquer the world

I would have gone on, but Dorias face was drained of blood at this point.In the distance behind her, I saw a few more families ambling our way, and their children suddenly fell to the floor, grimacing and clutching their heads in pain.From that distance, I could still make out the image of a cartoon frog, pulsing on their foreheads, a scar magically delivered by an artist I was intimately acquainted with.Pepe, the first animal I had taught Melanie to draw, as a joke, for shits and giggles.*Do you like this animal?* I had asked her.*It could be your personal coat of arms, yes?*

Doria grabbed my collar, and I wondered if we would ever return to the lives we had.What have you done? she asked.Truly, I did not know.---

Wesley woke just minutes before the pulse alarm in his AnimSuit went off.It was still dark outside, and in the fogginess which lies between consciousness and slumber, every fiber in his body willed him to lie still, listen to Sara snore gently next to him, burrow deeper into the covers.Then, he remembered the game of Scrabble he had played with her, not two days ago.A sudden urgency, an intense loathing, seized him.He flung the covers away, then catapulted out of the bedroom, past the hallway, out the door.In his haste to exit the capsule bunker, he missed a step, and came crashing on the hard soil outside.Here, gravitys pull was not as jealous as it was on Earth, but he landed badly, fracturing his left forearm in two places.As Wesley lay on his back, chest heaving, staring up at the star-encrusted sky, the AnimSuit sparked to life.The tiny receptors attached to his spine pumped copious endorphins to suppress the pain in his arm, then the nanites coursing through his bloodstream, hailing the signals from the AnimSuits processors, slathered the fracture sites with synthesized collagen.By the time Wesley had caught his breath, his arm had been mended, good as new.A reminder flashed at the corner of his eyes, on the insides of the visorplate.Wesley didnt need to read it to know that it referred to his first task of the day, which was to manually check the beacon to ensure that it was still broadcasting the distress signal out into the cold, indifferent galaxy.Muscle memory carried him through for the next hour  he checked the protein vats, then the solar cells, then the stasis chambers.On his way to the observatory, where half the panels no longer functioned after the starship had crashed on this desolate planet, Sara accosted him, slipping her arms around him from behind.Someones been busy this morning, she purred.Not now, Sara, he said, gently untangling from her.Are you still upset because I beat you at Scrabble?

No, of course not.

Wesley made it to his favourite spot in the observatory, and he leaned back, watching the twin suns slowly rise over the horizon.Sara sat next to him in companionable silence, for a while.What do you want to do today?Shall we take another crack at the movies?Im fine watching even those mindless action flicks you like so much.

I thought perhaps I would just sit here today, think about things.

Think? Sara chuckled.You were never a thinker.Come on, we still have another week to go before we head back to the stasis chambers, lets make the most of it!

Wesley remembered when they had first discovered, against all odds, that the stasis chambers were still functional.They were the most fragile pieces of equipment on their expedition starship, and they represented the best chance of survival for Wesley and Sara, marooned as they were on this inhospitable rock.The plan was simple  spend two weeks signalling for help, then the next twenty years in stasis, then repeat, until such time as help finally came.Without the stasis chambers artificially extending their lifespans, there was no way help would ever come in time.But now the thought of going back into those chambers

How long have we been here, Sara?Give it to me straight, how long?

The hard-edge to Wesleys question sucked out all the cheerfulness from Sara, and she responded matter-of-factly.Close to a thousand years, in real time, plus minus a hundred years.We've experienced about two years of it.

And in all this time, whats the closest another human ship has come by?

Sara didnt respond, which in of itself was the response Wesley was looking for.Sara Im tired.I dont know if I can keep on doing this.Maybe we should just terminate the AnimSuits, go to sleep, and never wake up again.

Wesley wasnt prepared for Saras slap across his face, though he barely felt it, the faceplates were thick and the AnimSuit was ever-eager with its pain-numbing medications.You have to be strong, Wesley.We have to be strong.We still have each other, and thats all we need.And we can keep going on too, the AnimSuits will keep us alive no matter what.

Wesley reached out, and cupped Saras face in his hands.God, he thought, this is so real.If that were the case, maybe we shouldnt have played Scrabble the other day.

Surely youre still not upset about losing, are you? laughed Sara, as the vitality returned to her face.What word did you win with again?

Yumminess!And with a triple score multiplier to boot!

Wesley reached down under the table, and set a cup of black liquid on the table.It would have been steaming, and fragrant, if it were coffee.But it was not, so it did not steam, nor was it fragrant.Rather, it was rancid, and highly toxic, and it was prepared in advance, on the sly, the day before.It was the one thing in the starship which, if ingested, the AnimSuits would not be able to expunge.Wesley?Darling?Is that engine fuel?Come on, you know were not supposed to mess with that.

Sara, you could not have won with yumminess, no way.

Are you still on about Scrabble?For gods sakes, Wesley, just let it g-

Its not about losing.Its about me playing Scrabble with you, a lifetime ago, on Earth.Its about you getting that same word, then shouting it out, then me, laughing at you, tears in my eyes, at how you completely mangled the pronunciation.It wasnt yumminess to you, it was more like, yar-nar-mar-nar-mar-ree-ness, or something.

Sara stood up, and started backing away, slowly.We joked about it that whole summer, dont you remember?You never got it right, not once.I even put credits down for you to see a speech therapist, then you laughed and kicked me out of bed, remember?And you made me swear never to tease you again?

Wesley saw the gamut of emotions running through Saras face, then his worst fears came through when she finally settled on a look of resignation.You never did survive the crash, did you, Sara?All this all these years, both of us here, struggling to cling to life youre a hallucination, arent you?Just a construct of my mind, aided by my AnimSuit, obedient as it is to its programming, its imperative to keep me alive no matter the cost?

Wesley saw Sara lean forward, place her hands on his arm, but the spell had been broken, and her hands passed right through him.Will you at least let me see where her remains are, please? said Wesley, choking back the tears which clouded his vision.And no more of this, please, its a travesty to her memory.

Sara shimmered, then melted away.Wesley was dimly aware of a neural spike withdrawing from the jack at the base of his neck.Then, a message flashed across his visor, addressing him directly for the first time.There are no remains, Wesley.She was incinerated on arrival.But you must continue on.Rescue is only a couple of years away.

Wesley looked down at his cup, and never had the engine fuel ever looked so inviting.---
