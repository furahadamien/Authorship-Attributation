im_not_all_sparkles
I always knew i was not normal.I have the power to conjure anything.My grandmother had ut too, so she works at a food kitchen.Unfortunatly that means that she had to teach me food first, before she could gelp me with stuff she wasint good at.She had a magic cookbook, and so i always studied with it.I was trying to make chicken soup for dinner for my brother, who was sick.I cast the spell and no soup in the bowl.I heard a low growling from the other side of the room.I sgrugged it out, thinking it was pookie, my dog, fighting with unicorn, my cat.I kept flipping through the cookbook until i heard a low, rough voice say, "How...HOW DID YOU SUMMON ME!?"I looked up finnaly and screamed."W-W-W-WHAT ARE YOU???!????!??!?!?!??"The demonic-like creature started to advance twords me.I franticly fipped through the cookbook, needing help.Gramma went back home, my little brother is sick, and my mom is on a date.Gramma never told me how to desummon things.Not knowing what to do, i panic.Everything around me swirls like a void.I fall to the ground.The world goes dark.-----------------------------------------------------------
