My room smells of weed, old pizza, and a general body odor that could be my own.The bed I sit on is half covered in books, half covered in blankets.The ground space is limited to pathways.I have never met my roommate.I always wait till he goes to bed before I come out of my room at night, and in the morning he leaves for work before I get up.John Rollingstonstein.That's what he said his name was.He had... brown hair.I think he works for the government, in that brick building by the old state hospital.Sometimes I park my car at the park nearby, watching the entryways.I don't know why.Maybe I want to see him in his more natural environment before I see him at home.He leaves his rent in an envelope.Sets it on the kitchen counter, next to the bananas.He never leaves a check, always cash.Overall, he's been a good roommate.But I can't remember what he looks like.Well, not exactly, it's more like he looks slightly different everytime I remember him.His hair shifts from brown to blonde.His height varies by several inches as if he chooses to slouch in my memory.I just can't pin him down.When did I see him last?I hear him close the apartment door.Off to work.I get out of bed, still naked, and smoke a bowl.I slip on my grimy sweatpants and the same hoodie as yesterday, and slowly open the door of my bedroom.Quiet.I walk through the door and directly into the bathroom to take a nice shit.With me, is Slow Boat by Hideo Furukawa.I sit on the toilet and read.Taking in the Japanese dropouts girlfriend troubles, and his inability to escape the sprawling confines of Tokyo, as I feel last nights McDonalds flushing out of me.The book is propulsive so far, and with a length of only 120 pages or so, it will be finished when I am standing up next.For food today I think ill have nothing.I can't think of anything to eat besides fast food, and fast food always gives me diarrhea.I'll just drink Coca-cola, smoke weed, and read, not wasting my calories.Maybe I'll go look at Rollinstonsteins brick workplace, listen to music and get high in the world at large.Avoiding the eyes of all those people.But... maybe I should just stay home today.There's no real need to leave the house.My sanity can wait another day.I wait in my room.In the dark, reading by the bleak light of the overcast winter sky.With me, on the bed, is a history book about Northern Michigan native Americans.Detailing the shift in perspective on French colonialism, by focusing instead on the dominance of the native Americans in the Straits region.An interesting book, but filled with repetition.I skim it.It is better read that way.I hear the door close.He never makes any other sound until he turns on the TV.He watches Law and Order, Big Brother, Survivor, the Office.He laughs at the fraternity antics.He makes me sick.When I hear his voice I want to clog up his throat with detritus.With all the trash that's been piling up in my room.His voice fills me with rage.But he pays the rent.And he believes that the rent is twice what it really is.
