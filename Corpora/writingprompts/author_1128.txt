UnluckyLucas
I thumbed through the pages to see no penned illustrations.I flipped back to the first page of the book to see who authored this piece, expecting to see my own name."Greasy Greg" is certainly not my name nor a handle I've ever used.I flipped to the back to read the ending of whatever route was on the last page.It said, "but damned if you do, damned if you don't, and now Croatia is underwater.""Ugh, creative non-fiction isn't really my thing," I said as I passed back the book.
