haha, "Carl when did you develop a sense of humor?"I said."Carl"?I turned to look over my right shoulder expecting to see my normally morose and impersonal driver only to see one of *them*."Oh fuck me" I stammered looking into the beady eyes of what has been the sum of all fears since childhood."You are a King not a Queen sire, and I would not be worthy to pollinate you even so" the little death dealer said.Stung already, auditory hallucinations I have to get help "Carl!"I shouted trying to see through the tree line back towards the car near the ferry where Carl must be.Stumbling into a lurching run  ignoring my still open fly. "Running will increase blood flow spreading the toxin further, stop.Think, call him you idiot!""My lord please do not distress, we live to serve."The same follow the yellow brick road voice said."We are going to be dead in minutes whoever the fuck we is" I replied pulling out my phone."I know it's in here why is it not under C, i should have.." 

"We are the elite guard pledged to you sire" Munchkin voices from all sides said at once, causing me to jolt and drop my phone.Lifting my eyes I saw them, dozens no A HUNDRED bees floating in 3 tight lines mere feet in front of me.Death for sure, i'm sorry mom I shouldn't have yelled and insisted learning to fish.A bee landed on my glasses and I froze staring at it with a kind of resigned horror."Great one, remain calm we do not have long to speak.I can tell by your reaction that we are the first unit to make contact with you".Seventeen years, constant vigilance and fear anytime out doors even when on a screened in porch, mother quitting her job to make sure she would be there if I actually got stung.Hiring a ex-military medic to drive me around after they won the local lottery, losing friends because I couldn't be allowed to play outdoors after spring.Wait, ex-medic ...the epi pen!Staring the hallucination in my eye Ii reached to my backpack and pulled out the pen popping the security tab and lifting it to strike my leg it...resisted 

"No my liege you must not!"the bee said , now sitting on the tip of my nose.That's when I saw them crawling all over my hand tiny wings buzzing.Instinctively I yelped then dropped the pen, watching in amazement as they returned to their formation."Wh-why " was all i could get out."Sir it is likely they put one of their chemicals in there, not something to help you but something to knock you out and cause memory loss" the small death dealer said."They?!you mean my fucking doctor?", "I'm talking to a bee now, I wonder if i'm even really still standing.Maybe i'm sprawled out on the ground with foam coming from my mouth as my body rages it's last defiant battle."He would not be your doctor, but theirs, Please majesty you must focus, we have little time the bear is likely already incapacitated or dead by now"

"Bear?please tell me Baloo is just around the corner ready to save me" I said."You know him?I did not know his name sir or that you were aquatined.I hope you and he will accept our apology for all the stings, we merely needed to incite him to violence to distract the human named Carl."That's when I noticed I was sitting down and it struck home.Carl was *never* out of eyesight or atleast shouting distance.He's paid more than he would make at any ambulance service just to stay by my side in case.He should be here no matter what but...a bear?"I'm not hallucinating?"i said."No my lord, I understand this is a shock but I have been trying to tell you that we are here to rescue you, quickly you must come with us" the tiny voice said, sounding more confident and resolute

Dropping the Epi pen I asked "So you didn't sting me?"The little bee's wings buzzed quickly and almost fell off my nose."Sire it would be more than my wings are worth, my whole colony would kill itself if I dared harm you."Drugs, somebody slipped me something or maybe that stuff that grows on grain and makes you trip balls.Urgot?i think that is what it was called, the cause of the salem witch trials.Well part of the cause ,religious fools that they were."Quickly sire, follow us!Alpha team you're on point, charlie team fall back to the parking lot and observe the human to see if he gives chase, DO NOT BE SEEN."The three lines of bees flew off in different directions, one toward the parking lot another in thhe opposite direction and the rest formed a halo around my head forming a crown of bees.Thinking that this was kind of cool for a nightmarish hallucination I sprang into action following alpha team."Where are we going...wait what is your name?"I asked."It is not likely you could say it in your language sire, but you may call me Carl if that seems right."the bee said whilst clinging to my glasses against the wind."Oh no, you're way more interesting than a Carl.I will call you Artemis, does that sound ok?"I said."Named by the prophesied one himself, my lord you humble me to tears" he replied.Smiling i found myself thinking this small creature which i hhad come too fear and loathe was actually kind of cute."Where are we going Artemis?""We're going to your Mother sir, she has much to discuss with you."he replied

"Oh Art, i'm sorry but I'm pretty sure my mother would coat me in a fog of raid if she saw you with me" I chuckled while running along side the river.Strange my asthma isn't bothering me."Not the human you call mother majesty.She was merely assigned to you after your kidnapping.We're going to your REAL mother, our mother, earth's mother Gaia."He replied in all seriousness."Alpha team this is it, Baker team signal evac team that we are ready to depart."He said in that oddly commanding tone for a voice sounding like it was coated in helium.Another bee flew close to my glasses and said " Wings are arleady here sir, 15 seconds"."Set ten of your weakest to wait for charlie team's return after we leave.The human will come this way looking for the king, if you think he suspects what has happened...Kill him."Art said.

"By my Antennae and Sting, life to serve commander.We will fight to the last bee."the little one said.What did he mean wings here in 15 seconds Art?"I asked just before two sets of eagle talons clenched my shoulders and carried me into the sky.
