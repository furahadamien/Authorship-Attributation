I looked around at all of my loved ones at my literal deathbed.I could see their love, their pain, and their held back tears as i breathed my last few breaths.My little granddaughter could hold it in any longer and threw herself on me, sobbing uncontrollably.I smiled weakly and stroked her hair."Hush now, my little bobcat."I lifted her chin gently, her puffy red eyes meeting mine."Will I ever see you again?"She asked between sniffles, her brown hair long and matted from the countless days she sat at my bedside.I weakly reached out and touched her chest."I will be right there.I will always be with you."This brought on a fresh bout of tears.She was now truly sobbing uncontrollably, her face buried in my chest.I went back to stroking her hair."I know.I know."I said gently.Eventually, she got a hold of herself, the tears held back by an iron will.For a six year old, Marcy was pretty strong.I chuckled to myself.She was just like her mother.I felt my life slipping away, and I looked in my granddaughters big eyes one last time."Just remember, sweetie..." I struggled for another breath, but i had to give her closure.If she didn't have it, it would destroy her."That I will always love you."With that I closed my eyes, and faintly heard her starting to cry again.I wanted more than anything to hold her, to tell her everything was going to be alright.But i couldn't.It was my time to go.I felt my body relax, and everything sank into blissful oblivion.___________________________________________________________________________________________
Troivan?Trovian!TROVIAN!I groaned and attempted to sit up.I surrounded by strange beings.They all had spikes instead of hair, and dots on their faces, and pale skin.One of them caught me and eased me back onto the mat I had been lying on."Not so fast there, my man.You took a pretty big hit of those wastions.Give it a few, alright?"I nodded weakly and laid still, trying to ignore the throbbing in my head.My vision was hazy, but I could sort of make out where I was.I was in some sort of cavern.The mat I was lying on felt like a sleeping bag.I was dimly aware of a warmth coming from my right side.Was I... camping?My eyes started to clear, and my hearing was coming back."...be alright.He took *waaay* more than he should have for his first time, but he took it like a champ."That voice.I know that voice.Who was it.I racked my foggy mind, trying to remember who that was."You sure?He looks... well... like he got hit by a Trynagog."I knew that voice too.It was decidedly different, but full of motherly concern.It sounded female.Was she my girlfriend?Friend?Fuck.I can't remember."Hey..." I said in a hoarse whisper.There was immediate movement, and the second voice floated into my head."Yes?What is it?"She asked.He face swam above my head.She was decidedly pretty.She had amber eyes, extremely pale skin, and the dots on them made a lovely pattern.Her thin mouth and brow were textbook expressions of concern."My...my..." My voice failed me, so i gestured weakly to about where my throat would be.Her eyebrows shot up."Oh!I am so sorry honey.Rythor, do have that energy drink?""Shit, I forgot about that.Hold on."I heard a dragging sound, and some stuff being pushed around, and then the clinking of a canteen.""Here.Drink up, my man."The female... it was coming back... Prilana.That was her name.Prilana.She held the canteen to my lips and i drank deeply.I felt a tingle go through my body, and my head started to clear.With a groan, I pulled myself up, gently pulling the canteen from my girlfriends hands and draining the lot of it.I blinked a couple times and took in my surroundings more clearly.We were indeed in a cave, or cavern of some sort.It I was indeed on a green sleeping bag, and a fire flickered warmly in the center of the place.Immediately in front of me was Prilana, her eyes still full of concern.A little behind her to my left sat Rythor, watching me intently with sharp green eyes.On the far side of the fire sat his girlfriend, Dyenta.He sat there passed out on a mat like I was."Well?Do you know who we are?"asked my girlfriend.I nodded slowly, and relief filled her face."Oh good.That's very good."Rythor spoke up in a cautionary tone."He might not remember everything yet.We need to keep an eye on him.He should be good in about an hour."I was suddenly aware that I was holding something in my other hand.I turned to look at it.It was a green glass bong, filled with a rocky substance and a glowing liquid.I looked at Rythor and he grinned."Yeah man.You were on a *biiig* trip.You took a double hit of wastion and started twitching out, babbling incoherently.Then you passed out for like, 3 hours."He hooked a thumb behind him at is girlfriend."She also took a double hit about an hour ago.She didn't want to be outdone.You know how she is."I dimly remember her being extremely competitive.I looked at the bong again."So... what does this stuff do again?"I eyed Rythor, and a fake, dreamy sage-like expression came over his face."It frees your soul from the constraints of space and time, and allows it to fly unbound on the wings of eternity."He snorted and dropped the expression."At least that's what my dealer told me.So... How was it?"A sudden surge of emotions roared through me.Pain, love, happiness, anger... but above all was a sense of bitter emptiness, and an indescribable feeling of loss.For some reason, I pushed all of that down and grinned at him."Its indescribable man.You gotta take a double hit."He raised his eyebrows at me."You're on, dude."I passed him the bong, and he took the double hit.Almost immediately he started twitching, and, after a bit, he laid down with a sigh.He passed out cold.I turned to my girlfriend, and held out my arms.She came and snuggled into them.I her for awhile, and then suddenly realized I was shaking uncontrollably.She turned her face to mine."Hey... are you ok?"And I just broke right there.I stared sobbing, great waves of grief and confusion tearing through my body.It all felt so *real*.The love.My family.My childhood.So I sat there, under alien sky, weeping for the life I never lead.For the granddaughter I never had.Or... had it been real?The sobs slowly started to ease, and I blinked the tears out of my face.I held my girlfriend tighter, and made a decision.It was real to me, and that was all that mattered.__________________________________________________________________________________________
