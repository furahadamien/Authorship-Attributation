"I was the first human to die".Even I thought that for a short time.It was however, not the case.There were many before me.The reason I do what I do is not because I was the first to die, but that I was the first to travel through death to safety.The plane of death is not so different from the plane of the living really, there are many unknown dangers to be had.In the living plane those dangers can lead to injury or death which brings you here to me.In this realm though, you can be killed again.This time, to the best of my knowledge, is a true death.You can take that for what it is worth though considering that whilst alive you did not know of death, who is to say there isn't another plane after this one.I digress.I learned how to make it through and I did not want to leave others behind.I have been doing it for so long I cant remember my own life from before.I just remember the desire to help others make It through.I was never a judge to any of them.I would always lead them if they were good, or evil, a man, woman or child.I did however always have a soft spot for those who were "good".I found the longer I reside in this plane the more power and knowledge I obtain.I hear from my passengers that it is the same collectively for the living.You are always growing.The millenia of work has been a great one, but it can be lonely at times not completing the path I guide so many through.You are probably wondering why I am going on so much about this to you.I promise this isn't something I do every time.I guess I just wanted you to know as the last human I will guide.You see, something amazing has happened over the last 100 years or so.It seems that humans in general has started to bypass that Primal greed that has plagued us for all of time.There has never been a soul that has offered to stay and help me in my quest.That is until recently, there have been several that have seen my mission and it wanted to help.I guess the living knowledge has gotten to a point where there is little that they fear from simple nature.From my understanding humans are the top of the food chain, the apex predators, so much so that more and more of you has started trying to change how ravenous you are.To change that inherent Greed for self-fulfillment Above All Else.Utilizing some of the same knowledge and Technology the few of you that have decided do you stand by my side in this new plane have started to conquer it in the same manner that you did the plane of the living.Instead of learning to avoid the horrors that live and hunt the souls on their way to the afterlife they have helped build walls and machines and maps that basically automate the process and ensure the safety of each Soul without my guidance.I was skeptical at first but have found the need for my guidance to be less and less.Finally after all this time, literally the span of human history, I will be able to join all those that I had guided before with the Peace of Mind that those to follow after have nothing to fear.
