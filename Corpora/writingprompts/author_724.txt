Voidageddon
Last world where they gave me the dagger, I stabbed all my friends and most of my family and quite a few acquaintances.And my cat.Things went well for a number of weeks.But then, of course, the unraveling began.I could tell that our new Earth had some of its own issues to play out, some of them perhaps worse than on our original home.So I tried again.And then again, with the same results.Now even the cat looked at me with disdain.I looked down at the dagger in my hand while the cat growled and decided I might as well.And then I stabbed myself to see what would happen next.
