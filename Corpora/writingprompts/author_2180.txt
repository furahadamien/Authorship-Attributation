"...and within this safe--which Karok just wonderfully hacked--you find a money-clip, two magazines--adult--and a smartphone.""MINE!"Deidre cried."I call the smartphone!Is it enchanted??"The others around the table groaned, sneered, or sighed.Deidre had this tick, it seemed, where she always called a found item for her own.Seeing as the elven woman was as fair and (sometimes) foul as one could be, her companions often let her selfishness slide.After all, she was married to the necromancer."Benji," she said to her husband, "Even though I'm not in that room right now, could you be a doll and pick up my new smartphone?""I suppose so, Babe, but you're not even in this house yet!You decided to stay behind at the Trader Joe's so you could count our Bitcoins!Don't you remember?It's just the three of us here now."Deidre turned her frustrated gaze to her husband, her lover."Then... You get *nothing* tonight."Only one corner of Deidre's silken lips curled into a knowing smirk.As easily as that, she won.Benji, playing as a jock--a defensive lineman with a really severe case of berserker's rage--sighed and said: "I approach the safe and snatch the gotdamn phone, okay?""Okay," their other companions muttered.These two, both staring somberly at their character sheets, counted their own equipment or loots from various sessions.Somehow, even now, Deidre got more than everyone else--and her character wasn't even in the room!But there she was, like every Sunday night, grabbing all the goods: the dope, the guns and knives, the electronics (she had nine different iPads by now).Deidre had even gained the group's first follower: a side-eyed pimp named 'Ramone'.And there she sat, chuckling still."Oops," Deidre said between chuckles, "I need to pee.BRB, boys."Deidre got up and walked out of the game room, soon disappearing into the darkness of the hallway.When she was out of sight, the others exchanged glances...

Benji started a quick conversation with their DM, asking about his theories on the 'flat-earth' movement.Old, wise Gandolf began to recite the importance of systematic socialization and exchange of knowledge, ideas...While the weathered DM continued to ramble on, the barbarian and the goblin king took turns looking over Deidre's character sheet.Only a minute later, Deidre returned and reclaimed her seat."Wait," she said immediately, noticing fresh eraser marks on her sheet."I'm missing something...I'm missing some *things*..."

Karok and Thung both did their bests to play it cool; the goblin had a noticeably harder time hiding his guilt than the hefty barbarian.Gandolf, almost always all-knowing, had been enraptured by his soapbox speech; Benji had stopped listening almost instantly.The ruse had seemed to work--until now.It would not last for long."Someone took my QP of Granddaddy Purp.And I'm also missing my Apple watch.Now, we all know it took three weeks for me to get that stupid watch!+3 my ass.Who took it?!Fess up right now!"No one spoke.Deidre snapped her angry glare on her husband."Well?""Uh," the necromancer mumbled, "I need to pee, too."Benji quickly rose from his chair and exited the room."I see," Deidre whispered vindictively.She ripped a page from her notebook, swiftly scrawled a message, then passed the note to Gandolf.The mage's bushy eyebrows seemed to rise three full inches up on his forehead."Really?...Are you sure?"he asked, almost silently.Deidre simply nodded, her lips drawn into a tight, thin line."Alright then," Gandolf began, sounding both sad and resigned, "as the jock exits the room where you found the safe, a cold, dark mist begins to rise around Karok and Thung's feet...

"Make a saving throw."The barbarian tossed his green-orange 20-sided into the dice tray; the goblin snickered as he did the same with his puke-yellow die."Rook resists the chilling effects--with a 14.Unfortunately," Gandolf turned his eyes on Thung's, "D-Baby is paralyzed--with a 3."Karok smashed a hammered fist against the tabletop, in glee.Thung, on the other hand, groaned.He knew what was coming.They all did.Deidre's ghostly specter arose from the gathering mist behind her companions.The witchy spell-thief did exactly as her note had entailed: rapidly, she struck out with her enchanted switchblade, digging its stiletto point deep into Karok's shoulder.(Deidre rolled.Critical hit!)"You take nine surprise damage, Karok," Gandolf noted.Deidre's character then reached out with a blue-gray hand, shimmering in magical fire, and hit the goblin with a shock of e coli."Ooph," said Gandolf, shaking his head and frowning, "You take minus ten HP from your maximum, Thrung: D-Baby's pretty sick."Benji, meanwhile, was hiding in the hallway, hoping his wife wouldn't lash out at him too.He was a fool.Deidre's character, enraged, withdrew a +7 Republican-Biased Trump Gun.This she aimed at the wall and opened fire.(Deidre rolled once more.12.Not a critical, but definitely a solid hit.)"Oh, man," Gandolf said.A bead of sweat rolled down his long forehead to be caught in his brow."Sorry, Benji...

"The sound of Deidre's trump gun is loud and obnoxious, but devastating nonetheless!Bentarius, still in hiding outside of the safe room, is showered with plaster and takes... ah... oh... plus the bonuses... uh, Deidre?Is that a plus 6 or a plus 7 trumper?""It's a plus 7," she clarified proudly.Gandolf's face seemed to go white--whiter than normal, anyhow."Benji," the wizard said, "I do believe you're dead.""Dammit!"Benji howled as he stepped back into the game room."Not again, Dee!This is the third time this month!"Deidre offered an innocent shrug and reached for her companions' character sheets, ready to loot her friends."What would you prefer, dear?A knife in the back?Or a few less Bitcoins to revive you?""I think I'd rather play Monopoly next time."
