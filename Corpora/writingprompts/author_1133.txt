Like countless times before I pick up the book of my life, filled with all the decisions I did and could have done, it was more of an e-Book really, displayed on what looks like a Kindle, changing the contents of the page based on what I told it would be my decision.Today I tried my luck with yet another unexplored path, choosing to take the job as a programmer after my studies had concluded.And there I sat, reading for what had to be days upon days about what life would have entailed, always making the decision that seemed the most natural to me and then often going back a step and trying the other routes life could have had in store for me.When I finally finished I had a smile on my face, no matter what I had chosen, no matter what path I went, it always ended in a miserable and bitter life, just like the countless times I had done this before.I had yet another hundred paths that all support my final decision, the decision that had been bothering me for many years prior to my death and the more stories I read, the more I got to know about what my life could have been, the more it became clear, that the one correct decision I took in life, was to take it.
