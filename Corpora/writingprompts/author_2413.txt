I really feel that this WP deserves anything but a first person writeup.I can imagine the villain described as not thinking much about themselves.Or even thinking as themselves.They'd be something with an eeire lack of identity.With a basic sense of self preservation and a job to get done.Like a cross between Agent 47 from the old Hitman games and the dog from Black Mirror episode Metalhead.It might seem that they are less powerful because they don't work with their own purpose but it is that dgaf attribute that makes them so terrifying.[Sorry for putting this as a top level comment.I hadn't read the sticky yet.Stupid of me, I know.]
