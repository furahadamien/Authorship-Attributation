Marionette 

Edit- I edited the entire story and sort of the ending and plot line.I think it is better now 


She sits there with a small tea cup in hand, an array of cakes and biscuits laid In front of her.She sips from the miniature cup of tea, becoming me to come over.I glance around, the tall wooden walls of the echoing room surrounding me.The walls shine bright in sparkling rose gold.The floor creaks with every touch, unlike the glimmering walls it is dirty and covered in slabs of paint.I step towards
 the small child in curiosity and inspect the small childish seats besides the table.Who is this young little girl?As I begin to ask the question, I ponder.How did I get here?Wasnt I at home?I shrug off the thought provoking question and sit in the tiny chair, my knees hitting the tables roof.The sweet smell of strawberries fill the air.The silence is broken by her childish spatter.Have some tea! She exclaims, pouring me a cup of seemingly tea, overfilling the cup causing what happened to be  plain water to spill all over my clothes.But  amongst my dismay of the cold liquid, I realise, what am I wearing?I stand up to find myself wearing a large puffy dress, covered in hot pink frills.My hair is curled by my shoulders and i glance to see a pair of glittering ballet shoes, the sparkles  dancing on my feet.I stare at the dress in shock, but Im subsequently invited back to the tiny tea table by the little girl.I pick up the tea cup curiously, tasting the plain water.It tastes plain, distilled even.In my eagerness, I pick up one of the delectable cupcakes, its freshly baked, warm in my hands as the sweet buttercream melts off the perfectly iced top.I take a small bite to find no flavour, as if I was biting into foam.I shake my head, as if to have been tranced and take another, larger bite.Nothing, as if I expected it to be different, perhaps flavourful with a second bite filled by sweet flavours of vanilla and berries.The girl stares at me as if I hadnt moved, staring into her eyes with nothing but a cold, heartless glare.Come on!Try the biscuits! She cried excitedly, in her repetitive childish tone.In desperation, I shove one of the delicately decorated biscuits into my drooling mouth.But alas, nothing.The girl stares at me with a befuddled blank stare, only to be stopped by the sound of heavy footsteps.A woman walks into the glittery room, and scoops the little girl out of the chair.She laughs cheerfully as the tall lady carries her around the room.The girl giggles as she is swung around as if to be flying by the woman.Suddenly I feel pulled by my arm, roughly dragged out of the tea room.I cry in pain, but I hear nothing.I abruptly learn that I cant even move my mouth.Have I been at all?Have I been eating at all?Have I been moving at all?These thoughts dash through my panicked mind as I feel myself thrown onto a fluffed carpeted floor.I see a mirror thrown onto the fluffy floor, my reflection resulting in nothing but a petite wooden doll, a blonde headed marionette clothed in the frilly hot pink dress and a few fake biscuits poking out of a palm-sized handbag.I try to move and in my efforts a small styrofoam cupcake with a large cartoon bite falls out of the pretty in pink bag near my decorated ballerina feet.I Am entranced by the strings that latch from my limbs, moving my legs about as the girl yanks me by my strings.Suddenly Im hoisted up like the controlled wooden doll I appear to be, and am thrown deep into a dark, cold basket.A black hole filled with stuffed toys, broken parts and lonely dolls.The lid is slammed shut and I feel myself stuck in  a noiseless, endless oblivion, 

awaken to yet another tea party.
