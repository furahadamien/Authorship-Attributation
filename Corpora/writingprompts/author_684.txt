"The coroner's report just came in" shouted Dahiya, rushing to greet me as I stepped out of the elevator into the crowded precinct."It's...weird" he continued, as he followed me to my desk.Setting my coffee down on the table, I grabbed the report from his hands and bade him summarise it."They found trace elements of glass...and what appears to be silver residue on the wounds.The victim was killed by what looks like a shard from a mirror.That's the eleventh one that shares the MO" said Dahiya."What do you think it means?""It means we have a dozen bodies and an MO, but no suspect" I grunted."What about the victim that didn't have the silver and glass residue on them?"Dahiya heistated."They reckon it's the same killer, based on the pattern of the incision and the methods employed in the murder.Perhaps they were trying out a different weapon...getting accustomed to their pattern?"I sighed."Whatever it is, we'll find the sick mind that did this.If it's the last thing I do" I said, preparing to pore over the report before starting my day.Dahiya hesitated."I'm sorry, I know this must be hard for you.We can ask for a re-assignment if you want?"He waited patiently for a response.I grew impatient."Why?Because my wife was murdered by whoever it was?No, all the more reason why I should be on this case and help catch him as soon as we can.I won't rest till he's behind bars."It wasn't until I finished speaking that I realized the stares of the office.I hadn't noticed I was shouting."I'm sorry, I didn't mean..." Dahiya began, but I didn't let him finish."If you have time to apologise, you have time to help find the killer.Get to it."-------------

I switched the lights on as I came home, immediately hanging my coat and hat on the rack and heading to the basement.The familiar smell of damp greeted me as I turned on the flourescent lights in the basement.I made my way to the middle of the room, where the Mirror stood.The ornate carvings on the wood ran down the entire length of the oblong frame, and were in no language I had ever encountered before, yet felt strangely familiar to me.I gazed into the mirror.Instead of a reflection, I was looking at three people erecting what appeared to be a wooden frame for a house.A fourth joined them, emerging from the wooded area just behind the wooden frame, holding in her hand several berries and fruit that she must have picked while foraging.How long had it been since I'd seen her so cheerful?Certainly not since our application for a child had been rejected for the first time.Since the energy crisis, the one child policy had taken it's toll on families, and ours was no different.I remember the shock at seeing her lying there, bleeding out in front of the mirror, shard in hand.And then looking into the mirror to find her there, as confused as I was.There was no time to lose, I had to work quickly.I thought about providence as I set about carefully grinding a shard of the mirror into a fine powder.Working at the police department had it's privileges.Firstly, I was able to throw them off the scent by conducting my experiments disguised as a serial killer.I could avoid suspicion for now; no one would suspect the victim to be the killer, least of all a cop.It's why I chose this MO, after all.Secondly, I had access to the coroner's reports for each kill, which provided me with invaluable information.I knew that you needed to have traces of the Mirror present in your body at the moment of your death in order to cross over.The sacrifice I had made, although not my own, was crucial to figuring this out.I looked over at the map on the wall in front of me.The river, the city's source of water.I needed a way of getting the powder into the dam.I looked at the bags of home-made poison under the counter, checking to see that they were intact, hoping they would be enough.Soon, I too would join them in the other world.But not just yet.There was something I had to do first...
