There it is!After 5 long years, at last we are about to arrive to investigate the mystery.Soon, humanity will know.It all started that fateful day, 5 years ago, when the Mars Water Radar continually was receiving strange results over a particular area on Mars.Eventually, a radio transmitter was found.No lander was known to have attempted to land there, however.Photographs were soon taken, and a large structure was observed, clearly steeper than any natural object is on Mars.The object was about 10 meters across, and from the shadows, about 30 meters tall.No one could offer an explanation for that object.Eventually, it was decided that humanity must visit it, in person.It grows larger, as you decent.All you can tell is that it is as tall as was expected, but dust covers it up, hiding it from view.You continue on your rover trip to visit the mysterious object, having confirmed that it is still emitting radio waves.Wait, you see something odd, it looks like a solar panel, near the top, is slightly uncovered.That might be the power source for the radio waves!But strange, it looks, well human.The object, with no explanation, was thought to be of alien origins.The people of Earth demanded answers The Mars Intrepid rover was sent, but it wasn't able to get close enough to the object to get any answers.It was decided a human mission must be sent.As you approach the object, you notice something buried in the ground nearby, flapping.You approach it, and get out of the rover.It looks almost like cloth.It is very fragile, with many holes in it, but it clearly was a rectangle, and might have been a dark red color, with another color you can't identify in the dust.It reminds you of a flag.You continue on foot the rest of the way to the artifact.It appears to be rusted, almost as if it was made of steel.Who would make a spacecraft of steel, given the power to come to this planet?You circle round the artifact.You then notice something even stranger.There is a ladder.You decide to ascent it.On your way up, you knock off some loose dust, and then you see it, a Soviet flag.Wait, a Soviet flag?This object was human, and old.Confused, you decide to enter.Entering, you see something is amiss from the beginning.A thin black film covers everything.Going further inside, you notice a burned panel, it is evident a fire burned the console.Still, you see nothing else amiss.Finally, you decide to look around a bit more.You notice a small mound a few feet away.You decide to investigate.It's a body!You quickly dust it off.In it's hand, you see a note."Landed on Mars.The spacecraft stopped working.I couldn't communicate with Earth.After running out of food, I die here, on Mars, looking up to the Sky."
