I can feel it, the change in him as the end is drawing closer.It is almost inconceivable, still doesn't feel real that such a great power and intellect such as he can be worn down by time.but after lifetimes being a kind and benevolent father, provider and protector to generations of my family, after bringing in my own children and caring for them like he did for me and my fathers before me.... Time is wearing at him.Even in his greatness i can feel its not long now.If this isn't his last morning then tomorrow surely will be.I hope i was a 'good boy'."Botty, come here boy"
I spring up, part of me forgetting his weakened state had hoped for a walk but as i focused on him i could see that wasn't even a remote possibility."sorry boy, no walk today"
i didnt bring the lead, how did he know i wanted a walk?he always new what i needed, even if i didn't know.until the last few months, before his hair had started falling out - there had appeared no limits to his ability."oh Botty, look at you... one of the most beautiful creatures on this earth, but without an ounce of vanity.Courage beyond any care for yourself, willing to throw yourself at any danger that might come to our family's home, even if it was just the mailman....again.""Loyal and infinite loving, perhaps matched only by your patience, i still remember you letting young Byron climb on you pulling your ears when you were trying to sleep, never an ounce of misdirected anger"

"I lost my patience with loved ones, numerous times.I Wasn't there when i should have been, with someone else when i should not have been and its too late now" 

"Botty, i realise now that you are who i wish i could have been if i had a fraction of your strength.You are a perfect example of every positive attribute and personality trait i wanted and tried to have.Without any of my numerous faults and weaknesses"  

As i looked up i could hear his breath slowing, his words were taking a toll on him.He's struggling to say something, i sense this is likely his last breath."i hope atleast I've been a good master"
