My senses come back slowly, sluggish and temporal.The reflection of flashing blue and red lights.A keening wail sounding distant, but insistently knocking on the edges of my awareness, like a prisoner pounding his fists on the cold empty walls of his cell.Help had arrived.A wary relief, then darkness.A sense of action and urgency, motion.Memories made from TV, ones I'd never expected to own personally.Pressure on the sides of me, a neck brace.The sound of clattering wheels, rectangles made of light moving swiftly across my personal landscape, a gurney; a hospital ceiling.I've been transported, that much I know.That's all I know until I become aware of a faint beeping.I fade out again."CLEAR!"My chest is violently wretched up."CLEAR!"My body zings with electricity, I'm strangely aware of my body hair standing at attention."CLEAR!"I feel my shoulders hit the bed and keep falling.The rest of me goes with them, falling, falling, falling.I think I can just barely hear the faint beeping noise, now just a single flat tone.I feel a draft.Simply having senses again is a shock.I think back to my last memories.Surely that last noise was my heart monitor, I must have been dead.Which means...I must have been revived.I should be ecstatic, my brain tries to fill me with gratitude, I think it's the shock.I can't even feel properly ashamed of not being thrilled.That's ok, it will come later.I open my eyes expecting to see white walls, maybe a nurse.Through my grogginess I can tell I'm being attended.Something is out of place though.What is it?Here is my nurse, she has stringy blond hair, why isn't it tied back?Her face, it doesn't have the calculated look I've come to expect from hospital workers.The room... the room is... pink?All at once it hits me, I'm being cared for by a child.Im in a 6 year olds bedroom.This isn't where I'm supposed to be, what's going on?!"Now Miss Penny your gonna need lots of rest.Drink lots of fluids and take your medicine", the girl has been chatting at me for a while now.I stare dumbfounded as she pretends to take my blood pressure."Mmmhmm, that's what I thought", she says seriously."Eleventy over ten."She nods to herself knowingly."Now Miss Penny, it's time to take your temperature, open wide and say 'ahh'"

My mouth opens.It says 'ah'.Did I do that?"Who are you?"I ask."Your nurse of course.You've been in a very bad accident.Yup.Bad a lot.You've got 100 broken bones.""No I don't" I begin to reply, no sound comes out and it doesn't matter anyway.Suddenly my whole world is on fire.I can't see through the pain, I try to scream but nothing happens.Im locked in it.I can hear her babbling but can't understand through my torment.My mouth opens and she pretends to put a spoon in my mouth.I swallow.The pain dissipates."See, all better!"She says."That's why you have to take your medicine".My limbs feel normal again.I sit up.I try to run."Now now, you can't be going out with those broken bones like that" she scolds.Instantly I'm back in bed.I can't move most of my body... she's remembered that Im supposed to be broken, so I am.It seems my experiences are dependent on her imagination.Her play.I need to think.I need to figure out how to communicate, or escape.Later.I know now that her dream is to become a doctor.Or maybe an EMT.She's smart, I know she can accomplish what she wants.She takes inspiration from TV shows.And practices on me.I'll never forget the feeling of having my eyelids being melted shut with fire.The special that week was the burn unit.The more she learns, the worse it becomes.More details equal more trauma.I can still smell my flesh decaying from leprosy, the pain of being amputated without painkillers.Im also extremely grateful to her.Or I guess, dependent.She cares for me.Gives me medicine.It wasn't her fault I was in such pain, she just forgot to administer the anesthesia.It wasn't out of malice.Although, sometimes, her imagination gets exceedingly dark.Those are troubled times for me.Today she's been telling me all about "youth in Asia" and I pray desperately that when she puts me down it'll be for good.Whatever hell or purgatory this is, I can't stand it.I pray for a final death.Everything goes black as she sticks me with the imaginary needle....Damn.Im still here.It didn't work.I groan inwardly, waiting for whatever hell is in store.Waiting to be given a direction.Waiting to comply.Nothing happens.I open my eyes cautiously."Oh, your awake!We were getting afraid that you wouldn't.It's good to see you."There is a nurse, a real nurse bustling around me, checking my pulse; my temperature.Im in a hospital, a REAL hospital."Who are you?"I ask.Uneasily recognizing those first words as the ones I did when I woke up in hell."My name is Nurse Jackie hun, your in Saint Christopher's hospital- trauma ward.You've been delt a bad blow.I'll just need to ask you some questions, standard procedure..."

She comes round the bed, I catch sight of her yellow hair, a flash of her eyes.She starts to say something comforting to me, but I can't hear her.Im screaming.Screaming for all the pain and torture I was put through.Screaming for all the unheard ones I never was allowed to utter.Her eyes widen in fright and she disappears, 
maybe to get someone.It doesn't matter, the screams tear my throat out and still they come.I don't know if they'll ever stop.
