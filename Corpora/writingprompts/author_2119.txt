"Turn around, did I find you?"I turn around.Before me, I see the most beautiful sight I've ever beheld.Long, wavy red-brown hair cascading over strong but thin shoulders.She wears a dress, simple and black.Hands raised defensively, fingers folded in thought.Full lips, trembling with emotion.Eyes shiny and green, holding back from crying.A girl.A real girl."You found me a long time ago, didn't you?"I respond.She gives me a shaky smile."Yeah, but you weren't ready to find me."A tear rolls down her face.I gasp slightly and touch my cheek.It's wet.I am crying too.I can feel my heart racing in my chest.I can hear the gentle words of encouragement my friends have spoken to me over the past months, to coax me into being confident enough to try and find this girl, to reach out to her.I don't deserve such good friends.I'm incredibly happy to have them anyway."I...I didn't think you were real," I say hesitantly."You're lying," she shakes her head, but still smiles, "lying to yourself.You did think I was real.Other people just made you believe you were deluding yourself.""Am I not deluding myself?""How do you feel right now?""I feel... free.Like a weight's been lifted.Like I can breathe, even though I have trouble breathing right now.""That's how it is for many the first time."I wipe at my eyes.My smile fades and I shake my head."I can't go back, but I have to.I can't show myself like this.""Why not?""They will think I'm a freak!They won't recognize me for who I am, they will just impose their own view of me on me, force me to be someone I am not.They won't call me by my name.They won't let me live in safety.Gods, if my family knew--"

"What if they did?"I freeze in shock.What *if* they did?I stare ahead of me, at her.What if...If they knew, would they accept me?I don't know my brothers as well as I could, and my mother has always been a nurturing and kind soul.Would this really change things?My world would be turned upside down, but with my family and my friends supporting me... maybe I could do it?"What if they did..." I mutter to myself.I feel a spark of warmth in my chest.As I think more about what could be, what I could become, about how life could be better, my confidence begins to rise."Maybe I *will* tell them..." I say."Yes.""Maybe I *will* start this process," I say."Yes.""I will make things better!I will be who I want myself to be!""Yes!"I let out an elated sigh and can smile again.I reach out with my fingertips and brush against the mirror."Thank you," I whisper to her, and see myself smiling back.
