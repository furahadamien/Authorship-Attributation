DeathandHemingway
The last thing I remember, I had been sitting in my chair.It was hard to remember a time when I was able to do anything but sit, in a half sleep, in that cursed chair, in an empty room.Yet now I feel the sun on my face.It feels like millenia have passed since I've felt such warmth.I raise my hand to shield my eyes from the glare, and fall out of the tree I'm laying in.I land on the soft earth, unharmed.Pulling myself together, I look around, but see only trees.I look up to the sun, and I remember.I remember everything.I remember the mushrooms, but I remember the life lived.The people led.The enemies defeated.The successes and the failures.The mistakes.I remember it all.I rise to my feet.I must build my empire.Chaos must be defeated.
