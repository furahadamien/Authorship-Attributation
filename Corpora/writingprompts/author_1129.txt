I died alone.Missing my children and wife after the car crash 30 years ago.I had had a few drinks that night and though technically sober, I always felt like it was my fault or wondered what I could have done better..In my grief, i left the home we built together and all friends we had made over the years would write and call occasionally, but would always want to start talking about how I had to buck up or move on.I had tried to date, even had a few great dogs to keep me company over the years but it was never the same.I decided to get over my fears by helping others.I joined AA, I helped build parks and named the playgrounds after my children.I even named a bench for my wife and ate there every Sunday for nearly 30 years.When I finally died and went to heaven, I was given a book.It was strange though.I got to read about the lives of all the decisions s that never happened because of that one day.I got to see pictures of my children going to prom.I got to see my wife get old.I couldnt believe it but I was supposed to have twins!St Peter looked at me and asked me a single question.Would you do things differently now that you know what you lost?I heard later other people waited decades before answering, but I knew my answer immediately.No.I have made mistakes, many of them in my lifetime.However, if this is heaven, my wife and kids are here and already know that I never stopped loving them and went on with my life helping others each day while thinking of them.St Peter smiled and said welcome back to your family.
