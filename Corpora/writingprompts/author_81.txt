"No!No!Don't become a pornstar!"Me from 4 lives ago began shouting at the screen."The male ones don't make any money!"said me from 1 life ahead."Who cares?He'll be living the rest of his life banging hot girls!"objected me from 10 lives ago

"But it's like your favorite food or music, when you have it too much you get bored.""Not to mention the STDs," pointed out me from 7 lives ago."We know you were a fucking doctor, shut the fuck up!"The speaker (I honestly can't keep track of the numbers) was a boxer who had anger issues."Make me bitch!"'Hold up, hold up, he's gonna decide!"said one of the younger mes.The current me started deciding between a full ride to his state college and going with his contact in the industry labeled in his phone as "Slimy Susan".Eventually, he put down his phone, and started looking up careers for an english major."NO!"shouted me from 4 lives ago."Shit, become a pornstar, become a pornstar!"A brawl broke out between the mes.I put my head in my hands.I'd really prefer hell right now.
