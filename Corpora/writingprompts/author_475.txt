You turn on the television excited, yet confused about why you need to watch another year of the Oscars.The substandard list of critically acclaimed movies nominated for best picture has you kind of annoyed but what else are you going to do on a Sunday night.You had planned on having a viewing party with friends and food, before you remembered that you had no friends and you have been on a juice cleanse for the past 12 days.In your caloric deficit zombie like state you plop yourself on to the love seat with your big gulp.You are a hoarder and there are musky odors of something that is very familiar but indiscernible to the nostrils in your apartment.While you contemplate your lifestyle, you take a hit from a bong that is worth more than your car.The TV brightens up and you hear "Welcome to the 2032 Oscars!I am your host Matt Damon!"You can't contain yourself.Matt Damon is the single greatest actor of all time.You had no idea that he was going to be the host this year.All of a sudden your apartment doesn't smell so bad.Your energy is revitalized as you unconsciously are eating a slice of pizza that was tucked in the corner of your love seat cushion with minimal hair.You now have a friend and that friend is Matt Damon.You feel alive for the first time in years if not decades.Sweat starts to drip from your forehead profusely.You wonder if the weed you have just smoked has something to do with it or if your drug dealer was selling you left over spice again instead.YOU ARE F!@#$&#37;\^ JAZZED!Your pupils dilate as Matt Damon announces *Avengers 8: Spiderman Goes To Rehab* for best picture.The minutes seem like hours as your anticipation grows exponentially.You are at one with Matt Damon.He understands you like no other TV host could.Just as Matt Damon finishes announcing that Macaulay Culkin has won best supporting actor for his role in *Batman 6: Batman's Birthday* as the Penguin you begin to well tears of joy for how beautiful a celebration this is whilst being hosted by Matt Damon.Your vision is obscured by the fluids coming out of your eyes, nose, and ears.There is a bright flash on the screen followed by blood curdling screams.You wipe your face with a loose napkin from a crumpled Burger King food bag only a few inches away to see what is going on.Thats when you realize.Matt Damon is gone.The suit that he was wearing was still suspended in air as if it was still held up by Matt's glorious bod.The microphone was making a static sound but was still hanging in the air completely still.To your horror, you see the camera panning around looking for Matt for a brief few seconds then the station cuts off air.You vigorously search the internet to see what is happening with the situation.Nothing of substance.Then you hit the goldmine.Sub r/UFOs appears to have footage of a UFO hovering over the event center from a basic bitch taking a boomerang picture of herself with the Los Angeles skyline in the background.You notice that apart from the girl shaking her butt on the loop and doing some weird pose that there was a flash of light at the same timestamp that your precious Matt disappeared.You investigate further while trying to keep yourself composed.You are utterly ripped apart on the inside, but you cannot show your emotions since you need to stay strong for your 13\-year old pug named Sexy.He takes a shit on the floor and snorts, while you eat a Fritos corn chip off of your laptop that you found.You go to your favorite website for news that is always reliable and unbiased, .They have been reporting on the magical disappearance of Matt Damon for over an hour now and keep showing the same five second clip on a loop.You report an anonymous tip about the UFO.They call it fake news.You report the same tip again, this time it is accepted and they now have a 6 second loop to show of the UFO flashing its light.Thats when you notice that a naked man can be seen in one of the frames for a split second floating in between the UFO and the event center.You can recognize that frame anywhere, that is Matt Damon.One step closer to rescuing Matt.Your heart is pounding you slip on your shoes only to find that Sexy has taken a shit in them.Theres no time to take them off, you must rescue Matt.You fly out of your apartment and race to your car.The 1994 2\-door Honda Civic you drive is basically designed for speed and will do nicely for a quick rescue if you can manage to get it started.You jump into the drivers seat, jam the key into the ignition and crank it.There is a loud gunshot like sound.Misfire.You crank it again and the car barely turns over.A smile fills your face and is soon ruined by the smell of Sexy's poop in your shoes."Im on my way, Matt!"you scream.It has now been two hours since the abduction and you turn on your radio.Now its time for a tough decision, Fleetwood Mac or news about the incident?You regrettably choose news about the incident."They have I.D.ed the vessel that has abducted precious Matt Damon" the radio exclaims."It has moved about 20 Km west over the Pacific Ocean, atop of the Catalina Islands."As you drive from the Inland Empire you notice rioters and burning buildings."A meeting of the world leaders is set via Skype tonight to address the safe return of Mr. Damon, Americas National Treasure" the radio tells you.You are livid it has been approximately 5 hours and Matt Damon is still missing, scared, alone, and helpless.You fire on the turbo, and make good time.You finally reach LA only to find it burning and looted due to the mass rioting and hysteria of a world without Matt Damon.You sneak on a military boat at the harbor headed for Catalina.Once you get closer to the island you realize the entire US Pacific fleet has congregated around the island.They fire upon the massive UFO and you scream for fear that they may injure Matt!To no avail, the rockets and missiles bounce off like rocks and explode as they hit the island below.The captain of the military vessel spots you and for some reason thinks your his first mate.He orders you to take a small 5 man crew to shore and try to reason with the UFO that is now hovering only 5 feet above the island.You go along with it.As you approach the UFO, you can hear Matt Damon laughing hysterically as if he is being tickled to death.A drip of sweat drops down your back.You fart a little, not sure if it was clean or if you sharted a little bit.You assure your crew that it was clean, because thats what leaders do.When the tough gets going, the going gets tough.You ask the guys if they want to get beers afterwords and get rejected outright.Its no secret that your crew utterly despises you.The UFO is ominous indeed.Upon closer inspection, you realize that it is not shaped like a traditional circular UFO, it is just a giant box.The UFO has touched down now and is flush with the landscape.There is no clear entry into the box.It appears to be made of organic material much like wood.Matt Damons laughs become louder and more outrageous.You and your crew scream out to let him no you are there with no response.The crew needs to be ready for anything, you tell them to keep there eyes open.They tell you to "fuck off".A bit hurt, you lean against the other side of the box trying not to cry.The rest of the crew is inspecting the box they all press there hands against it and you hear a large crunch.The door to the box has flipped open like a ramp and crushed your entire crew to death.You are indifferent.The madness of Matt Damon's laughs is deafening and you inspect the opening of the UFO.It is damp, dark, and moist inside.You creep inside slowly still weirded out by the laughs.The door snaps back up behind you and neon blue lights flicker on.Matt is sitting in a chair, straight faced.No expression at all, staring at you intently."Hi Matttt, I'm a uh big uh fan" you stutter.The room is completely empty no controls just four empty white walls.His expression changes from nothing to smiling."What are you doing in my palace?!"he shrieks.He is twitching a bit now as if he has a slight case of Turrets."Just came to uh rescue you" you state unconfidently.His facial expression has changed to anger."Does it look like I need rescuing?!"Matt screeches.He pulls out a metal stick that seems to be electrified and runs at you laughing crazily."I'm going to eat you!"he cries.At this point you realize you probably should have just stayed home.Did you really stand a chance as cashier to take on aliens that abducted Matt Damon?No, probably not.You realize what you must do.The world needs a hero.You are that hero.Your chest fills with air you perk up as you feel that you are the only man for the job.Your muscles tighten and jaw clenches.You have to sacrifice yourself for the good of Matt Damon.You sit down and let Matt Damon eat you bite by bite.Matt Damon thereafter gains all your powers and becomes overlord of the earth.He commands a human sacrifice daily to eat and inherits your pug, Sexy.Fin
