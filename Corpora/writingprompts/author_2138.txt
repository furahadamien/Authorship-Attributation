6:49 PM.That was the time that was displayed on the dash of my work van as I sat in evening rush hour.What seemed to be buckets of water instead of raindrops were falling from the sky, wind was howling through the open cracks in my piece of shit work van (I should really get a better one and write it off) and lightning was illuminating the horizon with incredible frequency.The conditions were bad, and it was taking well over 2 hours to move what has been exactly 3.4 miles out of the 30 that I need to complete.At this rate, perhaps it will take 20 hours to get home?Who knows, I didn't become a welder for no reason.Dinner is at 7:30 and I was meeting with my buddy to discuss his bachelorette party so more progress on my commute needed be made.&#x200B;

I look to my right, and the next exit reads "RAVEENA BLVD NE 65TH ST".Perfect.I could've just gone up Ravenna to East Green Lake Way, and just go up Aurora.So I get off at the exit.Big fucking mistake.&#x200B;

I get off the freeway and make my way up Ravenna.I got up to about 45 as the road opened up and there was space.Look to my phone and see a message from Jack."On my way now.Might be late, don't hear good things about traffic on the 5 according to Waze".Perfect, I had more time and can slow down a little.I lift my foot of the gas and started to type something along the lines of "No worries" before I lurch foward and I can no longer see anything.Fuck.&#x200B;

I look up and as I slam on the brakes, the man flies off of my windscreen and just falls onto the road.Before I can swerve to avoid him, I drive over what seems to be a speed bump.I can barely muster the ability to hit the brakes in a smooth, consistent fashion and pull to the side of the road.My hands shake and I feel sick.There's no way he is alive.I had just killed a man in a matter of seconds, and I didn't even need to rush.I slowly climb out of my van, eyes filling with water, not sure if it is the rain or my tears from taking someone's life.In the 500 yards it takes for me to travel to his body, thoughts of incarceration, my wife finding another man and leaving me, losing any chance of a prosperous future, upsetting my mother, father and everyone I know for deciding to speed and text in poor conditions that ended up at the expense of some random guy.I approach the body and there is so much blood.He is unrecognizable.Look at the shirt and it reads " Jack's Plumbing".&#x200B;

My god.I just killed one of Jack's employees.I start to clear out what I texted him and start to communicate to him that something has just gone very wrong.I look at my phone and stare at it.Nope.I rewrite "No worries" and send it off.As I am running my hands down this mans body and sobbing, I feel a vibration.I just killed my best friend.Before I can even think about this, the skill of plumbing immediately downloads into my brain, and I get a notification: "**WELCOME TO THE GAME, JACK.KILL OR BE KILLED, THE CHOICE IS YOURS.THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE JACK OF ALL TRADES".** He is already gone.I need to fight for myself, and my kids.I get up and run towards my vehicle, and realized i can no longer drive it.It is covered in skin fragments, blood on the windscreen and is slightly damaged.I start to walk away as if I could escape a fatal car accident during evening rush hour in Seattle.A police officer shows up to the scene of the accident, and asks me for my recollection of events.I tell him, he nods his head, identifies the body, establishes that the my buddy to be dead and asks me for my drivers licence, registration and insurance.I pull out my wallet and give him my licence.I read his badge and it read  "J. Martins".He comments "my name is also Jack" and looks at me.&#x200B;

Gotta kill this motherfucker.Life has this way of presenting opportunities in the most unconventional circumstances possible, but its time to spring into action.I had no choice.He turned around to walk to his car and told me to get my registration and insurance in my vehicle.The paramedics and firefighters are on the way, and there will soon be even more witnesses.I will have no chance to kill this guy and I will be killed.I see him slowly walking to his car but I know he is watching me.There is a pause in his step and his head is slightly tilted in my direction.But this is my chance.I hastily change direction and slowly approach him as if I have to ask a question.He turns around, pulls out his gun, and pulls the trigger at point-blank range.The officer looks at his dead body and blown up head, looks at the dead plumber and comments "Two birds with one stone."He looks at his radio, breathes in, yells into the pager and shakes up his voice as if he were terrified."BACKUP NEEDED.MAN WAS RESISTING AND TRIED TO TAKE MY GUN.I HAD TO USE LETHAL FORCE".The officer looks into the distance, walks to his car and waits for backup.He looks down and mumbles "There can only be one Jack of all trades, and guess who's gonna be that person" before slyly laughing to himself.&#x200B;
