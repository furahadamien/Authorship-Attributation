You can't outsmart the Devil.All the old tales say so.Golden fiddles, riddles, tests of character...He always wins.I was different, though.I knew I could beat him at his own game - after all, how many people can claim to have found the key to immortality?Surely such an intellect could best the Prince of Lies.My intellect.So I made a deal.My soul in return for unlimited funding for my research.Once I had his infernal signature, I drank the elixir.I didn't even wait for him to leave, just pulled it out of my pocket and quaffed the lot.The look in his eyes...He should have been angry, but instead, he gloated.Turns out that the position of Devil is less an eternal damnation, and more a temporary position that gets passed on to whoever is foolish enough to seek immortality.He turned to ashes with a smile on his lips.Blessed nothingness was his.
