Youre fired.

The words burned my ears as they turned red with embarrassment.Of course I didnt need this job, but it really hits you right in the pride to be fired from a stupid office position.And for something as trivial as taking too much time for lunch, which I only did because some asshole caused a pile up right down the street last Tuesday.It was on the news and everything, but Jim, my boss, still blamed me.Apparently I should have just left my car in traffic and walked back to the office or something.I think hes had it out for me since the beginning.That sleazeball tried to put the moves on me my first day, but I just ignored him without trying to be overly rude.After he realized he wasnt getting anywhere, he had been trying to find an excuse to get me out of here.The whole office was filled with women and spineless men and he wasnt a fan of people who didnt kiss his ass.I mostly just kept the job because it was easy.What Jim doesnt doesnt know is Ive had it out for him too.As I packed up my stuff from my desk, my phone buzzed.It was Emilio, my PI on retainer.He watched my back for the people who wanted to steal my money.Nobody knew -I- had it, but they did know about Marceline Jovovich.Thats the name I use when I wanted to purchase anything that might arouse suspicion of nice, mousy Jane McFarlin.Thats not my real name either, but its what everyone here knows me as.Marceline was also the face that made me the money I have today.Its not exactly legal, what I do, but it sure it fun.Emilios text read, I found something you might want to see. Underneath was a picture of a first draft of a news article.It wasnt in a newspaper, just on the design layout.It read:

LOCAL MAN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT ON MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES FOUND GUILTY, FINED $5000

I chuckled to myself.Bingo.We had been trying to find dirt on Jim for a while now and this seems like it was buried pretty deep.No doubt he paid more to get it covered up so his business didnt go down the drain.I never saw it on the local news, so I guess it didnt get any further than this draft.I dont think Jim is the violent type, but I do wonder what happened to the person who was writing this article.I finished packing up my stuff and walked down to my car, giving Jim the nastiest glare I could muster on the way out.The rest of my coworkers were giving me pity looks, but I just smiled and got out of there as fast as possible.When I got to my busted up VW bug, I put the box in the front seat and texted Emilio back.Send it.

When I woke up the next morning, I turned on the TV to find Jims face plastered all over the news.Emilio had even located his victims and convinced them to talk.We could pay them more than Jim ever could.As I watched the news unfold, I decided that maybe this would be as good a time as any to take a vacation.Karma is delicious.
