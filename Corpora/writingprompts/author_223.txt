Two years ago, I and everyone else on Earth lost their sight in an event that came to be known as The Great Blinding.It was a day much like any other, but I've suddenly realized that my sight has returned to me.Overcome with surprise that I could once again see, I looked around, and upon taking in my immediate surroundings, I realize that every available wall, floor, and surface has been painted with the exact same message: "Don't Tell Them You Can See.""Hey, you!"they said."Can you see?""Nope," I replied, and they never found out.
