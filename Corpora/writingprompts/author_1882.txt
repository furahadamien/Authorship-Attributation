I guess my Dad didnt think this through.This is really started to get old.Im certain Im going to be here until a big meteor wipes out every single human.Ive made some friends.Some people really despise me here.They say Ive ruined their lives.That doesnt really seem fair, but oh well.Im never quite sure what someone thinks when they meet me here.I think it really scares them.I didnt do anything wrong, in my opinion.Just trying to do the right thing.A lot of things people heard about me arent true.Funny how things can spread like that.People show up here every moment.Some disappear just as soon as they appear, and that is very sad to me.It means no one knew or cared for them.People always kinda gravitate towards me.I welcome it, but Im always cautious because I dont know how someone will react when they realize who I am.Its not my face.People get my face all wrong.Its not my hair.Its just my name.Anyway.I think to myself a lot.Sometimes I catch myself taking out loud to myself.Someone is approaching me now.I should probably introduce myself.Ope, here he is.Hi

Hello there 

How are you?

Im good, and you

Im hanging in.Is this...heaven?

I hate when people ask me that.They dont get it yet.Afraid not, but no worries.Its not Hell, either

What is it?

Its purgatory.When we die, we come here.We have to stay here until our name is said by someone for the last time on Earth.

Oh, damn.Well I dont think Ill be here much longer.I might get stuck waiting for some creditors to realize Im dead and process my name one last time.

Thats kinda sad, I thought to myself.I guess I should ask his name.Whats your name?

Eric.Nice to meet you Eric

Whats yours, he asked.I hate this part.The realization that comes over people right now is always tough.Its...  uh..   Jesus.Christ, he said.Youre gonna be stuck here forever.

Not sure if he was saying my last name seriously, or taking it in vain.
