The hours pass slowly and are full of pain.My body grows weary with toil under the distant sun and amidst the red dust.But there is no rest for the slaves of the Corn King.We work the barren fields under the crack of the whip and the threat of worsetrying to force life out of something that long ago has died.My life was not always as terrible as it is now now.For I am old.I even remember the times before.&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Prior to serving the Corn King, I was a king myself.I held a small fiefdom to the north.It was nothing compared to the vast fertile tracts of the King, but it was free and happy.My people and I lived there fairly for many years.We farmed when we could and hunted when we could not.Some small part of our land had not been affected by the dark blight.But there was another reason I was king, another reason we were able to live as we did, a secret power that allowed me and my people to thrive in the wastelands.&nbsp;

The young, those who do not remember the times before, called it manna, like in the old stories: food from the heavens, a miracle.The truth is more mundane but just as mysterious.As a child, before the blight, I ate many cookies, candies, and other sweet things.These were more common and easy to come by then than they are now.One day I bought a package of sweet cookie sandwiches called Oreos.I knew little then of the significance that day would hold and the importance of it to my future survival.For when I opened that package, I saw a slip of paper inside; I had won a lifetime supply of Oreos.&nbsp;

After the darkness and the fall of the cities, the deliveries continued.No matter where I was, once a month, on the day of the new moon, a rider dressed all in black would find me.The rider would give me a box filled to the brim with packages of Oreos.At times they were Double Stuf.Sometimes Cakesters or Heads or Tails.One dark and evil day the entire box was Birthday Cake flavor.Those cookies and that rider allowed me to survive for years.They allowed me to found and feed a small town.I called it Fort Oreo.&nbsp;

We lived on that manna and what little we could farm.We lived in peace with other peoples, trading and bartering.That is, until the Corn King came.They say he never has enough.He seeks new fields to farm and people to enslave.He was accompanied by many men and with fire, smoke, and the screams of children.I burned the last of our reserves; he may kill us all but he would never learn my secret.I then fled to the south.I was found by one of his scouts and played dumb.I was brought to one of their camps to work as a field slave.My former subjects were either killed or brought to other places.I saw no one whom I recognized.&nbsp;
&nbsp;

It is now on the mysterious delivery that I pin my hopes.The moon has been waning.The rider will come tonight.&nbsp;

Night falls and I manage to escape escape from the bunkers.If I am found, they willI do not like to think on it.I wait, the time passes, I begin to lose hope, but thenlo!The rider comes.I see a shadow in the distance, by the light of the stars, growing closer.The rider approaches me and holds out a box.For the first time in many years, I speak to him.&nbsp;

I beg this strange hooded rider to deliver me from this place, just as he delivered so many boxes of Nabisco  Oreo Cookies in the past.He looks at me from under his hood.His eyes gleam and he seems deep in thought.Eventually he says, "you may accompany me and escape this present evil.But know that, if you do, many trials lie ahead.You will indeed change ere you return to the world of men.Whether it be for the better or the worse, I cannot say."I tell the rider that I will come.Although I am old, I still have vigor in my limbs and my mind is strong.The Oreos provided me with strength and a strange vitality all my life.&nbsp;

The figure then pulls back his hood and reveals a face.It is more wonderful and terrible than can be described in words.I turn my eyes and look elsewhere for many minutes before I can bear to look directly at him.The figure speaks to me, "come, for there is much work to do."
