My eyes well up as I gaze at my phone.Loved and accepted for who I am?For most of my life I hadnt accepted myself for who I was because I didnt think I was suffering as much as others I knew in my situation.Still, it took me many years to truly say it out loud and tell others of my sorrow, my struggles, my pain.I place my phone down and rubbed my red eyes.We had gotten back from my parents and I was tired.I had a long day and the thought of rest was like water to a thirsty man.My feet travel to my room and I stopped suddenly.He was kneeling there with a box in hand and my heart fluttered.It was like that Christmas years ago and I didnt know that I could feel so much yet again.Knox, he started and smiled; that grin I knew when he had been up to something, six years ago I asked you to be my bride, and now I am asking you to be my husband. 

My trembling hands cupped his face - the man I loved for so long - and I leaned down to kiss his forehead.This man had been with me when the realization of what I was and accepting myself had flooded my whole being.He was there to tell me I was the boy that I have always wanted to be and no matter what he was by my side forever.He never once rejected me and for that I was truly grateful.Yes, my voice was a whisper and I truly felt loved and accepted.
