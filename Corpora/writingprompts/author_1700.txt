I didn't always have this money.I was poor growing up.My mom worked 3 jobs to feed us.She barely kept us housed.We lived in a run down shack in the middle of the ghetto.It wasn't much.2 bedrooms, one bath, but it housed all 4 of us kids.Unfortunately, momma died at work, and the house was foreclosed on.All of us were taken in by relatives, except for me.I had a 35 hour a week job at Jimmy Zipp's sandwiches.It was minimum wage, but it kept the bedroom I was renting from somebody paid.I was going to school online while working at Jimmy Zipp's.I then got my associates degree in database management.I then got my real first full time job.Ahh, I remember my first few paychecks.I bought a trailer home on the outskirts of town for me and my 3 other siblings.Then I bought my own land.My story would end there, on a much happier note, but that's not the end of the story.This is my story of how I managed to fire my boss.After buying a trailer home on the outskirts of town with my first 5 paychecks, and buying my brothers and sister a house, I decided to splurge.What could be better than having my own land AND my own home?I looked up cheap land, and the first thing I saw was desert land in Arizona.I bought it on the spot.10K for 5 miles worth of land?I'm in!My only sister didn't like the fact that I was buying land.She thought it could go towards a nest egg.I told her this:  "Angel,we had hard lives.We're not going to live very long.At least this way, we have something when one of us dies".She sadly concured.The land I bought was nothing, really.No access to water.Nothing.Just some desert land in Arizona.I figured I'd use it as coyote hunting land and sell the pelts for an extra few dollars to supplement my income.I hated coyotes.After one bit off the leg of my favorite cat and killed my sister's dog, I made sure that I was going to kill them to no end.So, for my first vacation that I would ever take as a man with a full time job, I decided to go to my property in Arizona and hunt for some coyotes.It started off well enough.I shot a few with my bow.I got 10!But I noticed something funny about them.They were moving rather slowly on my property.Slow enough to where I could simply throw rocks at their heads and they'd simply fall down dead.I did that to 15 or 20 coyotes  When I picked up their pelts, I noticed that their lips were wet and green.Didn't matter.I simply sold the pelts to the tannery down the street

"Jack", the tanner said...

"I'm not going to give you as much money as I would.These yotes seemed to have ingested a lot of copper.I had to remove it from their hides.Here's $30,000.Normally, I would pay about 140,000 for this many pelts."I didn't care.It was 30K  more than I would have had if I were still working at Jimmy Zipp's sandwiches like I used to.And the cute, middle aged lady down the street thanked me because a yote injured her cat too.I went to the gift shop down the street to buy some nice things.I pledged to spend only 1,000 on myself, and give the rest to my brothers and sister.Right now is Jack time.I walked into the gift shop.I talked to the shopkeep.I asked "How much is that watch over there?It looks rather nice".The storekeeper said "Oh, it's not too much.It's about $360."I was shocked at the price."360$?What's it made of, baby's teeth?"The shopkeeper said "No, silly, it's made out of silver that was mined 10 miles down the street.What, you can't afford this?"Normally, I would say "no", because I'm used to earning 20K a year at Jimmy Zipp's.But this was my first office job.I was making 3X that.Plus I had this extra 30,000$"

I pulled out 4  Benjamins I had in my pocket and I told the shopkeep "Sold!".I used that money to buy my first item that was ever made out of a precious metal before.It was a handcrafted sterling silver watch.It was the finest watch you could ever look at.I then used the change to buy myself a steak dinner.I've never had a steak dinner before.Back when my mom was alive, we'd have Salisbury steak.That's the closest we'd ever get.I went back to my property in AZ and pitched a camp.When I woke up, I saw a weak, but hungry coyote coming after me.I picked up a bow and I shot it, dead in the head.It dropped.I saw a bunch of sickly looking yotes around me.They couldn't even catch up to the neighbor's cat.I noticed there were a bunch of dead coyotes on my property, all leaving a trail.I followed the trail....When I followed the trail, I noticed there was a giant, green colored pond in the middle of my property.There were a few dead coyotes on the pond.God, it stank.It smelled like old pennies and rotting flesh.That's when I realized I had copper on my property!I immediately called a lawyer and we arranged to sign a contract with a mining company.Within a week, the contract was signed and I was officially 300 million dollars richer.My vacation was ending, so I took the next plane out of Phoenix and I jetted back home.There was a little delay.I phoned in work and told them I was going to be a bit late.The department lead was rude to me and told me if I didn't show up there within a reasonable time, they were going to write me up.This was uncharacteristic of them.Usually, they're extremely kind.Something's up.I played along to their meanness though.I theoretically didn't need the job.I had my own money now and I could tell them to kiss my ass.But because I didn't want to forget where I came from, I stuck with the job.I rented a car and I zipped it straight to downtown, where I parked the car.I was still reeking of coyote guts.When I got back to work, I noticed that my old manager wasn't there anymore.He was kicked upstairs, into another department, at another branch.We got this new guy named Dejerrick.No wonder why things were different.We had a new guy here.And the guy was a douchebag, to say the least.Dejerrick was a portly African American male, who honest to god, was the scum of the earth.He always wore bling wherever he went.He was short, ugly and stank of cigarettes.But lord, he had an ego.He acted arrogant and aggressive.Like he was compensating for something.The guy thought because he had street cred, it automatically transferred into a corporate environment.The other African Americans at work hated him.They thought he was reinforcing negative stereotypes about African Americans.Every negative stereotype about African Americans you could think of, my manager embodied them.My best friend Jimmy, who was also black, hated him the most.I knew better than to judge other black people because of Jimmy.My co-workers didn't because they didn't really experience black people a lot.I did because I grew up in the inner city.Other people at work especially hated DeJerrick.It broke my heart because Jimmy got some of the brunt of the hate too,  just because of the color of his skin.Dejerrick could pick up on Jimmy's disdain for him.Dejerrick made sure to turn Jimmy's life into a living hell.Jimmy wasn't like "all the other black people".We struck up a friendship after I saw a Black Sabbath tattoo on his arm.We were both fans of heavy metal.I also liked the fact that his name was Jimmy and I loved my time working at Jimmy Zipp's.We hung out together every day after work.But not even Jimmy knew that I was a multi-millionaire.To Jimmy, I was just the guy who lived in a trailer on the outskirts of town.He drove a Ford Focus.I drove a Hyundai Accent.We were two very ordinary people with two very ordinary lives.Jimmy just called me over the phone."Hey Jack, let's hit up a metal show over in Finland.I heard from one of my buddies over there that Finland's about to legalize MJ.They're not going to make it official though until next week.Wanna hit up Finland in about a month?Think about it, man.Heavy metal, Finnish women AND weed!".I responded to Jimmy "No, man.I have this database I have to build.DeJerrick wants it done by next week, or else I'll be fired".Jimmy responded: "Oh god, doesn't that idiot know that databases like that take at least 2 weeks to build?"I then told Jimmy in a laughing manner "Yeah, that's why it's going to be built so shoddily that he's going to end up getting yelled at by the CEO about how crappy the build is."I show up to work the next day.On my break, I called up my stockbroker and I told him to invest in some marijuana stocks.They were going for 50 cents a share.I knew those things were going to explode in value soon.I just didn't know how soon.I  called up my stockbroker."Juan, I'd like to buy 2 million dollars worth of Mary Jane and Herb's Green Grass Company"

He said to me "Meh, it's your money".
