"I have come...I have come.. to.. to..." Braur's voice trailed off, his wrinkled hand trembling on his cane.He lifted it slowly, poking what appeared to be a flickering fire in an elegant dress."Oy, stop that now Mr. Braur," Chorus said kindly, her voices modulating in and out."Would you like to sit down?"A chair materialized out of the moonlight."No...I have come here..." his eyes began to glaze over.Chorus gently held his shoulder."Come now" it said, a grandmother, "where is your assistant, how did you get all the way up here".For a moment he seemed lucid, poised, annoyed."Damn assistant, never pays attention, real busy, no patience."He stood up straighter, his cane clattering to the ground, "damn, why am I here again?"He looked over to Chorus, almost grumpy "you shouldn't put up with me you know, should just fry my ass like every other hero who gets close".If she could, Chorus would have smiled.Memories seemed to flicker within its core.The darkness, spilling through portals across the city.Her fortress, in ruins.Bodies of villains scattered across the streets like so many seeds in the wind.Braur, his body bloodied and his face defiant."I have come to offer you, and the remaining villains, an alliance against the darkness."Braur, struggling against the darkness, standing alone to hold "them" back as the villains channeled one final spell.She would never forget him then.The look on his face when the spell fired.His arm missing, his eyes gouged, and a smile on his lips.He had raised his spear.. and collapsed.In the present, Chorus guided Braur back to his room in the Hall of Heroes."No, I think you've earned this".The flames seemed to smile.The League, on the other hand, was going to regret not taking good care of her oldest friend.
