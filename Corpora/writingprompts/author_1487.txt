"Quit Smoking Harry!It will kill you!"begs the man on the television, he's some news anchor who became a big talking head and got famous.Whatever, fuck him.Click goes the remote and I'm off to the sports games.San Diego Raiders versus the London Jaguars - go sports ball, wooooo.With a sigh I light up my next cigarette, inhaling so deeply that the damn thing is almost entirely gone in a single puff.I let it stew in my lungs for a while, reveling in the knowledge that the foul black smoke is seeping into my body.After a short wait, I breath out before finishing off the cigarette with my next breath.The raider's QB pauses mid snap as the refs call an official time out.Robert Lynch looks confused for a minute as the ref runs over to tell him something, but then his confusion turns to pity and he turns to the camera.God damn it all I know where this is going."Harry, please stop smoking."He says in a somber tone, "You're my hero.I don't want you to die."I almost care enough to put down the unlit cigar (vanilla rum flavored, yay).Almost.It's been twelve fucking years.Why can't they see me for me and not the hero that they want to see?Why do they have to see Harry Blunt, savior of the god damned world?They hold me in such high regards, it's honestly scary.I've done so much for them that, even if I nuked Canada they'd still worship the ground at my feet.They want to believe that I am someone bigger than just the tired old man who is sick of living.I miss my kids and my wife and my family and even my god damned dog.It's been twelve fucking years of loneliness.People can't see me for who I really am anymore."Just let me die people, let it go..." I mutter as I bring the lighter to my next cancer stick."I'm so god damn tired..."
