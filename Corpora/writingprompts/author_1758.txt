Ol' God went down to Georgia.He was lookin' to Fiddle n' Chill.He saw Johnny on the grind and said "Me and you!Its time!And you best make it ill!"Floating head called a Cromulon happened along, said "SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT."And Charlie said "I'll Hank Hill your ass any day, lemme me tell you what."God says "I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a deity, too.I once made a bush catch fire, thats the lit shit that I do..

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, Charmander, but thoughts and prayers are due.I'm hardcore perched atop the skulls of millions!How many wars were started over you?"The boy said, "My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin,

But I just wiped my ass with one fictional character and I can pretend to do it again."Johnny, sharpen up that edge and make sure the drop is hard.Because this song is copywrit protected under Georgia's laws..

And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold,

Remember that episode where Bart sold Milhouse his soul?God opened up with heavy bass and he said, "My shit on fleek, yo."And fire flew from his turntable as he gave it the People's Elbow.And he pranced across the stage like Night Man making an evil hiss.Followed by some shoddy choreography and it looked something like shit.
