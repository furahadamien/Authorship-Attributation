I hold so much power.I feed off of death.Humans eat and drink to stay alive, but I just kill.I'd never given a thought to dying myself.There were seven billion people on this planet and it's been a very long time since I could take lives faster than new ones appeared.But once where there were seven billion, now there are seven, and I'm the cause of it.I invaded their minds, controlled them.I made the nukes fall like rain.I felt so many deaths occur at once and for just a minute I felt my power reach unprecedented levels.That was always my goal: to rise above whatever or whomever created me.But as soon as it came, it went.And for the first time in my millions of years of existence, I felt life within veins; I felt my own life.I also felt it draining.Now my goal is salvation.Dozens survived my onslaught.I picked them off, one by one just to keep the feeling of being alive inside myself.But it seeped away again.Six.I feel remorse.I pity the humans that remain and the ones that have fallen.But most prominently I envy them.They get to feel.They get to choose.They get to believe.And I  I get to kill.Four.The man cried as he held his dead wife in his arms, burying his tear stained face into her still warm neck.His three kids are in another room of the bunker, completely oblivious to what's happening.They know something's wrong, but do not have the age to comprehend.One.For once, I felt I did the "right" thing.I gave the children peaceful deaths.It was what the humans would call a "kindness".Being kind was never my forte.But now I can sympathize, as I feel pain as they do."I'm sorry," I said to the dying man.He looked at me, but didn't seem surprised to see me."You did this," he said."It had to happen," I said."Humanity couldn't recover from what I'd done.""Why did you do this?""I do not know."There was silence."You're the last one," I said."What about my children?""They didn't deserve to starve to death.I gave them mercy."At this point the man had already lost so much, he didn't seem to have any more tears to spare."And what about me?"he asked."You and I die together," I answered.There was silence for many minutes.Then I felt his consciousness disappearing for the last time."I am no longer alone," I said.As his heart stopped beating, my skin flew away in flakes and I turned to ash.My body, my consciousness, my purpose, all disappearing forever.And I felt peace.
