nonpoisonous
And honestly, you dont even really get that nauseous after the fourth or fifth time, Captain Zerk explained, passing paper towels to Matt Damon.Suddenly, a bright flash of light\-\-a ship appears behind theirs.What in the\-\-?

Incoming message, Commander Zerk, chimes the ships command station.Zerk waves his hand impatiently, and the message plays.Hello *XPS412*, this is *Red Hawk*.This is your first warning\-\-return Damon to us unharmed or we will be forced to take action.

Zerk appears confused.He presses a button and begins dictating a response.Hello *Red Hawk*.It was my understanding that with the Earths increasingly depleted resources, lightspeed travel has become prohibitively expensive.How are you funding this expedition?

Zerk waits patiently for a response, looking questioningly at Matt Damon.Damon shrugs, still wiping vomit from his shirt.Incoming message, Commander Ze\-

Yeah, yeah, ok play it.

The command station beeps huffily, and the message plays after a staticky pause....That is irrelevant.Return Damon to us unharmed or we will be forced to take action.

Zerk shrugs.He presses a button on the command station, and light speed travel is initiated once more.Matt Damon hurls as a white light engulfs *XPS412*.When the ship slows down, Zerk looks around.Nothing around for light years.He smiles, wondering if he will be knighted once he gifts Damon to the Grand Chancellor.Collecting Earth celebrities has become something of a hobby among the galaxys elite, who especially love action movies.A bright flash of light once more.What the f\-\-

*XPS412*\-\-this is your last warning!Return Damon to us unharmed or we will capsize you.We have an elite attack squad currently crawling around the bottom of your ship, they have been instructed to enter and destroy until Damon has been returned.

Zerk has already begun responding.**Two** light speed jumps??Aren't you guys in the most debt in the entire\-\-

A loud bang is heard by all as an explosion goes off somewhere along the underbelly of the ship.Damon looks apologetically at Zerk.Zerk is about to say something when another explosion goes off, this time accompanied by the activation of the ships emergency lights.OKAY!Okay okay, *Red Hawk*, look, Im returning Matt Damon.Alright?Get your squad off my boat so I can enable repair drones.

Zerk turns off the mic and resentfully removes the magnetic cuffs around Matt Damons ankles.I dont want to be a dick but *The Martian* wasnt even that good, I dont get why youre such a big deal, Zerk mutters.He turns on the mic one last time.*Red Hawk*, Im sending Damon back to Earth now.I hope whatever you sold was worth it.

A long pause.Send him to the ship.

What, why?I can just beam him to Earth right\-\-

SEND HIM TO THE SHIP.

Zerk's face goes slack, he finally understands.We are nothing without him, the radio says, before going silent one last time.
