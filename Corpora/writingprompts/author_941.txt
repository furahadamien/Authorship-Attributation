Me:"Hey demon,what now.I have immortality,whatchu gonna do?"Devil:"Fuck you,man."Me:"That's what i thought,now your my lil bitch.Unlimited money and immortality,suck on that dumb bitchhhhhhhh."Hangs up
The devil walks around his room thinking about his next move as he isnt going to admit that he was duped by a mere mortal.After some time alone thinking,he remembered that true immortality is when one does not fall easily and can respawn.However a human is not capable of these abilities,he phoned me again.Devil:"How are you sustaining immortality?"Me:"Why would i want to tell you?"Devil:"At least treat it as a compensation of the unlimited funds to me,asshole?"Me:"Ok, fine.My body can regenerate over and over in my current state"

Devil:"That's all i needed to hear."The Devil then assembled a team of demons to pursue me.The Devil waited for his underlings to return but   one day,two day,three days,.....They never did.Furious,he came to catch me himself."I" was captured,tortured and questioned by the devil himself but what he didnt know was that I knew his every secret and weakness through experimentinghsi underlings but what he has is just a clone of me and nothing else.When it was time,I showed up to where my clone was.The devil went crazy and attacked me but i killed him and slaughtered him like a dog with all the weakness i knew of him,
silver,holy water,you name it.I grabbed his head and returned to my base,and told what was left of the underlings,"bow to your new master".That day was when i realised how good it feels to become a DEVIL.It's the second time i wrote a prompt,please give me feedback if can.
