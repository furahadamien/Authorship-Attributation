I almost drop my phone out of shock.Did I just see that?I slowly approach the pillar, looking around to see if anyone had seen what I had seen.I step close enough to reach my hand out, ready to touch the pillar."Dad!"Michael suddenly appears next to me from the other side of the pillar.I breathe a huge sigh of relief.My eyes just played a trick on me.Walking through a solid brick wall.Ridiculous, right?"Dad!Why didn't it work?I should have seen the Hogwarts Express!It didn't work!"I chuckled a bit to myself.He inadvertantly pranked me right back.He was certainly my son, all right.Still, may as well play along."You must have missed the pillar, sport!Give it another try!""Oh, okay, dad."And it happened in a flash.He walked right into the pillar again.I was dumbfounded.I shiverred.I did see it the first time.I stood there unmoving and in shock.What was happening?"Michael?""Dad!It's not working!"He walked to me from behind the pillar again.He looked at me as if this was expected.I mean, to him it would be.I told him he could walk through a solid wall.He was only confused as to why he was still on the King's Cross platform.I stammered."I...  What..."  I reached out to the pillar, knowing not what to expect.I closed my eyes and reached straight ahead.I felt nothing.I opened my eyes and saw my arm, but no hand.I was reaching into the pillar.I pulled my arm back out and looked at my hand."Dad?What's wrong?"I looked at my son, and then the pillar again.I decided to try it myself.I closed my eyes once again, and walked forward at a brisk pace.I took several steps, stopped, and openned my eyes.I was still on the same platform.I turned around to see the solid pillar and my son peeking around the corner."See, Dad?It's broken or something."I rushed back around to where my son was.I looked at the pillar and my son.I smiled a little.It was incredible!We could walk through this pillar.I jogged forward again.What an amazing experience!WHAP!I found myself on the ground.My face was sore.A few people stopped and looked at me.The giggled as they walked away.Stupid fool ran straight into a pillar."Dad?Are you okay?""Hunh?What happened?""I told you.It must be broken."I got on my feet and dusted myself off.I approached the pillar and reached out with my hand once again.I pressed my hand against the brick.It was cold and solid.I pushed harder.Nothing.Both hands.Nothing.I tried harder.Nothing.I noticed my son had began pushing as well.Nothing.I took a step back.I looked the pillar over floor to ceiling and back.What the hell?Then suddenly, a slight shock covered me."You walked through the wall, didn't you?"I spun around.I was face to face with a large, strange man dressed in black."Umm..."  I glanced back at the pillar and him again."You and your son.You both walked through a solid wall.I know.I was watching."He lowered his sunglasses to look me over, then pushed them back into place."I'm going to need you and your son to come with me.""What?Why?""Please come with me.""Why?What happened?""There was a glitch in the Matrix.Please come with me."
