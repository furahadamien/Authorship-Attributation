Bit late to the party, but heres my attempt.I havent written for years and years and barely read books anymore - I like reading the replies of others on prompts posted here but it often makes me sad I no longer write.However for some reason this inspired me!So even if its bad, even if no one reads it, here we go.Thank you for this, its reignited my love for words just a little bit.It was dark.Too dark to see.The kind of dark that made your heart flutter inside your chest.An all consuming dark that amplifies every single little sound like it were a harsh whisper rasped directly in your ear.The hum of a generator.A lazy breeze weaving drunkenly through the cobbled streets.The scream of the man sprawled across from me sudden and hellish snaps my mind back into focus.I couldnt see him but of course I knew he was there laying under a threadbare blanket clutched tightly to his heaving chest.He was the perfect neighbour in most respects.Kept to himself.Never felt the need for small talk.The only downside were the gut wrenching screams hed unleash at all hours, always without warning, always tinged with something almost not human.He was well and truly mad.And my only companion.I call him Shrieker.My life has never been any different.Not to my knowledge, anyhow.Im a street rat.An urchin.Undesirable, a pest.The busy streets are coloured with red faces either looking down on me in shame or anger, or embarrassment.Im used to it.I know who I am, I accept it.I was born nothing, I am  nothing and I will always be.Nothing.I have no problem with that.Except tonight something is slightly off in my dingy dark little world of nothing.As shriekers cries fade off into the night, a silence takes over.The dark is easing.I squint, searching for the source of invasive light.I hear a new sound.The soft patter of footfall.My fluttering heart begins to pound.Shriekers motionless form begins to take shape; I can just about see his pale white face hidden behind wisps of greasy long hair.The light becomes unbearable and I whimper bringing my arm to my eyes.thump thump thump the footsteps grow louder still and I brace myself for what may come - I have been spat on, been kicked, burnt and berated, never has a visitor to our dark little corner been kind.The footfall stops.I adopt a familiar stance and bring my knees up, drop my shoulders and head, keeping my arms up.I am small, I am weak, I am unimportant.Just keep walking.Please.I squeeze my eyes shut tight, ready.Nothing happens.I open my eyes a crack, peeking through my arms.I see something strange - a wry smile.I open them further, now curious.Knelt before me was a boy not much older than myself, or how old I imagined Id be.Soft brown curls framed his face and fell slightly in front of pale blue eyes.His skin looked soft and unmarred by abuse, unlike mine which was crisscrossed with ugly scars and dirt.No one so clean had ever come so close to me.His smile broadened as I lowered my arms further and my mouth fell slack in confusion.Hello he said softly, laying a hand on my arm.What is your name? 

I... I stuttered dumbly for a moment, trying to think straight.I had no name.I dont know.

He waved his hand absently Not to worry he said, We can fix that.My name is Peter, Peter Pan.Id like to speak with you, if thats alright. 

Me?Why me?

His head tilted slightly and I could feel his eyes taking in every part of my wretched appearance.Finally, he said you are lost.As am I.Us lost boys need to stick together, dont we?

It wasnt a question, more a statement of fact.Every instinct told me to not trust him but those words broke me.In that moment I knew Id do anything he asked.I was his.Unable to speak, I merely nodded.Startling me he laughed in delight and embraced me.Drawing back, Peter cupped my face with cool hands and chirped Good, good!Excellent!Fantastic!You wont regret this, that much I can promise you.You and I, were going to have grand adventures.Just you wait and see, the most grandest of adventures! 

I felt the corners of my mouth tugging upwards.Hope, warm and hot flushed through me.Hes going to save me.I dont need to be nothing.I can be someone!Something!Peter drew back and sat crossed legged in front of me.He placed a lamp directly next to us, illuminating the entirety of the space between us.His expression grew more sober, however that wry smile remained.He said, Before we get any further, I have something for you.Something I can only describe as magic.Itll take away that pain I see in your heart.The pain thats eating away at it there.  He reached into the folds of the thick green coat draped across his shoulders and produced a small glittering vial.The light of the lamp reflected through it, casting out a dazzling display of ever changing colours.It was beautiful.Peter used his thumb to pop the lid off of the vial and leaned in close.I could feel the warmth of his breath on my face and the weight of his stare.It can make you fly he whispered with a wink.He lifted the vial close to my nose and said Breathe in, breathe in as deep as you can. Without pause I sucked in air through my nose, my chest expanding painfully.I kept going for as long as I could while Peter gestured encouragingly.Finally he moved the vial away and I exhaled loudly.I blinked, bringing new air into my lungs.What was supposed to happen?When would it?I looked at Peter and began to ask how long.... but the words died in my throat.Prickling heat trickled down through my body, all the way to my toes.Sensation began crashing through me fast like a malevolent wave rumbling into shore.Violent shakes racked my body and it felt so good, so very very good.As my eyes rolled back into my head, I saw Peter watching me, his smile now wicked.As darkness took me once more, I felt... euphoria.
