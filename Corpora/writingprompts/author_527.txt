It had been an incredibly difficult few years since Michael's wife died.The sudden loss caused a mental breakdown which took months to recover from.He had to sell the house, lost his job.But at least now he was trying.He could see the world again.Michael took up a third job for a little extra money, a cleaner.Working late nights after places close up.It wasn't great, but it was what he had to do.One night his company sent him to a dentist's office for a job.Starting in the consulting rooms and then the waiting room, the finished up in the staff kitchen.Getting to work on the dishes, he picked up a mug

"#864,372 Dad?What kind of stupid mug is that to buy for someone?"Not thinking anything else of it, he headed back to the one bedroom apartment he called home.It was 3am when Michael got home.Heading straight for the kitchen, he boiled the kettle and made himself a cup of tea.It was always this time he would get emotional, the nights were the hardest.Never managing to completely suppress his tears.He returned to the living room to sit in the dim light of the side lamp.Stifling a sob at the memories.Then the creak of sound as the door to the bedroom opened."Dad?""Hey Son, sorry I didn't mean to wake you."Michael replied as he wiped the tears from his face."I thought I'd be home earlier tonight, but I have tomorrow night off so I promise I'll make your game"."Don't worry about it Dad, I know you're trying for both of us.I miss her too."Taking his son into his arms and planting a kiss on his cheek, Michael told the boy that he loves him and sent him off to bed.He then picked up the photo he has of the three of them on the coffee table, before placing it back down next to his mug of slowly cooling tea.Reading "#1 Dad".-----------
