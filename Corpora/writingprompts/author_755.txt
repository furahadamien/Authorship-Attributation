Goat_Feathers
So you are who he went to be with...He only stayed with us for about two years, so it doesn't surprise me that you don't know where he came from.I don't know where he came from when he started staying with us.I called him "Blackie" because his coat was so dark.Was his brother with him too?Looked just like him, only bigger and well... dumber.No?Too bad.So there was this one time I'm in school, and it's late spring and hot and the A/C is out.So we have the doors and windows open trying to get any little breeze that we can.And in the open door walks Blackie.The teacher was reading, and as Blackie walks in she stops.He walked right by and and over to me.Sits down facing the front like, "Ok, I'm here now.Let's learn."Nobody said a word.Finally the teacher asked me to take him out and I did.But that's the kind of dog he was.Didn't matter what you were doing, he just wanted to be a part of it.Man I miss that dog.
