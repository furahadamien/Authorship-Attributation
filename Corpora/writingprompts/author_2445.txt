My name doesn't matter.You probably know about me, but if you don't, that doesn't matter, either.Against my better judgement, I published this story anonymously to the internet because my girlfriend wanted me to.She's the only person I really care about, so, well... yeah... publishing this.I never gave myself a supervillain name.If you're good enough, the public will give you one or maybe even several that will stick, but giving one to yourself is just pretentious.Most people call me the Grey Man.It's kind of stupid, and an unnecessary allusion to Robert Jordan, but I'm fine with it, and it's what stuck.I am a ghost, a superhuman who is, to varying degrees, unaffected by the powers of other supers.My powers are so strong that I can negate the defensive powers of my fellow supers just by shooting them with a gun, often to... messy results.I once let my powers get to my head.I was seventeen, and I needed the money, so I decided to rob a bank.I'd used my powers to pick fights with arrogant supers before (and once knifed one who thought his powers gave him the right to try to take a guy's girlfriend away from him, even though she wasn't interested; yes, the same girlfriend I still have today), but this was my first step down the path of true supervillainy.It was a Tuesday in early October, cold, dark, and cloudy.I, shall we say, "borrowed", my narcissistic, abusive alcoholic of a mother's glock and used my neighbor's hijab (yes, I asked her for it.She hadn't worn it since she moved out of her dad's place and I paid her fifteen dollars for it anyways), a handkerchief, and a pair of mirrored sunglasses as my disguise.I walked all the way down to the bank.I got a couple odd looks due to my costume, but most people probably assumed I was just another wasted wannabe superhero from some poor white trash neighborhood (the poor part was correct, but we actually had a surprising amount of diversity, as evidenced by my neighbor having a hijab).It was a long way, and I was sweaty all over and dead tired by the time I got there.Still, I soldiered on.I was confident in my powers and determined to strike it rich, no matter the cost.I burst into the bank, taking the glock out of the plastic bag."Give me all your goddamn money!"I shouted, waving the handgun menacingly at the tellers."W-what?"One of them, a perky-looking blonde I actually got to know later, and who my girlfriend absolutely *loathes,* asked."No bullshit!"I shouted "Give me all the fucking money you can fit in this bag!As many hundreds as you can find!Now, dumbass!"While they started desperately scraping up as many Benjamins as they possibly could, I made a mistake.Well, several.but I was a kid who had no idea what he was doing.This was just the worst one, the one that screwed me over.In my egotism, I actually began to *want* to have a fight.I *wanted* someone to call on a superhero on me so I could curb-stomp him and gain instant notoriety.So, when I noticed a guy calling 911, I let him, instead of shooting the bastard like I should have if I had any amount of common sense.They were just handing me back my paper bag, full to the brim with hundred dollar bills, when the cops arrived.Not a superhero, *the cops*.Still, being an idiotic little boy, I thought my ultra jacked-up superpower immunity somehow protected me from *bullets*.Mundane, ordinary, *completely non-superpower-related lead bullets*.So, I turned my gun on them, instead of running like fuck.Luckily for me, this was a nice part of town, and they weren't me to actually fight back against the *fucking police* unless I had super-powerful superpowers (Which I kind of did have, but not the kind that would actually help me), so actually trying to fight them caught them off guard and scared the absolute shit out of them, like Ungern-Sternberg's cavalry charges against machine gun fire.I was fucking stupid back then, but, on the plus side, I was a crazy mothefucker.I killed three of them before any of them got of a single shot, despite, at that point, being woefully inexperienced with a handgun.It's when they started firing back that the trouble began.A few bullets whizzed past me, marking the last few seconds of my egotistical delusions of invincibility.Then one caught me right in the eye.I don't know how I survived.It should've gone right into my brain and killed me, but I guess luck was on my side that day or something.I kept shooting with the hand holding the gun, while the hand holding the money bag was held up to my eye, trying to block the blood flow.I was careful not to get any blood on the precious contents of the bag.I fled behind the desk, where the bank tellers were busy getting the hell out of dodge.I reloaded the glock, then continued firing.Then, I ran out of bullets.There were still hundreds of panicked customers in the bank, some of which were injured.My desperate, panicked mind came up with an idea...I threw my mother's glock at the security camera, which was surprisingly close to me.It hit, and it completely shattered the camera, doing a lot better than I hoped.Then, I took the hijab, handkerchief, and the shattered remains of the sunglasses off.And my gloves for good measure.I hid the bag of money under my shirt, ran out into the crowd when I was pretty sure nobody was looking, and pretended to be a rather fat injured bystander while the police searched the building.Once I got a few blocks away, I took the bag out of my shirt and ran like hell.A new supervillain came to town the next day, and the entire bank robbery incident was forgotten (though my mother did ask where her gun was and beat me with a stick when I told her I didn't know.She didn't even notice the missing eye thing), but I used to still be very surprised that I actually got away with it.Then I remembered that the Stupidinator's powers could make people stupid, scatter-brained, and extremely unlucky.I, of course, was immune, so I couldn't blame him for my stupid actions, though.Didn't stop me from killing him.He was an obnoxious bastard, and I'm pretty sure he was using his own powers on himself.I learned from my mistakes, bought a nice suit, handgun, and custom mask from a place that didn't ask questions, and acquired grander ambitions than mere money, and with these new assets, I have become the villain that killed more heroes than anyone else in this entire state, but having learned from my mistakes, I do not let this get to my head.I carefully plan my crimes, just shoot dangerous enemies that I face, and, most importantly, know when to run like fuck.So, yeah.I hope my girlfriend is happy with this, because I'm sure as hell not posting anymore delicate information about myself....Unless she gives me the puppy dog eyes.I can never resist those.
