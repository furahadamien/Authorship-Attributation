IT_IS_A_PLANE
I awoke with a massive jolt my body spasming and locking up taking in deep breaths.My vision blurred a faint oily shadow in the shape of a man stands over me."I think he's waking up!"In the distance another set of voices roar "Bout bloody time too" "He should've paid attention!""What a bloody idiot!""Oh c'mon guys anyone could make that mistake."From the back of the cinema a voice shouted "He walked into a busy road!"I sat up my vision clearing and seeing...me?"Holy shit" I spasmed out scooched away from me hitting the theatre walls.The theatre roared into laughter and then I saw them, there was at least twenty no thirty me's they all looked like me but each wearing different clothing some looking older or younger."Where...where am I?"I spoke panicked the other me stood up wearing what appeared to be military uniform from World War One at a glance he appeared English."I'm sorry to say you've died" he said flatly as though he has said this to many others."Died?How?No.This place can't be real I'm having a nightmare, yes a nightmare" I said rambling on until I received a short sharp smack to my face.The solder stood over me "No son, you're dead and this is where we all go".I looked around and took in the room, it was like a 1950s era cinema but much larger than usual the seats a dark red worn velvet with off cream coloured walls.The surreal site of seeing all these me's made it hard not to make my head spin even seeing a anothet me walking down the isle offering snacks."Food, drink, bets, we have it all here!".I'm gonna stop here cause I have work.
