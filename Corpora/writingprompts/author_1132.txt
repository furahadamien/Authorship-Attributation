I remember a line from a TV show that was like, "I had hundreds of plans in my life, and only one of them got me killed!"That's--that *was*--my life, and apparently that *is* this book.Jesus Christ, there's a lot of death in here.It's a miracle I lived as long as I did.Flipping through page after page, I remember the ridiculous things I used to do, with my friends, with Jake, on my own, everything.All these things that I thought to myself, "how bad could it be?"and here I am looking at how bad it could have been.But I guess if there's all that bad, maybe...

Jake.Jump over to October 15th, 2004.The last of the BBQ Fridays of the season.Select "let Jake crash on the couch."Play.It turns out Jake turns into a real asshole sometime in the late 2000s and even in what would be now, nobody in my family barely speaks to him.I don't care, I get to see him grow old.It's like when I first discovered Wikipedia, walking down all these what-ifs and different timelines and seeing how they bounce off of one another.February 18, 1985."Choose Mom."Play.Jake's less of an asshole there, somehow, and apparently I never stopped talking to that Jake.October 31, 1988."Let Jake be Batman."Play.Doesn't change much, but it's great watching him run around and exasperate either parent in the timelines.August 12, 2002."Accept job in Alaska."Play.Long-distance calls makes keeping in touch with family difficult, but we ICQ from time to time.He's still alive there.It's Asshole Jake, but he's still there.I die earlier, though.October 15th, 2019."Don't drink."Play....well, I continue living, I guess.Not much of a life at this point, but it's something.Think I'll keep watching these other timelines instead.
