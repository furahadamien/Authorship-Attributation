"I'll take it", I said to the manager of the antique store.He had been describing the ceremonial katana to me for the past ten minutes.It was supposed to be three hundred years old, used only once by some monarch in Japan to exact revenge on his thieving half brother.I paid the final $700 I had left in my bank account to the manager and walked out, ready to deal the final blow to my little thieving friend.As I got into my car to head to his house, I thought about how exhausting the past few weeks had been.I had already implemented half of my revenge plans.From what I heard in news, he was extremely devasted.I had already killed his only son last week.An entire kilogram of HCN mixed in his school's cafeteria food.Some may say that that was too much, but I had to be sure that he would be dead.Sure, other students at his school suffered, but collateral damage happens in any sort of cleansing.His wife, though, she was a tough nut.An ex-LAPD ironically.She was not happy with the marriage, as anyone can guess.Apparently, depts had been mounting up for the last five years.So I called her."we have an opening", I said, "personal protection to an important individual.Six figure pay".She agreed.I met with her in an alleyway.She should've know better than to just trust anyone offering money blindly."your husband is to blame for this", I said to her as I quickly pulled out a desert eagle.But before I could fire, she had pinned, in the blink of an eye.Till that point I was hoping I wouldn't need to pull out that stupid drone.But she has me against a wall, about to call 911.This drone was programmed to come to my location, identify the aggressor, and gun them down with the mini gun attached to it.And I could initiate that program with just a thought, which I did.We are truly in the future.Anyway.So before she could call up the cops, I could hear the drone coming in the distance.Two seconds later, it was finally there.She was dead before she could look up.The drone had fired accurately, and painted the alleyway walls with her guts.Quite an exhilarating experience, if I do say so myself.I finally reached his house.It was being protected by the police.All I needed was a small distraction to make them go away.I had a bag full of hand grenades.So I tossed about a hundred of them their way.The explosions were quite spectacular.Without wasting a moment, I stormed in to what was left of his house.He was lying on the floor, visibly injured.I had studied human anatomy extensively this past week, and knew exactly what to do.I walked up to him and quickly cut across his jugular vein.Blood started spraying in all directions.My body was ready.I stood in front of his body with open arms as his blood covered my entire being.It tasted delicious.This was not only a compensation for my $10, but also a triumph over evil.Unfortunately, this meant that I had to return to my daily routine starting Monday next week.I also had to think about the $86000 hole in my account.That would be quite boring, if I do say so myself.
