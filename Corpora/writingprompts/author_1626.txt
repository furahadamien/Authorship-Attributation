It was always in the back of her mind, maybe this isn't real, maybe I'm really just having a weird dream.Which was stupid, life is weird, but that's normal.Okay 5 minute break over, back into the world, there is a test tomorrow to ace.Maybe I forgot my meds, that must be it, three pills everyday, same hour, stupid me, that's why I'm having these kind of thoughts, the doctor said so, it's just part of being depressed.Meds taken, life continues.The next day she goes to class with a headache and sunglasses, suddenly the sky seemed so bright it was unbearable.Okay so test done, time to go see the crazy people doctor, she walks into his office and suddenly it's okay to take her sunglasses off, there is less light in here, only the same artificial light as her classroom, there's only a small hole in the ceiling, that lets the natural sunlight get in, barely, she could ignore it as long as she didn't stare at that part of the office

" So how was your test?""Okay, kinda of hard, but doable"

"Anything interesting happened this week?""I though about some things..."

"Like what?""This VR goggles my dad gave me when I was 10"

"Really?Any particular reason why?""I don't know, I have weird thoughts sometimes, like what if is not real?What if my life is just a dream?And that's why things work out in the end?And that's why I meet all these cool people?"" Interesting.Weren't you the one who was telling me just last week how boring your life was?""Yeah, but I mean, sometimes"

"Sometimes good things happen, that's the magic of life, no need for a dream, or a what did you say they were again?"" VR Goggles"

Pause

"You're right, I don't know why I think about this stuff, come to think about it I would probably want to be a superhero not a med student if I were in na alternative reality"

"Right?Why choose such a mundane life, makes no sense.So why did you ask for those goggles?Do you remember?""Not really, I think I didn't really ask for them, my dad just wanted me to get away from reality for a bit, it was the summer after my mom left us"

"Well, getting away is always nice, for a time"

"Yeah... so I kinda of have a date after here so.."

" Dont worry we are done here"

"You know something I just realized?There's a crack in your ceiling doc, it keeps getting bigger, you should look into that"

"Oh really, I never noticed, I'll look into that, in the meantime how are you adjusting to your medication?I think we should maybe increase your dosage a little bit, give you more help"

"If you think so"

He writes the prescription and she takes it, still looking at the crack at the ceiling that seemed to let the light shine through so beautifully and somehow seemed larger then when she came in, she remembered something

"Huh, weird"

"What's weird Cat?""I don't remember taking them off, the goggles"

"Well it was 10 years ago, of course you dont" He smiled and handed her the prescription " Don't forget to take your pills, see you next week"
