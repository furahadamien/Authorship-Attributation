Destirigon
I was thirsty, so, as is customary ever since we tricked those mortal fools into making everything easy, I looked for a house with a "welcome" doormat in front of the door.Free snacks after all, and I really wasn't in the mood of chatting up some fool at a bar and going home with them, like we used to do in the shitty old days.....The door wasn't even locked.Not that a lock would have mattered to a vampire anyways, but still.Weird.In retrospect, that should have tipped me off....The hallway was weirdly narrow, barely any room to move around, but thirsty as I was I ignored that weirdness as well and walked straight in, towards my snack.Suddenly, a sprinkler turned on.I let out a cry of anger - what asshole puts a sprinkler in the hallway?!Well, no matter, I'd just make that fucker pay... 

Then, unbearable pain.I looked down.There was a stake in my chest, just barely missing the heart.Lucky me, I wasn't done for yet but damn it was unpleasant even so.I'd have to get out of here, in my current state I wouldn't be able to fight off the human who had built this trap...I tried to turn into mist and get the hell out but it didn't work.*"Don't bother trying.Holy water in that sprinkler, you're nothing special anymore."* A guy with a crossbow had appeared behind me, from a hidden door presumably?!*"So I was right.It's the doormats.That's how you leeches could breed so much lately, why my job is so hard."* 

The man looked pleased.*"Oh well, a trick is only good so long as the victim doesn't realize they're being tricked.Once they do, you just become very predictable.....This little installment is going to clean you out very quickly once we install it into every house everywhere"*

I tried to laugh dismissively.Didn't quite work though, the pain was too much, it came across as pathetic instead."You can't.With this installation, you'd kill every human visitor as well, and since we got rid of castle laws in most of the world you'll just end up in prison."*"Ahahaa no.Look closely: Mirror on the far wall.Laser behind you, and a receptor.When the beam is measured, the pressure plate won't trigger the stakes.But since you guys don't appear in mirrors... "* The asshole laughed loudly now.*"Well, I guess that's Vampires: 0, Humanity: 1.Was fun talking to you but I have a job to do soo....Damn I really need a cool catchphrase.Yippie-Ki-Yay Motherfucker?Cheesy.Whatever."*

He pulled the trigger.This time, he didn't miss the heart.
