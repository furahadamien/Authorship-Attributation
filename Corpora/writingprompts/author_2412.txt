Pride.One of the oft-written about 7 deadly sins.It brings forth images of music icons making sure that everyone who googles them knows how wealthy they are, of world leaders spewing dogma about the greatness of their country ad nauseam, of *many* villains-real and fake- who end up getting killed or captured because they let their ego get to them.Hungras had no such delusions.He knew the power he commanded and he knew just how *fragile* that power was.One slip-up and he was in jail, dead or worse.This is what was on his mind when the latest hero kicked down the door to his lair, springing the trap he had meticulously planned out.The door flew off its hinges, perhaps a bit too easily to those paying enough attention.He knew the hero wouldn't notice though.She fought evil men such as himself with her might and relied on her friends for support in the areas she were lacking in.This is why all his other traps were tailored to kill this hero's allies.Made things easier when he would eventually put one, or in this case likely several, bullets in her head.He didn't turn around, trusting the powerful magnets to subtly alter the path of the crumpled door pieces away from his chair and into the walls.As the dust settled, the hero charged into the room, screaming for blood."***Hungras!***"

"Yes, what is it?Come to yell my ear off about justice or whatever it is you believe in?Well, make it quick; I have a meeting in 10 minutes and I'd rather not be late."That last line was meant to boil the hero's blood further.More anger would mean more mistakes on their end, and an easier kill for Hungras."***You bastard!I'll kill you for what you did!This isn't about the fate of the country or the world anymore!I'm here to pay you back for what you did to me!***"

Hungras yawned.It was a talent he had to develop with much practice.Yawning on command was fairly difficult.The hero hadn't stopped charging down a hallway that whose length she might have questioned had she not been so furious.Again, this was all by design, as the Lightning Turrets needed time to lock onto a target, and *this* hero could move very quickly when she wanted to."You know, I'm surprised that you got as far as you did with allies as *stupid* as yours were."Hungras replied without turning his chair, amplifying his voice so the hero could hear him over their booming steps."You should really be thanking me for ridding you of such a burden."The hero replied with only two words."***Fuck.YOU!***"

"Tsk, tsk, tsk."Hungras taunted."**Language.**"

Hungras only heard screams of range in response.*Well then, its seems as though the bait has been thoroughly set.* He thought to himself as he began to activate the traps that lay below the charging hero.*Now to get on to my meeting.*

Hungras tapped away at his screen, his personal display tracking the hero's every movement and displaying them to him.He was known for being cunning and emotionless strategies and takedowns, but this hero seemed to have forgotten all that upon witnessing her fallen friends.The pressure sensors on the floor displayed the hero coming closer and closer until finally, she passed into the fire zone.The turrets had finished charging and locking on by the time the hero got there so as soon as she crossed into the fire zone, all the turrets loosed their charge into her.Hungras could hear the deafening **BOOM** as the bolts of electricity shot from the hidden turrets, passing through the hero's body and frying all of her cybernetic enhancements.Hungras finally turned his chair around to face the hero who had tried to put a stop to his rule who now stood helpless as several hundred thousand volts of electricity passed through her body at multiple points, paralyzing her.Hungras stood up, drew his pistol with his left hand, and had it aimed it at the hero before he took his first step.He emptied the magazine into the hero, his aim aided by the implants in his eyes and the bio-synthetic muscle fibers in his arm and hand.*BANG.*

*BANG.*

*BANG.*

*BANG.*

*BANG.*

*BANG.*

*BANG.*

*BANG.*

*BANG.*

*BANG.*

*BANG.*

*BANG.*

*BANG.*

*BANG.*

After firing the last shot of the magazine, he re-holstered the pistol while at the same time, his right hand had finished converting to its piercing form and loading the dose of cyanide.Hungras crouched, allowing the bio-synthetic muscle fibers in his legs and arms to tense up for a moment before lunging at the hero, crossing the 15 meter gap between the two in less than a second and with one stride.Hungras glanced down at his arm, embedded to the elbow in the hero's abdomen.With a thought, he released the cyanide stored up in the cybernetic-handblade into the hero's bloodstream.Over the next few seconds, enough cyanide had entered the hero's body to kill several hundred people.Hungras removed his handblade, shook off the hero's blood, straightened his suit and began to walk towards the exit of the room.As he walked, the only sounds in the room were those of his brisk footsteps, the hero dying of 15 gunshot wounds, a large hole in her stomach and the overdosage of cyanide Hungras had just given her and the buzz of the Lightning Turrets that were programmed to not shut off until the hero's brain died and her heart stopped beating.Hungras thought to himself about how he had set up this final encounter.He thought of how he had all the food bugged so that he could monitor every member of the population, resistance or not.He thought of how he had the Enforcers ramp up the brutality of their methods as to provoke an uprising.He thought of how he had spied on the resistance since before its inception.He thought of how he had offered patronage to the most promising members of the resistance.He thought of how he had warned them that a direct raid on his headquarters was a suicide mission, and that he, Hungras the Viper, killed all who opposed them with cunning and ruthlessness such that they never had a chance.He thought of how the heroes never listened to his advice and eventual pleas.He thought of how it all ended here, with a one-on-one that was all but decided years beforehand.Hungras thanked his incredible foresight years ago when he had his tear ducts surgically removed.This was his true power, not speed, strength, intelligence, or some special ability that solved all his problems for him.It was his cunning, and boy had it gotten him far.Somewhere deep down, he wished it hadn't.As he neared the exit, he tapped the transmitter on his collar and spoke to his assistant."Giles, could you please turn on the incinerators *after* I leave the room and let the Anxlari know that I will be on time to our meeting?"He paused for a moment as Giles confirmed his request."Thank you Giles."*Please let the next ones be better than this group.* He thought to himself.*They* ***need*** *to be better than I if they are to have any hope of defeating the Anxlari.Those bastards are even more ruthless than I am, and they would have razed the entire planet years ago had I not been able to trick them into letting me do it.*

Hungras would have cried then, but he was unable.That, and he had a meeting to get to and it would be rude to keep his clients waiting.*Hopefully, one day there will be a hero strong enough to save us all from this.* Hungras thought as he exited the room, hearing the incinerators ignite as the doors closed behind him.
