"This is just like you, Envy," Lust rolled their eyes."Pride gets a whole month to themselves, and you get all bent out of shape, despite you already having the entire season from Thanksgiving to Christmas.""Yeah but I gotta share all that with Greed!"Envy whined."Pride just had this whole entire month to themselves!""Now wait just a-"

"Not just that," Wrath butted in, "You're pushing back in the year!You're encroaching all the way on Halloween's territory for ----'s sake!""Excuse me-"

"Can we talk about that?"Gluttony cut off Pride, and quivered their jowls furiously at Envy and Greed."I am sick and tired of you two butting in to November.That is *my* day!*My* month!You've taken Black Friday and started pushing it into Thursday!"Greed chuckled, "Yep, and that is making a ----ton of money.""You gotta admit," Lust purred, "It's pretty impressive the way you drive the mortals into a frenzy like that.""I AM TALKING, HERE!"Everyone turned to look at Pride.Pride composed themselves, and puffed out their chest."As much as I would *love* to have an entire month dedicated to myself, I can't actually take credit for that."Lust laughed, and looked at Pride through half-drooped eyelids, "Oh, I love it when you delude yourself.""Quiet.If anything, this month is more your department.""Oh please," Lust said, lounging back, "there's a difference between love and lust.""Precisely my point!"Pride grinned, tothe puzzlement of the others."When you take love to the sinful extremes, you get lust.Similarly, there's a difference between Earned Pride and," they gave a knowing grin, "Unearned Pride.""What's the difference?""Glad you asked, Sloth!Earned Pride is what happens when you are Prideful of what you have accomplished.Unearned Pride is when you are Prideful of what you *are*."There was a moment of silence."You know," Lust purred, "you're not helping your case.""Wait-"

Envy pushed in, raising his voice."I told you!Pride's at it again, being all 'high and mighty', 'look at me', 'I am so great,' while the rest of us are just left high and dry, well I've had it!We want months too, and you can sit your pompous ass down and let *us* shine during *our* months!""Now see here...!"Wrath huffed at Greed while the others continued to argue."As much as I *hate* that you're taking up more of the mortals time, at least you're not a lazy ---- like Sloth!"Sloth didn't even dignify that with a response.
