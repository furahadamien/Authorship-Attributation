Across the galaxy, top scientists, political leaders, and philosophers were called to an urgent meeting.With a heavy heart, yet fresh hope, I am pleased to announce our scouts have finally discovered the source of our recent unexplained population decline.An out of the way planet of newly sentient life has recently made great advances in medicine, leading to increased life span and population boom.Their advancements would be celebrated and observed with interest in the hope of peaceful relations were there room for so many in the galaxy, but their success is the doom of our families, our friends, and ultimately, our very lives.As our most brilliant and well respected minds, you have all been summoned to discuss a plan of action for dealing with this threat.Collaboration is encouraged, and no idea is too extreme in these dire times.

The debate raged on for hours.The politicians discussed making contact, establishing peaceful relations, seeing if humans could be persuaded to join the rest of the galaxy in strictly mandated population control.The idea of outright war was floated by some of the bolder (or more fearful) council members.Scientists considered covert chemical sterilization, or causing the humans to turn on themselves to reduce population drastically.They considered introducing poisons into the food supply, and one of them even began developing a concrete plan to piggyback a dangerous disease on the most widely consumed vegetable, Romaine lettuce.Ideas and desperation began to pile up.Our people are DYING, screamed one politician, tilting across the table like an old live oak struck by lightning.And none of you are willing to take the hard steps necessary to ensure our survival! 
We are all willing to take any steps we deem necessary.But we must reach consensus before action, cautioned an older scientist.After what seemed like many standard cycles, as people began to despair and ruin their voices from shouting, one of the youngest philosophers, silent until now, began to speak.It seems to me that there is a great advantage for us in human society that is being overlooked, they said cautiously, adjusting their notes and glasses.Weary heads turned, listless.Like us, many humans are able to find sexual and romantic satisfaction in same sex pair bonds.Some of them are unable to find satisfaction OUTSIDE of these bonds. 
And? The president asked wearily.The main problem, according to my research, is that for some reason humans have been suppressing this natural bonding process for millennia.The reason projected growth for life in the galaxy is off (again, according to my own studies) is that nearly every region on the planet has some sort of legal or societal taboo on this, and as a result of people pretending this is unnatural and attempting to be natural, the population has grown more than it ever should have.Not only is it threatening life in the galaxy, it is also threatening the ecosystem of their own planet. Several council members began to sit up straighter, a glint of hope in their eyes.Do you mean to tell me the solutions been this simple the whole time?
I think so maam, yes.What we need is -
A gay agenda!
The entire room burst from end to end with applause and cheers as every brilliant mind turned to the issue of solving earths crisis of population, using the most powerful force known to the universe: the pure balancing effect of radiant and radical gay love.(Yes I know this is silly beyond belief and I have no clue whats going on with the dialogue and pacing.Im drunk.Fight me!)
