I had gone through 6,629 pages.During the documentation of the first few thousand it didn't matter much.I was somewhat interested, but because no one had a choice it made me uncomfortable to be involved.Years ago the national council announced all persons within their sector must participate.There was uproar for a while- there is still, but we'd all gotten so used to it.Now the idea of living without it sounds dreadful.In short, everyone had access to simplified thoughts of those they interacted with.The NeuroLink kept track of a broken down version of every thought.The processing power is still limited, but wireless connection to Unit is able to categorized brain wave patterns and upload them without an external connector.It was amazing.I didn't quite understand the technology, so it seemed normal at the time.We had them in since childbirth; it was free, it was painless, and it was mandatory.When it was proposed to the public 70 or so years ago there was a violent response from many.Presently I can't imagine anyone reacting so poorly.What it can do for you is fascinating.Imagine having digital access to a file on your life.Everyone person you meet, every thought you have, all simplified and organized into your tablet.You never had to swap contact information.There was no need to guess whether an interaction had gone decent or now.And with the VR extension pack you could relived an animated version of all encounters.I have a couple personal favorites, starting with being an infant and recognizing my mother, acknowledging the love she felt for me.At such a young age my mind was unaware of how extreme her feelings were, being able to experience it again is comforting.Then there's the time I went rafting and ate rice wrapped in banana leaves with an environmental activist group.There's the California road trip we went on in college.There's the man from down south who had built himself a three story tree house with running water and electricity.I'm lucky enough to be able to afford enough storage to recall my family, friends, and the occasional interesting stranger.To get to know what they thought of me and recall the thoughts and feelings I had in the moment is both a wonderful and costly thing.At one point I couldn't pay that months maintenance fee.The day prior I decided to attempt sorting thought and see what could be removed, it was the first time I'd done so and certainly wouldn't be the last.After 28 years of interactions I had 48,539 pages, to readjust with my budget I had to loose 5,132.It's my fault really, I should of starting prioritizing earlier and shouldn't have taken Unit for granted.With basic income everyone was able to afford storage to begin with, but you always need more.No matter how many times the fees increase.It's sort of cruel, knowing we need access and still charging for it.I guess there's the option of opting out, but really how could you?If you couldn't see your own life, someone else may be.Besides, everyone knows an empty NeuroLink is an empty life.So when I needed to cut down it was heartbreaking.The initial reduction algorithm got rid of any person I'd only met once.This meant I could never access their biography again, unless we happened to rencounter one another.This also meant someone I no longer was aware existed could have access to my simplified Unit identification.Deleting was difficult, but necessary.After those people I moved up to less then 3 encounters.When that wasn't enough I tried 4.Then 5.Then 6.Then 7.That was finally what did it.Every night after work for the next month I begun looking though the pages.It helped to pick a date at random.That way you could find those who's conversations were usually only a sentence, and any where emotional connectivity scale was below .42 to weed out the less involved.There were some great moments I had totally forgotten about.Some fun, some funny , one so hilarious I started laughing by only selecting it for an instant.Those were obviously kept.There was sad, disappointment, anger, relief.Some kept some let go.Then there was calm.For me calm was not common.In fact, after exploring more than 6,000 pages during the last few months I had never seen calm.So when that was the associated emotion during an interaction with .68 connectivity I decided to view their section on me.The location is locked, that feature is too expensive, and their geotag isn't on so I'm unsure where this could have been.It was around the time I was working near the ocean.At first that was what i thought the calm was, but I was wrong, very very wrong.They have me saved as a .92 , well beyond anything I've ever encountered.It had to be a mistake.The only time it was that high was with close relatives, friends, or partners.To say it fucked with me would be an understatement.Naturally I pushed forward to view the actual page.It wasn't one page, it was 19.Of the one sentence my Unit has extracted there's had extracted 19 pages worth.Initially it made me sick.I poured myself some water and sat down.This sort of thing NEVER happened, even with the creepiest or stalkers.The idea of the simple text resulting in 19 pages was too much for me to make sense of.What had their unfiltered thoughts been then?I pushed forward and begging reading the fragments.From those I discovered this person was depressed and worked at the farmers market I went to.Still, what made me worthy of a .92?The only thing I had done was smile when walking by and once complimented their t shirt.Edit: added paragraph spacing
