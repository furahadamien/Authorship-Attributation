On occasion, Henry would awake in a cold sweat in the middle of the night.The dreams were always the same; the fear always unchanging.As a young kid, awaking in a bed that was not his; as a young man waking next to his wife; as an old man waking alone.Henry would forever live in fear of the day he would awake without a green line dotted along his bedroom floor."*The red line*",Henry thought "*I could take or leave*."He had only once had the idea to follow it, but it was fleeting and disappeared as quickly as it came.The green line, his trustworthy old friend, had lead him to everything he wanted in life.When Henry was 13 it pushed him directly to the answers of his algebra test, right there on the classroom floor.When he was 17, it directed him towards the girl he would ask eventually ask to prom, and later to marry him.21, it saved him from walking right into a live grenade in Vietnam.At 25, the dotted fluorescent stripe drove him to the bank where he would work for the rest of his life, and then to every promotion and advancement afterword.It was an easy life; a quiet life.'*But what if?*' The voice inside Henry's head asked one morning over tea.Retired, wife dead; everyday had become the same monotonous routine.'*Was there even a point in following the green line anymore?*', he continued asking himself.Henry made the choice to finish his now lukewarm tea and see where the bright stop-sign colored stripe took him that day.At first it wasn't so bad.His first stop was a coffee shop on the east side of town, a place called '*nowhere land coffee.'* "*What an odd name for a coffee shop, but fitting for the day."* Henry thought as he followed his new red friend into the bricked building.'*What can I get you?*' His waitress had a name tag that said 'ALICE' in bold white letters.Henry ordered his coffee to go, not being an avid coffee drinker anyways and eager to see where the rest of the day took him.Henry took a pause as he saw where the next red line ended.It ended...abruptly.In the middle of the street.'*How strange, but that is what this day is about!'* Old man Henry exclaimed, getting into the spirit of the day.A very giddy Henry bounced, or as much as a 70 year man can bounce, into the street and paused.And stood.Waiting for the next thing, ignoring the cars coming, ignoring the taxi hailing to him.The red line was going to save him, just as the green line had been saving him his whole life."*He will wake up soon, but I have to worn you he hit his head very hard, there will likely be complications.*", Henry could overhear his doctor telling someone that he couldn't see.He popped his eyes open to examine which one of his 7 grandchildren had come to this hospital to see him.In a horror filled moment, Henry realized he couldn't get his eyes to open.No, they were open.The cold sweat began the same as always, only this time he would not awake.*And he would never see another green line again.*
