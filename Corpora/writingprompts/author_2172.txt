As Anton's whip tightened around Tony's neck, all the while sending huge volts of electricity through Tony's armor, he saw a familiar figure walk towards him."Ms. Carter, please step away!!!".Peggy stopped for a second, and then continued walking towards Anton."Stop!You know his father stole my dad's inventions.He will pay for his father's sins."Peggy stood face to face with Anton.Well, technically, her chest was facing his stomach.She didn't hate her old age, but was definitely not too happy about how much effort it took for her to stand up straight.She took a deep breath and straightened her back.Now they were chest to face.Peggy summoned some more strength and lifted her neck and looked into Anton's eyes."Now, Anton, do not pretend that your father was righteous and innocent.I think we both know the things he did."His eyes dropped, he looked sideways, unable to make eye contact, "He was no angel, but his father," looking at Tony writhing at the other end of his whip, "reaped the benefits of my father's hard work, and build such a huge business empire.His father," he lowered his voice as he increased the voltage that hit the armor, "sent my father back to Russia, where he spent the rest of his life in a Gulag.""Anton, is that what your father told you?"Anton's eyes met hers, searching for answers.She continued...

"I was in SHIELD.You want to know what happened?Your father was kidnapped by HYDRA, and then some of the major publications released news stories of him being deported.""He was a brilliant scientist.You think that if he had been deported, he would've been kept in a Gulag?"She laughed a little."You think Russians would waste a great mind such as your father's in a Gulag".She said Gulag in a typical Russian accent and really elongated the aa sound to make her point."What do you think the SHIELD did with Arnim Zola?Do you think we threw him in a prison?No, we put him to work, and he worked for us until the day he died.""He was old, senile, and brainwashed, by the time they let him go, probably he was of no use to them anymore.""Come on Anton, Tony's not your enemy.Let him go, and hold me hostage so that he doesn't hurt you.""I am not taking you hostage, Peggy.""But you're letting him go.""I am not sure"

"Yes you are"

"Peggy, how do I know you're telling me the truth?""Anton, I might be lying to you, but you agree that there is room for doubt in your theory.Right?Then I will go and talk to Tony" 

"It's going to take you the whole year to reach him, by then his backup will be here.""You really want to insult me right now?""Teasing, Ms. Carter, teasing, not insulting...I am sorry..."

Peggy turned around and thought to herself.Well it's going to be a long walk.As she neared Tony, she was grateful that this time she won't have to straighten up, the man was already on his knees."How you doing Tony?""Listen Peggy, I don't need your help, my armor is protecting me like a faraday cage, thanks to the failsafes I created to save myself from lightning strikes.""Tony, who is the man you are fighting?""Peggy, please don't think of this as a teachable moment, I am working over here.I really don't need any 'know your enemy' lessons right now"

"What happened Tony, systems are offline, can't run a facial recognition?""His whip's fried all armor connectivity below my helmet, my network sensors are on my back, and they are offline.""So you can't even call for backup?"Tony's voice was very low, as he very sheepishly said, "No"

"And... you don't need my help?Okay, why am I not dead right now?""Peggy, stop asking me questions, I am busy", Tony said, annoyed, when it suddenly dawned on him, "Why aren't you dead, Peggy?Because you know him!!!??How?Why is someone you know attacking me?What's going on Peggy?""Because his father was a friend..." she paused, waiting for his helmet to turn towards her " of your father and me"

"Then why the hell is he attacking me, how the hell does he have my ARC reactor?Oh because his father invented it.He is Vanko's son.""Finally, you learnt something, do you promise not to attack him?""He killed so many people here today, how can I let him go?""I am trying to save your behind, young man!!!At least have some common sense.""Peggy, I can't let him go..."

"Tony, as things stand, I really don't think you're in a position of holding him.I am going to go and make him go away.Catch him next time...Although I'll recommend that you try helping him.""Why will I help him?"Peggy just shrugged, and went back to Anton, "what do you want to do?""I don't know, I killed so many people here today"

"Anton, that's what you did, what do you want to do now?""Peggy, they will arrest me..."

"Yes Anton, but they will not deport you, you built an ARC reactor yourself, in a garage in Russia.What do you think will happen next?You will go to prison, but you will work on stuff you always dreamed of.""What about him?""His suit is offline from the neck down"

Anton turned off his whip, and Tony collapsed to the ground.Cops surrounded him,  "Stupid old bitch, always thinks she can talk these guys out of things and get them to surrender."said one

Antone turned on his whips again, and took the cop by the scruff and said, "Did you just call Ms. Carter a bad word?You're lucky I don't feel like killing more people today, better apologise to her afterwards."
