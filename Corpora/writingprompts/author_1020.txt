I am an old man and I live in a corpse of a world.It's hard to remember much of the world's life, I have a vague mushy but generally inviting soup of memories, the concepts of streets, smiles, and sunlight drifting around in it like the processed frozen chicken and letter-shaped pasta you can find in a typical can of soup at a supermarket.Or more rather, would have found if it hadn't been looted decades ago.I've missed hot soup more than anything in the past years.The smoke and ash have smothered the sun with a bleak, oppressive wall after the bombs, so it's cold.Very cold.But thankfully for me, that seems to be the extent of my worries as I usually have something to eat.One of the few things I recall about my life before the bombs were winning a contest.No clue what it was, I think it involved counting something, but the prize, well the price I couldn't forget even if I wanted too.Oreos.A lifetime supply of little cookies.The Ad said I'd get the cookies once a month for some reason I got them once a week.They were usually gone before their replacements came in though.Eventually, I got sick of the damn things, started selling at school or at work when I grew up.Then I let my kids have them.Then the bombs dropped.Then I didn't have kids anymore.Then they kept coming.I would like to tell you how shocked I was on my first post world shipment or explain the seemingly magical means they appear in my sack every Friday at 9:00 AM, but I can't really be bothered to question my blessing.The world after the bombs is more of a bleak depressing purgatory than the hellish TV renditions I can sometimes coax out of my memory soup.Very few people survived.I can probably count the number of people I've seen since the world drowned in fire with the fingers on both of my hands, and I'm missing a few.But there's one group I remember.The one that made me realize these little snacks were a blessing.It was 3 families, A mom and two children, A couple and their Newborn, and finally a couple of children who looked nothing like either of the sets of parents so my guess is their's didn't make it and they were brought in with the group at one point.I couldn't tell you for sure.I never spoke to them.I simply humored my inner voyeurist and observed them in their journeys for nearly a week.They were struggling.The cold had softened them up, but the real thing literally eating away at them was the hunger.I saw them, they were skinny and frail and covering less ground day by day but one night, a very cold snowy night mind you, as I was watching them from a hill above their camp they did something that struck a chord with me.They broke into song.In the face of death, they sang happy songs about winter, bells, lights, and cheer.Their words danced through my ears and into my brain, teasing out memories of prewar times with my own family, and in doing so changed something within me.I had smiled for the first time in nearly a decade since the bombs dropped.A few hours later they were all asleep in a few different ruined houses and I knew what I was going to do.I slipped on my trusty red winter jacket and hat, grabbed my sack full of Oreo packs I had saved over the years and left my camp towards theirs.I wormed my way through the nuclear winter, and while my portly body acted as a nice source of warmth, it wasn't enough to stop my cheeks from turning bright or my long white beard to get caked in the frozen offal of the sky.After a near half hour of decent, I made it to the camp.I snuck into each house one by one and left packs of Oreos by the foot of everyone's beds.Every man and woman got a pack of Oreos.Sadly the children didn't get a pack of Oreos.They got nearly 20.Each.After I closed the final door, or what's left of it(quietly of course) I made my way about 20 paces from the camp.I looked back for a moment, smiled yet again and mosied on my merry way, humming the tune of what I now remembered as "Jingle Bells", each hard crunch in the tainted snow taking me away from the first sign of life I had seen in years.If there are people out there, somewhere they deserve to blessed as I have been.The spirit of giving is now never-ending.
