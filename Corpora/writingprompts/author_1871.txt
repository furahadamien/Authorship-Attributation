"The trick was waiting" The old man weezed as he spoke.He tilted back and forth on the rocking chair as he stared into nothing.His pale blue eyes, one blinded by something many years ago, had a whitened iris.Both stood in stark contrast to the orange of his jumpsuit."Math is a cruel mistress.." Spitting at the stone wall, the spittle smacked against it and dribbled down into a crack."How could they alter the math?When the odds are always in our favour?"I blurted my question.i couldnt wait for his meandering way of speaking to come to the point.Not only had i been seperated from my family, the girl i loved and shipped out to an island in the middle of the ocean.But now my luck had disappeared.It was like i had been on cruise control my whole life.Everything took effort now!My first night on the island was hell on earth.My bowels had always simply emptied themselves when i sat on toilets, i always got it all on the first wipe.I could eat whatever i wanted without gas or indigestion or my newest concern, weight gain.I had to actually brush my teeth now, instead of a simple gargle with mouth wash.Walking was a whole new concept, i recently learned what falling up stairs was like and tripping over nothing.I cant eat properly without nearly chipping my teeth on metal spoons and forks..I even think my penis has shrunk.I was in no mood for his excruciatingly slow rate of speech."What the Fuck is happening!!?"He paused only a moment, taking in the situation and my exasperation.Locking his ghostly eyes with mine..

"The mind masters all it attempts, the balance becomes altered, it no longer works as it did.We are in the dead zone on this planet.The magnetic field is weakest here.They call it the Bermuda Triangle."I sat back stunned.There was so much to unpack from that.The dead zone?The goddamned Bermuda Triangle!?What does the magnetic feild have to do with it?Why did he bring up math first?So many more questions and no fucking answers..

"The Maths work differently here."He mumbled quietly..

We sat there without speaking a long while, in our stone walled cell.The creeking of the rocking chair the only noise.The sun had begun to set, coating the wall opposite the window in reds and yellows framed inside the shadow of the rusted iron bars.Finally he broke the silence "When you and i were born our luck was tied to the magnetic feild.It becomes stronger as we age as we build our own magnetic charge internally.""What?"I half laughed "that sounds like complete and utter horse shit."He squinted and turned to look at me "i suppose it does, doesnt it?"We broke into laughter, a sweet joy filled moment breaking the pressure of sorts.It was as if i suddenly lost something inside me i hadnt noticed until it was gone.Begrudgingly, oddly enough, i summed up what he had told me so far."So magnetically charged people are lucky, so they ship us over to the dead zone where we cant cause trouble?""Mmm" was his response.He meant it as agreement, i was sure."On the island, in the dead zone our one hundred out of one hundred luck rating, goes down to one hundred out of infinity.Math is a cruel mistress."He smiled for some reason.I perked my right eyebrow in question."What?Why are you smiling if we are stuck here?""Remember how i told you we build our own charge as we age?"He stopped rocking, then placing his hands on his knees, leaned forward still smiling."Yeeees?"I said in more baffled confusion than answer.He heaved himself upward out of his chair, standing he placed the back of his hand at the small of his back, wincing as he did so.He straightened to his full height slowly then turned to meet my confused gaze."Today is my 112th birthday."his smile returned even stronger as he reached up to touch the rusted iron bars of the cell window.He pushed ever so slightly and the rusted iron barred window fell outwards onto the ground exposing the star filled night view completely unobscured."112 years, so im going to need a boost?"Edit: id love some feedback, positive or negative
