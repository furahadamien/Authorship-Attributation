'You must not smoke!'- why do I think I should?Is not tobaccic abstinence for the common good?Is this not widely proven, by studies deep and loud?Were I to renounce nicotine, should I not then be proud?And yet, deep within me, my heart starts to rebel
I care not for the health risks, or that sweet-sour smell
I care not for the harm that's said awaits each little child
Who breathes in my tobacco smoke, as I walk, cursed, reviled

This is a simple matter, one red in tooth and claw
Of course I want longevity; but I want freedom more.Your duty is to teach me?So, you have taught me; fine
But you do not command me: the choice in this is mine.You care not for the common good, nor what is good for me
You care about your power - that is quite plain to see
You care about society according to your plan
But you do not command me: for I am a free man.
