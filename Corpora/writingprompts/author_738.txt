"Barks, Scruff, Danny" Nips said hello, sniffed butts and settled on the grass.The Williams kid would be starting his paper route soon.They'd chase him for a block or two, make him pedal off some of that winter weight, then they'd come back to stretch and let their bellies warm in the sun."Hey Nips" Barks asked "where'd you get that scar?""Oh this?"Nips flopped his ear back, showing the long gash to everyone."Well Barks, I got this one before you were even born".Danny looked down and scratched his ear."See" Nips began "this came from a time me and Danny was out on the town down near the tracks back in '11."Nips licked his lips.The gang was rapt."It was December, close to Christmas.That time of year when kids are running everywhere, all jacked up on the hope of new toys and a puppy under the tree.Danny told me about a couple of ladies that he'd seen from the truck window so we decided to take a walk.You know how the days get dark early then, so we set out early.We made it down to the tracks pretty quick, it was cold so you had to keep moving.I could smell the marks of a hundred dogs so I didn't hold out much hope for the ladies still be, shall I say, available?Anyway we looked around a bit, chased a cat or two, and were just about to head home when this kid runs out in the middle of the street crying.He's got this pup in his arms, the pup is trying to lick his face, you know, cheer him up, but the kid ain't stoppin.So Danny goes over, flops down and tries to get the kid to rub his belly.Now, boys, I seen a lot of roll overs in my day and Danny's are among the best.But that kid didn't see Danny for nothin.And then I see why.Out of the door burst this big guy, maybe five dogs high.And he's red.Not just his face.His hands, his chest and if I coulda saw his feet I'da bet they was red too.He starts yelling about that cute little puppy who, as near as I could tell, had eaten the big guys steak.And the big guy says there's going to be hell to pay.And the big guy knocks the kid and grabs that puppy and draws his arm back like he's going to send that cute little thing to the moon.Well, Danny wasn't having any of that and neither was I.So Danny goes for the guys pant leg to trip him up a bit.And if Danny had been a little quicker he would have seen the guys other leg swinging round to clock him in the ribs..sent Danny halfway cross the road.Which only made me madder.So I leaped.I'd like to think it well reasoned but that leap was pure emotion.I landed squarely in his chest and sunk my teeth into the very arm that held that wee dog.Not enough to break the skin, but enough to make him let go.What I didn't count on was once he let go of the pup he had two hands for me.He grabbed me and tossed me right into a street sign.Cut me pretty bad but not very deep.Looked worse than it was.""What about the pup?Was the pup ok?"Scruffs asked with a tear in his eye."The pup?Ya, sure.Danny and me checked up on him over the years.Turned into a great big Shepard.Looked like the big guy went away and the kid seemed ok too.They had that bond, eh boys?Nothin like it"

"Nothing like it" they all agreed.They'd all had it once, when they had boys of their own.And then the Williams kid rode by and they were young again.
