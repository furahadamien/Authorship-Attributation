The silk curtains fluttered in the cold November winds, brushing ever so softly on Evelyn's shoulder.With its cool touch, Evelyn slept soundly.A distant owl cooed, the falling leaves danced in the night.As the darkness grew dense and empty, the moon burned bright in the sky.Not a single cloud in the sky, the beige red moon hung high bursting through the black sea.While Evelyn slept, her phone began to buzz, shining bright in her dark room.Vibrating against her nightstand, her phone buzzed and shone, soon the owl had ceased cooing.Evelyn turned over frustrated, freeing herself from her blanket cocoon.The cold air washed over her milky white skin sending goosebumps along her arms and back.Fumbling for her phone in the darkness, she grasped it tight and brought it with her under the cover of her blankets.Warm and cozy, Evelyn wiped the sleep from her eyes, letting out an enormous yawn.The phone began vibrating again, another post, then another, an another.Soon new posts were flooding her home screen.Instagram, facebook, and snapchat, all tagging Evelyn, messaging her.Atop all the social media posts, Evelyn noticed the SMS message from her girlfriend Samantha.In all caps, with no context read a message, "DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON".Evelyn laid there confused, her mind still fuzzy from sleep.She peered her head out from the covers, he alarm clock in the corner of the room read 3:12AM, she had school in only a few hours.Retreating back under her covers, she sat there confused and angry.Racing thoughts began filling her head, all the other messages were saying how beatiful the full moon looked tonight, how big and bright it was.Yet, through all the messages, Samantha was the only one to tell her not to look.And in all caps, the scared Evelyn, why would Samantha say that.It began to worry her as her phone continued receiving dozens of messages at once.With an eerie sense of being overwhelmed, Evelyn dropped her phone off her bed, landing flat down on her carpet.Breathing a sigh of relief, Evelyn tried resting her eyes and drift back to sleep.While she tried sleeping, a nagging suspicion began building in her stomach.She couldn't shake the weirdness she felt with the messages.Why was everyone messaging her about the moon?why did Samantha say not to look?.While the thoughts continued to race, Evelyn peered out from her covers looking towards the window.Through the darkness was a dull light, a light high in the sky that could only be coming from one place.While the nagging feeling in her gut, Evelyn swallowed her fears and buried herself under the covers.Something didn't seem right, she wouldn't look.While her mind continued to wander, feint footsteps began creeping up the stairs.Living in an old house had it issues, one of them being creaky floor boards.Evelyn figured it was her mother going to bed for the night, she always stayed up late watching nature documentaries.Unable to sleep, Evelyn once again emerged from her cocoon of blankets and looked towards the door.The hall light switched on, illuminating under door.Who ever it was stood beyond her door.As the door knob turned ever so slightly, Evelyn contemplated being asleep, she felt hot and nervous.With a thin push, the door swung open.Blocking the hall light like an eclipse, her mother stood motionless.Evelyn laid with her blankets pulled up towards her nose.She called out to her mother, asking if she was alright.Unable to see her face through the darkness, her mothers head twisted sharply to the right.Evelyn's stomach dropped, the room seemed to go completely silent.Her neck made a nauseating cracking sound, Evelyn cried out in disgust.Still, her mother said nothing, she took a faint step forward.Tears were bubbling in Evelyn' eyes as her mother walked towards the bed with her head at a right angle.She stood over her, looking at her sideways.Her mouth groaned open, letting out a foul smell that took Evelyn back.Her mother let out in a raspy, sinister voice to get up.Evelyn rose slowly, without saying anything her mother pointed towards the window.The window where a dull light was burning bright in the sky.Evelyn chocked and sniffled, her mother disfigured and cold stood pointing.Peering through the window, Evelyn noticed her calm neighborhood, a place she was quiet fond of.And through the darkness, shapes began to form.Soon she was able to recognize groups of people huddled around one another, staring up at the sky.The only thing visible in the sky tonight was the large full moon.With its blotchy dark spots and cool whites of orange, Evelyn took it in sharply.Her eyes burned, her skin went cold.As the consciousness left her body, Evelyn dropped limp to the floor with a crash.Her mother, grabbed her and dragged her outside.Awaking later which felt like an entirety for her, she was transfixed upon the moon.Her eyes peeled wide, her mouth agape.She couldn't stop staring.As the moon burned brightly, the orange hues began pulsating, growing larger.As the crowd of wide eyed, gaped mouth onlookers watched in awe, an arching beam of light shot out from the moon.The crowd reacted with shock and awe.A meteor began burning bright, heading down towards earth.The flaming objected reflected brightly in the onlookers eyes and the cold night swept on.Unable to move or think, they continued to stare.The goosebumps grew larger on Evelyns arms, her lips blue, teeth chattering.Through her fog, a voice pierced through her and everyone in the crowd.Samatha cried out for Evelyn down the block.Like a switch, the crows diverted their attention to Samantha.She stood under a lone street lamp.The crowds heads began turning to the right, an orchestra of cracking, Evelyns neck snapped easily.As Samantha cried out in horror.The meteor crashed in a field yards away, the night lighting up in a fiery orange explosion.The crowd didn't flinch, Samantha turned to run as a thunderous animal roar bellowed from within the crash.The crowd dropped limp to the ground.Evelyn' blank stare fixed on Samantha darting back into the darkness as the ground had a violent tremor as the being grew closer.
