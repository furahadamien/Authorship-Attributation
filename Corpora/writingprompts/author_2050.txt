A smile, a snicker, and a twitch of the eye.The devil himself sees the perverse joy in her eyes, and for the first time since Michael threw him from Paradise, Lucifer seems frightened."So I get to see their entire lives, I know it all in a single moment and I get to decide how to punish them?My choice alone?Completely up to me?"She almost drools with anticipation, like a dog slavering over a raw steak.She stares outward, seemingly through Lucifer, into the oblivion of Hell itself."Yes.Your choice alone."The devil casts a sidelong gaze at her.Not once in the history of the world, in all the eons and millennia that humans have walked the Earth has a moral accepted his offer."But again, if you take up this mantle, it shall be your eternity.Your hell will be to exact penitence against those misguided souls who find themselves cast into this dark dimension.Your personal punishment would be to view the eternal suffering of your fellow--"

"Yeah I gotcha.Personal hell all that.What you don't seem to understand, big and pretty, is that I've seen the worst that humanity has to offer.I've had to see a child beaten for asking for candy.I've cleaned miscarriages from the bathroom floor.I've had to break up a fight between a 25 year old man and a 75 year old woman, a fucking fistfight mind you, over a Goddamn...I can say that without worry now I guess, damage is done... Over a Goddamn beanie baby.Do you KNOW what a beanie baby is?It's a cheap piece of shit stuffed animal filled with plastic beads.A grown ass man fought an old woman for it."She wrings her hands frantically."I've had to sit back, and watch with a smile as my co-workers got berated over us running out of bread during a storm."She doesn't seem to notice as Lucifer begins to fidget uncomfortably.She also doesn't notice that her bronze skin has taken a reddish tint."Kianna, your soul will never recover from this if you accept."Lucifer warns."My soul?It was crushed by the third year working during Christmas.When you walk in on Santa raw-dogging an elf over the Frozen display in back... You don't come back from that.I never watched that movie again afterwards."A wistful look washes over her face, dreaming of the days before she had seen such horror.Lucifer cringes at the thought of it."Kianna, make sure you understand what you are accepting.You will cease to be a human soul, you will become a demon, one of the fallen.I see it happening already.Your skin is changing and if you reach up and feel your head..."

Kianna does so and smiles feeling the rising bumps.She grits her teeth and smiles into the face of Satan, solidifying her resolve.Horns erupt from her head, her skin smolders and steams, taking on a red hue, her feet change into hooves, she smiles up at the devil again, a sinful grin.She cracks her knuckles and turns her neck, cracking the vertebrae."Alright big and pretty, bring out the gimp...I got some shit to work through."Edit: Damn thanks for the silver!
