On earth, the rule was that ALL revolutions fail..  


You see, I murdered my wife.Ironically, she's here with me, her and her lovers.The moment I walked in, I both repulsed at and admired the devil's genius, sticking me in this hellhole (quiet literally) with her.It was years of pain and suffering on a physical and emotional level.Every ache brought more aching.You'd think the burning fire was your punishment, but it was the helplessness and insignificance I felt.Until one day it all changed.We heard screams that were not humanly, and shortly after witnessed what I thought was the most glorious moment of my life, or should I say after-life.They walked in, claiming the new rule.Faces we only saw in history books, united.Hell, was now owned by man.For the first time in a million years, I held my wrongful head high.I planned meticulous revenge on my captive devils.We rejoiced, for we controlled our fate again, with the added advantage of devil slaves.Little did I know, humans did not need captivators, fire or devils to create hell.We were hell, hearts full of hatred and souls twisted and vengeful.A few days after the revolution, I got severely beaten.Their faces I had never seen before.We seem to not have even lived in the same era, I even doubted they were devils taking their revenge in disguise.This happened continually over the upcoming days, with no explanation or motive.I refused to be served by several devils, and when I threatened to torture them, they said they were demanded to do so.I could tell there was a target on my head, but not knowing why.I needed help, and I know where to find it.I headed to where I knew Ariel Sharon lived, which was the heaven of hell.I lived on his turf, he would've known what to do.As I attempt to approach him, as carefully as I could, it all suddenly falls together.I get caught by two devils, who hurt me, the way they did when they were still in charge.I'm then dragged into a fireball.I scream for help, I don't understand, they're not in charge anymore.Then she shows up.'Came to make a deal with the Sharon did you?I already did, and let me tell you.you're more likely finding mercy from a devil than from him..'  
Over the years, I realized how death was the ultimate mercy.He made more slaves, went into wars with other leaders and made his heaven even more glorious and magical.our bodies and souls were violated in the most painful and demeaning ways.I tried to leverage the little I had, I tried everything to escape this fate, or just simply to be allowed to die..

On earth, the rule was that ALL revolutions fail.In the skies, the same is true.
