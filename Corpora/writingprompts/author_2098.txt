"The voice.You know that voice in your head.The one that's your inner voice?Most people it's their own voice, they can hear it, speak it, even imagine the words coming out of your mouth.Some people, even think of it as someone else, like Morgan Freeman or something just to play around and have fun I guess.Most people can control their thoughts and inner voice.Not me.My inner voice is her.I can't control it, I can't stop it.Frankly, right now, shes speaking to me.""And what is she saying Ryan?"The psychiatrist asked, leaning back in her arm chair.Lethar squeaking, chewing on the back of her pen with a concentrated look on her face, perplexed as to where I was going with this."She's telling me I'm not crazy.Not schizophrenic like you say.That I'm okay.I'm normal."I replied, while palming my eyes and rubbing them in frustration.At this point I'm unsure that why, for 37 years... as long as I can remember her inner voice was combating mine.Mentally I'd get into arguments with her, try and ignore her.No matter what I do she knows what I'm doing, saying, even thinking.All the time."To call your self crazy isn't right, maybe it's your thoughts rationalizing your feelings about your schizophrenia.Maybe you are.... trying to come to terms."She leaned forward to address me."Yeah.... maybe, maybe I am crazy."I was doubting my self, I knew what I told Dr. Skinner was bullshit.I knew it, she knew it, but the court mandated these.... mediations.I call them that because even though on paper its "helping" it's just wasting my fucking time.Just get it over with I say.One day it will be over.25 years later since my episode, I'm still fucking here.Still talking about the same shit.Except shes helping me get through it, but I could never tell Dr. Skinner that.They would lock me away, her and I both knew that, and I had a lawfirm to run.Oddly enough successful people can too have problems of their own.Then again, what's it worth when you talk to nothing but your imagination."Your doubting your self again Ryan.I think your making progress, more and more each day."She stated while beginning to type what she has written in her notes."I think that's a good place to end until next week.Don't you?""Yeah, thanks Dr.Skinner."I gathered my things and headed out.I knew what she was telling me wasn't what she was actually writing.Oliva knew that as well.That's her name, Olivia.She told me when we were kids.Like she grew up with me.I walked out on the the busy street.I had to make it back to the lawfirm downtown before lunch was over.I had a meeting with a client who was pressing charges against her company for "unsafe working conditions" in reality, I knew it was bullshit, but I had to entertain the bullshit if we wanted to make money."I can take the south express line, should spit me out a block from the lawfirm."I thought to my self."Theres a delay Ryan, you'll be late."Olivia interjected into my conciousness."If you take a cab you'll get there early.Trust me.""Yeah yeah."I spoke out loud, but quietly as to not draw attention.The fact that my thoughts weren't my own, the lines get blurred with what you say and what you think sometimes.It's hard to keep track."Why don't you trust me Ryan?"Oliva asked, sounding upset."Because, your not real."I mumbled but put head phones in.It was a good way for people to, not look.Now a days they just think your on the phone anyway and ignore it.Everyone's face is in the thing anyway, surprised they even know where they are going."Like that!You wont say my name, it's been years since you've said my name."She whined."Again, your not real and I'm just having a fucking conversation to my self, and I'm still entertaining it by talkign to you."I said as I decended into the subway station.The previous subway car doors shut and I was left relatively alone on the platform, headphones still in."What is it going to take to convince you I am."Olivia began to bargain.Funny, shes never said anything like this before.So I decided to play into it, maybe I can.... break my self?I don't know.Maybe stop it from happening."And no Ryan, your not going to get rid of me by 'playing into it' again."She said before I could finish my thought."One, stop doing that, and two, physical evidence would work.Again, your not real!"The subway car rumbled up to the station and I entered.I was alone, standing there.The car smelled like must and urine and just.... city smell.I hated it."Well if we meet, we can finally move to the country like you've always wanted.I know you hate this smell.So do I."Olive said."Yeah, sure.Let's make it happen then."I said to Olivia sarcastically."You don't have to be so sarcastic about it."Oliva said with a brashness that I could tell she was upset with me.The car began to fill up at the next stop.I wasn't alone anymore.People were around, to many people, and would know I'm talking to my self so I decided to use my inner voice."Well I'm crazy Olivia, I can't even take meds anymore because.... because it doesn't work."I was frustrated.I gripped the steal bar tighter."Ryan, please stop.I'll prove your not."She pleaded.*Ding* [Next stop, 14th and Albany] 

My stop.The car still barrelling through the subway line, lights flickering and the car shaking and creaking.My hand gripped the steel rail harder.I'm getting angry, not with her, or anything, with my self.All this time I've played into it, what's one more game I guess."Ryan, please.Listen to me."Olivia pleaded again, but I ignored her.The car came to a halt and I basically ran out of there and up the subway station steps towards the street."Ryan!"She got louder as I approached the street.I always thought I could outrun my own thoughts.Ever since I was a kid, but I knew it not to be true."Ryan, watch out!!"Olivia shouted and for some reason I stopped just before I stepped into the street.A bus flew by, nearly could have killed me or put me in the hospital."Oh fuck!!"I exclaimed, hands on my knees breathing hard and heavy."Hey buddy you okay?You almost got flattened!"A stranger asked me who was next to me at the cross walk."Yeah, yeah.I'm fine."I replied."Thanks.""Well sure but thank that lady who yelled to you."He stated.My heart sank."What did you say?"I looked him dead in the eyes.I thought I only heard that."Turn around Ryan.Please."Oliva said inside my head, and this time out loud.It was her, long brown hair, blue eyes, exactly how she was in my dreams as a kid."Hi Ryan, it's good to finally meet you."Olivia smiled a beautiful smile that made me smirk."Hey buddy, you.... you uh... see her....right?"I asked the stranger next to me."Of course, she looks beautiful, hard not to notice."He chuckled."Oh excuse me."He said to a woman he bumped into as we walked across the street and she replied to him.I knew he was real too."Yes Ryan, hes real, I'm real.... your not imagining any of this and your not crazy, and I know your thinking 'did I get hit by the bus and now I'm dreaming this or dead?'But you didn't and this is real."Oliva knew what I was thinking still because that's EXACTLY what I was thinking."You're.... you're real!!"I exclaimed as we both lurched forward and held and kissed each other."Don't cry Ryan, I'm hear now.I'm not going anywhere, never.I love you, I always have and I never lied about that.Not once!"Olivia comforted me and pressed her head against my chest.I'm not crazy.It's real.She's real.The woman of my literal dreams is real.I don't know if I manifested her.I don't know where she came from.She has a family.Shes been alive and has a life.I don't know if we were two souls who were connected in a past life.If that's something you believe in, or we were always destined to be together.We don't know.Probably never will.I know she's perfect.Everything I've ever wanted.Like she fell from the heavens.This is the happiest I've been in the 37 years on this floating rock in the vast nothingness that is our existence.Now I know....I'm not crazy.She's real.We are real.I'm not crazy.....I'm not crazy....
