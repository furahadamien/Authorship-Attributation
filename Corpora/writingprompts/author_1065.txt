I've been following this red, almost scary, path for, what, an hour now ?It's lead me to a place I've never seen before, despite being actually close to my home.It's an abandoned-looking mansion, with broken windows and all the common horror-movie features.Nevermind, I don't care, I need to know what's at the end.The line continues behind the wooden doors, up the stairs of a rather creepy-looking stone tower.Quite long stairs, if you'd ask me.The longest I've ever climbed.Am I even in the mansion anymore ?My sense are telling me that I should've encountered a roof or something, at least another floor.But no, I keep going up the stairs.In the end, after almost anothet hour, I reach something.Thanks God I spent some of my green-line-earned money on sport machines, or I would've been dead by now.Well, where am I ?There's nothing, nothing but a single door, a single table, a single chair, and... someone.He hasn't noticed me yet, but does when I approach."Ah, welcome, mister... mister what ?-Mister Heden, I say, trying not to look too tired.Where am I ?-Well, that's unusual.Normally, people know when they're dead."My blood turns cold."Wait, I'm dead ?-Well, you very look like.But don't worry, you're at the right place !Just let me see your ticket, please.-Man, I don't know what you're talking about.First, I can't be dead, and second, I have no ticket  and have never heard of it."The man glances at me with both pity and amusement in his eyes."Well then, Mister, I invite you to go back and follow the green line.The red line if only for the person who already have their ticket.Actually, we could say it's for the VIP, as the people on the green line may take some time to reach Heaven.But, hey, at least you'll reach it."------

I honestly don't know tf I did with this prompt.Please ignore.
