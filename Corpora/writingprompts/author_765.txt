"That has got to be, without a shadow of a doubt, the dumbest fucking thing I have ever heard."Sergeant Barnes stood waiting for the coffee machine to finish making noise.Beside him stood Police Constable Williams, with a report in-hand."But it has to be the case, sir.There's no other possible connection.""No other connection *that you can find*.""Sir, how many victims have there been so far?Seventeen?Eighteen?""At least twenty," Barnes replied, as he checked his coat pockets for cigarettes."Bloodwork suggests there's more than we originally thought.What's your point?""My point is that there's no other correlation between them.Do you not think it's odd that there are never any signs of forced entry, given the condition of the bodies?""I don't think the killer is choosing his victims because they have a fucking welcome mat.""To be honest, I'm not too sure of that either.But we're obviously dealing with a complete nutter, so I think it might be worth considering.Maybe he really hates welcome mats."Barnes let out a short groan."Fine, I'll read it.*If* you go around the corner and get me some cigs.I've run out."Williams glanced at the clock above the door (8:37am), then promptly obliged.With the report and morning coffee in-hand, Barnes walked over to his desk.He waited until he could see Williams in the street through the nearby window, then chuckled as he dropped the report into the bin.The welcome mat killer.He had now officially heard it all.Williams was a promising young officer, but he could be a real idiot sometimes.
