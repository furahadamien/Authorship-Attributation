When I was very young, I had absolutely no idea what my father's career was.Mother stayed at home and took care of us, so my brother and sisters took to her more than my father, who disappeared from the house pretty often.You might see stuff on TV about kids asking their parents what they're doing when they go away for 8+ hours a day, or ask them about this enigmatic thing called 'work', that is somehow both a location and an activity.We were no exception to this standard.But what may have been exceptional about my dad, is that whenever I asked about his profession it was always a different answer.Sometimes the answers made sense, like when he said he was a 'contractor' and he did odd jobs for the government.Other times they made less sense, like when he said he was going out to 'help someone finish their autobiography'.One day he might work for a couple of hours and spend the rest of it at home; another day he might leave before sunrise and not come back until midnight.Other times he'd leave on week long business trips.It all confused me and I asked him more than a few times to see if I could get a clearer understanding.Well, Dad must have either caught on to my confusion or realized he wasn't satisfying my curiosity, because one of his replies went something like, "Son, I know that you just want to make sure that I'm not sneaking off and having fun without you, but my job is... complicated.I think you're smart enough to understand that sometimes I have to stretch the truth about what I do in order to keep things smooth here at home.My job involves some funny peoplepeople who aren't always right in the head.You know what; get me that pad of paper and a pen off the counter over there."I obligingly strode over and retrieved the items, handing them to him upon returning."I know that you don't like it when I go out for a long time and disappear from the house.So I'm going to write you a list of codewords for us to communicate in, so you know when I'm gone, how serious the job is, and how long until I get back.Now, I might have some tough days at the office and won't come back on time, but I promise that I will always come back."Dad and I spent the rest of the morning coming up with code phrases and passwords.For some reason he never carried a key and mom always had to let him in after checking to see who just rang the doorbell in a 2-1-3 pattern.We always knew it was him, since no other wacko ever rang doorbells like that, but still mom checked the door before opening, no matter who it was.Dad and I made a list of what I now recognize to be codes and counters.He'd figure out some way to get the code to me, writing stuff onto the grocery list or circling things in the newspaper with red marker, stuff like that.I'd check with the notebook and ask for the password when he showed up at the door later.This went on for a year, until one morning I was looking for Dad in his office.He always went to work dressed in a black suit, coat, and a purple tie.The coat and purple tie were missing from the coat hanger in the corner.I found a hastily scribbled note on his desk that said "Went out for a pack of cigarettes."I knew this to be the code for a job that was absolutely safe and he'd be back in 30 minutes or less.It didn't look like Dad's handwriting to me, but I knew that nobody else had knew about the codes, not even my mother or my siblings.I assumed he was in a hurry and went about my day.After a day and a half of his absence I began to worry.I shared my concerns, and the codes, with my mother and she just reassured me that he'd be fine, and it wouldn't be much longer until he returned.A week went by.A month.\[Continued in reply\]
