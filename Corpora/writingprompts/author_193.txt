Harry made his way down the long hallway with bated breath.He'd never been called to the big boss' office before, but he had seen others come back from there just to pack up their desk and hand in their badge.Was he headed the same way?His last mission had been a close call, but damn it, he'd made it work.As he wiped his forehead, the door ahead swung open.Harry made the final steps towards it and looked through the open doorway.There was nothing there.No chair, no desk, no people, not even a window.The gut feeling that had saved him from countless deadly situations kicked in once more.He leaned back to read the sign beside the door, but it hadn't changed in the last few seconds."Detective Harry Blackwell," boomed a loud voice from inside the room, startling Harry who instinctively reached for his gun.His hand remained empty, as both holster and gun were safely stowed away at his desk."Enter," the voice dictated.His curiosity got the better of him, and he stepped inside the empty room.As soon as he passed the threshold the door swung shut behind him."Is this some kind of joke?"He said out loud.Chief Daniels had been the one to send him down here, but he had less of a sense of humor than a chicken."This," answered the voice, "is your chance to become more powerful than you ever thought possible.All you have to do, is find me."Find who?And in an empty room no less.While listening, Harry had been searching for the source of the voice.It seemed to come from multiple hidden speakers, but it was hard to tell as the sound reverberated off the bare walls.The room was dimly lit by a small lamp hanging from the ceiling.It was too weak to reach the furthest corners so he decided to try his luck there first.Alas, all four corners contained nothing but dust.If this was some sort of mystery room, shouldn't there at least be something, anything to give him a clue?Harry turned back towards the door and discovered a light switch.He flipped it and all was pitch black.However, for the briefest of moments, he saw a narrow beam of light in the far left corner.Or had it been a trick of the mind?He turned the lights back on and made his way across the room once more.As before, there was nothing but dust, but that light... had it been there?"What is this shit?"He asked in frustration.No answer.Harry knelt down to examine where the floor and walls joined.As he hovered his fingers over the corner, he felt a breeze of air.Reaching into his back pocket, Harry found his trusted pocket knife.His dad had gifted the knife to him on his 10th birthday and he'd been carrying it around ever since.He unfolded the knife and slid it between the wall and floor.With one wiggle of the blade and an audible click, the two walls came apart in a narrow slit.Harry took one last look behind him, into the dimly lit room, and then pushed the walls completely apart.Behind them was a steep staircase leading downwards into darkness."Guess I'm doing this, huh."He said and stepped down.The stairs were so narrow, he had to take them sideways.The further down he went, the darker it became, till it was pitch black.With his hand on the wall in front of him and careful steps, he made his way down the stairs, till he'd reached the end."Congratulations."Harry jolted in shock at the low whisper, realizing it came from right behind him."Who's there?"He asked with hands raised, ready for combat."Relax," the voice said, now coming from straight in front of him."I won't hurt you."At once, a lamp was lit and Harry could see the owner of the voice: it was a tall man, dressed in a crisp, gray suit."What is this?"Harry had never seen this man before and it sure as hell wasn't the big boss."Well, detective, we've been following your career and it is time that you join our ranks and become a ninja.""Fuck you!"Harry exclaimed.So this was a joke after all.He turned in anger to leave up the stairs, but in a split second, his path was blocked by the stranger."What the...?"Harry mumbled.The other man had moved with a pace that simply wasn't possible."Leave now and your time in the force is over.Stay, and you will learn the ninja ways.""Ninja ways?This is the God damn US of A, not Japan.Cut the crap and tell me what's going on."As he watched, the tall man seemed to fade from sight until he was no longer visible."This is what's going on."Harry felt chills running down his spine.Had he really just seen a man disappear before his eyes?He reached out to where the man had been and jerked back as he made contact with the unseeable man's body."What?How is that even possible?"Harry stuttered, while searching for proof of this thing being a magic trick.Mirrors, string, anything."I'm a ninja," said the invisible stranger, "and you can be one too."
