*Silence.*

I sat in that bland room for an eternity.The cold, claustrophobia of that empty grey cube my only company for aeons upon aeons.Time was nothing, but I still felt it pass.Purgatory.Bollocks."I probably deserve this."That was my first thought.Always one to self-deprecate I suppose.Nevertheless, I could make good use this place.or lack of place.I sat there, stewing in my mind, playing with scenarios like I always did, contemplating things, drifting in and out of my familiar depressive habits.I'd gotten rid of those years ago, with some help, but when all you have are your memories and imagination, things tend to repeat.*Light.*

I shut my eyes to halt the blinding rays, not that it did me much good.The all-encompassing grandness that I was within could not be held back.Then again, I don't suppose I had eyelids at that point.Then it was gone.*Home.*

My childhood home, where I felt my best and worst.I'd moved on, of course, but this would always be my happy place, my place of comfort.I felt a physical sensation run through me, and realized I could walk, so I did.I went back to my bedroom, and sat on my bed, the cool sheets and duvet a reminder of what I'd been through.Life.I had been through life."I never understood why."I turned left, to my desk chair.Ah.That is not who I would have expected to see.I'd rather hoped never to see them again.My shame was enough of a punishment, their face was an uncomfortable reminder of the worst aspects of myself.Perhaps this was purgatory, that sempiternal grey room left me to my own thoughts after all, it wasn't all bad."Negative.Positive.Death.Life.I am the first."Oh goody.I'd have to deal with three more.At least the two of them sounded okay."You were so unkind to me.Your own father.You said things that made me hurt inside in ways that no one could.I never understood.I couldn't.But now I do.And I forgive you.I have seen all that you saw.Felt all that you felt.And It's okay.I love you."And he was gone.And she was there."Mum."My tears hurt.I didn't want to see her again, I knew it would hurt too much."My beautiful, baby boy.Come here."I launched myself into her arms, holding back screams as I cried.I held her for an eternity."Shh.It's okay.It's all fine.I missed you so much.I love you.You made me so happy.So, so, happy.Every memory spent with you, even at your worst, is one I will cherish forever."And she was gone.I wasn't ready.I never was.Not then.Not now.Not ever.I screamed.Minutes past.I stared at the floor, kneeling before the desk chair  she had arrived on.I looked up again."Grandad?"I didn't understand.He'd died when I was five, I barely recognized him.But I knew.I'd loved him unconditionally, before disease stole him from us."You don't understand.I didn't either, not at first.Eventually I realized though.I had to look deep into my mind, but I found out why.I found out why it was you fault."No.NO.It couldn't have been my fault, I was a child, barely a toddler.Cancer took him.How could it be MY FAULT?!"Your mother told you this, I believe.When you were but a babe, I held you up, and I saw something unbelievable.I looked into your eyes and it looked like you knew something I didn't.Like you'd been there before.I didn't even believe in that kind of stuff, but I still told your Gran, that feeling was so strong.And I was right.You had a second chance.A chance to give warning, so everything wouldn't be stolen from you too soon...But you forgot.It wasnt fair, and I will never hold it against you.But your choice to forget, to live it all again, it did this.And I'm so glad you chose that.Nobody should bear the weight you would have carried.You did the right thing.I love you."He was gone.I didn't understand.I sat back on my bed and stewed in my thoughts.I don't know how long I thought for before it stuck.Before I understood.A second chance.And I didn't take it.*Why?*

I didn't know.But I understood now.Cruelty.Kindness.Death... 

Where was life.I felt weak.Empty.Far more empty than in that empty box even.I was missing something.I turned grey.I waited.One more had to come.They HAD to, right?*Wrong.*

Not everyone saves a life.Not everyone causes a death.Some of us just live.we are, then we are not.And at the end, we are missing something.A fundamental piece of the puzzle.I had three pieces.But I had never collected the fourth.I had never saved a life.And so, I could never finish it.Finish this.*I understood.*

And I crumbled to dust.And nothing is left of what once was.*I understand.*

Nothing.
