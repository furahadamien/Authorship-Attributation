We had grown accustomed to not seeing him sitting at the dining room table reading the morning newspaper before breakfast.At least that what Id tell myself.Hed just sit there hidden behind articles, and only his hand would occasionally, reach for his cup of freshly brewed coffee.The hand would disappear with the mug behind the paper after a few sips it would reappear and put the cup back on the table.Freeing the hand to flip the page.Hed always have the whole house smelling like coffee.I dont know how he and mom could stand it, but nowadays I kind of miss it.Mom would be behind him, cooking our breakfast and our lunches for the day.When shed cook, the house would smell of eggs and bacon.Mm, the aroma of greatness.But even that doesnt happen as often anymore.When I come down the stairs in the hall, I see the ghost of days past.Creeping down the steps before school, just hoping Id see him sitting at the table again through the doorway to the kitchen from the hall.When I come down stairs these days, theres a note left on the table in front of a plate of cold breakfast with a glass cover over it.Dont forget your lunch is in the fridge, Love, Mom. It says.The kitchen is just as cold as my breakfast is by the time I wake up, get down stairs, and eat.Id sit, there scooping at the cold eggs, not bothering to reheat the food, but instead stare at the backyard door dad would stand at to smoke his cigarettes, before mom would call him to come eat.Now we hardly ever open those sliding doors.Though, ever since I stole the seat dad used to sit in at our small, square, kitchen table.I always imagine hes still there.Taking a smoke before breakfast.Just waiting for him to come back inside and say, Hey, you got your own seat kiddo. As hed smile and wave me to my seat.Then that sweeping anger swells in me like every other time I get to this point.But if he didnt smoke, he would be gone!He would never have left!He would be here!It's all the cigarettes fault he never came back!This always happens.It reaches the point of realization that, I took out my anger on cigarettes, and blamed them for my fathers disappearance.Though, It was my fault ten years ago, we had a drug awareness guest speaker in my class.He told us all about how bad cigarettes are, so when I got home that day, I thought Id help my dad quit by sneaking into my parents bedroom, grabbing his pack of cigarettes, and throwing them away for him.I was sure hed quit if his cigarettes just werent there anymore.But the next morning, he said, Ill be back, just going to go buy some more cigarettes. My mission to get him to quit smoking backfired.And He never come home after that.Mom called the police, and they searched for days, weeks, for any signs of him or his car.But nothing turned up.Eventually they called off the search, and just like my appetite just seemed to call off for thinking of all that.It was time for school anyway, so I grabbed my stuff hanging off the back of the chair I was supposed to be sitting in, and then my lunch before heading towards the front door.Though as I was entering the hall from the kitchen the front door unlocked itself, and it opened.W-Who are you, and how did you get in my house!? he shouted, dropping his bag to the floor.Three packs of cigarettes slid out of the bag onto the hall floor.He was wearing the same clothes as that day.Dad?

Do I know you?

Its me, your daughter!

Dont be ridiculous, my daughter is only six years old!, Im calling the police! He said stomped towards me to get to the phone we kept in the kitchen.Dad, no!Seriously it's me!Youve been gone for ten years!

He walks into the kitchen.He was looking for the wired phone we used to have hanging on the wall next to the door frame.Now we have a cordless phone sitting on the counter on the other side of the fridge.Though he couldnt see it.What?Where did the house phone go?Did you vandalize my property?Hid my phone away, so we cant call the police in case you got caught here?

Dad, Im serious it's me!Im still the same girl!Your little summer sunshine!

He looked at me, investigate every inch of my face.He walked closer and stared deep into my eyes.You do kind look like my wife, but but that would be impossible He lifted his wrist watch, and checked the time, Ive only been gone for half an hour?

More like half an hour and thirty minutes.

He walked over to the kitchen table as if in a daze.He hovered over the kitchen table hold himself up with his hands propped on the table.Then Where is your mother?

Since youve been gone for so long, she had to get a job to keep up with the bills, I paused for a moment, Mom has a cell phone, so I thought it might be best to call and let her speak to him.I can call mom if you want.

Yeah, do that he said, still hunched over the table, dazed.I called mom, but instead of her speaking with dad over the phone she insisted that she had to come home and see for herself.About forty-five minutes later, the front door swings open, her keys jingling wildly as she storms into the kitchen, finding us standing in an awkward silence.She walks over to dad, looks him up and down, then gives him a good slap on the face.Where the hell have you been for the past ten years!?Do you Do you know what you put this family through! she choked up in disbelief and tears.She dropped her keys, then fell to her knees.She had always told me, If he ever showed back up, she would give dad a piece of her mind.But even I started tearing up when I realized he was back, he was actually back after all this time.He knelt down and lift mom back to her feet and held her in his arms.Im sorry.Im so sorry. He hesitated, but he then explained to mom the same thing he explained to me, but instead he even showed her his watch.Dad always wore one of those fancy sports watches that kept track of time, date and altitude.It was a pretty cool sports watch even if it was a bit dated by todays standards.Since we have smart watches and all.However, on the watch it was still the same date as when he first disappeared.He walked us outside to even show us the mileage on the car which read less than ten miles had been put on the cars odometer.And the store he went to is only five miles away, so it was just a trip there and back.Mom stood confused, she didnt understand.Nor did I.How did you disappear for ten years then? this makes little sense. Mom had asked the question Im sure we all wanted answered at this point.
