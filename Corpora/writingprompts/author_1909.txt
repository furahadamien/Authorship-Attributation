I've seen it all.Inch long punctures from a pike, the multiple miniature holes left by a machine gun leaving somone just enough time to face their fate before they expire, the feeling of which i may never know despite their attempts at killing me.Ive seen every imagined excuse for the slaughter, from "holy" crusade to piracy, Those who kill often do so in the name of my commander.Those who die too often have done so with an image of his son clinging in their hands.I look at the newest one beneath me.My hands couldnt save her and I wonder if mercury couldve dulled the pain.Taken her away from it.But no, the nurses would not let me.She looks to be maybe 6.Driven here frantically by a father who was probably the target of the drone strike that killed his daughter.This new crusade is much like the old.Fighting over the land in which my commander walked.The truly just war.Since humans have only sought to take this land one from the other because their leader lusts for its magical power, not for the man who once walked its stones.The next litter is carried in, a man cut with a knife.A wound so familiar.A wound i could have treated many years ago, had i only the means.I am Gabriel, and i have seen war from both sides.Yet now i try in vain to save these humans from themselves.
