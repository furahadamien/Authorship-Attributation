Thats what Im trying to tell you! said the man standing in front of me.No way I could believe what he was telling me.So, wait... youre telling me that in reality, the only reason we grow old and die is because the people on this planet continue to have sex and reproduce and that baby that is born takes life away from others and youre an alien?Do I have that right?

Not only do you have that right but youre an alien also

So what do you want me to do about it?Kill all these children being born?

Not exactly.Theres another way.You can be immortal without killing anyone on this planet

Ok.Whats the catch?

Do you know how to use a sword?

BORN TO BE KINGS!PRINCES OF THE UNIVERSE!!!
