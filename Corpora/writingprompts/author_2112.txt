Since I was born I heard that voice.Being diagnosed with schizophrenia, talking with other patients, I learned to accept it.The thing is, for me the sickness always seemed different to what other people experienced.My voice was completely off to what happened around me, basically narrating someone elses life.I could interact with it though, drawing its attention if I ever needed advice by a strong thought.Got to say the other me is damn good at math, she helped me at my final physics exam.I feel like I cheated but my doctors told me it was a part of me and there is nothing wrong with seeking my support.She even gave me dating advise, made my wife Fall for me.Weve been happily married for 6 years now, my voice always reminds me of our anniversary.The thing is, its the other way around to.I can here her constantly babble about what do buy at the grocery store (girl, doesnt matter if the ice cream is off, were on a diet!)or which job to apply for.I blend her out most days because I cant think straight otherwise.Recently it changed though.First I thought I lost her, several weeks without a strangers thought made in my head.I was devastated, than happy, shocked, depressed.Then suddenly, on your average Monday morning she asked me where I was.I told her, she knows my address as we bought the house together anyways...Yet she went quiet.For a whole 24 h.

Ill come for you she said.im nearly there she added.Looking forward to meet the wife I felt like she was smiling.I cant get away, she knows where Id go.I dont know what to do.I feel here coming closer.Get a grip!Shes not real!Oh, I am.Turn around
