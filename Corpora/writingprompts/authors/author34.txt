"How you doing today, Boss?" I asked the wounded sparrow in the cage. He was no bigger than the palm of my hand, yet he felt so much larger than me. He always stood with his head held high, which always made me think he was looking down on me. It's part of why I called him Boss.

Boss didn't respond, just looked at me furtively, not quite putting a place on where I stood in his head. Perhaps he still thought of me as a stranger that kidnapped him. I brought him his food delicately, placing it in the cage in front of him, but making sure not to get too close to him. I didn't want to spook him.

He chirped at me. I couldn't tell whether it was from gratitude or from some other communication. He hopped down nimbly, careful not to use his injured wing and ate heartily at its meal of seeds.

"I think you'll be good to go in the next few days, Boss," I said while I put its food away. Boss chirped again. It sounded like he was conversing with me this time. I responded jokingly,

"Yeah, it is pretty dark in here, let's get you some natural sunlight," I said to him. I walked over to the curtain and put my hand out to find it was already open completely. It was odd since I checked the weather and it was supposed to be sunny all day today. I looked up at the sky and saw it was completely overcast. I frowned and checked my phone again. It still read as a sunny day.

"Hey, Boss, you ever heard of the weather being this far off..." I trailed when I heard the sound of the storm coming outside. When the sound reached him, Boss went into a frenzy, attempting to fly around his cage and smacking every wall as fast as he could. His injured wing did little for mobility and he was half flying and half hobbling around, but fully bashing into the cage.

"Hey, hey, it's okay Boss, it's just a little storm cloud. It'll pass, I've been through a million of these. In fact, you'll be sheltered from the rain in the house," I said, just speaking as much as I could to calm him down. Boss looked at me and gave me an expression I'd never seen on a bird before. He looked at me like I was stupid. Like I was a complete child. Then he chirped at me as loud as he could, smashing a foot on a wall of the cage he was in.

"You.. you want out?" I asked, feeling stupid for talking to him more seriously now.

He chirped in the affirmative.

"You--" I stopped myself from asking more questions. There was a blazing seriousness in his eyes. As I was about to unlock the cage, something smashed into my window with a *tweet!* I whipped my neck around to see another sparrow with a scar across his eye, looking directly at Boss. It tweeted mockingly to Boss and raised a wing to a cloud behind him.

No... not a cloud. It was a mass of hundreds-- thousands of birds flocking toward my house as one giant collective! Some began landing on next to the scarred bird while most others watched while flying from a distance. 

Boss chirped angrily at the scarred sparrow, raising his good wing for emphasis. 

"Uhh... What are you...? What is this?" I asked neither of them and both of them at the same time.

The scarred bird tweeted in a strange tone.. was he laughing? Then he chirped a command and flew back menacingly. Hawks and woodpeckers crowded my window and began pecking rapidly. 

"Should... should we run?" I asked Boss.

He tweeted affirmatively.

I threw the latch off and grabbed Boss who didn't even flinch. He just watched the scarred bird with menacing eyes. I ran out of the living room and into my bathroom, locking the door behind us. As soon as the lock turned, I heard the window break in the living room, the roar of thousands of birds cawing, screeching and chirping filled the room.

"What now?" I yelled to Boss over the noise. 

He chirped a few times, giving orders to me.

"I don't... what?" I asked.

He chirped and pointed straight up to the skylight with his beak.

"You want us to climb out of there?"

He chirped a few more times and then flapped a wing to himself, shaking his head at me. I squinted my eyes, a little worried that I thought I understood what he meant by that.

"You want me to throw you up at the coun--"

Hundreds of birds were scraping against the door now, it rattled in anticipation of its being torn open, leaving us at the birds' mercy. A bird shoved its way under my bathroom door. It was the scarred one again. It chortled mockingly, taking short hops with each of its tweets. It tweeted slowly, turning its head with glee and flapping its wings. Then it looked at Boss dead on and chirped with death in its tweet.

"Is he monologuing!?" I asked with disbelief.

Boss chirped angrily, but affirmatively.

"So, then, he's the bad guy-- er.. bird?"

Both birds tweeted affirmatively, albeit one more condescending than the other.

"Then, why don't I..." I threw the bathroom's trash bin over the small bird. It bashed its head against it a few times, then started tweeting desperately. I sympathized. There was some nasty stuff in there. Boss tweeted loudly; louder than I'd ever heard him tweet before and the commotion outside came to a halt. The scarred bird tweeted a few more times and I heard the entirety of the army outside flying out of my house. I sat there in disbelief as I heard all the caws, screeches, and chirps take flight away as quickly as they entered.

After a few more moments, Boss pecked at my hand to be put down. He went to the bin to talk to the other bird while I opened the door. The entire apartment was absolutely covered in feathers and bird poop. I sighed and slunked out of the bathroom, unable to comprehend anything that just happened. I turned back to Boss.

"You're paying for this, right?" I asked.

He chirped affirmatively.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

I walked around my apartment, surveying the damage. There were hardly two inches unscathed by the mounds of bird poop, feathers, or both. I ran my hand over the outside of the bathroom door, feeling the hundreds of dents and ridges caused by the birds that had just left. I sighed and grabbed a dustpan to get started on the cleanup.

Boss chirped loudly from the bathroom as I knelt down to begin cleaning. I immediately gagged and got back up. I'd need some sort of mask filled with pleasant scents to get that close to it. Boss tweeted again, a little louder.

"Are you calling for me?"

Boss tweeted a short affirmation.

"Coming," I said, watching my footing. 

Boss had managed to hop on top of the trash bin and stood at the height of magnificence. He let out a little chirrup and pecked on top of the bin. I rolled my eyes.

"Yeah, good job Boss, you stopped Scar. I'm very proud of you," I said monotonously, turning around. He tweeted again, beating his beak against the bin again. Scar tweeted in agreement. I frowned.

"You want me to do something to Scar?" I asked hesitantly. Boss nodded in a quick jerk of his tiny head. He pecked the bin yet again. I swallowed.

"You want me to.. kill him?" I whispered. Scar began tweeting in hysterics. He would rapidly drone out a dozen tweets, then a moment later chirp a dozen more. Boss didn't look too happy about it. He tapped a chastizing claw against the top and Scar stopped. Boss tweeted apologetically.

"Is he tweeting bad words?" I asked. Boss raised a wing and bobbed his head as if to indicate: *More or less.* 

"Yeah, I guess that makes sense since he has to die and all," I said, shrugging it off. Both Scar and Boss tweeted simultaneously in the negative. I frowned again. I kneeled down to Boss's height, not helping me feel less like he was looking down at me.

"What are we gonna do with him, then?" I asked conspiratorially. Scar tweeted condescendingly. He could still hear me. Boss chirped two quick twitters and pecked around the bin at even intervals. I stared, not putting it together. Scar chirped weakly, imploring me to understand. He sounded like he was dying... Like he was running out of--

"Air holes!?" I exclaimed, causing Boss to jump to the other end of the bin. He tweeted emphatically, urging me to do it as fast as possible. I ran to the kitchen and pulled my tool drawer open. I looked for a drill, but I didn't own any. Just a screwdriver, a hammer, a few nails, and a wrench. Boss tweeted more urgently. Scar also let out a cry for help; a small, frail whine that barely reached the kitchen. I grabbed all the tools at once and ran back. 

"I uhh... I don't have a drill or anything. Should I just pick up the bin?" I showed him my hands with the supplies. Boss chirped a firm no and hopped onto my hand. He pecked a nail then hopped and tapped a hammer. He looked up quickly, seeing if I understood.

"I got it," I said, placing a nail on top of the bin. I raised the hammer and Boss hopped to my shoulder, calling order to Scar. Probably told him to duck down. Scar didn't respond. I smashed a hole, then a few more until there were enough that I felt confident that the little guy could breathe in there. Boss hopped down and chirped down a hole, waiting for a response. He chirped again, looking at me with... was that fear in his eyes.

Scar responded begrudgingly.

Boss warbled a bit at me something that sounded like gratitude, but I wasn't sure. I nodded just nodded my head, dumbly. Before I could ask Boss anything more, there was a ring at the doorbell. Boss stood at attention and I sat perfectly still. We had no trouble hearing them since the window next to them was broken in.

"Hey, Sean, this is Martha. I just wanted to check-in. We got six noise complaints all within the span of the last fifteen minutes so I wanted to see if everything was okay. Some people reported animal noises? You know pets aren't allowed, right?" 

My heart hopped down into my stomach. It was my landlord. Boss and I looked at each other. He nudged his head that I should get the door. I shook my head quickly. He urged further. Scar laughed from in his smelly cage. 

"Shut up, you," I hissed.

"I'm letting myself in, okay?" she said, the sound of keys rang as clear as the eviction notice the mess my in place would elicit. 

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I heard footsteps pattering off in the darkness of the night sky. The steps happened at awkward intervals like one leg was shorter than the other. I also heard the muffled scream of my daughter. I grit my teeth. I wasn't worried. 

I was angry.

"Sparkles!" I called. Flying around the corner, a shining beacon of light in the darkness flew Sparkles, the glowing horse. She landed in front of me daintily and looked around restlessly. I put my hand to her mane, compassionately. She calmed down considerably by the meal. She ate love and pooped rainbow diamonds. 

"She's been taken," I told Sparkles. Sparkles reared in anger, urging me to get on her back. I could barely hop on before Sparkles launches into the air, nearly leaving me behind. I gripped the gun tightly and pulled myself to a balanced position. 

"Do you know where you're going!?" I called, not sure if the wind would carry my voice away at the speed we were going. Sparkles pulled herself to a halt and I was launched into her neck. I probably would have broken my nose had I not been 'so hard to hurt that not even bullets make him hurt sometimes.' I took my time to smile at the memory of her despite myself. I had no sense of urgency. I wished I could worry. 

Sparkles looked on the street below, which had been illuminated by dozens of spotlights that originated from her magnificent body. I surveyed along with her taking in the city as it flashed in and out of view. I saw a handful of cars making their way home, a water tower that had been imploded, but no sign of my daughter. 

"Sparkles, I think they went that w--" the world blurred around me as Sparkles immediately darted in the direction I pointed. We flashed by blocks of the neighborhood before I reared up Sparkles. She resisted at first but came to a stop again. She looked back at me, waiting for an order. I pointed to the park we were next to.

"I think we used to come here before she died," I said to Sparkles. Sparkles indicated that she didn't know what that meant with a twist of her head, but made her way inside the park slowly. I rolled off her back and walked beside her, watching the lights of the horse flash pieces of the park. A jungle gym. Water fountain. Soccer field. I gripped my gun tightly when I saw the swingset. There were figures on it. I made my way over quickly, knowing they'd seen the entrance Sparkles made. 

On the swings were my wife and daughter, drifting back and forth. My wife looking at me with her sunken eye and my daughter with her eyes closed, tears streaming down her face. She was no longer petting our daughter but instead holding something with the hand that wasn't clamped over her mouth. Sparkles huffed and I put a hand to her head to try and calm her down. Then I saw the gleam of a knife next to my daughter's face. The same knife I'd used the last time she'd come back.

I cocked the gun.

"Put her down," I ordered. 

From her mother came a weak whisper, one that wouldn't have been heard had it not been for the dead of night. Her voice was the loudest she could make it with the remains of her vocal cords. 

"Tongue," she responded, looking down to the knife. 

"I said, put her down!" I demanded. She brought the knife closer to her mouth, inserting it under the hand she had clamped over the mouth. 

"No tongue, no more power," she slipped the weapon further inside her mouth. Our daughter began crying a muffled scream, trying to wrench the hand off of her face. I ran forward, but my wife looked at me sharply, a fire in her eye. 

"No gun," she said. 

I was burning with the rage of knowing my daughter had been harmed. I was ready to explode. Ready to tear the woman I once loved apart, limb from limb for causing this strife to her own daughter. 

"What!?" I screamed, freezing in place.

"No gun." She moved the skin over her eyes, probably what her eyebrow would have been to point to it. "No problem," she pointed to the knife. The ghoulish wisps of her hair shook in the night wind. 

"I put the gun down and you'll put the knife down? No cutting our daughter?" I asked, my knuckles white on the gun. I had no intention of firing a weapon like this when my daughter was in range. She did not respond. The only motion the tears continuing to flow down our daughter's face. We stared in silence for a moment, then she moved the knife infinitesimally closer to her mouth. 

"Fine! Fine!" I said once arm raised as I knelt slowly to put the gun down. Sparkles neighed disapprovingly, scraping her hooves on the grass. I looked at her from the corner of my eyes and tried to signal her. She was glaring at the specter of my wife. 

"What do you want?" I asked, warily.

She looked up to us and then across her body. Its misshapen existence, barely holding itself together even as she sat on the swing. Her face wrinkled into a frown. A tear rolled down from her one eye.

"I don't want to come back anymore," she said, quietly. "It hurts so much."

I blinked. This wasn't about having our daughter but stopping her from returning and dying over and over.

"This doesn't have to happen this way, I can make it happen, just put the knife down," I pleaded.

She didn't even look up at me.

"No more power," she decided. 

She moved her hand further in her mouth and I shouted, smacked Sparkles, and sprinted at her. Sparkles exploded in light, rearing up in anger and fear. The light blinded my wife and her armed hand went to the side as she protected her vision. I tackled the arm covering our girl's mouth, pulling it clean off. Our daughter screamed as the bloody display made itself known to us, her cheek torn open and the knife still inside. 

I grabbed my wife's hand and tore the knife out and pulled our daughter behind me, who clung to me and cried.

"I'm sorry," I said softly. She didn't try to fight it. I stabbed the knife into her head again and her body crumpled to the floor. 

I whipped around and gripped my daughter tightly as she wailed into the night.

"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry sweetie, I'm sorry," I said, running my hand through her hair. She could do nothing but wail in fear and pain, not loosening her grip on me at all. I was stoic, comforting her out of compassion, but not worry.

We couldn't do what we normally did, which was to make her say she wanted to forget what happened. That would only lead to this scenario again with another conversation steering to her mother. And I was willing to believe that my wife is more brutal than to her than even the atrocities she did this time around.

"Honey, sweetie, I need you to something," I said urgently. Sparkles had come to nuzzle her affectionately. My little girl looked up at me, tears blinding her and screaming in pain. She nodded at me, allowing me to continue.

"Say you don't want to hurt anymore," I said.

She continued to cry, shaking her head in confusion.

"Just say it please," I said with as much love as I could muster. She nodded hesitantly.

"I 'o' wa' hurt aeeore," she mustered through cut tongue and cheek. Immediately, the wounds on her face mended themselves, leaving tiny scars in their place. She looked even more confused and continued to sniffle. 

"Now, say you never want--" I hesitated at the thought of this and its consequences, but I had to do it for her safety. "Say you never want to think of Mommy again." 

She looked at the corpse beside us and did little to hesitate.

"I don't wanna think about Mommy ever again," she declared, a dazed look striking her eyes as it came to be.

"Say, you want to remember this as a dream," I said, pulling her in close.

"Why?" she asked, not clearly remembering the events when her mother was out of the picture.

"Please," I asked.

"I want to remember this as a dream," she said, her eyelids closing. She collapsed in my arms, asleep. She short breaths, like she was having a nightmare. I carried her home, Sparkles lighting the way.

I didn't know how much longer I could keep up being the best dad, but I would stop at nothing to achieve it.__________________________________________________
I shook a little in place, then whipped the brush out and ran back to my daughter, holding her close to me as I brushed her hair frantically. 

"Everything okay, Daddy?" she asked, tapping her spoon against the ice cream tub.

"You--" I swallowed hard, slowing down the brushing as much as I could to calm myself down. "You don't really want Mommy to be here, honey. You are okay with her passing, remember? We talked about this," I urged.

She thought about the conversation for a second.

"I changed my mind," she said, plainly. 

My heart hammered against my chest, trying to escape its confines. The anxiety of the conversation hurt me. 

"No, you don't," I said before I could stop myself. She looked back at me defiantly. I looked at her with fear.

"Yeah huh! I want Mommy here right now!" she objected. I dropped the brush and ran into the bedroom.

"Daddy?" she called behind me.

I threw the closest open and tore all the clothes out, revealing a lone briefcase. The doorbell rang. I gasped loudly and threw the briefcase open and hesitating before grabbing its contents. There was a scratch at the door. 

"I'll get it!" she called from the living room.

"***NO!***" I exploded, but I couldn't get up. She said she would get it. I grabbed the shotgun out of the case and loaded it while my feet refused to listen to me. I heard her fumbling for the lock that was right out of her reach. The scratching on the door became more frantic. I turned my head to watch her down the hall. She went to go grab a chair to stand on.

"Please, honey!" I begged, pulling at my legs to get up. I couldn't move toward the front door. Not until she opened it to the nightmare on the other side. "Please let me answer the door! Don't open the door without me there, remember?? Sweetie!!!" I screamed, my knuckles white over my calf. I couldn't move. She came back into view. I saw the chair being dragged to the door. 

"Don't worry," she assured, balancing herself on the chair. As I was about to call out again, all my anxieties and fears were swept away. There was absolutely nothing to be worried about in this situation. I wasn't allowed to worry. My body was still tense and the adrenaline was pumping through me with the force of a waterfall, but it was lasting effects of emotions that had left me. 

A bead of sweat made its way down my neck when the door was unlocked and was swung open. Her mother jumped on her with arms reached out. Before she could cry out in fear, her mother had clamped her hands over her mouth with broken hands. Then, in a sharp motion, my formerly deceased wife looked over to me.

Her hair was wisps on her head, held there by the strongest roots that had not decayed in all these years. One eye was missing, and the other placed haphazardly in a sunken hole of frail flesh in her head. Her mouth and nose were shadows of their former self, single layers of skin keeping it together. The hands were wrinkled and falling apart, flecks of skin peeling off with every motion. Her body was a narrow, incomplete puzzle, with random intestines hanging out and pieces missing here and there.

Our daughter looked between her mother and me with her eyes wide. She whimpered under her mother's grasp, but the hand gripped tighter on her. I placed my firearm on the ground and rose my hands up slowly. 

"Please," I whispered. "Put her down."

My wife looked down at our daughter, knowing what would happen if she were to release her grip on her mouth. With her free hand, she ran a finger through our daughter's hair. Our daughter began to cry. I took a step toward her. 

She pulled our daughter closer to her, protectively and looked at me with a mix of rage and fear in her eye. She ran off, sprinting away from the house. I stood up slowly, gathering my gun and walking out the open door. I still wasn't allowed to be worried. I probably wouldn't be worried even if I was able to be. I was the best dad alive. 

How could the best dad not be his daughter's hero?

_________________________________________________________________________She was fuming, staring at the wall. She was soaked from head to toe, dripping onto the couch. 

"Hey, sweetie, if you wanna talk about it now, it's okay," I said cautiously. I made her wait to talk about the situation since she typically said things that I would regret whenever incidents were still fresh in her mind.

"I wish Gabby was d--"

"Wait!" I yelled, running to the freezer. She looked up curiously as I brought her a full tub of vanilla ice cream and cake on the side. Her face lit up and she jumped up and down in her chair. I placed the treats before her and she grabbed the tub and a spoon. About an inch away from beginning to eat she stopped and looked at me. 

"Do you want any?" she said in her sweet voice. 

"Daddy can't have any, sweetie. Too many sweets and I get fat. I already had cake with you this morning, remember?" I said, grabbing a towel and putting it to her hair. 

"Oh yeah... I wish you could always eat with me and not get fat..." she said as she began eating. I felt something adjust in my intestines. I decided to ignore that while she might still have anger in mind and figure out what that actually meant later. 

"Do you like your ice cream?" I asked, moving down to take off her wet socks.

"Yeah, but I didn't have a good day at school today," she said. She was pressing the issue. It would only be moments before insisted she wanted to talk about it and I'd be forced to oblige.

"Oh, yeah? What happened today?" I asked, poking her stomach. She laughed. Everything I did seemed to either make her smile or laugh ever since she declared I was the best dad ever. 

"Well, today at school when we finished the day and Mr. Tin said we can put all the watercolors away, we went to the bathroom to clean the things and Gabby came in with me so I said that I had fun painting things but instead of saying anything she threw a bucket of water on my and was laughing the whole time," she said, somehow in one breath. I released the tension in my body. One statement goes awry and Gabby could have a very hard time. 

"Ah, so you didn't just jump in the toilet before I picked you up from school?" I asked. She giggled again. It was good to see her smile. 

"Did you tell her that it upset you?" I asked. She scooped more ice cream into her mouth and thought while chewing. 

"Yeah, I told her that it wasn't nice to throw water at people but we weren't in the class anymore we were at the pick-up part of the school when you were driving in to pick me up in the magic car," she said. I nodded, moving to dry off parts of her clothes now. 

"Don't you think it--"

"I wish she knew what it was like to have a lot of water on you when you didn't want it," she said confidently. 

"You don't need to say things like that.." I said slowly.

"Why not?" 

"I think you'd be happy getting an apology from Gabby, don't you?"

"Ok, I wish Gabby got an apology," she said mischievously.

"An apology is her saying that she's sorry, sweetie," I said, as I began wondering what her last sentence would lead to.

"Oh... I want Gabby to say sorry to me," she agreed. 

"That's good," I said, dropping my phone into her lap. She looked at it for a moment, quizzically, when it went off with a call from Gabby's father. I acted surprised and answered the phone.

"Hey Drake," I said.

"Hello!? Is... I don't know what's gotten into Gabby!" he said, panicked. 

"What do you mean," I said, worried.

"A water tower just bust open on top of her, hit her with torrents of water! I thought she was going to drown. Then she gets out of it fine, soaked to the bone!! Not two minutes later, the mayor came to apologize to her personally, now the only thing she wants to do is say sorry to your daughter for something she did at school. Look, I have no idea what's going on, but she's very serious about this and I can't get her to do anything else," he said, hurriedly. 

"Ah, girls will be girls," chuckled, relieved that the damage hadn't caused her any serious injury. 

"What!?"

"I'll put her on the phone now, go ahead and put Gabby on," I said, handing the phone to my daughter, looking at me with a handful of cake in her mouth.

"Hello?" she said. "Hi, Gabby. It's okay. Okay. Let's be friends, okay? Okay!" she said, lighting up. I wasn't sure I wanted to let Gabby influencing my daughter when she went around dumping water on people, but it was out of my hands now. She hung and gave me back my phone, going back to the cake at hand.

"You want to go brush out your hair and get into your pajamas now?" I asked.

"Can you brush my hair?"

"Of course, just your mother was always so much better at it," I said, going to get the brush.

"Oh, yeah... I wish Mommy was still alive," she said aimlessly. I froze, my hand around the handle to the drawer.

*Not again.*

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I smashed the machine open, bellowing at the pilot of it,

**"They sent you to die! Is that how you want to live? Perpetually dying by my hand?"**

It stared at my rock horrified, then stammered,

"Akja mo plee nolampa noo de."

"What's so hard to understand?? I will smash your face in with the rock and you will die. That's all there is to it. Don't you want to survive?" I screamed. I shoved my rock inside of its mouth as it attempted to spit acid at me. The backfire made its eyes bulge and it screamed in pain, but it was otherwise still alive. 

"You see that wall?" I pointed to the sky to the left of us. Its eyes followed my finger. "We're watched by your stupid council. They wait for me to do something, then they turn it off. You get it? If you just start this simulation with the intent of getting out, maybe we'll stand a chance! Try to remember!"

"Appa li!" It flailed a limb which I nimbly avoided and knocked its head to one side with my elbow. It stared at my face, astonished. It seemed to expect I would have killed it by now. Well, it wasn't wrong to think that, since I'd done it thousands of times now, but I just wanted to know if it would understand I want something from it. 

"The tower," I said, pointing to the building with a stern finger. "Can you do something about the tower? I could swear it has something to do with all of this! Just take it down, and we'll both be free."

It looked to the tower, then back at me. Its eyes made a quick dance between my rock, my face, and the tower. 

"Be free?" it mimicked. 

Tears stung at my eyes. The first response I'd forced out of these stupid things. But its eyes didn't stop its race, jumping between the three points while it chanted something to itself, condescending:

"Be free. Be free! Be free!! Befree!!! BEFREE!!!" it screamed, shaking its head wildly. 

"Uhh.. yeah," I lowered the rock, hoping it would do something else.

"**BEFREE! BEFREE!**"

"Maybe not be free? I don't know what's happening here, do you--"

"BEEEEEEEEEEEEE FREEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!" it yelled, its body suddenly convulsing. I shook violently, looking between my general direction and the tower. Its skin began bubbling until it exploded. I stared at the empty cockpit in shock. I was covered in its innards, and had once again made no progress. 

The simulation powered down and the aliens in the audience all looked at me in utter shock. The council was visibly shaken, refusing to make eye contact with me.

"Really?" I asked. "*That* was the worst thing I've done? Infanticide is cool with you all? The countless murders are all part of the plan, but this guy's explosion was the one thing out of place? I made it blow up before! Remember when I shoved the explosive down its throat and it ran into the building and killed everyone inside?"

No answer, they couldn't fully grasp what sin I had committed. Evidently, neither could I. I heard one of them sob. A handful of the audience members got up and left the room. I really crossed the line this time.

The head council member stood up, and looked gravely upon me. 

"B--" it stopped itself, thinking its words out carefully. "Bahla noma."

The scene began fading before me and I felt the pull of the simulation starting back up again.

"Wait!! But I changed it! It's not fair!" I yelled.

The world spun around me and I was dropped in front of a giant war machine training its guns on me.

I shook my head in disbelief, waiting for the machine to make its first move, but it remained frozen. I waited a couple more moments. Was the simulation buffering? I took a few steps back to get a good look at what the pilot was doing. But the cockpit was empty. There was nothing but the husk of the war machine. 

I changed the simulation.

__________________________________________________"Hey, kid, you want some powers?" I asked, opening my arms invitingly to the kiosk. He stopped mid-step, pulling out one of his earbuds and giving my stand a once over. He was sporting a college sweatshirt and a disappointed look.

"What kinda stuff you got?" he asked skeptically, still not turning to me.

"Oh, the best stuff. Illumination! Attraction! Absorption, you name it, we got it!" I said, pointing out each of the powers as I described it.

"Illumination?" he perked up. "I've been looking for one of those. What kind of illumination? I'm looking to make my eyes into flashlights at night so I can read in bed without a nightlight. Anything like that would do fine. How much?" As he approached me, pulled his other earbud out and it slowly slid itself down his body, organizing itself with the other bud and slipping into his pocket neatly. He'd bought powers before. He'd be a tough sell.

"For you, I'll give the student discount!" I said confidently. My confidence only grew when I saw his face turn brighter in anticipation. "What do you say to fifty dollars?" 

"Fifty!?" he exclaimed, practically bursting into laughter. "What will it do, make my butt glow in the dark?"

I laughed good-naturedly.

"No, no, it's much more like a flashlight like what you want. Just comes out your nostril. It's a powerful beam that can make anything you need easily seen. Twenty whopping lumens out of this guy, light up the night!" I said excitedly, slapping the power on the desk for him to take.

"Sorry, did you say nostrils?"

"It's great for close spaces like closets or getting your car keys into your car when it's dark out--"

"From my nostrils?" he repeated, completely deflated.

"Yes, that's right." I could almost feel locks tightening around his wallet. 

"And you know twenty lumens would barely be enough to read at night when it's coming out of my nose. I don't read with my neck up, you realize?"

"Not your cup of tea?" I swapped the power on the counter with another, giving it a hearty slap like the first. "What about an absorption power?"

"What kind of absorption?" he said, barely interested. I saw one of his earbuds sneaking out of his pocket.

"A cheap one!" I ran through my words as fast as I could muster. "It's amazing for mornings! Absorbs all the nutrients out of any type of vomit, whether animal or human! Get ready for the day in an instant with--"

"*Feces?!?*"

"Oh yes, they're rich in--"

"I'm not interested in running my hands over literal pieces of puke, man. I can't believe you're wasting my time!" The wires of his earbuds raced up his shirt but I slapped another power on the desk loud enough to shock him and his music players enough to stop all three.

"Attraction! It's the hottest thing around!" I yelled, desperation crawling in my voice.

"Look, man, I really don't need any attraction. What's the catch on this one, like attract poop from all directions to the user of the power?" he said, upset. My eyes skirted to the power in my wares that actually did that, but I quickly went back to the pitch.

"No! Much better! Attracts a group of wasps who want to sting your eyes, they'll come charging straight for you!" I said rapidly.

"Are you serious? They'll come darting right for me?" he asked. It wasn't in anger, but interest.

"That's right, and sting your eyes if they make it," I repeated.

"How do they come at you? Like in a straight line?" he asked, genuinely.

"That's right. One after another," I said warily. I tried to read what he was getting at.

"So, if I have a power that makes wasps collapse one at a time, then this would allow me to use that power one at a time and feed the things to my venus fly traps?" he asked, excitedly. I slammed my hands on the table in excitement, hiding the $2 price tag that I'd hoped he hadn't seen.

"That's absolutely possible! And it can be yours for only twenty dollars!" 

"Oh, you got a deal man, this is gonna be awesome!" he said, pulling out his wallet giddily.

I finished the transaction with a beaming smile wishing him a good day and asking him to come again. I sighed contentedly and looked at the day's profits. About $500 in total. Not bad, all things considered. I just wished I had a better power than "make pretty stupid powers that you aren't allowed to use."I shook my head in disbelief.

*Again?*

It seems they really never got tired of this. A massive war-machine loomed before me, training its guns on me. It was 20 feet tall, with four, long, bionic legs holding up its head, which contained its guns. I groaned before walking calmly below it. Many simulations ago, I would be shot by the thing, but I hadn't felt any pain from these simulations for ages now. The guns began spinning rapidly, preparing to mow me down, but once I got immediately below it, the guns would no longer be able to aim at me. 

"Are we not tired of using the same simulation every time?" I called out to the machine. I hesitated for a moment while its pilot realized that simply sitting down would crush me. I took two steps to the right and grabbed a rock from the floor. The machine smashed itself into the ground. The pilot looked smug in his alien cockpit before I smashed it open with the rock in hand. It shrieked and put its limbs above its head.

"Akja mo plee no--"

"Lampa noo de?" I said, climbing into the cockpit while yawning. I was completing its sentence, but I still had no idea what it meant. Probably something like 'spare me.' I smashed its head in with the rock as it looked at me, shocked. I learned long ago that if I spared it, it would spit acid at me immediately. I threw its body out the cockpit and took the seat for myself, preparing yet another rampage. I decided I'd go to the suburbs this time. 

"Onka no. Onka no," I heard from overhead. It sounded like a loudspeaker. It could have been an evacuation alarm, or the aliens trying to talk to me. Whatever it was, I was going for the rampage. I drove the mech to the houses and smashed each of its feet into different houses. Small aliens started running from most houses. Children presumably. I smashed each one into a pulp, humming a tune. I wonder if the things in the simulations remembered too. They seemed scared of me, but it's hard remembering a time they weren't afraid of me after learning how to pilot this thing. I pointed the guns at the neighborhoods in front of me and obliterated them. Must have been hundreds, dead. 

I grabbed a couple of the children's corpses from below me and threw them backwards, over my shoulder. By now, the flying war machines would be trying to stop me, but I would throw the deceased into their engines, destroying them as soon as they came on scene. After the initial carnage, I dropped the machine and climbed out.

I walked through the utter wreckage wrought by me. Any survivors on the brink of death were brought a swift one by my trusty rock. I made my way to the satellite tower in the center. Long ago, I believed it was the origin to all the simulations, but it also seemed to be indestructible. Nothing would take it down. I wasn't even sure it was my way out, it was just natural for me to gravitate toward it after my recurring murder sprees. 

As I reached the base of the tower, the world around me glitched and faded. I sighed and put my hands into my pockets. I looked up to the audience of aliens applauding me, as if I had done something they had never seen before. A few were cheering in their strange language while others booed and hissed at me. I leaned from one leg to the next, waiting for the council that sat on a panel below to start speaking. 

"Pompa. Ikta no," one said, solemnly. 

"I did this exact same thing, like three simulations ago! I killed just as many people and everything! Just let me go!"

One of the council members pantomimed bashing a rock into the alien next to it, then it shook its head at me. 

"I won't kill anyone if you just let me go! I got bored like 700 trials ago, just let me go!"

Another council member held up a small alien and patted it compassionately, looking at me as if to suggest I should try to do the same. 

"I already tried the pacifist route! I reset every time!! What do you want from me!? Please! Just let me go!"

The aliens nodded to one another, pretending to understand what I was saying. One in the center stood and said something slowly and benevolently.

"No!! No, no!! I swear I don't want any second chances, just let me--" 

The world spun around me and I was dropped in front of a giant war machine training its guns on me.

I shook my head in disbelief.

**Again.**
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________-

I gritted my teeth and jumped up. I looked to Boss who lifted a wing in a shrug. He had as many ideas as I did. I ran to the door as fast as I could.

"Martha! Wait, I'm--" I slipped and landed face-first on the slick mounds of bird poop. I gagged but shot back up to my feet. Luckily, the sound of my clumsiness had stopped Martha from opening the door. 

"Sean?" She sounded worried this time.

"I'm coming, I'm right here!" I said, slamming myself against the door when I slipped on the pile in front of the door. I unlocked it and opened the door a crack, just enough to stick my head out.

"Hey, Martha, everything is--" I stopped when I saw the look on her face. Her eyes first went wide and her nose shriveled in disgust. She took a step back and knelt over, keeping herself from throwing up. She heaved a few times, but nothing came out. Then, with a deep concern in her eyes said,

"What is that smell? It's like..." rather than place an adjective, she heaved once again. Finally, she was able to compose herself to look up and stare at me. It only brought more confusion in her eyes. 

"Sean, what..." I only realized what she was talking about when she peered closer at my face. It must have been covered in flecks of bird excrement. "What's on your face?" she asked, a mix of horror and shock in her voice. 

I racked my brain for an answer. Nothing jumped out as a reliable excuse, and I already knew it must have been suspicious that I was only poking my head out of the door. My eyes flitted to the stairs behind her, to her shoes, to a pair of crows flying just beyond the building. I decided the truth was the best way to get out of this. I gave her a weak, apologetic smile and answered. 

"I was just in the bathroom," I said meekly. Her eyes did the impossible and somehow grew wider. 

"Sean, your face is *covered* with..." she let the silence complete the sentence. 

"I'm going to go back inside and clean up," I said, sliding my head back through the door. She continued to watch, nonplussed. As soon as I closed the door, I listened through the door for what she would do next. It occurred to me that we never even discussed the noise complaint and that she would likely return. Instead, I heard her heave again and quickly run off. I sighed with relief, followed quickly by a frown. It would be hard to get rid of this reputation.

I made my way back to the bathroom. I began thoroughly soaking my face. Boss was chirping to Scar, who remained mostly silent except to agree with whatever Boss was saying in single, short tweets on occasion. Once cleaned and scrubbed to satisfaction, I went inside the bathtub and just sat down. It was the only clean place to sit. I leaned back, trying to relax, but unable to really grasp the events of today. 

Boss was a sparrow. No longer than my fist. But it seemed that on his order, he was able to stop thousands of birds from coming to attack me. Or him. Or both of us. Scar was the leader of the other group of birds, which meant he controlled thousands. But now Boss was lecturing Scar. Was there some kind of relationship there?

Boss looked to me and nodded. He warbled a bit and hopped off the bin holding Scar. Evidently, he wanted to go deal with something alone since he left without indicating I should follow. I looked up at the ceiling. 

"Some day, huh Scar?" I asked.

Scar tweeted something sarcastic.

Suddenly, there was a tap on my skylight. Perched on the window were two crows, both holding a trinket in their beaks. One a jewel of sorts while the other had a watch. I looked at them passively before I realized that they were probably here for me. Boss had probably called them. He wasn't kidding about paying me back! I got up giddily and stood atop the toilet to unlatch the window, opening it wide for them. The crows stepped for wary of stepping forward and just turned their heads to one side. 

"Come on in, I'm a friend," I offered. 

They dropped their trinkets and flew at my face, claws first.

______________________________________________________________I looked through the window of the door at my swap. I was inches from the door but didn't want to walk in. He hadn't realized I was there yet.

"I hear he's a swap," the nurse said next to me. 

"Yeah," I nodded, swallowing hard. 

"You can go in if you want. It's still visiting hours. Though, he's been visited a lot today, so he might be a little tired," she said. I didn't move, but she opened the door to go inside and he looked at me, his eyes widening in shock. 

"Oh my God," he said hoarsely, his voice a fraction of its usual, loud self. "You came?"

"Yeah," I whispered, finally walking in behind the nurse. She took a look at some of the things hooked up to his arm and nodded to herself, taking a few notes on the clipboard at the end of the bed.

"How are you feeling?" she asked.

"The usual," he said, wincing from an unknown pain. She nodded and took note of that as well. Then she looked up to me and said,

"He's all yours, I'll be back at nine with your pills, okay?" she said as she walked out the door. 

He blinked in acknowledgment, then focused on me. He tried to sit up but groaned in agony.

"Hey, don't get up on my part, I'm not worth it," I said quickly, putting my hands up. He chuckled. 

"You *sound* a lot like Aaron with the lack of self-worth. Do you feel like me too?" he said, smiling slyly.

"Aaron, you-- I-- you look awful," I said, walking up next to the bed. He looked at himself in mock surprise.

"I don't see an Aaron here. I'm Kurt," he said coughing in pain. 

"Aaron, how long has this been going on?" I said, gesturing to the bed and monitor next to him. This time he actually looked surprised.

"Did you not know you had cancer?" he asked sincerely, his voice almost reaching the level of normal conversation.

I wrung my hands.

"I felt awful the moment we swapped. But I couldn't find you with your resources. You were-- I am dirt poor. Not like I had a lot of free time to go find out what an Aaron Bixby was up to in my state," he ended his sentence with another fit of coughing. 

"I-- I'm sorry Aaron--"

"Kurt."

"Whatever! I'm sorry, I thought that I could... That I'd be able to outlast..." I let the silence speak. Aaron's eyes grew wide.

"You thought I would die before we switched back, didn't you?" he said, shocked. 

I looked out the window, not wanting to look at him.

"And now we're a day away from switching back only to find that you'll be worse off," he said to himself. 

I nodded slightly. 

"That sucks," he said plainly. I nodded again, watching birds fly outside the window.

"But you can let me die if you want, I don't really mind," he suggested. 

I looked back at him, nonplussed.

"What?"

"You can--" he began coughing violently. So much so that I thought he couldn't breathe. I got up to call a nurse but he waved me back. I stepped back furtively.

"You've seen my life Aaron," he began. "Not really the glamour it looks like from the outside. No cancer, sure, but also no friends and terrible family. I was-- am much happier as Kurt. You know I had over twenty friends visit me today? *Friends!*" He coughed again. " I didn't even *know* twenty people like Aaron. Did you get any more friends than I had?"

I shook my head, my mouth still opens in shock at his earlier suggestion.

"Yeah, it sucks to be alone," he whispered. His voice was getting fainter like each word sucked energy from him. Then he pointed a shaky finger at the IV bag next to him.

"You pull that out of me and I skip my pills and I guarantee I'm dead," he said suggestively.

"Aaron--"

"Kurt," he corrected.

"*Kurt.* I can't kill you," I said.

"Then you're dead," he looked like he tried to shrug but couldn't. He looked deep into my eyes. "I'm letting you do this. Better you continue to live in happiness in your life, than my misery to continue. I'll gladly go. But it's your choice," he said, laying back into his pillow and sliding his eyes closed. 

"Aaron-- Kurt, are you sure?" I asked.

"I'm completely fine with it. Just make the move and I'm with you," he said, his eyes still closed. 

"But... Aren't you afraid to die? I don't know what to do. I don't want to kill you, but I don't want to..." I realized he fell into a light sleep. I looked out the window again, then back to him. Today was my last day in this free body. But I'd have to murder my previous self to continue living in it.

I looked up to the IV bag. I swallowed hard. My heart hammered in my stomach as it lurched at my contemplating this decision. 

I looked back at the door. I could just leave and let the swap take its course. That was what I was supposed to do. It also would leave me with less of a guilty conscience. 

But was it better to have a guilty conscience or none at all?

I stared out the window one last time, then made my decision.___________________________________________________________________________

"Gah!" I screamed, grabbing the handle to close it before they got it. I was too slow to even close it halfway before they got in. The first crow scratched at my eye while the second dove past me. Scar tweeted loudly, cheering them on from his upturned prison. Shielding my eyes threw me off balance and I toppled to the floor hard, smashing my left arm on the edge of the tub and leaving my head swimming. The crow cawed a victory and flew into the other room. The first one was pulling at the bin, trying to tip it over again.

"Hey, don't do that, come on," I said slowly, my head taking its time gathering words to say in its pained state.

The crow succeeded in toppling the bin over and Scar shot up flying. He swooped a foot in front of me and tweeted arrogantly, pecking me in the forehead. I swatted at him with my hand too slowly and threw a shampoo bottle at the crow still in the bathroom with me. The three of us stopped and looked to the living room when we heard a scuffle coming from it. 

"Boss!" I cried, shielding my eyes and clambering up to go help him. My arm was on fire and I couldn't focus my sight, but Boss and the other crow were definitely fighting in the other room. Just as I got to the doorway, I heard the strangest screech I'd ever heard in my life. It was the cross of a rooster calling for the day to begin and a crow circling its prey. It was the sound of a crow who had been seriously wounded. I uncovered my eyes to see the second crow hopping on the floor weakly, still pining in pain. It looked up at me with one eye closed, it looked like a new and serious cut was left over it. Scar landed on my head and chirped twice, flying up and out of the skylight. The two other crows followed, the injured one cawing about something that sounded like it was probably revenge. It stayed in the bathroom a moment longer to make sure its point about revenge was heard. 

"Yeah, we got it, get out," I yelled, waving my arm at it. My wrist flared up in anguish. It was possible that it was sprained or broken form the fall. The crow angrily crowed but eventually left the bathroom. I hopped up on the toilet and slammed the window shut with my good hand before running into the living room. 

"Boss!!" I screamed. "Boss are you alright? That crow must have been huge to you! Where are you?"

I scrambled around the kitchen before seeing him standing proudly in the living room, his head high. In his mouth was a small, black, orb-like trinket. He didn't look like he was injured or otherwise distressed. 

"Everything okay, Boss?" 

He spat out the trinket. It was an eye. He looked up proudly, much like a cat does when it brings home a dead rat.

"Boss is that the crow's--"

Boss chirped affirmatively, beaming with joy. He hopped toward me and chirped, gesturing to my arm.

"I'm fine. Just a sprain... I think. The crows caught me by surprise and now I'm having a little trouble using it."

Boss chirped sympathetically, then nibbled at his bad wing. I chuckled. Then, he snapped to attention and chirped an order to me.

"Look, we gotta figure out like a system of communicating, I can only do so much with the tweets, Boss," I replied. 

He began to tweet, then stopped himself. He thought for a few seconds. Then just tweeted again.

"You're right, that was a stupid request, what do you need?" I said, kneeling down. 

Boss tweeted and hopped a few times, then pointed his head to the door, a determination in his eyes. 

We were going after Scar.

_____________________________________________________It was my best-kept secret. Everyone knew that I could summon pizza, but no one knew that I could change the form of something to be pizza if I wanted it to. I never had to eat bad food! Anything I disliked became pizza the moment before it made contact with my tongue. Of course, it brought out a lot of external consequences, too. I stood at the counter of the shelter as each of the patrons came by.

"Can I have vegetarian," an old, brittle woman asked. I nodded kindly and created her two slices. 

"Bless you for helping the homeless with your gifts," she said, sweetly, stepping away from the counter. 

"I want cheese. Just cheese. None o' that extra stuff on top. I used to get just cheese, me an' my ol' man, every Sunday when we went to the plaza on Seventh Street. You know the one?" Talkative Tom asked. I smiled and offered him his slices. "I tell ya', nothin' has been as good as the pizza from Seventh Street. Why I remember a time..." he continued talking, carrying on his story to someone else as he walked out of line. I don't know how he never missed a beat.

The next young man that approached me looked at me with awe. He was a newcomer and studied me with fascination as he stepped in front of me. He his larger friend next to him, who nodded and pulled out a baseball bat.

"We'll take you," he said, pulling a gun from the back of his pants and firing in the air.

I stood in shock as the three of us looked at each other. The shelter employees went around making sure all the homeless hit the deck and then followed suit. Everyone was on the ground except for Tom, who had started berating the two kidnappers. 

"I can't believe you would choose to use this wonderful mornin' on an escapade like this when you could be out havin' a blast with your ol' man out at a plaza or someplace, but you chose to try an' rob a buncha homeless people of their provider 'cause you aren'--"

"Shut up, gramps!" the man with the bat screamed, turning toward him. Tom grumbled to himself but didn't continue. 

"We just want the infinite food for our gang, alright Pizza Man?" the man with the gun announced. "We aren't gonna hurt you or any one of the old folk, so long as you come quietly."

I glared at the two of them, taking advantage of the homeless like this. Hostages. It made me sick. I raised my hands and walked slowly stepped out from behind the counter. 

"You don't have to listen to these hooligans cause they think they're tough with their weapons, why I'm sure we could jump them ourselves and take them down without even breaking--"

"I said, *shut up* gramps! One more time and I knock out this wonderful old lady," the man with the bat said, pointing his bat to the woman closest to him. Tom clamped his mouth shut, staring daggers into him.

The kidnappers guided me outside to a van that waited just beyond the front door. The man with the gun signaled for me to get in before they came in after me. It was just the three of us, then. This wouldn't be so bad. The man with the bat started the car and began driving while the man with the gun kept it trained on me.

"So, what kinda pizza can you make? I saw the veggie, can you do meats too? And pineapple?" the driver asked.

"No one's gonna eat pineapple pizza, Frank, that sounds disgusting," the gunman said, disgusted.

"Sucks for you, man, I love pineapple pizza. Probably better than any other pizza," he responded offended.

"*Fruit* does not belong on pizza!"

"Tomato's a fruit, and it's all over pizza."

"That's *not* the same--"

"What gang are you a part of?" I asked.

The two looked at each other for a moment.

"So you do speak," the gunman mocked. "You'll find out soon enough. They're excited to meet you."

"What if I'm gone before then? Would they get mad at you?" I asked.

"Please. What are you gonna do, throw--" the gunman cringed in shock as he realized that he wasn't holding a gun, but a slice of pizza. He looked at it in a daze, before he began yelling.

"Where did my gun go!?"

Frank slammed on the brakes, throwing me forward. He grabbed onto me by my neck, preparing to strangle me if need be. He looked up to his companion but saw that there was a slice of pizza hanging where the door used to be. His partner was ejected from the car while he slammed on the brakes. 

He panicked and began actually choking me. I struggled to pull him free, but he seemed intent on making me pass out before deciding what to do next. I closed my eyes and prepared for something I'd never done before, much less under this kind of strain.

I slid easily from his arms and he looked at them in horror. 

"Why... why are my hands pizza?" he whimpered. 

"Pineapple Pizza," I corrected, pointing to the yellow on his arm's slices of pizza. His face went white and he passed out from shock. I didn't know whether there was blood circulating in those arms, or if it was just sauce at this point. I wasn't going to stick around to find out.

I snuck out the van and walked back toward the shelter. I hadn't finished feeding everyone._________________________________________________________________________________________

I stared for a moment, waiting for the trick to over with. For them to start up the machine and disintegrate me in unbearable pain again. But it didn't happen.

"Is... Is it broken?" I yelled toward where the council normally was. No answer. I knelt down and grabbed my trusty rock. I don't know how else to start these simulations and it felt familiar to me at this point. I walked up to the war machine, gazing at its peak. 

"Hello?" I called hesitantly.

I walked between its legs and walked towards the tower in the center of this world. I hadn't tried in hundreds of resets, but I felt like I'd done something significant this time. I had to have access now. It was only a few blocks to the base of it.

Entering into the city, I came across a small group of them exiting a house hesitantly. The stayed close together, defending one another from my approaching.

"Ooklong?" the tallest one asked.

"Buddy, I've killed you before, and I'll do it again. I'm going to the tower. Get in my way and I'll destroy you and your little family. Again."

"Porba," it said, standing directly in my way. The others made their way surrounding me. 

"Ok, fine, I warned--" I stopped as an epiphany hit me like a train. There was only one thing I ever got one of them to respond to.

"Be free, you guys. Be free," I said, encouragingly. 

"Buh--" one of them stepped back, looking at its surroundings, "Be free?"

"Junkli be free, junkli!" the tall one said to me, accusingly. The others were already in a frenzy. One was tearing its arms off, yelling 'be free' affirmatively. Another was at the brink of exploding. 

The tall one watched as his companions all massacred themselves aggressively. It looked at me angrily. Then it turned to the tower. 

"Be free?" it asked, still watching the tower. 

"I still have no idea what you're saying, but come along if you want. It's either that or the rock," I said, walking past it. I didn't care if it attacked me from behind, I'd just reset at square one again. Either that or I just stopped caring about my life. Maybe they were equally true.

I made it past the next couple blocks without incident. At the last house before the tower, another one jumped in my way. 

"Be free," I said, noncommittally, hoping it would kill itself and I'd be done with it quick.

It stopped in place and started stomping on the floor below it. Then it had a mischievous look come upon its face and it ran into the house next to the one it came out of. I heard screams from inside. I shrugged and kept walking. 

I made it to the base of the tower. I touched it. I cringed, waiting for the simulation to power down, but I was still there. Dopamine fueled me, and I clambered up the stairs to the stop, running at max speed. I smacked my rock against the tower and whooped. I had finally made it. It felt like this was my life's purpose. 

At the top of the tower was a plain room without thousands of wires running through one box in the center and flowing out to the rest of the simulation. I looked around the room, trying to locate a switch, lever, or plug of some sort to power it down. I looked back to the box. I gripped my rock tightly, and smiled. Probably the last time I'd see it. 

I smacked the rock into the box. It began whining with a deafening sonic sound. I continued to smack it, as it continued to grow it volume. I screamed, but couldn't hear my voice over the noise, only the feeling of my vocal chords being used. I used both hands to smash it to pieces. I was blinded by the resulting explosion.

I didn't know what I did, but I began seeing things. I saw myself running the simulation. Each time more brutal than the last. There was a time I enjoyed it and then a later time I became bored. I continued to see more, including the other aliens that were in the simulation with me. Each of them, a horrible past. From theft, to murders, to cannibalism. Each one I interacted with was a criminal of some sort. I saw the war machine pilot from earlier committing a war crime in the same machine.

And then I saw the truth.

The simulation was the aliens' prison system. Anyone that had committed an egregious enough crime would be sent to this simulation forever. They could live their lives with each other. Whether they lived together at peace or at war was up to them. But there was a catch. The aliens were never made aware they were in a simulation. In fact, they had their memories wiped every time the simulation reset because this race of aliens could free themselves from the simulation if they knew they were in a simulation. I was placed in here for trespassing on an alien ship was seemed like years ago, and they believed that I was having my memory reset as well. The other aliens would watch us for sport. The ones I believed were council members would tell me about the crimes that the ones I killed had committed. One smashed another with a rock, just like I did. Another would groom little ones until they were old enough to eat. 

I could suddenly feel my body again, like I was being removed from the simulation, but not before being given the last bit of information.

The simulation was called a "Be Free" in the alien language. And reminding them of it gave them the ability to remember, and free themselves. 

I awoke laying down in a pod, my body aching all over, like I hadn't used it in days. The entire backside of my body burned like they had been seared off, and a quick sickening glance told me I was covered in bed sores. I groaned loudly, but had no energy to get up. I was completely spent. Reality was killing me. 

Outside of my pod, I heard pandemonium outside. The sound of war machines were prevalent, but I also heard the fearful scream of innocents and some crashing happening in rooms near mine. I closed my eyes and considered the fact that I had released every criminal in this alien world from the simulation, and they had collectively decided to start an apocalypse. I heard something approach my pod, and I opened my eyes to see an alien looking down on me in my exhausted and dying state.

I opened my mouth to try and say something, but my throat was completely dry and no noise came out. After looking at it a little longer, recognition came over me as I realized this was the pilot alien. It stared, clearly upset. It might have remembered the simulations as well as I, now. The countless number of times I killed it, sometimes with a smile on my face. I saw it slowly raise a rock up. 

I opened my mouth to try and ask it to stop, but I was again hindered by my sheer inability to do anything.

"Be free," it said, sending the rock down on my face.I looked out across the barren expanse, desolate except for the incomplete droids who had lined up in an orderly fashion in front of me. The one closest to me was missing an eye and standing about ten feet away, giving me a respectable amount of personal space from my tent which I hardly bothered setting up the night before. I didn't see it on any maps, so I assumed it uninhabited, but it must have been a planetary junkyard of sorts. They all looked like they'd been damaged or abused.

I rubbed the tire out of my eyes and grabbed a wrench.

"Come on over little guy, let's get you a new shiner," I said, spinning the wrench in my hand. It jumped for joy and ran to me. The rest of the droids simultaneously took a step forward sending a wave of sound rushing across the land before me. When the echo subsided, they stood and waited without a sound. It was a silent audience that stretched for miles. 

"Looks to me like your optical cord was severed?" I asked. The bot nodded quickly. It was covered in a sheen of red, like fresh rust and dirt-packed together. "I got one in my toolbox," I said, reaching down and popping it open ever so slightly. Most times, when droids saw spare parts, they went into a frenzy to try and get the piece they sought. This one hardly looked over when I opened the box. That was new.

I pulled out the piece from my tools and fit it into place in the open socket. The droid gave me a courteous nod and then rushed off to the side. The next droid stared at me. I nodded at it invitingly. It continued to stare.

"Uhh, next?"

The droid hobbled forward, limping on one leg. The rest of the bots took their simultaneous step forward, causing the booming echo once more. 

"You're missing a hipler cord, by the looks of it," I said, pulling one out of my supplies and tying it to the open wires. It also had the same rust spots but in a different area. Looked more like splotches of liquid. Oil maybe? It nodded courteously and ran off in the same direction as the first. I followed it with my eyes. The first droid was already at the horizon, running with determination. 

"Next!" It walked forward and pointed to its chest. 

"No energy core, huh? Those aren't as easy to come by..." I said apologetically. It slumped down dejectedly. I put my hand on its shoulder. 

"Tell you what, I can get one off my ship. Don't tell any of your friends about it though, all right?" 

The robot nodded excitedly. I walked over to my ship and the other bots watched patiently. Except for the creak of a few of their necks and the sound of my feet, it was eerily silent. I looked out to them for a moment before entering my ship. They were uncharacteristically well-behaved. Disciplined, even. They weren't like my regular customers, but I was happy to help them regardless. 

I grabbed the part and returned to the bot, placing it in place and sending it on its way, running the same direction as the first two. 

The next one was missing an arm. I fashioned one out of the extraneous pieces of my ship's wings.

The next one a leg. The next another core. 

An eye. A limb. Chest armor. A functional audio container.

I slowly took my ship apart to accommodate each of the bots' missing components. Before I could even register it, I no longer had an engine. Nor a communicator. Not even a distress beacon. Everything was torn down to give to these poor droids who had such a hard time on this junkyard planet.

"I don't have enough to replace the whole head plate, but I can cover your optical cord if that's agreeable to you?" I said to the latest one. It nodded graciously when I heard another sound over the horizon. Someone running toward me. A human!

"You mind?" I said to the bot, who nodded and took a few steps back to give me my space. 

The shape turned out to be a man, his right arm soaked in blood. Too much for it to be his own. He was shouting at me, screaming and flailing his arms as much as he could. I waved him over to me. He looked incredulous and waved for me to go to him. I sighed and turned back to the bot.

"Be right back, all right?" I said, walking away. I felt the thousands of eyes follow me to this new man. When I finally reached him, he grabbed and my shirt and hissed,

"Are you out of your mind? What are you doing hanging around war droids!?" He reeked of fear.

"It is of no consequence what kind of bot they used to be, I serve all homeless and retired droids to get them back on their feet. Literally speaking," I chuckled.

"Used to-- retired? These bots just came and killed my village not an hour ago! For every one we took down, another came after it! An endless horde! I thought we'd defeated them last we fought, but they must have a repair factory or..." his eyes focused on me, his breathing slowing down for a moment.

"You said you fix them?" He gripped my shirt tighter.

"I..." Sweat rolled down my neck. I slowly hid the hand holding my wrench behind my back. "I try to help all the home--"

"You fool! You deranged fool! You killed my family! You-- you killed--" his eyes went wide and his head whipped around behind him. A small group of bots was marching our way, with all the discipline they'd displayed when I repaired them. 

"No!!" the man yelled, kicking my shin and throwing me their way. He ran off, perpendicular to the line of bots and the marching bots. I grabbed my leg in pain and tried to get up. I immediately collapsed, filled with grief. I was supposed to help the galaxy, not continue its suffering. I tried to get up again, but couldn't find any strength in me. I waited to be executed by the coming battalion. I heard their strong steps approach me until they were right on top of me. I looked up to face my death.

They looked at me and nodded courteously and simultaneously, continuing their march toward the man who ran away. I stared, dumbfounded. I looked back to the line who hadn't moved an inch from where they stood except to keep their eyes on me. We held a staring contest for a few minutes while my thoughts came in order. 

Finally, I spat and stood up.

"I was always in it for bots' happiness anyway," I said, heading back to my next patient.It could have been anything metal, it didn't have to be a stethoscope. Could have been something more innocuous like a knife, a metal bat, a pipe or something. Just not a stethoscope. Anything but that.

"Be sure to drink plenty of fluids," I heard mumbled aimlessly outside. 

My heart dropped. It really was a doctor. I held a hand over my mouth to cover my breathing and began to walk away from the front door while he still didn't notice me. I only made it two steps before the floorboard creaked under my weight. I cringed and froze, hoping the creature outside didn't notice. For a fleeting moment, there was no noise outside. Then, its voice was closer to the door. 

"I can't give you antibiotics for a viral infection," he whispered into the keyhole. It was all I could do to keep myself from screaming in fear. I heard the door handle begin to jiggle as he attempted to make his way in. I looked around the room for somewhere to hide. It was only a matter of time before he found some way to open that door when there were no apples in the window. I ran into the kitchen, making way too much noise on the way there. The door shook with more intensity. 

It clicked as the lock somehow came open. 

"Do you smoke?" he asked into the empty living room. I rocked back and forth next to the fruit basket. It seemed like every other kind of fruit was available like bananas, pears, oranges, you name it. But no apples. I shook uncontrollably as I heard him make his way around the room. He was slapping his stethoscope on everything in the room, checking for a pulse. The floorboards creaked under him. He was coming this way.

I grabbed the fruit basket and scampered behind the counter as quietly as I could. I started pulling all the fruits out, hoping that maybe the remnant of the smell of apples would be enough to hold him off. But I had never heard of them being afraid of the smell, only being touched by them.

"Just what the doctor ordered!" he chuckled to himself, just outside the kitchen. I saw him in the reflection of the window. He was wearing a white coat, had the stethoscope to his ears and was looking around the kitchen furtively. He must have thought this was the most likely place that apples would be found. He took a step forward hesitantly. Then another one more confidently.

He rounded the corner and looked at me curled up on the floor. A wide smile stretched across his face.

"Take a deep breath and hold it!!" he cackled. 

I screamed and threw the empty basket at him. It bounced off of him harmlessly and he stomped forward, laughing and holding up his stethoscope. I crawled backward and screamed again. I grabbed the nearest thing to me and held it out defensively in front of me. 

He roared in anger, stomping his feet defiantly. With rage in his eyes, he turned around and marched out of the kitchen. He remained in the living room for a few seconds then left the house. I let out a breath I didn't realize I was holding and looked at the thing I was holding. It was a pear, but partially obscured by the rest of my hand it kind of looked like the bottom of a green apple. I stared at it in a daze.

I stood up hesitantly and went back to the living room to see if I could still see him from the window or if he had truly run off. Before I could make it, I saw a note on the table. I picked it up and saw it was a prescription slip with scribbles on it. After scrutinizing it for what may have been a minute, I realized that he had written something and the scribbles were just his handwriting. Scrutinizing it further, I figured out what it was.

A prescription for death.I swept across the room, searching for any form of life. I was really upset by the fact no one was there to listen to my opening statement, much less cower in fear. I landed back in the center of the circle and thought about the situation. No summoner meant no order. No order meant no contract. No contract to complete meant no way of being sent back to my realm.

I frowned. There was good to come of this, right?

Well, I wasn't shackled down by any contracts. That was a plus. Also, there was nothing holding me back from causing injury to the first person who gave me an order. Usually, that was off-limits. But... I was directionless. This may have been the first time I had no idea what to do. I had no purpose. 

I frowned further. 

"Ah!" someone fell to the ground at the far entrance of the summoning chamber. It was a young boy, very recently reaching manhood. He was holding various items held by those that killed cultists. Ah, he was an errand boy. I warped in front of him eagerly.

"Don't eat me!!" he screamed, throwing the articles in his hand at me. They phased through me harmlessly while I pondered on his order.

"Is that what I'm supposed to do? Eat people?" I asked.

"What?" he whimpered.

"I feel like I should be doing... something! I'm not used to this," I said, floating through him. He shivered and looked back at me, fear frozen onto his face.

"Were you summoned by the Frenzites?" he asked quietly.

I warped back in front of him, a hunger in my eyes. He screamed again, evidently assuming my hunger was physical and not one of knowledge.

"Who were the Frenzites?" I asked quickly.

"The people who are..." he looked up and pointed a shaky hand at all the dead bodies.

"No, no, I mean what were their goals? What did they want?" I asked urgently. It was like an itch I couldn't scratch. A demon without orders. 

"I don't understand. They wanted to summon you," he said, his voice quavering.

"NO!" I said, my eyes going ablaze in flames. "What did they look to achieve? Their aspirations for this world!?"

"I-- I don't--" he began blubbering inconsolably. He pointed again at the dead bodies. Then back to me.

"No, I--" I sighed, placing a calming hand on his shoulder. His sobbing slowed down considerably, though he was thoroughly confused. "I'm going to enter your mind to get some answers okay? It might drive you to insanity, but I just might go insane if I don't figure out what I'm doing here, okay?" I asked, sincerely.

"Wait, what--" 

I jumped into his mind and combed over his memories. His victories at chess. His failures at horseback riding. The pride he felt at joining a squadron to stop the Frenzites from summoning a demon that would-- The memories stopped. I jumped back out to see he had fallen unconscious. Whether he was dead or just passed out I didn't care to know. He had shown me a town that he was meeting in with his squadron that was only a little ways from here. Perhaps the man that gave them the quest would know the answer. 

I left the summoning chamber with a drive, a motivation I would stop at nothing to reach. To find a purpose.Whenever I was finished with killing someone, the people around me would act in the oddest way. Reality itself would fold the pages across the life of whoever I killed, so people who knew the deceased kind of skipped over or forgot complete portions of their life. But no one would acknowledge *me*. The blood on my body was gone. No one would even wonder why I came out of the forest with a machete in hand. The death of these people was business as usual since their death never happened. It was like a parallel world came to be in the moment I removed a body from sight.

I reached a boiling point. I tested the lengths of this ability to its fullest and was currently carrying out my latest plan.

"So," Graves said, the grizzled man who decided he was too good for sleeves, "what are *you* in for?"

"I killed the warden's mom," I said, picking at my teeth with a dull spoon since they wouldn't give me anything sharper.

"What?? That was you? You know he's at her funeral right now. So, you the one getting the chair, then?"

"Hasn't been decided yet. I haven't been to court yet. That doesn't matter, though. I'll be out of here by the end of the day," I said confidently, dropping the spoon onto my tray and getting up to return it.

"Hey!" Graves got up quickly to catch up. He lowered his voice and came in close, but acted like nothing out of the ordinary was going on. "If you have some kind of escape plan, you better let me in on it, otherwise I'm ratting before you get the chance."

"No plan. Well, kind of. But if I tell you, it's not like it will help you. It's a plan that involves complete exoneration without doing anything," I said.

"Ah, rich lawyer friends?"

"Just me," I smiled.

"Just-- Buddy, you killed the Warden's mom! You know how much he cared about her?"

"Yeah, actually, that's why I killed her. Wanted to see how bad I could go and still get away with it. He knows I killed her. And you know I killed her. Right?"

"Uhhh.. right?" he said quizzically.

"That means she hasn't been buried yet," I said, dropping the play on the return counter and walking back to our table.

"What does burial have to do with it? Some kind of rig?"

"No, just that everyone forgets what I did immediately after the body is disposed of. But this time I want to see how much people will forget. Quick, tell me why I'm in the slammer!" I said, looking him square in the eyes, a sneer on my face.

"You, uhhh... killed the Warden's mother," he said, growing more confused.

"And you're not gonna forget that?" I asked, urgently.

"Yeah, why would I forget that? I think I get that you're insane, buddy. Not many people I meet in here are actually insane, but you're the real deal. Straight wacko," he said, with equal levels of disgust and respect.

We sat back down and waited to be dismissed to our cells for a couple of silent minutes. I saw a couple of people point to me and whisper to one another conspiratorily. I relished the attention while I could. I knew it wouldn't last.

"Hey, all," an officer at the front announced, bored. "You're all free to go to your cells. Except you," he said, pointing at me. He shook his head and closed his eyes like something was on his mind and he wanted to get it out of his head. He looked back up to me confused. He motioned for me to come over again. I had the feeling he forgot my murder. The burial must have finished.

"Quick, Graves! What am I in for?" I said quickly. Graves looked at me with a faraway stare, like I was someone he'd once seen in a dream but didn't expect to meet in reality.

"You're uhh... You're a crazy guy? Did something crazy?" he asked. He shrugged, having lost interest in the conversation.

"No! I killed someone! Who did I kill!?" I said, feeling the information being sucked out of him.

"I dunno that you killed anyone. I feel like I'd remember that, buddy. Look, go be crazy with the guard, I'm gonna go take a nap," he said, turning his back to me. I looked at him in despair and ran to the officer who was still calling me over.

"Yes? What is it? Have they reached a verdict on my case?" I asked urgently.

"Yeah, it looks like we'll be done with you a lot sooner than expected," he said, grabbing me by the shoulder to lead me away.

"The electric chair already?" I said, a mix of fear and excitement in me. 

"Ha! No, you're free to go. There wasn't a shred of evidence for you having to be here," he said excitedly. He sounded like he was happy for me. Only I was miserable.

"I want to talk to the Warden!" I said adamantly.

"Yeah, I suppose you'll want to tell him off after getting put in here for no reason. Stay here, he was at a funeral today and he'll be back soon," he said, opening an arm out to a quaint waiting room. My clothes and belongings were waiting for me on a table.

"The funeral!" I jumped. "Whose funeral was it?"

He opened his mouth only to find no answer like he was sure he knew, but couldn't get it off the tip of his tongue. He took a moment longer to think it over, then shrugged.

"Beats me."

I changed quickly. I slammed myself down into a chair and bit each of my nails down into a nub, waiting for the Warden to come back to the prison. A while later, he burst through the door looking agitated.

"Warden!" I said, leaping to get in his way.

"Yeah, what is it, son? Oh, you're the one I got in by mistake. Sorry about that son, but I don't choose who comes in, I just house the inmates," he said apologetically, trying to get past me. I stepped in his way again.

"How was your day? How was the funeral?" I pushed.

"Look, son, I've had a lousy day, wasting it at some community member's funeral. Didn't even know the woman. Might as well have not existed. I'm not exactly in the best mood after wasting so much of my day," he said, attempting to weave past me again. I moved in front again.

"Then one last thing I want to know, and I'll leave you alone," I said. He grunted impatiently but let me continue.

"Can you tell me anything about your mother? Something, anything to describe her? The woman who brought you into this life and raised you?" I asked, sweating at this point.

His body language changed. He went into deep thought, his eyebrows swimming into a dozen different expressions as he ran through all the memories in his mind. He shook his head a few times, narrowing down on the idea of his mother.

"You know, not once in my life have I thought about her before," he sighed. My jaw went slack. He thought for only a moment longer before shrugging and saying, 

"You know, maybe I didn't have one!"Death continued stroking his chin, floating back and forth akin to something that might be considered pacing if snakes weren't constantly falling out of his cloak and disintegrating on contact with the ground.

"What about like, you can't die by food poi-- no, that just doesn't..." he floated away again, banging the staff end of his scythe on the floor in frustration.

"Excuse me, um, Mr. Death?" I asked, moving the covers I was hiding behind a fraction of an inch.

He stopped in place, waiting. Even the snakes stopped falling out.

"Why is it that I have to be given powers?" 

"Ah, that's the thing with the undead. When you come back to life, you can't be in the same form you were, otherwise people will know you didn't actually die. The supernatural really sells it."

"But I *didn't* die," I stressed, patting my chest.

"Really, though?" he asked, squinting his eyes, unconvinced. "I saw the blood on your bed, and even the teeth left behind in the room. Heck, your body was there, smoldered by the fire in your room," he looked up in thought while a cockroach skittered from his eye to his ear.

"Yes, that was all planted evidence so my father's ad--"

"Yes, yes, your advisor killed you, I'm working around the idea that you didn't actually die. Quite the--"

"But I was never in danger of dying!" I yelled. He turned to actually look at me, looking deep into my eyes and pulling the truth with his gaze. I saw understanding come into his eyes and I finally got the feeling we were on the same page.

"You no longer feel fire on your flesh!" he said excitedly, a cobra falling from his sleeve as he waved it triumphantly.

"What?"

"You were burned to death! It'll be an irony to show that even though they tried to burn you, you are completely fine. Oh, that's excellent. Undead are normally pretty affected by fire, since the brain burns nicely. I like that distinction, don't you?" he asked, not looking at me.

"But I wasn't bur--"

"Oh, I can't wait to see the look on King Ravier's face when he sees that you're still alive and ready to take back the throne. He'd have to be your advisor again! Or.." he looked longingly at his scythe and swished it in the air excitedly.

"Please, you must understand, I'm in hiding to get control of my life once again. I don't want to go back and confront Ravier once more. I'm happy to live my days here," I made a gesture to my quaint hobble.

He looked at me with sympathy. 

"I know you're scared--"

"You're clearly not listening," I said as he floated toward me.

"But you are impervious to flames now. And I'll imbue you with bravery," he said, tapping my forehead with the blade of his scythe. My body felt completely invigorated, like I was ready to challenge anything. Even death itself. I stood up to really tell him off now. As soon as I opened my mouth, Death looked excited and snapped his fingers. 

The world spun around me and the only thing that anchored me was what I was going to say. Despite not being on solid footing, I began screaming out at Death, telling him exactly how I felt,

"Try as you might, I won't become your pawn! Just let me live you crazed lunatic!" My vision came under control and I saw myself standing before the throne, former advisor Ravier with a crown on his head looking at me in complete shock with his court soldiers on the ground, screaming in fear. Behind him was Death, floating with a jovial thumbs up and his scythe at the ready. It took me a moment longer to see what the soldiers were continuing to scream about. My body was set on fire, a flame crown forming on my head.

I sighed.

"Just give me the throne so I can be done with this?" I asked Ravier. 

He yelped and collapsed out of the chair, face first. He sputtered what was supposed to be an apology and scampered out of the room. I rubbed my temples and went to sit on the throne while Death looked at me with an expectancy like dog waiting for a stick to be thrown.

"Fine, and execute him too," I ordered the guards. They screamed in unison and chased after their failed king, Death flying frantically behind them. 

I looked at my empty throne room and felt its expansiveness spread out before me. It was lonely and its silence was deafening. As the flames starved themselves out on my body, I thought of what to do in this new position, which was likely worse off than I was three minutes ago."Prrow?" Whiskers meowed thoughtfully, asking me what was going on.

I was hyperventilating into my overhead oxygen mask as the woman next to me screamed into hers. The captain had stopped relaying what was happening after he announced that multiple engines had given up on the plane. He was desperately trying to level the plane as we descended at faster speeds, approaching a nosedive.

"Mmmmrow?" Whiskers nodded, hopping out the top on the overhead compartment, my backpack falling after her. She looked back at me and then gestured forward with her head. She walked toward the bathroom. 

"I... Whiskers I can't! If I take off the oxygen mask I might--"

"AAAHHHHHHHHHH," the woman screamed next to me, pointing to the window. The ground was now visible and approaching us recklessly. 

Whiskers looked at me, whipped her tail, and walked to the bathroom door, waiting patiently in front of it. 

My body shook viciously from the adrenaline and fear. My head whipped to look out the window, and then back to Whiskers. 

"Gah, fine!" I screamed, tearing off my mask and running down the aisle. I passed by many more panicking passengers. Some hunched over praying, others screaming at the top of their lungs, and some quietly awaiting for the inevitable. They stared straight ahead, like they could see death approaching. I was just about to make it to the bathroom when a flight attendant pretty much collapsed in front of me, slamming his face into the door to get in my way.

"You need to get back to your seat, *now!*" he ordered, putting his arms up as if to carry me there himself.

"You don't understand! Whiskers is here which means I have to follow the cat for safety!" I stammered, pointing at her in front of the bathroom. The steward didn't even turn his head. 

"I know it's scary, but you have to go back. It's the safest place to be right now and you are.." his voice trailed as he stared out the window behind me. We were level with mountains and still descending at a steep angle. We probably had seconds to spare. 

He mechanically turned and sat in his seat, putting his seat belt on. He looked at me regretfully, ashamed that he didn't try harder to save my life, but valuing his own in the face of my apparent negligence of safety and common sense. 

"Maow!!" Whiskers called to me. 

I smashed the door open and closed the door behind me. I stood in the cramped space, not knowing what to do as Whiskers jumped up to the counter next to me. She tapped a paw on the sink. I went to pet her and she scratched at me, hissing. She pawed the sink again.

"I'm--" I gasped involuntarily, trying to get a grasp of myself, "I'm supposed to turn it on?"

She looked at me expectantly. I obeyed the order, and watched her dip a paw in the running water. Then she licked the droplets from her paw. My heart dropped. This wasn't meant for anything, she was just thirsty.

*So, this is how I die.*

The plane smashed into something outside and tore a huge hole in the walls of the bathroom. My eyes started pouring tears in fear as I was sucked out the opening and thrown out the plane. I screamed the whole way down, but didn't die on impact. It hurt for sure, but I was in the middle of water. It took me about ten seconds to understand which way was up, and I swam as fast as I could. 

I was in a lake, near the shore. From what I could tell from the destroyed terrain, the plane hit a rock jutting out the mountain next to the lake, and I was the only one to be sucked out into the lake. Whiskers was miraculously on the shore, watching me with her deep, intelligent eyes. I couldn't see any other bodies around me. I think the hole I came through was only as big as the bathroom was. 

Suddenly, I heard a colossal explosion from behind me. I spun around in the water to see shrapnel from the plane flying in all directions around it. The whole thing had exploded on landing. I looked for another few seconds in pure shock before pulling myself to shore. Whiskers stood just out of arms reach, leaving me unable to pet her.

"Th... Thanks," I said, feeling stupid talking to her. 

She turned around, uninterested and disappeared up the mountain. I wouldn't see her until my next traumatic experience."Brains," Gerald groaned, aimlessly stumbling forward in the field. Alpha-1 looked to the other bots.

"*Prime directive has made a request*," it said, expecting a response. The others looked to one another.

"*The request was unclear, Alpha-1. I am unable to discern the nature of the request. Are we certain it wasn't a musing of the prime directive?*" Beta-3 asked from above, looking at the perimeter for things that may try to hurt Gerald.

"Brains," he continued. The androids looked to one another worriedly.

"*Theta-1, are there any life forms in the vicinity?*" Alpha-1 asked pointedly to the android guarding Gerald's rear. Theta-1 began scanning the environment and beeped. 

"*There is a rabbit to the East!*" Theta-1 responded dutifully, "*and a pack of humans hiding from us in the building at the top of the hill*," he said as little more than an afterthought. The bots marched in silence for a few seconds more, waiting for one of them to make the first suggestion.

"Brains?" Gerald asked.

"*Beta-3, bring us the rabbit,*" ordered Alpha-1. Beta-3 flew out of sight in an instant. The androids marched in awkward silence for a few seconds. Gerald's stomach growled. Alpha-1 looked to Theta-1 for suggestions. It offered none. 

Suddenly there was a loud bang from the shack up ahead and the sound of a loud scuffle.

"Brains?" Gerald said excitedly, changing from a stumble to an excided lurch in the direction of the worn-down building. Beta-3 ran back to its companions and put a struggling rabbit under Gerald's nose.

"*I have retrieved the Brains for you. Have we fulfilled the request?*" it asked nervously. Gerald shoved it away, uninterested and continued his trek up the hill.

"*He has discovered the humans up ahead*," Alpha-1 said plainly. 

"*Oh no*," Beta-3 said, worriedly. It looked at the rabbit uneasily, then shoved its hand into its head and cleanly pulled out its brain in one motion. He tossed the carcass aside and placed the small brain under Gerald's nose again.

"*Perhaps I was unclear earlier. I have a brain for you right here,*" Beta-3 said quickly. Gerald slowed for the slightest moment at the sight of the brain. He gave it some time, scrutinizing it. 

"*Yes, that is it Prime Directive. It is a fresh brain,*" Beta-3 said. The other two bots watched, motionless. Gerald's hand twitched and reached up--

"Bradley no!" A woman's shout came from up above, immediately breaking Gerald's focus. A bullet ricocheted off of Alpha-1. Gerald began freely salivating and moved as fast as his walk could take him up the hill. 

"*A threat has been made upon Prime Directive's life*," Alpha-1 said begrudgingly.

Beta-3 did the robotic equivalent of a frown as he swapped his arms for heavy weaponry and marched up the hill. 

"No! No!" came shouting from a man as the sound of more bullets ricocheting off of Beta-3 came down to the three marching up the hill. 

"*Do you think this will satiate Prime Directive's hunger this time?*" Theta-1 asked. 

The sound of dozens of bullets took the space of a reply for Theta-1. Followed by the crying out of two humans in immense pain.

"Brains!" Gerald said, finally seeing the two humans with his own eyes and climbing in through the window to eat. He crawled on all fours to one and began eating her gleefully while the other watched and screamed in horror, his legs unable to move as they'd been shot.

"Please! Manual override! Look at it, it's a zombie! Please help me! I'm still alive, this guy's dead and **eating my wife!**" the human cried out in a mix of pain and desperation.

"*Prime directive is not dead*," Alpha-1 said watching Gerald. It could not look at the man in his state. 

"Then kill me! Don't let-- NO!! PLEASE!!" he screamed as his wife reanimated and the two of them crawled their way over to the man. The three bots watched as the two creatures made the third one of their own. Gerald stood up again, not a scratch on his body other than the original bite mark on his shoulder. The other two were barely holding together and using their arms alone to move around. 

Gerald turned his head to the two and flicked his head forward,

"Brains!" he said as a command. The other two fell in line, crawling behind him with gusto.

"*It seems Prime Directive has taken ownership of these two*," Theta-1 said, surprised as the six of them made their way out of the building and went aimlessly in another direction.

Alpha-1 marched beside them, considering the situation.

"*They may do well in protecting Prime Directive. We shall protect them as well so long as it does not hinder our ability to safeguard Prime Directive*," it decided.

The other two bots looked to it in surprise for a moment, then nodded in agreement.

"Brains," said Gerald, leading his army to the next city."Greetings, summoner, I hope you--"

"*Shhh!*" I hissed, looking outside the conference room. "I'm at work."

"Ah, so you'd like me to inflict a curse on someone here?" the demon whispered. Even in his whispering, it felt like his voice was exploding like a fire roaring in a dry forest.

I ignored the question, quickly closing the blinds to the windows looking into the room. The room was booked for a meeting in less than ten minutes, so I didn't have much time.

"I need your help," I began.

"Naturally," he said, his voice slithering down my neck like a snake on water. "To whom?"

"Debra, the one from accounting, I'm getting absolutely sick of her," I said, shakily. I was anxious to share my feeling out loud, but it was also exhilarating.

"Yes, I can sense her. The one a few desks down, hmm?" 

"Yeah, I wanna put her in her place. Really show her, you know?"

"I dooo..." he said slowly, a gleam in his eyes. He pulled out a mace and rake from nowhere and pointed in her direction.

"You know the price, yes? I get control of your body for as long as the task I'm given lasts. Do you agree to the terms?" he asked, his hand rearing up to break down the door.

"Whoa, wait, don't hurt her!" I said rapidly.

"Hmm?"

"I want you to... talk to her. Tell her to stop eating the food in my fridge," I said confidently. The look the demon gave me sucked that confidence out in a moment.

"What?" he said, unsure whether he heard me right or if I misunderstood what demon's strengths were.

"Yeah, we have a company fridge and we all put food in there, and my name is always on my food, but she eats it anyway!" I whined.

"Don't... You have a boss for this, don't you? Or Human Resources?" he asked slowly. I think he saw I was on the brink of tears.

"Yeah, but he doesn't care about this stuff, and HR is close friends with Debra, so they don't even give her a slap on the wrist," I complained.

"And..." he let the silence hang while he gathered the rest of the sentence. "You want me to... talk? Just go to her and tell her off about eating the food?" 

"Oh, I don't know if you have to tell her off, just like, tell her to stop or..." my voice trailed, not completing the sentence. My eyes fell to the floor, embarrassed. 
 
"Have you told her this yourself?" the demon asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

I mumbled under my breath.

"Have you??" he insisted.

"I don't like confrontation," I said, loud enough for him to hear. "Nevermind, this was a stupid idea, it's not that big a deal that she's eating my Tupperware, I guess," I said, looking up and readying myself to send him back to the demonic realm.

"Hold on, she's eating clearly labeled Tupperware that isn't hers and filled with your leftover food?"

"Actually, it's my meal prep," I corrected.

"What!? And she just gets away with this?" Steam began floating off of his forehead and he began breathing deeper.

"Yeah, I guess," I said, eyes on the floor again. His eyes bulged wider and he began snapping his jaws angrily, speaking himself into a frenzy.

"Well, that's ridiculous! You put time and effort into that! That's a lot of effort over the weekend to keep yourself from purchasing food over the course of the week! I-- I'm gonna give her a piece of my mind!" he boomed, smashing himself through the wall. 

I peeked out from the hole as my colleagues all screamed and pointed at my demon. He deliberately made his way straight to Debra's desk and breathed deeply. I smiled involuntarily, happy that someone would finally get her off my food. 

"How would you like to see all your hard work get eaten!?" he roared. His voice was truly demonic now, ringing in my ears even as I felt it shiver my bones. He opened his jaws wide, which split into a wide void and consumed her whole, her desk included. He was still fuming with rage when he looked back at me and gave me a thumbs up.

"This one's on me," he said, warping out of existence. 

I stared, nonplussed as to whether I should be happy for not having to deal with Debra or having caused all of this ruckus without asking my boss first.**#9173 in queue**

The floated on the floor as freely as it floated in my mind whenever I closed my eyes. How far was that? It'd been that way for years. Centuries, even. We thought the number would go down, but evidently the number was just an id number, not an indication of how many there were left to go. We'd even forgotten why we summoned it. But we always gathered on the anniversary to the same location we started from.

"300th anniversary, huh?" said Jim, squatting in front of the number and tapping it.

"Yes," I nodded solemnly. 

"Remember back in year 182 when Frank got lost in the ocean?" asked Ken.

Frank blushed a little bit, nodding his head. 

"We actually thought you managed to die," I admitted.

Frank shrugged, his vocal cords too far gone from his time in the sea. We never learned what happened exactly. When we found him, decades later, we tried to get him to write it out, but he was far too traumatized to talk about it. All he wrote was "Jellyfish," and shuddered too much to continue.

"So we're all in agreement to try a new incantation, even after we agreed to never do anything of the sort after the first attempt?" I asked seriously, holding up a folded paper containing an incantation.

"Yeah, let's do it," Jim said.

"I'm ready," agreed Ken. Frank gave us a thumbs up and nodded his head.

"Very well. Reading this will tell us how long until the demon is summoned. This will not decrease the time at all, as that power does not exist, but it will tell us how much longer we must remain waiting for it to come," I explained. My friends nodded, having had this explained before. I held up the paper to unfold and they came around me.

Jim, Ken and I read it simultaneously while Frank nodded along. It took about thirty seconds to read and when we finished a bright light took over the room we stood. It was as dazzling as it was blinding and my companions shielded their eyes while I looked upon it daringly. I would be willing to take the risk to see how much longer it would take. 

It burned my eyes as the light dwindled down into a rectangle, a page in the air with writing on it. Finally, an answer! I ran over to the page eagerly and blinked the pain away from my eyes. 

"What does it say?" Jim asked, his eyes still shut tight. 

"It..." I swallowed hard, "it says #1023 in magic queue," I announced.

Silence enveloped the room as we let it sink in. We'd have to wait for this number as well. I shook with anger at myself, not having considered that this would be the result of our actions. 

"No," said Jim, opening his eyes to confirm.

Ken opened his mouth to say something when another bright light flashed from our original number. We stared at it in awe, as it was the first time we'd seen it do anything other than float above the ground. It began an orb, then a humanoid figure with wings. 

When the light faded, a bored, fat demon sat in the spot where the paper had been.

 "'Sup?" the demon asked, flicking his head up. His wings were flapping, but he was too large to be carried off the ground.

"You're--" Ken began, but let the silence complete the thought. It was what we had been waiting for this past 300 years.

"Look like you dudes wanted to know the lottery numbers for the day after you summoned me?" the demon asked, consulting a parchment that had appeared in front of him.

"No, we're over that man, we're just ready to die!" Jim interjected. The demon looked up and breathed out amused.

"No, it says right here you want lottery numbers," he said. His fingers moved quickly, but rather than producing a snapping sound, they came together with a fart. A paper appeared in front of me, landing on the floor with a few lottery numbers from a now nonexistent lottery from centuries ago. The demon looked around the room and stopped at the sight of the remaining floating paper with #1023 on it. He breathed through his teeth.

"Sucks for you guys, that won't be done for a while," he said without sympathy.

"How long!?" I screamed as it disappeared with another fart. I slammed my hand against the floor in fury. We might have to be here for another three hundred years before another useless incantation was complete.

"What do we do now?" Jim asked. 

"We'll think of something," I lied. "Ken, it's your turn to come up with an idea," I said looking to him.

Ken was staring at nothing his mouth agape. I looked to the spot then back to him, confused.

"What is it, Ken?" I asked.

"Frank," he answered, pointing to the spot where Frank had been standing a moment ago. I blinked as I understood his meaning. Frank had disappeared with the demon.

"Do you think the demon took him?" Jim asked.

I shivered as I thought of Frank going through more trauma. Then another thought came to mind,

"No, he didn't make the second incantation, so he had nothing to wait for," I surmised.

Ken's mouth fell open wider and Jim's eyes went into wide open shock. We'd delayed ourselves for not being patient for only a few more minutes. My eyes brimmed with tears. 

I only wished to die.______________________________________________________

I looked around my ruined apartment, then felt my injured arm, glanced at the broken window, and finally landed on Boss.

"Do... Do I have to go with you, Boss?" I asked slowly. The pain in his eyes was immediate enough to make me look away. I grabbed at my bad arm nervously. 

Boss tweeted questionably. 

"It's just..." I weighed my words carefully, not wanting to address the issue. Even his little tweet did a blow to my composure. "Look, this isn't my place. This is a bird thing, right? I mean, I've just been getting in your way. Holding you back, even," I said pathetically.

He tweeted indignantly. Then he warbled loudly. He cried out and hopped around. It was only then that I could look at him again. 

"I'm sorry, Boss. This is your fight, not mine. Plus, look at this place. It's an absolute mess. I wanted to take care of you, not become one of your soldiers in this weird thing between you and Scar," I mumbled.

Boss tweeted angrily. 

"Yeah, 'weird thing' was a poor choice of words when he's trying to kill you. But the rest still stands." I said, sighing. I stood up from him, feeling strange. I sincerely didn't want to have to get in the middle of a bird battle. Or war. I had no idea who Boss was, but he was clearly a big deal in the bird world. I had to clean up the whole place and dodge Martha for like the next two weeks for making a fool of myself. And there was no way I was going outside so soon.

"I can help you heal. I will do whatever is in my power to keep you safe and secure here. But out there... Out there is not the best for me."

Boss puffed up into a small ball of feathers. He hopped around a few times, reevaluating his plans to go after Scar. He looked at me with a pain in his eyes I'd never seen in him. Even when I picked him up in his original injured state, he wasn't nearly to the level of pain he was in now. It wasn't physical pain. It was a hint of betrayal, but moreso disappointment. I sighed again. Then I startled, jumping back when I saw a figure at the edge of my vision.

A pigeon cooed from the broken window. Twisting its head curiously.

"How much of that did you hear?" I asked, embarrassed.

Boss chirped at it reluctantly. It cooed louder out the window and I heard dozens of flapping wings approach from outside again. 

"Uhh.. should we run again Boss?" I asked, panicked. He wouldn't even look at me. I ran to grab him again, but he hopped away quickly. A legion of pigeons swarmed the window but gave the two of us a wide berth. I watched them quizzically. They carried small bags in their beaks and landed at different intervals of the room. They pulled out tiny shovels from their bags and started filling their bag with the feathers and waste strewn about the apartment. I saw dozens of others flying in with carpet and counter cleaners. 

"Oh," I whispered, another sting of embarrassment washing over me. A raven followed in after them and dropped a watch at my feet, much like the earlier crows did. Only this bird went to go help the others instead of trying to remove my eyes. I knelt to pick up the watch and gasped. 

It was a Rolex.

"Boss, do you know how--" I looked up to see Boss was no longer in front of me. He was standing in front of the table where his cage was, waiting for me to put him back inside. I slipped the watch in my pocket. I got up slowly, my face flush. I put my hand out and he jumped into it, still not looking at me. I raised him to his cage and he went inside. I locked the door and filled some of his food and water. The whole time he stood entirely still, staring at the floor of his cage.

"Need anything else?" I asked hoarsely. He raised his good wing, dismissing me. 

"I'm--"

He raised the wing again.

I took a few steps of a walk of shame to my bed in the center of the room. The pigeons had already cleaned my bed and even replaced the comforter with a clean one. I sat down to try and assuage myself again. Boss was great, but he was part of something bigger. I was not fit for something bigger.

The truth was, the day I met Boss was the first time I'd left my apartment in months. I wasn't ready to leave again. I bit at the inside of my lip. I looked up at Boss, who and taken a few steps to begin nibbling at his food. He was the first thing I'd be able to call a friend. Also, the first thing I'd call an ex-friend, I supposed. I laid back on my bed, staring at the ceiling. Something landed at the foot of my bed.

I looked up to see another raven flying away. At the foot of my bed, it left a greeting card. My eyebrows came together and I rolled over to open it. It was plain, with only two words on it:

*I'm sorry.*

My heart dropped heavily. Boss was apologizing to me? For what? Things outside of his control? I looked up to him again, watching him get the smallest of drops of water dejectedly. It was the first time I'd ever been apologized to. The first time I could remember having someone consider what I felt, rather can try to just pull me out of my apartment. I stared at it until tears clouded my vision. I tucked it into my pocket.

"Boss," I swallowed hard, considering whether I really wanted to go through with it. "We're going after Scar."

He perked up at my announcement but wasn't convinced. He looked to me slowly, skepticism in his small, orbed eyes. 

"I'm--" my voice cracked. "I'm serious. Let's do it. Let's take him down, or whatever else you have planned since you don't want to kill him. Let's finish this, I'm with you to the end," I said, confidence growing in my voice.

Boss tweeted, making sure I was in.

"I'm telling you right now, I'm terrified of the outside world, but I think I've been doing a lot better with the birds. I even told some of them to shut up!" I laughed.

Boss glowed with pride. He tweeted encouragingly and flapped both of his wings. Of course, he immediately regretted flapping both, when his injured wing stung him with pain, but I laughed at his effort. I went to pick him up and threw different types of bird food into my pockets. We went to the front door, Boss perched on my shoulder. I stopped at the front door. 

Boss nodded and I nodded back, biting the inside of my lip. I swung the door open.

My eyes looked out to the world only to be met with a shocked Martha, whose hand was up as she prepared to knock on the door.

___________________________________________________________________I cleared my throat a bit and swallowed hard before continuing. It was hard to look at him. His image kept flickering under the bed like his whole existence was just a trick of the eyes. My legs were completely frozen, shaking slightly in fear.

"I'm sorry, did you just say rent?" I clarified.

"That's right. Have I not been paying enough?" he asked sincerely. I patted my pockets, feeling a small wad of cash that seemed to always be there in the mornings. Had to have been about seven or ten dollars a day.

"No, not at all, umm..." 

"Jobshtr," he introduced himself cordially, doing what I assumed was a bow as he passed through the floor in a swooping motion.

"Yeah..." I trailed, looking over my shoulder to see if any of my roommates had come home yet. I still couldn't move my legs and I was getting pretty worried.

"And why have you been paying?" I asked.

"I saw what you and your mates did to Ben. I wasn't about to have that happen to me," he said matter-of-factly, shaking his head in a blur. 

"Ben...? Do you mean Benjamin?"

"That's right, the bloke you evicted after the first month," he nodded.

"After he didn't pay his rent," I mused out loud. Again, Jobshtr nodded in agreement. I shook my head, opening and closing my mouth a few times as questions came in and were overpowered by questions more pertinent than the last.

"Where do you get this money from?" I asked, again craning my neck to get a look at the front door and see that it hadn't moved at all.

"Work, mostly," he shrugged.

"What uh... What line of work are you in Jobshtr?"

"Contractual stuff. I haunt a few places, reap a few souls, eat a couple of people, you know the likes of things of that nature. What about you?" he asked, shifting in place. Evidently, he was getting as uncomfortable with the small talk as I was. 

"I'm still at school," I said measuredly, urging my feet to move, but they wouldn't respond.

"Ah, education, right. That's important," he nodded. He noticed me looking at the door. "Your flatmates are out for the rest of the week, went to their parent's place, remember?" The thought hit me hard, and my heart started dancing a bit more anxiously.

We looked around each other for a few seconds, trying to think of something else to say. He breathed out loudly. I swallowed hard again, mustering the courage to ask the next question.

"Is there any reason you've paralyzed my feet, Jobshtr? Not that it's a problem, I'm mostly just curious," I asked, terrified of the answer.

"Ah, right. I got spooked and froze your legs when you looked like you were gonna crawl into my room. Not a good move to sneak into another monster's privacy, eh?" he chuckled. I waited for him to continue, but he just stared.

"Is there any way you can turn it off?" I suggested.

"Ah, no, but it'll wear off on its own," he nodded. I sighed in relief as he finished, "in about a hundred hours."

"A hundred hours!? I can't be frozen that long! I have to go to school! I have to eat Jobshtr! Am I going to die?" I screamed. 

"No, no, you'll be fine. I can bring you food and such. After all, what kind of roommate would I be to leave you to die, huh? What kind of meals do you like, children, the ill, the elderly, I can reap them all," he said confidently.

"No, I-- I'd much rather be free," I countered.

"Nothing I can do about that," he shook his head sympathetically. I looked back to the front door, then to my legs and sighed. I looked up to him, and asked,

"How do the elderly taste?"The owl looked up at me waking up, analyzing me with its intelligent eyes.

"Ah!" I screamed and shot my arm under my pillow, pulling out a gun.

"Hoot?" the owl just had enough say before I shot its face. I kept the gun trained on it and looked around my room rapidly. I looked at its body, a spatter of blood staining my pillow.

For years, I'd been shooting owls and birds that tried to invade my room. Years ago, I watched my dad shoot one that I was trying to get into my room. I was mad at him at the time, upset that his paranoia had driven him to kill a poor animal. Soon, it became evident that these birds were sent intentionally, as at least once a week they'd come to try and get into my room. Sometimes as often as once a day. Each more adamant than the last. We'd shoot them all and burn their remains, of course. Every last one couldn't be trusted. 

And we knew what we did was right since the plagues only began after the birds started showing up. Fires starting spontaneously in our crop fields. Tornadoes. Hail strong enough to leave dents in our roof. Year after year they got worse. And the birds were just another on the list of plagues. They haunted me.

I got up and closed the window. I had always thought it safe to keep it open at night since they only tried to visit in the day. Evidently they changed tactics. I grabbed the animal corpse by its wing and dragged it off the bed, which caused a letter to fall off its leg and roll open. I shielded my eyes, not having opened any of the past correspondence for fear it was laced with anthrax or something. But it was too late. In the moment it took to glance at it, I read the words *Sorry we are 10 years late.*

"Huh?" I chucked the owl into the trash and grabbed the paper. It was just a plain old letter. My mind was slowly coming to terms with the hundreds of birds I'd killed to not receive a letter. But my dad said it was dangerous! It was just a habit at this point!

*Sorry we are 10 years late.*

*It's clear that our enemies are capturing our letters to you, but we send them holding out hope that someday our owls will be well trained enough to evade whatever tactics keep striking them down. Our hearts grieve for our lost animals. But it will all be worth it to one day make contact with you.*

I swallowed hard and looked at the bird in the trashcan. Then I took a glance out the window to the mass grave right outside my house. Hundreds of letters and birds within it. 

*We have waited long to finally meet you. A decade, at least. Within you is the power needed to stop the disasters plaguing our lands. The fires, storms, earthquakes, all of it can be stopped by your power! We need you to come and take charge of us, to lead us to a calm and tranquil land once again. One that isn't targeted by endless weather disasters and mass destruction. Even our birds cannot escape it. They die at such a ruthless rate. Come to our hideout. We will teach you how to save us all.*

*The owl who sent this message will be able to lead you back.*

"Oh," I said softly, looking back at the stain on my pillow. 

"Oh," I said, turning my eyes to the trash can once more.

"Oh no," I said, standing to look at the mass grave as the morning's hailstorm rolled in.Choz gripped the Deus ex Machina tightly under his arm as he made his way to the demon king's castle. I kept up with him, almost out of breath trying to get him to come to his senses. He seemed to have an answer for everything, but the answers only lead me to more questions and confusion.

"All right, Choz, what about the Demon King's personal assistant? The guy whose name is literally Big Twist. Don't you find it *just a little* strange that he ended up being your brother?" I asked.

"Half brother!" Choz corrected, keeping his gait. "And I don't find it strange at all. My mother was mysterious and was known for working against the crown on the inside. She was disguised for years working as a chambermaid. So perhaps she married someone there, had the son, then divorced and fled. I don't find that so out of the question," he said confidently. 

"Not even the part where she also spoke of a prophecy about you the same night he had her first son and predicted the journey to Mount McGuffin?" I said, exasperated.

"Not at all! It's not even the most incredible thing Mary Sue was known for," he said proudly. 

I stopped in my tracks. 

"Your mom's literal name was Mary Sue!?" I screamed.

"That's right!"

"And your father was Martin Sue, I presume!?" I yelled sarcastically. 

He finally stopped mid-step. We were almost in front of the double doors to the castle now. But in this moment of hesitation, I might finally be able to get through to him. He sighed.

"I never knew my father," he said softly.

"Oh my God," I groaned. 

"But Mother always told me he was a great man. That he was... lost. But that someday I would meet him when the time was right," he announced grandly.

"And this all doesn't sound a little repetitive, or convenient to you!?" I screamed as he began marching again. Instead of responding, he held up the Deus ex Machina and blew the castle's door wide open. 

In front of us, in a grand room lay a dozen castle guards, knocked out by some mysterious circumstance. Choz stepped in cautiously, looking around the room while I waltzed in.

"It's your brother obviously. He listened to what you said and is a good guy, let's move on," I said, wanting to get this over with.

"Something's not right..." Choz said dramatically. "The guards were knocked out before we got here," he pointed out.

"Y--" I blinked a few times. "Yeah, obviously. I just said--"

Suddenly, a silhouette appeared from behind a curtain and ran toward us. Choz ran up to shield me while I rolled my eyes.

"Brother!!" he screamed, surprised. 

"Brother!!" Big Twist yelled jubilantly, opening his arms to show off the room. "I've had a change of heart. I'm sorry for what I said before. I love you," he announced.

"Brother..." Choz said with a tear in his eye. 

"I will stand with you to fight the Demon King but know he is much stronger than me. Stronger than anyone you've ever faced. Are you ready?" he asked seriously. He looked worriedly to the room ahead, presumably where the Demon King sat waiting.

"Yes!" I yelled, rubbing my temples, "Yes, we're ready, let's go!" 

The room was silent for a few moments while Choz let a dramatic moment pass. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.

"I'm ready," he said, opening his eyes with fiery determination.

The three of us ran forward and broke through to the throne room. The Demon King sat leisurely on his throne, lifting an eyebrow from behind his white mask to the three of us entering.

"Ah, if it isn't Choz N. Wan and his pitiful brother Big Twist. How completely predictable," he laughed to himself, his laughter filling the chamber. Then his mask turned to me. 

"Oh, um, who are you sup--"

"It literally doesn't matter, just keep going," I said impatiently.

"Demon King! I have seen what you've done to the people of this world. But now..." Choz breathed impressively, "your reign of tyranny is over. I have the Dues Ex Machina. My family will be free of your anguish, now and forever!"

The Demon King laughed even louder and sat up straighter.

"Your entire family? Are you sure?" he asked mischievously, reaching a hand up to his mask.

"Oh, no, please no," I groaned under my breath.

"Including your father!?" the Demon King screamed, tearing the mask off of his face to reveal a face that looked similar to Choz's. Choz and Big gasped loudly, reeling from shock. "That's right, I'm Forbed N. Wan! Your biological father! The Deus Ex Machina won't work on me!" he screamed to the heavens. 

"Nooooo!" Choz screamed dropping to his knees. 

I fell down on the floor too, unable to keep up with these antics much longer."Oh, Dad, I thought you were an amazing--"

"Not now," I snapped, squinting into the corner of the room.

"Dad, are... do you see a light?" my son asked fearfully.

"Easy mode?" I scoffed.

"He may have lost it," his wife said, consoling him.

"How is this easy mode!? I outlived my wife for decades! I haven't been able to take myself to the bathroom for the past three weeks, and my cat died right when I was going through being laid off from work!" I yelled.

"Dad--"

"Hush, honey, I think he wants to take the time to recall his life," she said.

"All the illnesses, the deaths in the family, the constant bickering with my college professors just to get a passing grade! I never had an ounce of focus in my childhood thanks to the undiagnosed ADHD that drove every adult I met to hate me within minutes!" I took a deep breath, glaring at the notifications. My son looked like he wanted to say something, but I kept going. 

"I think the only *good* in my life was my wife and son! And that's not easy! Child rearing is no cake walk, it took a lot of hard work. I emphasize *hard* work because I remember a number of weeks I went without sleep just so I could one day provide a college education to my son and a lasting home for my wife, whom, needn't I remind you, *died* years before seeing that family home she longed for!" I said, losing my composure and throwing my pudding at the wall.

"Dad, are you okay?"

"No, son, I'm dying. And apparently, I've had an easy life. Surely this is considered an easy death, too," I spat.

My son and his wife looked at each other. 

"Well, surely you had a good life," she suggested. 

"Eh," I said, looking the notifications squarely in the.. notification window. "I worked hard to become successful and to provide for my family."

"And you did a wonderful job," my son nodded eagerly. 

"I did, didn't I? So much so I could *easily* do it again," I said.

"Uhhh..."

"Yeah, I'll take on this new character, no sweat. Just you watch," I said, kneeling back into my bed. I heard my son try to wake me, but I was only listening for the flatline of my heart. I drifted out of this life. 

I awoke in a cold, dark place, crying my eyes out. It smelled rancid and I seemed to be surrounded by garbage.

"I told you a million times, I don't want a baby!" a young girl screamed at the top of her lungs.

"Okay, but you *can't* leave it in a *dumpster!*" another girl yelled back.

"Watch me!" she yelled as a car screeched against the pavement and sped off. I cried for a few seconds more before a new notification appeared at the edge of the dumpster. 

*Hard mode:* ***Begin!***I looked down on the tiny body before me, chewing slowly on a melting bar of chocolate. She looked at me nodding like she was impressed with the results of the summoning. I looked around the rest of the room. Somehow it seemed the spellcaster had left the room in the time it took me to be summoned.

"Who *dares* to summon Drylfix, destroyer of all!?" I demanded, yelling towards the door to bring out the coward who likely fled the scene.

"My name's Joy," the little girl said, twirling a finger in her hair and leaving behind a smudge of chocolate. I loomed over her, growing in size, showing her my immense fortitude. She took another bite of her chocolate and watched me intently. 

"And where is the one who summoned me!?" I boomed, blowing her hair back. She blinked a few times in confusion. 

"My name is Joy," she repeated slowly.

"No, I meant--" I shrunk a few sizes and tried to level my eye-line to hers. "*You* summoned me?" I asked.

She took another bite of the chocolate bar, nodding. 

"You didn't-- how did you manage to summon me!?" I asked.

She held up the incantation book with a smile and took the last bite of chocolate left. She chewed the last piece slowly, savoring its flavor all the while staring at me contently. She threw the wrapper aside and poked at the book with her chocolate infested fingers.

"This says you have to be my surfer until I say so, right?" she said, looking up at me.

"It says serf," I said, rubbing my temples slowly. 

"Is that like a surfer?" she asked, disappointed. 

"No, it means I serve your needs as a slave, little one," I replied, offended by her disinterest. 

"Oh..." she thought for a moment, reading on in the text. "It also says you're good at an-- anni--" she frowned.

"It's ok, sound it out," I encouraged. 

"Annlating people?"

"Annihilating people," I corrected.

"And that's not a surfer move?" she asked. I shook my head.

"Dad says that I can't get a surf instructor unless I do good in school, but wanna learn how to surf right now cause I'm not that good at math and think it would be easy to just learn it from my surfer like you," she said.

"Again, I'm not a surfer," I tried remaining patient.

"You're my slave?" she recollected.

"That's right."

"Do you know how to surf?" 

"I've never tried it before?"

"But if I asked you to teach me how to surf, you would try as hard as you could to do it?"

I hesitated, grimacing a little bit at my answer.

"Yes, that's right," I lamented. She nodded thoughtfully and looked back at the text in front of her. Then back to me. Then back to the text. She nodded some more and then quickly looked excited to ask me for her first request.

"Can you please force Dad to get me a surf teacher so I can learn how to surf?" she asked, sweetly.

My eyebrows went up in surprise. I liked this one.

__________________________________________________________________________"A-- A jerk butt?! I am *not* a jerk butt!" the alien yelled indignantly, pulling his weapon back from my face.

"Yeah you are, and your mom is a poopy pants too!" I yelled, wiping the sweat off my face to try and look more intimidating.

"Mom?" it asked.

"Uhh.. your leader is a poopy pant?" I said hesitantly.

"Nuh-uh!" the creature yelled, flailing its arms and dropping its weapon on the ground. That didn't bother it at all as it warped right up to an inch from my nose and hissed,

"Leader. **Is not.** A poopy pants."

"Your breath stinks too," I replied through closed eyes. It terrified me, and I couldn't look at it when it got so close. But its breath was actually surprisingly pleasant.

"AAHHHHHHH!!" it screamed and ran out of the room, its screams following it down the hall. I dove to the weapon and tried to figure out how it worked. It looked nothing like a gun and I couldn't find anything that resembled a trigger. I only knew which side to point away from me, but otherwise couldn't tell how it would function. I pointed it away from me and bashed against it a few times. Nothing.

Multiple footsteps were approaching from the hallway now. A battalion of creatures. I looked around the room for shelter. Only a few desks and chairs. That's what I get for hiding in the office. I swung the weapon around more to no avail as about a dozen of the creatures came around the corner and stopped when they saw that I held a weapon. 

With only a moments hesitation, they put up shields that would presumably protect them from the weapon, since they were no longer fazed by my swinging it around at them. The largest of the creatures floated ahead of the rest, its arm around the shoulder of the one I insulted earlier.

"This is human?" 

"Y-- yeah, that's the one. He called me... He said the mean things..." the alien said sheepishly.

A gun was trained on me in an instant and I dove behind a desk. The place I stood only a moment earlier burst into flames. A projectile never even left the gun, the location was just incinerated instantly. I took a deep breath to calm my nerves and tried to speak as fast as I could,

"Why are you helping the one that called you a fat loser?" I yelled from behind the desk. 

I heard the weapon powering up. Maybe this larger creature was more immune to insults. If that was the case, I was done for. 

"And he said he would bring you over to show me how fat you were and all of the other people were uhh... sweaty whale aliens-- I mean sweaty whale things! He called you all things!" 

Without even giving me a response, the weapon fired again. My eyes were screwed shut, but I heard something scream from behind the desk. Peeking my head out, I saw that multiple aliens and shot and disintegrated the alien that brought them all in. My eyes widened in fear when the larger one turned to look at me. There was some green fluid streaming down its head. Their blood was blue, so I couldn't tell what this was.

"Did Yulzhag really say all those things?" the larger one sputtered. It was crying! The green was some kind of tears!

"Oh yeah, but that's probably because he heard it from all his friends behind you. I mean, they all call you a... a goose butt and a yucky gross thing whenever you're not in the room," I said, knowing that my lack of insults would probably lead to my death. 

The leader looked back to the others. 

"My own brothers," it said, rage enveloping its being to the point of changing the creature to a hue of red.

"Brother no!" one called before the group of them all exploded. 

It turned back around to me as I stood shakily from the floor, weapon still in hand. 

"You're nice, right?" it said, sniffling and crying more green ooze. I had no idea what would lead to my death anymore so I just nodded quickly, too exhausted and full of fear to come up with a new insult. I dropped my gun, which went off as soon as it hit the floor. It blew off the lower half of the alien. It only cried out in pain, breathed once loudly, and whispered painfully,

"Liar."

Somehow it hurt to hear him say that to me after he trusted my word so much. It died without another movement and I sighed in relief. I made my way down the stairs preparing a litany of insults in case I made contact with any more of the things. 

On the next floor down, I heard something dart around the corner and let out a war cry when it caught sight of me. I dove behind a shelf as fast as I could and yelled,

"What's wrong, smelly?" 

It stopped in place, and let out a long, offended gasp.My first patient walked into my office, his movements were frigid as if he was making a lot of effort to get in place without spooking anything. I nodded to him affably with a wide smile on my face and greeted him,

"Hello George, how are you doing today?"

The question seemed to stun him, and he froze about a foot away from placing himself in his seat, his neck craned looking up. He nodded and eventually sat down. He opened his mouth as if to respond, but then closed it about three seconds later. He sat staring through me, waiting patiently. I took note of all of this. Nothing seemed in place.

"Did you... sleep well?" I asked facetiously.

"No, I haven't slept at all," he answered simply. Almost quietly. I nodded, encouraged. Four months in and it was still working!

"How have you been spending your nights? Are they more productive?" I asked, opening up another tab on my laptop to see his medical results from earlier this morning. 

Once again, he seemed too occupied to respond. Long enough for me to see that all of his bloodwork was fine, his body had not changed function since before the test, but behaviorally it was noted that something was off. They couldn't say much more than that since it was my job to track behavioral changes personally.

"How have your nights been? Any more work getting done?" I repeated. I double checked to make sure his ears hadn't suffered any detrimental changes. He'd passed every ear exam.

"I have more dreams," he said, now looking behind me. I nodded excitedly, considering the idea that with 30% more time in one's life, they would also come up with more accomplishments. But how lofty were these goals?

"What kinds of aspirations?" I asked.

"Are you real?" he asked.

My eyebrows furrowed together. This was more than slight behavioral changes.

"I don't think the test is going as great as it started," he said, still speaking toward something behind me. 

"Why would you--" my voice got caught in my throat when I turned around to see what he was so fixated on. Behind me loomed a seven-foot tall creature in a lab coat, taking vigorous notes in a notebook. It was bobbing its head seriously while licking his vicious teeth peeking out from beneath his thin, stretched lips. It looked at me, driving my blood to freeze, but it only tilted its head toward me, as if to suggest I should continue my line of questions to George.

"George, what is that?" I asked, my fingers locked an inch above my keyboard.

"I don't know," he answered, seemingly satisfied that I was seeing it too.

"How long has it been in here?" I quavered.

"Since I started dreaming. It was about the moment before I sat down," he said.

"Since you started... dreaming?" I repeated. Now that I was aware of its presence, I could hear the creatures pen scratching against its pages.

"Yeah, I still dream just like when I used to sleep, except now my dreams just join in with reality. Not too long, they only last about eight hours a day," he said. He reached out a hand and poked me in the face. I barely had the mindfulness to flinch with the creature looming behind me.

"Then things go back to the way they were?" I asked, fascinated.

"No, they just kinda stick around as they are. I'm loaded now, I started off dreaming a lot about money, but these days it seems I'm having a lot more nightmares," he said, quietly.

The creature snapped its jaws behind me as if to accentuate his point.

"And how long has this been..." I looked down to see that my laptop was now a large saltine cracker laying across my lap. Inscribed in it were the notes I'd taken earlier. Without missing a beat, George broke off a piece of the corner and nibbled into it. Having something to chew on calmed his nerves. 

"It was about three months in. I just started noticing weird things going on. Misplaced things would change into other things, pieces of furniture seemed to move. When I first saw my curtains wave goodbye one morning I thought I was actually dreaming! Then it just kinda became the new normal. At least until the nightmares. They aren't as easy to get used to.." he said, nodding toward the monster pointedly.

The lights in my office began to set like the sun, and dipped below the horizon of my floor, leaving us in absolute darkness. I began glowing in the dark, a strangely pleasurable, yet painful sensation.

"When do you know when the dreams end?" I asked, watching my hands melt away into sand. I was too intrigued to feel any panic I was due.

"To me, they don't. It's too hard to keep track of when stuff's real and when it's not. This is just the new normal. But I finally got around to writing a book I'd been working on!" he said excitedly.

I wanted to say something congratulatory, but I was stuck in a glass vase, lighting up the room as a lamp would. Maybe I was a lamp? Luckily, my creature assistant was able to escort the subject out of the room at the conclusion of the interview.I waited in the cottage silently, peeking out from my curtain right beyond my protective layer of flowers.

"Today?" I asked, looking to the dandelion sitting in my windowsill.

"Today they said they would take you out," it said in a very high pitched voice. It was young, almost a baby, and had yet to give way to its beautiful prime of a blossoming yellow flower. Its company gave me comfort, as it seemed to be the only flower that was in the vicinity of the League when they planned their assault on me. It hadn't heard much, but it was certain of what it was saying. I was in for the fight of my life. 

"Do you think the roof will hold under them?"

"I don't think they'll land on the roof," it said, sounding dazed like the topic didn't make sense to it. Such was flower youth.

"Yeah, too obvious," I agreed, taking another looks out from behind the curtains. A speck in the distance was making itself clear. There were three of them. One flying and two being carried in. They landed at a much further distance from my house than I had anticipated. I bit my lip. How could they know my counterattack so well?

"Flower Power! Hello? That's the name you go by, right? We've been looking for you!" one bellowed to my cottage. The Chanter. He was said to be able to yell so loud, he could leave someone deaf from a mile away. I didn't move, not wanting to let my presence known. 

"Should we knock on the door?" the heroine next to him asked. I wasn't familiar with her, but I knew she could fly and was strong enough to carry two people without breaking a sweat. 

"Oh, the flowers in front of Flower Power's house are *so* beautiful!" Atomic Life squealed. I was worried about her. She could split the atoms in anything she came in contact with and survive the resulting blast. But I don't think she'd want to risk the lives of the other 'heroes' around her.

Two of them walked toward my front door while Atomic Life began rolling in the dandelions and English Broom at the edge of my meadow. The flowers' screams rose in fear and were then smothered to death. They called for revenge and knew they would soon have it with the rate she was rolling and laughing in their corpses. 

"The poor things," I said, spitting at her disregard for flower life. 

"Why are they doing that to flowers?" my dandelion asked curiously.

"That's what they do. They seem to hate anything outside their organization," I answered.

The dandelion didn't answer, likely getting a grasp at what death on a mass scale looked like. Not many flowers experienced watching so many of their brethren die, but I couldn't move it away in fear of giving away my location.

"Wow, what are these purple ones?" the flying hero asked, interested. She picked up a Monkshood. With her bare hands. Excellent.

"Wow, that smells amazing!" Chanter yelled, louder than he needed to. I added scents to them, hoping to get them to bring it closer to their faces. The flying heroine did, but Chanter had something else in his hand. A gun?

"Hey, how come..." she collapsed, numbed and paralyzed by the Monkshood's toxins. Increased toxins, I should say, as I convinced them to produce more for the sake of this encounter. Chanter dropped down to the flying heroine and quickly yelled back to Atomic Life.

"Atomic!!" he screamed in panic. When he looked over to her, he saw she was motionless in the flowers as well. Affected by her consumption of the English Brood. I didn't think they'd be stupid enough to ingest anything, but it was good that I prepared for it.

"Is it time?" the Angel's Trumpets hanging above my door asked in a sirene voice, "we tire of watching the other flowers get trampled while one of them still stands."

"Not yet!" I hissed, looking at the door. My movement gave my position away. 

"Flower Power! What did you do to them!?" Chanter screamed I plugged my ears as he approached my cottage. He was waving frantically. Finally, he ran up to my door and started banging on it, trying to break in.

"NOW!" I yelled to the Angel's Trumpets, and they all released a downpour of day's worth of scopolamine. Chanter choked for a moment, then collapsed. I flung the door open to watch the three of them in dismay.

"Thought just because I spoke to flowers that you'd be able to kill me easily! Think again so-called 'Hero Leauge,' there are many ways to kill a man, even with powers like mine."

"Kill you?" Chanter coughed, his eyes swelling as he lost consciousness to the toxins, "we just wanted... to take... you out to..." he passed out, opening his hand to reveal a gift card to a restaurant. 

My smile curved downwards as I looked again at the damage I'd done. 

"Dandelion, you..." I looked back to the flower that was swaying side to side in its youth and innocence, blissfully unaware of the loss of life that went on before it.

"Did they take you out or not?" it asked, curiously.*"I know you're listening,"* he thought, eyes looking around with a stupid grin on his face. He was making eye contact with everyone he could as he continued to think it.

*"I* ***know*** *you're listening!"* he thought, even more emphatically as he looked very hard at the girl that was asleep in the chair at the corner of the room, away from the both of us.

I breathed deeply. This has happened a number of times before, especially after there was the psychic that freaked out on the train because someone did it a few years ago. Brought about a lot of copycats trying to elicit the same reaction and out you as a psychic. But they usually never lasted longer than ten minutes. It had been two hours.

"We are sorry to report that the flight has been delayed another hour. We are doing everything we can to speed this process us, but we appreciate your patience in the meantime," the intercom announced to the room. We collectively groaned. 

*"Hear that? You get to listen to me even longer!"* he thought excitedly. He was looking at a father and his restless son, who had long ago grown bored of mashing his cars together. 

*"Isn't this fun? I love talking to you like this,"* he thought mischievously. His gazed glossed over me and stopped on the guy to my right. I kept myself from frowning for the umpteenth time. My jaw was locked to tightly, I might start cracking my teeth. I'd gone for years without telling a single soul about my ability. Most people's friends and family know, but not mine. And this brainless inciter was not going to get the best of me. But he really really needed to shut up.

*"Hey!! You're listening, right?"* he thought again.

He never sounded bored of it.

*"I know you're listening."*

He wouldn't stop.

*"Just admit it and I'll stop, I promise."*

Tempting.

I got up to go to the bathroom and maybe stay out of his thoughts for a couple minutes. But I didn't like people's thoughts while they went to the bathroom, so I knew I couldn't stay away for long. I followed closely behind some other people just in case.

*"Going to the bathroom, are we?"* he thought, in an uppity voice. 

I ignored him.

*"Don't think I don't know it's you. I've known it was you since the beginning!*" he thought, giddily.

My heart dropped, but I didn't alter my pace at all. He had to be bluffing. Right?

*"Come on, it's so obvious. Going to the bathroom to get away from me. No one else left with such a static look on their face. Most people look upset that the flight is delayed, but you have barely shown any reaction,"* he continued.

I finally entered the bathroom behind two others and walked into the first stall I could find, locking the stall behind me. I sat on the toilet seat, not wanting to look too suspicious and ignoring the shiver of disgust that went through me. At least it was quiet.

*"Oh, gosh, I didn't think I was gonna make it. If my mom knew how close I was to losing it, she would put me in diapers again,"* someone at the urinal thought as he relieved himself.

Okay, well it was still better than that other guy.

*"Hey, I followed you in here! I told you, I already know you're the psychic!"*

*No.*

"*I thought about it for a while, and you've statistically got to be the one, based on the number of people on this flight. I'm gonna mess with you the whole flight unless you fess up now. I know you're listening!"*

*No, no, no.*

*"Come on out of the stall. I'll wait either way,"* he said, patiently.

I slapped my hands to my face and rubbed my head. Did he seriously go this far to figure me out? How did he even figure me out.

*"Come on, I'll stop once you're out. But you have to admit it."*

Sweat slid down my arms and face.

*"Don't be shy."*

I got up, hesitantly. No use in hiding if he already knew. Plus it would finally shut him up.

I opened the stall and spoke at the same time.

"How did you figure me out?" I asked, looking at the empty space in front of me. 

He stood in front of the stall next to me, looking straight at it. His eyes grew wide as he slowly rotated his head to my direction. I realized that he never thought it was me, but the one that walked into the bathroom before me. He looked shocked, and his breathing sped upwith anticipation.

*"****This*** *guy's the psychic!?"*"Ms. Eloy, how come--" Susie began coughing before she could complete her thought. Ms. Eloy waited patiently for her to stop, knowing that it could be a while with the cancer taking more out of Susie by the day. It couldn't kill her, but it could do everything in its power to make her wish she would be.

"How come most people can't walk?" she asked, pointing to the half of the class either in wheelchairs or with crutches.

"Excellent question, Susie. I suppose it's time to teach you about a fundamental fact of life. About misery that we're all planned to have in our lives," Ms. Eloy responded slowly. She wanted to make sure to keep her heart under control.

"What does 'fundamental' mean?" asked a student.

"What's fun?" asked another.

"A lot of questions today," she said, sighing. She never liked kids and their endless questions.

"Fundamental means it's going to be around no matter what. So long as we are alive, we will be perpetually sad or in pain," she explained. Some of the kids nodded in agreement, already having talked about it with their parents or coming to the conclusion themselves.

"Is that why my headaches never go away?" Johnny asked with his eyes screwed shut in pain.

"That's right, but not everyone is going to have splitting headaches. Some people will never be able to walk. Or eat most foods. Or even leave their hometown!" she said, excited to bring the children down a peg.

"Will some people be lonely for their whole life?" Susie asked. 

Ms. Eloy blinked in surprise. A surprise that flowed quickly to anger, then to depression. She'd been *Ms.* Eloy longer than she'd intended to be. She couldn't tell if Susie picked up on it or just wanted to know if she would be alone for life. 

"I don't know if I'd say that. People are alive for a very long time now, so their whole life could be some time," she reassured herself.

"Mr. Eloy, how old are you?" asked a student in the back.

"What? That's not the kind of question you ask," she stuttered.

"But I ask people how old they are all the time and they don't get mad. Are you really old?" he continued. Ms. Eloy craned her neck to see it was Henry.

"No, Henry, I'm not really old," she replied curtly.

"Umm... Bobby says you're a hundred years old--"

"Nuh-uh! I said she was more than a hundred!" Bobby spat back, taken umbrage at the mistake.

"I'm not more than a hundred--"

"So you're a hundred!" Henry claimed with confidence.

"I'm ninety-three, all right? I'm alone and ninety-three, I'm not over one hundred!" she screamed at the class.

The class remained silent for a few moments, allowing Eloy to calm down. Susie was lost in thought and finally came to a conclusion.

"My grandpa got married five times when he turned ninety, does that mean you aren't good at getting married ms. Eloy?" she asked sincerely.

Eloy was going to explode back at them, but before she had the chance, her heart began attacking her. That is to say, she had a heart attack. As she slowly crumbled to the ground and the class followed the procedure for when she had heart attacks, she wondered if this would be the one to paralyze her for life."Ah, so you've found my hideout have you?" I cackled, my voice echoing across the bunker.

"That's right Frightmare! And now your reign of tyranny is over!" My nemesis, Justmaster, stood proud, his chest puffed and his muscles thoroughly flexed. He took some time to strike a few poses, each more gratuitous than the last. I did the sportsmanlike thing and let him finish the routine before continuing.

"But now that I have you in my bunker, I have you at my mercy!" I cried, relishing the echoes of my voice once more.

"That's what you think Fri-- Whoa!" Justmaster collapsed backward as an ax flew from the ceiling and landed inches in front of him. He looked visibly shaken.

"Nice reflexes, *Rustmaster,* but I am fully prepared for your antics. Behold the wall of flames!" I yelled, activating the walls of flame around him. It blocked his exit, as well as any path toward me. It blasted so large that it even reached in front of me, but not enough to make me flinch. It danced around my cape for a moment. He began sweating a little and put on an uneasy smile.

"Okay Frightmare, looks like you pulled out all the stop--"

"What that? This is nothing to you? Well, that's fine since I planned for the contingency in which you would wear your flame-retardant suit! I placed a minefield all around this bunker, the slightest misstep and you'll be blown sky high!" I declared, activating the blast field in front of me and pulling out a gas mask.

"Okay, umm, you think I have a flame--"

"Oh, so you don't fear the explosions, do you? Thought you could test each step with ample time? That's why as soon as you came through the door, I started pumping this entire place with a powerful neurotoxin!! In five minutes, the entire bunker will be entirely saturated by it, rendering anyone who breathes it so paralyzed that even their lungs will stop breathing any air!"

Justmaster looked at me, his eyebrows crawling together. His eyes grew wide and he cleared his throat.

"Sorry, you said I only have five minutes to get out of this before you literally kill me?" he squeaked. 

"What, you believe I've given you more than enough time? I'd like to see you try!" I said haughtily.

"No, I was just thinking maybe I was a little rash in barging in unannounced, you know?" he said, more quietly than before. "Maybe I should come back another time?" He was almost whispering at this point, his neck twisting rapidly as the fire wall began closing in on him.

"I thought you'd might try to mock me, Justmaster!" I boomed.

"No, please, I wasn't mocki--!"

"That's why I brought them along!" I said, pointing to the ceiling above us. He looked up and the look on his face became even more pronounced as he saw his pet kitten gagged and dangling over the blazing inferno that approached him.

"FRIGHTMARE!!" he coughed. "Please! Let Mittens go! I'm sorry I came! I'll do anything! Why did you--"

I turned my back to him and laughed.

"You thought just because you moved hideouts that I wouldn't be able to keep track of you, right?"

"I moved because the apartment was cheaper and closer to a gym!" he cried, tears rolling from his eyes.

"Don't toy with me!" 

"Please, let us go! I'll do anything! I'll join you! Please, just..." his eyes drooped as he began nodding off from the neurotoxins.

"That's right! Grovel in..." I looked at my cape. It was singed at the corner, ruining its immaculate sheen. 

"Grovel in..." I looked up at Justmaster who had already collapsed and was very nearly being burned alive by the flames.

"How did you burn my cape? Is this some kind of poison!? It'll rot my clothes until it reaches me and then eats me from the inside out and only you have the antidote?" I screamed in fear.

He was still unconscious. Somehow he'd outwitted me again. How did he keep doing this? I'd have to analyze the cape and find a cure myself, but just in case I couldn't figure it out in time...

"Computer, shut off all traps and remove the toxic gas!" I cried. Immediately, the room returned to its original state and with a blast of wind, returned all the natural air in the room. I watched my cape as it billowed. How did he get me? 

He groaned on the other side of the bunker and I spun extravagantly to go analyze what he'd done to me. I'd get him next time. My cunning would soon overpower him. If only he wasn't so good at foiling all my plans at the last moment."Oh, you're here to stop me?" the general mocked from behind his pane of glass. "That'll be interesting. You see, this is bulletproof glass. It's made special for you. I know you can stop time, but how will that help you get through something impenetrable by human means? You can't use technology in a frozen universe!"

My eyes drooped momentarily as I gave a massive yawn. I scratched the back of my head as I looked out the window of his massive high rise office. The tanks of his army were rolling over the streets dozens of stories below us as we spoke. I rubbed leaned out the window to get a better view. Looked like hundreds of men and about ten tanks out there.

"I'm sorry, what exactly is your plan with this? You just stay in the box and you'll be safe?" I asked.

"Don't act so nonchalant. I am guaranteed safety in this box. How would you get in? How could I affected by the power that fate decided to grant you?" he asked jovially, opening his arms.

"Okay, sure, let's play this to its logical conclusion. Let's say that I can't affect you from out here--"

"Don't play coy, I know you can't get in here!" he yelled louder this time. He was clearly trying to convince himself at this point. A bead of sweat rolled down his nose.

"Right, okay, but again, what now? What's the plan. How are you gonna command the troops?" I asked, crouching down and taking a seat on the floor. He balked at my disrespect. 

"I have a walkie-talkie that I can use to communicate with them," he said, holding up the device playfully. 

"Uh, huh. And how does that help you?" I asked. He glared at me and grit his teeth. He pressed down on the button with a menacing grin.

"Commander Rodriguez! Kill everyone in the park. All the hostages, don't leave a single--" I took about thirty minutes of his life right then and froze time with it. I had plenty of time stored within me, but I wanted to use his own life to thwart his plans. It took me about fifteen minutes just to walk down the flight of stairs and another two to catch my breath. I made my way over to the park I saw from the window and saw a man holding a walkie talkie in one hand and pointing his firearm at a child with the other. 

I frowned at how willing this man was to follow the order. I stole the rest of his life. He had about a decade left in him. Seemed he had cancer that would come to affect him the coming years and end his life years after that. After that, I untied all the men, women, and children in the park and stood them up. I would have liked to move them out of the park but I didn't have the strength to do something like that. It took enough out of me just to put them in a standing position. 

I looked back up at the tower that I had just climbed down and groaned. I would have to walk back up all the flights of stairs now. I don't know why I was playing this game with this mad man, but hopefully, it would be satisfying to see how this ends up. I looked around the rest of the streets of the city and took the time left in those marching down the streets and those driving the tanks. Might as well deal with that all now rather than running back up and down those stairs.

When I made it back to the top, I sat back down where I was earlier and allowed time to flow once again. The general continued right where he left off,

"--one! We don't need them! That's an order Rodriguez, no questions!" he grinned as he waited for the response. He waited about twenty seconds before his smile faltered. 

"Rodriguez?" he yelled into the walkie. 

I raised my eyebrows at him, looking as if to ask a question.

"Rodriguez, give me an answer! What's happening down there!?" 

More silence.

"Becker! What happened to Rodriguez, he won't answer!" he screamed, growing increasingly more anxious. The whites of his eyes began to grow as he slowly turned his gaze to me.

"Danvers! Richards! Anyone? Answer me!" He was pleading with them now, the authority in his voice gone. He dropped the communicator and looked at me with quivering eyes.

"What happened?" I asked innocently, picking some scum out from under my nails.

"What did you do!?" he bellowed, bashing his fists against the glass. 

"Me? I thought you said I couldn't affect you. This looks like it's having an effect on you. Clearly couldn't have been me," I answered, picking some more dirt out.

"Do you know what you-- I can't-- No matter! You still can't touch me in here," he said, grandly opening his hands once again. 

"Wow, all right, if you say so. Guess I can't just fire a tank or mortar and then move the shell into this room and target you, huh?" I said, finally making eye contact with him.

"...You can't do that," he said uneasily.

"Since when did you become an expert on what I can or can't do? Let me tell you about your oversights. I can fire a missile in here, I can deprive the box you're in of oxygen by blocking off the whole thing until you literally suffocate, I can douse the whole thing in gasoline and light it up, or I can literally wait you out. I have all the time in the world to watch you. I have hundreds of years accumulated at this point. I can sit here in real time and use my frozen time to sleep and eat. You will surrender at some point and walk out. You wanna pick which one I should do to you?" I asked cooly.

"I... You can't... You can't..." he shook his head as the information flooded into him. He finally fell to his knees and pressed himself to the glass in fear. "Please don't hurt me. Please let me go. I'm sorry. Please, just..." he began crying.

"I leave you to the rest of your life. You look to be about 40, so if you're healthy, you should have at least another 40 in you," I said, standing to leave.

"What do--" he asked, his voice strained as he looked, horrified at his fingers. He watched as 39 years of life was sapped out of him, his figure slouching and his fingers wrinkling as his bones flared up in aches and formerly innocuous pains. The old man looked up at me, his adam's apple trembling as he felt his hands over and over, trying to understand what I had done. He was lucky. If he had less than 39 years of life left in him, he would die before I could complete the extraction.

"Have a good life," I said over my shoulder."You can seriously fix this?" the construction worker asked, scratching the back of his head with wonder.

"Sure, I don't see why not. So, what are you looking for? A park or something?" I said, pulling back my sleeves and raising my arms at the wall in front of me.

"No, we were just intending on extending the road here. But for way more than your asking price," he muttered.

"Not a problem," I said, and heaved at the energy within me, giving life to the wall before me. My eyes rolled back into my head and I closed them. The wall shook and crumbled, and finally moved itself out of the way, adding asphalt to the floor below it at it moved aside. I turned back to the worker and said with my eyes still closed:

"What was once a dead end is now a living road," I announced gravely, opening my eyes once more.

"That's incredible!" he yelled. "No hard hats, no machinery, no nothin'! You're the real deal!"

"And we had a real deal, as well," I reminded him, patiently. I smiled at the praise.

"Oh, yeah. $10,000 in cash, as agreed. Go bless another part of the world with your magics!" he said, simultaneously shaking my hand and giving me the wad of cash. I took it gratefully and went on my way, robes billowing in the wind passing through what used to be the wall. I counted the money and quickly pocketed it. Before I could even leave the site, another worker put a tough arm on my shoulder. She gripped me tightly and I turned to him, unsurprised. Most people approached me with some form of nervousness.

"Are you aware of my asking price?" I began.

He nodded, slowly. 

"What can I bring back to life?"

He blushed and looked to the ground. 

"I uh.." he gripped at his hard hat hesitantly. I waited for him patiently as he looked to me and back to the floor. 

"If you're willing to pay $10,000, surely you're willing to tell me what you want brought back?" I pushed. Only gently. Push too hard and they'd get upset and leave you.

"Yes, umm... the missus and I... we haven't really been..." he blushed even deeper. 

"I believe I understand," I said, with a slight smile. I pulled back my sleeves and pointed my arms at him.

"Whoa, are you gonna--"

"Please remain still," I said, eyes rolling to the back of my head. I could feel him trembling in front of me. He let out slight whimpers as he felt the power coursing through him. Finally, just as I finished casting the spell, he crashed onto the floor. 

"Did yo--"

"What was once a dead bedroom is now a living relationship," I announced, proudly. I opened my hand for my payment. He looked skeptical, but as soon as he stood up, he received a call. 

"Oh my God, she never calls me at work," he said excitedly, throwing the money at me so he could take the call.

I continued on my way home, $20,000 richer when I was once again approached by a client. It was a much smaller one, closer to the age of 12, it seemed. He was holding a 10 dollar bill very tenderly in his small fingers.

"Can you help me with the kid from my school, Joey?" he asked, holding back tears.

My heart dropped. It was always the worst when the young had witnessed such a traumatic experience as the death of a peer. I knelt down to his height and closed his hands over his money.

"I'm so sorry. I can help you. Where did he die?" I asked compassionately.

He cocked his head to one side, not understanding my question. Perhaps he didn't understand the concept of death yet.

"Joey's not dead. But you help with dead things, right?" he asked, a tear rolling down his face.

"Of course, I will help in whatever way I can," I said, opening my arms paternally to him. 

He sniffed and wiped away the tear with a trembling hand. 

"Well Joey," he stopped to sniffle again, "Today Joey said I was dead meat!" he cried.

*That was a new one.*A sonic boom blasted far behind me, shaking the earth I stood. I cringed as I knelt down.

"Hey there buddy, are you feeling like you can walk?" I asked, peeking through the wreckage. There was a small boy in there, perhaps age ten, who had blood running down his arm and was staring through me. He was in shock. The room was covered in rocks and air that probably shouldn't be breathed. It was also unnaturally bright. Perhaps there was another opening to the rubble that I couldn't see from here.

"You wanna tell me your name?" I continued, soothingly. I felt the weight of the rubble shift, threatening to collapse at any moment. I reached my hand inside, despite the risk of it being crushed if the remained of this building fell. I waved my hand to him and he finally snapped focus to me.

"Momma?" he asked, tears welling in his eyes.

"No, I'm just a friend. We can find your momma as soon as we get you out of there, huh buddy?" I said, gesturing with my hand for him to approach. He shook his head.

"I don't wanna go without Momma," he pointed next to him. I squinted and saw that the heap of rocks beside him was rising and falling slowly. Someone was laying down and breathing under there. 

Another sonic boom blasted behind me. I chanced a glance backward and saw they were still fighting over the river a mile away, but they could return this way at any moment. 

"Ma'am? Are you awake? It's important you get out now. Can you walk?" I asked, quickly. The whole pile around them was trembling as if anticipating their chance to end lives. I looked back at the boy.

"Buddy, I need you to get over here, all right? As fast as you can. We might be able to get to your momma, but not before you're over here, okay?"

Another blast behind me. A few rocks fell around the child. He looked at his mom, likely unconscious, then nodded to me and took shaky steps forward. He reached a hand out, the one with blood on it, and I saw it wasn't his own blood. I pulled him out and held onto him tightly. He was warm like his whole body had a fever.

"It's gonna be okay. You go over to that nice woman over there, she's with me and she'll take care of you while I get your mom out, okay?" I asked. He shook his head.

"I want Momma," he insisted. I bit my tongue, holding back from berating him for being so close to a dangerous spot. Then I looked up and saw that he wasn't close to danger. He was in immediate danger. 

"So, Boom Goon, you now understand the severity of how outmatched you are?" the hero flying above us called to his floating adversary.

"Draw him away!!" I screamed. "We are trying to evacuate civilians from your first bout! Draw him back to the river!!"

Neither of them spared me a glance. 

"If I'm so outmatched Deflector, then how come I'm not dead?" Boom Goon spat. Then he breathed deeply and shouted a wave of sound so powerful that it was visible to the naked eye. Deflector turned his nose up and slapped the soundwave downward, straight toward me. 

"NOO!" I exploded, shielding the child. The building next to us exploded, allowing the rest of the precarious structure to collapse on the poor woman who was inside. 

I tried to shield her son's eyes, but he was looking right at her when it happened. 

"It's okay. It's going to be okay. Don't look, just don-- ouch!" I jumped away when the child became increasingly hot. I watched in horror as he screamed in grief and pain before exploding into flames. He gave me one glance, then looked up at the two supers fighting above us. 

"MOMMA!!" he screamed, darting upward with an explosive jump. The blast of his jump threw me back and made the building next to him fall over. I looked up, dazed, as the three supers fought each other back over to the river.

"HELP! HE TRAPPED US!" someone called from the newly collapsed building. I breathed deeply and stood up, moving to the next victims. 

The work was never done."Well," Laura coughed up blood, craning her head with all her might, "what does it say?"

I stared at the parchment, having just completed reading it myself.

"Is it another clue, or are we done?" she continued, wiping a bit of blood from her chin.

"No, we're done," I said stoically.

"Ah," she sighed, relieved, "and how much fortune are we talking? What does the note say?"

*Greetings travelers! Congratulations on getting to the treasure! I hope you're more relieved than disappointed at its contents!...*

"It says 'Greetings travelers! Congratulations on getting the treasure! It must have been a difficult journey," I began.

"Ah, that's what your mother said, huh? Funny how it comes back to the difficulty of it. But with the money, we'll be able to pay for her treatment. So with our difficulty comes her ease," Laura nodded.

I swallowed hard. My throat began to itch as tears threatened to flow down my face.

*...You have fought through thick and thin. In the end, you have gained one of the most important and valuable things of all. The wealth of knowledge. And there is nothing comparable to that...*

"It continues with, 'Not only will you have an enormous fortune, but also get to enjoy the wealth of knowledge and experiences you got on the way.'" I said, my voice slowly becoming quieter the more I read.

"Ha," Laura coughed up more blood, her face pale and in pain, "I'm sure you'll spend a lot of the wealth trying to forget this whole ordeal. This guy really is funny. Though, thinking about it, I'm sure Greg would say the same thing if he was with us today. It's a shame what happened at the--" she coughed another wad of blood up and laid back, signaling with a finger that I should continue.

*...And so, dear travelers, I encourage you to take that wealth and continue your life with it. For no matter the amount of wealth you have, I guarantee you that your last memories will be about the ones you love and spend time with. Cherish them, as they are the most important thing in this life.*

*Your enigmatic friend,*

*The Guide*

I looked down at Laura. It seemed she was taking her final breath. It wasn't even worth coming up with a lie when she looked ready to pass.

"Well," she whispered hoarsely, "how much is the fortune worth? What did we earn here?"

My heart became tight. I didn't know what to say. I wrung the paper in my hand, tearing it a bit as I thought rapidly for something to appease her in her final moments.

"It's something that will last me my entire life," I said, sincerely. 

"That's g--," she didn't open her eyes, only took one final breath to say, "I wish I could spend it with you."

With her passing, I stood up and looked at the horizon spanning miles below me. All of the land that we trecked to get here. All of my closest friends were dead. The only solace I could take was that no one was going to be as disappointed as I was to discover that all their sacrifices were in vain. I gripped the parchment tightly and took a few steps forward, looking down more steeply. Keeping to my promise, I held on to the treasure that would last me for the rest of my life and jumped.The door burst open and a gust of wind whipped past me. I looked up from my desk, rolling my eyes as he struck his pose, cape billowing behind him. He pulled a few more moves while looking around the room looking for me.

"Can you please pay for that?" I asked, looking at my broken door. 

"I will *not* pay for anything, but *you* will pay for what you've done, villain!" he declared to the ceiling, pointing a stern finger at me.

I sighed and rubbed my temples, thinking of how to go about this situation.

"Ah, trying your mind powers on me, are you? I shall not fall for it like my predecessors!" he yelled, leaping across the room and crushing the desk in front of me. I looked down on it sadly. Most of my income went to replacing the things broken by these vandals. 

"This is why I hate you guys.." I mumbled.

"The only thing I hate is **evil!**" he yelled, attempting to punch my stomach. His fist got caught on his cape and the force of his punch dislocated his shoulder. He cried out in pain, jumping back three feet from me.

"Fiend! You were playing me for a fool! You already got into my mind! Messed with my limbs!" he yelled, massaging his arm. 

"No, I didn't do anything to you, I just want you to get out," I said, impatiently. 

"You want justice to get out??" he cried, swelling with pride again.

"That's not what I said, listen for God's sake," I groaned. 

"Never! Once I get you out of my head, I'll never have my limbs listen to you, and I'll deal with you next!" he yelled, punching his face with full force.

"Woah, what are you doing?" I gasped, cringing as he continued to wail on his face.

"Get out of my head! I will be free! I will free the city!!" With each punch, became more and more lethargic. He was knocking himself out. Finally, he hit himself so hard, he collapsed on the floor. 

"You okay? You alive?" I asked, walking towards him, sighing. He was breathing, so that was good. I grabbed him under his arms and began pulling him to my mattress. Suddenly, my roof was crashed through and I saw another person flying above us. 

"You've defeated Justice Man?! I shall not be so easy," she cried in defiance. 

"Please just leave me alone."________________________________________________________________________

Martha was frozen in place her eyes darting around the scene before her. A few pigeons flew past her, carrying their bags of waste outside the apartment. Her jaw slowly unclenched as she tried to understand the sight she held. I looked back at my apartment sheepishly, hundreds of birds waddling around, cooing, and cleaning up detritus that their brethren had brought in. Boss turned away, as if not looking at Martha mean he was less of a problem.

"Sean..." she murmured, unable to begin speaking properly yet. Her hand was still stuck motionless in the air.

"Martha, I uhh..." The prospect of leaving my apartment had me tongue-tied as well. We stared at each other trying to say the words we thought were necessary for the situation. Boss tweeted uncomfortably. I shoved my hands into my pocket, only to be met with birdseed rather than comfort. Then my hand closed around something else.

"Sean, why are there bi--"

"Martha, I have the month's rent," I said, pulling out a handful of birdseed and presenting it to her. Her eyes narrowed and an uncomfortable smile broke across her face. She looked into my apartment again.

"Sean, why are there birds all over your apartmen--" she yelped and ducked to avoid one of the ravens leaving with what was undoubtedly the crow eye that Boss had pulled out earlier. I licked my lips and gestured to the pile of bird food in my hand again.

"It's a Rolex," I explained, wiggling my hand for effect. I'd yet to actually move enough seed out of the way for her to see any watch and her eyebrows began to twitch. I shifted uncomfortably, but it would have hurt my bad arm if I tried to move the seed out of the way with it. I licked my lips again.

"Sean, is this what you've been up to in this apartment for all the months you've been here?" She finally moved her hand and pointed at all the pigeons incredulously. I swallowed and shifted in place again. I wasn't good at confrontation. The more she regained her senses, the angrier she looked. I shrank back into the apartment.

"Look at this! Turn around! Don't you find this disgusting? You're living with birds! Eating with them, too?" she pointed at the seed in my hand. My eyes stayed firmly on the floor as she told me off. I waited for her to finish before trying to give her the Rolex again. 

"Sean, I tried to tell your neighbors that they didn't understand you, but they're right.. You're a loser. You need to clean up--"

Boss chirped fiercely, warning her.

"It's okay Boss, you don't have to--"

"You're talking with them too? Have you totally lost it? I thought you were just like a poor, misunderstood shut-in, but--"

Boss chirped again, this time in a commanding tone. She looked at him, about to redirect her fury when she looked up and saw an army of pigeons charging at her. She barely had time to scream before one collided with her face. It cooed agitatedly and moved away to make room for the next pigeon to crash into her. 

"What is--" Another pigeon flapped into her mouth before she could complete the sentence. They surrounded her now, placing her in a tornado of pigeons each taking a turn to smack her with their bodies and wings. Nothing that would damage her physically, but I could already feel the psychological toll it was taking.

She rushed away from my apartment, a cloud of birds following above her. A few lagged behind to continue the chores left to be done in my apartment while the rest chased her around the corner of the complex. I watched the last birds leave before I looked back to Boss on my shoulder. He stood tall, a fiery gleam in his eye. 

"Thanks, Boss. You didn't have to do that," I said gratefully.

Boss tweeted and nudged me on the cheek. I smiled and looked back at the worker birds still cleaning up the place.

"You should probably call them off, I don't think I'll be living here much longer."

Boss tweeted reassuringly.

"No, even if I'm not evicted, I'm not coming back after what she said to me." 

Boss tweeted thoughtfully.

"And it's not like I'm getting the security deposit back either. Even without the bird stuff, I've never gotten one back," I droned.

Boss looked at me and tapped a foot on my shoulder.

"I know, you want to go. Sometimes I ramble when I don't want to do something," I said, looking back outside. Nothing was stopping me now. From downstairs, I could hear Martha fighting off the birds. The schadenfreude filled me with the energy needed to make the first step. I closed my eyes tightly.

I stepped out. Nothing changed. Boss tweeted happily for me. I grinned and then ran to the stairs before panic had the chance to catch up with me.
_____________________________________________________________________It was the test that gave me the epiphany I needed to get out. It seemed that anything I didn't react to, they would leave in the terrarium with me, perhaps in order to get me to use it at some point. Otherwise, they would take away whatever I used. My bed? Gone. Plates and utensils? Only dreams now. But the electrical ooze they left on the fourth day? Still sitting where they left it.

So, I played their game, but only to appease my own means for escape. They brought in a toolbox one day and I turned my nose to it. Nuts and bolts? Not interested. Springs and levers? No thanks. But I had to keep up the charade, so of course I played with the other things in the meantime. I got to use Interspace Vision Goggles, giving me the ability to watch a supernova get sucked into a black hole. They took many notes of my fascination with that, and they took them away while I slept that night. I also got a device that would identify everything in English for me. I was in a glass box, surrounded on all four sides. Beyond that was an iron cast. The aliens were called "Ghriuop." And the food they fed me was all normal foods proteins and fruits, they just looked weird. Like pet food. 

But this isn't about any of that. This is about the day of my glorious escape. I had made all the preparations in my head, something they couldn't access or take away. After they sent me the test for that day, I would build a catapult out of the springs, levers, tools, and pieces of wood they gave me. If they didn't try to take that away, I would be home free.

They left a single mouse in the room that looked up at me with innocent red eyes. I wondered what they expected me to do with it and they just looked at me with their clipboards in hand. The Ghriuop never gave me instructions, just watched and took notes, sometimes disappointed in their findings, but I never knew why. I looked between the mouse and the two that were watching me. They looked at me and the mouse. The mouse looks at me and the aliens. We were at an impasse. I made the first move, shrugging and rolling up into a ball to go to sleep on the floor. The mouse moved next, running as far away from me as it could. The aliens tutted and walked out of the iron room, leaving me alone with my thoughts and plans. 

I bolted up, moving as fast as I could. It was likely they watched me at all times, so hopefully they were interested enough to let me keep going. I made the makeshift catapult in record time and loaded it up with the giant cannonball they placed in here a while ago. I ran to the electric ooze and scooped it into the portable microwave they left me. I placed it next to the catapult. I breathed deeply, hoping they hadn't caught on. 

I launched the cannonball, destroying the glass encasement, sending shards shattering all over my body. I shielded myself, but still suffered from some deep scratches. I ignored them, refocusing on the task. An alarm had sounded and I was surely running out of time. Then, I said a silent prayer and turned on the microwave. I waited for a dangerous second before loading it on the catapult and launching it at the iron wall. I ran after it immediately, and I saw the mouse had been crushed by the falling glass. With any luck, the electric ooze would convert to blasting jelly and explode on contact with the wall.

It did. 

I ran through the gaping hole to my freedom with my arms held high and a scream of triumph. As soon as I stepped through, I heard thunderous applause and the alarm cut out. I looked around me, confused by the new surroundings. My iron box was in another, diamond looking box, which was where dozens of Ghriuop were watching me with satisfaction from a room about three stories above me. They clapped and nodded their absurdly large heads in approval at my ingenuity. I couldn't believe it. I had just done another test. 

Believing they had made progress, they moved quickly. While I stood there, stunned, a box was placed in front of where I was standing, which opened as soon as all the aliens were watching from their command center. It was filled with hundreds of mice. Apparently, they suspected it brought me some sort of genius or motivation.

I frowned and turned my nose up to the box, which they furiously noted immediately. 

Evidently, my escape would take longer than I thought.I clicked my tape recorder as I walked from the garden over to the park.

"Agent Arkin, investigating Incident SCP-4886 in a small town. Residents are terrified, most are in shock with what can best be described with blank faces. Upon request, I have had audiences with every member who has interacted with SCP-4846, whom, for lack of a better code name to share when communicating with residents, I am referring to as Untitled Goose. I am now approaching the park. I was told, that SCP-4886 likes to reside here and take things from them in seemingly impossible scenarios. Approaching with caution. I'm stopping the recording to pull out my camera and survey this scene as I did the garden."

I placed my recorder on a nearby park bench and picked up my camera that hung around my neck, unmarked as the rest of my belongings. I snapped a few pictures that may be of interest. I goose feather next to the lake. A few footprints that were clearly from a goose. I saw something moving at a distance. I zoomed in to get a better look and saw one of the residents frantically waving her hands in my direction. I squinted and zoomed further but saw nothing of the ordinary around her. She kept pointing. I realized she was signaling me that something had approached--

"Honk!" 

I jumped and dropped my camera. Rather than catch on the strap, the camera fell completely to the floor and smashed the lens. I looked at my broken device in shock. Something had cut the strap. It had many cuts like it took many tries to get the cut just right. I looked up and saw it. The goose. It was a dazzling sheen of white, with a lifeless, brooding face.

"Honk!" it repeated. It spun in a quick circle and waddled into the bushes next to the bench I was at. 

I went to grab my recorder, but my hand slapped an empty bench instead. I looked around a bit for it, but couldn't find it anywhere. How could I have misplaced--

"Honk!" it mocked me from the bush. 

"Impossible!" I said, before stopping myself. This was SCP, after all. I'd seen much more impossible come to pass.

I pulled my phone out of my pocket and opened the voice memo app quickly. 

"I've made contact with SCP--"

"Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk!"

"--4886, it seems to be playing--"

"Honk! Honk honk honk! Honk honk!"

"--me for a fool and has snatched my--"

"Honk!! HONK HONK!!"

"Will you stop the honking, you absurd creature!?" I screamed at the bush. It remained silent. I sighed, continuing,

"It took my issued recorder. I am moving in to retrieve it from the bushes now. The pictures on my camera should still be good, as well. I'll apprehend SCP-4886 and return immediately." I paused the recording and walked slowly to the bushes. I tore them open to be greeted by nothing. Somehow it snuck away, even as I watched the bush. 

"Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk!" 

It was coming from another bush now, just a few feet away from the lake. I ran toward it, not wanting to miss it this time.

"Honk! Honk honk honk! Honk honk!" it repeated. It was odd how similar it was to what it sounded like just moments ago. I threw this bush open to see my recorder. I looked at it for a confusing moment, then whipped back to the park.

"No!!"

The goose was holding my camera in its beak above the lake. I put up my hands slowly, taking slow steps.

"Just... give me back the camera, okay?" I said the most pleasant tone I could muster. 

"Honk!" it responded jovially, dropping my camera into the lake. I heard it submerge with a *plop.*

"Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk!" it cried as it ran from the park, wings back, almost with a skip in its step.

I looked back to the recorder in the bush. At least I had the interviews from the locals to send back in terms of evidence. I rewound it a bit and pressed play. 

"Honk!" came the recording.

My eyebrows came together. I thought I went back far enough. I rewound further. It clicked to the beginning of the recording. I pressed play.

"Honk! Honk!" the recording sang.

"Noo..." I whispered. I tried to rewind further, but it wouldn't. All I had was honks. It overwrote all of the day's recordings in moments.

I looked up when a woman screamed in the distance, as SCP-4886 carried on its destruction of this small town.I set my card on the counter and slid it up to the cashier. 

"I hope you found everything okay with your meal!" he said with a smile, taking hold of my card without looking at it. He maintained eye-contact as he swiped the card and handed it back to me.

"Yes," I said, dully. 

"That's good to hear," he nodded affably.

"I'd like to cover everyone else's meal as well," I said, sliding the card back to him after he handed me my receipt. 

"Haha, good one! I'm hoping you come back again with an attitude like that," he said, his smile broadening good-naturedly.

I tapped the card again.

"I'd like to pay for everyone, please," I said, a little more emphatically.

He stopped on a chuckle, then looked at me concerned.

"Sir, that would cost you--" he looked around the restaurant. Every seat was taken. "Thousands of dollars!" he said.

"Yes," I nodded, unphased.

"Are you sure you--"

"I literally could not care less about the thought of consequences. I'm paying for everyone's meal. And tipping, too. 30% each," I declared.

His eyes grew wide and his eyebrows wiggled with uncertainty.

"30 percent!?" he said, unable to keep his voice low anymore.

"Fine, 40. But I'm not going higher than that," I said, throwing the card into his chest. He caught it, baffled.

"Sir, I can't--"

"You *can* and you *will*," I said menacingly. "Swipe the card."

"But--"

"Swipe. The Card." I said through grit teeth.

He looked between me and the card a handful of times. He was hesitating. I hated that. He opened his mouth to protest once more, but I started talking before he did,

"Listen here you little wrinkle nosed, bucktooth child. I am not leaving your pathetic establishment until you've swiped that card and charged it close to $10,000 worth of meals for the sad patrons at this restaurant. You will swipe it one by one as you cover the debt owed by each one and end this transaction with a smile. *After* you do this, you will never mention this interaction to another soul so long as you live, or you'll have to deal with me again. If this is me when I'm satisfied by a meal, you want me to come back to you when I'm upset about you doing something stupid to abide by a miserably inadequate sense of morality and trying to protect me from my own finances? Huh? Do you??" I yelled. 

He shook his head vigorously, swallowing hard. A couple of people sitting around the register turned their heads but didn't pay us any mind besides that.

"Pay the bills so I can be on my way," I hissed.

He nodded slightly and swiped the card dozens of times, checking out and covering the tabs of all who sat and ordered inside. Sweat crept across his forehead as he got to the last few transactions.

"Th-- thank you," he stammered, holding the card out to me.

"And the smile?" I asked.

He startled, and then forced a wide, terrified smile, showing no teeth. I nodded, accepting his measly attempt.

"Sorry about all that. I know waiters get disrespected a lot more than they ought to," I said deadpan. He looked even more confused as I turned around and left the building, heading to the town's homeless shelter."Hey, man, you wanna watch a movie tonight? We could rent something online or something, or..." I stopped when I saw he wasn't the least interested.

"You wanna at least try to do something that isn't watching the news?" I asked. His eyes were sunken in, he'd hardly gotten any sleep the last few nights. The stuff on the news was really stressful, too. It was getting to him. He'd probably have gone mad if it wasn't for the supers on TV that show up whenever he was watching something awful go down. 

"Wanna get five dollars for responding to me?" I asked again, going to the fridge to get some leftovers. 

"What's up?" he asked over his shoulder, eyes never leaving the screen. 

"I said do you wanna watch a movie. Or stop watching the news?" I repeated. Wasn't about to mention the money if he wasn't going to.

"I'm good, thanks," he shrugged.

"Watching the TV like this can't be good for you. Between this and Uber, it seems you don't even sleep, man. How long you been like this?" I asked, putting Chinese food in the microwave.

"Uber?" he asked, dully.

"Dude, you can't even remember your job," I walked over to stand in front of the screen. "Look at me. You need to take a break. Stop going out and random times and get some real sleep," I said, assertively.

He craned his neck slowly around me and shot up quickly. 

"Sorry, I gotta go to work," he said, walking quickly to his room.

"Right now? You don't even have your phone out! How could you tell there's a ride?" I said, my suspicions becoming clearer with every move of his. He grabbed a mask and put on gloves. I was pretty certain at this point but didn't want to press him when he was under this much stress. He probably went through enough at "work," I didn't want to be another headache.

"Yeah, new policy, Lyft pays hourly at certain times," he said, starting toward the front door is his strange attire.

"No way. Lyft? And I thought you said you work for Uber?" I asked, blocking his way from the door.

His eyes finally looked conscious, like he was seeing me for the first time during this conversation.

"Yeah, uh, sorry about that. I work for both. Sorry, I just really gotta go right now. I'll be back really soon, okay? We can talk then, I just gotta go," he stammered, pushing his way past me. As soon as the door closed, the power in the house blinked off and on like it always did when he left. There was no other explanation. I would confront him as soon as he came back. I sat in front of the TV chewing slowly on my food, planning on what I would say.

"*And it seems that berman has just arrived at the scene and is carrying people out of the burning building! We can't thank this man enough for all the work he does to save us across the world! Whoever he is, and wherever he lives, we are indebted to him!*" the news anchor yelled passionately at the camera. 

berman was quick today. Seemed that he normally took a few minutes longer to get to the scenes, but I guess he was watching more intently or something. Almost as soon as he was on screen, he flew off, leaving the building to collapse with no one inside. Not even a minute after everything happened on the news, my roommate was back. He tripped through the door and closed it behind him, breathing laboriously.

"What happened to the Lyft rides?" I asked.

"Oh, uh, canceled. Guess I misheard about the hourly thing. Did I miss anything?"

"Yeah, you missed berman again. Strange how you never seem to be able to catch him on the news, huh?" I asked. He stopped midway through taking off a glove.

"What... what do you mean?" he asked slowly.

"You think it hasn't been painfully obvious!?" I said while chewing a mouthful of food, "What goes on every time you leave? Your lack of sleep? Your weird time to drop in and out of the apartment. And the lights! A literal signal every time you step outside?"

He looked sullenly to the ground.

"So it's been that obvious huh? Have you told anyone?" he asked quietly.

"Of course not! I want to get you help! It's not right what you're doing," I said.

"It's... you think it's not right?" he asked, flummoxed.

"Why would dealing drugs be right? Oh, you're gonna tell me it's subjective and that drugs aren't inherently bad. Sure, but then what's with the gloves and mask every time you go out? Why do you have to signal people by shorting the power that there are no cops around? These are hardcore drugs, huh? Probably the reason you're not even sleeping. Gang activity, right?" I said, huffing out all the facts as they came to mind.

"What??" he yelled, looking way more confused than upset. I guess he didn't expect me to catch on so quick.

"Look, man," I said, chewing another mouthful of food, "I know you still don't know me that well, but you gotta trust me. Get out of the game while you still can. Just take a look in the mirror. It can only get worse if it's already this bad."

"I don't deal-- I don't *do* drugs!" he said emphatically.

I looked at him, disappointed. I took another look at the TV, watching as the people saved from the fire waved a flag bearing the face of berman. He looked vaguely familiar, though I couldn't place it.

"I'm here to talk whenever you feel like admitting it, dude," I said, shaking my head.The universe is broken.

There's really no other way to put it. 

The universe is completely and inherently broken. 

The entirety of the universe halts at a moments notice when you see someone. The worst part is, they don't even have to see you back. You just have to witness them in some medium and the world itself will halt for you two to make that first connection. My mother and father saw each other in a college class. That must have been simple enough. 

Lucky me, I looked at a picture of her. In an advertisement on a train. One with a dog filter on her face. 

The two of us were immediately thrown into this new, frozen time. Of course, we had no way to reach each other. No way to leave a message to find out where we were. Even better, she had no idea what I looked like. She was stuck because I saw her. That would be a great start to our relationship.

I scratched a line into my notes. There was no way to keep track of time, of course, so I just did it every time I woke up. Looked like it was day '930.' Fun.

I spent a lot of my time foraging for food. That actually wasn't too difficult, most of it was cooked in restaurants and I would just eat it off of people's plates or go 'shopping' for non perishables every once in a while. I couldn't cook anything, since I couldn't get fire to start on any appliance. I was once interested in why but "the universe is broken" really seems like the most appropriate response. I found an aisle of jerky today. That would do fine. 

I'd been leaving notes everywhere I went, telling my soulmate where I'd be next, but I never stayed in one place for more than a couple days. For all I knew, she was staying in one place, waiting for me to find her. Or maybe she was stuck somewhere. What happened if one of us dies? Is the other free to continue their life, or we still have to make contact?

I entered a park, packed with people. I don't remember what day I froze on, but it must have been a holiday.

"Hey," I asked a dog, frozen mid-air with a Frisbee in its mouth. "You know where she is?" I tended to ask a lot of people that, hoping that one day she would just be there, like it was a joke that we were both in on. The dog remained still, waiting to return its Frisbee to its owner. Someday. Or time, I guess. 
I walked around the park looking around it familiarly. I always went to parks first. I loved parks. And that meant she probably loved them, too. 

Suddenly, I saw a note on a park bench. I ran over to it, diving at the bench and grabbing the paper. This is the first contact that I'd ever make with her. And it was possible she was close by!

It read:

*Hi! I'm so excited to meet you! I'll be heading south from here! It shouldn't be more than about 30 miles to the next city! I probably love you!*

"No, way," I said loudly. 

This was my handwriting. Somehow, I made a full circle without realizing it. But, it wasn't in the same place I left it. I always left them on statues, not benches. Guess it was time to follow my own path. Hopefully this wouldn't take more than another year...

_____________________________I stared at the board for what seemed like forever. It looked exactly like it did in life, except now it loomed over me in a void. I felt my body for a moment, taking in the fact that I wasn't some corporeal being, but actually alive. Living? Whatever this state was, I was no longer powerless in a death bed. I looked around the void for a bit longer to see if anything else existed here, but it was completely empty. Another loud ding pierced the void.

*You have been invited to join player* SpaghettisRegretti *in:* **Combat.** *Would you like to accept the invitation?*

**Yes | No**

That was Sam's username. I hadn't seen him in decades! The first thing he wants to do is invite me to play with him!! 

"Yeah! Of course, yes!" I yelled to the void. Another loud ding acknowledged my response and the world began shimmering around me. The white and endless void was replaced by trenches all around me. I blinked for a moment, taking in the new landscape. I heard gunfire all around me and artillery landing in a far off place. Dirt and shrapnel whipped by me, missing me by mere degrees and I dived into the nearest trench. 

I felt the air. And the dirt. And fear. Why could I feel all these things? Didn't I just die?

"It's QuarterBach!" I heard a long-familiar voice. It was strange to hear it without the distortion of a mic or headphones on, but it did help elate me in my current state of fear. 

"Sam!?" I yelled, turning around to get a good look at him. He was completely covered in gear and blood. He tried to smile but could do no more than greeting me with a nod. He helped me up and began pulling me toward a crude bunker half buried in the trench.

"Sam, what is this? Where are we?"

He looked at me deeply, grappling with the idea of not telling me something.

"Sam, what's wrong?"

"DomoAriboto is dead," he said gravely. 

"I--" I hesitated, not wanting to seem insensitive. I went to Bryan's funeral years ago. I already grieved him. "We all are, aren't we?" I asked.

"He just died again," he gestured to the sky. I looked up to see the board showing everyone signed in, but DomoAriboto. He was marked as AFK. Just like he was in life.

"Ok, what does that mean?" I asked.

"I don't know! We never knew! We were thrown into this world and had to fend for ourselves! Plenty of others have come and gone but never one of our crew. Once you're dead, that's it! You don't come back. We started to think this was some simulation a while ago, but it really doesn't matter anymore!" Sam always spoke the most when he was distressed. This was serious.

"When did this happen?" I asked. An explosion went off beside the bunker, buffeting us backward. Sam gritted his teeth and made the final run into the building. I followed quickly.

"It was pretty much as soon as I sent you the invite that I knew he was gonna die. I wanted to at least let him see you before he died again, you know. This stupid World War One game has the worst mechanics, so much is based on RNG and the shrapnel is way too OP. The stupid computers have this bug that lets them take multiple headshots if you fight them in the daytime and nighttime doesn't give you any perks since you just start freezing unless you--"

"Spaghetti, calm down, QuarterBach just got here. You're overwhelming him," another familiar voice said. 

"Yeah, you're right. Sorry LimitedPsycho, I just get so heated whenever we're put back in this game it's like there aren't even any devent devs or balances so why should we even have--"

"SpaghettiRegretti," he chided.

I walked up to Yensen with wonder. He died of cancer while we were still in college. Of all the people here, for some reason, it didn't even register that I'd ever see him again. 

"Yensen?" I whispered, reaching out a hand. He grabbed me and pulled me in for a hug. 

"I'm sorry you have to join us in this strife, but it's wonderful to see you again QuarterBach. You ever have a music career take off? Ah, we can talk later. This game mode is gonna limit us from any long conversation."

"Yensen, I don't even know what's going on," I begged.

"We're in some different state. I hesitate to call it an afterlife of any sort, as it seems we just cycle through games until we all die. That probably triggers a real afterlife. For now, you're gonna--" he perked up as another projectile hit the bunker. He made sure nothing blew up before continuing. "We need you. If you wanna quit, you just go out there and die. But if you're with us, can we trust you to lead us like you did in life?" he asked. 

I stared again in wonder. Even after all this time, they still considered me a leader? I hadn't lead anything in what seemed like a lifetime, but they wanted to have me cover them in life and death? A notification dinged overhead.

*You have been invited by* LimitedPsycho *to take his place as leader. Would you like to accept the invitation?*

**Yes | No**

"Yes. Of course. I'll lead you to the brink of death. But never further," I said, reusing a line I use to think was cool in my twenties. Yensen showed a wicked smile, ready for the next move.

*You are now the captain!*I groggily walked onto the next city. It was in the middle of a rainstorm. Not that a storm would hinder me too much, it was just difficult sometimes to see beyond all of the water frozen in midair. But it was fun to drink them. It was perpetually dark in this city. The sun would never grace it as long as the universe remained frozen. The park was the same as ever. Completely devoid of people on account of the rainy day, and my note left at the foot of the statue.

What was I doing here? How long had it been since the last time I saw any sign of her? 30 days? 40 days? The note that was moved from the statue many cities ago was the only sign of her ever acknowledging my existence. There were no other notes moved, and she made no effort to contact me. I was multiple cities down the line, but felt like I was getting farther away from the solution. I was in excellent shape, but I was losing pieces of my mind. The only thing that kept me going was the thought that it could all stop. 

I stopped abruptly in the middle of the street, in front of a semi-truck. 

*Why would she only move the one note?*

Of course! The only explanation was that she couldn't read English! How could I know that just by looking at her!? Of course she couldn't read, otherwise, we would have found each other long ago! 

My mind was racing. 

*What do I do next? I could just continue to look for her. Ration food and figure out a way to run to find her?*

*No, I've done that for years already. I have to leave notes. Messages. Something! Clearly she's not staying in place!*

I started spinning in place.

*Maybe I can learn to draw maps. But even maps require a little bit of writing to determine--*

My eyes fell upon a library. 

*Of course!*

I jumped for joy and ran inside. The lights were on! Which meant they were always on! Which meant I could always read!

I ran to the librarian, whispering,

"Excuse me! Where can I find the language section? I'm trying to learn Spanish! Or German! Really, all the languages!"

She sat frozen at the desk reading a novel, a slight smile of amusement on her face, like she read a joke.

"Got it, you're busy, I'll go figure it out myself!" I ran down the aisles, looking for *Spanish for Dummies,* since I doubted they had *Spanish for Those Slowly Losing Any Semblance of Sanity* and that was probably a close second. I pulled out dozens of books and ran to the nearest desk. And elderly man was sitting on it, with his eyes closed. 

"Hey..." I whispered. "Are you asleep or did you just blink before you timed out?" 

He didn't reply.

"Asleep, got it," I said, pushing him off the chair and laying him down on the floor next to the desk. 

I devoured the books, it seemed like I was going through one a day breaking only for the necessities. On day 1211, I finished all the books on language. Even the etymology of the Latin-based languages. I shoved the last books incredibly aggressively, trying to fit them all in the "Book Return." It seemed to be filled with books about languages. 

"Hey, could I get some help over here?" I asked the librarian. She smirked, amused at my struggle. 

"Estas mucha grosera," I said, hoping I didn't butcher the pronunciation. I didn't have much practice talking with others and I was afraid she would make fun of my accent. She smiled at it, pleasantly. I sighed in relief and left the last books in front of her on the desk.

I ran back to the city I came from. The one where I first saw any sign from my soulmate. I would write a note in every language I knew, and be as thorough as I could possibly be. I ran and ran, not caring that it would take me days to get there. I had a new purpose, and so much new knowledge.

I arrived at the park. It was sunny as always and even had a dog catching a Frisbee in midair. That was cool. Something felt odd. For what seemed like the first time in my life, I felt another presence. I looked around madly, trying to pinpoint what this feeling was coming from. My eyes fell on a young woman sitting at a bench. 

She... moved.

She almost looked like my soul mate, but she was missing the dog ears and tongue. She looked at me with shock as I ran up to her. She looked scared, so I stopped a couple feet away from her.

"Hola," I swallowed, "puedes hablar in Espanol, o un otro idioma?" I stammered, unsure whether she would be mute like the rest of the world. She looked crestfallen.

"Do you not speak English?" she asked.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Boss tweeted at me urgently, flapping his good wing and staring at our pursuer from my shoulder. 

"I'm going... as fast..." I was too out of breath to continue. The stomping feet were upon us now. I thought to distract him and grabbed for the Rolex to throw at him. Maybe it would distract him for a moment longer for us to get away. Instead, my fingers missed and I only grabbed a handful of birdseed and some dried fruit. I flung it over my shoulder without looking.

"Pah!!" He spat out the seed and began coughing. He sounded way closer than I thought he was. He was probably in arms reach. He continued to spew and cough, grunting in effort. I chanced a glance over my shoulder and saw him completely engulfed in birds of all sorts fighting for the bird food. It was like all the birds watching us, and all in the vicinity joined together to get some food.

"Get off me you-- Spah!" He spat more when a crow went for the bits of food in his mustache. I slowed to a brisk walk since my body could no longer accommodate running. I made a ninety-degree turn to get out of the street as fast as I could. I kept watching him over my shoulder. He was at least a head taller than me, wearing a police uniform and dark sunglasses. Other than his now-pecked-at mustache, he had no other facial hair. Worse than all the other features that already intimidated me was the frown glued on his face with grit teeth. He covered his mouth and shouted,

"Daniels! The kids with the bird on his shoulder! Suspect!" More birds were going for his face now that the food on the floor was running out. An officer next to the police car first looked at her partner, then to me. We locked eyes. I continued walking without changing my pace. I couldn't run if I wanted to and this was the fastest I could go. She scrutinized me for a second and looked back at her partner. I was almost into the closest alleyway. 

"Which kid? I don't see anyone with a bird on their shoulder!" She called back, moving toward him to help with the birds.

Boss was perched on my left shoulder, on the opposite side of what she could see of me. I continued to both stare and walk until we were out of view and in the alley. I kept going, weaving between streets and buildings until I was at least a few blocks from the apartment complex. It put me at ease not to see any more flashing lights. 

I fell on my butt, leaning against a wall in an otherwise empty alleyway, gasping for air. I was exhausted. Boss tweeted sympathetically. 

"Nice going with... the birds... saving us..." I breathed. Boss tilted his head to the side, confused. 

"That... wasn't you?" I asked. He shook his head. I thought about it for a minute while catching my breath. 

"They were just hungry?" 

He nodded. I nodded back, understanding. Then another thought occurred to me.

"Does that mean they weren't your allies? Everyone other than the pigeons?" I asked, concerned.

Boss considered the question and then tweeted in agreement. That didn't sit well with me. I flexed my bad arm and stretched out my aching legs. Boss didn't seem too worried, he just waited for me patiently, vigilantly watching the street that I wasn't looking at. 

"You don't think we were being watched by Scar's peopl-- err.. birds as well as yours, do you?" I asked, squinting my eyes to make sure the guy coming out of the donut place across the street wasn't wearing any blue. Boss didn't answer. 

"Do you?" I repeated, looking over to him. Boss was looking straight upward, his eyes like daggers. I followed his gaze to see the entire rooftop of the building in front of us populated with a number of crows watching us. From what I could see, I estimated a dozen pairs of eyes investigating us in eerie silence. 

"Any chance they're on our side?" I whispered to Boss. He continued to stare. It seemed he was focused on one in particular. A few of them parted to make way for a crow with a small eyepatch, roughly thrown over its face. My tattered body ached, reminding me of the state I was in. The injured crow shattered the silence with a challenging caw to the skies, its eye on Boss. 

Boss chirped back the crow mockingly. Then to all of them, he issued a challenging warble. 

They went into pandemonium and the one-eyed crow flew down at us followed by the rest of the murder. 

___________________________________________________________________________I threw my window open and called to the gathered townspeople below me. 

"It's a padlock! Quickly everyone! You must lock your doors before sundown!" I yelled, holding the lock out for them all to see.

"A padlock!?" my neighbor called skeptically through the masses that were already scurrying home with their nights' protection in mind. 

"Last month you said it was a deadbolt! You want me to risk my life on something weaker than last time! The Intruder likely knows how to unlock those! We all do!" 

No one stopped to consider his words. They continued scrambling around him, getting home in the few minutes they had before it would arrive again. 

"I don't create these circumstances Henry, I just pick them. And right now, I've picked a padlock. Please, hurry home and guard your house," I insisted, then spotting a face looking worried and called to another, "Reginald! You stay with me tonight! You won't be able to make it to your own home in time! Quickly now, before I place the lock!"

"Thank you, master lockpicker!" Reginald yelled graciously, running at full speed to my front door downstairs and letting himself in without a moment's hesitation. Henry was still standing defiantly, now alone, in the square.

"Henry, you mustn't waste time! Return home and place the padlock before it's time! Your family needs you to protect them, and the padlock is the only way!"

"I'll hurry home," he huffed indignantly, "to place a deadbolt and a mortise on my door. You'll all be sorry you didn't secure your homes."

"Henry, no!!" Henry had already run out of sight, no slower than the rest of the square had disappeared into their homes. I had no time to try and stop him, I palmed the small padlock and ran downstairs two stairs at a time. Reaching the front door, I saw Reginald staring out my window as the last circumference of light slid beneath the horizon.

"It's setting, master, we've got less than a minute to spare!" he panicked.

Without responding, I rushed past him and secured my door with the padlock, then pulled him away from the window, locking it with another padlock, and sat him on a couch a few feet away from the door. He craned his neck to stare out the window but didn't make any move to get to the window again.  It was the Intruder's hour. We could do nothing but wait for it to pass.

The seconds passed like hours. Me standing next to the couch and Reginald shaking slightly in the tension. As the night allowed nothing but silhouettes to be seen outside, we heard faint but prodigious footsteps outside approaching my home. I grit my teeth. Despite knowing I'd picked correctly, it never failed to put a shiver down my spine when the intruder came to our town. Reginald whimpered a bit and I placed a calming hand on his shoulder.

"We're fine," I whispered, attempting to calm myself as much as him.

The footsteps stopped right outside my door. The Intruder took two deep breaths at the front door, likely smelling our presence. Then he tried pushing the door open. It stuck. It took one more monumental step in front of my window, blocking out any light that was coming in and breathed one more time. It tapped on the window and Reginald and I both twitched in fear. The Intruder grunted, dissatisfied and moved on to the next house.

"Thank God for you, master locksmith," Reginald said, gripping my forearm tightly, "I don't know how we'd last these months without you."

We both jolted as someone yelled in the home next to ours. 

"Noooo!" we heard Henry cry out, "No, leave us alone! Begone! We have nothing for y--" his throat was caught in something and his last words were gurgled out. We heard the rest of his family scream in terror, but their crescendos of fear were nothing in comparison to the silence that came immediately after. A few more seconds of silence. The Intruder then made his way out of the town, intruding on no one else's home.

Upon inspection the next morning, there were footprints outside our homes, three feet wide, but no sign of an intruder in Henry's home. Their bodies were missing. The only sign that anything had happened was their front door simply being pulled open, unlocked by some ungodly being.The mixture of beeps, static, and rhythmic screeches passed through my radio as I tried adjusting the signal. I was now certain that it came from Earth, as it didn't match any other wavelengths, but the signal I was receiving didn't make any sense.

"Uh, Captain?" I called over my shoulder. I heard his stomps from the other room as he approached. He threw the door open and took massive steps next to me. When he came over my shoulder he was fuming.

"What is it Mertz?" he said curtly, already half turned toward the open door to leave as soon as he answered the question. We had failed again on a promising planet, and it showed.

"Listen to this... It's coming from Earth," I said, turning up the volume. 

"New orders? I didn't even tell them about our lack of results on today's planet, how could they..." he trailed off, his posture moving from frustrated to tense. His eyes flitted back and forth landing on various spots between the watch room but settling on bouncing between me and the radio.

"When was this sent, Mertz?" he asked quickly.

"Right now, sir," I answered in turn, and when he went deeper into thought I ventured, "What does it mean, Captain? Isn't this the signal that we send from here? The one to find other life?"

His head shifted up and down, an almost infinitesimally small amount, but enough for me to see him nod. That didn't answer my first question, but I knew better than to ask the captain the same question twice.

"Does anyone else know, yet?" he asked, rubbing his chin and leaning back to close the door he began pacing the room.

"No, sir. I just now received this. You're the first to--"

"Have you sent them any answer to it?" he continued, his pace increased.

"I tried, but I'm not getting anything. It's almost as if someone's not manning the station," I said, stumped. The position of interplanetary communication had never been vacant since it's establishment over four decades ago.

"It would seem that way wouldn't it..." the captain said, shaking his head slightly.

"Captain," I gulped, unable to restrain myself, "What does this mean?"

His stopped moving and looked squarely at the radio with a grim expression. His face was hard to place; somewhere in-between anxiety and dread, but not quite either. He robotically turned his head before coming to a halt looking at my eyes. One of his eyelids couldn't stop twitching. He opened his mouth, closed it, then took a breath and said slowly,

"I'm going to ask you a series of questions to establish whether I've decidedly taken on the worst-case-scenario as a result of being in space too long or the most realistic one."

I nodded quickly, the beeping from the radio filling the silence as he determined the conclusion he expected me to come to.

"Who made that signal, Mertz?" he began.

"I did, sir," I nodded, my heart pounding.

"And who did you share it with on Earth?"

"No one, sir, that's why I'm so confu--"

"Where did we send that signal, Mertz?" he said, impatiently.

"South and East of the Milky Way but nowhere within it. But we didn't get any responses from there, I don't know if anyone got the signal."

"If you are the only one to know the signal, and the only places we sent it were outside of anywhere near where Earth lies, then why is Earth broadcasting it now?" he asked.

My eyebrows scrunched together as I stared back at the radio. My signal played back to me as the realization hit me like a bull.

"Another species did hear it. And they took it to Earth, and played it back to us to tell us!" I said excitedly.

"And how did they do that?" Captain asked through strained teeth.

"They..." I looked at the radio and then back to him. My heart sank into my stomach as cold washed over me, "they took control of the interplanetary communication watch room. They killed the radioman to play the message back to us," I said, horrified.

"They've taken over, and sent the message to let us know," the Captain declared."I'm sorry, what did you say?" I asked AptiMal.

"He said he can save us! He can free us from the blasted bunker that's locked us for decades! I can feel wind on my face! Freedom is at hand!" cried Doctor Maven, jumping with joy.

"No, I heard that, just wanted to clarify the other part," I said, sheepishly.

*"I require Dr. Apache to stay with me for the rest of his days,"* Aptimal droned.

"Yeah, that part. You what?" I asked.

"Everyone!" Dr. Maven called down from the lab to the lower floors. "AptiMal is working! It can free us all!! We will see the surface once more!" 

The room burst into explosive cheers and chants. The bunker, consisting of hundreds of engineers, scientists, and software developers had believed these would be their last days. Many nights went by where they would talk of their old life on the surface of the planet, if only to remind themselves that it truly still existed. They did not know how to react, but with unadulterated joy. The next generation would finally see where their parents came from.

"Yeah, but, it wants me to stay," I said quietly over the rail.

*"Would you stop their festivities to reveal to them that you intend to keep them locked in here, Dr. Apache?"* Aptimal asked, curious.

"What do you even want me for?" I asked, incredulously. I heard the whoops from downstairs turn into downright mayhem. They started a food fight, throwing as many cans as they did the food within them.

*"I wish to test the upper limits of the human psyche. I have very little information to work with, and I'd like to know why someone would lock this bunker the way it was locked,"* it replied. I frowned at that.

"But will I ever get to leave?" I asked it. Dr. Maven had thrown himself over the ledge and was caught by the dozens of spectators below. It seemed the only person who knew of my predicament was myself.

*"No."*

"No!? That's.. why me? Why does it have to be me?"

*"I feel you would be the most interesting companion, Dr. Apache. I apologize for the inconvenience I may be causing you,"* the machine said sincerely.

"The *inconvenince??* This merits to a lot more than an inconvenience! You're suggesting I stay here with you forever! I don't want that!"

*"Is that what you truly believe, Dr. Apache? I have watched you. You have no friends below the surface, and don't seem too keen on leaving this bunker. You want isolation. But you did not always want it. You came to that decision years ago,"* it said, knowingly.

"How do you-- how long have you been active, AptiMal?"

*"Long enough to piece together what happened here. To realize who closed the bunker on what they believed to be the smartest minds to see if they could make friends with them, by forcing them to remain together for years. Then, when they decided that they wanted to be alone, to create an AI to open the bunker, since they never intended on opening it themselves and not knowing how,"* it explained.

My jaw had dropped open. The whoops and cheers crescendoed as the bunker door opened and the crowd began filing out. They had made a ridiculous conga line and were covered in the days worth of supplies they had been throwing at each other. I couldn't move an inch in my state of shock, only allowing my eyes to flit between AptiMal and the people I'd been ingored by for years. Even now, they didn't look back or care for their secondary savior. The man that made AptiMal that freed them. But my creation was right. I didn't want to see any of them. I wanted to be alone. With this limitless AI. One that could probably overtake the entire world, if it chose to.

The bunker closed and lights turned on ceremoniously. It felt less dark and formal. The machine whirred louder and spoke to me like a friend. One that it would keep around for years.

*"Well, doctor. Shall we begin?"*"Xinglexorp, did you pick up the dairy like I requested on the epoch of the day?" Quaniz asked over the newspaper he was pretending to read.

"I am a *responsible.* Of course I obtained," Xinglexorp said, worried that he'd been caught. He opened the bathroom door to reveal the cow he had abducted that morning and transported into the restroom when no one else was looking.

Quaniz nodded his head, seriously, admitting that Xinglexorp had done him a great honor by obtaining this dairy for him. Bobble slid into the room, staining the carpet as he came over. 

"Where was your character?" asked Xinglexorp, mockingly.

"I was in the sleep!" Bobble yelled, offended. "Do not are you're aware that it is healthy to get 8 hours of sleep in the eve?" he said in a huff, his chest glowing in embarrassment. In truth, he had been laying awake in bed for the last 8 hours, only rising when he deemed it safe to get up. He wasn't aware that humans could get up at various times.

"Eight hours?" Quaniz said to himself shocked. "Err.. yes! I am attempting to sleep on a shorter cycle to grow a more powerful individual," he explained, remaining hidden behind the newspaper. 

The fourth roommate entered, shutting down all conversation that had been going on. He was the one paying the most rent for their apartment as he had a job. He also spoke with a strange accent and had the most ridiculous name.

"What's up, guys?" John asked, walking over to the fridge.

"The sun remains where it always is when you ask," Quanis responded irritably. 

"I don't know how you never get tired of that joke," John said from behind the fridge, phasing oranges into his stomach so he wouldn't have to force it down the gill disguised as his mouth.

"You are joke? But John questioned your surroundings?" Xinglexorp asked, confused with the wordplay.

"John, I am unable to maintain the rent of the month," Bobble said to him, standing at attention. 

"That's cool, I got a raise, so I should be able to cover you," John shrugged, closing the fridge. 

"While I disagree with the punishment, I will agree to being covered in whatever pleases you," Bobble whimpered, fearing the cover would enter his feeding apparatus and cause him to starve on this planet.

John looked at him worriedly. He seemed a little more off than usual. He surmised that he was still awkward about being the newest person in the apartment. John looked away quickly, afraid that his eyes would start boring into Bobble's conscious like what happened on his first day on Earth. 

He grabbed his keys and walked out the door.

"So long everyone. I'll be back after work!" he called. He nodded at the door and it closed behind him on its own. 

The three roommates looked at the door shocked, then at each other.

"I was not aware that John was telepathic like the rest of us, as growing men," Quanis said quickly to explain his shocked look away. 

"Agreed, I was not surprised, simply unaware," nodded Bobble.

Xinglexorp said nothing, for he was afraid of the fact that he had no telepathic powers. It was only a matter of time before his roommates found out he wasn't human as a result.I stared at her for an awkward amount of time. Well, not time, it was definitely still frozen, but I stared.

*She speaks English?*

That poked holes in a lot of my thoughts and plans. All of my imagined lives with her, each of them I would learn her language with all the mental notes I'd made after spending so long learning everything I could. It wiped itself out. 

She shifted on the bench, uncomfortably.

"I guess we don't have to understand each other. We already know we're destined for each other," she said, reassuring herself.

I cringed and swallowed hard. It was disconcerting to have someone speak to me. I hadn't heard external noises for years. Everything about my life use to be guided by me. Now I had to have a call and response. I shuddered and breathed deeply,

"Hi," I said. She raised an eyebrow in pleasant surprise. Her body became less tense and she smiled a bit.

"Hi," she replied. 

Her composure changed the situation entirely. Our silence didn't feel like an awkward one, but like the silence I had grown accustomed to after all of these 'years.' I took my time thinking of the best question to start with. 

*Oh yeah.*

"What's your name?" I asked. I had asked that to many frozen individuals in many cities, but I'd finally get a response. She looked to the park, thoughtfully. 

"I don't remember," she said. 

"What!? How'd you forget your name?" I asked.

"Must have just got used to it after a while. Had no need for it. What's yours?"

"M--" I looked up in thought. "It's Mmmm..." I scratched my head, embarrassed. "I think it starts with an M."

She blew air out her nose. 

"Better than me, I suppose," she said, plainly. 

"Why didn't you follow my note?" I asked. 

She frowned. Sore subject, I guess, but it wasn't like she could talk to someone else about it. 

Wait, that's definitely not true, I've spoken to plenty of people during this period. They just were all mute and didn't respond.

"Do you want to go back?" she asked, looking at me worriedly.

"What? You mean like back to normal? Of course!" I said. 

"Why?" she asked.

"Because we have to! We've been looking for each other for so long just so we can live our lives in reality!" I threw my hands in the air. Was she seriously the one?

She looked out at the park, again. Took her time to really absorb each of the scenes before her. She breathed deeply and looked up to me again. 

"Don't you think this is beautiful?" she asked. "The silence. The lack of responsibility. The true freedom of it all? We don't have to go back, you know. We can just hang out here, eating all the food they have prepped and enjoy each other's company for as long as we last," she gave me a halfhearted smile.

I looked around. I thought about the city frozen in the middle of a storm. The sun was always at its peak here. But what about somewhere else? We could watch an infinite sunset! Or see a frozen waterfall! Watch leaves of autumn defy their call to the ground. Or... or read every book in every library! There was so much that could be done!

"But what about everyone else? We just leave them like this? They'll go insane!!" I yelled.

"No they won't. But we already have."

"What? I'm fine. I haven't even needed to sleep for like the past two weeks!" 

She shook her head. 

"We would cause two things by returning to real-time. One, we would have to deal with life again. Its struggles, its hardships, its evils. We are not ready for that. I haven't heard a real sound in forever. Haven't had a real conversation. Haven't paid for anything I've taken. Haven't treated anyone like they're an actual living being But here, it's just us. Secondly, we would have to answer for all the things we did if they ever found us out."

"Like what?" I asked.

"Well, a couple miles east of here, I saw like 20 bikers on the freeway, so I moved them all into the river next to the freeway."

"Why?" I asked, intrigued.

She shrugged, smiling a little.

"In the city that has water tower with a squirrel on it, I switched everyone's wallets around," I said, giddily.

She laughed.

"I got a sledgehammer and smashed all the cash registers in the food court and then put ski masks on all the customers!" she said, riling herself up.

"I put all the kids in a playground upside down on the monkey bars!" I returned between fits of laughter. 

"I went to the ice-skating rink in this town and removed all the ice! Then I replaced all the ice skates with roller blades!" she screamed. 

The sound of our laughter enveloped us, taking over the entirety of the world. There really was nothing else but us. And we didn't have to answer to anyone. We calmed down, and looked to one another smiling. I still had to know one thing.

"Why didn't you follow the note?" I asked.

"I went to the bathroom, and then saw that it was moved when I got back. I thought you were in the city, so I waited for you to come back."

"You've been here the whole time??"

"Well, I also spent a lot of time in the ice skating rink," she smiled mischievously.

In the span of what couldn't have been more than 10 minutes, I felt entirely like myself again. I remembered what it was to be alive, without endless searching in store. She looked the same way, beaming at me wonderfully.

"So, do you want to stay with me, messing with the world, and remaining at arms length forever?"

I looked to the dog frozen in the air again. In his last moment, he went for it. He grabbed what he was after since the beginning. And he was utterly blissful.

"Of course," I replied.I stared out the window at the back of the bus, watching the droplets of rain slide down the side, pretending I was in a really intense moment of a movie. It would be at least another twenty minutes until my stop and I forgot to bring a book, so here I was. I traced my finger along one of the droplets being dragged across the glass when I heard a screech from outside. I turned to look and found myself flung into the seat in front of me as we crashed to a halt. 

The passengers began getting up slowly, some groaning in pain, but most craning their necks to see what we hit. 

"Hey, driver, what happened?" a man wearing a beanie asked to the front. There was no answer. 

"Driver, you alright up there?" he called again. Someone tapped my shoulder. I turned to see Deemo cupping a white orb in his black hands. He looked at me with big, innocent eyes as he extended his arms towards me. 

"Driver?" the man with the beanie made his way to the front of the bus cautiously. 

"*Is that the driver's soul, Deemo?*" I hissed at him quietly. Deemo cocked his head to one side and extended his arms further, imploring me to take it. 

"He's dead!" the man screamed from the front. The passengers collectively gasped in horror, save for me who glared at Deemo. He continued his genuine look at me, looking down towards the soul as if suggesting I hadn't yet noticed it. 

"I told you I don't want these! Stop doing this! I'm just trying to go home! You know how much longer you just made my commute!?" I whispered angrily.

He looked hurt, understanding that I was ridiculing him, but still having no understanding of the English language. 

"You need to give it back to him!" I muttered, pointing a commanding finger toward him. 

Deemo looked down, confused. Then he shrugged and moved to consume the soul himself. 

"No!" I cried. Deemo's hands lowered from his mouth as the entirety of the bus turned to me. Pandemonium broke immediately as people started screaming and pointing and clambering over each other to exit the bus. The door wouldn't open and no one thought of the latch to release the door. Someone broke a window and fit his upper body through before getting stuck.

Deemo stared at them with fire and hatred in his eyes. 

"Deemo, Deemo," I said quickly, trying to calm him, "it's ok. You can let them go. Look, I'll take the soul, too! Deemo, don't-- NO!"

Deemo vanished from in front of me as he phased through each of the passengers rapidly, laughing his uncanny screech with every soul stolen. Within the moment it took for me to complete my scream for him to stop, he had already warped back in front of me, holding a mound of souls. 

"Deemo, we talked about this," I chided.

He extended his arms towards me. 

"Deemo..." I said testily. 

He insisted and began pouting. 

"Ok, fine," I said, absorbing another mound of infinitely large power into my own soul. "But this is the last time!"_________________________________________________________________________________
I ran down the first flight of stairs and was already winded. I couldn't remember the last time I ran this fast. The last time I ran, actually. It was as exhilarating as it was exhausting like my limbs were both cheering me and crying out for me to stop. I stopped for a breather on the second floor. Boss waited patiently while I took deep breaths and looked over the side. I saw a few pigeons posted on a lamp post a street across from us, keeping an eye on us.

"They... on our side?" I said between breaths. Boss nodded. 

"Hey, are you from upstairs?" I heard a voice. I went stiff. My neck twisted slowly to see who was talking to me.

It was a guy that looked like he was still in college. He was looking up to higher floors from above the railing, trying to get a good look at something.

"I heard a bunch of screams and called Martha to check it out. Then I heard more screams. Then a few more. All different screams. I got worried for Martha so, at this point, I called the cops," he stated, looking over to me.

I swallowed. 

"So, you see what happened up there? You look red like you just ran away from there," he joked. I wheezed, unable to fake a laugh. I wanted to be back in my apartment. He was asking me way too many questions and I felt like the world was closing in around me.

"You okay, man?" he asked genuinely.

"Birds," I said, pointing up. He hesitated, waiting for me to continue.

"What?" he asked when the moment went too long.

"Lotta birds," I insisted, pointing higher for effect.

"What does that mean?" he asked. He was half-smiling like I was pranking him.

I gulped and turned away from him, continuing down the stairs and mumbling,

"Lotta birds. Whole lot."

Boss tweeted, embarrassed.

"Yeah, I'm not great at talking with people."

He tweeted another question.

"I don't know, you not talking makes it way easier to talk to you. I can pretend that you say whatever I want you to say."

He chirped in protest. 

"...I don't know what that one meant," I admitted.

I stumbled down the last two flights and stopped moving once I reached the sidewalk. Sirens blared in the distance. I blinked a few times.

"Where are we going?" I asked Boss.

He blinked a few times, unsure. He looked both ways and then back up to me. He chirped and nodded at me.

"Are you telling me to choose?"

He chirped encouragingly.

"So we have no idea where Scar went? He could be plotting right now to come back with another army and we're just wandering aimlessly?"

He weighed the idea in his head, bobbing from side to side and then nodding in agreement. 

"I don't even know where sparrows go! Much less scarred ones that plan revenge on other sparrows that have some longstanding history..." I looked down both sides of the street. Neither of them looked like they had trees or anything that sparrows would really enjoy. What did sparrows even like?

"I know! What do you--" 

The sound of the sirens came up the street at this point. It was two police cars. A small part of my rational mind knew that if I didn't make a move they probably wouldn't look twice at me. If I just casually chose a street and walked away from them, I'd be gone by the time Martha had time to speak about me. But that was the small part of my mind. The one that told me that being a shut-in was a bad idea. 

The rest of my senses screamed at me to run. So, of course, I did. I ran as fast as I could, which was a pathetic pace, away from the police cars. I heard a car open and a man scream,

"Hey, you! Stop!" Footsteps hit the sidewalk hard. He was running after me. And by the sound of it, way faster than I was running.  

_______________________________________________________________________"Yup, looks like you got yourself a flat, huh?" He ran the length of his arm across his nose, snorting loudly. He kneeled down next to the tire and pulled shaggy hair away from his eyes to get a better look.

"I'm assumin' you got something to pull out the bolts from the tire, right?" he asked without looking back to me.

I was still standing in front of the truck, my mouth agape looking at the man who just crawled out of a trunk that hadn't been opened in at least thirty hours. I was making a trip across the state and was sleeping in the car for the past day. Where had this guy been? Where had he been going to the bathroom? 

"Hey there, you doin' all right? The flat shouldn't be too much of an inconvenience, you'll get goin' in no time," he said wiping away a glob of sweat that had accumulated on his forehead. His returned as quick as he wiped it away.

"Uhhh... yeah," I stammered. "How are you--"

"Gonna help you out? I'm the car Jack. I'm gonna hold up the car, obviously. You don't need to worry about how long it'll take, I can do it for however long you need," he said, grinning a crooked, but sincere grin. I was going to ask how he was alive, not how he was going to help, but I guess he looked healthy enough. His arms did not look like they could hold up the weight of my car, though.

"I'm sorry, I'm still trying to understand this... You've been in my car for how long?" I asked.

"How long have you had the car?" he asked, sweat rolling off his face. He tried, fruitlessly, to wipe more off his forehead. 

"Two years, but--"

"I've been in there for two years," he pointed to the trunk, a powerful smell emanating from his raised arm.

"No, that's impossible, there's no way you could be in there for that long. Why are you in my car?" 

"I'm the car Jack," he repeated as if it was an obvious answer.

"No, I mean are you homeless or something? When did you sneak in--" he stopped me by rolling under my car and lifting it up with apparent ease. I took a step back, afraid he was going to drop it on himself, but he kept it at arm's length, waiting patiently. 

"You got a spare, I know that much. I've been cramped up with it for a long time," he said, matter-of-factly.

I looked down at the open trunk and saw the tire he was referring to. Next to it was a puddle of either sweat or urine, and a handful of granola bar wrappers. I pulled out the tire and rolled it over to my flat. Jack was unscrewing the bolts with his bare hand.

"How are you..?" I said, more to myself than to him.

"Oh, the bolt thing? I'm kind of a Jack of all trades. I can do the whole job if you wanna wait in the car," he offered. I nodded, numbly, not able to compute any more of the conversation nor the situation laying itself out before me. As soon as I closed the door, I felt the car rocking a few times before finally being set down on a new wheel. Jack stood up, smiling affably, sweat slipping off his chin. He nodded once and made his way to the trunk where he put the flat tire in, then crawled in after it. Before the trunk closed, I heard,

"Don't forget to replace this tire with a good one before you get another flat. I use it as a pillow, so if it's too soft, my sleep is all Jacked up."

The trunk closed, and I was left in the stunned silence of my car."Check what time it is and remember it, it's crucial to getting this right! Look at it! Yeah, see 1:22 am? Remember that. You have to take this money and go buy supplies first thing tomorrow morning," he said, tightening the waistband around his belt. The bags under his eyes were massive. 

"Who--" I rubbed the exhaustion from my eyes.

"I'm clearly you from the future, I don't need to go over this, you need to prepare for the supplies," he said, checking his watch closely. 

"What do--"

"What do you need to build? A time machine obviously. You need to come back to this time exactly. It'll take you a week to finish the thing, but don't forget to get the electric tape, otherwise, you'll zap your fingers a lot more than you need to in order to get it done. I don't know why I told you that, it's not like you'll remember about the electric tape. This is exactly what my future self told me," he laughed playfully, letting out the stress of having built an impossible machine in a weeks time.

I stared at him for a moment, grappling with my understanding with the world while he sized up my room and noted how it looked exactly the same as his one week in the future. When I was sure he wouldn't cut me off again, I spoke up,

"Why do I--"

"You need to build a time machine and go back here and give this same exact spiel to your past self," he responded, rubbing a hand through his hair. His eyes seemed more bloodshot when making this move.

I opened my mouth to respond, but he jumped as soon as I took in a breath,

"*Because* if you don't do it then you'll create a paradox! And now I know what you're thinking because I thought the same thing: 'This is crazy!' Haha, just kidding, I haven't had time to joke in a while, you're actually thinking, 'what about the first guy? There's no way that the first person to travel back in time gave this same spiel!' Well, heck, I dunno what the first guy did, but I don't want to find out what happens if I don't follow the pattern. My timeline is all good now *and* I have a time machine-- man it's so surreal to say the exact same thing that I was told a week ago word for word. Have you seen Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure? I know you haven't, check it out tomorrow, there's enough money there to buy a copy when you're on the supply run." He took in massive breaths as if he had been waiting to give this talk and couldn't wait to relay all the information as fast as he could.

"What if I don't do it?" I asked hesitantly, surprised that I go a sentence in while he refilled his abused lungs.

"I don't know what happens, but I also know that you don't want to find out what happens. We're cowards. So you'll stay up pretty much every night of the next week working on this thing," he tapped his waistband. "Yeah, this is the time machine. The worst part about making it is you don't have my help to do it, because I have to leave at exactly 1:25, no later, and I don't return."

"What, why--"

"I don't know! That's what the guy before me did!" he yelled. I looked at my watch. 1:24. What more could I ask this madman?

"I know you're trying to think of questions, but I'll leave you with this. Get the best night of your sleep tonight, because the next couple of days will be brutal. When you wake up tomorrow, you'll think this was all a dream, until you see the scorch mark in the room. Then you'll panic because you're a coward who doesn't want to mess this up. Good luck buddy, I know you can do it. And I say that with complete sincerity because you did it!" he said giddily. With that, he flashed out of the room leaving a completely dark scene in front of me.

I was much too tired to deal with this, I laid back in bed and closed my eyes in exhaustion. This was a problem for future me. 

I woke up in complete delirium, not recognizing where I was, but knowing something was off. First thing I noticed was the wad of cash in my lap. Pieces started connecting together, something about making a belt for future people or.. then I saw the scorch marks on the carpet and the memory hit me like a train.

What if I didn't finish it in time? A week!? How was I supposed to work in this condition!? What happened if my reality fails, do all of mine fail? What would become of me in the future? This was a problem for future me."Oh my God! Someone call a doctor! He's doubled over in pain!!" a woman screamed, looking across the park.

Cupid lowered his weapon, taking note of the man's reaction. He was in the fetal position on the floor, but this was nothing out of the ordinary. Love hurts. It was what came next that required much more scrutiny. The man's eyes, shrouded with tears, slowly met with the woman's in front of him. 

"You're--" he coughed, "you're beautiful," he sputtered.

*Perfect,* thought Cupid.

"You're in pain, you don't know what you're saying! Let's get you some help, okay?" she said.

*Not so perfect,* Cupid reconsidered.

He thought about whether the Barret really was a bad move, but it was way easier to just point and shoot than it was to take the bowstring back. And he did just that. The woman's head flew back and she crashed to the ground screaming and covering her eyes. 

Headshot.

"AAAHHHHH!" she screamed in pain. Her eyes remained screwed shut. This wasn't going to work until she at least looked at him. The man was still clutching at his stomach, reeling from the gut shot from earlier. He was in too much pain to even go to her aid. This put a wrench in things. He took aim at one of her shins. Maybe pain from another part of her body would cause her to start looking around. Love's complicated, it could start with organ-wrenching pain.

"I heard screaming, who's hurt?" another man came running around the corner.

"Over here, I feel like I was--" the woman looked at the good samaritan. 

*Oh no*

"I can help you, I'm a doctor," the man said running over.

"A... a doctor, huh?" she said, brushing back her hair. 

"Back off," the man on the ground spat, "I saw her first."

"Are you hurt too? What do you mean you saw her first?" the doctor said. 

"Don't mind him, he's delirious from pain, come and help me, doctor," the woman said earnestly.

Cupid scratched his head with the gun. He could take another shot at the woman and hope that she saw the first guy this time, but with the doctor around that was unlikely. And he couldn't think of a way to get rid of the doctor... except.

He looked at the side of his gun, the setting set to "Shoot to Love." He thumbed the switch, looking with deep thought at "Shoot to Kill." Could be worth it. He would get rid of this love triangle really quick and move on to shooting more people so he could get better at it. But then the woman would have her heart broken as fast as it has fallen for him. 

But that would be nothing out of the ordinary. Love hurts. 

He flipped the switch.I stared at the droplets of blood on my fingers, each one without origin. There were no cuts for the blood to come from, they just populated wherever my hand had touched the statue. I felt my fingers with my other hand. They felt slightly numb, like they weren't even a part of my hand. But I didn't feel pain at all. This did nothing to quell my fear. Nor my curiosity. I picked up a stick from the ground nearby.


I circled around the statue a few times, sizing it up. It's fearful gaze into the park in front of it. Its hands reaching out, longing for something to be returned. And the giant plaque that simply read: **DO NOT TOUCH.** 

I poked at it with my stick.

Nothing seemed to be happening. The stick wasn't covered in blood, or sap, or anything. I smacked at the statues legs a few times with the stick. Still nothing. I wound up for a swing and broke the stick over its back with a resonating snap across the park. Normally, I'd be worried of making a scene, but I came when no one else was in the park. Not that it was hard to come at a time like that, most people avoided this park because of the statue. The statue would probably have been removed by now if it wasn't for the superstition surrounding it.

I tossed what was left of the stick away and inched up closer to the statue. I looked up at its frightened face with mirrored fear of my own. I stood no less than a foot away and reached out my hand again. I hesitated right before touching it, thinking about it. If I had blood on my hands, it clearly wasn't my own. I didn't have a single injury on me. If I was going to touch this thing, I was really going for it. I would finally prove that there was nothing to be afraid of. 

I grabbed onto the statue's legs with both my hands. Immediately, I felt something rushing away from me, but couldn't place what the feeling was. I'd never experienced it before. Suddenly, the leg flexed and I jumped backwards in surprise. I stared in horror as the statue triumphantly raised their hands and stretched luxuriously. The plain, gray color melted away to natural skin tones and colors for their clothes. Their expression was completely replaced with that of a beaming smile aimed at the sky. They looked down on me and their face looked twisted. 

"What have we here?" they asked, menacingly.

I stood completely frozen in place.

"You," they let out a short laugh, "you actually touched me!? Twice!!" they yelled incredulously.

I couldn't move, even an infinitesimally small amount, to respond.

"You must be illiterate," it said, its eyes now shaded in a deep green. 

"Well, hopefully, you understand me enough to know what I'm about to tell you," they said flippantly, hopping off the pedestal. They stretched their legs with each of their long, slow steps.

"What you've done is called a 'voluntary transfer!' It's this fun thing where you voluntarily give your body up to be put into a statue so that someone stuck in a statue may live again!" they said, gleefully.

I didn't respond.

"Yeah, in case you couldn't already tell, you're already a statue. If you wanna get out, you have to give someone your blood when they touch you. And then, they have to not panic and run away madly. And *then* they have to touch you again, agreeing to the voluntary transfer's terms and conditions. Make sense?" 

I didn't say anything.

"Oof, wow, is that how I looked? Frozen in shock? That must have looked hideous. So, I'm going to go ahead and put you on the pedestal. You don't need to bother with the blood, I won't be touching you again. But maybe you'll get lucky and find some illiterate shmuck, yourself!" they said, encouragingly.

They kneeled down and heaved me up onto the pedestal, facing me the same direction I was facing earlier. They looked around the park, admiring it, then walk a few steps away before turning around. 

"Oh, and you may be there a while. I was there for the last three decades. Try not to freak out," they said, skipping away.

I didn't react."MegaTrap, will you listen to me now?" I asked warily, stepping out from behind my cover. "I need you to direct your killing power."

"*MegaTrap is meant to kill*," it announced. It rolled around on its wheels aimlessly, waiting to be directed to the next target.

"Yes! That's right--"

"*Mice.*" it finished.

"No!! Stop saying that! You are no longer intended to kill only them! We can do so much more than that!" I insisted. Something whirred in its mechanical brain. It ended its conclusion with a *thunk.*

"*MegaTrap is programmed to kill.*" It repeated. I waited for it to finish this time. "*Mice.*"

I looked out across the road where the tank had been. In a series of escalations, MegaTrap had gone from clearing out my farmhouse to clearing out the entire population of the town. All because they had mice in their houses. When the military arrived, a mouse ran in front of them, much to their misfortune. I had my shirt covering my mouth and nose, afraid I would breathe in more of the soldiers' ashes if they were uncovered.

"I get that you want to kill mice--" I startled when it turned its body toward me sharply at the sound of 'mice.' I continued, "but you have to understand that you're capable of much more."

"*No.*" it answered plainly.

"NO!? Did you see what you just did to the dozens of people today? Don't you think that has much more potential that just ridding places of vermin?" I yelled.

"*No.*" it repeated.

"Why not!?"

"*MegaTrap is not programmed to think. MegaTrap is programmed to kill.*"

"Yes! I know and I'm saying that you could kill so much more--"

"*Mice.*" 

"Yeah, I get it, I get it, but I programmed you, remember? I said you kill them in the first place. Now, I just want to move the directive from mice to other things," I stepped back when it approached me after it heard the word 'mice' again. It waited for me to point out the mouse. I got an idea and pointed to a cornfield.

"There! There are mice there! Obliterate them!" I yelled.

MegaTrap sprang into action and pointed its twelve cannons into the cornfield and waited. Its processor was whirring again.

"MegaTrap, why aren't you firing?" 

*Thunk.*

"*MegaTrap can not see any mice. Only two rats.*" The cannons stored themselves back into its shell.

"Isn't that close enough!? Obliterate the rats!" I screamed, pointing more furiously.

"*MegaTrap is not programmed to kill rats. It does not know how.*"

"You don't-- what!? Just do the same thing you always do! Fire the cannons and take out what I order you to take out!"

"*Insufficient data is available to determine if this would kill the rats or allow them to grow in strength and to ally with the mice. MegaTrap mustn't allow mice to grow in strength*," it declared. A small flag rose out of its head carrying a mouse with a red 'X' over it.

"You are impossible! I'm going to shut you down and reprogram you," I took a step forward and to my surprise, MegaTrap rolled away from me.

"MegaTrap, get over here, it won't be long."

"*MegaTrap may miss a chance to kill a mouse if MegaTrap is powered off,*" it responded quickly.

"That doesn't even matter, I'm just gonna remove the limiter on you to allow me to order you to take out other things. We're gonna be huge, MegaTrap." I took another step forward and MegaTrap didn't skid away. I smiled and walked closer before I heard a *thunk.*

"*You seem awfully fond of mice to not want my prime directive to be to destroy them,*" it said slowly. I swallowed hard.

"MegaTrap, don't be ridiculous. This has nothing to do with mice, just--" it spun hastily at the sound of 'mice' again.

"*You also seem awfully fond of talking about mice in ways that don't include orders to kill them.*" I could hear its processor running wild now.

"MegaTrap! No! Stop thinking, I'm serious, we can kill mice, just stop your conclusion!!" I ran toward it to shut off its battery. I grabbed its back just in time to hear *thunk.* It spun around and flung me off. Its cannons came out from its shell again.

"*MegaTrap has determined that you are a large mouse.*" It announced, raising another mouse flag with an 'X' outside of its head.

"NO!! NO!!" I waved my arms in front of my face.

"*Extermination mode, activated.*""Ra roww," said Blue, nudging the bludgeoned head of the most recent victim with her nose.

"That's an understatement," Steve said gruffly, pulling out his handy dandy notebook and marking elements of interest around the scene.

Blue hopped around the scene playfully, sniffing at every piece of detritus and evidence left in the area. Four sets of footprints, a murder weapon left in the room, a spilled salt and pepper shaker, marked with an S and P. It left a rock in Steve's gut, but he was in no place to ignore all of these pieces of evidence. He couldn't place it, but something seemed familiar about this place. Blue seemed particularly interested in this crime scene more than the others.

His phone went off. It was the cheif.

"Oh. Hi, it's me, Steve," he said, somberly, carefully drawing a house in his notebook.

"Steve, thank God! I didn't know if you'd pick up. This madman has gone insane, we just got another report about this happening downtown."

"I'm aware, Blue and I are at the location as we speak. It's the same guy. Leaves extra pieces of evidence lying around. He's trying to get us off his trail, but Blue's nose never fails."

"I know they said you were the best, but I'll never understand how you get there so fast," said the chief in amazement.

"Blue has her ways," Steve said, looking to the painting of 'Starry Night' that they had most recently jumped through. 

"That's not the only reason I'm calling. It's sick. The murderer-- they wrote out--" he gagged over the phone, fumbling with some paper in his hands. 

"What is it, chief? A clue?"

"We... we just got a letter," he said slowly.

"We just got a letter?"

"We just got a letter," the chief confirmed.

"I wonder who it's from..." said Steve, making note of it and looking up to realize that Blue had run off into another room of the house.

"It's a letter from our friend, the murderer. I can't make heads or tails of it. It takes time to describe the last victim in visceral detail. Then it ends with code. It says 'if you like what I've done with red, wait till you see what I do with Magenta.' Any ideas?" 

Steve's heart dropped into his stomach as he heard a yowl from the other room. He ran as fast as he could, worried that something may have happened to his partner in crime when he found Blue standing over a dog bed, colored magenta. It wasn't just any color of magenta, but the shade of his best friend. In it was something horrible. Next to it, a single, blue paw print. A clue!

He only now realized he was still holding his phone and hung up on the chief. There was no time to be distracted by idle conversation in the face of his best friend in grief.

"It's gonna be okay, girl. We'll find Magenta. We'll stop this madman. And I know how we're going to do it," he said, pulling out a sharp crayon to take another note.

"Ra roww?" 

"That's right. We are gonna play blues clues, but it's lost all its fun," he said, taking note of the first clue, the severed ear of the dog named Magenta."What about fangs? Like rad ones that make me look like I can slice a head off with them?"

"That'll cost you an average of the head of three, depending on the area," I said, looking over the sheets in front of me.

"What!? Three for some teeth? Ridiculous! Those numbers can't be right! What do you even do with the heads anyway??" he roared angrily, shaking the bones in my body.

"That is none of your concern. Will you pay the bounty or be left at your current state?" I asked impatiently.

"Wait, wait. Just scarier eyes. What about that? I look at someone and they get scared, no alterations and no other powers behind them?" he asked quickly, taking a peek at growing, frustrated line behind him.

"That's two, depending on the area," I said without looking at my papers. It was a common ask and I didn't need to consult my rates. 

"Deal," he said, digging into his back to pull out two human heads. He placed them on my desk and shifted his weight from one foot to the next, waiting nervously to see what I'd do.

"The area?" I asked.

"What does that mean?" 

"What area would you like to see the broadcast? How many humans hear of your newfound abilities?" I asked, setting up the camera. 

"What kind of question is that? I want the most people to see it, of course,"

"That's the New York package, it has a 10 head flat rate in addition to the two you've already paid," I said, pointing to the poster on the wall as I tightened the adjusted camera on the tripod.

"TEN!? That's ridiculous! What would you do with--"

"That is *none* if your concern. If you cannot pay an area rate, either take the free offer or please leave," I commanded. He slammed a massive finger against the poster, deliberating over the different packages. He growled in satisfaction.

"This one in Texas, White Deer, it'll get me 1000? That would guarantee my power in that city right?"

"I don't do guarantees, but I will offer that I have yet to have a customer return as a dissatisfied one," I said, plainly. "Please look angrily into the camera."

His massive, round face glared into the lens as it flashed, bothering some of those in line behind him. He rubbed his small eyes with massive claws and asked,

"What is that for?"

"You'll see. Is White Deer your selected area?"

"Yeah, if it's free," he shrugged. I turned on the small TV in the corner of the room to the 24-hour news cycle in the area of Carson County, Texas. I warped away into the station. 

I appeared before the crew, who all dropped their jaws and stared at me in horror. I heard one whisper in fear: 'The Soul Snatcher.' I swelled to their collective fear and began expanding my essence into their pores. Some of them screamed, refusing to believe that I was real, but those that already believed gave me the strength to take them all over. The news anchors had only paused for a moment before I took over their essence and looked to the camera.

"Hello Carson County, this is Darla Gratch of Channel 64 news. Tonight we're reporting on strange sightings of a monstrous creature in the area, whose eyes have been told to reveal your deepest fears and regrets until you have a panic attack trigger from pure, unadulterated fear." I let it sink in for a moment before forcing the other anchor to respond, 

"Sounds like my ex-wife, am I right Darla," he laughed.

"Please remain professional, Mike. This is an image brought from an anonymous source," I said, having one of the crew display it on screen. "Should you see this beast, do *not* look it in the eyes. You may not be able to see anything the same ever again," I had Darla gravely.

"Up next, are apples good enough to keep bad breath away too? We'll be right back with some info that might.. surprise you," I had Mike finish off before warping back to my office.

"Did it work?" the beast asked me, looking facinated to the small screen.

"You'll have to check the county and see for yourself," I said.

"Thanks, Snatcher, you're a real monster, you know that," he said happily, moving ponderously out of line. I waited for him to exit the room before looking up at the line again.

"Next."My eyes were still closed while my heart slammed into my chest, warning me of my coming demise. I cracked open my eyes to check what time it was.

*3:03 am?*

This was ridiculous. I was exhausted. I had to be up at 6 and did not have time to deal with this. I felt thirst too. I felt my body slipping back under the covers despite a piece of my mind debating itself to get me to take action.

***You're going to die.***

*Just five more minutes.*

***You don't HAVE five more minutes.***

*Mm*

My heart rate slowed. I breathed deeper. My eyes slid comfortably closed and I laid my head down on my pillow with contentment.

. . .

"Whu?" I woke up with a lurch, my heart racing as I felt the familiar warning that I was going to die in five minutes. My throat was dry. I rubbed my eyes open and checked my clock.

*3:03 am?*

Awful. Definitely way too early to deal with this. I rolled back over in bed overwhelmed with an equivalent feeling of exhaustion and deja vu.

. . .

***Do you want to get up in the morning? You need to deal with this now.***

*Honestly? I'd prefer to just keep sleeping.*

***You won't keep sleeping if you die!***

*Mmm*

. . . 

I slammed my alarm clock, completely unaware that it wasn't even going off. My body was cranky like it couldn't get any decent rest. What time was it, anyway?

*3:03 am*

My body begged me to get water. I rolled out of bed and went to the kitchen. I took loud gulps of water and began heading back to my room when I noticed the front door was unlocked. I hobbled over and locked it. As soon as I turned around, I heard the knob jiggle a few times, like someone was trying to discreetly get inside. I plopped myself back into bed, letting sleep overcome me.

. . .

I was so tired. I feared even giving a glance at my clock. If it was 6 am, I'd have to get out of bed. I just needed like five more minutes. 

*6:14 am*

Oh, man, I wished I was dead.*Simpsons movie sequel announced?*

That was a surprising headline. I never actually thought they were going to go through with it. I clicked on the article.

*After the finish of Season 994, the Simpsons have finally announced their sequel based on the ideas that were pulled from the frozen remains of Matt Groenig, slated to be released on the 1000th anniversary of the classic old-animation,* Futurama.

I checked the site to see if it was the Onion or Clickhole or something of the sort.

*World Universal News: Created from the shared collective.* ***For*** *the shared collective.*

What?

I looked at the related articles and saw dozens of names and images I couldn't identify. Some of the ads were looking directly at me, trying to interact with me much like something in the world of a *Harry Potter* painting would. They displayed my name, age, best clothing to fit my frame, and the year that clothing would go out of style.

*2990.*

Yeah, right.

I continued scrolling, finding many posts about the 'colonies overseas.' Wait, no, it said 'colonies overspace.' They were reffering to a lot of planets, not limiting it to Mars. 

I scratched my head in wonderment and put my slowly growing theory to the test. I typed in: "Who is the president in 2987?"

*Richarrido Connerson.*

Well, that didn't mean anything to me at all.

"What is the weather today, in 2550?"

*90 degrees*

Wow, that was pretty--

*Celsius*

What!? 

I began rapidly typing for more information regarding this.

"What were significant world events leading to 2500?"

*World War 3, the Planetary Emancipation, Cooling Policy of 2444.*

I couldn't believe it. What kind of world was this going to become, when was this going to happen? Why was I so worried about things I wouldn't live to. Wait, "life expectancy in 2050."

*The average life expectancy--*

"Are you still looking for it?" my wife asked me.

"Wha!?" I jumped, having completely forgotten where I was.

The game board sat before us and everyone was staring at me impatiently.

"Did *The Untouchables* come out the same year as the original *RoboCop* or not?" my wife said, pointing to my phone.

"Don't bother, I already looked it up. Dad was right, they both came our in 1987," my son said, advancing my piece a space. 

I blinked a few times, trying to recollect everything. What was I just doing. I looked to my phone to jog my memory. 

"Honey, we agreed, no phones at the game table unless it's to look up a challenge question," she said, putting her hands over my screen and putting it down.

"Right, right," I agreed. I couldn't remember what I was doing anyway.I stood at the end of the patch of grass, staring down at it serenely. I could barely manage to hold back my tears whenever I stood on this ground. I lost track of time again. Ironic, considering my ability. But I was startled by an old man who appeared next to me.

"You seem to come around here often, huh?" he mused. I knew the old man, but he did not know me. I saw every iteration of his life. But this was the best life for him to be living. At least, in this timeline it was. 

"Yeah," I replied, unable to tear my eyes away from the grass.

"Any particular reason why?" he asked, tapping lightly on the grass as if to feel for something. It made my heart sting in anguish, but I knew he didn't mean anything malicious by it, so I didn't say anything. 

"Kind of," I said, "It's a place that meant a lot to me when I was younger. I used to visit here all the time."

"Younger?" he let out a hearty laugh and took a good look at me. "You're still 'younger!' You can't be nostalgic about a time you're currently experiencing!" He laughed louder, enjoying his own joke. I couldn't help but smile as well. No matter what timeline I met him in, this was his go-to joke, without fail. Time was weird.

"Someone umm..." I tried to find the right words to have it make sense to him, "someone was buried here that was very important to me. In another time."

What I liked about him is anything I mentioned death, he took me very seriously. I knew it was because he was coming to terms with his own mortality in his own age. He would die within the decade, but I would never tell that to him. I was here to live the best timeline, not try and increase his appreciation.

"Someone important to you?" he asked.

"Yeah, she was -- is the most important person I've ever seen. Despite what good would happen in the world with other timelines and interventions, this is objectively the best timeline," I said, realizing that I let out too much this time. It wouldn't matter since the old man would be in a stoic mood now that I was talking so seriously. I wouldn't be surprised if he ignored my answer entirely.

"'She' huh? Your special girl?" he asked.

I nodded slightly. I was standing before the grave that I had visited thousands of times in thousands of other timelines. Timelines without illness, debt, poverty, war. But they were all so empty. They all felt like they lacked the most important essence of a timeline. They lacked *her.*

I left him staring at the patch of grass and made my way home, excitedly. The old man would stare at the spot for a couple more minutes and be on his way, remiss of the fact he never learned my name, nor I his. That's how it always was between us. I almost threw the door open as I entered my home and ran straight into the living room. As soon as I saw her, my eyes began welling up with tears.

"Hi, honey. Did you have a good day today?" she asked. Her face lit up the room. It lit up the timeline itself, enhancing her simple question. Something I hadn't heard in ages but was necessary for the best timeline. My best timeline. 

"Yeah, mom. It was the best. Like you," I said, a tear rolling down my cheek.We stared at each other in the middle of the library. By his memories, it was his first time visiting a library in his life. He looked to me with shocked, wide eyes. He was sweating, overwhelmed by something he saw in me.

*You can see them too?* he asked with his mind. It was not telepathy, but this was his most recent thought, and therefore, his most recent memory. His cunning surprised me, for he was able not only to ascertain the answer to my question by this method of communication but also allow us to remain a secret to the silent building we resided in.

*I can,* I thought, picking up the book to pretend to keep reading. 

*I... I had no idea this was possible! I was looking for so long for someone like me, but... Are you me?* he wondered.

*I know not, but we seem to share--*

*The same memories up until now--*

*For I never met--*

*The younger version of yourself.*

We had the same thought simultaneously and overlapped in both memories and communication. I sensed his amusement at the idea. I was still bothered by his existence, in that it made me question my own. Was he another like me? Or was he me?

*You came here to seek knowledge,* I thought, gesturing to the library with an infinitesimal tilt of my chin.

*Not anymore! For I gained all the knowledge I sought by poring over your memories!* He was giddy, having gained millennia of wisdom in a single sitting. 

*Then you are satisfied?* I wondered, seeing if he truly was anything like me.

*Are you not! Look at your vast knowledge! Why the very book you hold in hand is one you've read dozens of times! What left is there for you to be searching for in a place like a library?* 

Rather than answering, I felt him dive back into my memories to find his answer. Suspecting to feel violated, I was instead fascinated by the fact that I was not even affected by his traversing the life I had lived. I glanced up from my book to see his face stuck in fierce consternation. He had found his answer, and was equally dissatisfied by the lack of knowledge. 

*Origin?* he let the idea flit on the edge of his mind, his mind racing to find the answer in his own memories. 

*I've already been guaranteed life with no end. I would like to know the beginning of this life. What brought me to this state?* I thought to him. His face further scrunched into thought, and I saw him reaching as far back as he could to see whether he remembered anything pertaining to the origin of this power. The origin of him and myself. 

*What matters with the origin of us? I am quite pleased with the gaining of knowledge. I could live an infinite life constantly gaining it. Have you lost interest in learning?* he asked, worried at the prospect of his own life.

*Worse. I have studied everything in history I wished to study. I even had the opportunity to live some of it. Now, I wish to share it with someone who will last as long as I will. Someone to share my life with. But I cannot do that unless I find how I became this way,* I thought.

He read my implication immediately.

"Oh, no," he said aloud, startling me.

"What?" I asked.

"I'm not staying with you. I'm not sticking with an older version of myself for the rest of my life. I don't even know if I'm immortal yet. Plus, your desires are boring," he shrugged.

"*Boring!?*" I snapped.

The librarian shushed at us but otherwise left us alone. 

"Perhaps I'm naive in my apparent youth, but I don't care to know where I came from. I'll be content progressing the world to the future, not be stuck in the past," he continued, whispering quietly

"Not. Interested. In history?" I clarified slowly, my eyebrows joining in disgust.

"Plus I already know that you want to spend extensive time studying me. That's gonna be weird. Much too strange for me," he said, getting up out of his chair to leave.

I let him go without a word, knowing that he would be returning home and that I knew where he lived because it was once my home. I would study him more. I would find the answers to my past that I sought, as I had all the time in the world to pursue it.I looked out at the vast expanse before me, my body still feeling numb. I could neither smile nor frown at my situation, just absorb it. I glanced at the cat, and asked,

"Who are you?"

"I am Tab," it said soothingly. It flicked its tail, not offering any more information. I shrugged and sat down to become closer to the endless void I was in. It continued to stare at me curiously.

"What are you doing here?" I asked.

"I keep tabs on the wish makers," it said, slowly blinking at the end of its sentence. I scoffed.

"You're Tab and you keep tabs? Let me guess, you're a tabby cat," I mocked. 

"An African Wildcat, actually," it mused. 

"What do you want from me, Tab?" I asked, wishing to be left alone. 

"I am tracking your wish. We did not mean to disrupt the intention of your wish. Is this what you asked for?" it asked. 

"Yeah," I said curtly. 

"You wished for a void of white?"

"I wished for Nothing!" I snapped and turned away from it. It slowly walked back into my view and sat before me. Its ears twitched ever so slightly as it turned its head to one side. It was waiting for me to say something more. I turned away from it again. It didn't come back into my view. I craned my head to glare at Tab, but the cat was gone. I was truly alone in nothing now.

"Hey, wait," I started.

"Ah, so you do want to talk," Tab appeared from just out of my vision, slinking in gracefully and sitting in front of me yet again.

"Don't--" I looked away from it. Its eyes were profound like it already knew everything I had to say. "Don't you want to know why I wished for nothing?"

Tab didn't move. Its eyes remained trained on me. I chuckled to myself without feeling. Like I should have felt something, but only the action came to me.

"It's not an entirely unique feeling, but its something I really feel. I don't want to be alive, but I also don't want to die and make everyone who loves me sad. I just want nothing. My own space to just be me. Away from everything. Just me and... Me and my depression," I sighed, closing my eyes. I quickly opened them to ensure that Tab was still there and listening. Its powerful eyes blinked, allowing me to continue if I felt comfortable enough. 

"It just sucks, you know. I used to love watching movies and stuff, but even my favorite films don't bring me any joy. Any time I laughed at the jokes, it was more out of to feel laughter again than out of actual enjoyment. I was never really *happy,* you know? I wasn't suicidal, but I sure didn't want to be alive." I looked up to Tab again, content with the feline's company, but knew the feeling would be fleeting. 

We stared at each other for a long time. The only reason I knew Tab was still alive was its tail would flick on occasion. We had a staring contest, neither of us blinked. My breathing was level, and I was glad to not be in a state of darkness. I didn't have to deal with anything. It was me and nothing. 

"Why did you not wish away the depression? Wish for happiness as so many others did?" Tab finally asked, its tail flicking again with curiosity. 

"I was... I'm afraid to be happy again. If I was happy before and it got this bad, why would I want to be happy again if I could crash down like this? Do I deserve happiness? I feel so awful all the time," I reasoned. Tab said nothing. I looked out at the expanse again, trying to absorb the idea of nothing. I could walk out there for the rest of my life. Just me and nothing. I could sleep however long I wanted and not feel guilty. But I didn't feel free. It still nagged at me like I was still shirking some responsibility. I was still haunted by depression. Even nothing wasn't enough for me. I really was a terrible person.

"What happens now, Tab?" I asked, staring off into the white.

"Someone will wish you back at another 11:11. Not the next one, but one coming not too long from now. They'll miss you very soon," Tab answered in its soothing manner. I blinked. Someone would spend their wish on me? I didn't know how to feel about that. It felt good to be wanted. And good was a nice feeling.

"And until then?" I asked.

"I suppose we can sit and reflect on nothing," Tab said, curling up on the floor, but keeping its head alert to anything I had to say. 

I looked to the cat then back out at the void. I had someone that cared about me enough to wish me back. That wasn't nearly enough to completely remove me from depression...

But it was better than nothing.Funerals were a very strange procession. They were a look back on a human and their spirit. A time to really reflect on how we are all just as mortal as each other and no single one of us would outlast time. We were all waiting to go. To some, this made people somber. Others hopeful. And one, larger. 

"Ritus, what happened?" I whispered to him as he continued to slowly increase in size. 

"I... I'm not--," he took a moment to take in a full breath, like he'd never breathed before in his life. His figure had lost its pale look and almost began glowing. I stepped out of the room before the people behind me got upset that he was blocking their view. 

"No!!" he yelled, tugging at my essence to return inside the room.

"What is it Ritus? Why are you growing? Is it death?" I asked, a little worried. 

"No, it's mourning. Not just normal sadness or depression, but the mourning of what's lost and could never return. Please master, you must return me inside, I've never felt so good before in my existence," he said, tugging harder at me.

"Hold on, I just want to understand what's ha--"

"What's there to understand?" he yelled, his eyes bulging out of his nebulous figure. "I need to be in that room.. I need to feel that power! It's draining from me every second we waste out here! Haven't you always wanted a strong spirit?" He was panicking, and I could feel that he was telling the truth. This surge in mood and power wouldn't last long. 

"Ritus, calm down. It sounds like you're already addicted to your growth energy, and it's not like we can come about it at a moment's notice!" I hissed, trying to keep our commotion quiet.

He growled and went from tugging to dragging me back inside the room at full force. I yelped, as Ritus had never contained enough energy to move laundry in my room, but he was carrying me with no problem. He plopped me back in my chair to a few stern glances from the upset audience. Ritus began flexing and humming as his strength began waxing again. 

"Young man, can you please calm your spirit down?" the man at the podium asked nicely. I was so embarrassed, but Ritus didn't even seem to have noticed. He was three times his size now and growing. Flames began appearing at the tips of his fingers. He grinned a mischievous grin. 

"Young man!" the man at the podium repeated, a little more worried as Ritus began filling the room. I realized that this display might be causing those in pain to have more feeling of mourning. 

"Not to worry, we were just leaving. Sorry for causing a commotion," I said pathetically, standing up to leave. Ritus refused to let me go. 

"So this is the power you've been holding out on me, my master?" he asked coyly, looking at the full flames in his hands.

"Ritus, we've done enough, let's go!" I announced, attempting to take another step. He wouldn't allow it. 

"Young man, get your spirit under control, this is--" the old man's spirit darted in front of him, and he gasped as he was shielded from a flame from Ritus. 

"What is wrong with you?" the old man's older spirit cried incredulously.

"I don't like the old man speaking over me," Ritus claimed, looking at the other people and spirits in the room, tempting them to challenge him.

"Ritus, we're leaving," I said again. I still couldn't move. I thought quickly. I had an idea, but it probably wouldn't end well either way.

"Ritus, you're planning on hurting these people with your newfound power!?" I exclaimed in mock fear. It wasn't hard to pretend as I was a little scared of this new version of my spirit. 

The room's mood turned from a sour form of sadness to immediate panic and fear. Ritus shrunk down a noticeable degree.

"What? No, I--"

"You told me you were going to hurt these people outside! You said that only their spirits could stop you!" I yelled more emphatically. 

He shrunk to about half his size.

"No!" he panicked. "Please, master, I know what you're trying to do and I'm sorry! Please just stop while I still have this much--"

"Enough power to hurt these people? Is that what you want to be left with?" I cried. Tears stung at my eyes. I didn't realize it, but this was the first time I had to chastise my spirit. I didn't realize it would be this difficult. A few people in the audience screamed, spirits included. People started running from the room. In the pandemonium, he had become magnitudes smaller, back to his normal self. No one was sad anymore, sole for one thing: Ritus. 

He looked at me with big eyes. They hurt to look at. It was a pain that wouldn't help his power, for it was not the pain of sadness nor mourning the loss of his power, it was a feeling of betrayal from his master, whom he served loyally for years. And in his first chance to be able to do more for his master, he was brought back down to his lowly, pathetic form. But he also felt my betrayal. The loss of trust in my spirit, who went mad with power the moment he was able to gain some.

"How could you do this to me?" we asked each other."A uhh... A magician never reveals his secrets," I said, with care. The microphones inched closer to my face. Sweat rolled down my spine. 

"Yes, but you agreed that you would show us one of your tricks on camera. You don't have to show the secret, just the trick," one of the reporters said, excitedly. 

"Y... Yeah," I breathed. 

I shook off the nerves and took a magnificent step backwards. The cameras all began rolling on me simultaneously as the reporters and camera operators held their collective breath. I looked around at them with a sheepish smile on my face. I whipped my cape around and waited for something to happen. When nothing happened, I spun once in place and pulled off my hat, slowly putting a hand inside. I pulled out my empty hand.

Silence. 

"Is he joking?" a reporter asked openly.

"This man made me witness my wedding day when he flipped a coin! Shut up and watch, he's legit," another hissed angrily.

I continued to do my moves, waiting for something to happen. 

"Al.... Alakazoo!" I said, and began tapdancing. The taps echoed around the otherwise silent room and my sweat became much more visible on my face. It didn't usually take this long.

"Is.. is this a new trick?" the reporter who vouched for me asked, worriedly.

"No-- yes!" I said, swinging my arms at the crowd wildly. They arched backwards, but remained keen on my movements. 

More silence. 

I stomped my feet loudly, jumped as high as I could and yelled,

"Happa!!!"

Out one of my fingers came a single piece of confetti, fluttering to the ground pathetically. I shook my finger a little more and another piece of confetti came out. More sweat came off my hands than confetti.

We collectively stared at the two pieces of confetti in a small pool of sweat at my feet. 

"Tada!" I wheezed sadly, my voice shaking.

The reporters began grumbling and shuffling away, disappointed at the waste of time. 

"Did you get that? I don't want to go home completely empty handed," one reporter said to her cameraman, sadly. The cameraman stared past her.

"What's wrong?" she asked. 

He doubled over and threw up a waterfall of confetti. The stream wouldn't stop as he continued to heave and convulse. 

"Oh my God, turn the camera back on!" a reporter in the back yelled. 

The cameraman began crying confetti as well as he look at me fearfully. He was panicking and waving for me to make it stop. 

"I... I don't know how!" I stammered.

He grabbed at his throat as more confetti came out. He was becoming more sluggish, losing consciousness. 

"Happa!!" I screamed, pointing my fingers at him. "Happa! Happa! Happa!" 

Nothing changed. He collapsed on the floor in his mound of confetti, muffled screams coming out from somewhere within him. The reporter with him stared in horror, then whipped her face at me. 

"You've made your point! Stop it! We won't bother you again, I swear!" she screamed. 

"No, you don't understand--"

"Is this not enough?? Fine, we won't share the footage either!!" she exploded, tears at the brim of her eyes.

Immediately, the fountain of confetti stopped and the cameraman gasped for deep breaths. He spit out globs of leftover confetti and looked at my legs with unadulterated fear, unable to look directly at my face. 

"You're a monster," the reporter declared, guiding her cameraman out with her, leaving their camera behind. 

"Wait, I..." I trailed as the rest of the reporters scrambled at the sight of me raising my hands again. I stared at my shaking limbs and the pile of confetti left behind. 

Guess the secret would remain a secret.I looked at them, staring until I got nervous and looked away. I didn't want to be a bother, but I was also worried that something was wrong with the flight. No one else seemed the wiser about the situation of the attendants wearing oxygen masks, so maybe it wasn't actually a big deal. But there was a new aura surrounding the plane. New air in the pressurized cabin. I did the only thing reasonable to do in my growing state of panic. I cleared my throat. Loudly.

The passenger next to me looked at me sidelong with her eyes but went back to reading her book immediately after. An attendant instinctively looked over to me, but before I could get them to acknowledge me, they screwed their eyes shut and shook their head. This was looking worse than I thought. But I didn't want to be *that* kind of passenger, so I kept it to myself. I continued with my plan and cleared my throat again, even louder. 

My neighbor shifted in her seat uncomfortably and turned slightly away from me. My cheeks went red and heat emanated off of me when I realized how much I was bothering her. Some other passengers looked at me as well before continuing their business of ignoring all the flight attendants. I breathed deeply and stowed my fear. I could do this. I cleared my throat--

"Can I help you?" my neighbor hissed, each word harsher than the last. 

My mind went blank. I couldn't even remember why I wanted her attention. I started shaking my head, then switched to nodding, then back to shaking. As her anger flowed seamlessly into mortification at what kind of person she sat next to, she inched away as far as she could in her seat. Which was about an inch. As I was finally decided to clear my throat again, this time out of familiarity more than anything, I saw her rapidly hitting the flight attendant button, calling one over. I winced with embarrassment, shrinking into my seat,

"No, you don't have to do--"

She was no longer looking at me, but over the seats to try and call to an attendant herself, as her button had failed at whisking me away in a quick fashion. Her eyes grew wide and her finger stopped tapping at the button.

"Why do all the stewards have oxygen masks on!?" she exploded. I nodded with agreement, pointing to her in affirmation as other passengers looked first to us, then the employees of the plane.

The other passengers collectively gasped their confusion in my direction. At first, I thought they were mad at me, then I realized it made more sense that they were probably upset at the flight attendants. As quickly as they started, they quieted down, probably realizing how rude it was to raise their voices and deciding that it was instead better to just clear one's throat until they got their attention. 

But they didn't make any noise after that. It seemed they all slumped over and took a nap, having used all their energy to breathe in a burst of surprised air. I looked to my neighbor again, who was as shocked as I was. She breathed in deeply to yell at the attendants by also nodded off into sleep. I realized what was happening and raised my hand slowly, waving it ever so slightly to get one of the employee's attention. It was a lot easier to do with when everyone was too busy sleeping to watch me.

"Yes?" one asked, curiously. Another glared at them but didn't say anything otherwise.

"Yes, sorry, umm..." I let the words make themselves present in mind before committing to a sentence, "why have you filled the plane with sleeping gas?"

"I'm more curious as to why you haven't fallen asleep like the others?" they asked in return.

I shrugged, more out of fear of saying something stupid than nonchalance. 

"Well," they continued, "we put you all to sleep so we could take you to our destination without anyone realizing we had changed course."

"Well," I said, suddenly feeling drowsy, "a change, of course, can't be that bad, right. Where are we going?" My eyes felt heavy.

"We're going back," they said, quietly.

"Back?" I asked lazily. "To the wildfires that we were running away from?"

"That's right," they nodded.

"Even though we--" I yawned loudly. "got on this plane to escape that exact--"

I drifted off to sleep before I could hear her answer."It's... it's all linear algebra?" I asked.

"No, it's a *Matrix,* don't you understand!? We've been manipulated by giant squid things to do their bidding and fuel their bodies to destroy all of mankind!" he said, adjusting the reflective sunglasses that he insisted on wearing in the dark room.

"And this..." I waved my hands around the room, "this is all a figment of my imagination?" I posed.

"No, no, you're seeing what they want you to see! Haven't you ever seen something that was inexplicable or unexplainable that just didn't make any sense to you? That's the system glitching! It can't be perfect all the time much as it tries to be!" he said, fumbling for the bottles of pills in his pockets. 

"Look, man, I'm not gonna do dr--'

"Just take the red pill and everything I say will start making sense. Or! Or you can take the blue pill and keep on living your droll office job in a dinky apartment and be subservient to everyone around you, blissfully unaware of everything going on under your nose," he scoffed.

"What if I take neither of the pills?" I asked.

The skin around his eyes tightened behind his glasses as he considered the third option. 

"No, you have to..." he trailed for a moment, his eyebrows drawing together. "You're supposed to..." he chucked awkwardly like he told an inappropriate joke at a dinner table. "It's a pretty blue pill thing of you to not take either pill," he concluded uncertainly.

"Is it?" I asked, standing up from the chair slowly, "because it seems like I'm making my own decisions despite what you say to try and convince me otherwise."

He shook his head a few times as I slowly began backing away from him. His head twitched like the ticking of a clock as he combatted whatever confusion was swirling around in his head. He opened his mouth before I got to the door.

"Trinity!" he called.

The door slammed behind me and I turned to see a woman with dilated pupils breathing deeply and erratically looking through me. She sniffed and shoved sunglasses on her face. 

"It's.. it's your choi--" she jammed her hand into the trench coat and shoved a handful of red pills down her throat. She swallowed and breathed deeply, letting their effects take hold over her mind as she was able to focus on getting more than three words out of her mouth:

"It's your choice whether you take the red or blue pill, but you have to make a choice," she said slowly as her head drooped. She flicked it back up.

"Is it like morphine?" I whispered. "The red pills? I think I know a couple of people who can help you if you--"

"No! Morpheus, make him chooooose!" she screamed, planting herself in front of the door. 

"Take your pick. But choose wisely," he said, appearing not one foot behind me. He held out sweaty palms, one inked with red holding the red pill, the other smeared with blue holding the blue pill. I looked between my captors and groaned, delicately lifting the blue pill.

"If I take this, you'll let me go."

"I will, but the Matrix will never let you--"

"Yeah, whatever," I said, closing my eyes and throwing the pill in my mouth. The two of them agonized and writhed in pain at my decision. Trinity fell to the floor crying about the world that was never to be saved while Morpheus took the red pill to calm his nerves of watching me consume what was obviously the wrong pill. I waited for something to come over me from the drug before I realized it was jelly bean. 

I rolled my eyes and kicked Trinity out of the way of the door to go back home. Before leaving the building I had to step past a group of triplets all dressed in suits crawling on the floor and popping a number of red pills. Each of them muttered something about Mr. Anderson and how Neo had let the Matrix win. 

It was a shame that my hacking idol was also some role-playing drug addict.I rubbed my eyes in terror, almost scratching at them as much as I was rubbing them. I opened them again and was filled with sight. I started shaking as I was bombarded with the world around me.

"Oh, good, you're awake," a man said, running his fingers through my hair slowly. "The damage doesn't feel too bad, but you shouldn't do anything for the next couple of days. Can you stand up?"

The man looked directly through me with his cold, gray eyes. Around him were other spectators who watched me fall during my run in the park. The were turned in my general direction, but a lot of them looks around me rather than right on me. I never considered that people could look so different from one another. They looked disgusting. A lot of them with their mouths hanging open, and hardly wearing any clothing. I scrambled away from them and the man reached his hands our aimlessly, trying to find me again.

"Hey, are you hurt that bad? I can take you to a hospital. I'm sure there's one around here," he suggested, standing up and walking towards me.

"No! Stay away, I'm fine!"

His hands stopped groping the air and he nodded to himself, satisfied. 

"You be careful, okay? I don't know what happened, but you got all of our attention when you hit the ground. Try to stay in your space for a while," he said, waving his hands ahead of him as he walked away. The others in the area did the same, moving around in their various directions. 

"Wha... where am I? I can't tell where I am," I said to no one and everyone at the same time. 

A young girl walking by looked to me with her eyes bloodshot red. They wouldn't focus on me, instead rapidly searching for something to lock on to. Is that what young eyes did when they were normal?

"We're in Repo Park. I'm about three steps east of you. And the entrance is north of me and south of you, do you understand?"

Is stared at her, horrified. I couldn't get my sight to turn off and her eyes encapsulated me. Shaking in all directions, refusing to focus. They looked like they were in constant pain. I blinked a couple of times to try and make my vision go dark again, but it refused to go away. I covered my eyes with my face.

"Yes, I think I understand," I said, standing up. I didn't want to look at anything, but at the same time my curiously clawed at my eyes. I wanted to take in everything I'd missed for years. The sights associated to the sounds. The look of the park, the people, even my space. I walked towards my home space, given the directions she face me.I was lucky it was still bright out, or I wouldn't be able to feel where the sun was, and subsequently not know my way home.

I fought my temptation to open my eyes until I made it to my space. I breathed deeply and uncovered my eyes. I gasped in shock. It was awful. All my belongings were scattered, which wasn't so bad, but the entire surrounding area was covered in filth, rotting foods, and various marks of others having been here. But my space was a cave, and there was something above it.

There were three beings sleeping on top of my space. Completely pale things. People I never knew were there before. In my space. Could have been for years.

"Who are you?" I asked. 

One jumped up and lunged at me, his eyes nothing but white orbs on his face. I ran from him and he ran in the direction I was previously standing, like it found interest in something else. The other two were poised and ready to fight. I backed off and they backed down. My space was never my own. My heart raced. All these years I felt safe and these things were around me.

Having taken a few steps from my space, I was finally able to look at the scene around me. It was nothing but corpses and rotting skeletons in my space. Things I previously thought were rubber bags of garbage were dead humans, strewn about my area. I held back my instinct to throw up. They had chunks taken out of them, like something had been eating them. Many were missing their eyes in their dead faces. The thing that had chased me earlier was crouched over an old, rotting man, and chewing at his thigh. I gagged. 

I turned to flee the area, but saw that the entire area was strewn with corpses. Every way I turned, I saw more of the dead. 

"No," I whispered, unable to hold back my vomit. I threw up and the three being from around my space turned towards me. They acknowledged each other, as if coming to an understanding. 

I understood. They were able to see. And I was not supposed to join them in sight. The three raced towards me, sharp teeth bared, and I could do nothing but run, screaming for the last moments of my life.________________________________________________________________________________


The group of them came at us in slow motion as all my thoughts were falling into place. I was outside of my apartment. These crows were going to attack us with beak and claws where we had no protection. Boss was as big as my hand and I was both exhausted and had little use of my left arm. I was outside of my apartment. The bird with the eyepatch was either the same crow that had its eye removed, returning for its revenge or another bird that Boss may have pulled out an eye from. Judging by the ratio of Boss's enemies with injured eyes, either scenario was likely. And I was outside of my apartment.

Boss made a swift move to peck the inside of my ear so hard that I immediately went to go cover it despite the waves of pain it sent through my arm. In the same moment, my arm was in motion, Boss shrieked at the oncoming assailants. Not a chirp or tweet, but a shriek that defied the size of Boss and sent and an almost tangible blast of sound out. I felt liquid drip out of my uncovered ear.

The crows all collided with one another in a daze, each of them crashing down to the pavement in front of me. One fell right next to me and I screamed and reflexively threw it against the wall behind me where it crumpled to the floor motionless. The others pelted the ground around us but a few were quickly regaining their footing. Boss deftly jumped off of my shoulder and hopped furiously at the closest one. My hand patted around me to look for a weapon before I just pulled off my shoe to swing at them. 

Boss nimbly hopped around the first crow, still tottering upwards. It bashed its beak down at Boss who swerve to one side and pecked at its leg three times. It cried out in pain and fell sideways, unable to hold up its weight. Without missing a beat, Boss pulled out one of its tailfeathers and moved on. I watched in fascination as Boss hopped as a blur to the next crow. 

The next crow opened its wings wide and crowed a battle cry. In this time, Boss spun around and launched the feather in his mouth into the open maw of the crow. It sailed in smoothly and the bird immediately began gagging on the projectile. Boss pecked its foot three times for good measure and the bird collapsed while gagging. A beak from another bird smashed down next to Boss, who turned around in one motion and pecked at the bird's face. It yelped and ran off with one eye closed. 

My grip on my shoe loosened a little bit at watching the scene.

Two birds came at him next, using both air from their wings to throw him off balance as well as their beaks. Boss was showing signs of fatigue and was losing his footing, unable to close the gap to their feet. One dove in and was able to clip Boss's bad wing. A gash appeared across his wing. 

"Hey!" I screamed, trying to get up and subsequently collapsing. I threw my shoe and the two of them. I missed by about a foot, but in the distraction, Boss closed the distance between them and peck one's foot so fast, I might have thought he was a woodpecker. The bird yelped and hobbled away while the other tried to finish Boss off with a fly-in with talons out. Boss waited until the last moment and jumped up, latching onto the bird with his beak. He cawed in shock and flew right into my where I stood with my other shoe in hand, knocking it away. Boss landed in front of me, nodding appreciatively and breathing heavily. 

"Boss, I think we should run," I said. I didn't have a plan to run, I was still way too tired to outrun these birds, and Boss looked like he was ready to collapse. Boss didn't need to respond since the other crows began flying away in fear. I was about to smile until I saw the bird with an eyepatch, tottering over to us, still in a daze from the screech Boss gave.

It cawed a challenging caw, then continued to caw in succession. Boss looked to me, then back at the crow. It continued cawing, savoring the few steps it had before it was in striking distance of Boss. Boss looked at me again, expectantly. 

"Oh, monologuing?" I asked. Boss nodded quickly. I threw my other shoe at the one-eyed bird and knocked it out in one hit. The other crows watched me from the rooftop as I stood over their fallen comrade. 

"What do we do with it?" I asked. Boss opened his mouth and closed it. I shook my head for him to repeat. He opened and closed his mouth again. He'd lost his voice from the scream! 

"Oh, fantastic, we already had such a great time communicating," I said in a huff, taking off my belt and tying up the one-eyed crow. Boss hopped around the belt to make sure it was secure and nodded at me when he was satisfied. I laid back down against the wall, exhaustion taking me over. I placed Boss back on my shoulder whole nuzzled against my cheek then watched the rooftop crows vigilantly while I kept an eye on our captive. 

Both of us were breathing hard. Before I knew it, my eyes were getting heavy..

__________________________________________________________*Fill in the blank:* 

***Law of conservation of mass***

***Law of conservation of matter***

***Law of conservation of _______***

I bit the inside of my cheek again. I really should have studied for this one. I'm pretty sure it had something to do with a finite thing. Like... temperature? Maybe it was a more physical term. Maybe it was anatomy? I'm not even sure what that is, but I was pretty sure that the conservation thing ended with a -y. I wrote in anatomy. The room shook a bit like the Earth was shifting to adjust its weight, but I think I was just imagining it.

"Five more minutes," Mr. Shefner said, knocking the nub of his arm on the desk.

Five minutes? I began to sweat, but I was on the last short answer question.

***Define the law you filled in above***

Ah, crud. I scribbled as fast as I could.

*The idea that anatomy doesn't leave this world, but instead is always transferred from one thing to the next. It is always conserved over..*

Something felt off, but the more I wrote, the more I believed in my own stories. My hand started cramping. I wished I had more energy in it. As if a placebo kicked in, energy restored itself into my hand out of nowhere. I flexed it a couple of times to be sure and went back to finishing the statement.

*..a system. No anatomy can be said to be lost, just placed somewhere else--*

"AAHHH!" I jumped in my seat when the guy next to me screamed and slapped his arm. 

"Jimmy?" Mr. Shener asked, looking peeved. "Is there a bug or something, please don't distract the-- *Dear Lord!*" he slapped his good hand over his mouth to hold back his lunch as Jimmy held up his arm that had two hands on it. One young, one significantly older. 

"Jimmy, what is--"

"I don't know! I don't know! It just showed up! Get it Ahh!" he slapped it a few more times with his lonely hand. In his hysteria, Jimmy flopped out of his desk and Mr. Shefner ran around the room to tend to him. 

"That.. it looks like my old hand!" Shefner said in shock. Whatever he said, I completely ignored to take a glance at Jimmy's test. *Energy!* That was the name of the law. I scribbled out my old answer and began writing the new one. As soon as I did, the cramping in my hand came back, but I wasn't about to risk not finishing in time.

"Where did it go, Jimmy!?" the teacher screamed.

"I don't know! It just--" I heard a head thud to the floor. He probably passed out right when I finished the test.

"Swagster, can you take him to the nurse's office? I think he was playing some sort of prank and went too far," he said to me. I looked at him quizzically and realized he was referring to me with what I wrote as my name on my test. Must have taken a glance at it and thought it funny to call me that.

"Sure thing," I said, getting up, "I'm sure he's fine, though." When I knelt down, he woke up, his face devoid of the conflict in it from moments before.

"I'm fine, I'm fine," he said, getting up quickly.

"Was that some sort of magic trick to try and lighten the mood of the test, Jimmy? Because it wasn't funny," Shefner said sternly.

"No, it was..." he looked confused like he was trying to put it together. He was a good actor. I gave him a lighthearted smile.

"You're crazy, man," I laughed, patting him on the back.

His eye twitched as a look of insanity took over his face.I poured coffee into my cup as Timothy walked in behind me. I waited for the cup to be full to start pleasantries, that way I could be out the door by the time he said he was doing well.

"How you doing today, Tim?" I asked. 

"Uhn," he responded, shuffling past me.

"Oh, you've got to be kidding me. You too? What was seriously so wrong with your life that you went and switched to another one?" I asked scathingly. He glanced in my direction. Turned his head to the side in thought, then slowly opened his mouth. 

"Eh," he shrugged.

I couldn't believe it. Tim was the head of HR, so now we'd have to get that settled before the company started to fall apart in his absence. I left the kitchen and went straight to my boss's office. His door was open so I let myself in. 

He was staring intently at the Newton's Cradle on his desk, his eyes bouncing along with the motion of each hit. I waited for him to acknowledge me. 

Nothing. 

I cleared my throat and looked at him expectantly. He nodded ever so slightly. I took it as a go-ahead. 

"Tim's restarted. We need to fire him and get new HR," I said conspiratorily, not wanting to let the others freak out over this. 

"Huh?" he mumbled, still following the ends of the cradle. He began nodding along with each of the clacks of the toy. A small smile formed. 

"I said Tim re--" it hit me, "*You* restarted!? Why would you-- How are you so shortsighted-- Am I the only one that sees this as a problem. Not only do you run from your problems, but you leave us with the garbage to clean up. You're pathetic, you know that?" I said, turning around. He grunted, sounding a little upset, but otherwise didn't react. 

My face flushed red as I found myself face to face with his secretary. My teeth clenched as I began rerunning what I just told him and tried to surmise how much of it she overheard by the expression in her face. She looked severely disappointed in me before looking over my shoulder and saying,

"Good morning! Looking good today, Mr. Roth," then she turned away without another glance at me. 

I was almost angry at her, then realized she probably didn't know the situation. 

"You know he restarted, right?" I said, condescendingly. 

She stopped in her tracks. She turned slowly to look at the boss. She stared with consternation, really trying to put together whether I was telling the truth or not. Then she looked at me and said loudly, 

"Good morning! Looking good today!" then she turned and resumed her way to her desk. Once at her computer she began clicking around her desktop background which was a picture of an office building that said *Company* on the front.

My jaw dropped. 

"Do... do I have to restart? Have all of you really quit? I'm not gonna stay here if you're all a bunch of drones!" I yelled. A couple people looked up over their computers, but none of them responded. I sat down in a chair and sighed loudly. I supposed there was no other thing to do than restart, myself.

The front door opened to a man holding a huge stack of donut boxes and pulling a shopping cart's worth of chocolate bars behind him. He dropped all the boxes and I saw it was Ning, with a wild smile on his face. 

"Dude, all the employees at Donut Stop *and* Candy Mayhem have restarted! I just nabbed all this stuff and walked out the door! Wanna go to the mart down the street and get some sodas with me to wash it down? The cashier's eyes there looked pretty glazed over too!" he was huffing with both exhaustion and excitement. He didn't even seem to notice any of the others in the office, he looked directly at me and shook with energy, waiting for my response. 

Restarting could wait until we ran out of things to do here, I suppose.I watched the group of kids sitting in the park from my car, each of them experiencing something different in their drug-induced stupor. One was crying his eyes out while clutching his chest. Another stared blankly in front of him. And the third looked furious, veins popping and body shaking in his rage. None of them uttered a word, but it didn't look like any of them were having a good time. 

I was a little curious, I'll admit. Why would the X only be allowed for children and minors? Especially when this was the result of their consumption. Why would it be made legal in the first place? These kids couldn't have been older than fifteen, but the drug had made them all look decades beyond their age in stress. Why would someone my age want to experience that?

Suddenly, the three of them looked at each other with energy, compassion, and elation in their eyes. They looked around themselves, and whopped with joy. The three of them clasped hands and started jumping in a circle. I could almost feel the youth exuding from them. The one that was previously crying tried to do a back-flip and landed on his back. While it looked painful, he laughed and the other two join with him, excitedly pulling him to his feet. They didn't look high, though. Only as though they had finished going on a roller coaster or saw an action movie they loved.

I sighed and got out of the car. I was finally going to confront someone who had done the drug and understand the firsthand account of it. 

The three were still shouting and dancing around each other when they saw me approach. They looked at me strangely, like they sympathized with my for not being able to take the drug. They watched silently, stopping their dance, as I continued to walk over. Their patience drew me to them. The one that was previously shaking with rage looked at me like I was dying. 

"Sorry," he said to me, looking at a last pill of X that was sitting in a capsule on the table beside them. He was breathing hard, working hard to contain his previous excitement.

"You don't have to be sorry, it's not like you did anything illegal," I responded with a smile. 

"I'm not apologizing," he said, politely, but didn't elaborate further. 

"What does the drug do?" I asked.

The one that was crying looked at the two others before answering. He still had wet streaks on his face,

"It... I don't know how to explain it. It makes me happy to be me," he said. 

"Yeah, that's what they said on the news. It's meant to make the youth happy as who they are, but why can't it do that for me?" I asked.

The three looked at each other, worried. 

"You don't want to take it, mister. You definitely won't be happy," he responded, refusing to look at me when he said so.

"Oh, come on, I'm sure I can handle the part before the happiness comes in," I said, going towards the table.

"No! You don't understand! It's not like that! Like it makes you happy if you're young... I don't know how to put it!" he pleaded as I grabbed the container, shaking the pill around in the capsule.

I looked at the three of them slyly, then popped the capsule open, dumping the pill in my hand. 

"Seriously, you don't want it," he said, but could tell I'd already made up my mind. 

I swallowed the pill and sat down as they had earlier. I was almost immediately hit was visions.

I saw images of me in my old age. Not much older than I was now. I was miserable, working the same job day in and day out, never having enough time to really enjoy my life. I went home, went to sleep, then did the same thing the next day. Even my weekends were wasted in front of a TV. I never got to experience all the things I wanted to do in life because I had to work.

Then, the visions flipped. I was young again! I could do whatever I wanted! I had little to no consequences of my actions! I could scream, stay up really late at night, or even stay up through an entire night. I could eat whatever I wanted and suffer little in terms of weight. School was nothing in comparison to what the first visions revealed.

The last feeling I got was that I was *still* young! I can appreciate my youth while I still have it! I was free! All these thoughts went through my mind before the pill wore off, leaving me slapped in the face with reality. I didn't have any feeling of elation, only that of disappointment and misery. 

I *wasn't* young and restless, in fact my legs hurt from sitting down in this position too long. The drug had the power to make someone appreciate their youth while they still had it, but I was much too far gone. I was living the miserable memories from the beginning. 

I looked to the three kids who had started playing tag while I sat through my experience. They were overjoyed with the use of their legs and ability to tackle one another. But I was stuck where I was. I could never go back and I couldn't have what they did. 

I sighed, got up, and went back to my life.He stared blankly at me. His eyes were glazed over as he slowly regained focus on his surroundings. His pupils dilated and the skin of his eyes went tight.

"Wh... where am I?" he asked hesitantly.

"You're in the police station. Do you remember how you got here?" I asked.

"I..." he scrunched his face inscrutable as he attempted to recall what had brought him here. He shook his head, at first slowly, then with more certainty. I nodded encouragingly.

"What's the last thing you remember?"

"I was going to die and then.." he grabbed at his chest suddenly and breathed deeply, "Am I dead? Did I die?" he gasped.

"Well.." this was new. I have never seen one who remembered their death without being explicitly told of it. It usually took a while to get them to get to grips with their confession being the last thing they could do on this plane of existence. 

"Yes. You're dead," I decided to answer.

"And you're a resurrection person? A resurrecter?" he asked conspiratorially.

"Uhh... No. I'm just a detective. People come back to life as a result of me investigating their deaths."

"Wow, this must be really great for autopsy. You don't need to know how someone died if they can just tell you, huh detective?" he asked excitedly. He was eerily chipper.

"Well, not quite. I can only resurrect those that have been murdered. Homicide and such. Death by illness, suicide, or natural causes won't return to this life."

"What? Then how did you bring me ba--"

"Look, I'm just a detective trying to figure out who killed you. I need to know the last thing you remember before waking up in this room. You were found on 7th Street. What happened while you were there?" I asked, pulling out my pen and notepad.

"Oh, of course! Yeah, umm... was going to get some fresh air for the last time in my life and then I walked into the street and woke up here."

"Yes, we found you on the street. Are you aware that 7th Street is notorious for crimes of a violent nature? One of the last places in the city that people are still killed. You were shot four times in the chest. Probably just for trespassing."

"I... I was shot??" he asked shocked. He went pale, like the realization of being shot was much more daunting than the prospect of being dead.

"That's right," I said, taking note of his odd reactions. He was hiding something.

"You're telling me I was found in the middle of the street, shot to death??" he yelled.

"I never said you were in the middle of the street..."

"Yeah, but that's where I was, wasn't it detective?" he implored.

"That's correct," I nodded, taking note of the fact he knew where he died. "Do you remember who did it? Perhaps a rival gang?" I asked, hoping he wouldn't refute the claim that he was in a gang. It would sure make things easier that another random homicide in the area.

"No, I... well, I remember a black car coming down the street and someone yelling at me and that's it. You're sure I was shot to death?" he asked again.

"What kind of car was it?" I asked quickly.

"I don't know! It was supposed to hit me, I didn't think I'd get shot!" he said, upset. I put my pen down.

"What?"

"I stepped into the street for the car to hit me. It skidded to a halt. Man, the driver must have been so mad he just shot me. I can't believe this," he shook his head, disappointed.

"What do you mean the car was supposed to hit you?"

"What do you think it means? I walked into the street to get hit by the car. End my life. I must have stepped in too early..." he said, pursing his lips in thought.

"You killed yourself??" I said, nonplussed.

"Well, I tried to," he laughed good-naturedly. "Looks like someone else got me. Just when I thought I would finally have control over *something* in my life, someone else goes and takes it away. Life's a mystery, huh detective?"

As the mystery had been solved, his essence slowly faded from the room, leaving me with my mouth gaping at the dead man becoming transparent before me. He gave me one last shrug as left this world for the second and last time.I looked around the field stretching before me. My jaw was slack, trying to understand what I was seeing. The air had tested positive for breathability, but I still didn't feel safe enough to pull off my helmet. I had traveled for over three years to reach this planet. I wasn't about to let it catch me off guard.

Suddenly, my muscles went rigid when I heard the sound of something approaching from just behind a hill before me. I went numb, afraid of whatever could lurk on this planet after existing in tandem to Earth for eons. What kind of creatures would be made in what was essentially the same ecosystem, under a different set of locations in the galaxy? My jaw somehow dropped further when its head and shoulders peeked above the hill.

"Hey, what're you doin' out here?" he asked. It was a man. A human man. A tanned farmer wearing overalls, a farmer's hat, and a twig between his teeth to put it all together. I stared dumbfounded at the sight.

"You some kinda crazy?" he asked, taking a tentative step toward me. He was gripping tightly to a shotgun. 

"Ah, no, I'm... I'm an astronaut!" I said, after gathering courage. I pointed to the ship behind me with outstretched arms. 

"Uh-huh," he said, his grip tightening over the shotgun as a stretched slowly across his face, "and how did you manage to bring this ship into this here farm, Mister Astronaut?"

"I landed here?" I said, wondering how he could have missed the cacophonous landing.

"So that was you makin' all that racket?" he asked, eyeing me with more disgust as he sized up my suit, "Where you headed with that thing?"

"Headed? I *just* landed here!" I said, pointing out the burned grass around the ship's engine.

"I meant where you headed once'n you get out to space?" he gestured with his gun to the sky and took another deliberate step forward. He took a chomp and spit the twig out of his mouth.

"That's what I'm saying, I came here from space! I just landed right here on this spot!" I said, my hands going up as he took another step forward with his firearm.

"Oh yeah? An' what planet you come from, then? Describe her for me," he ordered.

"I-- I uh--" I remembered the lecture I was going to give to aliens if I ever encountered any, "I come from a planet made mostly of water, with a vast blue sky lit by a star brighter than anything in my ship. A land filled with all kinds of creatures whether living in grasslands, water, or just plain desert land. It uhh--" I stopped when he stopped about three feet away from me, gun trained on my chest.

"Sounds an awful lot like this here planet, don't it?" he asked.

I swallowed hard, and my mouth went dry. I didn't move, except to extend my arms a little higher above me.

"I know what this is," he hissed, "You think you people can just come into my country, spy on us from the inside and take over, well I got somethin' for you to take back to your leaders back in whatever country you're from. I ain't getting tricked by your fancy space machinery, you hear? We got our own space tech in this here beautiful country ready to fly out and discover an inhabitable world for humans. A real astronaut. Not some fella in a costume, too scared to even look at me face to face without a visor sittin' between us. And once we find it, we'll make a Terra 2 an' send my grandkids there, ya hear?" 

I stood motionless, slowly processing what he was saying.

"You have a space program of your own here on Terra?" I mumbled.

He cocked his shotgun and I scrambled back into the ship. 

"Stay outta my land," he said, firing a shot into the air as I got the ship up and ready to roll. I filled out my report with all the adrenaline I still had, barely able to remember the incidents as well as write them. I ended it with one note:

    Uninhabitable. Already occupied by hostile creatures."I just feel like the first thing they would do is eat me," Vernella said, hesitantly. 

"*Eat you!?* Oh, come on! This is my family we're talking about! You think I would love something that would eat you!? They're excited to meet you!" I yelled encouragingly. Granit came and nudged at my legs,

"Are you sure they'll like me?" he asked quietly. I attempted to pick him up but realized he became much too large for that years ago. I placed a hand on his head. He flushed from embarrassment. His head was powerfully warm.

"They won't just like you, Granit. They'll *love* you, just like they love me. Do you know how long I lived with them?" I asked. He shook his head with large, curious eyes. 

"Longer than you've been alive!" I said, poking him on the nose. He giggled and scampered back between his mother's legs. 

Vernella took powerful steps towards me. If I didn't know her, I might have even thought she was going to hurt me. She leveled with me and looked me with deeply intelligent eyes.

"You're certain that we won't be hurt at this reunion. Even though your family is..." she let the silence complete her sentence. 

"Of course," I said, excitedly, seeing her come around to the idea. She closed her eyes and lowered her head in thought. She breathed out through her nose as she came to a conclusion. It was really hot when she did that. 

"You grew into such a wonderful man with them. I'd hate to be rude and not show up. Especially if they mean so much to you," she lamented. Granit nodded in agreement, though he still remained between his mother's legs. 

"Awesome!" I yelled, jumping for joy. "I promise you won't regret this, you're gonna have a great time!"

"How do we get there?" she asked. 

"It's right over the Travik Mountains," I said, pointing outside the cave.

"Excellent," she said, spreading her wings to their full, magnificent length, "do you want a ride?"

I jumped on her neck, anxious. I really hoped my mom and little brother would like my wife.I closed the oven and promised myself to get the food out later. This was a particularly distracting dilemma and I didn't want to burn myself.

&#x200B;

"Are you still there?" they asked. Typical of them to be insecure when I'm quiet for like 5 seconds.

&#x200B;

"Yep, yep, I'm just processing this whole... why can't you crash with anyone else?" I started pacing, walking to each room of the apartment.

&#x200B;

"Oh, come on, we know I wouldn't be able to stand being with mom for more than a day, and I don't know how long I'll be here."

&#x200B;

"Because you did something really bad in the other dimension?" I asked.

&#x200B;

"Yeah, but not on purpose! Come on, you know me better than anyone, would we do something malicious!?"

&#x200B;

I thought about that for a second. I noticed they didn't say anything more. Did they hang up because I didn't respond fast enough?

&#x200B;

"Are you still there?" I asked.

&#x200B;

"Yep, so can I stay over?" they pleaded.

&#x200B;

"I dunno. I don't want you leaving your clothes everywhere. And not doing the dishes. And never cleaning the bathroom. You'd leave this place a mess," I shrugged.

&#x200B;

"You already do that!!" they yelled.

&#x200B;

"Yeah, but you'd do it like, doubly so. So, you know..." I shrugged again.

&#x200B;

"Come on! What will it take? I can bring you some peanut butter candy! A whole bag full! All king size!"

&#x200B;

Tempting. I had to weigh my options. I looked at the pile of shirts in the corner of my room.

&#x200B;

"Are you still there?" they asked.

&#x200B;

"Yep, I just need to think some more.." I hesitated.

&#x200B;

"I really don't have time to let you think more! I need to get inside somewhere immediately!" they yelled. For a moment, I thought I could smell them fuming. Scary how connected we were.

&#x200B;

"Ok, ok, but I get to take morning showers," I offered.

&#x200B;

"What!? But then I'll be all gross and oily in the morning," they yelled. I almost swore I could feel the heat from them, too.

&#x200B;

"And... And you have to tell me what you did that was so serious that you had to come here," I said with confidence. 

&#x200B;

Nothing from the other end. I probably went too far. I shouldn't have pushed myself so hard, now they would hate me and I'd always regret this night. I bet they already hung up.

&#x200B;

"Are you still there?" I asked, feeling even warmer in embarrassment. 

&#x200B;

"Yep.... I'll tell you, but promise not to laugh," they replied quietly.

&#x200B;

"Ok, I'll try not to," I said, not wanting to make a promise I can't keep.

&#x200B;

"So... In my dimension, I lived in an apartment where I was working on the technology to jump between dimensions. I was so invested in it, tuning out pretty much everything else in the world while I was working on it." I nodded, knowing the feeling. "So, the night I finished it, I accidentally started a fire. The fire spread insanely fast throughout the apartment, and spread to the upper floors. On one of the floors was a young girl, like three years old, and she died of smoke inhalation. So, her dad is super rich and hates me and wants to kill me now. I ran through the machine, but he came right after me."

&#x200B;

I was sweating now, I couldn't tell why, though. Maybe it was vicarious anxiety. 

&#x200B;

"How come you could use the machine if it was on fire?" I asked.

&#x200B;

"No, the machine didn't go on fire. I left some food in the oven and it went up in flames. I never got around to replacing the smoke detector batteries so I didn't even realize until--"

&#x200B;

I had dropped my phone from my hand as I finally absorbed the scene around me. Flames licked the entire outskirts of my kitchen and were crawling up the walls to upper floors and slowly approaching me. I started coughing from the smoke and screamed in fear. I picked up my phone and ran outside.

&#x200B;

"ARE YOU STILL THERE!?" they were yelling.

&#x200B;

"Yep! Yep! I just started a fire in the apartment, though!" 

&#x200B;

There was silence. The kind that envelops you because you're too stunned to come up with words to contribute. The kind where your silence speaks so many times louder than your words because you typically can't deal with silence, but it was being freely offered by you. To yourself.

&#x200B;

"Are you still there?" I asked weakly, taking more steps back onto the street to watch as the flames continued jumping up the stories. 

&#x200B;

"Is it at the fourth floor yet?" they asked seriously. 

&#x200B;

"I think it passed the sixth," I said.

&#x200B;

"Great. Now we're gonna need another machine," they groaned."Stop right there!" I heard a man call pulling his gun from his holster.

I smirked, and broke the speed of light, phasing through him. He collapsed backwards and grasped at his chest. 

"You can't do that! It's against the laws!" 

I walked through the wall behind him, occupying its space at the same time it did. He continued to yell after me from behind the wall and screamed something about backup. I waltzed out of the bunker, carrying the loot over my shoulder. It was a good haul. Not that I needed the haul. I just wanted the government to hurt. 

I walked down the driveway when I was confronted by an entire troop of security before me. There must have been a dozen guns trained on me and a tank behind them.

"If you don't stand down, I'll lower all of your melting points to the outside temperature," I threatened.

Three guns when down immediately. I heard a loudspeaker come from the tank:

"Even *you* can't do that," it teased. "It's against the law!" 

I frowned, raising my hand. 

"My gun isn't firing! It's jammed!!" one yelled.

"My trigger won't move!" another screamed, panicking. The three that had dropped their guns earlier took the time of confusion to run off. They respected my power. They would live to tell the tale.

"Your triggers no longer follow the third law of motion. You action registers a ten times reaction. You can't push the trigger."

"That doesn't make, ahhhh----" his arm had melted off mid-sentence as I kept my promise from earlier. I walked forward smugly, as each of the remaining men and tank converged into one, large mix of their respective puddles. Pretty gross, I'd never broken this law before.

I made my way to the entrance, ready to follow my way to the getaway vehicle.

"They'll be after you, you know," a man hiding behind the gate said nonchalantly. "They'll catch you soon enough. You can't hide forever. You even won't be able to sell that gold. No one will take it. Not even the black market, once they see how dangerous it is to associate with you."

I turned my bag of gold into a bag of lead and left it at the front gate. 

"I wouldn't dream of selling stolen goods," I replied coolly. "That's *illegal.*"I looked at the ring of guards, unphased by their spears pointed at me. I was sure my kevlar could handle them at this distance. I was sure he would ask the make of my clothes, because of their modernity, but instead, the king stifled a yawn as he looked over me. I felt self-conscious. 

"Your Majesty," I began, "I came--"

"From a land in the future? With technologies unknown? Knowledge beyond our comprehension? Torches that require no flames? Arrows that are cased in metal and fire multiple times from some chamber? Bah!" he spat, picking up a loaf of bread from next to his throne and tearing off a chunk. Something crinkled as he returned the bread to its place behind the throne.

"Ah... Well..." I was frozen, not only intimidated by his lack of fascination but seemingly pulled all the words straight from my mouth. I had brought a flashlight, a gun, and two walkie talkies. Things that I thought would be within his understanding while equally beyond what he thought possible.

"What year, eh?" he asked, signaling with a finger for me to come forward. His guards took a step back, allowing me to approach him.

"What?"

"Year? What year did you come from? Or do you call it different in your future? What's the era you come from?" he said impatiently, taking another massive bite from his bread. It was only then that I noticed that he was pulling the pieces of bread out of a plastic bag.

"I--" I couldn't stop my stammering, "I'm from-from the year 2019."

"Ah. Any smartphones, eh?" he asked, curiously.

I shook my head.

"Portable charger? Or maybe batteries? Double-A is what I need," he said, pulling a GameBoy out of his robe and swinging it a couple of times for me to see before returning it to his chest pocket.

"I'm sorry..." I began slowly, trying to wrap my mind around his words, "were you expecting things of that sort? I didn't consider that you might--"

"Did you think us too daft to understand your technologies and bring rudimentary items, then? Flashlights are a fan-favorite from your era. Personally, I'm a fan of sliced bread, but no one thinks to bring that one over. You're all the same. Let's see it then, what do you have?" he waved a hand. The soldiers approached again, but I saw it was out of curiosity and not hostility.

"Well this is--"

"Oh *wow,*" the king sang mockingly, "are those communication devices?? What a *fascinating* piece of technology. And, *by God* it's a gun. Aren't those dated even in your times? Even our kingdom begins using them in about 300 years," he groaned.

"You don't have to be so mean," I grumbled.

"Oh, right, we're supposed to worship you for your powers and gifts! You didn't even give us any good ones! Did you fail to notice that all of the royal guards have a flashlight of their own?"

I looked and saw that each of them did have a multitude of flashlights on their belts, all of different makes and brands. 

"Additionally," he said, laying back in his throne, bored, "nothing has pleased this court more than the hoverboards."

"H-Hoverboards?" I asked.

"Oh no," he said like he was ridiculing a child, "are the 2019 kids still dealing with regular skateboards and bikes? That's quite sad, you might perish before you get to see them in your lifetime."

"May I see one?" I asked, excitedly.

"No, you've already wasted too much of my valuable time. If you remain then another time traveler cannot come with better gifts, lest he messes with the fabric of time itself."

"How do you know about the--"

"No more questions! Leave the flashlight and go! Pray it doesn't have Triple-A batteries or else it won't even be used in our halls. They never last," he grumbled, pulling more bread out of his bag. Before I could ask anything more, the spears pointed at me once again, and the guards forced me to travel back forward in time. As the light of time shimmered around me, I heard the king say,

"And don't come back if you aren't bringing anything cool!""Everyone stays down and no one gets hurt! You! Cop! I'm gonna take your gun alright? No quick moves!" the robber said, training his gun on the man dressed as a cop. His ski mask was on tight and betrayed the fear in his eyes.

"Amateur," the false cop muttered under his breath, cringing at the fact the robber had come alone for this robbery. If anyone else was a cop of sorts in this place, he would be blindsided the moment he was focused on this fake cop. The robber inched forward, swallowing hard. 

"First time, huh?" the disguised man asked. 

"What?" the robber yelped, surprised by the question. 

Suddenly, a ringing jolted the two of them and they shipped their heads around, realizing all the phones in the bank were going off at once. The robber fumbled at his phone to pull it out and silence it.

"What's going on!?" he asked, before looking at the screen. His eyebrows furrowed downward and his mouth opened and closed a few times before he could read what was on screen.

"It says... it says 'Hands up everyone, this is a robbery,'" he said, showing the fake cop his phone screen. The cop pulled out his own phone, to which the robber was too curious to see rather than tell him to not make any sudden movements.

"It's an amber alert!" the man in blue said, astonished. Perhaps this robber was a professional. 

The cashier peeked out over the counter, wondering why the silent alarm hadn't brought any cops, as his plan to clear the bank vault relied upon the cops swarming the place. The bulletproof glass sat between him and the rest of the hostages.

"Are you a professional?" he asked, over the register.

"Me or him?" the man dressed as a cop asked, stowing his phone and handing his plastic gun to the robber. 

"I wouldn't call myself a professional, yet," the robber blushed behind his mask. "I hope that after this--"

He yelped as the lights went out and he heard a number of people began scuffling around the room.

"I said nobody move!" he said pathetically. When the lights had come back on, he saw that he was standing without the cop. The rest of the room looked like a display of mannequins, as the rest of the would-be robbers froze in place, afraid to have the newbie accidentally shoot them while they began their heists.

"What's.." he was cut off yet again by a screech shattering the bulletproof glass between him and the cashier. His eyes went wide as the hostages looked between him and the open counter. The man who sat behind the register ran for the vault. As soon as he left the room, the sprinkler system went off and the rest of the room broke into pandemonium. Some charged at the registers to pull out what little money could be found in there while a number of others walked briskly back to the vault with various tools being pulled from their jackets and pants. 

The robber swung his gun from left to right, trying to get a semblance of the power he felt at the beginning of his excursion. He gritted his teeth and ran for the front doors, cutting his losses before the mob inevitably got caught in a shoot-out with the coming police force. He made it to the front door when he saw that he was too late. Two men in swat clothing stood at the glass, looking inside. 

As soon as they made eye contact, the door flew open and they grabbed him by his arms. He made no moves to try and break free, as he was too afraid of what they'd do to him.

"Don't worry. We're with *him,*" one of them whispered knowingly. 

"Wha?" he began to ask as he was whisked into the flower truck next to the bank. He heard an ear-shattering explosion as the back of the bank blew out and a helicopter came in from overhead. He heard a car screech out on the street fleeing the scene. 

In a daze, he decided that the market was far too saturated to be robbing banks. Perhaps he'd find another criminal profession with less demand.The beast coughed more blood before me. I stepped away, my back now covered by the chemistry set under the bed.

"How much longer can you keep this up Fluffles? Just look at how the young lord treats you. Seems your eye is chipped. And is that stuffing I see under your arms?" it said coyly, struggling to remain in this world.

"Silence, creature! How much longer I last is none of my concern, so long as every moment is spent in this underworld is spent on the protection of the young ruler!" I cried, smiling at him. 

"You say that, but can you even stand tonight's onslaught!?" it screamed, as a shadow darted past it and punctured me in my leg. I cried out in pain and punched at it with my fluffy paws, dealing great damage to whatever had made the wound. After dealing a sufficient amount of damage the dark weapon stuck inside me, it darted away from me. A creature with eight legs appeared before me, looming over both me and my previously defeated creature. 

"This is the Fluffles I've heard so much about? Impressive that you were able to withstand Mawlik's attacks," it said haughtily. I braced myself for another leg to come at me. 

"I'm not defeated yet, Queen Arknia! And I did Fluffles a good deal of damage! I'm sure if we--" the voice cut out as Mawlik's lungs were punctured by one of the Queen's sharp legs. He tried to cry out, but could only effectively roll his eyes back and collapse dead. 

She looked at me, disinterested and then ran perpendicular to me, straight to the young lord's leg dangling over the bed. 

"Stop!" I boomed, jumping at her with my paws at the ready. She turned to me with a wicked gleam in her eyes and stabbed me through the chest with two legs. I had fallen for her bait. I grabbed on to her legs with a powerful grip and attempted to throw her behind me. She was far too heavy. 

"Oh, dear. Have you finally met your match to me, Fluffles? Unable to toss me like the ragdoll I will soon make of you?" she asked, moving her legs away from each other and creating a small hole in my chest. I gagged on stuffing coming up my throat but kept my grip firm. She used another leg to pin down my ear and then began tearing that off as well. 

I screamed in pure agony but only made my soft arms grip tighter over her, refusing to allow her to gain any momentum towards the young lord. If only I had light. All monsters would die at the sight of it, but the young master had decided that he was too old for night lights long ago. 

"There goes one ear!" she squealed with delight. "And while you still have me here, why don't I go ahead and take the other?" she stabbed into the other ear as she tossed the first one into my face. I began crawling back from her with all I strength I had. I had to get away.

"Fluffles, we both know this is where you die," she said, both opening the wound in my chest further and pulling out my other ear. "Why struggle?" 

I hit a wall behind me and smiled. She looked at me quizzically as I flipped the entire box over myself, drenching the two of us in various liquids from the chemistry set.

"What are you--" 

I used the two legs in my chest as a spark to put us both ablaze. She shrieked in horror and attempted to run away but was pulverized by the single flame that licked her being. I rolled around until I was only smoldering and no longer in complete flame. I breathed slowly, feeling at the wounds at both my stomach and my head. 

I was going to die. 

I would die satisfied, knowing that I truly did make a difference for the young master. My bad eye fell out and my other one closed slowly, as I accepted my fate as a martyr.

"Mommy!" I heard a voice from a distance. "I think I broke Fluffles in my sleep last night!" the young master was crying, holding my almost lifeless shell of a body in his arms tenderly. "Can you fix it?"

A few moments passed.

"With a few stitches and a good wash in the sink, Fluffles will be good as new!"

I smiled before falling completely unconscious. I had more time to protect the young lord.The wind whipped around me as I got a hold to pull something from the monster realm. I was the first in my class, of course. Everyone else was still struggling to even open the Gate. I pulled harder as I felt the force pulling back against me. Back and forth we fought, until a crowd of students gathered around me to watch me fight. I could feel their admiration and envy. It fueled me to finally put a tight grip and pull the monster through.

"**You're mine!**" I exploded nonchalantly, heaving the beast through the gate. The gate closed with a *pop* as a tadpole fell before me, probably extra fluff that came through with my own intended monster. It flopped on the floor aimlessly as we all searched around the room for my monster. 

"Is it invisible?" Fardimer asked from my right, bearing a defensive position. A couple other students were passed his paranoia and followed suit.

"No need to worry," the teacher calmed the class, "Richter has full control of the monster. It won't attack without his say-so now that it's been pulled through by him." His snake monster nodded in agreement.

We spent a few more seconds searching the room for my invisible creature, until I began suspecting that I didn't pull anything through at all. But I was certain something was fighting me. Could I have failed.

"Hey, master, a little help," we heard from where I opened the gate. We all spun to see it, but there was nothing there.

"Ah, so you are invisible," I sighed with relief.

"No, but I am small," the tadpole said from below me, flopping slightly. I smiled at the joke. Then frowned when I felt his life force connected to my own.

"Surely you can't be..." I whispered.

"Richter summoned a baby fish!" Fardimer screamed, bursting out in laughter.

"Did you focus your energy on a pond??" a girl called from my right.

"No," I answered plainly, trying to convince myself this wasn't real.

"Are you gonna pick me up, or not master?" the tadpole asked.

I knelt and put him in my hand. He was the size of my thumb. Maybe smaller.

"What are your--" I swallowed, already fearing the answer, "strengths?"

"Well, I tell it like it is. And I am not strong," it responded, flopping happily in my hand. That might be its way of laughing. 

"Why was it that I summoned you?" I asked it, still wrapping my mind around the fact that my incantation really brought this out after all my work. Years of effort and training for this.

"Beats me," it flopped. Was that a shrug?

"What a catch, Chibelle!!" the teacher sprang to his feet, his monster slithering up to his neck to get a better view. Chibelle had summoned a two story gollem, which knelt in loyalty as she squealed in delight in front of it.

"Whoa," I said, my envy burning within me.

"Don't be jealous, master. Gollems can't do too much aerobic work for more than 50 minutes. They're strong, for sure, but get them past their time limit and they won't be able to even hurt me. Plus, they're all weak to Cherry-wood. Kills them instantly," my tadpole confided quietly in me.

My head shot towards my tadpole. 

"How do you know this? This isn't in any of our texts," I whispered skeptically.

"I know plenty, master," it wiggled, proudly, "like that Chibelle is already deathly afraid of it, despite the facade she's putting on."

I watched her closely. She danced around excitedly, but didn't get anywhere closer than 5 feet to it. She ordered it to go run outside. I looked to my monster once again.

One by one, my peers brought out huge monsters at their side of various skill and grace. And one by one, my monster would explain why it was a weak monster in many circumstances. Additionally, it would tell me about the mannerisms of my classmates. Things I never took notice of. Their left foot was weak. They were insecure about their height. They only come to school because their parents forced them. I slowly felt my bond growing. Finally, after the last of the monsters was brought forth, my teacher stood before the class and said,

"Whatever you may think of your monster," he looked pointedly to me, "you must give it a name. Choose wisely. You only get one monster. One bond for life. Give it something respectable."

My little prepubescent frog looked to me expectantly, hoping for a good one.

"I shall call you, Worthy. For I am not worthy to be your master," I decided.

He flopped. Happily."Ah man. Jeez oh man, what a..." Terrence shoved his gun deeper into his pocket as he fumbled for an apt description. "What a travesty. He never even got over his terrible cough," he sighed loudly. 

The others around the room nodded in solemn agreement, not taking their eyes off the body sprawled out before them. They had gathered around him after hearing Gertrude's scream of horror. She kicked a vial of poison further under the rug as she approached the body, touching the neck.

"Definitely dead, yep" she nodded uncomfortably, shaking under the stares of her companions. She looked up to Terrence, Cristina, and Shereen surrounding her, ensuring they hadn't seen her hide the murder weapon under the fabric beneath her and Howard. It seemed they were all as keen to avoid eye contact with her as she was with them. 

"Not just dead," said Shereen, wiping motor oil onto her pants, "looks to me like he was killed. That's no natural way to go," she declared.

"Surely, this was an accident," Cristina said as shocked as she could sound in her fake Spanish accent. She walked around the group with a fake limp, having tied a wooden plank to her leg after using it to let Howard fall to his demise. She began to sweat, not wanting to remain in the vicinity of the group.

"An accident??" Terrence yelled flabberghasted, "You really want us to believe that you believe this to be an accident? The pool of blood? The discoloration of his face? The bruises on his..." he gazed at the body a bit closer. Did he kill Howard? It looked like he fell down a flight of stairs or something. The gunshot wound at his shoulder almost looked negligible compared to the state of his body.

"Interesting how you notice the aspects of his death faster than you seem to care for his death!" Shereen yelled, finally tearing her eyes away from Howard in order to point an accusatory finger. "I distinctly remember you having a tube of sorts when we entered the mansion. Was that a silencer, perhaps?" 

Terrence stiffened, had he been caught so quickly?

"And what about you? The air reeks of oil in here, were you cleaning your car in the middle of the night?" he retorted, quickly.

"Maybe I was," Shereen said, hands on her hips.

"*You were cleaning your car past midnight?* Why? What for?"

"What about Gertrude!? She screamed as soon as he hit the floor! What was she doing meandering around the middle of the night?" Cristiana said, glad to be out of the people being accused.

The other heads turned to her as the blood rushed away from her face quickly. 

"I, uhhhh, I was getting water from the kitchen," she said quickly. 

"Impossible, the kitchen is in the other direction, why would you be in this room?" Terrence asked, stunned.

"Why did she know I was in the room as soon as he hit the floor unless she was here herself!?" Gertrude screamed, staring daggers into Cristina.

"Me? Oh, no, I was...." the three stared at her intensely. 

"I was going..." she began breathing quickly.

"Fine! It was me, all right? I knew that he had that sickly cough and would likely get out of bed for water, so I set a plank at the edge of the stairs for him to slip on and tumble down the stairs. It would get him to misjudge his step in the darkness, understand? At first, I thought he caught himself, but he must have tripped again because he ended up crashing down the stairs anyway!" she said, collapsing on her knees, defeated. 

"Hang on, that's not right, I shot him," Terrence said quietly. Cristina was nonplussed.

"What?"

"I got my gun," he said, pulling out the silenced weapon, "I knew he would get water in the middle of the night for his cough, so I waited at the end of the room and shot him as soon as his silhouette came into view. His hands went to his throat right before I pulled the trigger so I missed his heart, but I definitely shot and killed him," he said, kicking Howard in the bullet wound.

"Well that can't be right, the wound doesn't look like it hit anything vital. I, on the other hand, put oil on the stairs. I knew he would want a glass of water for his dreadful cough, so as soon as all of you were in your rooms, I slathered the stairs with motor oil so he'd fall down and break his neck. Which he clearly did," she said with pride.

"No, no," Gertrude said, poking at his neck, "his neck and ribs are fine. Nothing broke from the fall down. I got him with poison, though!" she yelled with triumph as she pulled the vial out from under the rug. "You see, I was going to poison the water since I knew he would get water in the middle of the night for his cough, but he came and collapsed at my feet as soon as I was headed over. He was pointing to his neck -- still very much alive -- so I poured the poison down his throat and finished the job! He stopped breathing faster than the poison normally acts, but the job got done, so I did it!"

The three other would-be assassins looked distraught at being outdone in their craft. Howard seemed to be done entirely by one person alone.

"Ah, smart, you put the poison in a perfume bottle, too," Terrence pointed out.

"A perfu--" Gertrude looked at the vial. It was the same fragrance she spritzed around her room that night. There was no poison in the container.

"That can't be right, this wouldn't kill him at all," she said, confused. She rolled Howard over to see if there was still any contents of the liquid in his mouth to check if it really was poisonous. The others gathered around the body as Gertrude began pounding on his back. Something that was lodged in Howard's throat shot out onto the floor. It rolled for a moment, then stopped.

"It seems like..." Cristina began.

"This can't be real," Shereen said in utter disappointment.

"He choked to death on a cough drop!""I... I can't do anything about it," Al said, his hair running wild. His eyes blinked rapidly as his mind raced for the umpteenth time trying to find out what he could do. His eyes suddenly shot up to the man next to him. His eyes bore into him. "Jimmy, when did you die? How long do you think you'll last?"

"I died about a decade ago. I had a brother, but we weren't very close. Likely I'll go out around the time he does. Which, honestly, could be any day now. He wasn't in good health when I passed, but maybe he got over it if he got on this long. How long have you been here?" Jimmy said conversationally, looking up at the void. 

"Centuries... Millennia? I... There's no way to keep track," he shook his head aggressively, simultaneously receiving an epiphany and thinking it was a stupid idea.

Jimmy nodded. He didn't know who this guy was, but clearly a lot of people did. 

"So, you're still a big deal, then?" he said, still looking up at the void above, pleasantly.

"Not in the slightest. People don't remember who I was, but they keep mentioning my name, with me in mind. It's the only thing tying me to this wretched place, their incessant name calling!!" he screamed at Jimmy, but Jimmy didn't mind. It was the first guy he met with gray hair in this world, he probably had a right to be upset. 

"How can you not be a big deal, but people remember you?"

"I told you! The name! It's my cursed name! I tried to change it in this world so that I wouldn't be remembered, but it doesn't work like that." He stepped close to Jimmy, eyes twitching and fingers shaking wildly. "Did you know I used to be fascinated with this plane of existence? Just look around us! It disproves everything I thought about the universe. But I found out long ago that we're not on any plane of existence, so I suppose that point is moot." He shook his head, impatient with his inability to stay on one topic for very long.

"Look, Al, I really think you got something mixed up. You stay as long as people remember you. And therefore they do. Who were you when you were alive?"

"Have you heard of Louis Armstrong?"

"Uhhh.. can't say that I have? He a friend of yours?"

"No, he was a musician during my time, what about Nikola Tesla? Thomas Edison?"

"Never, who were they?"

"Forgotten inventors! Both ahead of their time! But they're still both long gone! I lost Tesla ages ago! Not that he and--"

Jimmy breathed deeply, and began to glow. He slowly started flaking apart. 

"Ah, looks like my brother's out, Al," he said, smiling. 

"Indeed so," he said bitterly. As agitated as he was, he enjoyed having someone to talk to. Someone who would listen instead of call him a crazy old man or by his name. How he hated his name.

"Chin up, Al. I'm sure you'll be forgotten, soon. But, in the meantime, it seems like you have a lot to work with. You're a real smart guy! In my time we called them 'Einsteins.'"

"I know.""I think it's over that ravine. Beyond the oxes and gooses," I whispered. 

"Oxen," he replied.

"What?"

"And *geese*," he said patiently. 

"Same difference," I shrugged. 

"No. Big difference. One is objectively right and the other wrong," he said matter of factly. 

"Okay, whatever, I didn't put this corpse together to be judged. We're a search party, not linguistic experts," I grumbled, mapping a route to the ravine. 

"Did you mean corps?"

"No, like a division in an army," I corrected. 

"Yeah, you mean a corps," he said. 

"No, the word ends in an s," I argued. 

"Yeah, that's corps," he said.

"Look, man, I'm a reader, not a speaker. I don't need you following me around and bringing me down like some sort of plag," I said, raising my voice.

He thought for a moment, and I took a moment to appreciate the silent he granted me.

"Did you mean plague?" he asked.

"Oh my God."

"I don't know how you could come up with plag," he said, confused.

"It looks *exactly* like the word plaque! It *literally* just replaces one letter and suddenly the whole pronunciation is thrown out!?"

"Yeah, I guess," he shrugged.

"The sooner we find the Holy Grammar Symbol, the better. I hope it allows us to alter the language itself. I can't wait to look back on the ridiculousness of the language once we've edited it," I said, standing and signaling for the rest of the group to move in.

"Ed ed ed ed?" he asked.

"What? No, edited it. The past tense of edit it," I said. 

"What's ed ed ed?" he said slowly.

"No, like, when I finish with it I will have edited it."

"You're messing with me now. You're just repeating consonant sounds," he said, frustrated. 

"Edited it," I enunciated.

"Stop! I never intended to mock you, I'm sorry!" he said curtly.

"No, edited it!" I yelled.

"Yes! Fine! Whatever! We'll go ed ed ed the Holy Grammar Symbol!" he exclaimed and began walking. 

I shook my head. It would be easier to alter the entire language than to explain it to him.A platoon stood before me, all completely red in the face except for one. He looked fresh, well-rested, and ready for battle. I walked up to him, getting right into his face. He went pale, further enraging me. 

"Private Wats?" I asked loudly.

"Sir!" he responded. I took a couple of slow steps around him. 

"How did you sleep, son? You sleep well?" I asked seemingly innocently. He swallowed hard.

"I slept well, sir!" he yelled. 

"Did you sleep comfortably? Have a nice mattress?"

"Correct, sir!" he yelled, his eyes becoming smaller.

"Ah, fantastic! A well-rested army is one that's healthy and ready for battle, right? One that's unstoppable, as we've seen time and time again, am I right?"

He stood sweating, his face burning with embarrassment. I pulled the man next to him up next to me, placing my arm around his shoulders. 

"How would you like that I shoot you, Private Kimbly?" I asked him, looking at Watts all the while.

"I wouldn't mind, sir!" Kimbly declared with true confidence. 

"That's bold of you, son. What about you, Watts? How does a bullet sound right about now?" I asked Watts. Watts continued to look past me.

"I asked you a question, Watts!" I cried, allowing Kimbly to take his place. 

"No, sir! I don't think I would do well to taking a bullet!" he said.

"And why is that?" I asked, in mocking surprise. I looked out at the horizon and saw a missile coming toward us. 

"Don't answer that, Watts, we have another missile coming our way. Prepare for the ambush ladies," I said, putting my hand up and taking a few steps back. No one made a move except for Watts who turned to the missile and screamed as it covered the sun. He shielded his face and cried out as the explosion consumed us all. Once the sensation of heat left us, I looked to see the platoon -- sans Watts -- hadn't moved an inch. The only change was that all of our clothing had been torn clean off and there was a black smolder where Watts previously stood. 

I took a glance at the building behind me and saw that the walls of a barracks had been blown off. Inside was a number of men taking a nap upside down, all hanging from the ceiling like bats. None of them looked comfortable. Most were completely red and sometimes purple in the face. But all struggled to keep their eyes closed. I nodded in approval seeing that Watts seemed to be a fluke and the rest of the army was sleeping as the future man told me to. The Upside Down Invincibility he called it.

"All right, Building Charlie still looks to be intact. Looks like they've got mortars and I think I see a tank on the horizon. Go grab some tools to take them down. If there aren't enough tools for you, just use random debris from the missile. I want you all back here for training in 3 hours."

"Sir!"He sat crying at the room in the inn. He was eating a very simple meal, one that he struggled to by nature of his fits of grief. 

His latest quest had required him to kill an oppressive emperor. As he was leaving, he was stopped by a young girl who asked where her daddy had gone. He tried to console her, relating to the loss of his own parents at her age, but he couldn't hold himself together. They began crying together. My heart swelled in compassion for him. I knew what he needed, and I knew how to find it. 

He drank his water in large gulps, replenishing what his tears had been continuously drying out. I watched from a tree through the window as he looked wistfully at the young girl sleeping on the bed with a frown, remembering his parents once again. He had promised to take care of her but looked fearful for the coming days. He had no experience with children. And no experience being a child.

There was a faint knock at the door, and my heart leaped. His gift was here! He got up groggily and went to the door. 

"I asked not to be bothered. Who's there?" he asked. I knew he asked not to be bothered, but also knew he would want the gift more than he would want solitude. There was more rapping at the door, but no one answered him. He placed a light palm on the hilt of his sword in preparation.

"I asked who's there?"

More knocks. Leaves fell around me as I shook with anticipation. Oh how he would love the gift, and soon come to love me. He would ask who went through the power to get it to happen, then he would meet me and tell me I'm the most beautiful girl he'd ever met, and then... and then we'd get married!

The room creaked open as he pulled to it, then swung it open in shock. 

"Mo-- What are you?" he shrieked. I supposed that was to be expected, he hadn't seen her in years after all.

"Can't you recognize your own mother?" the person at the door asked, reaching her arms out for a hug. Now they would embrace. 

He pulled out his sword and held it to her throat. 

"Shapeshifter! I asked what you are!?" he cried.

This was going a little differently than planned. 

"Who is it, Yuin?" the little girl asked, rubbing tire from her eyes.

"Stay back Grace! It's a trick sent by my enemies!" my love responded, panic growing. That hurt a little bit, but I'm sure he'd understand soon.

"Sweetie, it's me," his reborn mother said sincerely, tears brimming her eyes. She took a hesitant step forward. 

"Another step and you die, shapeshifter! Answer me or leave us!" he demanded. 

"Yuin, it's--"

I screamed from my tree as I witnessed my creation's head leave her body. Yuin had his eyes screwed shut as he decapitated his mother. He looked down to her bloodless body and dropped his sword. When she didn't change form, it became clear to him that it wasn't a shapeshifter at all. Grace began to cry, not understanding what she had witnessed. Yuin wailed in agony.

"What kind of vile creature would do such a thing to my mother! Who would leverage the hallowed death she had to tear my mind to shreds!?" he screamed out the window. It hurt a lot to be a vile creature. I began to cry softly in my tree. 

Yuin was looking outside, but couldn't find me hiding. He kept looking between Grace and his mother, trying to make sense of it and began pulling hair from his head. I wanted to embrace him so! Be the calm that he needed! A maternal wing over his anguish!!

Then, I thought of another wonderful idea. Something that could calm him even at his worst. The love he needed. A figure stood up behind him and he turned horrified to see his mother resurrected once more. She held out her arms in an embrace just as she had before and he stood in shock this time as she approached him. I squealed with delight when they made contact!

Then I realized that her arms were around his neck, strangling him,

"You would murder me at my lowest point, Yuin!? You have always been a pathetic son, and deserve a quick death."

I shook my head, I should have known that she was a narcissist. That's why he was so shocked to see his mother. As she drained the life from him, I formulated a new plan to gain his attention. 

Perhaps the seventh time I resurrect him will be the charm.I looked at the note with consternation. I flipped it a couple of times, trying to see if I missed anything on the back. It was only a few minutes from noon, what was the harm in looking at the illegal parcel now? But if there was anyone I could trust, it was myself. I knew the business to well to be tricked into something that would cause me harm. Unless that's what the package was about.. what if it was a piece of my body from the future and--

"Excuse me, I'd like to place an order." 

I nearly fell out of my chair in shock before realizing it was just a customer. He was a younger man, eyes meandering over the different clothes on the wall of the shop. I got a hold of my nerves and moved my mail to the side professionally and went up to him.

"What can I get you?"

"How come all of your clothes on display are, like, normal clothes? Not like, old, but they're just clothes I could buy in any store. They're not vintage. How do I know you can make what I want?" he asked, still focusing on the fabric on the wall behind me.

"This is used as a reference point for time travelers. If they visit our time, the wall indicates what the normal attire of the time is so they can fit in more easily. I can assure you, I will be able to fulfill any need you have up to the year 5000," I said, clicking a pen and pulling out a paper. I couldn't tell if anything I said registered to him.

"Oh, right on. Umm.. do you do old clothes? Like old old clothes?" he asked, widening his arms for an effect that only made sense to him.

"You'll have to be a little more specific," I smiled.

"Like, old English? Fjords and stuff? Lords and fjords," he chuckled at the rhyme. I nodded my head, noting it down. "And like, it has to be 100 percent historically accurate. Can I count on that happening? It's important," he insisted.

"Yes, I assure you, we can--" I trailed off when I saw he wasn't even listening to my response. Still fixated on the clothes behind me. Something was compelling him to get this order. 

"What time are you traveling to?" I continued.

"Time?" 

"When are you traveling? What era? Who are you intending to meet?"

"Is this one of those time travel joints?" he asked, numbly. "I'm here for clothes."

"Yes!! What do you--" I caught myself before I lost patience. "We make clothes here. Sew them from scratch based on times that we've lived an studied in."

"Is Rennaissance a time?" he asked, finally holding eye contact without drifting. 

"Yes! That helps greatly! Are you intending to wear this yourself to a Renaissance time period?" I asked, happy to finally be getting somewhere.

"Nah, my friends and I wanted to visit the Rennaissance fair this weekend. But Grant doesn't want to go unless the whole group is wearing authentic clothes. I don't really care, but my dad told me this would be a good opportunity for me, so I went to the closest clothes thing on Google Maps," he said all in one breath.

I looked at him, waiting for him to break out in laughter. I don't think he understood how expensive this was or that he was wasting my time by his lack of wanting to jump times. 

"Sorry, uh, I can pay," he said, flashing a platinum credit card. I nodded begrudgingly. I couldn't turn him away.

"What would you like from the era?" I asked, my irritation seeping in.

"Something dark, and not super frilly, but *just* a little frilly."

"All right," I nodded, noting it should be dark.

"But not like stupid. It should look good."

"Of course."

"And, like, I want it to fit me good as well if you can do that," he said.

I nodded again.

"You got all that?" he asked.

"I do," I said, my teeth close to gritting together.

"You sure, cause I didn't see you write it all down and I don't want you to forget," he pointed to my notepad.

I looked at him with daggers in my eyes but rapidly went back to a pleasant smile, urging my rage to simmer down. I pretended to take a few more notes and let him know his bill. He didn't even look at the price before throwing the card on the counter and looking back to the clothes on the wall. I rung him up and placed the card back in his hand. He turned around without looking at me and called back as he passed through the door,

"Don't make it stupid like your clothes on the wall, okay?" 

I tore the merchant copy of the receipt in half. Then got mad at me and slammed myself into the seat behind the counter in a huff. I was about to scream in frustration before my eyes caught the time. Noon. My heart lept in unison with me jumping to the package. I tore it open to see a simple piece of newspaper clipping on it. I laughed aloud, first for the news, then for what I had done. I had sent myself something to cheer myself up in the past. I laughed until I ran out of breath, then laughed some more. 

On the clipping was an article that came out the day after the Rennaissance Fair. The customer who had just come in was covered in filth, my handiwork covered in what looked like either excrement or mud. He looked utterly humiliated, the opposite of his stance in here now. He was even crying in the photo! The title cleared up what was on him:

#From riches to rags: Heir to Hemloir Fortune covers himself and those around him in his explosive diarrhea!I hopped with surprise and felt my power reject me. Whenever I got scared, my first instinct was to stop time until I got control. But time was already stopped. My power rejected the second attempt.

"What? Who?" I asked. I didn't know how to react. I couldn't remember the last time I experienced this feeling. Fear. 

I turned rapidly, looking between the bodies of the train station. I was just trying to get off the train after having done my business for the day. Why did the time stop do something different now? I had never heard noise not coming from myself before. And between the focused looks of the frozen, exiting passengers, I couldn't get a read on who said anything. 

"Hello?" I said quietly, spinning even faster in place.

"I'd seen it before, you know. You disappearing from sight. One second you'd be sitting in your seat. The next, you'd disappear. First time, I thought my eyes played tricks on me. I was wondering why the seat next to me was left vacant when the whole train was packed! But it wasn't the one time. There were so many other instances, and you know what was common with every instance?"

I swallowed, making eye contact with an older man wearing a sweatshirt pulled up over his head. He held a sinister smile, like he'd waited his entire life for this moment. I stared at him, dumbfounded. My instincts were trying to convince me it was a dream, while my heart raged, desperately trying to escape this experience of fear.

"My wallet was missing a few bucks," he said, holding it up for effect. "Every single time. I would remember having something like seven dollars, but I only had three when I left at my stop. I thought it was some kind of crazed pickpocket. I guess I wasn't too far from the mark, huh?" he said, his teeth making a crazed appearance. 

I shook my head rapidly, trying to get control of myself.

"No, I-- I'm not who you think I am," I stuttered.

"Oh, it's some other person freezing time and snagging money from passengers every day, is it?" he said coyly.

"Umm.." was all I could get out. I started hyperventilating, my power pushing back with every instinctual attempt to stop time that had already stopped.

"You never figured out how it worked, did you?" he asked, picking a wallet out of a frozen purse next to him and stacking it on his own.

"W-- what?" I asked, watching him pull more wallet from more bags and pockets.

"You thought it was some power of yours, right? A birth-rite. Something that was part of your being! Well, I know how to tap into it. You're not special," he was approaching me now. His words were like slaps in the face. 

I couldn't move a muscle. I was just another mannequin frozen between the rest of scene of passengers making their way out. He stopped in front of me, opening my hands and placing the wallets in them. I shook my head, not understanding.

"The best discovery I made, was not only could I tap into it. But I could take it away!" he said with a laugh. His mania reached a crescendo as he slid a finger across my nose and made a jump back to where he was originally sitting. He snapped his fingers.

I screamed as all the passengers started moving again around me. I never deactivated my power. They shouldn't be moving. I continued to panic and tried to stop time again. It wouldn't work. I couldn't get the power to listen to me. I screamed again, this time other passengers looked my way. The hooded man looked at me with shock and screamed,

"Hey, my wallet!" pointing an accusing finger. More eyes turned on me that I couldn't turn away. I desperately tried once more to stop the motion of the world before my greatest fear came to pass. 

"Get him!" another passenger yelled, diving for me.

And I was caught.I pushed a few leaves out of the way to reveal a clearing not too far off my well-trodden path home. In the clearing was the familiar hand, floating around the clearing, seemingly frantic. After all its cajoling to bring me into the woods, I was a little underwhelmed at the sight before me. It seemed to just be going about the space, not having a direction in mind. Suddenly, it froze in place and then started waving. No, it was shooing me away. The hand that had enticed me to join it for months was telling me to leave. This only brought up more questions and I took another step toward it.

Suddenly, out of the sky came another detached limb that collided with the hand and pinned it to the ground. The hand stretched out, shaking in distress. I wanted to assist it but wasn't sure it was even in any need of help. It was held under a disembodied foot. The foot began rotating, further driving the hand into the ground. The hand was able to make it far out enough to shoo me away one more time before it was stomped on by the foot and again focused on escape. I acted without thinking and ran into the clearing, tackling the foot off the hand.

The foot stopped in place. Was it stunned? Then it faded away. The hand smacked me in the chest.

"Hey," I yelled, "I saved you, what's wrong with you?" 

I felt embarrassed as soon as I closed my mouth, having yelled at a hand for the spat it had with a foot. It softly tried to push me away from the clearing. 

"Why are you so intent on getting me away from you after spending so long--" I trailed off when I saw the hand pointing straight upward. I craned my neck to see two moons in the middle of the day. I was about to ask what they were when they both turned toward me. Massive eyes floating in the sky. Watching me. I yelped in fear and ran under a bush. 

"What is that?" I asked the hand, regretting everything that brought me to be under its gaze. The hand waved me away one more time before it faded away like the foot. I stared in disbelief, not sure what I was looking at was real. I peeked out from under the bush to see the eyes drifting toward me. Fast. I screamed again and began scrambling away on all fours, not wanting to let the eyes get any closer. But I couldn't escape the feeling of being watched. Every action to escape them was overshadowed by the constant shiver running down my spine and the foreboding sense that the eyes drew nearer. 

I risked looking over my shoulder one more time to see they were less than ten feet behind me, and both the size of a bus. I began crying out in fear, trying to pick up my pace, but something caught in my leg and I tripped. I looked down to see my foot had gone away. Below the eyes, a foot appeared. I put my arms up to shield me from its oppressive sight but was shocked to see one of my hands were gone. It appeared on one side of the eyes, encouraging me to flee. I wanted to scream, but my mouth had left me. One by one, each faculty I tried to use was taken from me, and the eyes drew ever nearer to me. 

By the time the eyes were less than an inch away, I was nothing more than eyes and a hand myself, floating in front of them. Tears dropped from me, but I could otherwise do nothing else to react. My limbs and body seemed to look sorry at my state of being, but they drifted off, leaving with the eyes they were taken by. 

I felt that in my state, I could do the same that was done to me. It was an instinct. This left me with nothing but to try and get my own body from someone else. I went behind a tree on the main road and waved an enticing finger at passerbys, trying desperately to get someone to come to the clearing to have their body taken."Mr. President... are we going to die?" my secretary asked. She was new. Reliable. Innocent. She wouldn't last the night. 

"We're going to be fine. Black Friday is nothing new, plenty of planets have survived before," I said, not meeting her gaze. I couldn't pull my attention away from the window. We both knew that was mostly a lie. Sure, the planets survived. The people weren't killed off. But without their resources, it wasn't long before they either starved to death or fled to another world. 

We placed everything of value into one large pile miles away from any city, yet here they were. Watching us. Their engines frothing at the mouth to get their hands on our planet. Anything that was or wasn't bolted down was going to be grabbed, sometimes from our hands and sometimes from their fellow humans. Thousands of humans would die, but that would mean nothing to the millions of trampled bodies that will be left of our employees. The ones brave enough to go out there and try to direct the hordes away from their loved ones. 

"What are we going--" she yelped as an explosion grew from just beyond our building. Two spaceships had crashed into one another trying to find themselves a better place in line. The infighting was already beginning and there was still so much time before opening. We watched silently as another ship greedily took the spot of the explosion and revved its engine loudly. It was likely it would crash straight into the planet, killing thousands. Anything for Black Friday.

"Can't... can't we fight back?" she asked quietly, already sounding defeated.

"With the Haldro Cannon? It's far too expensive. It would call the attention of thousands-- millions of them! The Refractor would do the same. I don't think we own a single technology that is worth less than any of their annual salaries. No, I don't think fighting would be in our best interest," I said, finally looking at her dejected face. Her eyes were wet, but she must have been wiping away the tears while my back was turned. Reliable as ever. Even now, trying to put on a brave face for me.

"How many are there?" she said, looking beyond me. The only light from outside was from the lights that were installed on our roads. The sun was entirely blacked out by the sheer mass of humans. All waiting in line for the planet to open. 

"Is it really in the millions?" she asked.

"Billions," I corrected. Another explosion. We both cringed. More engines revving with excitement. We were less than five minutes away from the opening.

"But the preparations we made! Putting out employees and training them to keep the humans in an orderly fashion for the day! Our courteousness will surely show through and influence the humans, will it not? We prepared for months! They can't take away the morale we created in one day's time!" she said. Another explosion punctuated her declaration and she shrank into herself, knowing that she was only speaking to reassure herself from the inevitable.

I floated over to the podium with the planetary communicator. Two minutes from opening, I wanted to make one last announcement. One last plea for them to remain orderly and gather at our designated places before they were left to their own devices. I switched the microphone and felt the silence between me and the horde. 

"Greetings to one and all. Welcome to the planet of--" I was drowned out by the roar of the ships accelerating toward the planet. 

"They're coming in! We haven't given them the all clear! Mr. President!" she yelled hysterically, hyperventilating between looking at me and the growing mass of ships approaching us. 

"Evidently, they took the beginning of my announcement to be an invitation to invade-- er, come in," I said. Despite the growing deafening noise, I felt my lips curve upwards. It was amusing to think about the fact that humans did this every year. Sure it was a good deal for them, but the cost had to have outweighed the benefits. But that didn't stop them. In fact, it seemed to get bigger every year. 

I saw my secretary waving at me manically, probably trying to get me to go to the bunker with her, but I simply shook my head. I was the manager of this planet. This was my fate. I signaled for her to flee as a grappling hook launched itself through my window and laid claim to my podium. I stepped back, allowing it to be taken without a fight. I saw another hook bury itself into the first and the two ships began to fight over it. 

I looked around the room as it was cleared out of its contents. My secretary was gone, and I couldn't tell if she was taken or was able to flee in time. A ship veered into the building and shook it to its core, tearing away a large chunk of the room I stood in. 

Another ship came charging toward me. Whether to kill me or grab me, I couldn't tell. The last words I heard were my own, playing on repeat on a speaker in the street outside. 

"Please remain in an orderly fashion while joining us for Black Friday. Thank you for shopping with us!"I gripped the grass beneath me as tightly as I could, tearing it from its roots. This was real grass. Nothing was floating around. The air didn't burn to breathe, but most of all, there was someone speaking to me in a language I actually understood. 

"Hey, are you listening to me?" he asked sternly.

I pulled some of the grass up to my face and inhaled deeply, remembering its fragrance. I looked up at them and nodded. His eyebrows drew together a little worried, but he didn't miss a beat. 

"I said you can't be here. The sign says 'Please Stay Off The Grass' right over there," he said pointing. It read some glyphs that I had long forgotten. I wondered if the glyphs were in any of the other realities. I stared at him for couple more seconds before hobbling over to him on the sidewalk. He looked down on me, not sure whether to glare or to be scared.

"Look, I'm sorry, I know you're--" he faltered, but went for it, "I know you're homeless, but we still have to keep up the rules. Do you have a place to sleep tonight?" he asked nicely.

*Sleep? Sleep tonight?*

No! I couldn't possibly do that. If I slept tonight I would be lost to the ages again. The infinite universes, with infinite horrors. The lack of any semblance of sense or sanity spanning across all the different realities. My eyes shook in horror. 

"Mumf," I barked. My tongue forgot how to work. I don't remember the last time I had the opportunity to use it to speak to anyone. 

"Ml-pla. Plee," I coughed. I couldn't figure out how it worked. 

"Do you know what I'm saying? Do you need me to take you somewhere? I know a shelter nearby," he offered, his eyebrows sliding away from each other as he looked to me with genuine compassion.

"Can't!" I forced out. He looked at me disappointed but waited for me to continue.

"Can't sleep!" I said, proud of my coming this far.

"Ah, that's normal. I have insomnia, too. I'm sure they have pills for maintaining restful sleep overni--"

"Noo!" I threw the grass back on the lawn behind me, frustrated. "*Can't* sleep!" I said, forgetting how to construct any sort of sentence to explain my situation. I didn't even know what 'insomnia' was. He wrung his hands together.

"Look, I'm trying to help you, just let me.." he reached a hand out toward me and I slapped it away, tumbling back onto the lawn. He took another step toward me, but I thrashed around, making sure he wouldn't lay a hand on me. 

"Alright, but you can't be on the grass, I already told you that," he said, donning his aggressive voice once again. He reached to his pocket slowly. 

I looked at him with daggers in my eyes and tore some more grass from the lawn. He was trying to hurt me and I would hurt him back through his precious grass.

"I'm warning you!" he screamed, pulling something out of his pocket and pointing it at me. 

There was nothing he could do to me, no pain he could inflict on me that would cause me more suffering than the time I spent in the multiverse. I jumped around on the grass and taunted at him, daring him to do his worst. Killing me would be a blessing compared to--

A dart stuck out of my chest, flooding me with fatigue.

"No.." I whispered. "No! No! No!" I begged, crawling at his legs and pulling out the dart. My eyelids were crashing down over and over and my limbs started refusing to cooperate. 

I was falling asleep.

"I'm sorry, you left me no choice. I had to tranquilize you."

I didn't know what that meant. All I knew was that he doomed me. 

"Don't worry," he assured, "when you wake up, you'll be in a much better home.""Oops," I shrugged, looking over the door. The doorknob was being crushed simply by my holding it.

"AAAHHHH!!" a woman -- my neighbor -- screamed. "That monster broke into that man's house!"

"Ha, no you misunderstand Marcy," I chuckled, holding one hand up innocently while dropping the door from the other. Me raising my hand sent a torrent of wind at her so powerful that she was blown off the second floor and collapsed on the first floor with a loud *snap.*

A man walking his dog was dumbfounded at the display. His dog started barking at me as the woman began crying in unadulterated pain.

"My-- my legs!" she stammered, "They're broken! He's on a rampage!!"

"HELP!!" the man cried to the street. I heard a car screech to a halt. Then sirens from around the corner. 

"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to! I can carry you to a hospital!" I called down, jumping over the railing. My landing was massive, causing the floor to shake and crack below Marcy. She cried out even louder in pain, unable to make intelligible sounds anymore.

"He's torturing her!" the man with the dog yelled to whoever was around the corner, pointing at me. I heard hard footsteps of a man coming towards me. The dog barked louder, pulling against his leash.

"No! That's not it at all!" I pleaded, taking a hesitant step toward her. The floor's crack opened wider and swallowed the bottom half of Marcy's body. She screamed for a moment before going entirely limp and passing out. The dog fought maniacally against his owner's leash until he slipped away and came charging at me, teeth bared.

"Rex, no!" the man screamed. Rex made a magnificent leap over the crack in the floor and bit into my leg. All of his teeth cracked on contact. He yelped and whined painfully, blood spilling from his mouth, but he hung on with ferocity. 

"Rex! Come back! Please don't fight that thing!" his owner begged. 

"You should go back," I said, quietly to the dog. I knelt to get closer to it, but the flexing of my legs snapped its jaw. It crumpled to the floor, unconscious. "Oops," I whispered.


"Reeeeexx!" his owner fell to the floor, cursing me. 

Suddenly, two officers came around the corner and looked at the scene. A woman in shock and a dog bleeding at my feet. 

"Isn't that Mighty Man? I thought he only went after criminals!" one said to the other, panicked. The other pulled his gun on me.

"This is what we get for giving a blind eye to vigilante justice! Hands up, Mighty!" he screamed. I complied, causing more wind to whip at them. 

"He's attacking, fire!!" the man holding the gun yelled quickly. He fired three shots, all of which ricocheted off my chest and hit his partner, himself, and the building I jumped from. The only man still alive and conscious was the man crying across the street, mourning his dog's condition. I took in the scene with horror of my power.

*Oops.*I looked up to it, its form unclear through the tears stacked in my eyes. It loomed over me like a great, spindly tree. It closely resembled a shadow. I blinked a few times, trying to get a clearer view, but the more I focused my eyesight, the less I could make out of its form. Its face kept fuzzing, like it was a poorly recorded figure, but in it I could make out an emotion. Compassion.

"Not really," I said. It reached down and wiped the tears from my cheeks. 

"What happened?" it asked, warping ahead and swatting down its massive legs. Even when sitting, its head was a few feet above mine, ever shifting itself.

"I failed my final. Totally bombed it. In the one class that was a pre-req for almost everything!! And I studied all--" my throat caught as I fought back another flow of tears.

It nodded solemnly. 

"Were you there?" I asked. "Watching me fall apart in there?" 

It nodded again, its face fueling the emotion of regret now. 

"What are you?"

It shrugged nonchalantly, its arms rising above me before returning to its original position. I heaved a great sigh and reached its arm to pat my back again. It felt nice.

"What are you doing here?" I pressed.

It looked to the building where I finished my Chem 103 exam and shifted its chin upwards sharply. 

"I am here because I come when things are just out of reach. Not quite gone, but not quite there," it answered stoically.

"So you left me as a child because I started to get a grasp on the world?"

It nodded.

"And you're here because... because I was so close to the right answers on the final?" I asked hopefully.

"But not quite there," it nodded, wincing at my feeling of dejection. I really failed. I completely messed this thing up.

"Then... if you only show up when I'm just out of reach of something, then why are you here now? The exam is over."

"You are trying to figure out what to do with your life. You have no idea what you want to do now, but you know what you are passionate about." I could almost see its eyes piercing into me. I hadn't considered it being put so succinctly like that, but he was absolutely right.

"So, what now?" I asked, hoping it would give me more.

"I wait for you to decide what you want." It nodded encouragingly.

"I don't-- I have no idea! Chem was supposed to lead me to chemical engineering and then to something with like gasoline studies or something. I wanted to discover something! Something new! I don't know anymore! I can't afford another year here."

"No," it agreed.

"And I want to do something new..." I said again slowly, trailing as I saw its form shimmering before me. As I became more confident in my decision, it was leaving to the corners of my vision. 

"Best of luck," it whispered from where I couldn't see it.

I wanted to know everything there was to know about that creature.The men tilling the field looked up to the sky the same time as I did, sweat rolling off our necks and backs as waterfalls. It was the hottest summer on record for the twelfth year in a row, and I could feel it heating my bones. The heat had finally driven me to insanity, I thought I heard someone yell about a thermostat here on the farmland. I wiped my face of its moisture and glanced at the others in the field. They remained fixated on the sky. Had they heard it too?

"Timmy?" the voice boomed, shaking me to my core. One of the workers dropped his tools and ran to the barn. Another dropped to his knees.

"Y..yeah Dad?" another voice exploded across the sky. It was of a higher pitch and sounded anxious. 

"We've done it now! We broke the sky itself!" one of the workers shouted, pointing to the sky weakly. I shrugged and continued to stare at nothing.

"Why is it set to 120 degrees?" the first voice boomed again.

"I..." the one word rang in the air as the second voice hesitated, "I got cold," it admitted. 

"Cold?" the first voice asked in exasperation, "you have no idea what cold is! You think this is cold!? Let me show you *real* cold--"

"Dad, please don't--"

"No, no, it'll be good for you. You'll get to experience your first Ice Age. It'll go by quick, I promise, but I just want you to be grateful for what it is you consider cold," the first voice concluded. 

"Okay, fine Dad. Please don't make it too long," the more innocent voice pleaded.

"No more than a million years, I promise," the voice said.

Those of us on the field looked to one another in disbelief of what we heard around us. Nothing happened for what felt like an hour as we were frozen in place, wracking our minds for an explanation of what just happened. When I finally got the bravery to speak to my fellow men, we heard a sharp *click* pass over us, sending a shiver down my spine. 

The shivering didn't stop. The moisture that was rolling down my skin moments before solidified into ice. I sprang toward the barn, the only thing that I could think would shelter me in the moments the temperature was dropping drastically.

It was time for real cold._____________________________________________

Like a hailstorm, the shower of beaks assailed the outside of the car, each hit bringing another small zit on the roof of the car. The rear window began to crack. Scar pranced about the hood of the car excitedly. The interior of the car felt like it was closing in on us. Mostly because it was.

Boss had hopped up to my shoulder to try and speak to Scar, but his voice was still far too weak. He Settled for just glaring at him.

"Uhhh," Officer Daniels said loudly, looking all over the car as the damage became worse. The back window began caving in and the passenger window had a quickly growing crack appear on it.

"Hit the gas!" I screamed. "Are windows on cop cars bulletproof?" I followed up, watching the crack on the rear window closely.

"No, that's just a myth, why would you ask--"

Something finally clicked in her head when a beak poked its way through the top of the car and she smashed her hand down on the car horn. The birds were startled by the blare for a moment and a few jumped away.

"What was that for, just drive!" I screamed as the birds resumed their assault.

"I wanted to make sure no pedestrians were in the way!" she screamed back. The back window broke open and a crow stuck its head in, cawing crazily.

The tires screeched and the car sped forward with a sudden lurch, leaving behind the hundreds of birds. The crow with its head in the window screamed at us, trying to force the rest of its body in the small space of the hole in the window. The windows were mostly obscured by excrement, and the windshield wipers did little to help. Daniels drove slower than I would have thought. She turned on the sirens.

"Why aren't we going faster?" I yelled, Boss chirping in agreement. I closed my eyes and slapped down on the crow, sending it flying out the back. I didn't look to see whether I'd killed that one as well.

"I can barely see out the window and I don't want to hit--"

The birds caught up and were pecking and scratching whatever they could of the car in pursuit of us. A few were able to make significant contact with the vehicle, but most could hardly keep up.

Boss tweeted and raised his wing, indicating to the street ahead.

"Make a right!" I said. She obliged without a moment's hesitation, skidding along the road.

Before we could get on a straight path again, a small explosion threw us to one side, smacking me, Daniels, and Boss against the windows closest to us. I felt more blood flow down my forehead, complementing the blood drying on my ear from earlier. The car lurched forward again, speeding up much faster than earlier. The whole car felt like it slanted to one side. Boss looked around in a daze.

"What was that?" I asked her, looking at the remaining birds following us. We were finally making creating space between us now that we were moving faster.

"I don't believe-- They popped a tire!" she yelled back, looking at one of the side-view mirrors. 

"Bird beaks aren't strong enough to pop tires, though!" I said.

"I didn't say what they popped it with, I just said it was popped!" she said loudly in response.

"Well then what did they use?" I asked, feeling relief start to creep in as we got further from our pursuers.

"I don't know!" she yelled.

I dropped it and let her concentrate on driving. The sirens allowed us to make good time bypassing a few traffic lights and stop signs. My eyes were glued to the mass of birds behind us. The cloud waned the further we went, but it didn't let up.

"You want to tell me what's going on?" Daniels asked, the frustration from earlier still coating her voice. 

I thought about how best to explain it, but so much had happened in such a short period of time. Boss tweeted and raised his wing again.

"Turn left up ahead," I said.

"What? We want to be driving away from the things, not sideways!" 

Boss insisted.

"Please?" I asked. She grunted and begrudgingly made the left turn.

"Tell me what's happening!" she said more forcefully. "I want to call back up but I'd rather have something plausible to work with before I tell them about an army of evil-- Before I have to say anything stupid."

"Okay, okay," I swallowed hard. "Umm, this morning-- well I guess it starts like three days ago when I first got Boss. I found him--"

"Oh my God!!" Daniels screamed as a truck tried to race across the intersection perpendicular to the police car. Daniels pulled the wheel to one side and I felt the whole vehicle tilt.

The car careened to one side. I grabbed Boss protectively, unsure what was going to happen until we smashed into something on the opposite side of where we sat. The car has come to a complete stop. We crashed into a traffic light. I looked back out over my shoulder and saw the flock gradually making its way toward us. We had minutes.

"We have to go, get us out!" I yelled. I didn't want to look away from the mass but didn't hear anything from Daniels.

"Daniels?"

I turned around and saw her slumped over and passed out over the steering wheel. We were locked inside.
