NOTE: All 4 parts are now up!I'm thinking there'll be a couple more parts max to this story (like probably 4-6 more).Meanwhile, if you're interested in checking out another one of my stories, I'm currently writing an RPG-fantasy story called Digital Phantom (the blurb can be found on the sidebar).Thanks for reading!*****

The light came on.Rina froze, her foot poised above the stair step.She slowly stood up straight and turned around.Her mother, in all her bushy-haired, spectacled glory, stood there, hands crossed over her chest, glaring at her only daughter."Where were you?And what are you wearing?"Rina gingerly pulled back the hood of her white cloak."Nowhere, mom.And nothing.""You're coming in at 10 p.m. without even an 'I was practicing my incantations' explanation and you expect me to believe that?"Suddenly, she walked up, taking a corner of the cloak in her hand and examined the stitch work."I recognize this pattern.This is the cloak the members of the church across town wear.You joined a clergy?""No."She said, expressionless.Her mother blinked, then brought her hand up.A swirling ball of black mist slowly appeared within her palm, and before Rina's eyes, it began to take form, separating into little flickers of life.Rina's eye twitched.Finally, she broke down."Okay, I was at the church!"Her mother had a terrible habit of conjuring up undead wasps whenever she was unhappy.If getting stung by a single wasp was bad, imagine getting stung by tens of undead wasps that couldn't be killed.Paddling had nothing on her mother.The ball of black mist disappeared."Okay," Her mother picked up a large tome from the desk and made for her bedroom, her black cloak swishing behind her."Wait, that's it?"The words popped out of her mouth unbidden.Not that she wanted to be punished, but she had thought her mother would have been completely against her joining the clergy.Her mother turned around.She shrugged."That's it.""Wait.What?"Her mother blew on a fingernail, examining it."I was going to ask Pastor Jeremiah to take you in anyway in a couple weeks time.Saved me the time and effort.""I thought you hated the clergy?""Oh, good lord, no."She laughed at her little joke."That's how I got my start.How can you understand death if you can't understand life?Besides, where do you think you were made?"Rina took a step back, bumping into the dining room chair.She definitely didn't want to know.She would probably be scarred for life.Her mother walked up anyway, and whispered the words next to her ear."In the confession booth."Then, she strode into her bedroom and closed the door behind her, leaving Rina standing there, stock-still, wondering if she tore out her ears, if she could un-hear what she had just heard.&nbsp;

"Your mom actually said that?"Bastian donned his cloak and stood there, waiting as Rina slid her sleeves into her own and grabbed her spell orb.He looked at the confession booth across the cathedral with new eyes."If I lie about this, may God smite me where I stand.""You're so blasphemous sometimes I wonder what the pastor sees in you."Rina flicked her hair over her shoulder and batted her eyelashes at her best friend of ten years."My undeniable charm and riveting spell-casting, of course."Bastian snorted."If by riveting spell-casting you mean your ability to create a plant that's *literally in suspended animation* i.e.not alive and not dead--which, by the way makes no sense because that's not even a thing and I'm convinced Pastor John is just covering for you by bringing out some frozen plant so he doesn't get on your mom's bad side--then yeah, you can spell-cast."Rina rolled her eyes."Whatever, you just don't understand my talents."She filed behind him as they sat down in the pews to await the pastor's arrival.Tuesdays and Thursdays at ten were spell lessons with Pastor John, and she had been a dedicated student here for about two months now thanks to her rebellious streak.Anything to spite her mom.Even after that conversation, she was too deep now to give up.A couple of students in front of them laughed as one of them conjured up a puppy.Kael.She internally sighed.Of course it was him.He was the pastor's star pupil, a golden boy who managed to bring alive anything he touched.Well, not that he looked it, with his spiky black hair and grey eyes.He had the looks of a descendent of the Napali clan, who were known not only for their wide influence in the necromancy world, but also their devastatingly good looks."You're staring again.""Shut up."She smacked Bastion in the back of the head and secretly vowed to ask her mom for the incantation for how to conjure an undead wasp.The doors to the cathedral burst open.Everyone grew silent, turning around to see who was making such a commotion.It was Pastor Jeremiah, who strode down the nave toward the pulpit.His face was pale, and he walked with a slight limp.When he passed by Rina, he gave her an unnameable look.When he reached the pulpit, he took a deep breath.His fingers shook as he reached into his cloak for his canteen.He wasn't a drinker, but if there was ever a time... 

Pastor Jeremiah looked down at the students, all fifteen of them.His lips trembled."Class is dismissed for today.In addition, this class will be suspended until further notice."He seemed to hesitate, then he closed his eyes, swallowing hard."Pastor John is dead.Please pay your respects however you wish."In the silence filled with shock and disbelief that followed, he turned his gaze toward the left side of the pews."Rina, Kael, follow me.I need you two to see something."&nbsp;

***** 

&nbsp;

Rina gasped, involuntarily taking a step back as she clapped a hand to her mouth.A black lightning fractal pattern ran down the pastor's frail body, the burn mark stretching from his left shoulder all the way onto his right leg, as if God himself had smote him down.More horrifying was that he was floating in mid-air, his body tethered onto an invisible cross, head tilted back.His eyes were an electric blue, mouth wide open, as if in the final throes of a scream.But what Rina's eyes were drawn to, and what her gaze couldn't leave, was the mark seared into his forehead, the mark that still seemed to burn, the red and black lines swirling and surging.It was in the shape of two outward facing crescent moons that overlapped slightly, with a slash going down the center and three dots around each end of the slash.In the space between the moons, a star.Rina shut her eyes tightly, then opened them again.No.It wasn't possible.It was her clan crest--the Lyngrave family's symbol.The footsteps behind her barely registered in her mind, as did the hand on her shoulder.Everything seemed to be hidden behind a fog.She couldn't think."Rina..." The voice spoke.She turned, her eyes hollow.It was Pastor Jeremiah, and he was looking at her with an expression of pity on his face.Why was he looking at her like that?She didn't need to be pitied."No one here believes that your mother would do such a thing.I've treated her like a daughter.But she's been missing, and no one can reach her..." 

Rina blinked."That's not an admission of guilt," she snapped."I saw my mother just last night.She would never do this, I could stake my life on it.She's only ever used her powers for good."She shrugged off the Pastor's hand, her fists clenching.Her mother would never break the Forsworn's agreement to only use necromancy for good."Yes, of course."Pastor Jeremiah hesitated.When he spoke, his voice was soft."But the fact remains that she's not here to claim her innocence, and you two are the only ones left in your clan."He looked around the clearing, then at the circle that had been seared into the ground around the dead pastor."I didn't get to see whoever it was.They were cloaked and they left immediately when I came."He cradled his left hand against his chest, and it was the first time Rina noticed the blackened cloth that covered his hand."Rina, please."Her gaze snapped up to his face.To the blue eyes filled with kindness despite the fact that her mother might be the worst type of murderer and the laugh lines that were now creased with worry for her.Pastor Jeremiah then looked toward Kael."She doesn't have anywhere to go.Can she invoke the Auxilium clause of the Forsworn?"Kael nodded."The Napali clan would be happy to take her in until this is resolved."Rina whipped around.Wasn't Kael just a clergyman's son?She had never seen him at the clan meetings before, so how was he suddenly a necromancer?He looked at her then, his grey eyes clear, and he nodded slightly in acknowledgment."Rina, I'll take you to see my father.He'll take care of this."She made to follow him.Then she looked back at Pastor Jeremiah.He was gazing up at Pastor John with such a look of desolation and grief in his eyes that she stopped.How could she leave him alone like this?The sudden movement caught his attention, and he tore his gaze away from the pastor, giving her a weak smile."Go.We'll get to the bottom of this, I swear.Until then, it's best you stay with the Napali clan.They'll keep you safe."&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Rina took in everything around her in awe as Kael led her down the hallway to the tearoom.In spite of everything unbelievable that had happened--or perhaps because of it--the opulence still managed to shock her.She could, perhaps, ignore the large fountain and the garden filled with trimmed, artistic hedges, and maybe she could disregard the towering Roman pillars that lined the entranceway.She could probably even pass over the foyer with the crystal chandelier without making too much of a fuss.But the tearoom.Had she time travelled back to Victorian England without her knowledge?He gestured to the floral couch that occupied the middle of the room."You can sit here.I'll go get my father."Rina nodded, then sat down.She glanced around at the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves that lined the walls, each bookshelf bookended by a marble statue.One wall consisted entirely of a glass window that overlooked the back garden.Just as she was about to get up and examine the books on the bookshelves more closely, the door opened, and two cloaked figures walked in.One was Kael.The other, Rina recognized from the council meetings.He had close-cropped hair and the signature Napali grey eyes, and although his hair was greying now and there were hints of wrinkle lines around his mouth and forehead, he must've been quite handsome when he was younger.He was still handsome, but he had an steely aura about him that gave her pause.He walked up to her and smiled, making as if to extend his right hand, then switching to the left at the last second.She stood up and shook his hand."Nice to meet you, Mr.Napali.""Please, call me Viktor."He walked over to the other side of the couch and sat down.Rina followed.Kael simply leaned against the wall by the door, silent, his gaze unflinching as he stared out the window.He looked like a soldier."I heard about the situation with your mother from my son, and you and Aliza have my deepest condolences."He bent his head slightly in the form of a bow, and Rina awkwardly reciprocated, a small jerk of her head forward that made her feel like a chicken."You are welcome to stay with us as long as you need.Please treat this place like your own home.I've also made arrangements for you to join in on Kael's incantations lessons."Rina shook her head."Oh!That really won't be necessary, thank you.I'm already intruding enough as is, and I'm so grateful you're letting me into your wonderful home.""You'll be joining in on his lessons.It wouldn't do to let you fall behind."His voice was stern.Rina closed her mouth.For some odd reason, despite his kindly manner, Viktor intimidated her in a way that her mother never did, even with the wasps.She felt a pang of sorrow.Where had her mother gone?"Kael will take you to your room."Viktor stood up and made to head out.Then he turned back around."There is one last matter.The Forsworn cannot be without a leader.Tomorrow, the council will meet to appoint another leader.You should be there.""My mother's not dead."Rina looked at him, her gaze firm.A hint of respect seemed to flicker in his eyes, but it was gone in a moment, to be replaced with an appraising gaze as he took in her appearance.He blinked, then awkwardly extended a hand out to pat her shoulder kindly, the gesture seemingly foreign and uncomfortable."Yes, of course.I meant a leader pro tempore will be appointed in your mother's absence.I had no intentions of implying she was dead."Then, he nodded again and left the room, his black cloak swishing behind him.After he left, Kael pushed himself off the wall and fixed his grey eyes on her, the depths swirling with kindness and pity."Come on, I'll show you to your room.You should get a good rest tonight.Tomorrow's going to be rough."***** 

Part 5 is up now!

Ding.*Zero.*

Okay.He didn't expect Uncle Bobby to have killed anyone.He was a kind old man who had raised his children well.Ding.*Zero.*

Aunt Maria as well.Ding.*Zero.*

Craig's number came as a bit of a surprise.Zachary had always pegged the tattooed playboy as the most likely to have murdered someone or at the very least accidentally decapitated someone unwittingly.But he supposed Craig wasn't as bad as he thought after all.Zachary's gaze swept across the different members of his extended family.Digging up family secrets had become his favorite pastime over the last couple of family gatherings.Aunt Matilda had starred in a porno in her youth.Uncle Freddie had shot someone in a duel--luckily, no one had died.But there was nothing truly bizarre.He lazily glanced over at his younger sister, who sat on the floor playing with her toy truck.Charlie blew bubbles out of her mouth as she rolled the tiny truck back and forth on the rug, one chubby arm waving about frantically as the other kept a tight grip on the small piece of plastic.His gaze softened, his heart melting as he watched her roll around on the carpet.She meant everything to him.He often unabashedly told his friends that he loved his little sister with his entire being and that he would kill for her, even if it meant they ribbed him about it constantly.But he wasn't ashamed.There was no reason to be.*Number of people killed.* 

Ding.*Zero.*

He chuckled to himself.Of course.She was a baby.But then his gaze shot back to the small blue line, almost imperceptible, underneath the search bar.*Did you mean: Number of future people killed?*  

He had never seen a recommendation before.Zachary hesitated, the sound of Uncle Jeremy shouting about the football match results fading into a dull hum.*Number of future people killed,* he allowed himself to think.The small ding that accompanied the search results had never felt so loud.A chill shot down his spine.*Eight Billion.*

No.That was impossible.That was...that had to be almost everyone.This was some kind of sick joke.Zachary frantically repeated his thought, watching the search results fill in over and over again with the exact same number.So maybe the number was a glitch, he thought, frenzied.His eyes brightened, his chest expanding with hope.*Number of future people saved.* 

Maybe it was like one of those science fiction scenarios where people were cryogenically frozen, or the brains were saved, so they technically died, only they didn't.Ding.*One.* 

His hands fell to his side as he read the small blue print beneath.*Did you mean: Zachary Galanis?* 

His mind blanked.He was willing to do anything for his sister.Destroy the world if need be, although he'd always thought that was more of a metaphor.&nbsp;

It turned out she was willing to do the same for him.

The members of the council filed in, a swarm of black cloaks that resembled bees in a hive.And a hive they were indeed, ten strong.But now only nine formed the circle around the table.Besides the official members, only direct kin could be present in the meeting, though they werent allowed to speak.Rina stood beside Kael, taking comfort in his presence.She had only been present at one meeting before, and that was when the last leader had passed the role to her mother.Bastion couldnt attend; he was once-removed from the current head of the Ensmore clan.He often joked that he wouldnt want to see a bunch of old farts being pompous anyway.But she knew he was secretly just as curious about what went on in the meetings as she was.The room was furnished similarly to the tearoom, except this one was hidden unground and only accessible by a singular elevator that opened into the room itself.The secrecy was truly astounding.When everyone had filed in, Viktor nodded, and Kael walked toward the bookshelf by the elevator, pulling a simple glass tray off of it.He set the tray at the center of the table, and the leader of each clan pulled a small orb the size of a golfball from the sleeve of their cloak and set it on the tray.The orbs gently pulsed, their depths swirling with shadows, each tinged a different color.It was vital that the leaders have them; the orbs symbolized their leadership status and gave them the right to stand at the table.The orbs also gave them the ability to brand the spirits of the rites, allowing the necromancer to form a stronger bond with the spirit.It was why they had accused her mother for Pastor Johns death.For anyone else, only a faint symbol would be visible somewhere on the spirit's body whenever it was used in a summoning.But the one on Pastor John's had been seared deeply into his skin--a testament to the strength of the bond.That, and combined with the fact that the pastor, despite being old and frail, was quite a powerful Cleric in his own right, meant only a highly powerful necromancer could have killed him.Viktor stood up.Im sure youve all heard of what happened.Aliza has gone missing, and in light of recent events, its necessary we appoint a leader to speak to the Clergy on behalf of the Forsworn. 

Aliza has been missing for less than 48 hours.Shouldnt we give her more time? A woman whose purple hair was smoothed back into a severe bun spoke up.Vera Grindell: a necromancer known for her peculiar ability to extract information like time of death and surrounding conditions from dead plants.Highly useful for tracking.The clergy will want an explanation. The speaker was Corin Bolthorn: a tall, thin man with gaunt cheekbones and deep-set eyes.People knew him as the Interrogatora title well deserved.Though the dead often remained stubborn in what information they were willing to impart, he always had a way of making them give up more than the corpses themselves consciously knew.A master of psychology, he delved deep into their subconscious.Her leaving is an admission of her guilt.We should just appoint a new leader altogether, the plump woman sitting next to Viktor spat, her eyes a fiery blue.Mireya Clement had just been appointed not long ago, and she still sought to prove herself to not only the council but her clan members as well.What is your opinion on the matter? Viktor turned his gaze toward Rina.She glanced around, but the faces around the table were expressionless.No clues for how she should respond.When she locked gazes with Kael, he seemed to tense, wanting to say something, but in the end, his jaw merely clenched for a second before relaxing.I guess its important to maintain good relations with the Clergy? Did her opinion really matter?Viktor nodded.Then its settled.I would be happy to take over the position, if no one has any objections? His head turned as he made eye contact with each leader.No one spoke up.They curiously averted their gazes when his gaze fell on them.Then he turned back to Rina.Rina? 

How should she even respond?The silence thickened, the tension in the room palpable as everyone seemed to await her response.Kaels eyes were piercing as he jerked his head toward her.Um, sure. He closed his eyes at her answer, and she bit her lip, feeling shaken by his behavior.What was wrong with him?Viktor visibly relaxed, and a small smile graced his face.Good, were in agreement then. 

The meeting adjourned relatively quickly after the leaders discussed what explanation to give the Clergy.Then, each took their orb from the tray, and the room cleared out.Perhaps it was Kaels strange behavior, but as Rina walked back to her room, she couldnt help but feel a niggling doubt that something was amiss.He had disappeared the second the meeting adjourned, so she would simply have to ask him about it tomorrow morning.It was night now, and her room was dark.She sat down at the edge of the bed and glanced out the large window at the sky, at the stars that shone so brightly against the darkness.When she was younger, her mother had told her tales about how the stars would guide sailors home.Her heart suddenly ached, a feeling so intense it threatened to smother her.It was stupid to get angry with her mother just because she was sick of hearing about necromancy.All her mother wanted was for her to learn.Maybe if she hadnt tried to join the Clergy, none of this would be happening.She rolled over on the bed and buried her face into the blankets, squeezing her eyes tightly shut.*Im sorry, mom.So come back.*

*Please.*

"DO NOT LEAVE TOWN TODAY."At first, the rule didn't raise any eyebrows.There was nothing particularly unusual about it, one of the same ones along the lines of "Don't go into the forest," or "Don't buy the bakery's bread."No one really knew how the rules appeared on the side of Abe's barn every day, but the town prophet had foreseen that if anyone didn't follow the rules, the entire town of Wolford would be punished.So it was sort of like God's commandment, if you will.And the rules were never terrible.Oh, sure, they could get a little inconvenient at times, like this one, but it was always only for a day and quite easily avoidable.Or so everyone thought, including Libby, who had lived in the town her entire life.Until the next day, the rule was the same."DO NOT LEAVE TOWN TODAY."Panic ensued as all the members of the community gathered in front of the dripping red paint on the barn door."How is this possible?"Tom asked, stricken."I need to go out and sell milk today, or it'll go bad soon.""Same," Bradford huffed through his mustache."I need to buy flour and other materials to keep running the bakery.""This has never happened before," Cindy added.She clutched at the small baby she held in her arms, her eyes wide."Should we ask Sylvia what to do?"Voices began overlapping and talking over each other when, as Libby was watching the red paint, still wet, suddenly had a thought."What if this is a practical joke?How do we know Sylvia's prophecies are even correct?"A hush fell over the crowd as dozens of pairs of eyes stared at her.Libby shrunk in front of the glares.It seemed a valid question.After all, Sylvia hadn't really gotten anything right before, and everyone had viewed her as a quack until the command "Don't laugh" appeared on the wall, and some did, and then that night, the town was visited by a swarm of locusts.Sylvia claimed it was God's command.But couldn't it all have been a coincidence?The prophet now had the townsfolk lined up in front of her door every morning--bartering items in hand--to have their fortunes told."Don't talk as if you know anything.You're still young," Bradford grunted."I'm 23," Libby shot back."Old enough to question whether we might be following some jokester's rule.""Libby!"Her mother appeared at the back and grabbed at her arm.She bowed and looked apologetically at the rest of the group."She's still young, and she doesn't understand the rules, that's all.""Momma!Don't apologize!""You better teach her to watch her mouth, darlin'.She's gonna get in huge trouble one day runnin' it like that."Libby glared at the bartender.Bradford had always been crude and leery, and she was certain he had something for her mother."I will," her mother said.Then she dragged Libby away from the crowd."You know you shouldn't say things like that.""But momma, it's all backwards.This thinking, it's like we're stuck in the middle ages or something."She had wanted to speak up on the issue for forever, but her mother had curbed her tongue, telling her it was no use.And it hadn't really affected her.Not until now.Her mother's face was pale."It's okay.We can just leave tomorrow.It's no big deal."They had been planning to leave the town for a little while now.Her mother wanted more opportunities for her, and she had gotten sick of staying in this place where everyone still subscribed to superstition.But, she supposed, they could wait for a day.Until the next day, the rule hadn't changed.She stared at the paint, dried, on the wall.For whatever reason, whoever--mortal or not--had been painting the command on the barn door hadn't been by, and she intended to find out why.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

"You don't believe in that nonsense, do you?""Um, I'm not sure."Cooper--her best friend since they'd been born--glanced around the store as he grabbed a banana from the basket and set it onto the shelf, refusing to meet her gaze.He walked to the next shelf, and Libby followed him."What do you mean?"She grabbed the apples from the cart and carefully stacked them onto the pile on the stand, then adjusted the crooked sign that read, 'Apples, $0.99.'"Look."He wiped his hands on his apron, then gently pressed on her wrist and looked at her, his green eyes unusually serious."Libby, you've gotta stop talking about this.It doesn't matter what you believe, you're going to get in trouble if you saying these things out loud.""But you know I'm right."Cooper sighed."Libby..."

Libby blinked her big brown eyes at him."But you'll at least come with me to Madame Sylvia's, right?"He was defenseless against that expression."Yeah," he finally grunted, running a hand through his short, sandy brown hair.Libby was always dragging him into adventures, and he was usually the one who got the short end of the stick.Like the time when they were thirteen and she wanted to go canoeing in Dragonfly Creek, and she ducked when they came to a low hanging branch, and it whipped him in the face and he had to get five stitches.Or the time when they were six and she had convinced him jumping into mud was fun, and she had landed on her feet, but he had slipped and fell.He hadn't been able to feel his bottom for a week after the whooping his mother gave him."Great, see you at my house when you're done here."She pecked him on the cheek, as she was wont to do, then sprinted out of the store.He touched a hand to the warmth for a second, his gaze following her, then got back to work setting out the groceries for the day.It was almost four when he opened the screen door and let himself in.Wolford had always been a safe town, so everyone kept their doors unlocked.It was difficult to commit crimes when the town population was only a couple hundred."Libby, I'm here!"he yelled, wiping his feet on the welcome mat before climbing up the stairs to her bedroom.When he reached the top, he was greeted by the view of dumping random things into her backpack.She lifted her head."Hi," she said, then went back to packing.Looking around at her room, at the knick knacks that had all disappeared into suitcases and duffel bags currently sitting in the corner of the room, he was hit by a pang of sorrow."Are you sure about leaving?"She raised her head, and he saw the conviction and stubbornness in her eyes."I'm sure.But not before this mess is resolved.Don't want to be dragged back and executed," she joked.Cooper forced himself to keep smiling, even as his eyes dimmed."Yeah.""Oh, come on, lighten up.It's not like we won't be able to see each other.We'll text every day, and then when I get rich, I'll bring you out to my mansion...it'll be great."She nudged his shoulder.It had always been easy for her to see through his facades, and this time was no different.He cleared his throat."So are we heading to Sylvia's?"She nodded, grabbing a bracelet from her dresser.She had made it herself; making jewelry pieces was her hobby, and one of the reasons she wanted to leave was that she wanted to one day visit Milan or New York City and actually go to school and become a designer.When they walked out her front door, she glanced over at her neighbor's place.Then she frowned.Ed's newspapers were really starting to pile up, and although he was usually gone for a couple days at a time hunting, he had never been gone for more than a week.But from the newspapers, it looked like it had been longer than that--maybe two weeks."He's still not back yet?"Cooper glanced over too.He never knew what Libby saw in the gruff hunter, but Libby insisted on being friends with the grumpy bearded man.To be honest, he found Ed a little frightening.He had only been in his house once, and the place had reminded him of a hunting cabin from head to toe, with furs and guns everywhere."I'm kind of worried," Libby said."But maybe he just found a really good hunting ground or something, I know he was talking about going a little further last time I spoke with him.""Oh."Cooper didn't really know how to respond to that.He knew the man only hunted out of necessity, but still...

Usually there were a couple people milling around Sylvia's yard, waiting for their turn to have her prophesy their future, but it was surprisingly empty when they reached it.Libby carefully opened the latch to the gate and walked in, then knocked on the door.It was several moments before the curtain in front of the small window on the door was pulled back, and Sylvia's bright blue eyes and brown, frizzy hair appeared in the window.After seeing who it was, she opened the door, but stood in the doorway."Um, can we come in?"Libby walked up and made to duck under her arm, but Sylvia took a step forward, until her small frame filled the doorway.Her lips were pressed into a thin line."What do you need?"Her accent had a strange twang to it.She wasn't born in Wolford like everyone else.She had arrived one day out of the blue and had simply settled down.But her past was a mystery to everyone in the town, and she was incredibly tight lipped about it whenever anyone asked, simply stating that she had lived in a big city.Libby held up the bracelet, which Sylvia surveyed before taking it and putting it in her pocket."I want to know what's wrong with the command.It's been the same for a couple days now, I'm sure you know by now."Sylvia stared at her for a second before her eyes shifted away."There is nothing wrong with the command," she stated tonelessly."It is as it should be.""But it's the same today as it was yesterday.It's never been the same before.""There is no rule against it being the same.The command will always give the town what it needs most," she stated vehemently.Then she eyed Libby up and down before adding, "And you would be wise to follow it.""I didn't-"

"I don't think you need to explain to me anything.I would just warn you to be careful.And remember to bring some crushed garlic with you."Before Libby could ask her what she meant, Sylvia had shut the door in her face.Libby stumbled backwards on the doorstep, nearly slipping, but Cooper caught her at the last second, his arms wrapping around her waist.She righted herself and turned to face him."She was acting really weird, wasn't she?It's not just me?""It's not just you."Cooper had been carefully examining Sylvia as she and Libby were talking, and the woman really was reluctant to talk to Libby.In fact, she seemed almost...scared.To him, it seemed like she was hiding something inside the house that she didn't want anyone to see.Which was strange because she had always welcomed people in before for all of her consultations.So what could've brought about this change?They walked back to Libby's house, each lost in their own thoughts and guesses about the strange events that had occurred.When they reached her front door, Libby turned to him, her face resolute."I'm going to leave and find out what happened, are you with me?"
##########
Someone mentioned that the explanation for the orbs last chapter was a bit lacking, so I went back and added in a bit of explanation.But for those of you who already read it, basically the leader's orbs allow them to make a deeper connection with the spirits they use, and that comes in the form of the symbol being branded more deeply onto the spirit's body.That's why they think the culprit is very likely Rina's mother because the brand on the pastor's forehead was so deep, which means only someone very powerful could have done it.Hopefully that explains it better!*****

He seemed like a different person altogether.Rina watched as Kael raised his hand, palm up, his gaze boring into the tiny bone in his hand.At the cathedral, he often laughed and joked around with his group of friends, and the pastors loved him because he was the star pupil.But over the past couple of days, although polite, he had worn a cool and collected mask in front of her, as if he were a robot.And she could safely say it was a facade because in certain moments, she noticed the way his jaw would tense, as if he wanted to say something.The bone in his hand burst into a blue flame, and small creature burst forth from the ashes of the bone.The bat flapped its wings several times before settling on his palm, its eyes an electric blue.On its forehead, there was the shallow imprint of the Napali clans symbolthree overlapping triangles with a star in the middle.Despite the fact that the bats skeleton was visible through its translucent skin, it was honestly kind of cute.Rina! 

She jumped up.Yes! 

The instructor frowned at her above the thin-rimmed glasses the rested on the tall bridge of his nose, and she awkwardly sat back down.She let out a small sigh.It wasnt that she didnt want to learn, it was that she honestly just had no idea what was wrong with her.She picked up the bone on her desk and held it up in her palm, feeling its texture.She let her eyelids flutter shut and her breathing slow.The magic felt like a cool stream running through her veins, and she allowed herself to feel its fullness before concentrating on pushing it toward her palm.Her mother often said that it should feel like a dam opening, that the difficult part was reigning it in so that you didnt accidentally use more than necessary.If you werent careful and used too muchwell.You might become as dead as the bodies you used.But that was never Rinas problem.Her problem was that what should have been a flood often felt like a dried up brook in summer with muddy, stagnant waters.It was there, but there was never enough.The surface of the bone began to char, and within moments, it flared into a flame.But just as she began to utter the incantation to call forth its spirit, it felt like she hit some sort of wall, and the magic simply stopped flowing and puttered out.It never failed to be jarring, and she gasped softly, feeling like the breath had been knocked out of her.Her eyes opened.When her gaze fell towards her palm, she sighed.In her hand was a complete model of a bat skeleton.Which was nice in theory, if you bought the fake stories.But though the bat was now here physicallywell, mostly physicallyits spirit was still missing.And it was why Bastion often joked about her spell-casting abilities.She stared down at the pile of bones ruefully.Maybe she should just go into paleontology.It would be easy enough to dig up some dinosaur bones, create the full skeleton, then sell them to museums and live off the savings for the rest of her life.Cute. 

Rina looked up.Kael had walked over to her desk, and maybe it was her imagination, but his eyes were full of mirth.He seemed familiar again, not the Kael shed seen these past few days.Erik left already, by the way.We can go now.  

She glanced around at the empty library.The instructor was nowhere to be seen.Then she dropped the pile of bones onto her desk and got up, following Kael out into the hallway.I wanted to ask you something. She rushed to catch up with his long strides.He slowed down slightly.Yeah? 

I thought you were a cleric?The first day, you mentioned you were a clerics son. 

I cant exactly come out and say Im a necromancer, can I? They casually strolled toward the gardens, and he seemed to relax.I know the clergy has a pretty long history of accepting necromancers, but othersones who just want to use magic for healingare less accepting of that kind of thing.You never wondered why the students sometimes looked at you weird? 

Rina cocked her head.Now that she thought about it, she did notice some of the students clamming up whenever she arrived, and conversations would randomly peter out.I guess my mothers just always telling me about how necromancy is such a powerful tool for doing good in the world, so I kind of forgot that it could be used for evil too. Her heart dropped.Like with Pastor Johns case.Yeah. His voice seemed to soften.Your mothers pretty great. 

Rinas eyebrows shot up.She stopped.You knew her? 

He gave her a sideways glance.Who doesnt? 

True.Being the most powerful necromancer ever did have its perks in terms of name-brand recognition.She hadnt had a chance to visit the back garden yet, so Kael took her around, explaining the historical origins for some of the statues and pointing out the more interesting histories for some of the flowers.She hadnt taken him for a history buff, but his eyes shone when he talked about how Aconite actually grew from the spittle of Kerberos when Herakles fetched him for one of the twelve labors.And how the poppy flower was created from Adoniss blood.When they looped back inside, they bumped into Viktor.Kael, Rina. He nodded at the both of them.How was the lecture? 

Fine. Kaels answer was terse.His gaze was fixed straight ahead, not meeting his fathers gaze.Ill ask Erik about your progress later. 

Kael simply nodded and walked past.Rina nodded at his father and ran to catch up with him.He had gone back to his room, but the door was slightly ajar.She knocked lightly.There was no response, so she pressed on the door gently, and it opened inward.Kael was standing in front of the window.She walked up to him and silently stood beside him.The room was completely silent for a couple moments, the only sound the faintest peep of birds chirping from the large tree outside the glass.Through the corner of her eye, she could see him glance at her, his mouth opening slightly, as if he wanted to say something.He faced back towards the window.Then he closed his eyes.You mustve noticed that I dont have a great relationship with my father. 

She didnt respond.What could she say to that, after all?Hes justhe cares so much about being the best.Likehe gestured to the crystal chandelier hanging above their headswhat does that matter?Yet he puts so much effort into curating his image.The perfect host. His voice was bitter.He treats guests so hospitably, yet when my mother was dying, he couldnt even 

He stopped himself.Then he took a deep breath.He turned toward at Rina, his shoulders stooped.He looked exhausted, yet he gave her a tired smile.Sorry, its not your problem.I just needed someone to vent to. 

Its perfectly fine.We all have our issues. She reached out a hand.Her fingers curled in hesitation, then she extended them out again and patted his back.Likemy mom is great, but theres just so much pressure, you know?I have to live up to these insane expectations, even if theyre not hers.And youve seen how I cant even enchant a small animal. She tried to lighten the mood.He shot her a grateful look and a small smile.Yeah, I get the pressure thing.

Then his gaze became distant, as if he were looking at a point beyond her.Anyways, thanks. 

She took that as her invitation to leave.When she reached the door though, she looked back.He was staring out the window again, and there was such an expression of longing on his face that she somehow just knew.He was thinking of his mother.*****

"Aiden Kaminsky.""Aiden Kaminsky," the voice said again, more annoyed.Aiden stared blankly ahead.Finally, the woman walked up and slapped him in the face, her eyes narrowed."Kaminsky," she said, venom dripping from her voice."You're free to go."He blinked, staring at her.Who was she?He could feel something distant stirring in his mind, a foggy memory, but it seemed out of reach.The woman simply glared at him and left, leaving him laying on the still-pulsating bed.In her book, 2000 years was nowhere enough punishment for a serial killer who targeted children.It was a wonder to her why they didn't keep the death sentence, but this man would've more than deserved it.It was the first time they'd given out such a long sentence though, to fit such an atrocious crime.And she was glad for it.The previous longest sentence had only been five hundred years."Wait, sorry."Aiden's voice floated out from the room, and the policewoman unwillingly doubled back.His voice had come out garbled, and she hadn't understood the words at first."What do you want?"she asked.He opened his mouth, his lips moving strangely, as if he were trying to formulate words that wouldn't come out quite correctly.The woman stared at him as he struggled.Was this because he hadn't spoken in 2000 years?Finally, he asked, "Who am I?"The woman blinked.This was the first time they'd gotten a prisoner who had been in so long he'd forgotten his own identity."I just remember...dreaming about walking through a raging desert," he said, then swallowed.His eyes glazed over, and if he weren't sitting up, she might have thought he was dead."For so long."The words came out as a whisper, and she had to lean towards him to make them out."For so long...like a dream."She sighed in exasperation and stood back.Maybe she was supposed to feel pity for him.But she couldn't bring herself to.He'd deserved it, even if his real life was now forfeit."Your name is Aiden Kaminsky," she said.No wonder he hadn't responded to his name."You were a serial killer before your punishment."A spark of memory.A sense of familiar hopelessness, resentment, and disbelief overwhelmed him.But it felt like a cloak, more comfortable than not.He'd been living with it for so long that when he woke up, he'd forgotten what it felt like to live without it.He felt bare."No, I wasn't," he said, shaking his head.He couldn't quite remember why not.Except for the conviction that he wasn't.There He had some sort of alibi...it was...

Brown eyes flickered into his memory.They looked down and away, guilty.Aiden blinked."I wasn't," he repeated again, not knowing what else to say.He'd forgotten a lot.The details were...so muddled.He could only see images and scraps of before.And that familiar resentment flooded in again.They say you cycle through the seven stages of grief during punishment.But it wasn't just one cycle.He remembered many cycles.So many cycles that they blended into one another and he could no longer tell which was which.Until the overarching emotion he finally felt became an all-consuming resentment and anger.He'd been fucked over his entire life by the system.As a child of immigrants, he'd had to watch as his mother worked as a janitor for Casper, the biggest tech corporation, but be paid pennies.His father took his own life when he was merely three after being falsely accused for stealing technology from a rival company, Sierra.And him...well.He had been smart.Graduated top of his university with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt.A life sentence.And then there had been med school.The numbers kept going up.And with the economy the way it was, he could only find work as a construction crew member.Maybe this reality wasn't even real.Maybe it was just another one of the endless cycles of dreams that he looped through.Death would have been better."You're a serial killer, and you were convicted in court.I can't *believe* you haven't repented.""Because there's nothing to repent."The words came out easier now, smoother.Aiden stared down at his hands.They were calloused ones.He flipped them over, looked at the palms where white bands of cracked skin ran down them.They were the hands of a worker.A worker who'd been falsely accused.A bitterness coated his throat, and a spark of something else.Something dangerous.He clenched his hands into a fist.After a while, he'd forgotten his name.He'd forgotten everything about himself, living in a cycle of senseless dreams.And for what?To come out and be known as a serial killer?But if there was one name he hadn't forgotten, one visage, it was the one responsible for him being here.Casper's own President.Owen Gray.*"Pin it on any of the workers."*

*He could still hear the words clear as day as he scrambled away from the door.A security guard had seen him and brought him back, and Aiden could still remember the sharp gleam in Owen's light blue eyes as he looked him up and down.*

*"He'll do," Owen said to the guard.*

The woman lost patience with him.She tugged at his arm and dragged him up."Look here, child killer," she snarled."Your cushy time here is over.Get out."At the contact, something broke inside of him.Maybe it was knowledge that he'd be known as a child killer for the rest of his life.Maybe it was that he'd wanted to die so many times in his dreams, yet was unable to.Maybe it was that he couldn't even remember the details of his life, who he was, whether he had a wife, what his job was.But he remembered a pair of eyes.And their gleam as the court used his education against him, saying he had the medical knowledge to kill those children swiftly and without being caught.Rage crashed over him like a tidal wave, and his eyes narrowed.Something snapped."Get off me," he snarled at the woman, throwing his arm out.Not expecting the sudden force, she was thrown back into the wall, her head banging into a protruding instrument, and she crumpled to the floor.He didn't bother checking if she still had a pulse.All the better if she didn't.The corner of his lips gradually tilted up.He was a serial killer, huh?Once again, he was enveloped by that familiar sense of resentment that had tucked him into bed every night and whispered sweet nothings in his ear.Telling him to fuck the world and watch it burn.It was now his closest companion and his best friend.Then he walked out of the facility.&nbsp;

If a serial killer was what they wanted, a serial killer was what they would get.

*****

Im just really lost about the entire affair.I have no idea where my mother wentshes probably off chasing whoever it isand I cant just stay with Kaels family forever. 

Theyre rich enough for you to though. 

Rina chucked a pebble at Bastion, and he swerved, the small rock missing his head by an inch.Rina picked up another pebble from the ground andwidening her stance like her father had taught her beforelet it sail in a smooth, flat arc toward the lakes surface.It skipped five times before disappearing with a tiny plop.Bastion tossed a rock in, and it landed with a kerplunk, the water rippling out around it.He found a larger rock nearby and sat down.He ruffled his brown hair that was just a little longer than he was used it.Everything will be fine.Theyre holding Pastor Johns wake right now, and his funerals tomorrow.Soat least hell find peace. Bastions gaze was serious for once.I justI get why Pastor Jeremiah didnt agree to have the Awakening Spell performed.But I just,Rina closed her eyesIm so conflicted.If we could do that, Pastor John could just tell us what happened.But I also dont want his spirit to be destroyed. 

It was a powerful spell.Spirits consisted of the persons identity: their personality and defining moments.But because memories often dont alter that identity, those memories are forgotten.Recollecting memories required bringing the person back in a capacity they were never meant to be brought back in.So in the process, all their bones would have to be destroyed, along with their spirit.Permanently.It was always a gamble.A desperate one that most peoples loved ones werent willing to take, even for retribution for a violent death.Rina sighed.She walked up to Bastion and laid a hand on his shoulder.Lets go visit Pastor John. She had only known him as a teacher for a month, but they ought to pay their respects nonetheless.When they arrived at the cathedral, it was almost dark out, the sun lazily lowering itself over the horizon.The cathedral had been illuminated with hundreds of candles lining the pews, and it lit up the darkness like a beacon.They were about to walk through the side door when Rina stopped, extending her arm out to prevent Bastion from pushing open the door.The door they were in front of had a small barred window with a direct view of the front of the church, where the casket for the pastor currently laid.In front of the casket was a person in a black cloak.They had their hood up, so she couldnt see who they were, but the furtive way they had looked around before walking up to the casket gave her pause.Suspicious.What?Whats happening? Bastion whispered.She shushed him, pointing toward the window.They didnt have to worry too much about being seen because the inside of the cathedral was so bright from candles that as long as they didnt have their faces pressed up against the glass, the darkness should hide them just fine.Rina had thought maybe the cloaked stranger would reach inside the casket, at which point she could basically be sure that they was doing something suspicious enough to warrant busting in, but they didnt.They simply stood there for a moment, their head bowed, as if uttering a prayer.She relaxed.Maybe it was just someone who had known Pastor John who wanted to say some personal words.It would make sense why they would look around then.The stranger then walked up to the row of candles behind the casket, where only a couple had been lit up.He rolled back the right sleeve of his cloak to pick up a lighted candle, and Rina froze, sucking in a breath.Beside her, Bastion too had become stock still, his eyes trained ahead.From the strangers palm up to halfway up his lower arm, where he had rolled the sleeve up to, his skin was a sickly white.The skin, covered in blisters and boils, looked like he had bleached it, then dunked it in scalding hot water.Rina clapped a hand over her mouth.She had seen this type of wound before.When she was just nine years old, a member of the clergy had gotten into a fight with a necromancer, and they had brought the necromancer to her mother.She hadnt understood why at the time because she didnt know how her mother could have possibly helped, but she had stood outside the door anyway, peeking into the crack as the man screamed.Her mother had gingerly removed his cloak, smoking and charred, to reveal the mans back.The skin had been pale as snow, the whiteness and blisters spreading out in a fractal pattern from the center of his back.She had screamed.Her mother had whipped around, her gaze cold, and slammed the door shut.Later, her mother had explained that that was white magic.The magic of the clergy.Almost always used to heal, it had instead in this instance been weaponized to maim.That was the first time she had learned that magic had no innate predilection toward good or evil.Her hands shot forward to push open the door.It was clear who had killed Pastor John.Pastor John wouldnt have died without a fight; the wound was the evidence.Now all she needed was their identity.But all of a sudden, she found her wrists clutched in an iron grip that was pulling her away from the door.Bastion held her hands in his own as he tugged her away, even as she tried to dive forward.No!What are you doing?Theyre *right there*! 

Bastions green eyes flashed.Are you stupid?If theyre strong enough to kill the pastor, you think they cant kill us?You cant even conjure up a bug to protect yourself, for christs sake!  

Rinas chest heaved as she glared at him.She ran back toward the door, but the stranger was gone.She pushed open the door, sprinting in, her gaze taking in the empty cathedral.With a frustrated growl, she stalked toward the main entrance of the cathedral, ignoring Bastions pleas to wait up.He laid a hand on her shoulder.She shrugged it off, whipping around.We couldve caught them, she said icily.We could have cleared my mothers name. 

They wouldve killed you.Then that wouldve just added a tally to the body count and we wouldnt be any closer to finding the killer, he shot back.At least I wouldnt be a coward. 

Bastions fists clenched.Fine.Dont thank me for saving your life. He brushed past her with long, heavy strides, and disappeared into the night.She stalked out too, but heading in the opposite direction, toward Kaels house.If he hadnt stopped her, she couldve resolved this entire mess.Now, instead they had a useless lead.She wasnt going to apologize.It was Bastions fault, and *he* was going to have apologize to her if he ever wanted her to forgive him.*****

"Why are you down here?"Maxis couldn't help but burst out.She stared at the man who simply stared at the ground, his eyes almost soulless.And she would know what that meant.She'd seen plenty of thousand yard stares...a thousand years ago."Um..." Richard blinked."Where am I?"Oh.That made more sense.The poor soul was simply lost."You're at the Gateway.Well, specifically, you're at the gateway to Hell, but you haven't made your choice yet."She pointed to the opposite side of the lake, mist rolling off of its surface."Just walk across there.You'll be at heaven in five minutes."Then she looked back down at her clipboard and began doodling again, filling the ten-thousandth page with sketches of a tall, regal nose and bright blue eyes.After a couple of moments of silence, she looked back up.The man hadn't moved.Her brows furrowed."What are you still doing here?"She'd already told him what to do.He should be waltzing off toward Heaven.Or had religion defined Hell as the new Heaven in the last ten minutes or so?She glanced at the completely empty line behind him.Nope."Do you want to go to Hell?"She raised an eyebrow.The question was sincere."Um, this is fine.I'm already here."She stared at him, speechless.Which, she hadn't been in quite a while, actually.A thousand years to be exact.This had to be the most ridiculous...

"Well, I'm not letting you in for a reason like that.So you can turn around and go across the lake."Didn't the man know what he was getting himself into?Richard finally looked at her then.Really looked at her, and Maxim was unnerved by the sudden hunger and desperation in his gaze."Clara?"he asked, his voice unsure."Who's Clara?"Maxis gave him a blank stare.Richard blinked, then averted his gaze.Then, hesitantly, he turned his gaze back towards her, his eyes hungrily taking in her image.He hesitated for a moment, then took a step closer."Who are you?"Maxis cocked her head.Gosh, she hadn't been asked that question in...five thousand years?Ten thousand years?Anyways, just a long, long time.So long she'd forgotten the answer to that question.So her answer was hesitant, unsure."I'm the gatekeeper," she said."No, I mean who were you before this?"Flashes of a child and a man's image appeared before her eyes, then red.Fire.Burnt timbers and ashes.She bit her lip."No one important."She pressed down on the pencil in her hand unwittingly, and the tip broke off, flying into the cloudy floor below.Great.Now she was going to have to travel all the way down the hall to sharpen it again."Can you get going now?"she asked him, unable to keep the annoyance from seeping into her voice."Were you human?"Richard asked again.He seemed almost desperate for an answer.So she took pity on this poor human who wasn't like the rest of the humans."Yes, okay?Twenty thousand years ago, I was.Then I decided to come to Hell, before this whole religion business was a thing, and I got assigned to Gatekeeper.So here I am."It was her story out in the open for the first time.The simplified version of it, anyhow."Can you come to Heaven with me?"Richard suddenly asked.He knew she wasn't Clara now, but she looked so similar, and...

Maxis stared at him.She rolled her eyes.Oh.So that's why he had stayed.Over the past couple of years, there had been men who had tried to lure her over to Heaven.They had been curious and come over to check out what Hell's gate looked like, and had been disappointed by the small wooden desk with the girl sitting by it.There wasn't even a gate in the true sense of the word."I can only come to Heaven if someone replaces my spot.Hell needs a keeper," she said.Then she rolled her eyes and crossed her hands over her chest, maintaining eye contact with him and leaning back in her seat.It was time for him to leave.Richard hesitated.Then he bit his lip and adjusted his polo shirt."Okay."Maxis reared back.What?"I was joking," she said to him."But you can go to Heaven if I replace you?""Well, yes, but--"

"Go."Maxis felt a glimmer of something in her chest.Something like hope.She hadn't seen him in so long--he'd picked Heaven--and she missed him so.She missed him so, so much."Are you...are you sure?"She no longer felt annoyance for the man standing in front of her, with his thick-framed glasses and polo shirt and loafers.She was curious as hell though."I'm sure."He drank her image in."But...can you take a message for me?To a girl named Clara Calhoun?Born in 1982, in North Dakota."As Maxis stood up, he moved to take her place behind the desk.He sat down in the chair.It wasn't so bad.The chair wasn't uncomfortable at all."Sure."She was forever indebted to him."Of course.Anything you'd like."Maxis felt a bit of remorse for not trying harder, for not warning him of what the job would entail, but this was probably her only chance to leave.Richard seemed to debate for a while about what he'd like to say.The image of Clara, telling him he ought to go to hell, popped up in front of his eyes.Her eyes had been full of vehemence, without their usual softness.Because he no longer deserved her kindness.He'd never seen her so full of hatred.And he was the rightful recipient.He closed his eyes."Just...tell her I'm sorry.Please."*****

Cora nearly jumped.She opened her eyes, and the world came back into view, with all of its holiday shoppers desperately squeezing around everyone else to try and get the last on-sale item, and with all the children running and screaming.Within a split second, she longed for the peaceful silence of her own mind."How did you see me?"she asked the boy standing in front of her.He looked around her age, twenty, with grey eyes and black hair.She had to admit his angular jawline was especially handsome.He stared at her strangely."Well, you were just standing there in the middle of the aisle with your eyes closed.What do you mean?"That shouldn't be possible though.She was invisible, just as she'd always been.It was her childhood that had given her the special ability.When she had turned ten, her parents had split and each created their own homes, making her the forgotten child of a two separate families.She was ping-ponged between the two, not as a child who was wanted, but as someone who was chased away whenever the parent felt like it was the other's turn to fulfill their financial obligation.And so she'd gradually forgotten what the word "home" meant.That was when it began.She discovered early on that if she stood out in public and closed her eyes, she could vanish before the world, create her own little cabin by the beach, where she could lounge around all day without anyone intruding.For an introvert like herself, it was perfect.It was likely just a fluke.She closed her eyes again, drawing up the image of the beach in her mind's eye, imagining herself walking along the sand, barefoot.Someone tapped her on her shoulder."How did I suddenly get here?"the boy asked.Cora startled, her eyes popping open as the image vanished.The boy had a look of shock and confusion on his face as he stared at her."How was I...suddenly on a beach?"She didn't have an answer to that one.So without much hesitation at all, she ran."Wait, I'm Luke!What's your name?"he shouted at her, his voice almost lost in the fervor of the mall crowd.*Luke.* 

*** 

He appeared in her visions almost every time after that.And strangely...he accepted it.He followed her around at first, asking her all sorts of questions, and after a couple of times, she finally caved and told him about her ability to try to scare him away.But instead, he simply nodded and followed her around more.And Cora had to admit...she liked it.He had this way of looking completely focused when he was listening to her ramble on, his grey eyes intense and his black hair blown back by the sea wind.She felt wanted.Needed.Eventually, he became her best friend, and she began to look forward to his visits.It got to the point where if she closed her eyes and he wasn't there, she would feel disappointed.He said he liked the wilderness, so she created mountains for him.She expanded her tiny world from the beach into a vast canvas of lakes and rivers and oceans--limited only by her imagination--and they went hiking almost every day.And then two months after all this, he asked her to meet up.But in real life this time.So with a bit of hesitation, she agreed.Despite their comfort with each other in the dream world, their first date was an awkward affair.Full of accidental hand touches as they both reached for popcorn in the movie theater and a hesitant good night kiss on her forehead as he took her home.***

She discovered that she had a harder time maintaining her visions.She would be in her dream state, and then she would suddenly think of him, and the vision would vanish, rendering her visible again.And maybe five months ago, she would've been worried.Anxious.But it felt less important now to have somewhere to go.Because...she probably never truly wanted to be alone.It was just that being lonely in a crowd was infinitely worse than being lonely by yourself.Luke was...a dream come true.She never imagined that someone would be able to know her well enough to understand that when she kicked off her shoes at the doorway instead of carefully sliding her feet out, she was in a bad mood.Or to understand that whenever she was daydreaming, he could wake her up with a kiss.A year and a half later, he popped the question.They got married along a coastline almost exactly like the one in her dreams.And after that moment, her skill just...vanished.Without much sense of loss or fanfare.

"This is where you'll be staying."The angel gestured toward the large house.Lucy had expected a mansion, but it was...plain, almost.Like how you might expect a classic house in suburbia with a picket fence to look.You might look at the two and say: look, they're sister houses.The house for pride, just next door, was exquisite.With large pillars and vaulted ceilings, it resembled a cathedral.Apparently residents of Envy and Pride resided together, which made sense.They were two sides of the same coin.She didn't feel jealous, just a sense of acknowledgement.A good thing; if she had, maybe she should have gone to that house instead.The angel led her toward her house, past the garden filled with petunias and amaranth and lilies.The cobblestone path was clean; no dirt marred the stones that looked like they'd just been plucked out from the water, their surfaces smoothed by thousands of years of silken watery caresses.The door of the house opened, and a small form shot out, bolting straight at her.Her eyes widened when she noticed the small patch of white fur on its forehead.She bent down as the golden retriever began licking her face, its tail wagging furiously as it nuzzled its wet nose into her neck.She could feel tears pricking the back of her eyes."Daisy!It's Daisy, right?"She looked up at the angel, her eyes desperate and wild, as she hugged the dog to her as closely as she could.Daisy had been her best friend when she was a child.They were inseparable.Lucy would always sneak her snacks when her parents weren't looking, and in return, Daisy would stand watch at the end of her bed every night, making sure the monsters never got to her.When she was fifteen, Daisy had passed away from kidney failure.That year had been the worst of Lucy's life, and she remembered gorging herself on chocolates until she puked into the toilet, the taste of acid and bile coming up her throat.It hadn't made her feel any better.That was when it all began."Here, let me show you to your room."The angel led her in the door and they walked down the long hallway with wooden floors and pastel blue walls, Daisy trailing at their heels.Lucy laughed.It resembled a cozy bed and breakfast.The angel stopped in front of room 342 and pressed her palm to the door.Then she gestured toward Lucy to do the same.Lucy gingerly placed her palm on the door, and it began to pulse.Then, it slowly vanished.The room within was the same setup she had at her apartment.A large, fuzzy pink rug covered the floor, and a queen size bed took up most of the space in the room.A white, wooden dresser stood next to the bed, covered with her favorite toiletries.The only difference was the mirror opposite the bed.Lucy made a point to avoid staring in it as she walked in and sat down on the edge of the bed.It was soft, exactly as she remembered.The angel smiled, then backed out of the room.Over the next couple of weeks, Lucy simply explored her surroundings, making friends with a couple people on her floor as well as a muscled man from Sloth, and a girl who was now actively in therapy to fix her kleptomaniac tendencies from Greed.The girl hadn't stolen anything since arriving, so Lucy had to say she was doing well.But if there was one thing that nagged at her, it was that her own house was so exceedingly normal.She could see the tendencies still, in the other houses.In Lust, Wrath, Sloth.But in her own, all her friends just seemed so...well-adjusted.She didn't quite know what to make of it.One day, as she was standing by the lake behind their house, pondering the question, a man came to stand next to her.She didn't know how she knew, but she was sure this was God.She felt no awe at his presence, no fear, just a sense of peace."You have a question for me."He smiled, and the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes creased."Yeah.I was wondering about my house.I chose Gluttony, and I thought there would be food everywhere, but there's nothing.We go to the cafeteria like everyone else for food, there's just one plate of cookies sitting on the desk outside in the hall, not three, and nobody's stockpiling snacks."God was silent for a moment.He picked a smooth stone and skipped it across the lake.It bounced four times before sinking below the surface with a small plop."You don't need it."Lucy's head cocked to the side in confusion."I don't understand."God picked up a stone, then turned and passed it over to her.She held it in her hands, feeling its warmth.The sun had soaked into it, making it a mini hand-warmer."You chose gluttony because you believed it was a part of who you are.But it's not.It's a consequence of trying to fit into a world that you felt distanced from."His voice was low, calm."A sense of alienation that drove you to find comfort in the one thing you found tangible and unchangeable.And for the others, it's the same.I allowed you to choose your houses, but it's to let you realize that your identities are not defined by your sins, but by your beliefs."He skipped another rock.One, two, three, four."Lucy, none of you sinned.Just like you can't blame friendships for breaking apart just because, in the end, you're different people, how could I blame any of you for lashing out in disappointment when the world didn't turn out how you wished?Perhaps, only someone who has lived in that world could understand.All the hardest, coldest people you meet were once as soft as water.And that's the tragedy of living."***** 

The last line above is actually a quote by Iain Thomas.One of my absolute favorites, and one of the saddest I have ever heard.

"Come now, Nikolas."I wheeled the old man down the hall, stopping for just a second to adjust the blanket in his lap.I'd been watching over him for nigh on twenty years now, since I was just a young woman myself, till now.He'd been there for the better part of my life now.And in the last twenty or so years, the crinkles of his eyes never got deeper, and his smile became colder.In the least strange way possible, it always seemed like it was meant to be this way.I had never gotten to travel.Born into a world that didn't care whether I lived or perished, I barely survived orphanage, almost falling victim to a carer who only wished to bleed the institution dry and gave no fucks about us, and then to a foster parent who had one too many kids.I can still recall the way Cindy used to sneer at me from the couch, her rotund body spilling off the sides, barking at me to make another sandwich.You're only around so we can get tax breaks, she used to say to me.You should be grateful.Gratitude is a word I did not understand until the age of twenty, when after eking my way through college, I became saddled with a mountain of debt.College will help you land a job, the professors had said.It will change your future, make it bright and wondrous.Even back then, I had wondered, could college help make me feel less alone?All throughout my life, the one thing that had followed me was an aching sense of loneliness, no matter how many friends I made at the orphanage or how many parties I went to in college.Peoples' faces all seemed to blur together, and no one stayed around for longer than a year.But at end of four years, I graduated with a degree and a sense that I was no less alone than I had been four years ago.And even worse, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't seem to get a job.So maybe it was through sheer dumb luck that I saw the "Help Wanted" flyer for the nursery on the board, the last strip of phone number barely hanging on by a thread.Maybe it was dumb luck that Nikolas had wheeled himself into the interview room, demanding an ice cream cone, and that I had--by some whim--decided to go out and grab it, the interview be damned.Perhaps it was the way he said it--a deep resignation embedded within the angry tone he had used.I knew it well.I had used that tone often enough to lash out against my roommate, the one person who had had any chance of being my friend.It was the tone someone used when they wanted to be loved but had no idea how.I resolved, at that moment, to help him in the way I couldn't be helped.To save him in the way I could not be saved.The job was stable enough.There weren't many benefits, but anything was a step up from the streets.I got my own little room, a twin sized bed, and a bookshelf that could fit three books along the bottom shelf and nothing else because the other shelves fell if any weight was put on them.The residents usually only rang during the night if they needed to use the restroom, but some of the more persnickety ones called me up sometimes to turn on the TV and then five minutes later to turn it off.Nikolas rang whenever he felt like it.And since he didn't keep a steady sleep schedule, neither did I.

I think it was more about the human contact than anything else.Every time I showed up to his room, his eyebrows would furrow together like he abhorred me being there, but then he would find all sorts of excuses to keep me there anyways.His flowers needed tending to.The vase needed to be moved.His pillows were uncomfortable.The sun was too bright, and he wanted the blinds shut.The room was too dark, and he wanted the blinds open.Perhaps I should've been annoyed.The other nurses were, after all, and eventually, since I became the only one who could handle his strange temperament, I was the sole nurse assigned to him.But strangely enough, I didn't mind.I relished the endless stories that could've been nothing but some combination of fiction and memories from the history books he loved to devour.In this way at least, I could travel.Nikolas's mind is just as sharp as it was twenty years ago.He hasn't seemed to age one bit.I am older now, and I can feel my limbs begin to ache when I settle into my twin bed at night.But I still feel twenty.I still feel that sense of wonder every time Nikolas comes up with a new tale.I know he's old.Much older than he has any right to be, and that he won't be around forever.But somehow, I feel like he won't die before me.I get the feeling that he's waiting for me.That in the end, it wasn't me saving him.It was him saving me.

She felt like her skull was splitting open.Rina groaned.What had happened to her?She brought her fingers to her temple and gingerly massaged it.Then, it all came back to her in a tidal wave of memories.The bats.Viktor.And the dog.She shot up, glancing wildly around the room.Fresh daffodils along the windowsill, a bookshelf full of comic books, and a sleek desktop on a table.This wasBastions room?The door opened, and Kael walked in.He paused upon seeing her.Youre awake? 

Yeahwait.What happened?Why am I here?And for that matter, why are you here? 

Well be here until the situation with my father gets resolved. He walked over to the bed and quickly explained how his father had somehow gotten ahold of her mothers orb, which was how he had engraved the body with their family symbol instead.He glanced at her, then reached out a hand.She flinched, startled.He simply gave her a look, and then reached forward again.She held her breath as his fingers pulled back the collar of her blousewho had fitted her in it anyway?to reveal her collarbone.His cool fingertips gently grazed over the skin.She couldnt help but stare at his profile as he leaned in, at the sharp chiseled planes of his face and his long, soft lashes.He drew away, then sat down at the edge of the bed.Theres bruising, but you should be fine in a couple days. 

Oh 

She blinked.Wait, you knew about your father? 

Kael looked away.Just figured it out day before yesterday.I figured something was wrong, but I couldnt confirm it until then.And then yesterday was spent getting grilled by the council. 

She couldnt help but notice his fingers twitch when he said it.Knowing that your father was a murdererno matter how bad their family relations were, that wasnt an easy thing to learn.She reached out and put her hand over his.Im sorryabout your father. 

His expression seemed to soften, and a small hint of a smile graced his lips.Thanks.Dont go getting all soft on me though.What happened to the loud, rambunctious girl who once threw her potted plant through the cathedral windows and nearly gave Pastor Jeremiah an aneurysm? 

I did not! 

He tilted his head back and laughed, a deep-bellied laugh seemed to reverberate throughout the room.Youre just a trouble-maker. 

She glared at him.And youre a goody-goody two-shoes. 

Well, Im glad we have our identities figured out at least. 

The room fell into a comfortable silence, and with the bright sunshine spilling through the window and the sound of birds chirping outside, Rina could almost believe that all of the events of the past week or so had never happened at all.Kael stood up.I have to go back home really quickly to figure out next steps, but Ill see you around? 

She nodded.Suddenly, a feeling like she had to do *something* overwhelmed her.Wait! she said, and clambered off the bed.Kael, who was standing with his hand on the doorknob, turned.Before she could regret her decisionor think about how weird she must look in Bastions mothers nightwearshe leaned up on her toes and pecked him on the cheek.Thankyouforsavingme. 

Then, she shoved him out the door and slammed it shut behind him, leaning with her back against it.Her heartbeat raced in her ears, even as she heard the soft chuckle from through the door and footsteps walking away.Had she really just done that?She took a deep breath, then exhaled.Wait.If the situation with Viktor had been resolved, then that meant she could go home.Immediately, she opened the door and dashed out.After almost ten minutes of non-stop running, she finally reached the front gate to their little picket-fence house.Maybe, just maybe, by some miracle, her mother would be back now that the crisis was over.Maybe she had just been lying in wait to see what happened.Rina stood in front of the front door, her hand inches away from the doorknob, but she couldnt bring herself to open the door.What if her mother wasnt home?How would she even know where to find her?As she stood there, contemplating, the door opened.And Rina was faced with a woman with long, curly red hair, round glasses, and a frown on her face.Rina, where have you been? 

Rinas eyes widened, and she flew forward into the womans arms.Mom! 

Young lady, where were you last night?I came back and expected to see my lovely daughter at home waiting for me, and instead I come home to an empty house.All night! 

Where did you even go?I thought, with all the stuff that happened with Viktor and everything that maybe you had gone to hide out 

Her mom pulled back out of the hug.What stuff with Viktor?Whats going on? 

Rina blinked.You dont know? 

Know what? Her mothers brows furrowed.Then where were you? 

Her mother did something Rina would have never expected.She blushed, then giggled like a little girl.Oh, you know how it is.I havent seen your father in so long, so I went up to Ashborne to visit him for a couple days.You didnt see the note I left you?I stocked the fridge for the whole week with your favorite foods. 

Rina wanted to smack herself.She had never even thought to come home after the incident.She had just been taken straight to Kaels house.All her worrying had been for nothing.But alsoher mother was talking to her father again?Since when?She shivered just thinking of her mothers giggle.Now tell me everything.  

So Rina told her about everything that had happened the past couple of days, making sure she didnt leave out a single detail.After she was through, she sighed in exasperation.How did he even take your orb? 

Her mother simply blinked innocently.Oh, I havent seen that thing since the last council meeting.I guess I just left it there? 

Rina felt like spitting blood.How was it possible that her mother was the most powerful necromancer alive?Soabout this Kael.I taught him a couple tricks whenever I was over at the meetings.Hes nice. She looked at Rina expectantly.Umyes? 

Youre eventually going to introduce him to me formally as your boyfriend, right?Oh, its so romantic. She swooned.He saved your life!Its the perfect tale to tell the grandkids. 

Rina blushed.She couldnt admit that when her mother had said that, she had imagined what it would be like to have a future with Kael.Of course, it would still have nothing on your fathers and my love story.Just think, its a cold day out on the river, and Im stranded in a canoe.And your father just swoops in 

Mooommmm!

"You like that, huh?"Cora scrolled down the poster's history.She didn't know how they had gotten ahold of the details of her cases, but they were all there in black and white.Nomad363.She simply couldn't have them exposing her.It wasn't easy to track him down.She had called on her organization's private detective, even got back in contact with some of her old contacts--one of who had thrown a dagger at her head the second she had walked in the door--but no one knew where he was.Or who he was.IP tracking didn't work.And if that wasn't the strangest thing, it was that the government had no files on the man.He had his own subreddit, so his name wasn't difficult to trace.And he had even put up a picture of his face.Such an open and close case, and yet she had been struggling to find him for two weeks at this point, with no sign of even narrowing down the search.Thomas Gordon.The impossible man.Maybe, she would've stopped looking.She had never encountered such an impossible case before, and there was nothing for her to do.Except, one day when she was simply walking down the street, she just saw him.Right there.Walking out from the grocery store with a large bag of groceries in his hand.She tailed him back to his house, then picked the lock.After it turned dark, she gingerly stepped inside.The house was quite normal looking, with a Persian rug in the entranceway and wooden floors.A dining room to the side of the entryway had a display cabinet with china displayed in it.The lights had been turned off, all except a soft glow coming from the room towards the back of the house.As she crept her way toward the room, gun held at the ready, she noticed the papers scattered around.Balled up wads of lined paper and printer paper, just scattered around.She picked one up off the desk and her eyes widened.It was a sketch of her face.The likeness was impeccable, down to the tiny mole on the left side of her chin and the small, raised ridge of a scar on the right side of her forehead.So this man clearly knew more about her than she thought.Who was giving him this information though?There was no indication that he was anything besides ordinary.She shook her head.It didn't really matter.She would simply have to pull that information from him.Cora slowly turned the knob to the door, her body pressed flat against its surface, and let it swing open.Inside, a man sat with his back to her, typing away on his laptop.With silent steps, she walked up to him, pressing the gun to the back of his head.Then she cocked it.He froze."Who is this?"his voice quavered.He slowly spun around in his chair, his hands now held up in the air, and turned to face her.His eyes widened."I'm Cora.The one you've been writing prompts about.Have you been having fun?""Wha-what?But- "

"How did you get all the information on me?Who gave it to you?"she snarled, pressing the gun harder against his temple."I..."--he looked more shocked and dazed than anything--"I don't...how is this possible?"Cora's brows furrowed.There was something strange about this man's reaction.He should've been pleading for his life.Or confident.Not sitting there in a plaid shirt, a half dazed look on his face as if he didn't know what was going on."This isn't possible," he repeated, as if to himself."You're just some character I created.You shouldn't exist.This isn't even--" His gaze swung around wildly, and it was then that Cora noticed the walls.For the first time in her life since she had started down this path of no return, she felt shivers run down her spine.All along the walls were posters of her.Each one's backdrop detailing a case that no one in the world knew about besides her.In one poster, the man pleading for his life, wearing a silly blue tie with a whale on it.On another, a woman laying in bed, a mirror on the dresser besides the bed.All details that couldn't have been known except for the person who was there.Except for her, and the dead ones.And everyone knew the dead tell no tales."How?"The words came out of her mouth unbidden.She couldn't feel her fingers, like someone had dunked them in an ice bath for hours.Then she turned toward his monitor.Toward the cursor that was still blinking on the interface that could only be Reddit.Hesitantly, she walked towards it, dreading what it would say.Maybe she knew already, even in that moment.But when her eyes scanned the words, she could still feel her heart pounding loudly in her chest, unable to hear anything besides the blood rushing past her ears.**[WP] You are the worlds most elite assassin.Although you usually only kill when paid, you finally decide to take matters into your own hands...|**

"How's your day?"The same words that Luke had said for the last two years came rushing out of his mouth.His fingers played with the clean fork in front of him, tapping a single prong gently against the wooden surface of the table."Good, and you?"Andrea gave him a warm smile, her brown eyes twinkling as she laid down a menu in front of him.There was a dimple in the corner of her cheek that he loved so much, but he could never bring himself to compliment it.Andrea cleared her throat, blushing from his intense gaze, and brushed a stray strand of hair behind her ear."I'm good," he said.Then he fell silent.Andrea cleared her throat."So two eggs, bacon, and toast?Same as always?"She gave him a shy smile.There was that dimple in her cheek again.He nodded.She took the menu back, pausing for half a second before she turned around and headed back towards the kitchen, her ponytail swaying with every step.Luke's gaze followed her until she vanished through the double doors of the kitchen.Then he sighed, his eyes dimming.Andrea was...perfect.She was kind to every she met, even beggars on the streets, and he'd never seen her without a smile on her face.Oh, how he loved her smile.Tilted to one side, her nose wrinkling slightly whenever she found something particularly amusing.But in the three years he'd known her, he hadn't been able to deviate from his script even once.Limited to the only options he had to communicate with people.Despite all the super-hero abilities he did have, he considered it a curse more than a blessing.Andrea came back with his food almost immediately, her cheeks flushed.There would've been no time to prepare the food in the minute she was gone.So he knew she must've had it prepared, sitting there, waiting for him, as always.Because he always came to the diner at 8:30am precisely, just to eat quickly so he could catch her at the end of her shift.When the bill came, she paused beside the table, waiting for him to sign.Luke scribbled his name, then handed her the receipt.But she still stood there, her chocolate brown eyes focused on his, her lips pressed together.He could do it this time.He had to be able to.Luke's gaze met hers."Andrea," *will you go out with me?*

He could almost taste the words falling off his tongue, hear them spilling.Could imagine the way they'd roll off like the lyrics to a song he'd sung way too often.But the way her gaze was still lit up in anticipation told him that he hadn't said the words.Would never be able to."...have a good day," he said.The same thing he'd said for the last three years.Andrea still gave him a smile, but he didn't miss the way her eyes dimmed.She blinked quickly a few times."Yeah, have a good day."Then she turned around and headed back into the kitchen.And for the thousandth time, Luke stood up and walked out of the diner, only the taste of bitterness in his mouth.

The bitter stench of Lana's death still coats my throat.I could still see her smile, the dimple in her cheek every time I said something funny, the tiniest quirk upwards of her lips whenever she was trying not to laugh.Gosh, I wish we could just help those people, she said once, her eyes glued to the television.I was cooking eggs at the time, and I plated them before turning to see what she was talking about.On the screen, the protestors raised their signs and asked for justice for their loved ones.And the president said that the shooting wasn't on his orders.That the person who had been responsible had been fired.Two lies in quick succession.At that time, she hadn't known about my ability.My mother had told me that having power was a dangerous thing, and to never tell anyone about my own.People will use you, she said.They will run you under a microscope and lock you up like a lab rat.That message has stayed with me ever since.I never figured out how I knew people were lying.But, five years into our relationship, I finally told Lana my biggest secret.Instead of running away screaming, she thought it was the most amusing thing.She would say all sorts of tiny lies, like what shade of lipstick she was wearing that day--pink when it was really lilac--and force me to guess if she was lying.And every time after, she would laugh, her voice like the clear tinkle of wind chimes.And she would ask me when I planned on using my ability for good.To help the world in a way that no one else could.I always put it off.Later, I would tell her, then kiss her on the forehead as if I was placating a child.And I was placating her, because I had no intention of using it to do anything.My dream was to live a simple life with her, have some children of our own, and to live peacefully.That was all.And it should have been all.Except I can still hear the ringing of the telephone that day that felt so ominous.I had looked at the unknown number for a while before deciding to pick up.Hello?Hi, Mr. Lancaster.Lana Smith listed you as her emergency contact, and we're calling you because she's currently in the hospital...I couldn't hear the rest over the buzzing in my head, the pen in my hand blurring as I wrote down the hospital's address.I couldn't even remember when I had gotten the pen and paper.The hospital.I needed to get to the hospital.The drive was short, almost shorter than I'd believed possible, just ten minutes from my apartment running through red lights to get there, but it was already too late.A man--a boy--was sitting there, his face in his hands.He walked up to me when he saw me, his face contorted into an expression of regret."I didn't mean to hit her.I'm sorry, dude," he said.He had sandy blonde hair and neon shorts.He looked just twenty.A frat boy.Two lies.I wanted to hit him, to smack him then and there, but I held it in.I didn't have the effort to even consider why he had lied.To consider why he might have wanted to kill her on purpose.Maybe he was a scorned lover, maybe her attendance at the protests had pissed off his father.I didn't know, and I didn't care.I wanted him dead.He went to court.His rich politician daddy got him off easy, and I watched in the back of the booth as he cried snake tears for a jury that took it all in like rats snorting sugar.For the first time in my life, I felt an anger unlike anything I'd ever felt before.I saw red.I was going to kill that man.It was several moments later before I came to my senses, face pressed against the floor with the security officer's knee in my back.Apparently I had tried to attack the boy.I didn't remember it.They let me go because "they understood."And for the next ten years, I made it my life's mission to become the judge for all cases.So no one would ever have to go through what I went through again.I took down corrupt politicians.I solved murder cases at the drop of a hat.I was praised and glorified by the world.For ten years, it was just me in that courtroom, and a scribe to take down the decisions.No jury needed.Each case solved in half an hour or less.And yet I felt empty inside.Like something had gnawed away my heart, and all that was left was an empty shell.But maybe God felt sorry for me, because ten years later, I am left staring at the boy who has turned into a man.The sandy blonde hair still remains.And the neon shorts still remain.He sits in front of me today accused for being involved in a drug ring.He only bought drugs, he says.He has no idea that he was involved and that he was a drug mule, despite carting over a thousand pounds of cocaine over the course of several years.There's a glint in his eye as he tells the story, and I know what it is.Because he's telling the truth.So he knows he'll get off.The punishment would be huge--fifty years in jail--but he won't receive it.And so he smiles as he tells his story.The bitter taste on my tongue grows stronger, and I remember Lana's pale face as she lies on the hospital bed, lifeless.I remember the way her mother falls to my feet, unable to breathe for her choking sobs.I remember her smile, begging me to use my ability to do good in the world.For her, she pleaded, her eyes wide and hands clasped together.Her bottom lip jutting forward into a pout.He's guilty, I tell the scribe, expressionless.He's my last case for the day, so I shrug off the black robes and set them down.And then I walk out of that courtroom and resign.For ten years, I had vowed to myself, for Lana, to tell the truth in return for the people who brought me their truths.I had vowed to use this power for nothing but good.Today, I broke that vow.For her, and because of her.And I hope, wherever she is, that she'll forgive me for that.

*Please don't forget me.* 

Whenever Kane woke up, it was always that voice, so soft and sweet, whispering those words in his ear.But when he would try to recall a face, he never could.Just warm, chocolate eyes.You get sick of living when you're immortal.You get sick of the endless days and even more endless nights, and you start thinking, how can I die?But dying wasn't so easy.He knew.He had tried quite a few times.But it wasn't because he was indestructible, because he wasn't.But it was because whenever he thought he'd succeeded, he would be brought back.Somehow, like a miracle.One time, he had tried to drive his car into a lake.As it filled up with water, he remembered just the blue surrounding him, until he stopped struggling.Until he was surely about to die.But the next day, he woke up washed up on the shore, the EMS truck lights flashing blue and red against his closed eyelids.Girl dies in vehicle driven into lake, boyfriend survives, headlines wrote.The doctors would ask him about the girl.What girl?he would reply.Another time, he tried to burn the house down.As he lay in his bed, enveloped by the fumes and smoke, he laughed.Hopefully, he would be reborn in the flames.As a mortal.As someone who had a timestamp for birth, and one for death.He would wake up the next morning to headlines of a girl who died in a fire.Did you know her?Ava?the police would ask.No, he would reply.I don't recognize that name.But he tucked it away anyway, deep into the recesses of his memory.Why did it sound familiar?It was one day, many years later, when the mystery would be revealed by a girl standing at his door, her hands wringing as she waited for him."Who are you?"He didn't know why, but he was disappointed when he saw her golden hair and eyes."You're Kane, right?Can we talk?"She let herself into his house, and he followed.He had long ago accepted the strange things that happened."My name is Mia."She sat down on the couch."I-I'm not supposed to be here.But I had to, for my friend.""Who's your friend?"Somehow, he knew the answer before she said it."Ava.""Who's Ava?That name...sounds familiar."Mia's face looked pained."Because it is."She brought out a picture of a girl with brown, wavy hair and dark, chocolate eyes.*Please don't forget me.* 

"Who is she?"he asked again, his fingers caressing her face in the photograph.He knew her, somehow or somewhere."She's a time traveler.As am I.We're part of an organization called the Erue.It's our job"--she gulped, then closed her eyes as if it pained her to say what came out next--"to save immortals."Her eyes shifted nervously.It was clear the information she had just given out was confidential.He waited for her to continue, pulling out a mug and filling it with tea.The steam swirled upwards in soft curls as he placed it in her hands."You were Ava's assignment.And she was just supposed to help out.Just save you, but I think she realized early on that she couldn't.That you were desperate to die, and it's never a time traveler's obligation to trade lives, but she loved you, and..." she took a deep breath and looked into his eyes."...she died for you so many times."He felt something twinge in his heart.Something that resembled an emotion, which he hadn't felt in a long time.Perhaps heartbreak."Why are you here?"he asked."Because she's dying.When we're anointed as time travelers, we get a certain number of timelines in the multiverse where we're supposed to watch over our wards.She's spent every last one saving you.Dying for you."Her eyes were resolute."I want you to come with me and go to before she became a time traveller.I want you to convince her to never become one."He was silent for a moment."Okay," he finally said.He felt something tugging him to meet her.Who knew what it was?But if he met her, maybe he would know."Okay," Mia said, and sighed in relief.She grasped his arm, and they blinked out of the timeline.*****

Next part should be up later tonight!EDIT: Sorry!!Last minute plans cropped up (you wouldn't even believe all the crazy things that have happened), but I won't be able to update tonight!Hopefully I should get to it tomorrow, but it's looking pretty rough...

She was going to have to apologize.Rina rolled over in her bed and groaned.Bastion was always trying to temper her brashness, and she was always lashing out at him for it, then regretting it.He was right.She shouldve waited.What he said was true, after all.She *wasnt* capable of taking him down.She just wanted tostop feeling useless.Over the past couple of days, there had been nothing for her to do except sit around and wait for someone to figure out what hadnt.Except there hadnt even been a peep of news, and her mother was still missing.With a sigh, she got out of bed.Time to resign herself to heading over to Bastions house and enduring his mockery for two hours before he would eventually forgive her and the cycle would start all over again.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Rina, can I talk to you? 

Viktor gave her a warm smile.She hesitated for a moment, glancing down the hallway at the front door that was just a couple feet away, before nodding and following him towards the library.So how are you adjusting? 

He sat down behind the mahogany desk.On the corner of the desk closest to her sat the large, jade bowl that held the bat bones from their last lesson, a small ink bottle with a grey feathered quill that looked like it mightve come from a hawk, and a clay bowl full of the ashes of smoking incense.The quite-normal looking marbles seemed oddly out of place in the library, full of its unusual knick-knacks.His grey eyes fixed on her as she sat down in the leather chair in front.Im doing fine, she said.Thank you for your hospitality, she added, rushed.Of course. He cleared his throat.Have you talked to your mother?Do you know where she is? He leaned forward.Maybe it was her imagination, but he seemed a little too eager to hear her answer.She shifted uncomfortably, hesitating.I havent, and I dont know, she finally said.Beneath his black cloak, she could see his shoulders visibly relax as he sat back, the crease lines in his forehead disappearing.Oh, thats unfortunate, he said.But his face was impassive, almost expressionless.She stared, feeling a prickle of unease run down her spine.Yes, it is, she said slowly.He cares so much about being the best.Her mind raced.Her gaze drifted to his cloak and down his sleeve.Would Viktor really do something like that?Her heart pounded in her chest.Would his ambition really lead him to treat her like fodder?Her gaze drifted toward the bookshelf behind him.Only one way to find out.She slapped on a bright smile.I was reading the other day, and I learned something cool though!You wanna know what it is? Her gaze scanned the books behind his head.The bookshelf that basically sat right behind him.Viktor blinked.Sure. 

She got up out of her chair, her fingertips almost unwilling to unclench from the leather of the armchairs.They felt numb, with prickles of feeling like slight pins and needles piercing the skin running down, as if she had sat on them for a long time and blood was rushing back into them.She made her way toward him, her steps as even as possible.Excuse me, she said as she, too, was now behind the desk, a mere inches away from the man who she now suspected might be the worst type of murderer.Could she even feel her lips anymore?They, too, felt slightly numb.She looked up, at a dusty tome on a high shelf.On its spine, printed in golden lettering, was a language that she didnt recognize.It was also the heaviest looking book on the shelf.She leaned up on her tiptoes, stretching her fingertips toward it, and edged it forward.Just a little bit more.The spine of the book was now over the edge of the bookshelf.She grit her teeth, stretched up a little further, and tugged.The book fell.Spine down, it dropped like a brick weight, straight toward Viktors head.His face barely had time to register a look of surprise before his hands shot out reflexively to catch it.His hands, that she had noticed she had never really seen before, that were now sticking outside his cloak.Her gaze latched onto his right hand.His pale right hand that was beginning to heal over but was still covered in scabs and as white as snow.Then her gaze shot toward his face.He seemed to realize at the same time that she had tricked him, because he dropped the book to the ground.Rina reached back for the clay bowl reflexively and tossed it at his face.He yelled out in pain, the hot embers  She whipped around, ready to run toward the library doors, but an iron grip latched onto her wrist.Her breath caught in her throat.She tugged, hard, but the grip only tightened.Her gaze shot wildly around, landing on the jade bowl.Only one thought ran through her head: *he was going to kill her*.She had no other choice.She dove toward the bowl, managing to grab a handful of bones in her hand.He was now wiping the remaining ashes away, an expression of disgust and thinly veiled anger on his face.*Please, please, please.Just this once.* 

	
She looked down at the bones in her hand.The magic within her felt fuller than ever thanks to the adrenaline surging through her system.She focused on pushing as much of it as she could toward her palm.The bones crackled, then flared into blue flames.Within seconds, they had burnt to ash, and bats with translucent skin appeared in their place, chittering.*Yes*.Hope surged through her.Ingruo! she yelled, and she all but tossed them at Viktor.The bats fluttered their wings weakly before falling to the floor.Viktor had raised his arm to defend his face from the bats, but when he saw them twitching on the ground, he smiled.He bent over and calmly unlocked one of the drawers in the desk, ignoring her desperate attempts to claw at his arms and his face.You know, I was saving this for a very special occasion. He pulled out a sharp tooth, rubbing the sharp edge between his fingers.Rina stared at it in dread.He closed his eyes for just a moment, and then the tooth burst into an inferno, which he quickly dropped on the floor.The crackling flames were horrifying and mesmerizing all at once as it slowly grew and a form began to take shape from within.Rinas eyes widened.A snout with sharp fangs and sharp ears.And where its eyes should have been, black nothingness instead.Black smoke seemed to pour from the creature, darkening the room.Viktor let her go, and she fell to the ground, scrambling backwards.Ingruo, he commanded.The monstrous dog pounced at her, its sharp claws raking at her cloak as it stood on top of her, its heavy weight on her chest cutting off her ability to take in air.She could feel her breathing begin to come in short, erratic bursts, her brain beginning to fog.The dog growled, its teeth inches from her face.Viktor walked up.Sorry, its nothing personal.Youre just in my way.He shrugged, then glanced at the dog before backing up.Probably so he wouldnt get blood on his clothes, she thought, and she wanted to laugh.So this was how she was going to die.Without even having become a true necromancer.She closed her eyes as the dog reared back, its jaws gaping open.*Im sorry, mom.*

"What will you give me that I could want?"Kieran watched the player's avatar as he scratched his head--an idle gesture--as he contemplated the question.In Harkstone, Kieran was known as a trader.But he didn't just trade in in-game items.He traded in out-of-game items as well.Ones that he conjured out of thin air simply by thinking about them.He tapped his booted foot on the cobblestone path, then turned around and sat down on a wooden crate, bringing his sword in front of him so it settled on his lap.The player stared at his sword, his own tiny dagger hanging in its leather sheath.Kieran didn't blame him.His sword wasn't really a sword at all, but a curved, double edged blade that could serve as a gun as well.It was of a crescent shape, with a handle in the middle that extended out into a barrel with a trigger on the bottom.He had created it after he had gotten sick of players trying to come up and stab him in the back to see if he could die.It didn't hurt of course, but it was bothersome nonetheless.So a character death or two often taught them enough of a lesson to leave him alone.He yawned, glancing around the market.Little booths had been set up, each with a wooden platform and a cloth awning, selling wares.His own stand was simply a crate that changed location day by day.Otherwise he'd get flooded.All sorts of creatures roamed the streets.Elves, orcs, and even a Disney character or too.Those in particular were his doing.If there was one thing Kieran in his almighty status in this domain lacked, it was knowledge of the outside world.And for anyone who wanted an avatar that the game didn't provide, they needed a particularly juicy piece of info.He sighed."Kid, if you don't have anything, get moving.Come back when you're ready to answer."The player who was clearly new to the game--with nothing but tatters for clothes and simple cloth shoes--shuffled to the side."Sorry, Phantom."That was the nickname players had given him after realizing what he could do.Well--he glanced at the setting sun--that was it for the day.Getting up, he snapped his fingers, and the pile of crates that vaguely resembled a throne disappeared.Then he headed toward the outskirts of town, past all the fake brothels and boarded up shops.The game was still in beta, so some features hadn't been released yet.He could have just teleported, of course, but then he would have to find a way to fill up the long empty nights, somehow.Some days, he spent out in the town, participating in events such as the town dance.But he soon got sick of those as more and more players learned of his presence, instead crowding around him to try and get him to fulfill a wish.He walked into his cottage and had just set down his blade when a message popped up.*Kieran?* 

He froze.He pulled up the message, glancing at the username.Fayegirl97.He didn't understand why, but it rung a bell.*Who are you?* He sent the message off with a swipe of his hand in the air.Nothing.He paced back and forth, his boots scuffing the wooden floorboards.His hands clenched into fists.No one knew his real identity here.How had they found him?It didn't really matter, of course.Now that he was dead.But some sense of humanity still clung to him, some part that hated being outed without his permission.He could easily ban the user, and he would, as soon as he figured out what was going on.*Kieran, is it really you??It's Lisa!"He could feel goosebumps running down his arm.It wasn't possible.This had to be some kind of joke.It had to be.He pulled up the menu and pinpointed her location.The marketplace.Without hesitating, he teleported over to where she was, landing just a couple of paces behind her.She had a human avatar.Just a normal human one.And somehow, that knowledge gave him hope.Her account had just been created thirty seconds ago.He walked up, hesitantly.Maybe he was afraid she would disappear.That somehow, he had found the ability to dream, and she was just a figment of his imagination.She turned around, and he could see the small bubble above her head that indicated she was typing.*I asked one of your friends, and he said he knew your old username, so I tracked it to you, and I wasn't sure, but I had to try.* 

He could imagine her in real life now, the rim of her eyes red, as she held in her tears, her lower lip trembling.He could still conjure up the image of her face in his mind.Her round face, with so much baby fat, and her large eyes.Overriding the programming of the game, which currently didn't allow for physical contact, he walked forward and gave her a hug.It was an empty gesture; he couldn't feel it, but he knew she could see it on the screen.And that would have to be enough.Then he stood back, typing and wishing that he could say the words aloud, with his own voice.*Hey, little sis.How have you been?*

"Mr. Cicero--" 

"No, you don't understand."The man stared at him wild-eyed, shaking his head profusely.His hands clenched, his fingers wringing together as he tugged at the manacle on his wrist.The skin on his wrists had already begun peeling, slight lines of blood staining the metal, but he didn't seem to notice, instead his light blue eyes focused completely on the woman sitting in front of him."They can't do this again.I've already paid."Lilian met his gaze straight on, her gaze sweeping over his shaking body.Shaking from fear...or something else?"While that may be true, Mr. Cicero, you can understand the confusion.I hope you will work with us to make this right for you."Lilian tapped her pen on the metal table.The small vibration caused the man to jerk slightly."Damari."The man was silent for a second before he blinked."Right, yes?"Lilian's eyes narrowed.Damari Cicero was not a fearful man.In fact, he'd been a ruthless CEO whose merciless decisions had caused the millions of people to lose their jobs and homes.It was a rare day when Wall Street turned against one of their own, but he had been heartless enough to be feared by even those who worked with them.His hair, now long and unkempt, covered a third of his face.His clothing hung from his thin, gaunt frame.As far as she could tell, this man was not Mr. Cicero.They were simply too different."Did Mr. Cicero have a twin?"she asked casually.The man's eyes widened almost imperceptibly."No, of course not!"he said a little too quickly."Why would you think that?""Because, you, sir, are not him.Who are you?And why are you pretending to be him?"The man shook his head vigorously."I'm not.I'm...I..."he bit his lip, his leg shaking furiously under the table.His gaze darted left and right, unable to meet hers."He paid me a large sum," he finally blurted out."Because I looked just like him.He wanted to leave a legacy of being resurrected, and he said all I had to do was show my face to the police, but I didn't expect them to arrest me, and I--" He choked up, unable to continue.So that was what it was.Lilian's gaze softened.She did feel for the man.From the looks of it, he wouldn't have known what he would've gotten himself into.Her shoulders relaxed.She had come in here prepared to prep for another battle, only slightly easier in difficulty than the initial case she'd had of defending Cicero himself.There was no precedent of double jeopardy for a dead person.So did their death mean they were safe?Better this than some case that was destined to take years to go to the Supreme Court.It would've been the biggest mess.And that wasn't including the other ramifications of someone coming back from the dead.The press would go insane."You may go, Mr. --" Lilian paused."You may go.I will inform the police."She waved a police officer in and explained the situation.The man's cuffs were promptly removed, and he stood up, his legs still shaking."Thank you!Thank you so much!"he exclaimed, bowing to her with each step as he backed out of the room."I won't ever forget your kindness, Lilian!"Lilian nodded.The door clicked closed behind her as he left.What a strange thing for Damari to do.What was he even hoping to achieve?And how had he found the man in the first place?From what she knew of him, he-- 

Lilian froze.How had he known her name?She hadn't introduced her first name, and she knew the police only ever referred to her by her last name as well.So how--her eyes widened.She shot up, knocking her chair over the process.There was no way.It couldn't be.&nbsp;

The man took several steps out of the police station, then glanced back.He slicked his hair back, his spine straightening until he stood tall.Then he stuck his hands into his pocket and walked the other way.

"So you have to make sure to cut off the pads of their fingers, right?And to knock out their teeth.To make sure that they can't be recognized."Jeremiah rested his chin in the palm of his hand.She was quite off, but sure.He watched as Vanessa slowly stirred her coffee, then took a small sip.The rest of the cafe was filled with the quiet chatter of people going out their daily lives, living in the moment.Statistics say that people are liable to walk past sixteen murderers unwittingly in their lifetime.For those in the cafe, it was already two.He loved the thrill of being able to pick out his victims at ease."So how did you get into the field?"He took a bite of his own cookie, then brushed off the crumbs off of his suit.Normally, he wasn't into this type of girl.She was a little...dowdy for his tastes.She wore a simple t-shirt with jeans.And the t-shirt had a questionable stain on the front that she either didn't see or didn't care about.That simply wouldn't do."Oh, well, I've always liked using my imagination, you know?So I knew I wanted to be in a creative field.It was simply a matter of which one."Vanessa smiled at him shyly, a small dimple appearing on her right cheek."What about you?What do you do?"Jeremiah grinned back.Her blush didn't go unnoticed.He knew he was a handsome man.How could he not?After all, that was his MO.He charmed them, then lured them into his home."Also a creative field," he said blandly.For a moment, there was nothing between them but silence.Vanessa cleared her throat.Jeremiah's gaze followed as her left hand reaching up to tug on her curls and she bit her lip.She was nervous.He'd have an unusually easy time seducing this one.She wouldn't be any work at all."But, yeah.That's really only fantasy though.Readers like that stuff because of the drama.You shouldn't really kill someone like that in real life," Vanessa said.Jeremiah raised an eyebrow and leaned forward slightly."Do tell," he said."Well, there's no such thing as the perfect murder, right?So you're better off leaving all sorts of evidence so that the police have too much evidence to sift through.It makes it that much harder to prove that it was you beyond a reasonable doubt."Jeremiah's eyes flashed.Maybe she was pretty smart after all.He tapped his chin.That was a surprisingly acute observation, and one that not many people could come up with."That's really interesting," he said, making sure to keep his voice as toneless as possible.He didn't want to convey too much interest in the topic."Yeah, it is!And of course, if you're going to be a real serial killer, you probably shouldn't have an MO.The more boring the cases are, the less likely police will invest time and effort into it.And when you're killing someone in their own home, for example, you should always take the cash in their wallet.That way, police will have to view the possibility that it was a failed burglary attempt."He didn't miss the way her eyes sparkled as she talked about the topic.An idea sparked.A dangerous one, and one that he'd never have considered before meeting her.After all, he wasn't in the habit of keeping around prey.But perhaps this could be a symbiotic relationship.She looked like she desperately needed the company, and he could use the ideas.Maybe it was fate after all.She could be useful.Very, very useful.He took in a small breath and sat up straight.Vanessa immediately stopped talking, her large, brown eyes focused on his expectantly.Jeremiah smiled at her."Would you like to go out with me?"

"How's mom?"Kieran took in his sister's avatar.She had chosen almost the exact same features.Long, brown hair, a round face, and large eyes.And a stick-thin frame.He had always called her his little monkey.They differed almost six years in age; she had been an accident, and he had spoiled her beyond all reason.Now, she was seventeen, and he...he should have been twenty three.She looked away.They continued to walk down the marketplace street in silence, the only sound that of footsteps on the cobblestone.He had sealed this area so any user trying to come in would automatically glitch out.No doubt the devs would realize what was happening within half an hour.Lisa gazed up at the moon, noting that it really resembled the moon out in the real world.If there was one thing Harkstone was known for, it was realism."She still cries sometimes when she thinks I'm not listening," she finally said.Her breath came out as cloudy puffs, and she watched as the wisps of smoke drifted into the night sky that was brilliant with randomly generated stars.She had never thought she would see the same sky as Kieran ever again."We all miss you," she added softly, turning her head to gaze at him.Kieran looked away just as they passed a stall selling magic mirrors, catching a glimpse of his reflection.He had given himself long, white hair and rainbow eyes, and his features were elongated.His elf ears stuck out from underneath a black beanie.To be honest, he didn't resemble much of himself.Gone was the tiny crook in his nose from when he had broken it skateboarding, and gone were the scars and callouses on his hands from the woodwork he had done.He wished he had kept them now, all the imperfections.But, with a profound sadness, he realized he didn't even remember the details of what he had looked like.Two years was a long time to live in someone else's skin.His sister stopped by a stall selling snacks.She picked up an object that was shaped strangely, with a corn husk that peeled back to reveal small green globules."What's this?"He took one, feeling the slightly bouncy texture between his fingers, and popped it into his mouth.It exploded in a lemony tang, melting in his mouth."Try it, it's called a hob," he told her excitedly.She carefully placed it in her mouth and chewed.Then she shook her head.It didn't taste like anything.Of course.He forgot that VR hadn't progressed that far yet.But he didn't let that dampen his mood."Come on, let me show you something."He grabbed her hand, and in the blink of an eye, they were there.It was something you could never see in real life.They stood at the edge of a clearing.Behind them lay the forest, thick with trees, and they could hear the small chitter of creatures of various species darting through the underbrush.Sentient vines slowly climbed up and down the trees, waiting to snatch up unsuspecting players.But it wasn't the clearing that he wanted to how her.It was the outer rim of the generated world.Before them lay a vast darkness, one without even stars, and as much as it had scared him the first time he saw it, he had fallen in love with it.Lisa carefully looked down, noticing that the ground beneath her shimmered.She bent down, reaching her fingers toward the darkness, and felt a smooth cool surface.Kieran laughed.Ignoring her tiny scream, he calmly walked out."Don't worry, it's a glass floor," he said."I can do anything here.You'll be fine."Lisa took a small step out.When the nothingness beneath her feet didn't give out, she took another step, less hesitantly this time.Before she knew it, they were far out into the darkness.She looked behind her.There was such a clear line that separated the world and them right now.It was exhilarating.She glanced at her brother, who was busy creating small flying dragons that would squawk and screech before immediately beelining it toward the trees and away from the darkness.Her eyes widened."Kieran, what kinds of things can you do here?"He looked at her, his elf ears twitching."I can make small changes, like creating creatures or conjuring up weapons and gear.I can't change anything too large though, or the devs will notice."Her idea was crazy.It was absolutely, utterly insane."You're good at coding, right?Mom told me how you won that Turing award right before you...before you left because you made VR almost completely real.That's why we have these pods now, with tactile sensations and a feed that projects these images through the retinas.""Lisa..." He knew what she was thinking."I can get you a server.You can make a new world there, and when science progresses enough, maybe we can bring you back out in a new body."Her eyes were wide, her heart pumping in exhilaration.Or perhaps desperation.Kieran shook his head."I can't leave.I'm tethered here.If the connection is lost, I'll disappear."He didn't miss the fire in her eyes.She had always been a stubborn one."But...I have an idea."Harkstone was a vast world.Probably four to five times larger than earth, with almost seven million players online every day, and even after being here for two years, he still hadn't even explored 2% of it.Most of the time, he just traded.And he hadn't done the quests; after all, what was the point?"Let's play through the game together," he said."Legitimately.Didn't you always beg to play video games with me as a kid?This is your only chance," he joked.When she was younger, they played together often.He would pretend to be a pirate captain, taking her out into the seas.Or she was a princess, and he was the dragon who kidnapped her.But she hadn't been old enough for the video games.Their mom hadn't let her play.Oh, she had begged of course.She had refused to eat for two days and ended up in the hospital over it.But mom still hadn't budged.Lisa looked at him then, and he felt like he was seeing a little girl who had grown up.Who hadn't had a choice in growing up because tragedy often morphed you into a being older than you were ready to be."I won't give up on you," she said."But yeah.Let's play together.Finally.""One last adventure," he agreed.*****

Andrew wracked his brain."I have a family.Please, my child is sick and I'm the only one with a job in the family, and my wife has been severely ill since the pregnancy, and I just...please!"He didn't even understand the words coming out of his mouth.His mind had blanked as soon as he saw the black barrel of the gun facing toward him.The guy named Joey hawked a loogie at the ground and sneered at him."Bullshit.We were friends for so long, you think I don't know you don't have a wife and kid?Who are you joking?"Wait.They were friends?Then why Joey was trying to kill him--Franky?This didn't make sense.Andrew tried a different tactic."Look, I'm really sorry, man, I didn't mean to."Maybe it was his imagination, but Joey's shoulders seemed to relax the slightest bit.Andrew quickly glanced at his surroundings.He was in a run-down apartment.Trash littered almost every surface, with fast food bags everywhere.His eyes honed in on a picture frame sitting in the center of the kitchen table.The table was the only surface bare in the room, so it must've been important.In the frame was a picture of Joey with a woman with brown hair."He doesn't mean it, boss," a guy piped up from the couch, casually playing with a handgun."Don't listen to him."Joey raised a hand."Nah, I wanna listen to what he has to say.What are you sorry about, Franky?"His jaw set, he set his gaze on the man still tied up in the chair.Andrew panicked.He had no idea what he was supposed to be sorry for!But clearly Franky wasn't someone who was into apologies, otherwise Joey wouldn't be this shocked, and clearly they had once had a good relationship.Think, Andrew, think!"I'm sorry about what I said or did.I really didn't mean to.I wasn't thinking at the time, and I'm sorry that I've betrayed our friendship like this.Truly.Please forgive me."Andrew held his breath.That was as specific of an apology as he could get without revealing that he didn't know what the hell he was actually talking about.But it seemed to appease Joey, to an extent.The beefy man glared at him, even as he dropped the gun to his side."It was your condescension I hated.I looked up to you, man.And you treated me like trash.Told me that you were just using me, and for what?For a couple thousand dollars?"His face contorted, and Andrew felt his heart slow.He felt sorry for Joey.The man was clearly in pain over the loss of a bad friend."My wife...she's dead because of you!"he shouted, slamming his fist into a wall."We needed that money so badly.I shouldn't have lent it to you.I shouldn't have..." he murmured, retreating into his own thoughts.Andrew felt his body heat up.Whoever Franky was, he deserved to die.How could anyone do this?This guy was clearly scum.He glanced at the clock on the wall.*45 seconds.* Could he do it?He had just enough time left if he was quick."Actually, she deserved it," he said."She was a dumb bitch for not being able to deal with the pressure."His heart pounded in his ears.*48 seconds.*

"What did you say?"Joey asked, his voice dangerously low as he lifted his head.His eyes were bloodshot as he stared at Franky in disbelief.*52 seconds.* 

"I said she deserved to die, and you're such a coward you would never shoot me," Andrew taunted."I dare you.Shoot me!"he shouted.*57 seconds.* 

Joey cocked the gun in his hand.*58 seconds.* 

"Go to hell," he said, aiming the gun toward Franky's head.This is for my wife. Andrew barely saw his finger pull the trigger when his vision went white.*60 seconds.*

Jeremiah whipped around and glared at his friend.Maddy sat there, blinking her big, brown eyes and shook her head."I didn't do anything," she said."You clearly did!The chances of getting that weapon is a million to one.How'd you get it on the first try?"She shrugged her shoulders and laughed awkwardly."I'm lucky?"He narrowed his eyes, but didn't call her out further.He handed her back the game controller."Okay, but only as long as you're using your abilities for good," he joked, his gaze still half suspicious."I want the same weapon.Bet?"She grinned at him, her eyes lighting up as the dimple in her cheek became more pronounced."Of course!"Jeremiah's heart skipped a beat, his cheeks turning a ruddy red.He wondered if she knew that he knew.Whenever he turned around, she'd always be following him around with her gaze.He gently bumped her shoulder with his, secretly enjoying the way her cheeks turned bright red.Then he turned back to the television screen, an almost undetectable trace of a smile on his face.&nbsp;

"I mean, what are the chances that we're actually soulmates?"Maddy asked.She took in a deep breath, relishing in the rich, cool scent of the mountain air as she gazed at the tiny pinpricks of light high above them.The grass was cool on her bare arms."A million to one," Jeremiah said, reaching his arm out.She lifted her head, then laid back down, using his arm as a cushion.The air was a little brisk, so she scooted closer to him, breathing in his familiar scent.She loved the way he smelled."It was a miracle," he murmured, turning his head to kiss her on the forehead."Like that basketball shot you landed," she said, giggling.He glared at her, indignant."Hey, I'm not *that* bad.""You're right.Joey's just a lot better.It's all relative."Jeremiah sat up, turning towards her and glaring at her."If he's so good at basketball, why don't you go date him?"Maddy laughed, the sound lost in the wind as she sat up as well, wrapping her arms around him.He struggled the tiniest bit before settling down and letting her dote on him."But I don't love him," she cooed, leaning her head against his shoulder.He sniffed."Good," he said."Bet."She kissed him full on the lips, sticking her tongue out playfully when he turned his head to the side, embarrassed."Bet."&nbsp;

Maddy collapsed on the floor.Her friend, Ada, leaned down to help her back up."Please, doctor, there must be another way."The doctor shook his head."His illness is just too rare.This is the first time we're performing a surgery like this.The odds aren't good.""Please save him.Please save him."Those were the only words she could mumble.Her hand went to her stomach.It was too soon.She hadn't even had a chance to tell him about their child yet.They had so much left to do.They had to go bungee jumping together still.Climb Mount Everest.Attend a game show.A wail came out of her, so high and keening that it sounded inhuman.She couldn't lose him like this.She simply couldn't."You should sign the waiver," Ada said, after Maddy had calmed down the slightest bit."It's his best chance."Maddy nodded numbly.The degeneration was rapid.The time Jeremiah spent awake these days grew smaller and smaller, and the doctors said that it wouldn't be long before he wouldn't wake up at all.So two hours later, she watched them cart the love of her life into that cold, metal room from which he might not return.It was a sixteen hour surgery, they said.She made a bet with herself.If she could stay by his side, in front of the emergency room for those sixteen hours without leaving, then he couldn't leave her.It was a stupid bet.One that made no sense at all.But it was the only thing that gave her comfort in that moment, when she couldn't feel anything through her frozen fingertips.The seconds passed by like years.She didn't know how long she stood there, staring at the brightly glowing red sign until it blinked off.The doctor walked out, his face still covered by his surgical face mask.Maddy felt her heart begin to beat so wildly she thought it might burst."Is?...is he?"she asked, the question coming out as more of a whisper.The doctor took off the mask, and it was then that she could see the wide grin on his face."It's a miracle," he said."Congratulations.The surgery was a success."He took a deep breath, shaking his head in disbelief."I didn't want to tell you exactly how low the chance was, but it's actually a miracle.""How low was it?"Maddy asked, the slightest bit of warmth coming back into her fingers.The doctor looked at her, his eyes bright."A million to one."

Lucien stared at his wife, slack-jawed.She had to be joking.There was no way they were *married* and she just now thought fit to tell him.His eyes narrowed as he gazed at her sleeping, composed face that he normally found so much joy in seeing and his lips thinned.Gods didn't age, huh?*** 

"Aaaah!Lucien!What did you do?"A shrill shriek came from the bedroom as Lucien casually sipped at his coffee.Black, with two sugars.Just the way he liked it.He flipped the next page of the newspaper and tutted.The world was such a mess.Seconds later, Hera burst through the doorway, her blonde hair sticking up in all directions as she glared at him."You did this didn't you?"she spat.Lucien looked up at the poor, whimpering mess she held up at him.It was her beloved Sphynx cat.A light pink before, its skin was now a dull gray, its head covered with wrinkles as it yowled at her in protest.She set it down carefully before turning back to him and glaring at him."Don't you think you're being too juvenile?Was it really that important that I tell you that I'm a god?"Lucien put down his newspaper and stared at her."Yes!I think any normal person would want to know that!""Well you didn't have to take it out on Beatrice!Turn her back right now!"Lucien sniffed and turned his head away from her."I shan't."Hera's eyes narrowed."I see.So this is how you want to play it, don't you?"Then she whipped around, her nightgown billowing behind her, and stalked back into the bedroom.***

"Hera, you've gone too far this time."Lucien said through clenched teeth and walked up to his wife as she was powdering her nose in front of her dresser mirror."What happened, dear?"Hera asked.She took a closer look in the mirror.Was she growing a mole?She blinked, and then it was gone.Good."You better cancel the rain.I swear to God.""You're swearing to me, by the way.""Goddamn it, Hera!""Still me!"Lucien pressed a hand to his wife's shoulder and turned her to look at him."If they keep cancelling the Giants game because of your little downpours, I'm going to have to resort to desperate measures," he said through clenched teeth.Hera stuck her tongue out at him, then walked into the bathroom."Do it then!"she taunted him."Let's see what you got!"***

Hera looked down at the little ball of plump, pink cat on the bed, bewildered.Had Lucien turned Beatrice into a kitten again?A pair of hands slipped through her arms and around her waist."Like my surprise?"a deep voice whispered in her ear."I thought you were going to do your worst," Hera said, her hands coming down to feel his hands.His palms were rough."These *are* my desperate measures.I really, really need to watch the game.I know you've wanted another one.I had to go beg Hades to give me another one.He nearly had my arm for it."Hera's eyes lit up, and she turned around to face her gorgeous husband, with his angular cheekbones and bright blue eyes."So this isn't Beatrice!You got me an undead Sphynx!How'd you even get Hades to part with her?"Lucien grimaced."I had to agree to be his secretary for the next hundred years.Did you know Hell has a million people going in every day?A million!"Hera smiled at him then, then pecked him on the lips."I'm sorry for not telling you.I promise I will next time.And I'll see if my father can't talk to him and reduce your sentence just a little bit. "Lucien raised an eyebrow."Next time?"Hera didn't respond.Swaying her hips, she walked over to the bed and set the undead Sphynx cat into the rocking chair next to it.She turned her smoky eyes on Lucien and curled her index finger at him, sending him a come hither look."Come on, cowboy.Let's see what you've earned."

"Hey, you're new, right?"Richard nearly jumped out of his seat and whipped around.He hadn't expected anyone to come from behind him.He took in the young girl who couldn't have looked older than fourteen.She had straight, jet-black hair, and her features were rounded and soft, with lots of baby fat that made her look younger than she probably was.His brows furrowed."What are you doing here?"The girl stared at him like he was crazy."Why else?I live here."Lived here?This girl was living in Hell?She was way too young for that.It didn't make sense.Seeing that he wasn't about to speak anytime soon, she proffered a hand."I'm Elise.Nice to meet you."Her hand was soft and cool."I'm Richard.I'm Maxis's replacement."She nodded."I figured.I'm glad she's finally found peace."She smiled, and for a second, Richard wondered how anyone who was living in such a horrid place could smile so happily."Come on, let me show you around.You can have Maxis's room.It's been cleaned already."He had a room?He stood up and followed her down the cloudy path.It was nearly impossible to see more than a couple feet away through the clouds and fog, but Elise walked confidently a little ways down before making several turns.After a while, the fog began to clear, and Richard was left gaping at a huge mansion.It didn't look horrible at all.Where were the vines and the dead animals and the torture?Where were the lava pits and the demons?He glanced around.Was he dreaming?Maybe he hadn't died at all, and this was just an elaborate prank.In front of the mansion, an old lady tended to a rose garden while an older man sheared the hedges.A small water fountain sat in the center of the front lawn, where a sparkling amber liquid cascaded down."What's that?"he asked."Oh, that's just water," she said."It tastes like whatever you want it to though.You can try it if you like."She produced a cup from thin air and handed it to him.He carefully dipped the cup into the fountain and brought it out.Tastes like whatever you want?That sounded fake.The image of grapes popped into his mind, and he brought the amber liquid to his lips.Grape juice flavor assaulted his senses, and he nearly choked on the water in surprise.Elise simply threw her head back and laughed, a sound like the tinkle of bells."Told you so."Richard wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, his face ruddy with embarrassment."Alright, let's go," he said.Elise simply nodded and glanced at him once more with amusement before turning and walking towards the mansion, greeting everyone taking a walk outside as she passed them and introducing him as the newest member of Hell.Richard peeked at them as she made the introductions.Maureen was a chubbier older woman who had a kind visage.The corner of her eyes crinkled when she smiled.George was a lanky young man of twenty seven with dark bags under his eyes.At first, he'd looked surly, but he brightened upon seeing Elise.And Alan was an old man who looked probably eighty.His wife, Elaine, rolled his wheelchair as they did a slow lap around the gardens.Elise knocked on the front door once, and it opened.Richard peered in, but there was no one on the other side.Although the outside was magnificent looking, the inside was a little shabbier, reminding Richard more of a bed and breakfast rather than opulence and wealth.A small foyer with an old elevator in the center extended into three hallways going in three different directions.Elise took the right hallway.Each door they passed had a nameplate on it, although most of them didn't have names.She finally reached a door that said "Richard" in fancy text and pointed to it."Here's your room!Come down in an hour or so for dinner.If you walk outside, the cafeteria is just to the left.It looks like a dome."&nbsp; 

The room was nothing fancy.It had a full-size bed with a wooden bed-frame and a wooden table with a chair at the other lamp.A dresser sat in the corner, although what he was supposed to do with it, he wasn't quite sure.No one had brought clothes with them to the afterlife, and there couldn't possibly be clothing stores there.That would be preposterous.It appeared whoever had cleaned the room hadn't cleaned it entirely because a photo frame still stood on the desk.Richard picked it up.A woman with brown hair smiled into the camera, next to a tall, handsome man, who held a baby in his hands.It was clearly of Maxis.He turned the frame over, then back again.But back then, there had been no cameras.So was it a memory then?Was that how things worked here?Through memories?After an hour of laying on his bed, contemplating everything that had happened, he headed towards the cafeteria.He was the first one there.Apparently it was self serve, so he got a tray and ladled some chicken and mashed potatoes onto his plate before sitting down at one of the three long tables.It wasn't long before Elise joined him, her plate piled high with nachos and pie.He raised an eyebrow.He hadn't seen anything like that in the line.As if she understood his confusion, she said, "The food you see is based on what food you feel like having at the moment."Then she dug in.That only made Richard more confused.They weren't treated badly at all.In fact, some people would have killed to live this sort of existence in real life.It wasn't super luxurious, no, but it was a living.And it was a pretty good one.If there was one thing that confused him the most though, it was the people.Everyone he met was genuinely *nice.* Maureen had a daughter she wouldn't stop talking about.George liked to watch football.Elaine never left Alan's side as she fed him.And Alan...well, Alan just stared ahead blankly.He'd thought Hell would have been full of serial killers and murderers...or should have, if it wasn't by choice.So what made these people, who seemed to be living alright lives, choose Hell?After dinner, he took a walk around the gardens.The roses had been pruned quite nicely, and the hedges were trimmed well, thanks to George.He found a pair of swings and sat down at one.He gazed up at the stars.He didn't know how long had passed before a shadow passed by and sat down in the swing next to him."Hi," Elise said softly."What are you thinking about?""I'm thinking about why these people are in Hell," Richard answered truthfully."In fact, I'm wondering why you're in Hell.You've been nothing but kind to me since I've arrived.And why is Hell like this?It's nothing like I had imagined."He had done it.He had finally asked all the questions he'd been curious about.He looked over at Elise, who was gazing up at the stars.She looked...sad.There was such pain in her slouched shoulders and dark eyes that Richard felt his throat close up."Only kind people would be in Hell," she said softly."They chose it because they don't believe they deserve better."She looked down at the ground, her tennis shoe scuffing at the dirt."Hell doesn't need to be full of terrible torture methods because, at night, everyone already tortures themselves enough living in their own personal hell."The swing made a soft creaking sound as she swung back and forth."Maureen believes she killed her daughter.She was driving drunk, and she survived, but her daughter didn't.Elaine believes she's responsible for Alan losing his cognitive abilities.She had injected too much medicine in him one day, and the next day, he'd become the way he was.And me..." She laughed, but it sounded hollow."I ruined my sister's life because I was jealous of her."She closed her eyes and swallowed.Then she turned to Richard, giving him a small, sad smile."Let me let you in on a secret.You can actually leave Hell anytime you'd like.You could leave now if you wanted to.As soon as you defeat your personal demons first.Heaven's gate is always wide open."Then she walked off, back towards the house, leaving Richard to sit there alone, listening to the sound of the swing creak softly in the wind.

Ava opened the door to greet them, blinking at the random stranger who had appeared alongside her friend.She glanced at Mia questioningly."Um, he's, um...a relative.His name is Kane.""Oh, nice to meet you, Kane."She smiled at him, her eyes warm and inviting as the opened the door a little more so they could walk into her apartment.As Mia walked in, she gave him a look.Be an ass, the look said.Kane froze.What was the lingo even like twenty or thirty years ago?His gaze shifted around the apartment.2018.So that was...fifteen years ago."Yeah, thanks...babe.Um, nice ass by the way.I'd tap that," he said awkwardly.Then he made little guns out of his thumbs and index fingers and tried to wink at her.He glanced at Mia after to see if he'd done okay.Her eye twitched."He's kind of an ass, but I still love him."She tried to laugh it off and patted Ava's back, then sat down on the couch, her gaze burning holes into his face.Try harder.Ava hadn't given him a look of disgust.She just stared at him curiously before nodding.He sat down on the couch next to Mia, then got up and shifted over to the couch Ava had settled into when Mia gave him another look.He purposely spread his legs so his knees bumped against hers, then spread out his arms on the back of the couch to take up as much space as possible.Mia nodded slightly in approval.Better.Ava didn't like egotistical men, so if he acted like a douchebag, maybe she would hate him.And then, maybe, she'd live a long happy life.He shifted slightly.The position was highly uncomfortable.When he moved, the light scent of peaches wafted toward him.Was that her shampoo?Unwittingly, he had leaned closer to get another whiff, and she was now smiling at him."Do you like it?I just got a new conditioner."She raised a small strand of hair and brought it under his nose.The scent of peaches got stronger."Uh, nah."He purposely leaned away from it and scrunched his nose."I only like the smell of Axe.I don't like that really sissy shit," he said, trying to keep his face as expressionless as possible, even though the back of his ears burned with the shame of the words that came out of his mouth."Oh."The corners of her lips quirked upward."Is that right?""Yeah."Luckily, the conversation turned away from him after that, and he was able to try to maintain his facade of being arrogant and ignorant in peace.Maintaining the look of disdain on his face for the next hour took almost everything out of him, and by the time Mia finally said that she had to go home because she still had a test the next day, Kane's legs were sore from splaying them so far apart.It didn't help that he had worn shorts, so he could feel the softness and warmth of Ava's skin against his own.When Ava closed the door behind them after letting them out, and once they were in the elevator on the way down, Mia turned to him."I know you were trying to look like a douchebag, but you honestly just came off looking constipated.I'm pretty sure Ava was more worried for you than disgusted."He rubbed his sore shoulders."I really tried.""Try harder," she said grumpily.The next couple of weeks, Mia tried to maximize the time they spent with Ava, all in the name of destroying his reputation.And he tried.He really tried.But as time went on, he got more and more exhausted with pretending to be a woman-hating asshole.A lot of it was because...he was falling in love.He knew he shouldn't.He knew that they had no future together because if she came to love him--something he both wanted and couldn't dare wish for--then she would die for him.Over and over again.And he wouldn't wish that upon anyone, much less someone he loved.But he couldn't help it.He loved the way she pulled out time to play with kids on the playground.He loved the way she would twitch her nose slightly when she was annoyed with something.He loved the way she chewed on the end of her pencil whenever she was doing a mock test for her psychology class.And something he couldn't tell Mia: he loved the way she would laugh when he was acting like a douchebag instead of hating him for it.It drove Mia nuts, and she was constantly on the verge of pulling her hair out.Maybe Ava knew it was an act.Maybe that's why she was always smiling at him with those dimples and making his heart jump.Worst of all, maybe he wanted her to know.*****

Her head pounded.Luna groaned and brought a hand to her temple, massaging it.She was never going to drink again.Then again, it hadn't really been her choice.It had either been drink or suffer through another night of missing his sorry ass.Her eyes slowly blinked open.Above her head, the stars illuminated the night sky in a way she'd never seen before, shining so brightly she felt like she could almost reach up and catch one.Then she blinked again.The night sky?She shot up, her head whipping around and taking in the road lined with stone buildings.No wonder her pillow had been so hard.She'd been laying on the cobblestone path.The only light came from the torches that were set up in intervals along the road.Where are on earth was she??She was supposed to be in her bedroom.Luna scrambled to her feet, taking in the empty streets and the medieval looking buildings.This couldn't be possible.No.There wasn't a single soul in sight, and the only sounds came from the crackling fire of the torches."Hello?"she asked cautiously.Her voice--higher pitched than usual--echoed in the empty street.The silence was unnerving.So, rubbing her arms with her hands to warm them up against the slight chill of the night air, she moved on.If she could find someone, she could ask them what was going on.If this was some kind of sick joke.Walking up to the nearest house, she pulled up the bronze knocker and knocked three times.After a moment, no one had answered, so she knocked again."Hello?"she yelled, cupping her hands around her mouth."Is there anyone there?"Suddenly, she heard it.A sound like hooves clopping against cobble, and not just one, but many, many of them.Distant, but after a moment, they became accompanied by yelling and shouting.Luna panicked.She had no idea who these people might be, and if she'd really by some strange twist of fate ended up sometime else in history, the history lessons Mrs. Moore taught her didn't go forgotten.A girl sitting out in the streets meant certain death.So without a second thought, she began sprinting down the road as fast as her legs would take her.Faster than she'd ever run in her life, without daring to take a glance back.The sound of hooves grew closer, and she could hear the voices more clearly now.They didn't speak English.The speech patterns were smooth and rapid, but it was not a language she recognized.It was coming from a ways behind her, slightly to the left, but soon enough they would be on the road, and they would be able to see her.Just as she was about to break out in a sob, lamenting her fate, something tugged on her arm, dragging her into relative darkness.They slapped a hand against her face, muffling her cries, and dragged her deeper into the alleyway.She was going to die.She was going to die in some random place and time in history or in her dream, and she wouldn't have had a chance to apologize to her best friend.Even as she reached back to try to claw at the person, they nimbly dodged her attack."Be quiet, unless you want to die."There was a slight accent to the guttural voice, but it was recognizably female.Confused, Luna stopped struggling.By now, they had left the main road a little ways, and the person had dragged her behind a large barrel that reeked of fish.Not more than a second later, their surroundings lit up as the reflection of flames danced on the building walls, the sound of keening and loud shouting mixing with clopping sounds as the men on horses blazed past.Her heart pounding in her chest, Luna breathed in large breaths through her nose.When it finally became silent again, after what seemed like a million seconds ticked by, the person finally let go of her, removing their hand from her mouth.She spit out the taste of grime and dirt, wiping her mouth on her sleeve.Then she whipped around.And stared at the girl who was probably around her age, or maybe a little older.It was hard to tell because of the dim lighting and because of the grime that covered the girl's face.But there was no mistaking the large, clear eyes, the pigtails, and the cloth dress."You must not come out after dark," the girl implored her in the same guttural voice, and for a second, Luna wondered if the girl smoked.Then the girl turned around and began to walk towards the other direction."Wait!"Luna walked up and grabbed her hand, feeling the rough calluses on the girl's palm.It felt like the hand of an woman who had lived many, many years."Where am I?And who are those men?Why did you save me?"The questions spilled out like a waterfall, the sentences running over each other in their haste to escape.The girl glanced at her with pity in her eyes."You have lost your home?So have many of us to the Riders.""No, wait.I haven't...where are we?What year is this?"The girl gasped."They have taken your memory too."She reached up with one hand and caressed Luna's face, the roughness of her fingertips strangely calming."It is the fourteen hundredth and ninety-seventh year of our lord.You are in England."*****

On the shores of a blue-green planet in Milky Way, there is a species that has created a home from what was once a wasteland of meteoric ash.In their own dialect, this planet is called "Earth."Humans, also known as Homo Sapiens, have a very peculiar feature that distinguishes them from the rest of their planets' inhabitants.They thrive because of, and indeed in spite of, their intellect.They are indeed a peculiar bunch.From their humble beginnings as Neanderthals, one of the smaller creatures on the planet at the time, especially when compared against animals like the Woolly Mammoth, they have found ways to survive.Hunting in packs, they hunted down mammoths almost fifty times their size with crude, sharp weapons constructed from wood and stone.Then, from the carcass of these giants, they managed to create life.The meat was used for sustenance, the tusks used to create stronger, sharper weapons.The wool used for warmth, for their pale, fleshy skin was not meant for such cold climates.Beyond all odds, they survived.As time slowly went on, Earth entered into what is now known as the Age of the Homo Sapiens.A golden age for humans, where they span every last inch of the earth, even moving into Earth's stratosphere.Some creatures, such as cows and pigs, offer up their flesh to the cause, born and bred to expand the vast human empire.Other creatures like cats and dogs offer their unwavering support, accompanying humans wherever they go, serving as companions for these powerful creatures.In return, they receive protection from the elements.And finally, those who have chosen to abstain from this path, now live in hiding away in the far corners of the earth, waiting for the day when they might rise again.Indeed, the planet Earth no longer consists of merely natural creatures.It boasts an impressive 8.7 million different species, some evolving from the planet's creation.But others, created by the hands of these humans.Monstrous creatures incapable of surviving on their own.Humans, who live in large colonies and yet still seek companionship, have customized and created their own companions, including what is known as a 'pug.'Humans have outlasted every other organism on the planet thus far, despite their flimsy limbs and fragile skin.They have dominated the planet, destroying every possible barrier in their path.They have created machines to fly through the skies because their limbs are too weak to swim across the vast expanses of water.They have created machines to wage war against each other, now lacking other adversity.Their hunger for destruction knows no bounds.And so, it appears, they have turned their sights on the last possible outlet for their rage.They are destroying the planet itself.

"What's that?"You point to the swirling ball of light to your left.The vivid colors blend together in intricate, delicate spirals of red, blue, and pinpricks of white, not unlike the ones you created from glass.You can still feel the molten heat on your fingertips through the thick gloves."It's a collapsing nebula."Aesha looks up through the glass with you, her wisps of antennae moving back and forth as she stares straight ahead.Her eyes are completely black, with no pupils or irises to speak of."Space is filled with clouds of gas.And when they grow too large, gravity takes hold, leading them to collapse.""I see."The image of chubby hands grasping yours makes your eyes dim.You were never good with goodbyes.And now, you'll likely never get one."That's...sad," you say.You're unsure why you're telling this alien what you're thinking, but it's release, in a way."I never much liked endings.""All things end."Aesha's voice is soft as she says this.You look over, and despite the lack of emotion in her face--Sharzis do not show emotion, she told you earlier--there is a sadness to the way her antennae droop.You look away.Just because they do not show emotion does not mean they do not feel it."But that does not mean everything ends."You cock your head to the side, unsure of what kind of wordplay she's performing.Aesha points to a speck of white in the center of the nebula."Do you see that?"You nod."When a nebula collapses, a star is born."She turns toward you, and maybe it's your imagination, but you can see in her dark eyes the reflections of millions of stars, a galaxy in them.&nbsp;

"It is not the end.It is the beginning."

I am so so so sorry for the late upload.The craziest stuff has happened this past weekend and I've just had no time to write at all.But anyways, here it is!The next chapter will be the epilogue!*****

Something had been nagging at him ever since the incident with the pastor.Kael didnt usually care about what his father didoftentimes they would go days without speakingbut there was something strange about the way his father was acting that made him cautious.For instance, his father, who usually wore a business suit when he wasnt busy with necromancer business, had taken to wearing a cloak almost constantly.And when he wasnt, such as the day before yesterday, when his father had *suggested* that he and Rina take dinner with him, he had been wearing a business suit with gloves.Then, there was the meeting with the council.Aliza had been missing less than 48 hours at that point, and it was almost unheard of for the council to appoint a new leader until there was confirmation that either the current leader was incapacitated or had performed an act to make them worthy of being cast out.He had wanted to interject when his father had basically forced Rina to hand over the leadership position.Because without her knowledge, that was what had happened.As the future successor and rightful leader pro tempore, Rina had unwittingly given the position away.But the event had also made Kael suspicious.Suspicious that his father had something to do with Alizas disappearance, and with the pastors death.But he hadnt had evidence.Not, at least, until late last night.He walked up to the door of the library and took a deep breath.Whenever his father was home, it was always a guaranteed bet to find him here.Then he turned the doorknob and opened the door.Kael froze.It was difficult to process what he was seeing at first.A huge creature was hunched over what appeared to be a girl, her hair splayed out in black waves over the wooden floors.Her eyes were tightly shut, facing toward him as her pale face and lack of movement indicated she had probably passed out at this point, or was close to.*Rina.* 

And a couple steps away, his father, who had whipped around to face him when he had walked in.Kael! he barked.Get out! 

Caesum, Kael simply said, his gaze focused on the creature.He wasnt expecting it to work, but the creature that had been growling and baring its fangs before suddenly stopped.It turned to face him, the sockets where its eyes should have been seemingly glowing from within, tinging the black smoke a light blue.It cocked its head.Kaels heart dropped to the pit of his stomach.His hands balled into fists.He took large steps toward the creature, and before his father could take a step forward, he placed his hand on the creatures head, feeling its smooth, ghostly skin against his palm, almost like plastic stretched taut.Requiescat in pace, he whispered, allowing his magic to pulse through his palm.The creature whimpered, then slowly dissolved into a fine ash that disappeared into the air.He turned toward his father, who simply stood there.So you lied about that too.It wasnt enough that you thought Marrok was a pest and euthanized him because of it. His voice was deadpan.You kept his bones so you could use him. 

Viktors adam apple bobbed up and down for a moment before he stepped forward and tried to place a hand on Kaels arm.Kael simply stared at him, his face expressionless.Viktors hand awkwardly fell back to his side.As a protective measure, he explained.His gaze hardened.Im doing my best to protect my familys interests.Everything I do is so you can have a better future. 

Kael scoffed.A better future?As a murderer? 

Its not murder if their souls arent dead. 

Kael looked at his father in disbelief.His father, who was standing there calmly, saying these words as if it was normal everyday conversation.Is that why you didnt even visit my mother when she was dying then?Because you thought, oh, her souls not dead?

Viktor was silent for a moment.Your mother and Iwe had adifficult relationship.I wanted things for you that she didnt, and 

It was only difficult because she didnt want you to be so ambitious! Kael spat.Furiously, he reached into his pocket and pulled an object, tossing it at his father.Viktor barely managed to catch it with his left hand.He slowly opened his palm, and when he did, his expression changed.His gaze snapped up toward Kaels.How did you get this? he snarled, holding up the orb that was tinged purple instead of blue, as it should have been.It was the orb of the Lyngrave clan--the one Aliza should have been holding.Kael simply pulled out a rat bone from his pocket, then put it back.When he was younger, his father had taught him how to use necromancy to steal by sending out small creatures.And as a young boy, he had thought it was a fun game.What a cool father he had, he had thought.He was teaching him all these tricks.But now he knew better.His fathers eyes flashed, a stormy grey that threatened to devour him.Kael might have been afraid of that gaze once, but not anymore.Then, the storm calmed, and his father was composed once more.Almost eerily so.Kael, he said.Youll understand this when youre older, but only power can keep you safe. He looked down at the orb in his hand, then back at his son.Youll be telling the council, I assume? 

Yes. 

His fathers expression almost made him hesitate.He seemed to age decades in minutes, the wrinkles on his forehead becoming more pronounced.Kael had been tensed the entire time, expecting his father to launch spells at him or try to kill him.But he simply stood there.It was unnerving.Then, Viktor slowly made his way back over to his desk and sat down.Good, he said.Ill be waiting for you here.

Kael froze for a moment.Telling the council would be signing his death warrant.His father would be cast out and stripped of his necromancy powers.And no matter how much he despised his father, he couldnt completely hate him.After all, this was the father who had been kind and gentle when he was younger, teaching him everything he knew, no holds barred.And maybe some of his resentment toward his father came from the fact that his father was no longer who he thought him to be.He took a deep breath.Then, he turned around, bent over and picked Rina up, carrying her in his arms, and walked out the door.He didnt look back.Viktor sat there, listening to the tick of the clock as the library fell into silence.This wasnt the ending he had envisioned.But it was alright, nonetheless.When Kael told the council, they would trust him irrevocably from that point on as a boy who could even out his father for the greater good.Perhaps things were better this way.Now Kael would take over his spot on the council.Originally, to gain leadership, Kael would have had to prove himself, but now, the council would be appeased by his good deed and let him in without a fight.Kaels future was set for success.So that meant he had fulfilled his duty as a father.And he had fulfilled it quite well.*****

*Eat it.You know you want to.* 

James swallowed.His taste buds salivated at the sight of the cupcake in front of him.He could already taste the sweetness of the icing coating his tongue, feel the rush of oxytocin and bliss that would overwhelm him immediately after.He was no stranger to sweets, after all.He squeezed his eyes shut.*Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.* 

*But who would want to fuck a pile of bones?* 

James's eyes shot open."Who said that?"he blurted out, his gaze whipping around the kitchen.The morning sun still shone through the windowpanes with the same vigor despite what must be the accumulation of at least ten years of dust.The fading, peeling wallpaper didn't help matters either, the cracks running through it speaking to a possible mold problem.The sparse decorations in the room--a chair and a small dining table meant for one--didn't respond to the question.The cuckoo clock on the wall, the only heirloom he had left from his parents, ticked softly.His shoulders relaxed slightly.He must've been hallucinating again.It had started recently, likely due to the hunger that gnawed away at him more and more.But it was really no big deal.There were worse things to experience than hunger.He brought a hand to his head as his temple began to ring again.He shook his head vigorously, his eyes shifting back to the cupcake on the table.He'd bought it on a whim--something he never did.James sighed.He grabbed the cupcake.He'd toss it away.Then he wouldn't be tempted, and his five years of hard work wouldn't go to waste over one single moment of weakness.But when he stood up, the strength seemed to suddenly sap from his body.He fell back down in his chair, slightly confused.He couldn't even find the energy to walk the ten steps necessary to the trash can.In fact, he felt very much like taking a nap.His head began to dip.His mouth opened wide in a yawn as he slumped into the hard wooden chair that was suddenly quite comfortable.He'd throw the cupcake away later.It could wait.He set it down on the table, then slumped forward, his head pillowed on his arms.Just a tiny, short nap.&nbsp;

*This boy's gonna throw away his life over some bullies?Is he stupid?* 

*You can't call people stupid!That's not nice!* 

*Yeah, well, being a dumbass ain't nice either, you ever thought of that?* 

*Wrath, being a douchebag isn't a JOB, you know.You don't always have to be act like that.* 

*Oh yeah?Well, if Gluttony weren't such a FATASS, maybe we wouldn't always be out of food and I wouldn't have to be so angry now, would I?And Sloth just "can't seem to contain himself," always stopping them from leaving the house.You think I don't know how the other two died?They straight starved to death, thanks a lot.* 

It was a dream.It had to be.James kept his breathing shallow, his eyes still buried in his arms but opened wide now.The voices sounded much too real to be a hallucination.*Everyone just calm down!Anger isn't good for your skin!* 

*FOR THE LAST TIME, WE DON'T HAVE SKIN, NUMNUTS!* 

James jerked at the loud shriek.The room fell deathly silent.He bit his lip, squeezing his eyes shut.Who had been talking?Ghosts?Maybe if he kept pretending to sleep, they would go away.*Oh great, and now the gig is up.Nice going, weebs.* 

*That's not how you use that word.* 

*Sure, Mr.Academic.* The voice took on a mocking tone.*I'm Pride.I'm soooooo smart.I stick Lust's stick up my ass when she isn't looking and then it COMES OUT THE OTHER END AS WORDS.* 

James's head shot up.He wasn't sure what he had expected to see, but the people in front of him--despite being translucent and colorless--looked...surprisingly human.One guy leaned against the counter, glaring at the taller, thin man in front of him, while three girls sat in a row on the counter on the other side of the sink.He blinked.They were ghosts.They were most definitely ghosts.The guy leaning against the counter glared at him, his eyes flashing.*We're not ghosts, idiot.This is just our chosen physical manifestation.It's easier for you dumb humans to understand.* 

"Understand what?"From the annoyed tone, James could immediately tell this ghost was the one named Wrath.A fitting name.The taller man cocked an eyebrow.*You really can't tell?You were definitely awake since a while ago.Wrath?Sloth?Gluttony?* 

"The...seven deadly sins?"James hesitantly proffered up a guess.He was feeling quite overwhelmed, and to be completely honest, he wasn't quite sure he *wasn't* hallucinating.What did all of this even mean?*It means you're stuck with us now.And we're going to help you.* The girl sitting in the middle gave him a bright smile, then batted her eyelashes at him as she lowered her gaze.*I'm Lust, by the way.* 

Wrath rolled his eyes.*Yeah, we come with the property.And normally we're not the type to help people.We're more the "wreaking havoc" type, you feel?* He made air quotes with his translucent fingers.*But you're in luck.Lust wants to help you, and we all owe her a favor.* 

"Help me with what?"The more they talked, the more confused he felt.None of this made any sense.The seven deadly sins?Trying to help him?And they were ghosts?*Not ghosts,* the girl to the left of Lust corrected him.She eyed the cupcake.Oh great.And they could hear his thoughts.Wonderful."What are you helping me with?"he asked again.He didn't know why he was so set on getting an answer.Wrath stepped forward.James tensed as Wrath patted his shoulder.He'd expected to feel something, but...nothing.Just a slight twinge of annoyance that shot through his body.*Everything.* Wrath shook his head and tutted, an expression of mock pity on his face.*Man, you're a mess.*

My mother said the ash fell all at once, waves of dust that covered everything the eye could see.And with it came the darkness.You only got one chance to see the sun on our planet.One, long, continuous day that spanned the majority of your life.Very rarely did you get another chance.She said the flowers wilted first, their petals shrinking into themselves and burrowing into the ground to prepare for a long winter.The longest winter.Then creatures of the day vanished.The kudus, the moorhens, the anoles.They just...left.Replaced by creatures of the night.She still gets nightmares sometimes.She says she can still hear their teeth gnashing outside the window, the soft hissing, accompanied by a wave of stench and rot and decay, filtering through the cracks in the walls.She never says much more than that.I have only ever known the brightness.The warmth of sunlight and its soft, sweet scent, coating my tongue with the taste of orchids and lilies.Adela, my instructor, has begun instructing us about the preparations we must make.Dust masks, oxygen tanks.I tried one on the other day and couldn't stomach it for more than five minutes.The scent of coal fills your nostrils, masking everything else, worming its way into your brain until you can no longer bring up any other scents.It reminded me of the one time when I visited Volaris, diving just a little too far past the reef.I had never before seen giant Quaggas, their streamlined fins leaving pockets of air behind them, that my mother said the children loved to play in before one had been knocked out and drowned.Neither had I seen the blue, tentacled coils, bunched up in hypnotic swirls, beckoning at me.When I got too close, one wrapped itself around my ankle, digging spiny little claws into my skin, pinprick shocks delivered in a random pattern.When I woke up, for months afterwards, any food I ate was laced with pinpricks of pain, like if you'd held a pineapple to your tongue for too long.The salty tang of seawater permeated my senses, each breath I took bringing with it warm bitterness and the whisper of waves crashing in my ears.I couldn't taste the sweetness of the Gorlana fruit for months, its taste masked by the salt.But I hear from Adela that this time will not be the same.There are rumors, I hear her whisper to the other instructors, that the sun will not come back.That we will be stuck in perpetual darkness forever.She says the high council has done nothing to try and stop our sun from being destroyed.I can only think of Ibephris Mountain, which I have not yet had the opportunity to ascend.Of the golden lilies in Rhea Valley, which I have yet to see.Of the butterfly blooms that fill the air with brilliant bursts of color for just one day every hundred years as the butterflies all fly off to Galandria, another planet where they will live and die.There is so much left to explore of this world yet.They won't take it away from me.I won't allow it.

Heather's eyes popped open.She pressed a finger to her forehead, saying a silent spell to ease her migraine.Her dreams were always accompanied by an aura, and yesterday night's left her feeling like a freezing hand had crawled up her back while she was sleeping.She bit her lip.It definitely wasn't a good sign.&nbsp; 

The corridors were eerily empty.Halls that should have been filled with students were devoid of a single living soul.Heather clutched her book bag closer to her chest.What was happening?"Hello?"Her voice echoed through the halls.Her soft-soled boots were nearly silent on the tile floor, but she couldn't help the feeling that she was being watched."Abigail?Cory?"She called out her best friends' names, but there was no reply.It was a bad idea coming to school today.She should've stayed in the dorms.Maybe she had missed a memo about a break or something."Over here!"A voice hissed.She whipped around to see Cory's blonde hair poking out from around a door."Quickly!"Heather dashed towards the classroom.Cory dragged her to the back and pulled her down so they were kneeling behind a line of desks."What's going on?"she whispered."There's a Vexspawn in the building.Everyone's in hiding.Of course you would be late."He tapped her on the forehead a little harder than was necessary.Her eyes widened."Vexspawn?"Her voice rose.He brought a finger to her lips desperately, his gaze whipping about.Then he nodded."Wait, but how did a Vexspawn get in here?I thought they usually frequented woods."They had learned about the creatures in their biology classes, but she'd never thought they'd actually encounter one.Vexspawns were terrifying creatures, not because they had a grotesque body in and of themselves, but because they could take on different forms.Shapeshifters.And no one really knew how to deal with them because their sightings were quite rare.She pulled a dagger out of her boot."What are you doing?"Cory asked, looking at her strangely.He eyed the dagger warily.She shook her head.She didn't know either.She'd done it subconsciously.Her father had taught her how to use dagger when she was younger, and although she hadn't had much need for them after learning magic, she always kept one in each boot.Just in case.A scream sounded, echoing through the hallway.Heather leapt to her feet, but Cory dragged at her arm."We can't just do nothing," she said."We have to go help out!""The teachers will take care of it.We just need to stay safe," Cory hissed."Heather!"Heather froze.Was that...that was Cory's voice.She blinked.But Cory was right next to her."Heather!"the voice called out again.She looked down at Cory, who was sitting there wide-eyed, staring at her.'Vexspawn,' he mouthed.She let him drag her down, more reactively than of her own will.She couldn't hear anything over her heart pounding in her throat.Then a shadow appeared in the doorway.And even with the window blinds closed, with the small amount of light streaming through, she could see him clearly enough through the desk legs she was hiding under.She swallowed.It was Cory.And he was staring not at her, but at the Cory standing next to her.&nbsp; 

"Heather, come here," the Cory in the doorway said, his voice shaky.He extended a hand toward her, but his gaze never left the Cory sitting next to her behind the desks.Heather felt her blood run cold.It was certain now.One of them was the Vexspawn.She backed away from them both, her hands shaking as her gaze whipped between them."Heather, that's the Vexspawn.We have to run," the original Cory said.He turned toward her, his eyes pleading."Let's go call the teachers for help.They'll know what to do.""No!Heather, he's the fake!Come here!"New Cory implored her.She looked from one to the other.How would she know?How would she... *Always aim for the head.* 

Without letting herself think too much, without even thinking really, she drew the daggers from her boots and threw them both.The Cory in the doorway ducked, but the original wasn't so lucky.He stared at her, his eyes wide, as black goo slowly oozed from the dagger embedded into his skull.Then, he collapsed into a pile of bony limbs, his face morphing into a grotesque mask.Cory ran toward her on shaky legs."You nearly killed me!"he said, his voice almost an octave above its usual pitch."Good thing I didn't, right?"Heather said, collapsing to the ground.She looked back up at her best friend."I know you have quicker reflexes than me.I wasn't going to kill you," she said with a small, shaky smile."Good," he said.Just then, the sound of footsteps drew near the classroom.Their headmaster--Madame Cornen--walked into the room."Are you two okay?"she asked, her spectacles almost falling from her face.She pushed them back."Yeah," Heather said, exhaling a large breath."We're fine."Madame Cornen peered over her spectacles at her.Good.Because I have some questions to ask you two about why a Vexspawn was in the school, and why it just happened to be mimicking Cory.You two, my office, now. 

Heather shared a look with Cory.They were known to be troublemakers for sure, but this time, it really wasnt their fault.

"Why are you staring at me like that?"The corner of Mina's eyes crinkled into a smile."If you keep looking, I might just believe you're in love with me."Kaitlyn laughed, her smile bright."How do you know I'm not?"Mina rolled her eyes."I think Freddy would have a problem or two with that," she said jokingly."He might just have to boot you out of our house."Kaitlyn brought her hand to her heart in mock horror, causing Mina to burst into a fit of giggles.She wasn't worried.Her father wouldn't actually boot her out, regardless of the fact that he didn't know she was his daughter.What he did know was that Kaitlyn was Mina's caretaker and that Mina absolutely adored her.Mina had always had a frail body ever since she was young.She'd never go more than a month or so at a time before getting sick, and it took her quite a bit longer than the normal person to recover.So when she was at home, she'd always had a caretaker, but after she'd gotten married to Freddy, he hadn't been able to afford one.So it had seemed like fate when Kaitlyn had appeared on their door one day, willing to be paid less because she said she was a nurse-in-training.And the rest was history.She'd been living with them for almost three years now.And now, she truly felt like part of the family."Kait, I'm gonna go get some groceries from the corner store," Mina yelled from across the kitchen."Wait for me!"Kaitlyn shouted back."Just give me a second, I just have to finish sending this email."She'd been desperately trying to find ways to increase her mother's quality of life for the past few years, but with scientific progress not progressing quickly enough, she'd had to resort to emailing professors and researchers herself to give them hints to speed research along."I'll be fine, it's just across two streets.I'll be back in twenty minutes."Kaitlyn heard the sound of the front door opening and closing.Hurriedly, she typed out the last few lines of the email, then pressed send.Then she grabbed her purse from the kitchen table and rushed out to chase after Mina.She jogged down the street.The store wasn't far, but she'd had a nagging feeling today that something was wrong.And when she reached the corner and turned, she realized why.A crumpled body lay in the middle of the intersection of the street, blood pooling around it.Her mind almost blank, Kaitlyn dashed forwards, praying beyond hope that it wasn't her mother.That it couldn't be her mother.And yet...the long, black hair and delicate features said differently.But her father had never spoken of a car accident, so how was this possible?"Look, I'm so sorry, I didn't see her at all," the truck driver standing next to her said, his face full of terror."Call the ambulance," Kaitlyn said harshly to him before taking off her cardigan and wrapping it under her mother's head.Her mind was strangely calm now.Mina's eyes fluttered open for a second, and she gave Kaitlyn a weak smile."Hi, Kait.""Hi, Mina," she said back gently, brushing a stray strand of hair away from her mother's face."You're going to be okay now."Mina let out a little exhale, a small puff of laughter."Can you let Freddy know I love him?I don't think..." She swallowed."I don't think I'll get the chance to tell him myself again.""No!You will!"Kaitlyn spoke with conviction, her eyes fiery."You're going to survive this."And maybe it was the vehemence of her words, but Mina felt something...strange in that instance.Kaitlyn didn't sound like she was trying to convince herself.She sounded...certain."How do you know?"she asked, even as her consciousness was giving way.She wanted to sleep so badly.There was a pause where Kaitlyn's blue eyes seemed to flash.Then she brought her face down closer until her mouth was right next to Mina's ear."Because I'm your daughter.You can't die here because I'm your daughter."*** 

Mina recovered much faster than doctors had anticipated, and after the incident, she got sick much less often.Freddy called it a miracle, but only Kaitlyn and Mina knew it was more than that.Mina had gained the will to live.It was barely half a year after the accident when Mina got pregnant.Kaitlyn took care of her night and day during the pregnancy, even as she grew more morose with each passing day, even as Mina grew more ecstatic.She never told Mina why she'd come back.That she'd come back because she'd never known her mother...because she had died in childbirth.And when the nine months were up, when Mina's water broke and she was sent to the hospital, Kaitlyn sat in their home, alone, watching the hand on the clock slowly tick.She wouldn't watch her mother die.It was time for her to leave.And so she left without a goodbye.*** 

"Dad, I'm home," she shouted as she stepped through the front door, her heart heavy."Kaitlyn!"her father shouted, "did you get the cake?"Kaitlyn's brows furrowed."What cake?"She dropped her keys on the table.When she'd left, her father hadn't mentioned anything about a cake.Her father appeared in the doorway, much older than the one she was now familiar with, his hair streaked with grey."Silly goose, I knew you would forget it.Lord knows how you keep all that research information straight in your head when you can't even remember to get a cake when that's the only thing I sent you out for."He seemed...unusually excited.In fact, she couldn't remember the last time he'd been so happy."What cake?"she asked again.He rolled his eyes.And the front door clicked just as her father spoke again.She turned around to face the front door, her eyes widening impossibly as she saw who came through."Silly daughter," he said."The cake for your mother's birthday!"

"Hey, how are you doing?"Kane bent down next to the little boy and ruffled his hair.The little boy looked up at him, his eyes wide.He had never seen anyone so tall before.Kane pulled a lollipop out of his pocket."You want it?"The boy nodded, puffing his cheeks out and reaching up for the candy.With a smile, Kane handed it over, then led the boy over to the swings.With short black hair, hazel eyes, and plump cheeks, the boy reminded him of when he was younger.Of the days when he would play on the playground with his parents, and yell, higher, higher, as they pushed him on the swings or down the slide.The days when he still remembered what their faces looked like and didn't have have to rely on photographs smudged from the oil on his fingertips.It had been a long, long time since he had been a child.As he knelt there, spacing out behind the swings--now empty because the boy had run off elsewheres to play--a shadow suddenly fell over him.He looked up and was met with the most radiant smile he had ever seen."I knew it was all a sham.You were so awkward," she said, tucking a strand of her soft, wavy hair behind her ear as she stuck out a hand.He took it, pulling himself up and intimately aware of how warm her palm was.It reminded him of life.Of living."I like you," he blurted out.As if the last three hundred years of experience were nothing but a lie, constructed out of woven strands of fake memories that he hadn't had time to process.She laughed, the sound like a wind chime in winter, melodic and clear."That's good, because I like you too."He felt his heart thump.&nbsp;

*** 

&nbsp;

They started dating, much to Mia's anger and distress.These days, she would simply glare at him, morose.But she never threatened to send him back.Maybe she believed, somehow, that he would still convince Ava he wasn't worth saving.And he would.But...he just wanted a little more time.A little more time away from feeling nothing year after year, and a little more time with the scent of peaches in his arms, with her warm skin against his.They watched French movies and argued about the English subtitles, despite neither of them speaking French.She took him out ice skating and laughed as he fell on his ass multiple times.They talked about the future--so close, just one year until she graduated from her Master's--and about children.They made love.He felt like a plant turned toward the sun.Unable to survive without her, soaking in her warmth.The secret he was hiding felt uglier and uglier by the day.But he didn't know how to bring it up.How to say goodbye.One day, he decided to head to her school to bring her cookies that he had baked himself.They were a little burnt, but he was still proud of them, and he opened the lid to take one last peek as he crossed the road.And then, he was in the air, weightless.Seconds later, he would recall nothing but the sounds of the ambulance and a desperate voice, pleading with him to come back.&nbsp;

***** 

&nbsp;

*You want to bring this man back?* 

*Yes.* 

*You would pay any price?* 

*I would do anything.Please.Only you can help me now.* 

*We can save his life, but there are two conditions.One, his immortality.And two, your life becomes forfeit.You must remain a time traveler and work for us for the rest of your life.Do you accept these conditions?* 

*Yes, I do.* 

*It's okay that he won't remember you at all?It's a necessary part of the procedure.* 

*Anything is fine.Please...just save him.*

The woman's eyes flashed.Her gaze flickered downwards for just a moment before they came up again."Are you sure?"The words came out silky smooth, almost inhuman.Pietra bit her lip, then glanced back towards her friends.Matthew was bent over double with laughter, while Manny waved at her and then shook his fist."Yes," she said."How much will this cost?"The lady smiled."Not much."It was a good thing her father lacked anything but money.She pulled a black credit card from her pocket.The lady shook her head and smiled."Oh no, you'll pay when you reach the destination.""Um..." Pietra leaned closer to the counter."Where am I headed exactly?""You'll know when you get there."And with that cryptic statement, the woman behind the counter pressed a button out of sight, and a small gap in the counter opened up to reveal a thin, rectangular glass box with a ticket inside.She opened it gingerly, then handed it to Pietra, who took it.It had a surprising weight to it, yet the texture wasn't quite right.She brushed over the unrecognizable letters with her finger, the sensation like water sliding over glass.The sense of unease she'd felt up to this moment vanished as soon as she held the ticket in her hands.It centered her.It was almost as if she knew everything would be alright in that moment.She turned back to her friends and waved, giving them a bright smile.Yes.She was ready for the adventure of a lifetime.Maybe she was going to Australia.Maybe to China.But wherever it was, she knew she would be ready for it.Without hesitating, she walked towards the gates.The crowds around her parted like water, the air around her seeming to grow more pure, lighter.She could barely hear the voices of her friend's panicked voices now, telling her to stay, as she walked through security with no luggage.There were no other passengers on the plane.But somehow, that made sense.It was just as it should be.Pietra sighed in relief.The ticket grew hotter in the palm of her hand, but it was a familiar heat.She chose a random seat, gazing at the random rows ahead of her.Then she closed her eyes.***

"Ma'am, we've arrived."A gentle shake on her shoulder.Pietra's eyes slowly drifted open.It was the woman from the airline counter."Where are we?"she asked groggily."3014."Pietra cocked her head to the side."What is that?A country number?"The woman smiled.She gently grabbed ahold of Pietra's wrist and pressed a device to it.Two little mild shocks of pain, almost imperceptible and lightning fast, and Pietra withdrew her wrist.She stared down at the two tiny blue dots on it."It's the year.Your payment is complete.""I don't understand," Pietra said, her brows furrowing in disbelief."The year?And what payment?"The woman smiled back brightly."Yes, it's the year 3014.And your payment of 2 years of your life.That's how we do things here.Trading life for experiences.It promotes highly calculative decision making, and people on average cite a much higher quality of life before they cycle through again."The woman gestured toward the exit door."Welcome, Pietra.I certainly hope you enjoy your stay."

*****

They found the boy in the next alleyway, huddled in a corner, his face dirty with dust and grime.He refused to go with them at first, until they proffered up the lump of cheese.Then, hesitantly, he took Lisas hand.Thank you. The old woman grinned at them as she handed them a gold coin.Keep the bag, youll need it for your coin. She shuffled off a few paces with her grandson in tow before pausing.If youre looking for more money, you should head east towards Harksdale.I hear theyre in need of soldiers and priests. 

Thank you, Kieran yelled at her retreating figure.He glanced up at the sky.It was dusk now, and everything was cast in warm hues of yellows and oranges.They would have to find shelter soon, or risk facing the monsters that came out at dark.He glanced down at the tiny dagger sheathed in his belt.It could barely kill a Hellwing, much less some of the Vexspawns that tended to roam the marketplace at night.They needed to find shelter for the night.There was no way they could reach his cottage without teleportationit was almost twenty miles outso they would have to make do with an inn for tonight.If he wasnt wrong, there was one a couple streets away that was relatively cheap.The crowds were thinning out now, most low level players rushing into buildings for the hour and a half night cycle.Lets find a place to sleep for the night. 

Lisa nodded, her gaze drawn to a little goblin who was rolling around on the ground next to a closed stall.Despite the green, flabby skin that covered his body, it waskind of cute.It continued to roll on the ground, making small squealing noises.She walked closer.Just as she was about to reach it, it suddenly stopped moving, turning its beady eyes on her.Then, it seemed to vibrate, its skin splitting open at the seams to reveal a snakelike creature that crawled out from inside.The snakes tongue flicked as its golden eyes settled on her, its body lazily undulating from side to side.Lisa felt like her feet were nailed to the ground, unable to even scream.Then it lunged.A gust of air blew past her, and before she could process what had happened, the snakes head lay on the ground, even as the rest of its body jerked and twitched within the shell of the goblin body, black blood spilling onto the ground.Kieran wiped his blade on his tunic.Within seconds, the dead creature had faded from existence, and in its place, several coins bounced on the ground several times before they flew into Lisas pouch.That was a Rotling, he said simply, patting his sister on the shoulder.They always do that, so just be careful in the future. 

She snapped out of it and punched him in the shoulder.Ow! 

You should have warned me! 

I told you to be carefu 

How on earth is that warning someone?I nearly had a heart attack! She crossed her arms over her chest, glaring at Kieran as he rubbed the spot where she had hit him.When had she become so strong?Alright, alright.Ill warn you next time.Lets go before worse things appear. Dying wasnt anything new to him, but he didnt *really* want to scar his little sister for life.With quick steps, he took them through the streets, heading toward the wood building with torches out front that had a huge wooden sign with the words VALOR INN painted in red paint on top.Right as they pushed through the door, a beefy man with a huge beard stuck out an arm in front of them.Dye have money fer yer stay? His garlic breath spilled over the duo, and Lisa fought back the urge to gag.As much as she admired her brother for the new technology, right now she wanted to kill him.Kieran slapped two silver coins in his hand.The man grinnedshe thought it was a grin, at least; it was difficult to tell through the scraggly mess of his beardthen slightly bowed his head, and gestured toward the table at the front.The innkeeperll get ye a room. 

Lisa walked up to the table, where a thin, gaunt man with pointed ears and large spectacles was scribbling away at a huge book with a quill.Behind him on the wall were rows of large, metal keys, each hanging on their own nail.She cleared her throat.Were here to get a room for two? 

He barely glanced up at her before reaching back with the hand that wasnt writing and grabbed what seemed to be a random pair of keys.Room 5. His voice was high pitched and reedy.She grabbed the keys from him, noting their heavy weight, and headed toward her brother, who was currently swarmed by various creatures.No wonder it had gotten so loud.She jumped up and down a couple times to peer over the creatures before she saw his spiky black hair.She fought through the crowd, ignoring the sounds of protest as she fought her way to the inner circle, where Kieran was currently speaking to a what could only be a dragoness.When she reached his side and took a good look, she nearly gasped.The dragoness was standing on her hind legs, and though she was completely covered in purple, iridescent scales, she had a beautiful, golden human eyes rimmed with heavy kohl, and her face tapered into a pointy chin.Small horns sprouted from her head, and her nose simply consisted of two slits.Not unlike Voldemort, Lisa thought.Her scaly arms that were currently crossed over her chest extended into claws.A long tail swished behind her.If Lisa tried, she could almost pretend she was human.Who is thisss? 

Her voice was deep and melodic, like it came from the depths of a cavern, the tail of the her sentence ending with a whisper of a hiss.Kieran dragged Lisa closer.Shes my sister. 

The dragoness turned her eyes on her, and they narrowed into thin slits.Then she turned back to Kieran.We had a deal, and you bailed. 

A flicker of annoyance flickered over his face.I told you that someone already gave me that information.It was useless to me.You know I keep my word.Its not like I lose anything by giving you a weapon, but its about the principle of the matter. 

While they argued, Kiera silently pulled up the dragonesss character profile.Species: Dragomir.Level: 197.Wait.Level 197?How long had she been playing this game?Ssso Ill bring you new information for it, deal?  

Kieran shook his head.Sorry, Im doing a run-through right now, which means Im not trading at the moment. 

The dragonesss tail swished angrily.She seemed to want to say something, but finally turned around and threw open the inn doors, disappearing into the night.Several Dragomirs trailed after her.The crowd tightened in a circle again around Kieran, with multiple players vying for his attention, squeezing Lisa out.Looked like he was really a celebrity here.She patted off the dust on her tunic.Suddenly, Lisa felt a tug on her sleeve.She nearly startled when she noticed the green face with long, flowing olive colored hair decorated with flowers.The girls eyes were too large for her face, and she was gazing at Lisa with an expression of awe.Tendrils sprouted from her body at various places.Dryad.Um, my name is Ardisia, the girl proffered.Her voice was soft and bubbly, and she reminded Lisa of a puppy dog.My name is Lisa.Nice to meet you! She resisted the urge to pinch her cheeks.Oh. Ardisia looked flustered.Are we doing real names?Because my in-game name is Ardisia, but my real name is Chloe.Sorry, I thought 

Hey, no worries.Whats up?Did you need something? 

Oh, yeah. She blushed.I heard your brother mention that you guys are doing a run-through.Since you dont have any gear yet, I thought, well, they must be in the beginning, and I dont really have any friends to play with, so I wanted to ask if I could be in your party? 

Lisa glanced over at her brother, who currently seemed to be enjoying the attention and flattery he was getting from the crowd.In fact, every once in a while, uproarious laughter would break out from within the circle, so it seemed he was telling some of his terrible jokes again.She rolled her eyes.Only ten year olds would laugh at them.Regardless, it seemed like he was busy.She turned back toward Ardisia, who was looking at her with large, hopeful eyes.Sure, she said.Were heading for Harksdale tomorrower, tomorrow in game time, you want to join? 

The dryad nodded quickly.Im in room 8!Here, Ill add you really quickly so you can find me She pulled up Lisas character profile, tapping on the request to join party button.Im going to get off now because my mom wants me to wash the dishes, but Ill see you later! Within seconds, she had disappeared.It was always better to have a larger party, right?Lisa snapped, pulling up the party details.It looked like the max number of people you could have was six.Then, glancing at her still busy brother, she headed toward their room.He might have the energy to keep socializing, but she was utterly exhausted.The hallway leading to the rooms was relatively dark, with only a lantern spaced out on the wall between every couple of rooms to provide some brief, flickering light.Just enough for her to see the number five etched into the door.She stuck the key into the lock.It didnt turn.So she tried again.Still nothing.She put all her weight onto the key handle, and it finally clicked.She opened the door and glanced around the room.The game clearly made no bones about making the game as realistic as possible, down to the moth bitten, scratchy looking wool blankets and the sink in the corner of the room that was covered in grime and some unknown gunk.A mouse skittered across the floor.Yuck.Maybe the game was too similar to real life.If they wanted to live in better quarters, clearly they were going to have to kill a couple more monsters.Lisa gingerly laid down on one of the beds.They had finished the first quest, found a new member for their party, and stayed alive.Not bad for a days work.As she lay there, contemplating the next steps for tomorrow, her eyelids slowly began to drift shut.*****

Because when I wrote the first part, I wasn't expecting to write a ton more, so if there's inconsistencies in some of the details, please forgive them!*****

Lisa glared at Kieran from underneath the large headdress with antlers and rosebuds and a thin golden head chain settling on her forehead.Paired with the floor length ball gown that was bedecked with all sorts of jewels, she looked absolutely ridiculous.They were already drawing stares and laughter from a group of orcs nearby, one of who was squealing like a pig.We need to establish some ground rules, she told him.Grabbing his wrist, she dragged him past a stand selling potions and into the alleyway behind it.She kicked a small wooden crate aside, and a single silver coin about the size of a ping pong ball spilled from it, slowly levitating in the air for a moment before floating toward her and disappearing.She snapped her fingers, quickly pulling up her character profile.It hung from the air like a huge, translucent banner.Under gold, it now read ten.Nice.Change me back, she said.Kierans eyebrows raised.Didnt you like dressing up? He snapped his fingers, and she was back to being dressed in simple rags.Lisa rolled her eyes at her clueless big brother.Were not here to play dress up.We have to play this through legitimately.With no cheating.So not even on clothing.And also, I dont need you spoiling whatever plot you already know. 

Alright, I wont.And I barely know anything anyway. He could get behind that.Fair is fair.He had played through as a Tiefling anyway when he was alive, and each race had their own quest trees, so he wouldnt have any spoilers anyway.Is there a life limit to this game? Happy with their agreement, Lisa began to walk back out of the alley.If she wasnt wrong, the initial spawn point was right at the very end of the street.Kieran followed her.No, not really.But you lose half your gold and ten percent of your current levels EXP every time you die.Not terrible, really. When he thought she wasnt looking, he conjured an apple up, rubbed it on his tunic, and took a bite.It was slightly sour, just how he liked it.He happily chewed on it as they strolled past an old, toothless granny selling food.She grinned at him, picking up a small loaf of bread and tossing it at him.He winked back, stuffing it into his mouth.God, her sourdough was the best.Okay, sounds good.Anything else I should know? 

Mmphhe wiped off the juice dribbling down his chin with his sleeveTwo things.First, Im not actually a player in the game.The game wont recognize me as one, so I can do everything with you, but youll have to accept the quests.NPCs can still see me, though.And second, this is really really important.This game is completely open world.Its not a regular MMORPG. He stepped to the side to avoid a fully decked out elf who was barreling straight at him.The elf shot past.There are tons of quest lines, sometimes without a clear order, and its possible to get a bad ending based on the choices you make.Butterfly effect.So just be careful.Even I dont know which ones to choose, and its pretty difficult to tell the NPCs from the real players. 

She nodded, then glanced around.The crowds were beginning to thin out here, and she saw more people in rags like hers.They must be getting close to the beginning.Suddenly, she felt a tug on her sleeve.She glanced to her left, but there was no one there.Then she looked down.Dressed in a large heavy cloak that folded over itself and was clearly too large for her, the old woman peered up at her with wide eyes.Her face was heavily wrinkled, and her eyes were a cloudy grey, as if she had cataracts.She was quite short, almost half Lisas height, and her back seemed to be almost completely bent over.The old woman grabbed at her hand.Darling, can you help me? she croaked.Just a small task, nothing big.I can give you some coin in return. 

Lisa looked back at Kieran, who was currently busying himself with a stall several paces behind.He appeared to be bartering with the tall, ogre-looking creature.Then she glanced down again.Sure, she said.Was this the first quest?The old woman let go of her, clapping her hands together excitedly.Good, good! She pulled out a small cloth bag from her cloak and stuffed it into Lisas hands, along with a small sheet of parchment with a sketch of a small boys face on it.My grandson Liam is out in the marketplace, and I seem to have lost him.Can you find him and bring him to me?He likes cheese and dark spaces. She kindly patted Lisas sleeve.Ill be waiting for you here until the end of the day. 

Alright, clear parameters for a quest.She snapped.Yep, it was listed under the tab QUESTS now.She was definitely on the right track.Kieran! She called out toward her brother, who was still talking with the ogre.He may well be a genius, but he always got easily distracted.Some people never change.With a spring in his step, he headed toward her.You got the first quest? 

She waved the bag of coins at him and handed him the parchment.Right here.We have to find this little boy.Apparently he likes cheese and dark spaces and hes somewhere in the marketplace today.Im assuming that means we buy a block of cheese to lure him out and that hes probably hiding under a stall somewhere? 

Kieran looked at the parchment that she stuffed into his hand.Quickly committing it to memory, he handed it back.Sounds about right.This place is pretty big though, so just be careful not to get lost. They headed back towards the loud din, where all sorts of races swarmed to buy items from the vendors.Kieran glanced up, raising his hand to shield his eyes from the blazing sun that was high in the sky.It was around mid-day.Each day cycle in Harkstone was four hours in real life, so that meant they had around an hour to find the boy before it got dark.He casually kicked over a small barrel that had just spawned next to a stall, and several bronze coins floated into his inventory.He watched as Lisa walked up to the old grannys food stall and purchased a block of cheese from her with the coins in the bag, leaning against the food stall.Have you seen a boy named Liam? he asked her.The old granny raised a wrinkled hand to scratch her ear, opened and closed her mouth several times, then shook her head.He flipped a bronze coin into the air, and she caught it with surprising dexterity.Thanks. 

Lisa frowned.Isnt that bribery? 

Kieran simply grinned at her.Norma and I have a mutual understanding.  

Whatever.You take the left side, Ill take the right. 

So they went, pulling up all the cloth covers each stall.Although there were a couple of elves that stared at them strangely, and a druid who refused to move from in front of a stall, most of the sellers looked at their actions with indifference.That was a good sign, Kieran thought.It meant other players had done the same thing.By half an hour, he could already feel his back aching from bending over and standing up straight over and over again.He leaned against a weapons stall, watching as his sister continued to peer under the stalls on her side as the sweat dripped down her brow.He had to admit he was proud of what he had accomplished.The VR pods could not only track heart rate and minute facial expressions, but the suit that came with the pod could mimic sensations and physiological reactions as well.So they were both feeling the hot summer heat beat down on them because the pod was blasting them with hot air.Lisa wiped the sweat off her forehead, gingerly standing up straight despite her backs protests.There was still a long ways to go.Kieran wasnt kidding about the length of this marketplace.And if they didnt find Liam soonshe peered into the cloth bag that now held the block of cheesethe cheese was going to melt into a gooey mess.She glanced over at her brother, who was similarly hiding in the shade on the other side of the street, panting.Maybe its not just stalls? she shouted at him over a goblin next to her, bargaining for a cheaper price on a Drexel Blade.He shrugged, fanning his face with his hand desperately.When had he been forced to suffer like this?He had always just been able to conjure up an anti-heat suit.This was killing him.Lisas gaze settled behind him, watching as an overweight halfling waddled into a side street.Then her eyes lit up, and she sprinted over, slapping Kieran on the shoulder.Alleyways.We forgot to search those. 

He groaned.Lisa rolled her eyes.Her brother had spent his entire life cooped up in his room coding, so it made sense that he would have terrible endurance, but it was now that she truly appreciated the years of swimming she had done.Come on, she said, dragging him away from the wooden post.Its just a couple, itll be nothing. Wasnt he the one who was acting all cocky and confident earlier?There was nothing in the first three alleyways they checked.Just as she peered into the fourth, she noticed a couple of dark shadows further in.The shadows were tall, almost impossibly so, and despite the fact that there was almost no light, she could see the shadows of long tails.Curious, she took a step forward.And was promptly met with a hand covering her mouth.She nearly protested when Kieran shoved the both of them behind a stack of barrels, until she saw the serious expression on his face.He was staring at the shadows with an intensity she had never seen before.They crouched there, waiting for what, she wasnt sure.She watched as he brought out a small mouse from his tunic, setting it on the ground.It skittered toward the shadows.Kieran then pulled out a pair of earpieces.He stuck one in his ear, glaring at her as she stole the other from him.*When is the handoff happening?* A voice hissed, and the voice nearly made her shudder.It sounded like it came from the depths of hell itself.*Noon, tomorrow.Two hundred pounds.*

*Tell Gnornen that Ill be waiting for him in the old place.*  

She tried to peer at them through the cracks of the barrels, but they had disappeared.They logged off. Kierans voice sounded strangely toneless as he said this.He grabbed the mouse that had skittered back, tucking it back into the pocket of his tunic, and then he took the earpiece from her, putting those away as well.Who were they?And why are you acting like this? 

He simply glanced at her for a second before patting her on the shoulder and getting up.Come on, lets go find Liam. 

***** 

The chapters for this are turning out a bit longer than expected, so I'll probably need a little longer to upload each part!One thing I just realized after writing is that I kind of shift POVs throughout.Is that really distracting for anyone?I'll separate the POV's into scenes if it's really distracting.

"You know you weren't supposed to get out, right?"Tucker glared at the five of them, his arms crossed over his chest."The entire point was to land in jail.""Is it our fault they're too slow?"Cristian asked, slinging the small sack of diamonds over his shoulder."I slowed down for them, but the guy chasing me ran out of breath in five minutes flat and was wheezing.I think he got a heart attack."He was the shortest and slowest of the bunch, and would have been the easiest to catch.The others murmured their agreement."And what's your excuse then, Shawn?"Tucker whipped around, setting his sights on the "tech-savvy" member of the group.Shawn simply shrugged, slowly removing his black gloves."They never checked the restroom."He sniffed."I thought they always checked the restroom.At least in all the heists movies I've seen.I just came out through the air vent.Also," he turned and glared at Dylan, "I know you left that giant baseball bat in there.I nearly didn't make it out.I dented the air vent so badly, I'm pretty sure they'll have to get the entire section replaced.""Well, I wanted to help," Dylan said.He chuckled, running a hand through his sandy hair."I was shocked when you came out and actually met us by the van."Then he snorted."It was so conspicuous too.A giant white van just across the street.My nana has better vision than them.""You weren't here to show them up or prove how much better you are than them!"Tucker finally exploded.He grabbed the baseball bat from the table behind him and slammed it against the metal surface.The deafening clang reverberated through the room, causing Alvin to clap his hands against his ears.It successfully shut the members of the crew up."You were supposed to get caught!How are we supposed to win a game if--" 

"Why are you so set on winning anyways?"Shawn asked.His blue eyes were piercing as he gazed at Tucker, an eyebrow half-raised."Because...because.Just because.It's a matter of pride," he finally spit out.To be honest, he wasn't quite sure either.It *was* a matter of pride, no doubt, but it wasn't like he was going to send these players to the Major Leagues.So what--

A small sack of diamonds appeared in front of his eyes.Christian met Tucker's eyes head on."You were the brains of the operation.We're clearly all cut out for this.You wanna waste your life trying to pull a team together that'll never make it beyond those prison walls, or you wanna make some money?"Tucker was silent for a moment.Then he reached out and took the bag.

Kyra's hand snapped back.She narrowed her eyes at Damien, her wingtips fluttering slightly as she set down the spoon.Damien smiled back blandly, his fangs glistening slightly as he adjusted the spoon slightly, his fingers just barely brushing against hers.The faint aroma on her skin called out to him, tempting him to simply grab her and bring his lips to the soft, porcelain flesh of her neck.There was always a cool, tingling sensation associated with drinking fairy blood, almost like mint.And the aftertaste was simply exquisite, lingering in the mouth for days.But Kyra had always been a wily one, and she wouldn't be easy to win over."So what brings you around, Damien?You didn't give me much time to prepare."The reproach in her voice was obvious as she brought back another dish from the kitchen and set it down in front of him.Her own dish consisted merely of various fruits and herbs she'd foraged earlier.Her large eyes met his for a split second before she turned her gaze away.Damien wasn't surprised.She knew better than to meet a vampire's gaze for longer than a moment.It was how they hunted after all."Oh, you know.Just haven't visited my good friend for a while, so I thought I'd drop by."He took in a deep breath.The dish on the table smelled...interesting.More interesting than even Kyra."What's for dinner tonight?""Well, I didn't have time to go out and find a boar, which I know is usually your favorite, so you'll just have to make do."Kyra shrugged and opened the lid.The aroma wafted out, along with the scene of an almost raw chunk of flesh, blood oozing out.Damien's fangs began to tingle.Whatever it was, it was fresh meat.He might've been here for Kyra, but he could certainly eat beforehand.Without hesitating, he grabbed a chunk and dug his fangs into the sinewy flesh.The taste was...strangely familiar.A wisp of a memory of something he'd tasted long ago.And it was delicious.When he'd satiated the initial cravings of hunger, he finally set the large piece of meat down, bringing the tablecloth his lips and wiping away the blood that covered his hands."That was delicious, Kyra."Kyra nodded, slowly chewing away at her own veggies."Thank you.I definitely wasn't expecting guests.I haven't had anyone over since Idris.""Well, it was quite good."Damien's lips began to tingle.Then his brows furrowed."Wait, Idris?I haven't seen him since two weeks ago.He hasn't come back to the coven for our weekly meetings.When'd you have dinner with him?"Kyra blinked her large eyes several times, her head cocking slightly to the side."Around two weeks ago?"The tingling sensation grew stronger."That's so strange.I wonder if he decided to join another coven."Theirs wasn't a strict one.Vampires were free to come and go as they chose.It was better that way for them as well, having connections."Damien licked his lips.He was suddenly feeling quite parched.His gaze turned toward Kyra's neck."What were we having, by the way?"His head began to pound.It was so strange.He'd never had hunger cravings right after eating."Oh, you mean what you had.I filled up on him way earlier in the day, so I wasn't really hungry."Damien felt like his brain was working through a cloud of fog.He looked at Kyra, who was still sipping her tea."Fairies don't eat meat."Then his blood ran cold."What do you mean 'him'?"His breathing grew faster and faster, almost uncontrollably.Kyra smiled at him, a dimple showing up on her right cheek."Oh, silly Damien.Fairies only *choose* not to eat meat.But I've renounced my vows ages ago.Why did you think I liked making friends with vampires?It certainly wasn't because I had an interest in being eaten."She threw back her head and laughed, a sound like tinkling bells.But Damien could only sense foreboding in the beautiful laugh.There was something wrong now.He was almost certain of it.But his muscles were tight, almost impossibly so.Try as he might, he suddenly found himself unable to move.Kyra sighed in contentment."Didn't I say what we were having for dinner?Well, no matter. She walked up to him and tapped him on the nose with her index finger and giving him a broad smile.You're so cute.I could eat you right up.

*****

A searing pain swept up her right arm, and Lisa bit back the urge to yell.She opened her eyes, clapping a hand to her arm.It came away sticky.She opened up her pouch and grabbed the red, translucent marbleit didnt look like any health potion shed ever seen before, but Kieran had assured her it wasand popped it into her mouth.She felt the pain in her arm begin to recede.Gingerly, she tested it, moving it up and down.Okay, nothing seemed broken.She picked herself off the ground.Ardissia! 

Nothing, except the call of birds.She tried again, and this time, a rat scurried out from a leaf next to her foot, causing her to jump.She could hear her heart pounding in her ears.To her right was a dark forest, one you might expect to see in a horror film.At the tree-line, gnarled trees twisting together at the roots and branches, with thick vines sprouting out of the ground, strangling the forest floor.A singular area lay relatively bare, in the shape of an oval, just a couple feet away from her, almost like an entrance.She took a few steps away from the tree-line.Like the portal, only this one gave off creepier vibes.To her left, a large sea of golden wheat that stretched toward the sky, almost seven feet high, like something out of Van Goghs painting.And with the small dirt road going through it to match.It was a clear path.She hesitated.Was it too clear?Maybe the test was to pick the one that looked scarier.She really wished Kieran were here now.He would know what to do.She felt a bit of the little girl shed been return, from when Kieran had still been alive.He had always taken care of any problems, including that one time she got bullied by several girls in her school and he had revealed all their nasty acts to the school board.They had gotten suspended after.It had only been after he left that she had grown a little more independent.She shook her head.It was useless to deal in hypotheticals now.It was going to get dark soon.The sun rested against the horizon, dipping lower and lower with each minute.She would have to get going; this didnt seem like an ideal place to be when night fell.She shivered.She could just imagine the monsters that would appear.And besides, there was probably some NPC she needed to find in order to start the quest.With a glance backwards at the tree-line, she sprinted toward the wheat field.&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

What do you mean theres no quest in this castle? Kieran resisted the urge to shake the bearded guard by his shoulders.The guard simply continued to keep eyes his straight forward as he stood guard by the castle gates, his back straight.Sorry sir, there are currently no quests available in the castle. 

Then, he turned to Kieran, his unscarred eye taking in the elfs appearance.Although we are looking for more soldiers.If youre interested, you should report to the barracks. He raised an armored arm and pointed toward the side of the castle, the iron creaking as he moved.Kieran drew his blade and pressed it against the guards throat.The blade was called the Lunar Blade, aptly named for its edge that was curved like a new moon.He had spent a pretty penny on it, and its razor sharp edge pierced slightly into the guards skin, drawing a thin line of blood to the surface.I know there was a group of players who were let in, he murmured.I could kill you permanently.

The NPCs around them began staring, and some players had stopped doing what they were doing as well.Kieran had altered his appearance, going back to the spiky black hair and hazel eyes that were his own in real life, but it was easy enough to pull up his profile and see the question marks that came to represent his existence as the Digital Phantom.Sorry, sir, there are no quests available in the castle. He didnt react to Kierans threat.Or maybe he hadnt been programmed to.Kieran growled, then sheathed his blade.Come on, he grunted.Baduk, who had been talking to some of the players, came running back, his bag of coins jingling.He had to jog to keep up with Kierans fast walk.Stopstop He huffed and puffed through the words.Kieran stopped.Sorry, forgot. 

Baduk bent over, his hands on his knees.No, noitsalright. He raised a hand and waved.He took another couple of deep breaths, then stood up.I hope youre happy.I spent a lot of gold trying to pry that information out of peoples mouths. He rolled his eyes.Everyones so capitalistic these days. 

When he saw Kierans impatient gaze, he cleared his throat.There was definitely a quest.The guards went out into the streets and brought people into the castle. 

Thats really strange then.How would the guard not know about it? 

Suddenly, Baduk got a funny expression on his face.What? Kieran asked.Wellits not for sure.Its just rumors.But the Harkstone forums have been buzzing about secret quests.The devs claim they dont know anything about them, and only a couple of people have come forward with some late game weapons they shouldnt have. 

Why havent I heard about this? 

I guess people didnt think it was important enough to try and trade for it. 

Kieran felt like cursing.If he hadnt been so adamant about trading, if he had just made friends with more players, maybe hed have learned about it sooner.Wait.But they took quite a few people, right?Shouldnt there be a ton of people coming forward to talk about it? 

I dont know.Maybe people wanted to keep it a secret?Maybe they didnt know it was special in the first place?I mean, its hard to keep a secret when youre kidnapping people in broad daylight, but still

Kieran was silent for a moment.Then he said, Lets wait here at the castle for them and see if they come out within a couple days.If they dont, lets go find one of the players who talked on the forum. 

Sure. They began to walk, when Baduk stopped.Actually, you stay here.Im going to go back and lock my door.Ill meet up with you in a bit. Within seconds, he had disappeared down the cobblestone streets.Kieran found a fountain in front of the castle with a good view of the front gate and sat on the smooth, stone edge.He pulled up the map and tapped on the grey dot.Last online: 56 minutes ago.Lisa, where are you?&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

*An error occurred.Please try again later.*

Lisa frowned.She tapped on the send button again.*An error occurred.Please try again later.*

It didnt make sense.If she could connect to the server, then why couldnt she send a message out?What was strange, too, was that the map showing all of Harkstone was now empty, with only a pulsing question mark in the middle of the interface.That knowledge, she had to admit, sent chills down her spine.It was almost completely dark out now, and she had to rely on the soft glow of the character interface that she kept open by her side to see where she was going.It hung like a translucent blue banner in front of her.In spite of her situation, she wanted to laugh.She was actually quite resourceful when things came down to it.Suddenly, she stopped and squinted into the distance.Was that?Lisa sped up, going from a walk to a jog as the two small specks of light in the distance became more clear.Two torches, lighting up what appeared to be enormous hedges ten feet tall.It was a miracle she hadnt seen them before, towering over even the gargantuan wheat.In fact, now that she thought about it, everything here seemed just a bit too big.As she drew near, she slowed to a stop.Right next to one of the torches, there stood a little girl glancing around her, as if she were looking for someone.Logically, Lisa knew she had no reason to be scared since it was just a game, and in Harkstone you couldnt even permanently die.But unease had pervaded her senses ever since shed dropped down in this placenot helped by the strange situation with the map and the communication issuesthat caused her to hesitate.Lisa took a deep breath and walked toward the girl.She was dressed in a blue smock, with her hair up in pigtails, and had on high lace stockings.When she saw Lisa, she darted up to her, her eyes wide.I lost my basket in the maze!Can you help me? 

Lisa glanced at the maze in question.Who knew what mysteries lay behind those tall hedges?But if she didnt complete the quest, could she get out?Have you seen anyone else? 

I dont know, but can you help me?There are monsters in the maze, and Ive lost my basket! 

Lisas hand went to the dagger at her waist.Not that it would do much against monsters other than a Banebug.But grasping the cool handle in her hand made her feel better nonetheless.Do you have any hints? She remembered Kieran mentioning sometimes the harder quests providing small clues.Dont think too hard.Its in between!Just follow the yellow brick road. 

What kind of a hint was that?Did this girl think she was from Kansas?Lisa closed her eyes and sighed.Regardless of how useless the hint seemed, it looked like that was all she was going to get.Yeah, Ill help you. 

A small ding, and the quest appeared in the tab.Okay.That was something at least.The girl smiled.Remember, follow the yellow brick road! Then she skipped over to her post by the torch once again and began looking around again, returning to her idle animation.All she was needed now was a little, black Cairn Terrier by her side, and she could definitely pass for Dorothy.Well, this was it.If she died here, at least she would transported back to outside the quest, so there wasnt a lot to lose.She still didnt relish the idea of being eaten or torn apart by a monster though.Just thinking about the pain

She shivered.But the maze part was simple enough.Right-hand rule.So with a glance back at the sea of wheat that shed left behind, she walked into the maze, careful to keep her hand firmly planted to the right side.&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It was the silence.When Lisa had been out in the wheat fields, at least the sound of crows cawing and crickets chirping had kept her company.But here, once she had left the crackling fire of the torches behind, there was nothing.She winced at each breath she took, and each footfall sounded like that of a giants.She moved slowly by the light of her character interface.The stony ground was uneven in places, and she had nearly tripped more than once.Suddenly, she froze.From her right, she could clearly hear the sound of something heavy dragging against the ground.Then a long groan, so deep and low that the sound reverberated through the ground, making the small pebbles by her feet dance.She whipped around without moving her feet, her hand clapped over her mouth.Her eyes desperately scanned the darkness.It sounded like it was coming to her left.And what on earth was it?It sounded like it was the size of a small car.But she couldnt just stand here.Shed be a sitting duck.So with a gaze up toward the heavens and a prayer, she began moving again, only this time more furtively, barely raising her foot an inch above the ground with each step she took.The groaning continued.She kept her hand to the wall, barely grazing the leaves, moving as quickly and silently as she could.She had closed the interface, so now she only had the dim light of the stars and the tiniest sliver of the crescent moon to work by.Shadows lurked in every corner.She would hold her breath as she passed them, praying there was nothing in the darkness.The creature grew closer.Her mind worked frantically.Was it dragging its leg?A club?A human body?Whatever it was was now close enough that she could hear each exhale of its breath, sudden puffs of air she could feel at the heels of at her feet, and close enough that she could hear the groaning.Oh, that awful groaning and gurgling, like it came from a set of lungs that had been pulverized twice over then stuffed back into the body.A shrill screech rent the air, just a couple feet behind her.Lisa bolted, her feet carrying her faster than shed ever thought possible.Stray twigs sticking out of the hedge walls slapped at her face and arms, but she barely felt them.She didnt slow down, even when she crashed straight into one of the walls and came back reeling.She stumbled onwards, blindly running.Her lungs burned, and her ankle ached.She turned a corner and bumped into a knot of branches and leaves.She felt her way along them, her eyes desperately looking into the darkness for an exit.*No.No no no no no.*

*NO.*

She turned around, her back pressed against the twigs and branches that mercilessly dug into her skin.She could hear the creature now, the sound of its screeching just one row of hedges away.The sliver of moon disappeared.Lisa felt the energy drain out of her body.She couldnt see it clearly, but she could make out the shape of its large bulbous body as it reared its head, and the rows upon rows of tiny scissor-like fangs in its mouth.Or what appeared to be its mouth, since it was the only feature that was differentiable from the rest of its oozing pile of body mass.It wasnt a club it was dragging, she thought weakly as it dragged itself up to its full height, almost as high as the hedges themselves.No, the giant man-eating worm was dragging its own *body*.She nearly gagged.Its putrid scent reeked of rotting meat and sulfur, and as it turned its head to face her, she thought she might actually faint.Hysterically, she thought of the Rotling and wondered if this might be its great, great grandmother.Or perhaps a distant relative who a mad scientist had performed an experiment on, and now it was avowing its revenge on humanity.As if it had heard her theory, it screeched again, a shrill sound that could have been heard for miles around.*Oh good*, Lisa thought weakly.*Maybe its calling its friends for supper.*

"Sarah, you know mother said to get home by nine," Marnie hissed to her little sister.She glanced around nervously at the lampposts that had begun to flicker.Government curfew was set at 9:15pm, and those who got caught out past it often weren't heard from again."I know, I know!"Sarah yanked at her necklace, which had gotten stuck between the chain links of the fence."Help me!"she pleaded.Marnie pressed her lips together but raced back toward her sister, desperately trying to untangle the thin metal from the chain."Move your head, I can't see," she said.She shoved at Sarah's head so she wasn't blocking the light of the lamppost a little ways to their left.She carefully untangled the chain, loop by loop."How did you even get this stuck anyways?""Maybe if you would've helped me, I wouldn't have struggled so hard," Sarah complained, wrinkling her button nose.She rolled her eyes at her big sister.They were always arguing like this.In fact, Marnie was hard-pressed to remember a time when she wasn't griping about cleaning after Sarah's messes.And Sarah made a lot of messes."Hurry up," Sarah said."Shut up."A couple more loops and it would be free."Marnie.""..."

"Marnie!""What?"Marnie finally snapped, taking her eyes off the necklace that somehow seemed to be getting more tangled by the moment.She paused upon seeing the wide-eyed terror on Sarah's face as she stared at a point beyond the fence, towards the woods.A chill ran down her spine.Without hesitating, her gaze snapped back toward the necklace, and her fingers worked with renewed vigor.They were no longer working against the government deadline."The fog," Sarah choked out.Marnie yanked at the necklace, which pressed against Sarah's neck.Why had the government insisted on using necklaces for identification purposes?They didn't have a clasp.Sarah coughed.Marnie barely glanced back up at the white mist that slowly crept toward them, almost as if it was grabbing at the blades of grass on the ground."Marnie, you have to go."A note of fear was beginning to creep into Sarah's voice.Marnie steadfastly ignored the way Sarah pushed at her.She could untangle the necklace.She could.She couldn't remember--didn't know--why they feared the fog.Why everyone did.All she knew was that the government curfew came earlier and earlier every year because the fog crept upon the city earlier and earlier.It was gone by morning, but lingered permanently in places.No one walked into it.Even when looking at it, there was some vague sense of unease.Marnie always felt, while gazing upon it, like she had heard the ending of some story but didn't have the plot.A nagging feeling that she was forgetting something.Something important."Marnie, please!"Sarah begged."Leave me!""No!"Marnie yelled, glaring at her.Somehow, she knew.If she left her here, she would never see Sarah again.She took in the frightened look on her sister's face, the sharp freckles against paleness of her cheeks.If she left her here, she would never see her again.She didn't know how she knew, but she knew.She knew.The fog had reached the fence now, almost."Are you ready?"she asked Sarah, doing her utmost to keep the tremor from her own voice.Sarah's lips trembled.She exhaled a shaky breath as a coolness began to settle into her calves."Stay with me, Marnie," she said.No matter what she said, Marnie wouldn't leave.In that case, she might as well be selfish and beg her to stay."I will," Marnie whispered, watching the fog creep past her sister's legs, watching as it spiraled upwards.Watched as it crept towards her.She shut her eyes, her hands desperately clinging to Sarah's.Moments later, they disappeared into the fog together.

"No, that's impossible," Johnson murmured to himself, his gaze flicking over the different screens as his fingers flew over the keypad.He ran the numbers again.His brow furrowed.It didn't add up.He'd sped up the simulation by a factor of five, but there was no way it would've progressed rapidly enough to allow for technology robust enough to travel that quickly.He'd simply gone out for lunch.He blinked several times.67 minutes.He'd been gone for a mere 67 minutes.He dug back down into the logs, scrolling through the last five minutes.The satellite had only been created in the last three minutes or so.Sent out exactly two minutes and fifty four seconds ago.He ran the calculations in his head.They'd only sent out Voyager 1 in 1977, and it had left their own solar system in 2013.Almost thirty years.But this universe, this solar system, was only a couple hundred of years old.Civilization had only started a mere 142 minutes ago.That's why he'd thought it would be okay to leave.Because at that stage, the most intelligent species were akin to apes, just learning how to use tools.So what changed?Johnson leaned back in his chair, the skin on his arms prickling with goosebumps.This civilization had progressed at almost a hundred times that of humanity in terms of technology.And if it did then, what did that mean for their real universe, infinitely vast with infinite solar systems?Johnson shook his head, chuckling.This was no time to worry about that.He shut his eyes, massaging his temples.Staring at the code too long had messed with his sanity.Aliens.It wasn't something he had worried about for the last 46 years of his life, and he wasn't about to start now.He glanced back at the screen.Then froze.How could he have missed it earlier?&nbsp;

*Time: 13:35:33* 

*Planet: 2A463R* 

*Event: Satellite named Crown originating from city of Klorn, Ascad has left the planet moving at 60,000 miles per second.* 

&nbsp; 

Another planet.With another satellite, moving at a third of light speed.Johnson gulped, scrolling down.The time of the crash was 14:42:24.But besides than the other satellite leaving later from planet 84ABR, there were no other relevant logs related to outer space travel.He ran the numbers, calculating the distance from 2A463R to the edge of the solar system, his foot tapping furiously on the tile floor.He stopped, his head jerking up.The dark reflection of himself--his disheveled hair and shadow of a beard--on the turned off monitor loomed back back him, showing him his own stricken expression.The first satellite was traveling fast enough to leave the solar system before the crash.So where had it gone?

Marnie slowly made her way through the Walmart, sliding a finger along the shelves.She sighed, picking up a can of sunscreen and watching as it began to shimmer before it faded to nothing.Things had been like this ever since the accident.She had watched family pictures crumble to dust upon touching them, had cried gallons and gallons of tears over losing her family even though she could still see them.She had watched them bury an empty casket.But then, sometime a year or two ago, everything had stopped mattering.Maybe it was that she could no longer interact with the world in a meaningful way.She had grown sick of her mother recoiling in fear every time Marnie touched her face, and she had grown sick of the way her dog, Juno, growled at her, his eyes seeing straight through her whenever she tried to pet his fur.There was nothing left for her here.Yet she couldn't even die.Someone bumped into her, and she crashed into the shelf."Watch it!"she snarled, whipping around.Even though she knew they couldn't see her, she still couldn't help the resentment that bubbled up.The girl, with brown hair and dark brown eyes that looked too old for her age, stared at her.Marnie froze, then stepped to the side.The girl's gaze followed."You can see me?"Marnie croaked.Her voice...she hadn't used it in over a year now.It sounded foreign to her ears.Raspy.The girl slowly nodded.Marnie felt her eyes prick with tears.She walked up to the girl, taking her hands in sheer ecstasy."You're invisible too?"The girl slowly nodded her head and clasped her hands over Marnie's, rubbing them gently.Marnie gripped onto her hands more tightly.The only thing she'd felt ever since the accident was cold.Not even fire could warm her up.It was first time she'd felt warmth in a long, long time, and she clung to it desperately."Do you know why you're invisible?"the girl asked.She cocked her head to the side, and Marnie noticed at she had a slightly shimmery quality to her."No, I...I don't know.I've never met anyone who could see me before, and I'm just so unbelievably happy to see you.I can't even begin to--"

"Stop."The girl raised a hand to Marnie's lips."I would love to stand here and talk further, but we really can't.So let me just give you the shortest explanation possible."She looked somewhere past Marnie before her gaze snapped back to Marnie's."The multiverse is real, and you're in the wrong parallel universe.That's why no one can see you.Because you're not meant to be here.I'm here to bring you back.But we have to hurry because you're running out of time.We're all running out of time."&nbsp;

&nbsp;

"What do you mean?"Marnie didn't know whether to laugh or to cry."Just come with me.I'll show you," the girl said.Then she dragged Marnie away from the aisles, looking back every so often.Marnie glanced behind her, but there was nothing there."What are you looking for?"she asked.The girl's expression was serious."Monsters," she said.Marnie wasn't really sure how to reply to that one--in fact, she couldn't even be sure whether the girl was entirely serious or not--so she shut her mouth and followed the girl as the she was dragged through the grey streets.That was one thing that Marnie had noticed changing in the past year.The sky seemed to get more grey every month, and just in the last month or so, white flakes had started falling, only it wasn't snow.They came like storms, covering the ground, and although scientists didn't really know what they were made of, they hadn't seemed to be causing harm at least.Parents had even begun to let their children play around in the strange material."My name's Lilith," the girl said as they wound they way through the alleyways."Hurry, we have to go find the others.""Others?"Marnie's heart soared.The girl nodded, racing along the streets so quickly that Marnie could've sworn they would've been hit by multiple cars by now had the girl not dragged her out of the way a split second before each time."Four others.All stuck here, like us."And then the girl stopped, having reached a playground.Four teenagers, all around sixteen or seventeen, were swinging on the swings.Two boys, two girls.They all stopped at Lilith's arrival and jumped off the swings, running toward her."Lilith!You're back!"A girl with a skinny frame and dark glasses shot toward Lilith, swallowing her in an embrace."We were worried about you."The brown haired boy, who arrived next, said.He glanced toward Marnie briefly."You brought her."Then he turned toward Marnie and extended his hand, his green eyes piercing as he scrutinized her, making her self conscious about her appearance.All of a sudden, she realized that she had been dressed in the same baggy sweatshirt and jeans for the last year."I'm Kayn."She took his hand."I'm Marnie.""We know," the last girl said.She looked younger than the others, and her eyes had a strange hollowness to them that made Marnie nervous.She seemed to be peering into Marnie's soul."I'm Anna.""Okay," Lilith said."We have our last member.Let's go find Mr.Hyde.""Who's Mr.Hyde?"Marnie asked."He's the only one who can see us," Lilith explained."And he's the only one who can help us get back to our own worlds."Ever since she was young, Marnie was curious.Her father knew it, her mother knew it, and even she knew that the degree of her curiosity was unhealthy.But she couldn't help it.Marnie took a deep breath and held her ground against Lilith, who was trying to drag her."Wait, you guys have to tell me what's going on.I'm really grateful that I found you guys.Truly.But I can't just follow you without knowing exactly what you're dragging me into."The girl named Anna rolled her eyes and crossed her hands over her chest."Recalcitrant," she spitted out.Lilith frowned, but took a deep breath and began speaking rapidly, so quickly that Marnie almost couldn't understand her."This world is disintegrating.This stuff?"She stuck out her hand and let a couple of the white flakes that that were currently drifting down land on her palm."It's stardust.It's the matter of this universe falling apart.And it's because we're not meant to be here.Not just that."Lilith paused."Haven't you noticed you've been aging backwards?You're younger than you were when you got here.Everyone is.Anna was older than all of us.Marnie."Lilith grabbed Marnie's arms and forced her to meet her eyes."Anna was 37 when she got here two weeks ago.*Now she's barely fifteen.* And her aging process is only reversing faster and faster.""What?Wait, how is that possible?"Marnie's eyes darted to Anna.No matter she'd seemed strange."How...how is Mr. Hyde supposed to help us even?""He was the physicist who realized that there were six of us here who weren't supposed to be.Six blips in the radar.I met him purely by accident a month ago, and I've been searching for everyone else ever since.*Please, Marnie.* I'll let him explain once we get there, but we have to go.Anna has only around a week before she's gone forever."Marnie, finally realizing the true severity of the situation, nodded numbly."Lead the way."***

"Get out get out get out get out," Emma muttered under her breath as she walked as quickly as she could towards her car, the bookmark of the four-leaf clover clutched tightly in one hand, the other hand tightly clutching her purse.She glanced down the darkened alleyway, her knuckles turning white.She never took this route usually, but desperate times called for desperate measures, and she would rather take the risk of meeting some unsavory people over getting cursed for the rest of her life.The sound of water dripping down the pipes filled her ears, and she bit her lip, trying to keep the clacking sound of her heels on the cobblestone as silent as possible--an almost impossible task.Her shoulder was suddenly jerked back by a hand, and she was faced with a pair of narrowed eyes and a sneer.By the dim light of the crescent moon that barely peeked down into the shadows between the two tall buildings, she could see the glint of a blade in his hand."Hello, pretty lady.How would you like to give me some cash?"The man leered at her, licking his cracked lips.She took a step back, her hand on her purse, and considered her options.She could run, but she wasn't going to get far over the uneven ground, and even if she could, the cats were pouring in from that side of the city.She couldn't risk it.She had to move forward."You going to do it or not?"He stepped toward her again, the tatters of clothing on his back waving back and forth with his movement, making him seem more monstrous.He circled her, cornering her until her back was pressed up against the brick wall of the building."Haven't you heard the news?Someone's dropped 200 black cats in the city.You should be escaping!"she blurted out.Maybe he would panic and leave.The man threw his head back and laughed."My luck ain't gonna get any worse than this.I don't mind black cats.They make good company.You, on the other hand..." He reached forward.She stood completely still, her fingertips trembling, as his grimy fingers covered in callouses caressed her cheek."You can keep me company tonight, honey," he said, and thrust his pelvis forward into her leg.She almost puked.Desperately, she fumbled with her bag, but it turned over, and the contents spilled over the floor.She slid down the wall and tried to grab her cellphone, but the man laid a foot over it."That's a no no."She was going to die here.She was actually going to die here.She desperately clawed at the ground for anything she could find, her hand coming into contact with a glass case that somehow hadn't smashed when it hit the floor.Dimly, in the back of her mind, she realized that it had landed on her four-leaf clover bookmark.He was bending over her.Uncapping the bottle, she sprayed it into his face, and he stumbled backwards, gagging and hacking, wiping at his eyes with one hand while cursing her out with the other.The scent of perfume filled the air, enough to make her want to retch.She slowly got to her feet, her legs still trembling, and tried to run, but fell back down again.It felt like all the energy had left from her body."I'll get you now, you stupid bitch," the man sneered.But just as he reached down for her, his eyes widened, and the knife dropped from his hands.He sucked in a breath, then another.And then it happened.He sneezed.He glanced around wildly, but there was no one in sight.So he turned to her, falling to his knees and grasping at her shoulders with his hands."Bless me," he begged.She didn't say anything, simply watched as smoke began to curl upwards from his body.His soul would be gone in minutes."Bless me!"he shouted, shaking her back and forth."Bless me!"She kept her mouth shut.Seeing she wasn't about to help, he muttered to himself desperately, "God bless me.God bless me.God bless me."He began to convulse, his eyes rolling upwards in his head, falling to the floor.And then, after what seemed like a century, he finally stopped moving, thin tendrils of smoke-like substance escaping his corpse.Emma scrabbled around, gathered everything on the ground and tossed them back into her purse, and half-ran down the alleyway, her heels clacking on the cobblestone floor.

It's been there since five years ago.Every so often, I can hear it a little more loudly, as if it's gotten closer somehow, and then it disappears again.Like that short pause on the radio in between songs, when they're switching the track out.Only it's the same song, over and over and over again.I've tried getting help before.The psychiatrist said something about PTSD.About how sometimes you see echoes of the terrible things that have happened to you, and sometimes they stay."I don't think I'm traumatized by my boyfriend's death," I tell him."I didn't particularly like him."The psychiatrist looks at me and frowns.He writes something down in his little notebook."Interesting," he says.I stare at the knick on the back of my hand and remember that safety is a word I can associate with home now."You should go out more," my friends tell me."It's been five years since your boyfriend died.You have to move on."I always feel like I should tell them I moved on six years ago, but I always shut my mouth.Some things are better left unsaid.Unimagined.Some things can only hurt if you bring them back into the light.It was on a Saturday when it happens.When I finally decide that I can't stay at home on Fridays anymore and live my whole life in fear of men.So I go out to the Glacier with just a couple of friends.The ones who know.But the closer I get, the louder the song gets.As if it had been waiting for me the entire time, just waiting for this moment where it could lure me in like a fish on a hook.I fall for it, following the song around the floor, dancing around the edges, when it disappears into the men's room.Without a moment of hesitation, I open the door to face a man inside who I've never seen before.Who are you?he asks me.His eyes are a light blue, almost white, and they remind me of glaciers.I have to admit, he's a handsome man."That song," I ask."What is it?You were singing it."He looks surprised for a split second before he splits into a grin."You can hear it?"he asks."Yes," I say."You want to know why?"He walks slowly toward me, and it's now that I notice he's dressed in a suit and tie.That's strange, I think."Yes," I say out loud.He caresses my cheek, and I lean into his fragrance.It smells like jasmine, like roses, like heaven."After people have been in an accident, they become...sensitive," he says."Their range of hearing increases."He draws me closer, into his embrace, and all I can feel is the warmth of his arms around me, the heat of his hands splayed against the small of my back."I like to sing in that particular range because,"--he breathes in deeply, and I wonder if he's taking in my scent--"there's something so supple about someone whose broken."In the back of my mind, I know I should be afraid.I know something's wrong.But my hands draw him closer, bringing his lips down to mine.He's a drug I never knew existed.And one I could never give up.His lips are as cold as ice, but as soft as snow."So what's that song?"I ask again.He leans back slightly, and it's at that moment I realize I should run.But my feet are glued to the ground, and my hands are stuck to his chest.Something is keeping me here.He blinks, and his pupils turn into slits, like a cat's eyes.He grins, and his canines are sharp.Much too sharp for a human."It's a siren song."

Upon seeing where Lilith led them, Marnie wasn't entirely sure she believed that Mr. Hyde was real.She gazed at the decrepit house--a good portion of shingles missing from the roof and the windows boarded up--with suspicion.She wasn't being kidnapped, was she?It wasn't possible that someone actually lived in this kind of house?But the rest of the group didn't hesitate, following Lilith up to the door as she knocked on the door three times before simply opening the door and letting herself in.The inside of the house was really not much better than the outside.Dust covered every inch of the hardwood floors, and the furnishings were decidedly bare, with plaster chipping off of the walls."Mr.Hyde!"Lilith called out.To be honest, Marnie didn't really expect a response.So she was shocked when a croaky voice called out from somewhere inside."Kitchen."They filed deeper into the house until they reached a room that looked the slightest bit more habitable.But only slightly.Piles and piles of papers littered the floor and the only furniture in the large room was an oak desk toward the back, piled high with more papers.Lilith led them through the mess back towards a connecting room.Marnie blinked when they reached it.The kitchen was neat and tidy, seemingly taken from the pages of a magazine, and most certainly did not fit the rest of the house."You've made a mess again," Lilith chided, crossing her hands over her chest and frowning at the old man who sat in a chair at the kitchen table.The kindly looking old man grinned at her.His glasses were comically enormous, magnifying his eyes, and Marnie fought the urge to laugh as his gaze swept over them.When he reached her, his eyes lit up.He clambered from his chair and scurried towards her.Marnie instinctively took a step back.He clasped at her hands as he reached her, examining her from head to toe, his head swishing this way and that."Marnie, welcome.Ahh, you're the original, the original.And what a good day it is to see you.""What do you mean, original?"she asked."It means you were the first," the old man explained."You somehow created a rip in spacetime, and the others followed suit after that.So nice to meet you.So nice to meet you."The old man shook her hand vigorously."Um, nice to meet you too," Marnie said."Mr. Hyde, now that Marnie's here, what do we do?"Lilith interjected.The old man blinked once before snapping his fingers."Ah yes, I've got the information you need."He disappeared through the doorway into the living room, where they could hear him digging through piles of papers.Marnie looked around the kitchen, her gaze meeting Kayn's.He gave her a nod and a little smile.She smiled back awkwardly.Mr. Hyde scurried back with a large roll of paper tucked under his arm.He quickly moved it towards the table and spread it out."Okay, so I've pinpointed each location where you fell through on the map.That's where you'll need to be to get back when the next wave happens.""Wave?"Anna asked.Mr. Hyde adjusted his glasses."Think of it this way.You guys aren't supposed to be here.If we imagine this universe as a giant plane, you came through some tears in it.This has upset the balance so that every so often, the universe kind of...the universe kind of undulates, like a wave."The last boy in their group nodded this time."So the tears open up when it does."Mr. Hyde clapped his hands together."Smart boy, Adam!Precisely!I would keep you here if I could," he muttered."But the frequency of these waves are growing closer and closer together, and the last I've calculated, they're happening every month.The next one is tomorrow, at 2:07pm.""What effects do these waves have?"Marnie asked.Mr. Hyde looked at her, his expression serious."When waves travel more rapidly, they become vibrations.And you know what happens to wine glasses that vibrate at their resonant frequency?"He set down his glasses down on the table, and for the first time, Marnie noticed his hands shaking."They shatter."*****

Kieran knocked on the wooden door with intricate design patterns three times rapidly, then twice slowly.He leaned against the doorframe patiently, his eyes closed, listening to the sound of childrens screams and shouts nearby.A small wooden slot in the center of the door opened a tiny crack, and an eye appeared briefly before it slammed shut.Then, from inside came the sound of clicks and brass sliding against metal.Fivethreeone

He opened his eyes at the sound of the last lock being opened and watched as the door swung inward to unveil a cloaked figure about half his height.Small hands came up and pulled the hood back, revealing a square face lined with wrinkles, a broad forehead, and a large grin.Baduk! Kieran laid a hand on the wizards shoulder, flashing him a matching grin.Come, come in! His friend played the gracious host, sweeping his arm inward.Though his frame was small, his voice was deep and gravelly.Kieran walked in, ducking his head slightly to make it through the doorway that was just a couple of inches too short.Harkstone tended to customize the living abodes to each players character model, so for a halfling like Baduk, that meant everything was just a little bit shorter.He glanced around.I love what youve done with the place.  

The last time hed been here, the walls were covered ceiling to floor with mounted skulls from all sorts of monsters you could possibly think of, from Vexspawns to Hellwings.Baduk had made it his mission to kill every monster in Harkstone at least once for his collection.Kieran peered at the stacks of tiny mason jars on the large bookshelf that took up an entire wall.Baduk had miniaturized all the skulls each to the size of a walnut and then plopped each of them in a jar.And the walls were now plastered in sheets of parchment, all tacked to the wall on top of a map of Harkstone and linked together in a web of red string.He took a closer glance.Not just writing, but photos.Well, sketches.But accurate enough to pass for photos.Earlier in the year, Harkstone had released an item called a Nymble, available only by speaking to a specific NPC in a quest.An easter egg.It basically acted like a camera, but the resulting picture came out in sketch form.Youve been spending a lot of time trying to track them, havent you? Kieran scanned the sketches until he saw a familiar face: an olive green, scaly, reptilian face with a crescent shaped tattoo next to his left eye.Baduk growled.They keep changing locations.One day its  Eldham and the next its Redwater.They keep teleporting all over the map, and I havent been able to determine how theyre picking the next spot.

Kieran nodded.He had spent quite a bit of time on the situation before Lisa arrived, but he hadnt been able to pull away after.Before his death, he and Baduk had done everything together in-game.It was by chance that they realized a group of Myrgs were using the game to transport drugs like heroine and cocaine.Afterwards, it had become their goal to try and get enough information and evidence to contact the police.Baduk shook his head, his small pointed ears twitching.Regardless, they wont be here for the next month, so well have to worry about it later. 

What do you mean? 

Wait.You havent heard? 

Kieran frowned.What should I have heard? 

Baduk laughed, a sound like boulders rolling down a hill.I thought you knew everything, what with your claim of being a digital phantom. He used air quotes around the last two words, then chuckled, clearly amused by his own impersonation.Oh man, so exciting to know something you dont.Anyways, no ones coming in or out for a whole month. 

What do you mean? He was beginning to sound like a parrot now.It *means*here, Baduk paused for dramatic effectthat Harkstone decided to do a global final beta test before they finally launch version 1.0.The last day to pull out of testing was yesterday.Everyone whos in the game right now has signed a contract agreeing to stay here for the next month, real time. 

So six months game time. 

Yeah. Baduk shrugged, then plucked at a loose string on his cloak before looking up.I think its not a bad idea, to be honest. 

Kieran felt like he was going to tear his hair out.What on earth had Lisa been thinking?!Suddenly, he heard a ding go off in his ear.He pulled up his messages, then frowned.What did she mean they were in the castle?As far as he knew, that area wasnt even open yet, and the only quest came from the guard standing in front of the castle doors.Hey, have new castle quests opened up for the beta test? 

Not that Ive heard of.Why? 

Lisa said shes *in* the castle. 

Baduks ears perked up.Lisa?As in your sister, Lisa? 

Kieran didnt respond, instead pulling up the partys map.Two gray dots, right on top of castle.He tapped on Lisas dot.Last online: 14 minutes ago.He felt a frisson of fear run down his back.Baduk had just said it was impossible for players to log out.And how could there be quests in an undeveloped part of the world map?Screw it.He was just going to ask for Lisas forgiveness later for breaking the rules.He tapped on the dot again, this time closing his eyes and concentrating on that point on the map.Instead of landing on his feet like he usually did after teleporting, he felt himself launched backwards.He cried out in pain as his back slammed against a hard surface.His eyes opened to a closeup of Baduks square face.Are you okay? 

Kieran pushed him aside and pulled up the map to try again.The same thing, only now the stitch in his side probably meant he was internally bleeding.He grabbed a small, swirling red sphere from his tunic and popped it into his mouth.It exploded into a tasteless liquid a little more viscous than water that soothed his throat as it went down.His health bar went back up to full.What happened? Baduk busied himself picking up the parchment that had fallen to the ground from Kieran blasting into his wall twice.He grimaced.I dont know.But I have to head to the castle.Something really weirds going on. 

Ill come with you, Baduk offered.He grabbed his wooden staff from the corner of the room.He hesitated outside his door, glancing at Kieran, who was taking long strides and already almost out of sight past the row of houses, and then back at his house.His feet shifted for a second before he sprinted after his friend.He would only be gone for a short while.Surely it would be fine if it was unlocked for such a short amount of time.*****

Lisa stared at the mean blob-looking thing in front of her.It stood almost a foot off the ground, and it was currently eyeing her.She kept her gaze firmly on it and her dagger out, just to make sure it wouldnt pounce while she wasnt looking.Not that it looked like it could.It didnt have any legs.Ardissia clung to her other arm, her own vine whip coiled around her arm.Do youdo you wanna go first? 

Um 

Lisa glanced toward Kieran, who was currently sitting on a large rock with his face toward the sky, his eyes closed.The kid was sunbathing.They were here trying to kill a monster, and he was sunbathing.She grabbed a small pebble from the ground and launched it at him.He tilted his body slightly back without opening his eyes.You realize that even though Im agreeing to your rules of doing this correctly, Im still kind of omniscient, right?Also, we need to gold if were going to do anything in the town.And you need to level up.So Ill just sit here until youre done. 

Lisa glared at him, then turned back to the Banebug that still sat there, its antennae working madly as it bounced in place.She could see the coin hovering inside its body.They *did* need gold badly.It wouldnt do to just wear cloth rags all the time, and she could already feel an ache building in the soles of her feet from the rough terrain.The path to Harksdale wasnt the smooth cobblestone of the marketplace, but dirt, with jagged rocks that would crop up every now and then.With a sigh, she took out her dagger and launched it at the blob.Unfortunately, the angle wasnt right, and the handle simply bounced off the creature.The blob stared at her, unmoving.Just make sure you dont get splashed.Otherwise, theyre literally harmless, Kieran called out from his rock.Lisa grabbed her dagger and tried again, this time grabbing it firmly in her right hand and stabbing downwards into its flesh.It gave easily, what little surface tension giving way to the consistency of jello.With a small blubber, the Banebug exploded into a fountain of coins that immediately flew towards her and disappeared.That wasnt too bad.Next to her, Ardissia had begun clearing out some of the Banebugs a couple tree lengths away, her vine whipping through the air merrily as she danced around, gathering coins."We're leaving in thirty minutes!"Kieran yelled.Lisa set her sights toward the trees a little distance away, where she could see the rounded heads of several gelatinous Banebugs.Alright then.Thirty minutes to kill as many of these bad boys as she possibly could.&nbsp;

Lisa tested the knife in her hand, whipping it through the air several times and testing its weight.It was better than the dagger for sure.She tucked it into her sheath and handed the dagger over to the balding man, then pulled up her profile.She still had enough gold for a pair of shoes and some extra health potions.She glanced over at Ardissia, who was across the street, gazing longingly at a leafy bracelet that would give +10 health.Where was Kieran though?He had disappeared again.Suddenly, the sound of shouts drew her attention.She watched as the crowd began to part, everyone shuffling backwards toward the sides of the streets.She pushed her way to the front.What appeared to be guards decked out in full armor processed down the street, their swords glinting as they held them out, ensuring no one would block their path.The man at the front, a tough looking fellow with a large beard and a scar running from his right eye down to his cheek, perused the crowd as they marched.Every once in a while, his steely gaze would land on a player, and he would point to them.Then the guards behind him would grab themsome going willingly, others protestingand push them in between the guards, so they couldnt escape.Hey! The sound of a girls shout caught her attention, and she turned to see Ardissia struggling against a soldiers grip.Without thinking, she dashed toward them, pushing the guard aside with all her might.But the guard didnt budge.Instead, the guard at the front turned to her, examining her from top to bottom before jerking his head toward the other guards.One reached forward and grabbed her.Kieran! she shouted out, but her voice was lost in the crowd.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*Were in the castle.* She sent the message off to Kieran, then took a small step closer to Ardissia.A group of around fifty of them had been marched into the castle and were now awaitingsomething or someone.In front of them, stair steps led up to a platform, and its center sat a golden throne.The guards who had taken them in had retreated towards the pillars that framed the room at set intervals, each standing completely still, without even an idle animation, and it was the first time Lisa felt nervous.And if the fingertips that were digging into her arm meant anything, Ardissia felt it too.Only the head guard stood with them, completely still.Suddenly, the curtain behind the throne glided open, and a short, rotund man dressed in garishly red robes pranced into sight, a crown that seemed too large for his head perched precariously as he walked down the steps.He chortled, and the sound echoed through the room.Lisa winced.Hello, one and *all*! The man spread his arms wide, as if welcoming a huge crowd.I amthe king! He stood up tall, or as tall as he could, and closed his eyes with his face tilted upward, as if he were awaiting applause.When none came, he frowned.I have called you all *here* today because I have a *task* for you, should you *choose* to accept it. 

He daintily clapped his hands together twice, and a portal appeared behind him next to the throne.With small, eager steps, he danced up to the throne and sat down.My *high priest* has told me that he needs some *help* with one of his *experiments*.So *you all*he pointed a finger at the crowd and swept it acrossare the *lucky ones* who get to try out this new *beta* level!Dont thank me *too* much.So! he sat up straight, his eyes thinning into slits in his pudgy face.Would you *like* to try it out? 

Two buttons suddenly appeared before each player, large and translucent.One of the players in the front of the crowd quickly tapped no. 

The king laughed.*Great* choice.Off to the dungeons you go! He flicked his hand at the player, and then they vanished.Now who *else* would like to make their decision?I would like you to *know*he blew on a fingernailthat you could get a really nice *prize* for winning.  

Lisa and Ardissia glanced at each other.The game was clearly forcing a choice.Ardissia tilted her head slightly, contemplatively, then nodded at Lisa, her green eyes wide.One by one, most of the players hit yes, while the rest vanished.*Good*, good.Now in you go! The king gestured toward the portal.One by one, they filed in.When Lisa reached the portal, she stopped.She reached forward hesitantly, toward the swirling purple, and watched as her hand disappeared.But she felt no pain.So with a deep breath and a glance of reassurance back at Ardissia, she stepped forward into the darkness.*****

The earth was covered with our kind, once.When the trees grew taller than the birds could fly, and the oceans glittered a bright blue-green, teeming with sea-life beyond all imagination.And we, we came out by night to hunt alongside the owls and leopards.In the beginning, it was just Adrien, Gabrielle, and I, born from an impossible mixture of glacier water and volcanic ash.The sun seared our skin when we awoke, carving fine, black lines across our hard, porcelain flesh, giving us the likeness of marble statues.We were the first Gods, revered as much as we were feared.In the fifth year of our existence, Gabrielle and I fell in love.She would spend the long days running her hand over the small cracks that were growing larger and larger on my skin, due to accidentally getting caught out here and there over time.We would murmur words of love back and forth, discussing all the places we would visit every time the darkness descended.I suppose it was inevitable that Adrien would grow jealous.When you are the only three of your kind, it is difficult having no one, despite how close we all were.You see, at this time, we had no idea that leaving humans partially drained would transform them.It was only by accident three years later, when Adrien would abandon a girl halfway after experiencing a brief moment of guilt, when Lucille would join our ranks.The first of many that would come after.But regardless, at this moment in time, Adrien had no inkling that it wouldn't just be the three of us for the rest of eternity.And so in a fit of jealousy, he challenged me to a fight, up on Scavenger's Peak, a cliff edge where we'd often sat until just before dawn, reminiscing about the only time we'd really seen the sun.We were evenly matched.Almost impossibly so, our lithe figures identically strong from having run the same distance, shared the same kills.And so we matched each other blow for blow, our frenzy crescendoing, until Gabrielle found us, pleading that it was almost dawn.She reached for Adrien and I, attempting to pull us back under the cover of the trees, at least.In a fit of blood rage--a state we hadn't experienced except for that brief moment at creation--Adrien shoved her.Hard.And it shouldn't have mattered.Except the blood rage had given him more strength than he'd realized, and so she catapulted over the edge of the cliff.I still remember the way her eyes widened, her mouth opened into an expression of shock and surprise, even as she vanished into the waters below.I wanted to go down after her.But it was at that precise moment that the sun peaked over the horizon.Against my will, Adrien dragged me back into the shadows, the words of apology constantly at his lips the entire time.I'm sorry, he said, over and over again.I didn't know.I had no idea.I am so, so sorry.We assumed Gabrielle was dead.Even if she hadn't drowned, the sunlight would've killed her, the water providing no cover and no protection.Night after night, I returned to the water's edge, calling out her name, hoping beyond hope.But it was an exercise in futility, a desperate plea for an impossibility.A way to remember her during the long days and longer nights.Only one night, as I called out her name yet again, there was a soft, faint response.At first I'd thought I hallucinated.Seventeen years of hopelessness would do that to a person quite easily.But then I called out her name again, the response came again, louder this time.And Gabrielle, my Gabrielle broke the surface of the water, her legs no longer, but a beautiful, strong fin in its place.Bronze and mechanical.She told me that, at that height, her legs had shattered upon impact.She had sunk to the bottom of the sea, where there was no light at all.We didn't need air to survive, and so she laid there, unable to move, thinking she would live an eternity in a watery grave, until an anchor dropped beside her.With the last of her strength, she'd grabbed onto it.The fisherman built her her tail.Come with me, she pleaded.To where we'll never have to hide again.Come with me, please.I hesitated for but a moment.And then I stepped out into the water.

"Lucille's such an artist, isn't she?"Sadie mused, letting out a little sigh as she let her fingers glide over the sheet of paper hanging from the corkscrew board.The crayon drawing portrayed a small, blonde haired girl, her hands covering her eyes, crying.Two angel wings lay at her feet."She must've been an angel in her past life."Judas's lips thinned."Of course dear," he made out, continuing to casually lean against his daughter's door, but his fists clenched behind his back.He would've thought the same too.Wouldn't have known.If not for that night.&nbsp;

*** 

&nbsp;

"Father, why did you forsake me?"The sobbing sounds became louder as he approached the door.Lucille.Was she referring to him?It was a good thing he had still been up, grading papers.His little angel was having nightmares.He gingerly opened the door, and without turning on the lights, walked toward the bed in the corner, where he could hear her tossing about in her sleep.She was almost incoherent, rapidly babbling words that he didn't quite recognize, her arms twisting from side to side."Shhh, it's okay, honey," he whispered to her, "it's okay."But instead of calming down, Lucille simply seemed to grow more agitated.Judas watched her tiny eyebrows furrowing in the dim moonlight shining through the blinds.The pale light cast an unearthly glow, giving her skin an almost translucent quality.A frisson of fear, completely unexpected, ran up his spine.Judas set a hand on her arm.It was scalding hot, inhumanly so.A pulse ran up his arm, followed immediately by flashes of images.A golden city.Bloody wings.And a deep, dark chasm, accompanied by such a sense of helplessness and rage that he could feel his heart squeezing, suffocating, in his chest.He jerked his hand back, and the images vanished.Lucille had calmed down, her breathing steady now, but Judas could still see the beads of sweat on her forehead, the way her eyebrows knit together.The expression no seven year old should ever have.And suddenly, he understood why they'd always found her standing in the corner, staring morosely out the window of the kindergarten classroom, refusing to interact with her classmates.They had thought she was shy.An introvert.And that she would come out of her shell given time.Why she would sometimes for no reason at all begin crying.Not tantrums, like other children had, no.Not even bawling, the way normal kids cried.Just completely silent, with tears streaming down her face as she didn't say a word.He and Sadie had never managed to understand the feeling of profound sadness she'd exuded in those moments, as if the entire world had abandoned her.Only now he knew.&nbsp; 

*** 

&nbsp; 

Judas's fist clenched tighter around the crumpled drawing in his hand.The one of a girl, locked away in a cell, bloodied wings next to her.And around her, just black, inky darkness."Come on, dear," he said."We need to go pick her up now."Sadie let out another little sigh of happiness before she brushed past him out of the room, humming a tune.Judas shut his eyes for a brief moment.Then he walked out behind her.

"Report for work tomorrow.1635 Corning Way.Don't be late," the voice drawled.Then it withdrew its hand from Lucas's grasp.By the next morning, Lucas had no recollection of the events that had occurred.Only a vague sense of unease that pervaded his senses.He was forgetting something.Something important.Only he had no earthly idea what.It was later that night, after he'd climbed back into bed, that he realized he'd forgotten about that voice.The low moan that that reverberated through his skull, threatening to deafen him.*1635 Corning Way.* 

Lucas jumped out of bed.Without bothering to change out of his pajamas, he slipped on his tennis shoes.And he began to walk.Without his phone, he had no idea of knowing where he was heading.Only...there was something directing him.Some sense--whenever he turned--that informed him of the rightness or wrongness of his decision.A tiny little compass that didn't point north.He wasn't quite sure how long he'd been walking.Only that he'd passed by three parks and past two houses where he could've sworn there were people peeping out at him, and yet he couldn't recall at all what anything looked like.They blurred in his mind.Suddenly, he was there.He didn't know how--he'd never been in this neighborhood before in his life--but he was there.Without hesitating, he walked up to the door and twisted the knob.It was unlocked.Like the house had been waiting for him.Like it was inviting him in.And so he went in, into the dark hallway, into the dark, empty house.He shuffled toward the room on the end of the hallway, to the left.The room lay threadbare, other than a bedside table and the bed.Without giving it much thought, he got to his knees, then turned around and laid on the ground, face up, perpendicular to the bed.Steadily, he slid his way underneath.*Why was he here?* The question dimly flickered in his mind before vanishing.No.He knew why he was here.Lucas laid there, in the complete darkness of the room, his breathing steady and even.&nbsp;

He had been hired.

It was the next day noon before they arrived.Luna stood tall, her bare feet silent on the carpet as she walked through the hallowed hall of the mosque toward an unknown future.The soldier followed behind her.Luckily, he'd had to leave his blade at the door.The courtyard of the mosque was open to the sky, the shade provided coming from pillars that splayed into fan-like canopy, bathing the ground in a warm, yellow light.At the other end of the room, a man sat with his back towards them, wearing a simple white shirt and trousers and draped in a blanket.As they approached, the soldier called out."Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon you," he said, stopping ten steps away from the man.Luna stopped as well, her heart pounding her ears.The man stood and turned to face them, his large, brown eyes settling on her briefly before he gave them a warm, pleasant smile.His beard hid his expression as the soldier briefly explained what had occurred.While the soldier talked, Luna looked him up and down.He was a handsome man, no doubt.With long muscular limbs and a long, thick eyelashes, she could understand why people were so willing to follow him.He suddenly turned his gaze on her, and she nearly jumped."What is your name, young one?"Muhammad asked."Luna, Prophet Muhammad," she replied."Luna, this man tells me you have let go a man that Allah says was to be punished.Can you explain what happened?"His tone was pleasant, but the underlying tone of sternness didn't escape her.She swallowed.She was stepping on a lot of toes by faking a prophet, and if she said the wrong words, this could very well be her last moments on earth."I am not from this place," she finally said."I'm from another star.Allah has sent me here to correct a wrong, and my duty has been accomplished."She didn't dare look at his eyes, for fear that he would see the way she was sweating through her clothes and call her out.Killian had always said she was a terrible liar."Is that so?"he asked, his voice deadpan."Allah wishes to pardon that man?""Yes, prophet," Luna said, her eyes downcast still.Her hands were beginning to sweat profusely, and if he didn't let her go soon, she was one hundred percent going to break down."I hope you understand that I require some sort of...proof," Muhammad finally said."There are many who claim to be prophets, only to have experienced God's wrath upon being proven false."Was that a threat?That was definitely a threat.Luna looked up.Muhammad had the same pleasant smile on his face, but there was a hard look in his eyes that belied his gentle expression."Of course," she said, her lips numb.Then an idea popped into her head."I can prove I'm from another star," she said."Tonight at midnight.I will return.""Oh?"Muhammad asked, his expression contemplative."Then I shall look forward to it.I cannot save you from the punishment of Allah otherwise.Take her to a room to rest."He didn't say anything further, instead sitting down and shutting his eyes.The soldier pressed a hand to Luna's shoulder, and she took that gesture as her cue to leave.As she walked away, she took a deep breath.The implications were pretty clear.If she couldn't make herself vanish at midnight, *he* would make her vanish to the afterlife.&nbsp;

She spent the rest of the day praying.Not to God, but to Killian.He was a time guardian, yes, and a good one, but *for* a time guardian, he was absolutely terrible with time.Five out of six times, he was late to their meetings for one reason for another, and several times, he had forgotten them altogether, only to come back and text her a day later, confirming the meeting time.*Please, Killian, just this once,* she begged to the skies.*Be on time, just this once.* 

&nbsp; 

Night fell altogether too soon.The soldier came to get her from her room shortly before midnight, leading her outside the mosque.She might've been able to appreciate the splendor of the smooth, almost translucent marble flooring in front had her life not been at stake.But as it stood, she could only clutch the dim time capsule in her hand."It's almost midnight," Muhammad said, his figure a tall shadow under the light of the moon.She couldn't quite make out his expression, but that was probably a good thing."Yes," she said, bringing out the time capsule and holding it in front of her.*Killian, please.* 

The minutes ticked by, but the capsule remained dim.Her heart pounded faster.No.Killian would remember.She would be out of here in a couple of seconds.Just a couple."Raamiz," Muhammad said softly, and Luna heard the sound of metal scraping against bronze as a dark shadow walked toward her.She turned to run when warmth began to seep into her palm.She glanced down.The time capsule was pulsing again, glowing a deep, brilliant blue.She laughed in relief, whipping around and taking in Muhammad's shocked expression as they bathed in the light of the capsule.It glowed brighter and brighter before a flash of white light made her surroundings disappear.The next second, she was thrown back in darkness again, but the dim glow of the monitor assured her she was safe this time."That took you forever!"she complained, setting the time capsule on the table."I was watching a show," Killian said, bringing a finger up and adjusting his glasses."So I'm assuming things went well if you have the effort to complain about me?"Luna glared at him."You nearly got me killed."Correction: you nearly got yourself killed.You wouldn't be in this mess in the first place if you'd just listened to me."Luna blinked, then sheepishly smiled at him."Thank you for cleaning up my mess."Killian tutted, but reached forward and ruffled her hair."Go and get some sleep.I had to tell the Academy about your little antics, and luckily they're not too angry, but they do want to see you tomorrow.""Why?"Her shoulders slumped.Were they going to tell her she couldn't associate with Killian anymore?Killian stared at her woeful expression before breaking into a chuckle."Don't worry.I've talked to them about your amazing progress.Tomorrow, you become an official Time Guardian in-training."

Gorlin's eye twitched.This was not how he'd imagined things going down.He gazed impassively as the man who would have been his perfect partner-in-crime, Yeshnu, slowly dissolved in the lake of lava, the viscous liquid bubbling and hissing as it swallowed him whole.Gorlin brought a hand up to his temple and massaged it with the pads of his fingertips, careful to keep his long, black fingernails away from his skin.He'd given himself an accidental scratch more than once, and although it he was glad that his minions thought he'd returned from yet another skirmish with superheroes, he didn't appreciate the pain.He *hated* paper cuts, and these hurt more than those.A sharp exhale from behind him caught his attention.He turned to face a small, roundish jelly blob, its large eyes gazing at him in wonder as it blubbered something excitedly in Lecurian."No!"Gorlin protested, exasperated, his eyebrows knitting together."I did *not* kill him on purpose!"The minion continued to blubber, its tinny voice raising higher in pitch now."For the last time, Koozor, he fell in himself," Gorlin argued through gritted teeth."I can't help it if they're all inherently stupid.And I don't want to hear anymore about it!"He stalked off the metal platform, his heavy steel boots clunking against the grated metal and echoing in the vast chamber.He stormed toward his chamber, ignoring the crowds of minions asking various questions along the way.He dove into his bed, rolled himself in the black, silk covers, and began to sulk.It was really quite unfair.Maluna, his mortal enemy, basically got everything right on the first try.She'd not only taken out Core, a key member of the Alliance of the Superheroes, but she'd also managed to earn their respect by making it onto their list of Top Level Threats.That was even higher status than the list of Critical Threats, which any self respecting villain had to make it onto, otherwise they risked not getting an invitation to the annual Evil Gala.If you didn't make it onto the list for the Evil Gala, you might as well not exist.Cooperating with Yeshnu had been a last resort--he really didn't care for the guy much--and it was once again a bust.He groaned.And there was only two days left before the gala.He was screwed.He was really, really screwed.Just as he was about to try and begin concocting another brilliant scheme, his wrist began to buzz.Someone was at his lair entrance.Gorlin pressed on the answer button, and a large screen popped up in midair.When he saw who it was though, his lips pursed together."What do you want?"he grunted.The boy with silver hair in the middle of the screen grinned."Hey, buddy!We heard what happened!""Yeah, you're all over the news!You're a hero!"Nevi, the girl next to him, nodded excitedly, her ponytail bouncing up and down.Little flickers of fire sparked around her as she jumped up and down.Marcel, the boy, sidestepped to avoid the flames.Gorlin wanted to scream.It was definitely Koozor.That little blob had the biggest fucking mouth."For the last time," Gorlin growled, "I'm not joining your stupid society.And you can take back your celebratory statements.They're not welcome here.""Oh, come on, Gorlin," Nevi coaxed, her hazel eyes bright as she gazed into the security camera she knew he was using to monitor them."The annual Super Ball is coming up the day after tomorrow, and your presence is *highly requested* by everyone.Everyone's so excited to meet the new superhero that's taken out three baddies in less than six months.""I'm not coming!"he finally shrieked, climbing up from his bed and hopping up and down in anger."How many times must I tell you I'm a super villain?!When are you going to get it through your thick skulls?!"He breathed in and out heavily, glaring at the screen even though he knew they couldn't see his expressions.Nevi's ponytail seemed to droop slightly, but Marcel just gave him a pitying glance."Hey, man, we understand.We all see ourselves as the villain sometimes.But you gotta know that you're a good guy, and you've saved a lot of people."He waved the golden envelope in his hand at the security camera."I'll leave the invitation here.You should really consider coming."He stuffed it into the mailbox, and they left.Gorlin shut off the screen and folded his arms over his chest.This was utterly infuriating.Were these superheroes just completely dim?What was wrong with them?Whatever.He had to think up another scheme before the Evil Gala.He shut his eyes, the gears in his head grinding.Then his eyes popped open.His lips thinned.He couldn't.He shouldn't.But...It was really hard being a super villain.Really, really hard.And if you thought about it, recognition was recognition, regardless what the source was.That's all he really wanted anyway, to be famous.He sucked in a deep breath.Fuck it.He pressed the button on the wall to side of his bed."Koozor, go grab the mail and bring it to me."

"Mr. Rowland!He's that way!"Nurse Clements shouted, chewing on the pencil-tip as she squinted at the battlefield farthest away from her.The old man gazed wildly about before turning around and ambling toward his opponent, a Mr. Lester.Aspen Clements sat back in her chair and sighed.She used to have the great job of being able to send the old coots on their merry way as Battle Nurse.It was a difficult position to obtain--she'd had to take five different examinations, some psychological, some physical, but all ridiculously competitive--but now, due to rising demand, she'd been promoted.To Battle *Facilitator.* The higher ups insisted it simply wasn't practical to pay for one duel when they could have her preside over five at the same time, with a possibility of up to ten deaths, if they were lucky enough."Thomas!I told you no wedgies!"Aspen dropped her clipboard on the chair and stalked up to the ring closest to her.She reached over the rope and dragged the old man back, forcing him to let go of his poor victim, who had been driven to tears over the humiliating treatment.Thomas, a grizzled old man with fifty battles under his belt but who unfortunately had the humor of a three year old, simply cackled and picked his axe back up."Ha!"A line of blood splattered over Aspen's face before she could tell him to wait for her to leave the ring.Thomas tugged the axe from the other man's back and turned to face her.He gave her an almost toothless grin."So who's my next victim?"he asked, an eager glint in his eyes.Aspen wrinkled her nose, wiping her face as she sighed."Cleanup in ring three!"she shouted at the boy nodding off in the corner of the large room.The boy jerked up, the mop in his hand clanging to the floor.He hurriedly picked it up and sprinted over, the bucket of suds in his other hand sloshing over the sides.Aspen had to jump to dodge to the side so her newly bought leather boots wouldn't get the drowning treatment."Yes, marm!"the boy said, and then ducked under the ring and began cleaning the blood off the floor.Two other guards had already dragged the body away.Aspen turned around and headed back to grab her clipboard.She had to find another victim for the old coot.Thomas seemed to be more into the idea of battling again than in death.Otherwise he would've let someone off him already.Or maybe he wanted to pad his stats so he could gloat in front of his old war buddies in Valhalla.Regardless, it wasn't her duty to question his motives.Hale Sanders.97.Cataracts.She shook her head.He would be too weak.Thomas would complain about the lack of a challenge again, and she wasn't interested in listening to him grumble and groan, as he'd been doing for the past three days.A shadow landed on her clipboard."Sorry," she said without looking up."We don't take walk-ins.If you want to make an appointment, you'll have to talk to the front desk.""Aspen," the person in front of her said, his voice low and gravelly.Aspen froze.Then she slowly looked up, her face draining of color.Bright blue eyes met hers.The old man gave her a smile, the scar going across his face not taking away from his handsome features at all."Dad," she choked out."What are you doing here?It's not your time yet.""It's been past my time.Two years past," he rasped, looking down.The back of her throat closed up.She knew he'd been dejected ever since mom died.But he was strong, and she thought...he'd be able to live a hundred more years.He'd always been her hero.But he'd aged more in the last two years than he had in the past twenty.Even heroes needed to rest.She sniffled, straightening her shoulders and standing at attention, only the barest blink of her eyes giving away emotion."Name?""Conley Clements.""Specifications for weapons?""Bow and arrow."Aspen's eyes fogged up.Her dad was a terrible shot.He was blind in one eye, and even if he wasn't, he was more liable to hit his teammate next to him than the target in front."Any final requests?""I'd like you to do the honors," he said softly.She nodded jerkily, gesturing to the guards to clear the leftmost field.Their walk there together was silent.She didn't know what to say.She took the bow from the guard and he handed the other to her father.They stood there, in the center of the ring.What could she even say?"Thank you," her father finally said.He walked toward the other end of the ring."Not at all," she whispered, taking one step back, then another.There was a dull ringing in her ears.Once they were both in position, she took in a deep, ragged breath."At arms," she said, her voice quavering.She watched as her father lifted his bow.In her memory, his arms were always strong and sinewed, but now she could see the pale blue veins in them even from here.They shook."Counting down to one," she said, readying her own bow.Her own hands were surprisingly steady as she slipped the arrow into the notch and drew her arm back, drawing the bow taut.&nbsp;

Three.Two.One.&nbsp;

The arrow flew straight and true.

"Can I stay here for a while?"It was a strange request.Richard stared at the woman who stood in front of him, her eyes downcast.Her brown hair was pulled back into a messy bun, and she wore no makeup, with just a simple pair of jeans and a blouse.She seemed quite timid as well.Her right hand clenched tightly onto her left arm as she looked anywhere but at him."There's not really the option of staying for a while," he said.It was the first time he'd heard someone ask if they could stay in hell 'for a while.'"Your choice is permanent.I hope you know that.""Oh."The woman bit her lip.She wasn't ugly.In fact, Richard might even call her beautiful.Not in a striking way, but rather in a muted way, the kind of pretty you never get sick of looking at."Can I just...wait here a while then?And not go in?"Richard cocked his head."Could I ask why you want to wait here?""I just..."--her gaze drifted--"...haven't made up my mind," she finished lamely."Haven't made up your mind about wanting to go to Heaven or Hell?"Richard repeated slowly.And even though he was supposed to represent Hell, what with being the gatekeeper and all, he couldn't help but feel sorry for this woman who had no idea what she was doing.And his interest was piqued.So he leaned back in his chair."No one has gone to Hell for the last thousand years.No one.""Okay," the woman said simply, nodding her head."Heaven is as advertised.It's all bright lights and joy.You wouldn't like Hell," he continued.What was with this girl?Was she crazy?And why was he trying to convince her to go to Heaven if she was hell-bent on suffering?"I just...I'm waiting for someone," she finally blurted out."Waiting for someone?"She nodded."I'm waiting for my husband."He laughed.That was a hoot.She thought her husband was going to hell.Then he blinked.Wait.That still didn't make sense."You do realize that your husband has a choice, right?So he would go to Heaven."And then he thought of a bigger issue."And if you hated him that much, why would you want to suffer with him?"She shook her head vehemently."Oh, no.I love my husband dearly."Richard's brow furrowed."I don't get it then.""My husband...has some issues.Mentally, and with his self-esteem.He had...a really bad childhood, which made him believe that he was incapable of love.And that others were incapable of love.He told me he doesn't believe in Heaven," the woman continued."He said it's all glamour and falsehoods and that the concept of true joy doesn't exist."The woman took a deep breath."He just gets too stuck in his own head sometimes, and I don't want him going through that alone.So when he dies..." 

Oh.So it was for love.Something stirred in his heart.A flash of light blue eyes and brown hair came to mind, and Richard shut his eyes, striking it from his memory."Okay," he said."Name?""Clara," she said.He froze, then jotted it down on his clipboard."You can go in now."Her sound of her footsteps slowly disappeared behind him.He stared out at the placid lake in front of him, the waters so still that the surface might have been solid ground.And maybe subconsciously, he was waiting for someone to come.For the man to come.Or for someone else.A girl with blue eyes and brown hair, and who had once looked at him like he was her everything.Until she hadn't.He wanted to have as much faith in his choice as she did in hers."Clara," he said slowly.The word stuck to the roof of his mouth.He should have asked the woman the question that had plagued him for the last thousand years.*Is it worth it?*

Alyssa tried to peer into the tinted front window of the car.The car itself was a sleek silver and hugged the ground as it purred down the road toward her.Its windows had been tinted black, and as it rolled up, she squinted to try to see inside."Can I hitch a ride?I'm trying to head down to Eastbourne.Are you headed that way?"The wind blew her hair every which way, and she held down her hat with one hand while readjusting the strap of her pack with the other.There was no response.She tapped on the window."Hello?"The back door of the car whirred, then arced upwards toward the sky as it opened.She peered inside."Can I hitch a ride?"But there was no one there.Simply a blinking GPS signal from the monitor.She frowned.Self-driving cars were nothing new, but this one didn't seem to have instructions or anything, and it didn't look like a taxicab.She backed up and glanced up and down the road.The midday sun soaked through her shirt and sweat drenched down her back as she scanned the road.She had stopped at a tiny town a couple miles back, and they had directed her this way, telling her that another town wouldn't be far off.But it seemed they had been misinformed.It was no matter.This wasn't the first time in her travels that she had been led astray, and she had always made it out okay.Alyssa squinted, peering toward the distance, where there was only dust and sparse trees, as far as the eye could see.And in the far distance, rolling hills and mountain peaks.When she had embarked on this trip, she hadn't known where she wanted to go.It was a spur of the moment decision to leave behind everything familiar, to leave behind friends and family in a small, dingy little town that she had called home for almost 24 years.And now, two years into her journey, the wanderlust hadn't abated.In fact, it had only strengthened, if that was possible.It didn't look like anyone was headed down this way.It was the only car she had seen since leaving the town earlier, which didn't bode well.After a moment of hesitation, she clambered in, immediately welcomed by a strong, cool wind blasting in her face.The doors slowly whirred shut, and the car began driving.Maybe it was a car programmed to pick up weary travelers and bring them to the nearest town, she thought.The pet project of some philanthropist who had too much time on their hands and too much money as well."Just take me to Eastbourne, that's fine," she said into the air.The car continued to purr, with no response from either the blinking GPS signal nor any voice that recognized she had ever spoken at all.But it should be fine.It would drop her off somewhere, and she would simply head out from there, no matter where it was.So Alyssa dropped her large backpack on the floor and laid down on the cool, leather seats.And she closed her eyes.It hadn't felt like she had slept that long, but when she awoke, her throat felt completely parched.Grabbing her water bottle, she took a swig and then looked outside the car windows.Still rolling desert.She was still feeling tired, so she laid back down and went back to sleep.In her dreams, she saw green pastures and wrinkled faces.She saw her mama and papa, who had passed away when she was just a child, and felt their cool hands on her forehead, gently wiping away her fever.And she saw the children, their bellies bloated and faces gaunt.Her eyes startled awake.The car had stopped, and it now sat there and hummed, the engine still running as the door slid open.Alyssa slowly climbed out.She was faced with a crooked fence and an old wooden house.The house of her childhood.The house she had desperately tried to leave because the poverty had beaten her down and she thought that if she were to live like this, she would rather travel the world with her sparse savings.As she watched, the door swung open, and shouting could be heard as an old woman, her hair almost completely white, teetered out with an old man following her."I told you, I dreamed she would be back!I dreamed that my Alyssa would come back to today!"The old woman stated vehemently at the man, who was looking at her with exasperation.Then they both turned, finally noticing the car parked out front.Alyssa felt the ball grow at the back of her throat, even as she took one step, then another, until she was flying into the old woman's arms."Grandmere!"she cried.The old woman patted her back gently, and Alyssa was brought back to the days when she would sit in her grandmother's lap and listen to tales about the wide, wide world."I'm glad you're back, child.I'm glad you're back."Then she clasped Alyssa's hands, and led her into the house.

The man swirled into Kassidy's lab, his black cape flowing behind him.She barely gave him a glance before turning back to her computer.She still had to run the next batch of samples, and if she was even a tiny bit off with the timing, they would become useless.But she couldn't ignore him entirely, she supposed."What do you want?"she asked, then carefully set her vial down and placed the entire group of vials into the freezer.She stripped her gloves.Lucifer narrowed his kohl-rimmed eyes at her."You know very well what I'm here for."Kassidy shrugged."Not sure what you're talking about."He gritted his teeth and walked around the metal table until he was standing right in front of her.He slammed the newspaper down onto the table.Kassidy barely took a look at it before giving him a small smile."Well, congratulations to that little old lady, I suppose.Living until you're 120 years old is quite a feat."He wanted to kill her."Yeah, it would be quite an accomplishment," he said, his jaw clenching, 'if she weren't supposed to die two months ago."He pulled out his tablet and quickly typed in the lady's name, then flipped it around and showed her.On the screen, along with a picture of the elderly women, was the age at which she was supposed to die.Instead of a positive time ticking down towards her death, it was now negative."And I know you gave her that serum you concocted," he hissed."We had a deal."Kassidy raised an eyebrow."We did, in fact.And I am upholding my part of the deal splendidly well."His pale eyes flashed."You know immortality is not to be trifled with."Kassidy scoffed."Right.So only the Gods get it.Because I'm sure you guys clearly deserve it."Lucifer's lips narrowed into a thin line."I forgave that you drank the damn thing yourself.I granted you amnesty.You don't know how *angry* Fred was with me when I told him he couldn't take your soul and had to explain why.He threw a temper tantrum for three days straight, trained Cerberus to basically revolt against me, and then quit his job for a whole week."He paced around the table."People not dying for a whole week.Did you know the horror that caused?Gunshot wounds in stasis, people who should have bled out, dear lord, the number of newspapers I had to forcefully recall."He moaned, clutching his head in his hands."Half my minions are still on holiday because of the overtime."Then he raised his head."And now this.How many people have you given the serum to?"He opened the fridge and pulled out the vial with swirling amber liquid, smashing it against the floor.The liquid evaporated almost immediately upon contact with the air."Just a few," Kassidy said calmly.She shrugged off her lab coat.It looked like she wasn't about to get any more work done today.The last time Lucifer had paid her a visit, he'd stayed for three days and three nights."But I was actually thinking of selling it."Before he realized what he was doing, Lucifer unsheathed his claws, and they hovered inches from her face."Say that again."His tone was deathly calm.If she actually decided to sell the immortality serum, the entire world would be thrown into chaos.The other Gods, who had slumbered since thousands of years ago, would finally awaken, and he would be put on trial for mishandling things.If things turned out badly, he might even be stripped of his title.And where would he be then?Kassidy didn't even blink at his threat.She was used to it by now."You're threatening the mother of your future child?"she asked, then turned around and grabbed her keys from the counter.At first, the question didn't register.Then Lucifer blinked.And blinked again.Mother of his...his eyes widened and flashed with something akin to joy.As much joy as he was capable of feeling, anyhow."You're pregnant?"he asked.His claws sheathed themselves, and he touched Kassidy's arm, turning her around."Since when?"She nearly rolled her eyes at him."Since three months ago.I was going to tell you, but you didn't respond, so I decided to take matters into my own hands."She shrugged.Hence the old lady.He couldn't even be mad at her now."But it's fine.Apparently you didn't think answering my summonings was important enough.So you can head back to Hell now."She walked towards the lab doors.She was mad.He was incredibly bad at reading emotions, but that much he knew."Kassidy, wait up!"he yelled, then followed her out.If anyone could have seen them that day, they would have said Lucifer had scampered after her like a puppy following its owner.*****

Its scaly flesh oozed black pus as it glared at Christopher, hunched over.Its tail flicked back and forth, a sizzling steam coming from its forked tongue as it stood there under the blinking lights.Everyone stood frozen.Was this a social media ploy?The advertisements these days were getting more and more ridiculous, to the point where it was nearly impossible to tell whether anything was merely a grab for attention.The monster shrieked as it dug its claws into the hardwood floor, the loud scraping sound of crackling wood startling Christopher from his reverie.A tingling sensation ran down his spine, even as his hands began to grow cold.This didn't seem like a social media tactic.In fact, the monster seemed very much real.A woman behind him screamed, and all hell broke loose.Customers scrambled every which way, some darting back towards the marketplace, while others took the shortcut toward the self-serve furniture.*Shelves.*

Christopher bolted, his chest heaving.A loud, inhuman shriek sounded behind him, and the deafening clack of claws against wood informed him that the monster had indeed decided to follow him instead of targeting some other poor fool.Just his luck.His mother had told him to light a stick of incense for his ancestors this morning, but he'd been in a rush to go to school, and he'd forgotten.Stupid, stupid.He thought falling down the stairs earlier was just bad luck.But thinking back, the sharp tug on his pant-leg should have alerted him to the fact that there was more at play in Ikea than just bad luck.Poltergeists weren't enough, and now demons?The huge warehouse came into view, the sky-high shelves lined along the sides making him exhale a sigh of relief, even as he maintained a dead sprint toward them.The demon was still struggling in the kitchen section behind them, its claws unable to find purchase on the smooth floors.Until it crashed into the doorframe, its bright green eyes glowing.Christopher ducked behind the shelf and slotted himself into the empty space between two large square boxes.His face was entirely hidden in shadow now, and if he was very quiet, it would likely pass him.He quickly slid his phone open and held onto the "one" key, watching as the image of his mother popped up on the screen.*Pick up.Please pick up.* 

The warehouse grew quiet.Christopher held his breath, his phone gripped tightly in his hand as the faintest sound of the ringing tone from his phone sounded next to his ear.It was too quiet.Unnervingly so.*I'm sorry, the user you have dialed is currently--* 

He pressed the side button to cut off the call, swallowing.Even that sounded abnormally loud to his ears.Then a clacking sound.He held his breath, his muscles tensed up completely as he desperately strained to hear something.Anything.The clacking grew closer.The monster was walking along the outside row of shelves.He shut his eyes tightly.As long as he remained completely silent, it would pass by him.Hopefully it would return to the other dimension after not finding prey.A strong buzzing in his hand startled him.Christopher's eyes popped open, the phone slipping out of his grasp as the screen lit up, his mother's smiling image appearing on the front.It clattered to the ground, vibrating against the ground.NO.He grabbed at it and turned it off, but it was too late.The clacking sounds had stopped.Then they quickened, turning back and heading straight toward him.His back teeth ground together.So this was how it was going to end, after all.He hadn't even had the chance to tell his mother he wanted to go to the academy after all.And now he was never going to get to.He wasn't even going to-- 

"You can come out now."Christopher froze.What?A bright light shone at his feet."Come on out."He slowly climbed out and turned to face the man standing there.He was wearing an Ikea uniform and sharp leather shoes.Christopher's brows knit together.That wasn't right.The demon had definitely been behind him.It had definitely been chasing after them."What happened to the Pang?"The man grinned at him, the flashlight in his hand wavering slightly."Nothing you need to worry about.It's taken care of.We're always prepared for any disaster.But we hope you understand that the store will be closing for the rest of the day due to the damage.So we'll need you to leave.""Of course," Christopher said slowly, his gaze focused on the man's face."What a day, huh?"he said lightly, despite his confusion.The demon had definitely been there.And there was no way to kill a demon or trap it without saying an enchantment out loud.Which he would have heard.Maybe his mother was wrong?The man threw his head back and laughed."What a day," he agreed, giving Christopher a too-bright grin.He gestured toward the exit."Please."Christopher nodded and began walking towards it.He took a couple of steps, then paused and glanced back at the man who was already leaving in the other direction.Maybe it was imagination, but he could've sworn the man had a forked tongue.

Sometimes, revenge is a dish best served warm, with a dash of methane.The oddly shaped bird hopped onto the wooden bench and preened its feathers.It gazed out upon the herd that was no fewer than a thousand strong.The herd of black and white creatures that walked on four legs--not two--who were beginning to rot from the inside out, their innards festering with a kind of illness and bacteria that made the methane gas they produced more potent, more toxic.The bird then waddled toward the metal pails once again.It stopped by the closest one.A splatter of brown and white, and it was done.The water was contaminated, and the cows that drank from the pail would be infected as well.Already, it was beginning.From the article the farmer had dropped on the ground in terror, he knew it would not be long before humanity would tear itself apart from the inside, their desire to consume flesh becoming the reason for their ultimate downfall.He turned an eye toward the pigs, the disgusting, putridly fat creatures that had plundered his mate's nest so long ago, his pupils dilating with fear and disgust.And their brethren, too, without the protection of the humans, would fall.It wasn't long before the epidemic spread from one end of the globe to another, the humans never suspecting that the animal they most revered for its meat would become the cause of their extinction.And he watched, from the safety of the dead farmer's farmhouse, on a black and white screen, the flashing images of despair as the humans choked on their last breaths.When it was all over, he returned to the field, feeling the warm breeze on this feathers.The sun's heat penetrated his skin, leaving a scalding sensation.Depleting the earth's ozone was not without its repercussions.He closed his eyes, and he could almost see his mate walking towards him again, toward their nest, with the white speckled eggs luminous in the sun's light.His eyes closed, he called out to her, a sharp keening sound that pierced the treetops.The cry floated up, and was lost in the wind.

He was silent for a moment before the words slithered from beneath the dark hood, a low raspy sound that only sounded faintly human."You do not wish to die?"The old man coughed, leaning into his sword, which he no longer had the energy to raise."Does anyone?"he wheezed."I have much unfinished business.""Your daughter?"Death asked.He slowly lowered his scythe.The man was frail now.He had used the last of his energy withstanding the blow, and yet...The old man coughed, his chest heaving violently."I must see her get married.I cannot die yet."Death remained silent.He stood there, his robes billowing despite the dead air around them, the darkness beneath his hood completely unfathomable.All of a sudden, the mountain air around them began to chill, a gale of wind whistling past and almost prying the sword from the old man's hands before it disappeared as quickly as it had arrived.When Death spoke again, the old man could hear a strange eagerness to his voice."You would agree to a deal?""Anything," the old man coughed.Death laughed then, an inhuman noise that was as low and raspy as it was high and keening."My favorite word," he said, the words long and drawn out."Good," he said, and then reached out a hand--long and frail, more bone than skin--and touched it to the old man's forehead.Rather than the icy touch he had been expecting, Death's fingertips were scalding to the touch."I have grown weary," he said simply.Before the old man could ask what that sentence meant, he lost consciousness.&nbsp;

When he woke up later, his head pounding, he could feel the fresh life in his veins.His joints no longer ached, and the migraine that had plagued him for the last two years of his life had disappeared.His eyes brightened.He had won.He could go see his daughter again.He got to his feet and reached for his sword.Then he froze.His sword--the sword that his master had forged for him twenty years ago--had disappeared.And in its place, a scythe.The handle was black as night, so pitch dark it looked like it would suck him in if he touched it, and the blade glowed brightly, despite the cloudy sky.He hesitated for a moment before slowly reaching for it.Just as his hand closed around the handle, his surroundings vanished.He now stood in an abandoned barn, alone.He blinked, gazing around at the bales of hay.Then a sound came from behind the hay bales."Who's there?"he shouted, brandishing the scythe in front of him."Come out!"Silence, except for a gasping and choking sound.Carefully, he made his way toward the noise, his footsteps so soft even he himself couldn't hear them.His gaze trained forward, he walked steadily, expecting to see an animal--maybe some kittens or a cow.Instead, the sight in front of him made his blood freeze.A woman was laying on the ground, her blonde hair splayed across the pile of hay that should have been golden in color, but for the dark red liquid that was seeping into it, dyeing the hay underneath her body a deep hue.Her eyes wide open, blood gurgled from her open mouth and from a large wound on her abdomen as she desperately struggled to draw in breath through the liquid gurgling from her throat.She looked no more than twenty.With a cry of terror, the old man fell to his knees in front of her, his hands shaking as he reached forward to press on the wound in her abdomen, trying desperately to stem the flow of blood.But his hands simply passed through her, even as she stared at him with wide, terrified eyes, the blood flowing faster from her.She should be dead.The thought passed through the old man's head even as he reached out again and again, hoping beyond hope that the next time, maybe his hands would become solid and that he could save her life somehow.Minutes passed.Yet the girl didn't die, stuck in a state of perpetual pain and terror as the old man helplessly watched.Her gaze--distant and drifting everywhere from the pain--suddenly turned toward a point next to him, and she reached out a hand, her gaze then turning to him.He turned to see what she was looking at.The scythe.And then suddenly, he understood.But he couldn't.He had killed some men in his lifetime, but they had been deserving of it.He would never raise a weapon toward anyone undeserving.There was no honor in that.The girl's eyes seemed to be pleading him as she continued to choke on her own blood, unable to live, and yet unable to die.The old man hesitated, then gritted his teeth and picked up the scythe.Maybe there was no honor, but...perhaps there was mercy.He slowly got to his feet, the scythe weighing heavy in his hands.Then with one fell stroke, he sweeped it downwards, and the girl became silent.Her body glowed bright blue before little wisps of light rose from her body, twisting and turning until they became a bright blue orb, which then slowly ascended toward the heavens.It was her soul, he supposed.The old man looked down at the body, with its lifeless eyes and fragile limbs.And then he began bawling, the tears coming fast and furious as he crumpled into a heap on the floor.Day turned into night around him.He stayed in that position until he had no more tears.He had seen death before.He was no stranger to it.But never like this.Never before like this.Suddenly, he thought of his daughter.He had to go see her.He had to make sure she was okay.He picked himself off the ground and picked up the scythe.And in the next second, he was in front of her apartment.She was in the front yard, bent down in front of the resident garden, tending to her tomatoes."Linda," he called out, his voice hoarse from crying.She didn't turn around."Linda!"he called out again.She remained as if she didn't hear him.His eyes dimmed.So it was as he had suspected.I have grown weary.He could see her get married now.Could see her grow old.Death had fulfilled his promise to him after all.&nbsp;

He had become Death.

Who are you? Coras brown eyes narrowed.My name is Luna.IIm not really sure how I got here, to be honest.You can trust me though.I wouldnt harm any of you. The words came out quickly.Even though she knew Cora was right to not trust herafter all, she wouldnt put her faith in a total stranger who was dressed as weirdly as she was.The children dont know who to trust.Theyre children. 

Um, no.I get that.Look, Im just trying to get home. 

Coras gaze dimmed.Where is your home? 

Its She swallowed.Its far away.Im not really sure how to get back. 

Cora looked at her for a second, as if trying to determine the veracity of her statement.Then, she called out, Thomas! 

The door opened, and the little boy with black hair came flying out.A brown pigtail peeked out of the doorway."Yes, Miss Cora?"he asked."Watch the pot."She wiped her hands on her apron and handed him the ladle."I'm going out for a bit.Take it out in ten minutes, and you can give yourself a little extra," she said softly.She rubbed Thomas's head.The small gesture made Luna respect her.Cora wasn't here out of an obligation, but out of love."Yes, miss," he said dutifully.Luna was just about to question whether he would be able to keep track of a pot that was almost his height when he clambered up a stack of bricks that had been arranged in the shape of a staircase by the pot and began stirring.Cora finally turned to her and looked her up and down."Come.We need to get you some clothes."***

Luna scratched at the wool uncomfortably.Cora had gone to a wooden box in the house and had finally produced a dress after a long while of searching.Its all weve got," she said.They headed out right after.The deserted streets of yesterday night gave way to crowded ones.Merchants lined the streets, selling their wares, while people milled about.She took in the unfamiliar sights and smells, pausing every so often to glance at the dyed fabrics laid out or the foods dangled so enticingly in front of her.So at first she didn't notice.Not until ten minutes later, when, even walking down the most crowded area of the street, where others were getting jostled, no one touched her.Or specifically, no one touched them, giving them a wide berth.Luna glanced down.Her clothes were the same as everyone else's, and she had seen one or two people with red hair, so it couldn't have been that strange.Then a woman gave a sly glance at Cora, then dropped her gaze, and Luna's brow furrowed.They weren't giving *her* a wide berth.They were giving Cora a wide berth.But it seemed less that given a social pariah and more...fear?A second later, she received her answer when three men in black tunics stopped in front of them, swords at their side.Her heart pounded in her chest, but Cora seemed more annoyed than scared."Lady Cora," the man in front said, his hood covering his face."Can't you see I'm with company?"Cora said, and Luna nearly shivered.Cora's voice was positively icy.The earlier treatment she'd received was nothing compared to this.It also made her curious.Who was Cora that these men would come for her?The man began reaching into his tunic, and Luna reacted more on instinct than anything else."Careful!"she shouted, and pushed Cora to the side.The man froze, then withdrew an envelope, which he handed over to Cora.Luna's face flamed, and she awkwardly stood there, her face tilted downwards.She had been sure he would draw a dagger.Cora took the letter, then nodded."You may leave now."Then she turned to Luna, and her eyes looked softer than they had before, a chocolate brown."Thank you," she said simply.Luna laughed awkwardly."No problem."They continued walking until they reached a small, dark alley.Water dripped from the thatched roofs onto the cobblestone.Luna wrinkled her nose at the smell of wet hay.Cora confidently walked up to a small wooden door, then knocked rapidly three times.After a moment, it opened a sliver, then slightly more.Cora said nothing, but gestured toward Luna."She's lost her home," she said.The door opened completely.But the shadows outside did nothing to alleviate the darkness inside, and Luna hesitated."Go in," Cora said."I'll come check on you later."She was reluctant, but for some strange reason, she had faith that Cora wouldn't harm her.And that this was her fate.So with large steps, she crossed the threshold to the home.*****

"Mr. Bolton!Please speak with me for one minute!"A man shoved his way to the front of the pack, a small camera strapped over his chest and notepad and pen in hand.He gulped in air as he frantically waved his arms and gazed at one of the most influential men in the world right now: Aidan Bolton.A supervillain lawyer.No.*The* supervillain lawyer.It was an almost unfathomable concept.Aidan briefly assessed the man.Untucked shirt and sweat on his brow spoke to his rush, so he clearly needed the job.The small, amateur camera could mean he wasn't getting paid well, but more likely, it meant the newspaper press he was working for was either failing or just starting up and had no funds yet.But judging by the fervor and determination in which the man was trying to catch his attention--he either wasn't aware or didn't care about the daggers the other journalists were throwing his way--it was more likely the latter.The corner of his lips quirked upwards.Aidan turned to his bodyguard as he reached the door of the large, glass building -- Helman LLC -- said something softly.The bodyguard nodded, then gestured to the journalist who was still heaving large breaths yet desperately trying to catch Aidan's attention."You, come."The man pointed to himself, then glanced around."Me?"The bodyguard nodded, then slid the giant glass doors open just a crack.The journalist's eyes widened, but he didn't hesitate in ducking forward and separating from the crowd and slipping inside.Once he was in, the loud shouts and yells became so muted he could only barely hear them if he actually tried.The inside of the building was dark.Much darker than it should've been for a building made of glass.But the one way glass, tinted heavily, had revealed nothing of the cold, clinical looking setting within.In the center of the large foyer, a completely round marble table sat, and he assumed, acted as the front counter.The woman sitting in the center didn't look up, her fingers clacking away at the keyboard furiously.Her hair was tied up in a strict bun, her appearance much like everyone else he'd met so far.There was a coldness to this place that he couldn't quite shake.A chilliness in the air.The floor itself was white marble as well, and in the large room that spanned probably almost fifty feet across each way, other than the desk and cables that rose past the ceiling, there was nothing else.When he didn't move for another two minutes, the woman looked up at him, and it was only then that the journalist realized with shock that the woman was not in fact a woman at all, but an android.The thins cracks in her face were invisible when still, but when she opened her mouth to speak, they revealed themselves."Mr. Nathan Troy, you may go up to the 157th floor now.Mr. Bolton will see you now."Her voice was toneless, not robotic sounding, but not quite human either.Behind her, a hole twisted open in the ceiling, and a single tube descended from cables, then slid open once it reached the floor.An elevator.Nathan gulped.Did he really want this?Was he about to get murdered?"Mr. Bolton will see you now," the android repeated, cocking her head slightly to the side.Nathan took a deep breath, then walked across toward the elevator, distinctly aware of the way his shoes clacked against the marble.There were no buttons inside the elevator, making it seem that much more like a metal coffin.He walked in, then turned around."Can I--" 

But he didn't get the chance the finish.The doors slid shut almost immediately, leaving him completely in darkness.***

"Would you like to keep your skills?"*Yes.* 

"Would you like to retry the same seed or generate a new life?"Penelope reached toward the 'Generate' button.She didn't want to go back to the same existence.She could still feel the tingle where the knife had penetrated into her leg, slicing through the muscle as if cutting through water, for nothing more than a test of her loyalty to the cause.She could feel the ice-cold iron walls squeezing in around her as she screamed, begging and pleading that she'd be obedient.She could still see her commander's cold, expressionless face as he told her she was decommissioned.The worst part about it was that, when he'd said that, she could only think, "Thank god."No.She had been bred and used as a tool her entire life, and she never wanted to go back there again.This was another chance at life.She could find her way to Eskor.She'd heard rumors that Eskor took in everyone--even ex-members of the Rapture like her.She could live the rest of her life as a simple woodworker, or border guard, or even a Sooi breeder.The point was, she could be completely free.She was free to choose anything she wanted with her life.She didn't have to feel her wrist buzz every hour on the dot anymore, or hear the cold, robotic voice of Sephra in her ear, telling her what mission she'd have to take on next.She didn't have to dread going through the portal again, and the feeling of drowning every time they gave her anesthesia to rearrange her facial features every time they sent her undercover to gather intel from another faction.Never again.Then she thought of Nuko's stricken expression when she had been assigned to the Chamber.Nuko hadn't cried--they weren't capable of that.But the sound she'd made--the wailing, keening cry that sounded so much like a wounded animal...Penelope had never heard anyone make that type of sound before.It had chilled her down to the bone, just before the fog rolled in from the machine and she'd lost consciousness forever.Should she do it then?Not for herself, but for the only other person she'd ever cared about?To try and save her?Right before he'd been decommissioned, Rayan had told her something important.Something big enough to tear the organization down from the inside out.But she'd hadn't had the chance to tell anyone else before the order for her decommissioning, and so the information died with her.She squeezed her eyes shut.Would Nuko do the same for her?Would Nuko choose to relive the same life, spending day after day trapped in different versions of the same hell, for her?She already knew the answer to that question.She pressed the button down hard.*Retry.*

"Whoa, what is this place?"Christie glanced at the trees that towered over them.It was...strange, to say the least.Her horse stomped its hooves nervously, and she lowered a hand into its silky red mane, stroking down its neck gently until it calmed down.Her voice sounded muffled, as if she were hearing it through a door.The sky above them, or what they could see of it, was a murky blue, what she imagined looking up from beneath the ocean's surface might look like.A high pitch whine sounded out from the above them, and Perry whipped around, a low buzz beginning to surround him."Put away your wasps, Perry.You know we aren't allowed to use our abilities like that," Toto said.His shoulders were tensed though, and he nearly jumped out of his saddle when his horse, Lucy, stepped on a glowing plant and its gelatinous innards sprayed everywhere.He jumped down from the saddle and examined his horse's hoof, where the substance had sprayed.Though it still glowed dully, there was no odor, and Lucy still seemed to be calm, so it looked like there shouldn't be a problem, at least for now.Just to be safe though, he pulled out his cane--carved from the wood of the dying tree in the Garden of Eden--and hung it from the little hook on the saddle so it swung from Lucy's side.Within seconds, the plants in a three meter radius around the cane shriveled and turned black.Kevin kept his eyes to the sky, watching the different creatures swim by.Some looked like whales, while others resembled sharks--except with three eyes--and others looked stranger still, peering down at them with tens of eyeballs and limbs, like some mutated jellyfish.The ground was covered with luminescent grass and other species of plants, all glowing in some manner or another.Christie slowly bounced up and down her saddle, then removed her feet from the stirrups.With a small push, she was floating in the air."Christie, get back down," Perry hissed."We don't know whether it's safe or not.""Christie..." Kevin tried to grab at her, his gaze nervously shifting towards the creatures that were slowly swimming through the air above their heads.It didn't help that   

Christie closed her eyes, her hair floating in waves around her as she probed the mind of the nearest creature: a tiny frog-like being with wings protruding from its back.Then, she went after one of the three-eyed sharks.After examining several of them, she drifted back down."They seem peaceful."She turned to Toto."Do you know who we're supposed to find?We're not supposed to wipe out all the species, are we?""Not sure.He only said that they would look similar to a species on earth, and we would know when we found them."Perry huffed."He's always being mysterious.Why can't he just tell us straight up?""I suppose he gets bored."Kevin shrugged."Must get really tiresome if you're all-knowing.""I'm basically omniscient and you don't see me being all secretive."Kevin snorted."Yeah right.Be able to *kind of* influence someone's decisions, and think you're God.Hilarious."Christie shot him a glare."Come on.Let's go."Toto dug his heels gently into the sides of his horse, and it slowly began to walk, though it huffed a little in fear, its eyes wide.After two hours, the landscape still hadn't changed much, but vegetation grew sparse.The luminescent grass had given way to a substance like jelly, and all their horses became restless.Not a good sign.They had travelled in relative silence, without their usual banter, in an effort to attract as little attention to themselves as possible.Before they could do anything--thanks to the fickle god who refused to say anything--they had to gather intel and scope out the place.Toto, who was closest with God and usually knew the most, was just as clueless as the rest this time."Wait, do you hear that?"Toto raised a hand, and they all stopped.They were silent for a moment."I don't hear anything," Perry said.Toto's lips thinned and his brow furrowed, an expression that didn't match his cherubic looks."Exactly."Ever since they had arrived, there had been constant calls and chirps from above from different creatures, yet the world around them was almost deadly silent now.He looked up.Nothing, except the long stalks of...trees?"Wait, guys, those aren't trees anymore," Kevin noticed at the same time.The towering trunks had given way to thin, blue stalks that swayed gently.As the stalks grew upward, they gave way to round, oval underbellies."Oh, they kind of look like a certain plant..." He couldn't remember which one though, no matter how hard he wracked his brain.Especially in times like these, when his stomach was growling, he found it difficult to think.Christie gulped."Guys, there's no wind."She tried to keep her voice as low as possible."What do you mean?"Perry asked."Keep up!"she snapped, louder than she intended."These plants are swaying, but there's no wind!They're alive!"As if to prove her point, the plants around them suddenly became stock-still."Back up," Toto commanded."Now."As the spherical tops of the stalks slowly turned toward them and split into two, revealing sharp, jagged edges and an open maw, Kevin suddenly realized which plant they reminded him of.He gulped.Venus flytrap.They reminded of venus flytraps.And it looked like they were the flies.

You didn't get to where Aerden was through luck."Make sure the troops know that if they desert, they'll be beheaded."Aerden blew away the dust on his arrow, then carefully set it back in the sheath.His eyes, as dark as the midnight sky, glinted as he gave the order to his second-in-command, Nothar."Yes, sir."The young man bowed."And Ocarin seeks to start an uprising tonight.They were discussing it yesterday in the tent.Be sure to send everyone involved a little gift from me."He tossed the pouch toward Nothar, and the man took it with both hands.Although young, he was cunning as well, and he knew that nothing escaped Aerden's eyes.To think of rebellion was insanity.Yet a couple of fools had the thought every once in a while anyhow.Nothar slowly backed out of the tent, and walked across the camp, around all the various campfires and men loudly guffawing over jokes and eating, and headed toward the tent on the far side of the encampment, the pouch clutched tightly in his hand.He wasn't Aerden's right hand man for nothing.He had had to prove himself, over and over again.Trial by fire, then by water.Aerden took no chances, not with trusting anyone.Nothar opened the flap of the tent, then walked in.Inside, Ocarin, a tall, thin man with a beard and a gaunt face, stood up, his shoulders tense.Everyone knew that when Nothar arrived, it was never good news.His slanted, golden eyes came to represent an omen of its own sort: that of Aerden's wish."Aerden wishes to grant you a gift.You may take it with honor."Ocarin's eyes widened, and he fell to his knees.The two men with him did as well, and they kneeled there, heads down.Very rarely did Aerden bestow gifts; it was almost unheard of.The last gift he had given to Nothar was a horse, so swift and so strong that it could gallop across the surface of the ocean without stopping to take a breath.A most prized possession, indeed."We thank his gift," Ocarin murmured, his hands outstretched.Nothar walked close and dropped the object into his hands, then into the other men's outstretched palms as well.Ocarin's brow furrowed when he felt it.It had spikes.He lowered his hands and stared at the object within them.It was of a spherical shape, a ball that was covered with sharp spines, like a porcupine's back.He looked up at Nothar questioningly."Swallow it," the man said, his golden eyes narrowing into slits.Ocarin's eyes widened.This was no gift.It was a death sentence: one that would tear his throat to shreds and cause death in the most agonizing manner.With but a moment of hesitation, his hand shot to the dagger by his side.But before he could even draw it from its sheath, he felt a prick in the front of his neck.He gasped for breath, suddenly unable to take in enough air.He clawed at his throat, but there was nothing there.The other men beside him, too, desperately writhed on the ground, unable to make a sound.There was a reason why Aerden entrusted Nothar with his work.It was because Nothar had a special way with needles.A method of throwing them just hard enough to stick into someone's neck, and the poison on them would slowly cause the throat to inflame, blocking off air.Suffocation was quite a painful way to die.When the tent was finally silent, Nothar calmly walked out."Clean up the mess," he instructed one of the men sitting outside, and headed back toward Aerden's tent to report back.No, Nothar thought.You didn't get to where Aerden was through luck.You got to it through being ruthless and paranoid.And through using the right people.

Sorry for the long wait!I got a little busy with school so because it was a longer chapter, it kind of got put on the back burner.Anyways, enjoy!*****

Why are you crying? The fourteen year old boy knelt down next to the young girl.Her lip wobbled, and she grasped at his fingers with one pudgy hand while pointing to her knee with the other.Scraped and bloody, her knee throbbed.He knelt down next to her, his hazel eyes unusually serious for a boy his age as he looked down at the skin that had been scraped raw.Then, without hesitating, he pulled her up, turning around and letting her ride on him piggyback style, like how they usually did.He was careful to pull her yellow, puffy dress up past her knee so the fabric wouldnt chaff against it as he walked.Then, with careful steps, they headed home.Love you, the girl said, feeling a warmth spread in her heart.She could always rely on him, no matter what.Her arms wrapped around his neck and she leaned her cheek against the back of his head, against his black hair that was slightly warm from the suns rays and slightly damp from the exertion of walking for two people.Love you too, Lizzie.But you have to start being more careful.I cant always be there to help when you hurt yourself. 

She shook her head, even though he couldnt see the gesture.Then she wrapped her arms more tightly around him.I know youll always be there to protect me.No matter what.

&nbsp;

What do we do? The question came out as a rushed whisper.Ardissia just shook her head furiously, her vine whip out and ready.Ive never seen a chimera in game before. 

Lisa took out her dagger too, but the blade looked like it wouldnt even pierce the hide of the chimera, much less kill it.The monkey-head growled as the chimera stalked forward.It was now at the opposing edge of the ring of portals, and they could now appreciate its true size.It stood at the same height as the portals themselves, almost seven feet tall, and its body was almost a third the diameter of the arena itself.The snake-head came forward, its blood red eyes seemingly sizing them up as its tongue flicked out.It extended past the body itself, twisting and coiling to wrap around monkeys throat before resting on the monkeys head.It would have almost been a cute gesture, if it wasnt a murderous-looking monster that probably wanted to kill them.The bird calls from the surrounding forest disappeared.Not even the leaves rustled.For a moment, there was complete silence, the eery type that made the hairs stand up on your back.Lisa held her breath, her body tense.Then the monkey-head bared its fangs into a bloody smile, and it screecheda war cryand pounced.Ardissia and Lisa dove in opposite directions, and the monkeys jawsfull of sharp, crocodile teethfound only air as it clipped where they had stood just moments before.The snake-head whipped its gaze toward Lisa.It lunged.She brought her dagger up to defend herself, but the snake-head never made it far enough.From the other side, Ardissia had swung her vine whip toward it, the end wrapping around the snakes head and restricting its movements.Lisa was barely able to send a grateful glance over to her and clamber to her feet before the snake writhed, easily breaking free from the vines.It then turned its attention toward Ardissia.Lisa had no time to react though, because the monkey was now facing her.It swiped a paw out toward her.She ducked, falling to her knees, and barely remembered to bring her dagger up to stab the paw as it swung past, its raw power creating a breeze that blew past her face.The monkey barely reacted, opening its mouth and chittering in a way that made Lisa believe it was laughing and mocking her.Then it swiped a couple more times, and each time, Lisa would dodge and bring the dagger around, trying to pierce its skin.She glanced toward its paw.It wasnt even bleeding.The cuts could barely be seen beneath the fur itself.Her heart dropped.What on earth were they supposed to do?Ardissia had managed to fend off most of the snakes attacks, but it had still nicked her a couple of times, and there were rivulets of blood dripping down her arms.It was toying with them.Wearing them down until they didnt have the strength to fight back.She was already gasping for breath, and her vision was slightly blurred from the lack of oxygen to her brain.Irrationally, she thought, maybe it wouldnt be so bad to die here.Yes, it would be painful, but then at least they would be out of here.But then again, getting torn to shreds by a chimera was the last way she wanted to go.The monkey slowly stalked towards her, and she moved to counter it, circling the arena.The snake, too, had stopped attacking Ardissia, and now they were side by side as the chimera lazily paced.Have any ideas? Lisa could barely make the question out through her panting breaths.Ardissia didnt answer.Her arms had started to tremble from the exertion, and she was barely holding herself up, the loss of blood making her feel slightly faint.The different colors of the portals didnt help as they rotated, the colors blurring together as they half-ran, half stumbled in a circle.They seemed to realize at the same time, jerking to a stop suddenly and giving each other side glances.The portals.Grasping Ardissias hand and ignoring the way her heart desperately sought to pound out of her chest as they turned to face the chimera head on, she stopped.The chimera stopped as well.Well fight the snake, she said.Her throat parched, the words came out more like a croak.She wasnt even sure if the chimera understood, but then the monkey chittered softly and sat back on its haunches.Good.She swallowed.She held her dagger in front of her, although she knew she would never have fast enough reflexes to block if the snake came straight for her.Watching the snake spar with Ardissia out of the corner of her eye had startled her, not only the snakes speed, but also the swiftness and ease in which Ardissia had used the whip.So it was a good thing she wouldnt need to.Lisa could see the blue glow of the portal just behind the chimera.They slowly backed up, hand in hand, and she could feel the warm wetness of Ardissias blood running down to their palms.The snake uncoiled its body, baring its fangs in a soft hiss.It was now or never.Come on! Lisa yelled, and in the moment when the snake tensed its body, right as it was about to lunge, she let go of Ardissias hand and they dove toward the portal behind them.Go! 

It was a gamble.She landed hard with a mouthful of dirt, the skin on her forearms raw from the impact of her skidding.A large gust of wind blew past her back, and she raised her head just in time to see the snakes head, its mouth gaping wide, streak toward the chimeras body.The monkey didnt have a chance to react before the snakes fangs found its throat.She would never forget the bloodcurdling shriek that came from its mouth as it twisted and thrashed around on its back, its sharp claws tearing away at the snakes body, shredding the leather skin into ribbons.The blood that flowed out was a dark green and came with a sulfurous smell and steam that made Lisa and Ardissia scramble backwards.Wherever the blood touched on the chimeras body, it ate away at the skin.Moments later, the chimera finally stopped moving altogether, tangled in a heap of limbs, blood, and exposed bone, the monkeys eyes empty and glazed as its tongue lolled out.Lisa stood up, then pulled Ardissia up as well.Ardissia blinked several times rapidly before she collapsed back in a heap.Ardissia! Lisa bent down.She reached into her tunic and pulled out a bag, reaching into it.No.No no no.She was out of potions.Desperately, she fumbled around Ardissias clothing.When her fingertips found rough cloth, she pulled it out.Ardissias breathing was speeding up rapidly now, her eyes unfocused.Lisa dumped out the contents of the small cloth bag.One last red orb.She stuffed it into Ardissias mouth.After what seemed like a century later, but in reality was probably only seconds, Ardissias eyes fluttered opened, and she gasped for breath.Lisa felt her own heartbeat finally slow.A good thing, because if it beat any faster she felt like she was going to have heart palpitations.She glanced back over at the chimera, whose body was slowly fading away now, gradually turning transparent and then disappearing altogether.With no sign that it had ever existed, besides the claw marks in the dirt.And as she watched, the portals, too, began to shimmer and fade, all except one.She looked back down at Ardissia, flashing back to a time where her brother had knelt over her like this, his hand holding hers as they waited for the ambulance, her struggling to take in breaths through her asthma attack.Lisa reached out a hand and gently brushed away a stray strand of hair from Ardissias face.Ardissia sat up.Thank you, she said, her voice soft.She wrapped her arms around Lisa, pulling her in tightly.Im so glad were alive, even though dying wouldve gotten us out of here sooner. Her laugh came out wobbly.I think this was it. Lisa pointed towards the lone portal.I think thats the way back.You ready? 

Ardissia nodded, and they got up and walked through the portal together.The other sidethankfullywas indeed the inside of the castle, and the same room that they had left from.On the throne, the king was fast asleep, but upon hearing the footsteps, he woke up.Oh *good*! His eyes lit up, and his rotund body waddled over to them.He looked them up and down, circling them and making Lisa slightly dizzy.Then he laughed, his eyes squished into a thin line as he grinned.*Very* good!Congratulations on completing the *quest*!As *promised,* I will have some *very nice* benefits brought to you. He clapped his hands together.A table appeared in front of them from thin air, and on it lay five different weapons: a sword, a coiled whip, a staff, and a bow, and a set of silver, curved daggers.They walked up to the table.Without hesitating, Ardissia took the whip and attached it to the belt at her waist, then looked at Lisa expectantly.Lisa reached for the daggers.But right as her fingertips were about to touch the gleaming handles, she hesitated.She had thought that Tae-kwon-do would have prepared her enough to face threats.And although these threats were completely fictional, it didnt take away the fact that she had completely and utterly panicked.Maybe she shouldnt go for hand-to-hand combat.She glanced at the staff.Then her eyes flashed.No.She had learned Tae-kwon-do strictly *because* she realized that Kieran wouldnt always be around to protect her.This was the best way to prove to herself that she had grown up.She grabbed the daggers.They were of extremely fine make, the blades as long as her forearm and curved, almost like a scythe.The hilts seemed to be made of bone and iron, an ivory color with a pattern that resembled the scales of a dragon.*Nice* choice. The king winked at her.Those daggers *always* come back to you. 

As she was contemplating what he meant, he snapped his fingers, and two eggs appeared on the table.A *very* special gift from our *priest* for completing the *quest*. 

They were quite large, and as Lisa picked up the one in front of her, it completely filled her palms.And it was magnificent.Hers was a glittering black, with cracks of electric blue down the shell, while Ardissias was the same, except with cracks of green.What are they?Dragons? Ardissia asked.Youll simply have to *wait* and *see.* Now go off!Im *quite* a busy man, and I have other *matters* to attend to. 

Then the king was gone, disappearing towards the door next to the throne with surprising speed.It was then that it finally set in.They had made it.They had completed a huge quest and had gotten amazing weapons, and most importantly, they were still alive.Lisa glanced at Ardissia, whose face was currently split open in a huge grin.And like the teenage girls they were, they dove at each other, first hugging, then jumping up and down excitedly in a circle while holding each others hands.There was nothing more exhilarating.*****

Eliza gasped, her eyes shooting open.She wildly glanced around her bedroom, still feeling her heart pound in her chest.The barbie clock on her dresser.The purple duvet on her bed.And most importantly, the full glass of water by her bed.That meant...Without bothering to tug on her slippers, she raced out of the room and down the stairs.If the glass was full, that meant--she stopped when she saw the brown haired woman in the dining room, setting down the plate on the table."Mom," she choked out, and she opened her arms wide, diving into the warm embrace."Mom, I missed you."Her mother simply laughed, the sound reverberating through her chest against Eliza's ear."Did you have a nightmare?"Eliza nodded furiously.In those ten years of her life, she had run away at the age of sixteen with a boy who was no good.A boy covered in tattoos and who rode a bike.Three years later, when she had realized her mistake and tried to return home, it was to the realization that her mother had died to breast cancer when she was gone.And she had been denied a goodbye."I'm so glad you're here.I'm so so sorry," Eliza sobbed.She gripped onto the apron strings even tighter, so desperately afraid that her mother would disappear.Her mother didn't say anything, simply gently petting her hair and patting her back."It's okay.It was just a dream," she said.She reached into the apron's pocket and pulled out something."Look what I have for you?"Eliza wiped her eyes and glanced at the shiny object in her mother's hand.It was a silver bracelet with a heart charm on it."Do you like it?"Eliza nodded and allowed her mother to put it on her.Eliza's mother bent down and looked her in the eye, her own blue eyes a calm, gentle aquamarine."If you ever miss me, just pretend the bracelet is me, okay?"Eliza looked at her mother, then at the bracelet, and nodded.*****

"Mom, please!"Her mother laughed, even while keeping her eyes on the road.At the age of seventeen, Eliza had blossomed into a beautiful girl, and her mother found joy in seeing Eliza trying to fend off boy's advances.She trusted her daughter completely.And Eliza was glad for that.Because she had made the wrong choice once, and she wouldn't make it again.She clambered into the car and tossed her backpack into the backseat.Then, she brought out the brownie that she thought wasn't that special but her mom claimed was god's gift to earth.How on earth her mother could say that about brownies that came from her school's cafeteria, she would never know, but she bought one for her mother each day anyways.Her mother complained that Eliza was purposely trying to fatten her, but Eliza always simply smiled.Only she knew that her mother would be diagnosed someone within the next two years.Why shouldn't she find any joy she could out of life now?As the engine began to purr, Eliza frowned."Do you hear that beeping?"Her mother looked over at her worriedly."Do you hear it again?""Nothing."Eliza shook her head."Never mind."Over the past year, the beeping had gotten louder.She could never pinpoint where it came from, and no one else seemed to hear it.But now, it seemed almost deafening.A noise she couldn't ignore.And all of a sudden she felt like she couldn't breathe.She gasped for breath, trying to claw at her throat, but her hands seemed to be attached to lead weights.She was stuck, staring straight ahead, as her mother drove on, oblivious.Eliza closed her eyes.She could feel a rawness in her throat, an unbearable thirst."Water," she croaked toward her mother, her eyes still closed.Moments later, a cool rim was pressed to her lips and she gulped in the liquid."Slow down," a voice said.But it wasn't her mother's.Eliza struggled against her heavy lids until she finally opened them.What greeted her wasn't her room or the car, but white walls and a man in a white coat.He peered down at her through his glasses, then glanced toward the life monitor that was steadily beeping."Miss Thomas.I'm so glad you're awake.Do you feel better now?"Eliza blinked."Where's my mother?"The doctor frowned."Your mother?""She was in the car with me.We must have gotten into an accident."The doctor looked down at his pad, then scribbled something.He turned toward the nurse standing next to him."Go get me the MRI results."He turned back to Eliza."You were with a man when you crashed.His name was Jacob Snyder.You weren't with your mother."Her heart dropped.Jacob.That had been the boy.The boy with the tattoo."How...how old am I?"The doctor looked at her, seeming to hesitate before answering."You're 24, Miss Thomas.Don't worry.We'll figure out what's going on.It might be a slight concussion from the accident.You were knocked out for a couple days."Eliza could barely hear him over the ringing in her ears.So she was 24.And still with Jacob.With difficulty, she pulled her left wrist out from under the bed sheets and glanced at it.One after another, tears began to drip down her cheeks, almost uncontrollably, until she was a gasping, sobbing mess, hysterically crying in front of a doctor who simply stood there frozen, completely unsure what to do.There was no bracelet.There was no bracelet, and no goodbye.

So the plot for this part is actually based off of  but because the prompt itself was created from the first part of this story, I figure it works well enough as a part two!*****

"How could you do this?"Oxdar hissed at Lucifer from his seat on the panel."You know cavorting with mortals always leads to trouble."Lucifer stared at his golden-haired brother.That hypocrite.He had knocked up like twenty-seven women and the only reason *he* wasn't sitting here on trial was because he was the golden child and mother had believed in every time when he claimed he didn't even know what sex was."Now, now.We should let him tell his side of the story first," Aena, the Goddess of Harvest, placed a hand on Oxdar's wrist.She was the daughter of Kymes, the God of the Moon, and she'd always had a crush on Oxdar.And before Kassidy, Lucifer had had a crush on her for the longest time.With her gleaming amber locks and kind disposition, she'd seemed like a dream come true.And she had been a dream.Because whenever Oxdar had been in the room, she'd never spared him a second glance.But now he had something real to fight for.His heart warmed.A child.He was about to be a father.Xivorr's gaze flicked up and down, and he sneered at Lucifer.He'd wanted to be God of the Underworld, but his mother, Urra, had been of a lower rank.So even though they had been the same age, he'd gotten second dibs on job openings, and Lucifer had claimed the spot first.He had never liked Lucifer much anyhow."Pray tell how a good portion of Earth is now immortal."Lucifer shifted in the hard wooden chair.They could've at least sprung for a leather one.With a sigh, he began to tell the wonderfully romantic tale of how he and Kassidy had met on one of his usual missions to claim souls and how she'd bewitched him, yada yada yada.Then she'd developed an immortality potion, and he figured, well now that he would never be able to claim her soul and he'd never have to suffer through the awkwardness of seeing her in the Underworld forever after she died, he might as well act on his attraction, which wasn't a crime or else Oxdar would have been on trial long ago.Tara, his closest sister and the Goddess of Freedom, snickered at this comment, and Oxdar's face turned a ruddy color as Aena's face paled."And now she's with child.Completely unexpectedly.But she's been really emotional lately with all the hormones and she just really wanted to save all the orphans in Cambodia after seeing some TV campaign, and I couldn't very well *stop her.* So...it kind of just spiraled, and here we are."Vegdall, the God of Law, had sat there stone-faced for the past thirty minutes as he winded his way through the story, but Lucifer could tell by the way his jaw wasn't clenched that he had bought it.Because for all the talk about not falling in love with humans, it wasn't a hard and fast rule.Vegdall had been the first.And now Detia, his wife, had recently been promoted to the Goddess of Fertility."Can you fix it?"he asked.Lucifer knew the answer he wanted."I can," he said, and Vegdall's expression softened."But I won't.Why should immortality be exclusive to the gods?"he asked, parroting his now very-pregnant girlfriend Kassidy's phrasing.Vegdall was just about to say something else when the door to the Great Hall slammed open, followed by the sound of protests."Goddess Edia, please, this is a judicial matter, and--" The guard turned to Vegdall and bowed."I'm sorry, your Honor, she wouldn't listen."Vegdall waved the guard off, then turned to the Goddess who had just walked in.She was now hundreds of thousands years old, yet she didn't look a day over thirty, her silver hair perfectly coiffed."What's this about my son being on trial?""Mama!"Lucifer's eyes brightened, but he stayed put.Xivorr rolled his eyes.Lucifer had always been such a mama's boy."Goddess Edia, Lucifer has broken the law by dabbling in the mortal realm, and it is our duty to--" 

"Nonsense.You did it too, didn't you?And besides, it was for love.Who out of us couldn't understand that?"No one spoke up.If they did have something to say against love, Niris would have their ears for it.No one messed with Niris.Edia smiled."Now, as the Goddess of Time, I say a little immortality can't hurt if it comes from a good place.After all, a good heart and well-meaning intentions are not something this court was meant to punish, wouldn't you say?"Her tone was light, but it was clear she was telling Vegdall to back down.Then, she lost her facade of calm as she pulled Lucifer out of the stand and her eyes narrowed."And if anyone messes with my future grandchild, I'll make sure they won't want to live forever."And with Lucifer in tow and the jury of ten gods and goddesses sitting there, looking at each other speechless, she walked out of the Great Hall.

When I was younger, I had a pet goldfish."Dwight," my mother said, "that goldfish better not die or else you'll never see another pet in the house."Well, she was wrong about that already because I had been training skunks since I was two to spray into a bottle so I didn't have to buy pepper spray, but anyways.I'm at school.The goldfish dies.What does my mother tell me?She tells me someone stole it."No one steals from a Schrute," I tell her."Did you remember to lock the doors?"She tells me she hadn't.Classic mistake.Regardless, I'm angry now.Someone had the audacity to walk into our house and steal my fish.What's next?The TV?The money I've been stuffing under the mattress?My mother?This has to be stopped.So I find a dojo.I learn Ka-ra-te.For the next fifteen years, I become a master.Purple belt.I go back home to my mother.I'm ready for revenge now.I ask her to think of clues about who had stolen the goldfish.She says, "Dwight, are you crazy?That happened fifteen years ago."Highly suspicious.I go back to my room that's been untouched for the past ten years since I moved out.There is a layer of dust on everything.Everything except the goldfish tank.There is a new goldfish in there.My mother follows me up, and tells me, "I'm sorry.Your goldfish actually died.But I got a new one to keep me company after you left."I don't believe her.A Schrute never apologizes."Mother, you know you shouldn't lie just to make me feel better.I have a thief to catch."I head out.I travel to East Asia.Goldfish is the domesticated version of giant carp from there, so I must start at the beginning.I find a man.He tells me he can sell me a giant carp for $100.I ask him if this is the mother of all carps.He says, "Good breeder.Yes.Ten years old."I go, "Aha!My goldfish died fifteen years ago.Pass."I have caught him in a lie.I find different breeders.None of them know what I am talking about.Clearly I'm barking up the wrong tree.So I head back to America.Back to my mother."Mother," I say."I know you've been hiding the identity of the thief.Just tell me."My mother rolls her eyes.It's a sign of submission in baboons."Fine.Your uncle stole it.He cooked it up and ate it.Happy?""I knew it," I told her.I sprint out of the house.I take a plane to my uncle's place."Why did you take my goldfish?"I ask him when I get to his house."What?"He feigns innocence.But I know he's lying."Goldfish-stealer-say-what?""What?"There's the proof I needed.I knee him in the balls.He falls to the floor."That's what you get for stealing my goldfish," I tell him.I walk away.I grab a beer from a convenience store and down it.It's no beet beer, but it'll do.I watch the sunset.It's a beautiful day.

As soon as Luna stepped inside, the door slammed behind her.She whipped around to see who it was, her gaze darting back and forth, but the sudden darkness had left her blind.Her heartbeat thumped in her ears.What if she had just walked herself into a trap?Just as her eyes began to adjust to the darkness, a small light flickered on towards the back."Welcome in, darling," a voice croaked.A hunched figure sat behind a desk in the back of the cluttered room, garbed in robes that didn't quite seem period, and looked Luna up and down.At closer glance, Luna realized it was an old man.He was hunched over a large map, a quill in his fingers.His hair, grey and frizzy and running down his back in long strands, did nothing to make him seem less crazy, but his brown eyes had a softness to them that reminded her of Cora.Luna glanced around.The room was highly cluttered with various knick knacks on shelves, ranging anywhere from shelves full of rolled up maps to half used ink bottles.Various black splotches covered the earthen floor near the desk, clearly remnants of accidentally spilled ink.Books were piled high on every surface imaginable, creating obstacle courses on the floor.She cleared her throat."Cora said you could help?"The old man turned his gaze back to the map and scratched something else on it."A favor must be repaid," he explained."Who are you?"Luna asked."A curious one, aren't you?"The old man dipped his quill in the ink bottle."I'm a geographer and a historian by trade.A detective by nature.Samuel, by name."Luna didn't bother pointing out that he probably shouldve reversed the order of his introduction for clarity's sake.So where are you from? He pulled out a pair of spectacles from a drawer and put them on, then gestured to a tiny rectangular stool in the middle of the room.She sat down.Um She didnt really know how to answer that question.How could she even begin to explain that she was from a country that didn't exist yet?"Spit it out, girl."Samuel barked."This isn't a difficult question."*Yes it is!* Luna wanted to scream.Her lips thinned in irritation at his attitude.Fine.If he didn't think it was difficult, then she would just spit it out without worrying about whether he would see her as a crazy person then."I'm from America.It was founded off of England's colonies almost three hundred years later from now."She crossed her hands over her chest.He could do with that information what he would.But rather than the stare she'd expected to receive and the snort of disbelief, a strange look came over Samuel's face."America," he repeated softly, and his brows furrowed.He sat back, his eyes shut.Time passed by imperceptibly as he sat there as still as a statue.After a while, Luna sighed.He clearly wasn't going to help.She stood up silently.Suddenly, Samuel's eyes blinked open and he shot out of the chair, startling her.Without a word, he ran to one of the piles of books and began rifling through them, flipping through a couple pages of each book before tossing them aside.Luna stared at his actions in horror.Weren't books really difficult to come by in the old days?And this man was just *throwing* them."Aha!"he exclaimed, then pulled out a small, dusty blue book.He flipped through the pages."What's your name, girl?"he croaked."Luna," she answered.After a moment, he stopped at a page, his gnarled fingers running over the text on it.Luna tried to peer at it, but it wasn't English.Or it was olden English.Whatever it was, she couldn't read it.Samuel froze after reading the text."What does it say?"Luna asked, taking a couple of steps toward him.The book looked impossibly old, its pages yellowed and cracked, and the binding coming loose.But the ink on the pages remained un-smudged, almost impossibly clear.Samuel seemed to snap out of his reverie.His hand shot out to grab Luna's, startling her.Instinctively, she tried to tug her hand away.But his grip, tight around her wrist, didn't allow her to move.He turned his brown eyes on her, the spectacles enlarging them so he looked...quite silly."The Book of Prophecies spoke of this.I thought it was fake.But it spoke of this."Luna was losing her patience."Spoke of what?"she snapped.Samuel frowned."Don't speak to me like that, girl.I'm talking.""Sorry.""...it spoke of someone from the Americas coming to Britain from the distant future.Almost six hundred years in the future."Luna's eyes widened.That was impossible, right?If the book had predicted her arrival, wouldn't that mean that magic was real?Samuel took a deep, shaky breath."I must take you to the King."Luna felt her heart drop.She'd read enough history to know she didn't want any role in politics."Wait, please don't.He'll kill me or treat me really badly.I don't know, just please don't take me there," she begged.Who was the king right now?One of the Henries?"No, you must go," Samuel said without hesitation."It's been foretold."He began dragging her towards the door.Luna fought back and dug in her feet, tugging towards the desk, but the old man had surprising strength for someone his age."What's been foretold?"Even if the book was right, it was definitely just a lucky guess.She wasn't planning on losing her head over it.Samuel suddenly stopped moving, and he looked at her.His expression was deadly serious."The Book of Prophecies names you in several key events in history.You must go.The first event requires you to be by the King's side."The candlelight reflected off of his spectacles, giving him an almost crazed look."The future of England lies in your hands."

"No."Luna stared at her."I was born in the US.I can't be in England.This doesn't make sense."The girl cocked her head to the side."I've never heard of the US.Is it far from here?"Right.The US hadn't been founded yet.She shook her head.Not no, it's not, but no, she didn't want to answer.The girl's head bowed slightly."Well, I should get going.And you should as well.Remember, do you not come out at night."She made to leave, gingerly prying her hand from Luna's.Desperately, Luna grabbed at it again."Wait, I don't have anywhere to go.Can't I stay with you?"At least she knew the girl wouldn't hurt her.The girl hesitated for a moment."Please, I have no family here, and I don't know a single person.My name is Luna," she added, as a peace offering."What's your name?""Anya," the girl answered.She looked Luna up and down, her bright blue eyes piercing.Madame Cora wouldn't like Luna.She didn't like anyone pretty.But a child had just died yesterday, and the orphanage had an empty bed.It would be sufficient, she supposed."Just for one night."Luna thanked the heavens."Yes, just one night is enough."By tomorrow, she would either be awake or she would figure out a way out of this godforsaken place."She followed Anya through the dark and winding streets, taking in the thatched roofs on the houses as they silently walked toward who-knows-where, Anya gently placing a hand on her shoulder whenever her footsteps were too loud.It was truly miraculous.Try as she might, Luna couldn't hear her footsteps at all.Pretty soon, they had reached the building--a run down little hut that didn't look like it was suitable for living.The door was half unhinged, and the straw on the roof seemed half-rotted.But Anya didn't hesitate, merely taking a careful look left and right before slipping inside.Luna followed suit.The inside was completely dark.She was just about to call out for Anya when the sound of a match striking echoed in the darkness, and then the room came into view.The candle Anya lit was just a stub of wax in a bronze plate, but it gave off just enough light to see the shape of lumps under thin sheets, all laid out on the straw-covered floor."Your bed is over there," Anya mouthed at her, pointing towards a corner of the room, where a thin sheet of what looked like knapsack was folded neatly by the foot of a three by six foot space.Just enough room for her to lay out flat.After she'd sat down, Anya snubbed out the candle and headed back outside, closing the door behind her.The room was completely dark once more.Laying down on the straw that poked into her back and listening to the light snoring of someone beside her, Luna stared into the darkness.It would be a sleepless night.&nbsp;

***** 

&nbsp;

In the end, it wasn't as sleepless a night as she had thought.She must have drowsily nodded off sometime--no idea when because there was no light and no clocks--because she woke up to light breathing on her face."She 'as orange haer," a small, high pitched voice piped up from her left."Do you think she's from France?Her clothes are so weird," a voice spoke from the right, right above her head."I 'eard they got real fancy stuffs," a third voice said.Luna's eyes shot open.With a chorus of yelps and the sound of feet scrabbling against hay, the room suddenly became deathly silent.She sat up and glanced back at the culprits who had woken her up.Three faces peered back at her, their eyes wide and their backs pressed against the wall.They looked no more than ten or twelve.The boy on the left with long, brown matted hair spoke first."Who are ya?""I'm Luna," she said.She took a closer look at the girl in the middle, who was clinging desperately to the boy on the right's arm as she stared fearfully at Luna."I'm twenty two."That apparently struck a chord with them because the girl's eyes widened, and she mouthed the words 'twenty two' in shock."Yer quite old," the boy on the right with black hair said."The oldest is Minnie, en she's only thirteen."Right.She really did have no business being here."Madame Cora wants to see you," the boy on the left said, and the other two nodded."She's fru that door."He was missing a tooth, and rather than having the 'th' sound come through as a whistle and be laughed at, he just preferred to place it with an 'f.'"Oh.Who is Madame Cora?"She stood up and brushed off her jeans, noting the way they stared at her jeans and t-shirt with shock and awe."She runs the orphanage," the little girl piped up.Then she looked away, as if she'd used all her courage.She pointed a chubby finger at the back door that Luna hadn't noticed yesterday in the darkness."Thanks."Luna gave her a small smile, then walked through the door.As soon as she was outside, she noted the woman bent over a giant cauldron, stirring it.The smell of beans wafted through the air, and her stomach growled.At the sound, the woman turned around.Luna almost didn't hide her shock.She'd expected an old lady, or middle aged.Not a girl who looked around twenty five, with gorgeous features that couldn't be hidden by the dirt on her face."Madame Cora?"she asked carefully.The woman crossed her hands over her bosom, and her eyes narrowed."Yes, that would be me."*****

I think there was a little confusion about what Kieran was experiencing was a flashback or current, so I just wanted to clarify that it's a flashback to when he was dying.I think part of reason is that I cut the chapter kind of strangely, so when I go back through and re-edit, I'll definitely fix that.Anyways, enjoy!*****

Kieran startled awake.His heart thudded painfully loudly in his chest as he shot up, glancing around wildly.Nothing was out of the ordinary.Large crowds of players still flooded the plaza in front of the castle, some standing still and waiting for members of their parties, others trying the best they could to yell over the din and sell off or trade a couple of weapons.Still others flitted about from player to player, ready to take full advantage of the social aspects of the game.Kieran gingerly sat back down on the fountain ledge and pressed a finger to his right temple, then hissed.It still throbbed with a dull phantom pain, and if he probed at it, it seemed to burn, despite the skin being smooth and unscarred.There were several times during the past two years when he had thought: what was the point of all this?What was the point of living in a fake world where nothing mattered?But the burnt out audiovisual disc had done *something* that left him unable to log out, and unable to die.Perhaps some change in his save file or some corrupted code.Hi, would you like to buy a sword? 

A pair of tall leather boots with curled toes appeared.Kieran glanced up to see a lanky man with spiky black hair and a large grin on his face.A huge bag was slung over his back, and he held a sword in his hand while his wrists and arms hung heavy with different types of bracelets and amulets.He looked at Kieran expectantly.A trader.Kieran shook his head.But the trader didnt give up.Look, this sword will give you +50 attack damage, and it gives you an additional 10% attack speed as an additional buff.Here, look at this gem in the center. 

Im not interested. 

The trader shoved the sword at him.Just take a look!It has a delicate handle, which makes it really easy to 

Something in Kieran snapped.Im not interested! he snarled.He shoved the sword away.What didnt the guy understand about him not wanting to buy anything?It wasnt until he heard a yelp of pain and the grating sound of steel sliding against stone that he looked up.His anger fizzled.The trader, unprepared, had fallen to the ground.His eyes were wide and full of fear as he stared at Kieran.The sword lay a couple inches away from him, the tip covered with small droplets of blood.Kierans gaze landed on the traders sleeve, where a dark red liquid had seeped through the silken cloth.The wound didnt look deep, but it caused a sense of dread to fall over him.He shot up and walked over to the man, reaching out a hand to help him up.The trader squawked and scrabbled backwards on the cobblestone.Kieran stopped.After a moment, he reached into his tunic and slowly drew out a pouch.He pulled out a health potion from inside and held it in his palm, extending it toward the man.The trader hesitated, then took the orb from him, swallowing it.The gash on his arm mended, and the stain went away.He got up and grabbed the sword from the ground, now more grouchy than scared.He grumbled and shot Kieran a glare as he walked away.Kieran stared down at his hand.It trembled slightly.What was wrong with him?In that moment, he had felt an an overwhelming sense of annoyance and frustration.An anger that caused him to lash out in a way hed never done before.Even now, there was only a faint sense of guilt, and that knowledge scared him more than anything.Shouldnt he feel terrible?Was the fact that damage wasnt permanent in the game allowing him to believe violence was more acceptable?He shook his head, clenching his fist.He would simply have to worry about it later.The dream created a sense of foreboding that he couldnt shake.He needed to get to the bottom of this quest situation, and quickly.There was something very, very strange going on.Kieran grimaced.He hated to do it, but he pulled up the chat and sent a message out.Then, with a last glance back at the castle, he teleported to a small pub at the edge of a tiny town called Caerleon.There was only one quest in this town, so it remained largely empty, most of the characters who were walking around NPCs, with the occasional player running around trying to finish the quest.That also made it the perfect place for a secret rendezvous.Kieran pushed open the doors to the pub and strode toward a small round table in the very back.He sat down, surveying the area barely large enough to hold a wooden bar and four to five small tables.Other than an NPC standing behind the bar alternating between idly wiping the counter and just standing therewho wasnt capable of doing much more besides getting players drinksthe bar was empty.Moments later, the door opened, and a man in a suit and sunglasses walked in.He had to duck slightly to make it through the door.To the random by-passer, he mightve looked like a regular businessman in the real world, his blonde hair slicked back and gelled.He walked with a lazy gait of a predator.Kieran eyed him with thinly veiled disgust.The man was a true businessman, and that meant he had a reputation for committing someunsavory acts in order to achieve his goals.Most of the time, that meant trying to progress further in the game through cheating.He was also a former developer for Harkstone, which gave him connections and inside information that he often sold for a certain price.Like now.The business suit itself was one result of a trade that Kieran hadnt regretted per se, but it still left a nasty taste in his mouth when he thought about it.The man walked over to him, his mouth splitting open into a grin that reminded Kieran more of a snakes fanged smile than a humans.Phantom, the man said, referring to Kierans trading name.He extended a hand.Kieran stood up and shook his hand.It was cold and clammy.Nathair. He dropped it quickly.The man simply smiled and sat down on the chair.He leaned back.So what brings the great Digital Phantom to ask for a favor from a regular player like me? 

I need you to find out something for me. 

Nathair languidly shifted in his seat and removed his sunglasses, setting them down on the table.His eyes, a piercing blue with vertical slits for pupilscats eyes that had been a reward for a questflashed.Must be difficult to find if youre coming to me for it. 

Kierans jaw worked.Name your price. 

Nathair laughed, a guttural sound.Oh, dont worry.Im sure itll be nothing for you.But lets just say someone might not like it too much. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So what do we do now? 

Lisa looked at Ardissia, the both of them hesitant.In front of them lay six portals, arranged in a circle.They were in the shape of a door, and a stone border contained each one.In the center of the circle, different from the thorny path full of branches and underbrush that theyd had to pass through to get here, the dirt ground was bare.The portals pulsed.They were almost identical, except for their color.Beyond the circle, the path they had been following ended abruptly.Lisa walked up to one of the portals, this one glowing a light, translucent blue.She tried to peer into it, but the swirling depths made it difficult to make out anything.She glanced over at Ardissia, who was attempting the same thing on the other side.How on earth were they supposed to know which one to pick?Or maybemaybe that was the point.The portals were set in three opposing sets of two.The one in front of her was a light blue, and the one across a light orange.If her guess was accurate, that meantshe sucked in a small breath.Only one way to find out.She stuck her hand through the portal, glancing back toward its partner.Ardissia screamed upon seeing the hand appear from its depths, stumbling backwards and falling.Lisa laughed.Ardissia whipped around and saw Lisas arm hanging through the portal, then clambered up.She glared at Lisa, then stuck her tongue out.A small giggle escaped her.And then they were both laughing.Ardissia took a couple of steps back and jumped through the orange portal, landing by Lisas side.Then they took the blue portal together, feeling slightly dizzy and disoriented from the sudden change in perspective when they came through the other side.Lisas mood lifted.They had had to maintain such a heightened sense of awareness for the past couple of hours, unable to relax for fear of something jumping out at them, and she could tell it was wearing on not just her, but on Ardissia as well.Her face had been slightly pinched the entire time they walked here, her hand never straying far from her vine whip.It didnt make sense for them to be so scaredthere was no real danger to dying here, after all, except for the pain they might experience before that deathbut it was difficult to distinguish the game from real life when the experiences were so acute.Suddenly, Lisa felt a prickle of unease.If the portals didnt lead out of the forest and the trail ended here, what did that imply?It seemed Ardissia had caught on to the problem as well because she was gazing at ground.At the ground that had been purposely cleared of debris.Ardissias hand was suddenly on Lisas arm as she stared in front of them at a spot in the trees, her fingernails digging deep.There, lurking in the shadows of the trees, were two pairs of glowing eyes on top of one another, one red and the other yellow, and they were focused straight at them.The blood drained from her face.The eyes came closer, and Lisa could now begin to make out the pale face of a monkey, its sharp teeth bared.It walked on all fours, a hideous conglomeration with huge lion paws.And where its tail should be, a snake head that lazily undulated its body as its blood red eyes took them in.The monkey made a soft chittering sound, and the snake answered back in a low hiss that made the little hairs on Lisas arms stand up.So this was the quest.She backed up slowly, to try and gain as much distance from the creature as she possibly could.It turns out there was a very good reason for the ground to be cleared.Because apparently it was an arena, and they were the fighters.*****

It as an anomaly.An impossibility.And yet...

Luna glanced up at the boy in front her."You still have 70 years in front of you," she said, letting his palm slip from hers."Really?Then I'll probably live longer than you," he said cheekily, giving her a dimpled grin.She gave him a half-hearted smile, but she couldn't meet his eyes."I have to go," she bit out before grabbing her bag off of the small coffee table and rushing out of the caf.She could barely feel the bitter sting of New York's winter wind as she ran towards her mentor's office.There was a reason Killian had told her to never read palms for people she knew.She shouldn't have disobeyed him.And now she was paying the price.She ran up the steps to the the math building, slipping through the crowd of students."Killian!"she shouted upon reaching his open office door.The man slipped off his glasses and glared at Luna before saying something to the student he was with.The female student slipped past her, giving her a dirty look.Killian was a handsome man.He was never with female students in his office, trying to catch his attention, and at the age of 25, he was the youngest physics professor in the university.Actually, the youngest professor in the university, period.He had also been her mentor since she was just ten.She rushed in, slamming the door shut behind her.She wasn't even fazed when he sent her a disapproving glance, sitting down in the leather seat opposite him that the female student had just vacated."What did you do now?"he asked, settling his gaze on her.She wanted to say that she wasn't always causing trouble, but she clearly couldn't this time."Spit it out," he said."I read Damion's palm," she finally said, sinking into the leather."I'm sorry, I know you said, but he just flipped his palm over randomly and I didn't even mean to!He's going to die.""When?"Killian asked, his voice low and dangerous.Luna swallowed."Seventh century BC."His grey eyes flashed with anger."I told you to be careful.What did I tell you about reading only palms I tell you to?""I know," she said."It should've been safe though," she said, trying to defend herself."There was no indication that--"

"Tell me again."His voice was frosty as he sat back in his chair, crossing his arms."What palms are you allowed to read?"Luna bit her lip, her fingernails digging into her skin."Those that have already been read.Those that are marked.""And why is that?"Killian pressed."Because the future operates like both waves and particles when unseen, which is what gives it the ability to change.""And?"Luna exhaled shakily."And when it's seen, it's set in stone.""So you understand how serious this is," Killion said."You've sealed that boy's fate.""There has to be something I can do for him!"Luna finally looked up, desperate."There has to be.I'll do anything.This was completely my fault!"Killian's lips thinned into a straight line.Then he put on his glasses and stood up."Come with me."&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Luna paused as she came to the sphere sitting on the table, apprehensive.Just a little larger than a marble, it glowed a deep blue, pulsing with a kind of energy that even she could detect, despite her weak training.The rest of the tiny room was dark, so it stood out more.She glanced back toward Killian, who closed the door behind him.Of course he'd be the type to have a secret room tucked away in his office.She would have expected no less of a Time Guardian."What is it?"she asked, pointing at it.His gaze flicked toward her before he walked up to the monitor in the corner--the only other thing in the room--and turned it on."Didn't you say you wanted to save his life?"he asked, his voice monotone.The hairs on the nape of her neck raised.Whenever Killian talked like that, it was always bad news."I did..."

"Here's your chance."He gestured toward the orb."That's a time capsule."Luna's jaw dropped."You're letting me time travel?!But you said you wouldn't allow it for another two years at least!"Killian's jaw worked.He smiled at her, running his hand through his thick, black hair.But it was a dangerous smile."You didn't give me much of a choice now, did you?"he said through gritted teeth."We don't know how you've accidentally managed to change the future, so the only resolution is for you to go back.When was his predicted day of death?"he asked, tapping on the monitor so quickly Luna couldn't begin to fathom what he was doing."March 15th, 606."Killian was about to key in the date when he paused."Gregorian Calendar?"He raised an eyebrow."Julian!"Luna said quickly.Killian was clearly testing her.She exhaled a breath softly at his small nod of approval.This man was so difficult to please."Your job is to keep him alive past March 15th," Killian finally said."I'll be sending you to March 14th.Keep the orb safe.It'll activate on March 15th at midnight."He grabbed the orb and shoved it at her.She could feel it begin to warm and pulse in her hands."Wait, but how to I find--"

Luna vanished.Killian leaned back against the monitor, his gaze expressionless.The Ides of March.All he could do was pray for her success.***

*New?for the first part!* 



*****

Kieran knocked on the door.When there was no response, one hand went on the doorknob, and the other on the handle of his dagger, just in case.*Please come.* 

Those two words rang ominously in his mind.Baduk almost never acted seriously, and he certainly never used the word please.Their friendship went way back, and they were beyond all formalities.What are you doing?Are you breaking in? 

Kieran whipped around to see the two girls staring at him.Im not. His mind blanked, and the statement strangely came out sounding like an admission of guilt, despite the fact that it wasnt.Not at all.And he was just about to open his mouth and tell them that when the door creaked open behind him.The face that appeared was pale, unlike its usual sun-tanned color.Kieran, Baduk choked out.He wobbled, and Kieran stepped forward to stabilize him.Whats wrong? 

I guess they knew I was tailing them.I mean, its not important, nothing in this game is important because its just a game, its just pixels, but it still hurts, and I dont know why Im scared because they cant actually hurt me, but Baduk had been taking in small gasps of air, and it was clear he was hyperventilating.Kieran pressed down gently on his friends shoulders and leaned down so that they were nearly eye level.Breathe. He had his suspicions from Baduks incoherent rambling, but he needed him to confirm them.The softness of his tone reminded Lisa of the big brother she remembered.For a moment, she saw herself in Baduks place, coming home from school, crying about the boys who had harassed her.And Kieran, knelt over her, calmly asking her what had happened.The Myrgs, Baduk made out between small gasps for breath.They came, and they destroyed everything.Look.I dont even know how they got in. He opened the door fully, and it was only then that they could see what he meant.Bookshelves lay toppled over, glass and corks strewn all of the floor from the mason jars.And amid the debris, tiny shards of white, some ground down to a fine powder.The floor crunched beneath their boots as they gingerly walked into the room that looked like it had just exploded.Lisa picked a small, white fragment, bringing it close to her face.It had sharp edges with some smooth curves.Then it dawned on her, and she bit back a gasp.Bones.She looked over to Kieran, but he wasnt paying attention to the floors at all.Instead, he was surveying the walls, and it was then that Lisa noticed the long gashes that dug deep into the wood from floor to ceiling, rending and splintering the planks apart.They could still see the remnants of all the torn parchment on the wall, now an indecipherable mess of paper and ink and string.Are you certain its them? Kieran traced the edges of a gash with his fingers.Claw marks.It could have very likely been the Myrgs.And the only ones who could possibly have motivation to do thisit looked like Kieran and Baduk hadnt been as stealthy as they thought they were.Yeah, positive. Baduk walked over the wooden kitchen table beyond the area of the rubblehis legs were a lot steadier nowand picked up a piece of parchment.He handed it over to Kieran.This was just laying on the table when I got here.

The parchment was in pristine conditionwithout a single rip or tearand on it was the sketch of the Myrg with the crescent tattoo.Clearly, it had been taken off of the wall before they had decided to destroy the place.They had only heard the Myrg being referred to as Vozhak by the others before.In Harkstone, you couldnt go into anyones home without their express permission.So the fact that they had even gotten in in the first place either meant they had connections with a developer inside or they had hacked in.Kierans gaze grew serious.Either way, it meant that they were participating in the public beta too, which meant Baduks home was no longer safe.Whats this about? Lisa asked.Nothi- 

There are a group of Myrgs who have most likely been dealing cocaine, and were trying to prove it. 

Kieran glared at his friend.Baduk blinked.Was he not supposed to say anything?we think, he added meekly.I dont even know what Im talking about.Whos to say whats happening?This game is a mystery, he said quickly, then shut his mouth.No one had ever accused him of being brave, and no one would in the future.Kieran? Lisa turned toward her brother.Whoever they werethese Myrgsthe claw marks on the wall were terrifying.Wait.Were they the lizards we saw in the market?Is that why you were spying on them? 

Kieran sighed.Yeah.But this isnt the top priority right now, he said.Not the topmy home is in shambles! Baduk cried.Kieran placed a hand on Lisas shoulder.Illtry to tell you more, alright?Lets not fight again. He turned to Baduk.I didnt have time to tell you, but the situation with the quests is more serious than we thought.People might be dying. 

Though she hated to admit it, he was right.It wasnt the time for her to stubborn about the issueshe would just ask Baduk about it laterand from way Kierans lips were pressed tightly together, she could tell he was stressed.She had seen that expression often when he was doing research and his team was racing against anothers to publish their breakthrough first.Baduk sobered up immediately.I thought there was something fishy going on.Butdying? He pulled out one of the chairs from the kitchen table and sat down, dazed.Are you sure? 

Kieran was silent for a moment.Not completely sure, but theres definitely reason to believe something strange is happening when people die.Theyre just disappearing.

You dont think its a glitch with the VR pods?Like maybe theyre just dropping from the server? He had picked up a little knowledge about how these pods worked from his time with Kieran.Sometimes the boy liked to talk shop, but he couldnt blame him.He loved tech.Kieran shook his head.If it was an isolated incidence, maybe.But everyone disappeared from the castle quest, and other quests seem to be fine.Theres also the issue with the castle quest not even existing in the first place.Anyways, this isnt something well figure out just by sitting around and discussing it anyway.You should come with us.Were heading to Redwater.

Wait, I heard theres a crazy Sylph there who tells the best tales.People have logged tons of her stories in the chatrooms. Baduk said excitedly, all his previous fear forgotten.Im definitely in.  

It was almost thirty minutes later when they set out, thanks to Baduks insistence that he reorganize his inventory.Not that there was much to organize, Lisa mused as she glanced around the cluttered space.Almost everything had been destroyed, besides a stray plate and cup that sat forlornly next to the sink.Whoever the Myrgs were, they meant business.The road to Redwater took three days, and they encountered a couple of small quests along the way, but nothing serious.They were the type youd expect to find in a normal RPG.Kill ten Banebugs and save the little boy in the forest. Catch a smognare and give it to the hunter by the side of the road. Stuff even Lisa knew were typical quests from her limited contact with video games.So most of the time, they just walked and talked.And because she was busy bothering Baduk, getting him to explain the situation with the Myrgs and trying to learn more about the game in generalinformation he offered up with glee as he talked about the gameplay, bright-eyedthey naturally broke into pairs.Her with Baduk, and Ardissia with Kieran.They walked a little distance ahead.Just far enough that Lisa couldnt hear what they were saying, but Ardissias animated movements and her small hops and skips didnt escape her notice.And when Kieran, at one point, reached out and ruffled Ardissias hair, Lisa felt the bitter taste on her tongue grow stronger.It tasted like betrayal.How could she tell her friend that Kieran wasthat she couldnt

Are you okay? Baduk looked up at her, concerned.Yeah. She walked faster, half-jogging to catch up to the pair up front.She slung one arm over her brothers shoulder, and the other over Ardissias, cutting between them, though she had to lean up on her tiptoes to do it.She had no doubt the low snickers she heard from the group of goblins traveling behind them were directed at her awkward crab walk.So what are we talking about? 

Oh, Kieran was just explaining how the VR pods worked.Did you know they use an electroencephalogramshe looked to Kieran, and the corners of his lips quirked upwards in approvalto monitor our brain waves?Its what they use in the medical community too! Her eyes lit up.Um, yeah.Thats great.Electronic phonograms are pretty coolhey look, can I speak to you for a moment? She pulled Ardissia back, ignoring the side look that Kieran gave her.He probably just assumed it was girl talk because he immediately fell into step next to Baduk.When they were far enough behind that she could be sure Kieran couldnt hear, Lisa turned to Ardissia, but she was staring up ahead longingly.Lisas heart dropped.It was so obvious.And maybe Kieran was aware, maybe he wasnt, but it was still wrong.But before she could speak, Ardissia turned to face her.Isnt he so cool?Like I know you shouldnt like a friends brother just because it gets so awkward, but hes so smart and calm, she said dreamily.Would you be okay with it? She looked at Lisa, her eyes wide, seeking approval.The words she was about to speak died on her lips, like her tongue had been glued to the roof of her mouth.Maybe if she waited, the crush would pass.Maybe Ardissia would realize that Kieran was overbearing and too smart and she wouldnt even have to say anything until then.She didnt have time to contemplate her decision for long because after three days of just walking and camping next to the road in pop-up cabins that they had purchased for a hefty sumin large part thanks to the unreasonable amount of gold they had received from the castle questthey had finally reached Redwater.Ardissias attention was immediately drawn toward the picturesque landscape, and she gasped in awe at the large boulder that designated the towns entrance.Different from Harksdale, which found its identity as a center of trade and had largely medieval architecture, Redwater was a valley town.Surrounded on three sides by mountains whose peaks disappeared into the clouds, most of its buildings were carved from age old trees that climbed up and up, and true to their magical nature, the trunks would turn during the day to face the sun.A large lake in the center served as the main water source for the native populations: dryads and sylphs.According to Harkstone lore, they had found peaceful co-existence after banding together for the War of the Red Waters to fight off Aenos, a blood-thirsty dragon, hundreds of years ago.They had built the town from the scorched dead earth that he had razed.And thus, Redwater was born.At least, that was the version that she had gotten from Baduk.And considering he had spent a good portion of the last couple years of his life dedicated to the game, Lisa was inclined to believe him.*PLEASE GATHER AT THE TOWN SQUARE.* 

The words were suddenly emblazoned against the blue sky, along with a timer that began counting down from five minutes.The announcers voice was a smooth, female baritone.The players around them began rushing through the bouldered gates, streaming into the town.Whats going on? Lisa shouted as she fought to stay where she was.But it was a nigh impossible task, as she and Ardissia were jostled toward the town.She could barely hear herself over the screaming and shouting that had suddenly ensued.Baduk doubled back and grabbed Ardissias arm, dragging them forward so they drifted forward with the current of players instead of against it.His cheeks were a ruddy red now from excitement.Its a random event!These are really rare, they literally happen like once every couple of weeks.The last one was in Harksdale just a couple days ago, so they must be upping the frequency for the beta.Lets go! he shouted.*****

New?for the first part!*****

Ah! 

Lisa reached out at the last second, her hands breaking her fall.She bit her lip, her eyes stinging with tears, as she slowly sat up and brought her palm up, staring at the little flecks of gravel and dirt that had embedded themselves in the small scrapes and cuts.God, youre so useless.It must run in the family.I dont know how your brother won that award when clearly my brothers model was way better. 

Lisa shot up, her eyes blazing.He won it fair and square.Even when Cayden tried to sabotage him and wreck his model. 

The other girls lips thinned.With blonde, curly hair and the soft features of a doll, Aelya had a superiority streak a mile wide.And that streak could definitely ski down the slope of her nose and do a double flip in the air before splatting on the ground, Lisa thought darkly as she glared at the slightly hooked nose that sat on the girls face.She was always talking to her minions about how when she graduated middle school, her parents would allow her to get plastic surgery for it.She perceived her nose as her only flaw.Lisa didnt bother pointing out that she had a slight unibrow as well.Aelya walked towards her and tugged on a braid.Lisa bit down on her lip hard, but she refused to give her the satisfaction of hearing her scream again.She dodged backwards, slapping away Aelyas hand.Aelyas eyes narrowed.Did you just hit me? She looked back at the two other girls who had preoccupied themselves with a ladybug that was crawling on the ground.They both stood up quickly, their eyes shifting nervously, and walked closer.I saw it, one murmured.I saw it too, the other said, her eyes downcast, wringing her hands.They didnt actually like Aelya, but their parents had reminded them over and over again that their livelihoods depended on the girl and they had to do what she wanted.Lisa took an involuntary step back, nearly tripping over a branch.She glanced back.Behind her, the ground sloped down into a stream, and she wasnt really interested in being pushed into it.They were at the edge of the woods that bordered their school.Her gaze shifted behind Aelya, toward the school gates.She hadnt expected to be ambushed here while searching for the injured fox shed found a couple days ago.His leg had gotten caught in a trap, and after binding its wound, she had come here every day since to feed him.Aelya bent down and picked up the pink barbie lunchbox that held the raw chicken Lisa brought for the fox.It had dropped to the ground when she was shoved.The lid was clear, and Aelya snorted when she saw its contents.What are you, a dog? 

Give that back. Lisa stepped forward and grabbed one side of the lunchbox.The fox would go hungry if she didnt feed him.She had even named himAmias, a new French word she had learned from her friend that meant beloved, after the small patch of white fur on his forehead.Get away from me! Aelya yelled, and shoved at her shoulder.Lisa stumbled backwards, the back of her foot tripping over the branch from earlier, and she felt herself fall backwards.For a moment, there was simply the feeling of weightlessness.Then pain, as she rolled down the slope, finally gasping for breath when the shock of cold water hit her.She wanted to get up, but her limbs felt weighed down, as if someone had dropped a boulder on top of her.Moments later, the real pain set in.A sharp throbbing on her leg as if someone had tried to gouge out a piece of her, and aching all over her body.Aelya had frozen on top of slope, not expecting things to get so serious.Help, she finally called out softly, then louder as she whipped around, her limbs flinging wildly as she paced back and forth.Lisa would have found the entire affair funny if she wasnt struggling to take in breath.Her head pounded, and her ribs ached.She could imagine the bruises now, all mottled and purple against her pale flesh.Her mother would go into conniptions if she knew.The thought made her smile, even as her eyelids grew heavier.Through half-lidded eyes, she heard Aelya yell for the two girls to help her while Aelya went for help.Then, a tall shadow in the treeline, who paused for a moment to hear what Aelya had to say before half-sprinting, half-skidding down the slope, yellow and brown leaves flying into the air  like confetti around him.Kieran, she called out softly.His face was tight, eyes hooded, as he gingerly picked her up.She could feel the tenseness in his arms as he made his way up the slope, a sort of tight lipped dangerous aura about him that, for the first time in her life, made her afraid.Perhaps it was the shadows cast down by the trees, but his pupils looked almost black.Aelya stood at the top, stepping in front of Kierans path, her hands wringing.I didnt mean to, she blurted out when they had reached the tree-line.It was an accident. Then, perhaps realizing how out of character her apology was, she added, And besides, she wouldnt have fallen if she wasnt fighting for the box. 

The air seemed to crackle in the silence that followed.Move.Ill deal with you later. 

Aelya involuntarily took a step back, the hairs on her arms standing up.Even when her brother had destroyed his project, she had never seen Kieran like thisa monster from the depthsthe words spitting out of his mouth with no warmth to them at all.Later, she would understand what he meant when faced with a letter of suspension and then her fathers request that she transfer schools.It turned out Kieran contracted for her fathers video game company during his spare time, and between a valuable asset and a daughter who had yet to prove her worth, her father had chosen the former.As it stood, Aelya had gotten off easy.Because just a couple months later, when Lisa was harassed by some boys in Kierans high school, despite his lack of athleticism, he would still manage to break one boys jaw and anothers clavicle before he was taken down, landing everyone involved in the hospital.He was expelled not long after, just weeks before he was to graduate.&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Are we ready? 

Ardissia slung her pack over her shoulder and pulled up the map, examining which path they should take.She pointed to the screen.We can either go down Kols Trail or Whisper Road to get to Redwater.Do you guys have a preference?

Lisa shrugged.Maybe she wouldve had an opinion if one of the trails led them through Death Valley or somethingcontrary to Kierans belief, she wasnt searching for deathbut both path names sounded equally safe.We should take Kols Trail.If you zoom in,he stepped closer and pinched the screen, his sudden presence behind Ardissia making her jump slightly, then blushyou can see that there are a couple of small quests we can knock out along the way, and some merchants later on so we can buy some stuff too. His gaze lingered on Ardissias cheeks that were a little too red for a moment before snapping away.Lisa had mentioned before that she was just like a cute little bunny rabbit.A bunny rabbit with strong powers of observation and quite a high EQ.For the first time, something had piqued his interest other than lines of code and the newest technology.Okay, so were heading out then? The interaction didnt escape Lisas notice.She grabbed an apple from her backpack and chomped at it.It didnt taste quite like an apple, but was rather apple-like, as if the flavor had been created by someone who had a vague idea of what apple should taste like but wasnt entirely sure.She glanced down at the half-eaten apple sadly before taking another bite.Looked like VR tech still had a long ways to go.Wait. 

Kieran had just received a message, and he read it with furrowed brows.Whats wrong? 

He snapped, and the screen disappeared.I need to go check on something.You guys stay right here. Then he was sprinting back in the direction of the plaza, his tall, thin frame weaving and dodging past kobolds and dwarves loitering around, busy trading food and weapons with each other on their way out of the town gates.Lisa and Ardissia gave each other looks.Then they were off, chasing after him, their strides surprisingly in sync as Lisa made sure to keep Kierans tall form within view.They werent damsels in distress, and no way was she letting him get off easy again without explaining what the heck was going on.Not again.*****

*****

Lisa squeezed her eyes shut.She expected pain.Perhaps from the monster ripping her face clean off, or from her body being torn in two.But what she didnt expect was for the wall of vines and branches pressed against her back to seemingly *shift*, twisting and warping like writhing mass of snakes.The support behind her gave way, and she felt herself tumbling backwards.She opened her eyes just in time to see a gaping maw snap shut inches away from her face, its bloated white flesh covered with a slime that seemed almost luminous.Then, the world around her turned completely black as the small opening in the wall closed back up again.She opened her mouth to scream.A hand slapped against her mouth.She could hear the strangers breath in her ear, heavy and uneven.Lisa panicked.She thrashed her body as hard as she could, one hand reaching toward her dagger as the other reached back to blindly claw at the strangers face.Stop.Stop! the voice hissed.Lisa, stop! 

She froze, her breath coming in bursts from the exertion.How did they know her name?Its me!Ardissia! 

Lisa whipped around.She stuck her hands blindly forward, ignoring the sharp ow! that came from in front of her from her presumably poking the persons eye.Her fingertips brushed over their features and came to rest on the small, nubby horns almost hidden in their hair.A soft blue glow suddenly lit up the pitch black, and a soft, olive green face with large bambi eyes came into view.Her face had little spots of dirt here and there, but she looked none too worse for the wear.Lisa suddenly felt tears prick the back of her eyes.She dived forward, throwing her arms around her friend.The familiar lilac scent enveloped her, and she buried her face in Ardissias shoulder, holding her as tightly as could, scared that she would somehow vanish into the wind.I couldnt find you!I couldnt find anyone, and I thought I was going to be eaten aliveLisa whipped around, studying the hedge walland- wait, it cant come through the wall, right?Whatever was chasing me? 

It cant, Ardissia reassured her, her hand lightly patting her back in an attempt to calm her down.Or at least she hoped it couldnt.If she said she didnt know, Lisa would have probably turned catatonic right then and there.She reached out and plucked out some twigs from her hairthe braid was unsaveable messbut she tried to smooth it out anyway.Good. Lisa exhaled a breath, finally feeling some warmth come back into her frozen fingertips.She sat back down.How did you get here?I thought we got separated into individual quests because I didnt see anyone. 

I didnt see you when I got here.I woke up next to a lake, and then I saw this maze and came in. 

Oh. Maybe there were different entrances to the maze then.Or maybe they just missed each other timing-wise.But how did you figure out the maze wall thing? Lisa laid a hand on the wall of branches and leaves that boxed them into a corridor.It felt smooth and cool to the touch, like an actual wall.It was a good thing she wasnt claustrophobic.Although there was plenty of room above them, there was only about an arms length of room across.As it was, their knees were pressed tightly together.Oh!Well, dryads have the special ability to communicate with plants, right?So when I touched the maze wall, it seemed to kind of pulse, so I just pressed a little harder, and it just opened up. 

And you used it to save me.Thats actually really quick thinking.Youre pretty good in dangerous situations, Lisa said.At least, loads better than her.And she had learned a bit of Tae-kwon-do too.Where had that training gone?Oh!Thanks! Ardissias face flushed red, reminding Lisa of a ripened apple.I guess, yeah.Im just bad at speaking to people.I get really nervous around strangers, and your brothers really Her eyes widened, and her jaw snapped shut.Her eyes darted away from Lisas gaze.Um, yeah, I just get nervous. 

Lisa felt a pang of guilt.Ardissia didnt know.She clambered to her feet, brushing the dust off her tunic, and adjusted the belt.Come on, lets see which way to go. She glanced both ways.Each looked the same.Not that she could see anything in the darkness anyway.There was no telling which way she had come from.Just then, her gaze dipped toward the floor.There seemed to be a pattern.She bent down, brushing away at some of the dirt.Interlaced rectangular blocks.And even by the dim light, she could tell they were a pale yellow.So thats what the girl had meant.In between, indeed.Who wouldve guessed she meant in between the hedge walls?Well, that made their job easy at least.It wasnt long before they found the basket, overflowing with rhododendrons, poenies, and amaranth.When Lisa handed the basket back to the girl, the girl thanked her profusely before skipping into the maze.Wait! Lisa shouted.She ran after her just seconds later, but the girl had disappeared.She looked left and right, unwilling to step foot too far into the maze even though the quest was complete.Although it was day now, the sky a clear blue laced with wisps of white clouds, she couldnt erase the image of the monsters gnashing teeth from her mind.She turned back around, and her eyes widened.Ardissia, seeing her strange reaction, turned around too.She involuntarily took a step back, nearly bumping into Lisa.She reached a hand back, grasping Lisas hand in her own and squeezing tightly.What had just seconds earlier been a wheat field was now the forest, a mass of trunks and branches and leaves that seemed to reach toward them.Impossibly, the trees towered higher than before.And in front of them, just as earlier, the branches interwove to create a space in the shape of a portal, beckoning them to enter.Sothis is probably the next quest, huh? 

Yeah 

Okay, lets justwalk in on three? 

Lisa nodded.It looked like they didnt have much of a choice in which quest to pick after all.&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Young sir!Would you like to try your luck at mining?  

An elf, dressed rather cartoonishly in a green tunic, leggings, and an oversized pointy hat, beckoned him closer.. His face was pointed and pale, with an intricate tattoo in a crescent shape, wrapping from just above his eyebrow to his cheekbone, and that of a large dragon covering his rather skinny arms.Kieran squinted up towards the snowy path.It would probably be another half day before he reached the peakhe had to bring a parcel up as part of his questbut there wasnt any rush.He peered into his inventory.He was running low on gold, and bloodstone and black opal always sold for a high price.Alright.Ill bite. 

Id love to go down into the caves myself, but unfortunately, Ive left my pickaxe at home!Ill let you access the caves if you agree to bring me back 5 Amethysts.Youll find them deeper in the caves. 

Sounds good. Kieran grabbed the pickaxe and an ever-bright lantern from his rucksack and headed in.The cave walls glittered, the lanterns glow causing multi-colored streams to light to scatter about the cave.The entrance of the caves tended to have more of the commonly seen minerals: silver, copper, and iron, with specks of gems and other more valuable minerals strewn across the walls.If you wanted the better stuff though, you had to go deeper.Into the belly of the beast, where monsters lay.Kieran adjusted the straps of his rucksack to stop them from sliding down his shoulders.Then he headed in deeper.A couple minutes in, the walls grew more colorful, the deposits of gems and more valuable minerals beginning to show up in abundance.He glanced around at the large cavern he had entered.Stalactites hung from the ceiling, rivulets of water dripping from their tips onto the ground below.In the center of the cavern, a pool of water had formed from the angled slopes of the ground itself.It would be a good starting place.There was only one other entrance into the cavern, and it was directly across from him.Alright.Easy enough to defend on monsters.He had ten slots left in his inventory, so he would simply fill up with as much as he could in a couple hours time and head out.The amethyst deposits on the wall glowed a dark purple.He dug out the five he needed for the quest first, then started in on his own collection.Moments later, as he hacked away at a deposit of bloodstone, he paused.A low rumble echoed through the cavern, and the tiny shards of crystals and rocks on the ground began vibrating.He dropped the pickaxe and his rucksack to the ground, then opened up his inventory.He tapped on a slot in the weapons tab, and a bow appeared in his right hand.Reaching into the quiver slung around his waist, he pulled out an arrow and drew the bow back, aiming it toward the opposing cave entrance.Whatever it was, it was large.He stayed silent, crouched against the wall, his eyes locked on the caves opening.The rumbling continued.Wait.If it were footsteps, shouldnt the rumbling be at intervals?Just then, a stalactite broke loose from the ceiling, crashing down and shattering into thousands of pieces.Kieran managed to raise an arm to shield his face, but the stone shards cut into his arm, tearing through the thin cloth of his sleeve.He hissed in pain.But there was no time to waste.He grabbed the rucksack and the lantern, heading back toward the cave entrance.A large chunk of cave wall broke off, landing inches in front of his face.And effectively cutting off his exit.Shit.He whipped around, sprinting toward the other entrance, forcing himself to stay calm.He had never heard of a cave collapse incident before in game, so that probably meant the incidents were relatively contained.If he could get to the other rooms, maybe he could 

A large weight crushed onto his back, and he collapsed.A searing pain swept from his spine to his back of his head.It felt like someone was gouging at his brain.He screamed.The pain was unlike anything he had experienced before, a white hot, blinding pain like lightning shooting into his body.And a searing burn on one side of his temple.Even through the haze of the pain, he realized something was very, very wrong.He clawed at his right temple, trying to remove the small round disc that fed the audiovisuals of the game into his brain, but his body wouldnt listen, his fingers shaking uncontrollably.It felt like a current, running through his body.*Im dying.*

*New?First part !*



*****

Im sorry, Kieran said awkwardly.He ran a hand through his hair, pacing back and forth.Its just that its always been my sister and I, and she means everything to me.Im not really great with wordsbut youre important as well, and I shouldnt have said those words.Youre right.We should help. He sighed, his boot scuffing at the branches and vines that twisted together to create an almost smooth floor.I forgive you. 

He jumped, whipping around.Ardissia stood at the open door, a delicate arm leaning on the doorframe, while just Lisas head peeked through the entrance.Lisa grinned at the crimson stain that spread over Kierans face before ducking under Ardissias arm and making her way in.You really shouldnt keep the door open, you know.Eavesdroppers is quite a problem these days.Theyre everywhere. 

Noted, Kieran said, with a hint of sarcasm.He averted his gaze, sitting onto his bed, pulling his legs up onto the bed and tucking them under him.They had tracked Kieran using the map, thinking it would be relatively difficult to find him.But they had bumped into Baduk right underneath the huge tree, almost passing it by without realizing it was a building.The entrance hadnt seemed like much of an entrance at all, more like carved out portion of the trunk.But when they had walked closer, it turned out the path spiraled into the trunk, and into the magnificent inn that was five stories high.Lisa glanced around the room.It looked identical to theirs.Almost everything was made out of interlocking branches and vines, from the table to the dresser, and indeed, the branches wove straight into the table and chair legs, turning the furniture into permanent fixtures in the room.When they had checked in for the night, the innkeeper had assured them thatif they should be so inclinedthey could always ask for a different placement for the furniture, and she would be happy to oblige.Different from the tight interweaving pattern of the floor, the vines overhead hung from the ceiling in low arcs, mimicking a canopy.Besides a small, circular window that faced the lake, the only other light in the room came from the luminous leaves dotting the vines, glowing a soft green.Ardissia sat down on Baduks bed, and moments later, Lisa joined her.So do you guys have a plan for tomorrow? Kieran asked.His shoulders relaxed when he noticed the way Ardissias lip curved upward slightly at his question.We were talking on the way here, and it wouldnt really make sense for Mehluni to give us the chance to solve this case if there wasnt an actual culprit.Thats originally why I wanted to help out, and thats why Ardissia stood forward too. Lisa explained.Kieran nodded.Thats what we thought as well.We were 

Aha!So you admit we were right when we stood up for them! 

Kieran ignored her.We were thinking of talking to the Sylphs tomorrow and checking out the lake. 

Same.So do we want to split up?Me with Ardissia and you with Baduk?We can grab breakfast, then split up.Well go check out the lake while you interview the Sylphs?

Sounds like a plan.   

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Ardissia glanced backwards, then again.The third time, she nearly tripped, barely catching her balance by grabbing onto Lisa arm.What are you doing? Lisa asked curiously.Do you she glanced back again, her gaze scanning the groups of sylphs and dryads walking all around them.Do you feel like were being watched? 

Lisa glanced around, meeting the gaze of a sylph with light blue skin and sharp features.His eyes narrowed, and he said something to his companions, who both stopped in the middle of the busy road and turned to stare at them.Slowly, other groups turned to stare as well, some curiously, others with expressions of disgust.She involuntarily took a step back, then turned around and walked faster.Their inn was rather secluded, lying to the west of the town square.Earlier while taking breakfast, theyd asked the tavernkeep where they could start investigating, and the dryad had stated that there were quite a few sylphs living by the lake to the east, albeit with a surly expression, and only after they had paid him some extra gold.So it was when they passed the town square that they finally understood why they had been the recipient of so many glares.A small crowd was gathered around the square, and they squeezed their way inwards.A wooden board had been erected in front of the giant oak overnight, and on it, eight sketches had been posted.The four of them, and the dragomirs.And an accusation underneath that claimed they poisoned the lake.Lisa felt the sylphss stares burning into the back of her head as they left.It was early afternoon before they saw the cabins.Lisa could see their inn on the other side of the lake.Several dryads and sylphs were outside, drying clothing on racks outside, but just as Lisa and Ardissia made to walk up to them, one of them looked up and made eye contact with Lisa.Lisa smiled and waved, but the dryad averted her gaze, speaking something quickly to the rest of the group, and they all rushed toward their respective cabins.Lisa lowered her hand.Maybe I shouldve hidden or something.I think they recognized me, she said awkwardly, turning toward Ardissia with a sheepish smile.I dont think it would have made a difference. Ardissia patted her shoulder.Come on, lets go check out the lake. 

The putrid smellsulfurous and reminiscent of rotting eggs and skunkwafted towards them as they neared the water.Lisa nearly gagged as she pinched her nose and walked closer, her footsteps disappearing into the reeds that grew almost a foot long, right at the waters edge.Further out, towards the center of the lake, the water was still a light blue-green, but the outer depths were a brackish brown color, streaked with red, as if someone had mixed red paint with clay and dumped it all into the lake.There were also fibrous clumps floating on the waters surface.Ardissia wrinkled her nose.No wonder. 

After a while of wandering around the lakes edge, they hadnt found anything of useonly a discarded cauldron and the ashes and burnt logs from what was once probably a campfire.They did, however, discover a clearing just a little ways off the main path around the lake, covered in gorgeous, bright pink blooms.They each picked a handful and danced through the field of flowers, giddy with excitement.With the bright blue sky and snowy-peaked mountain as the backdrop, it was easy to forget that there was a task at hand.They set out back for their inn not long after, Lisa constructing a flower crown for Ardissia that she wore with pride, despite some of the stems being lopsided from being folded inaccurately so many times.It turned out Kieran and Baduk hadnt had much more luck.Their status meant doors were slammed in their faces wherever they went, and when doors werent being slammed, buckets of dirty water were being poured.Lisa laughed when Baduk complained about the unfairness of it all, and Kieran simply rolled his eyes in fake exasperation at Ardissia, who giggled at his antics.Dinner was a sad affair, partly because of the lack of progress, and partly because although Lisa loved the many, many fruits that they had eaten for breakfast and lunch, even the prickly pear pie was beginning to wear on her.She longed for a juicy cut of steak, and she could tell Kieran was too from the way he picked at his bobbed applea concoction where the chef carved out the inside of an apple and stuffed all sorts of different fruits inside, from kiwis and grapes to razzlepuffs and cizelons.After dinner, they discussed plans for the next day.Turns out there wasnt too much to do except try to cover ground they hadnt alreadyKieran and Baduk had covered a good portion of East Village where they lived, so tomorrow they would fan out and try West Village while Kieran covered the rest of the east side.Halfway through the meeting, Kieran noted that Ardissias face looked pale, so they ended up turning in early.It was almost midnight when Kieran awoke to frantic knocking at the door.Baduk sat straight up at the commotion, shouting gibberish.When he opened the door, it was to Lisa, her eyes wide and blinking frantically.Her forehead was beaded with sweat from the effort of dashing up three flights of stairs.Theres something wrong with Ardissia, she whispered.I dont know whats wrong with her, please, Kieran, help, please.

"Which one of you is Alam?"Meena calmly examined one of her nails and pulled out a nail file.Tiny specks of glittery red dust drifted to the floor as everyone looked at each other.No one spoke up."Don't make me ask again," the girl said, her coal-rimmed eyes narrowing into slits, even as she blew on one of her nails that had now been filed into a point with blood-red lips."You're not going to like it."Finally, a skeletal figure stood up at the back of the tavern, his bones clacking together as he nervously shuffled forward.A space opened up where he walked as everyone backed away, unsure what was happening.No human should've been able to come in.After all, this was the underworld, and the Undertaker personally manned the portal in."I'm Alam."The skeletal figure stopped when he reached the front of the crowd, unwilling to walk too close to the enigmatic figure."What do you want?"The question came out as more of a choke, partially as a byproduct of not having vocal chords.Their voices were given to them by the Undertaker as well, and he wasn't one to focus on the details.The Undertaker specialized in *big ideas.* 

"Oh, I don't want anything," Meena said.It was the first time she'd been assigned to the underworld--usually she preferred tasks in the mortal realm because humans were so much easier to deal with--but she'd lost a bet with Sam."But there's someone very special who does.Gabriel has asked for you."The skeleton's face blanched--if that was possible."Gabriel?What does an archangel want with me?I've already been assigned to the underworld!"It wasn't a bad existence here; the underworld was often caricatured as a horrid place, but once you got to the part where your flesh rotted off your bones, the Undertaker started seeing you as one of your own.The issue really was that if you hadn't completely decomposed, there was always a shred of hope of being reincarnated.Or something along those lines."Hey, don't ask me.I'm just the messenger."She walked up to the cowering skeleton and placed a hand on his shoulder."You think I want to be here?"She had a love-hate relationship with Gabriel.He was the one who saved her, yes, and gave her immortality, but she was also destined to be his lackey for eternity unless she found a way out.Well, that, and they were lovers.On again, off again.Whatever."Come on.Clearly you've been a naughty boy, or else what would the angel of life want with you?"She gave him a smile less reassuring than terrifying, and as quickly as she had appeared, she was gone.Only the faint scream could be heard as they vanished, with no evidence that they were ever there.

From here on out, this story will be renamed The Forest!So sorry for the late update, with graduation things have been insane.Unfortunately, the next month isn't looking much better because I'll be traveling all month.But I'll definitely try and do as many updates to this story and DP as possible, alternating between the two!*****

I thinkyou should rethink this. Cooper chose his words carefully.If there was one thing to be said for Libby, she made brash decisions more often than not.We have to figure out whats going on though.Arent you curious? Her eyes were bright, andnot for the first timeCooper had to wonder if she actually relished the situation they were in.He hesitated.Cooooppppeerrrrr. 

He sighed.Fine. 

Libby broke into a huge smile.Lets leave at 5 a.m. tomorrow.Same packing arrangements as always? 

Cooper nodded.Whenever they went camping, Libby would be in charge of the food, and Cooper of the tent and whatever other essentials they might need.And dont forget the garlic, he added after a moment of thought.Libby sniffed.I dont know It wasnt like they were trying to fend off vampires, so why on earth would they need garlic?Then she shrugged.Whatever.It couldnt really hurt them, so it wasnt worth debating over.Better to be safe than sorry.Alright. 

She said goodbye to Cooper and opened the front door.The second she stepped foot into the house, her mother appeared, nervously wiping her hands on her apron.Libby, where have you been? 

Just out with Cooper. 

You havent been talking about the commandment in public again, have you? 

No, of course not, ma. Libby pried off her boots.She knew she wasnt the best kid.Her mother was constantly worrying for her safety because she was always getting into troublethis wasnt her first time upsetting the townspeople because she couldnt watch her mouthand so her mother was constantly apologizing to them.And she hated it.She hated that she couldnt seem to stop herself, and she hated that her mother had to look meek in front of Bradford, who always had that nasty, leery look about him.Libby walked up to her mom and wrapped her arms around her.Mom, dont worry.I can take care of myself. 

Libby Her mother gave her that expression that meant she didnt believe a word that came out of her daughters mouth.Then she took a step back and scanned Libbys eyes.I just dont want you to do anything rash.Youre always getting into trouble. 

Libby averted her mothers gaze, feeling a pang of guilt hit her.She tamped it down.Mama, you know Cooper would stop me if it came to it. 

A small smile appeared on her mothers face.That boy protects you like nothing else.You know he likes you, right? 

Libby felt her heart stop for an instant before it restarted.No, mama, he doesnt.You know he went out with Shelby just last year.Were just friends.Im like a little sister to him. She didnt let herself dwell on how the words tasted slightly bitter on her tongue.&nbsp;

Ready? Libby pulled the strap of her backpack up further.She had nearly gotten caught making the turkey and cheese sandwiches so shed made a couple fewer than she liked to.She had to make do by stuffing as many granola bars as she could fit into her backpack instead.Then there was the canned tuna, the extra bread, the carrots and celerywhich Cooper wasnt the biggest fan ofand the dehydrated fruit.Shed left a note on the fridge, telling her mother that she was going out camping with Cooper for a couple of days, just on the other side of town right along the forest.Theyd done it a ton when they were youngerher mother had insisted that it would be the closest they would ever get to an adventureso she probably wouldnt be too worried.Ready. Cooper took a deep breath and swiped at his hair.They ducked through the backyards, heading toward the only road that led out of Wolford.Most of the roads in the town were dirt roads, except the main one that cut straight through the center of town.So if they followed it, it would lead to a highway, which would eventually lead to New York City.A small wooden barrier had been set up across the road just on the towns edge, with a large metal DO NOT LEAVE sign propped against it.Libby simply ducked under it, and Cooper followed after a moment of hesitation.The sun still hadnt risen over the horizon, the sky still a murky, dark blue, and the fog was thick before their eyes.It lent an eerie quality to the air, and Libby involuntarily shivered as their steps made a soft pitter pattering sound against the black tar of the roadthe only sound they could hear.They could barely see several feet in front of them.Libby inched closer to Cooper, her eyes scanning the darkness.Both sides of the road were surrounded by forest, and the tree-line seemed to swallow the road in the distance.There was something unnerving about the trees that towered over them, their branches reaching out.Do you-do you have a weird feeling in the pit of your stomach? she asked in a hushed tone.Shed only ever driven through here by car, though the next small town was technically close enough to walk tosimply an hour and a halfs walk away.Coopers lips thinned for a moment, his eyes sharp as he focused on the road ahead.Finally, he gently took her arm and pulled her closer to him.Yeah.Listen. 

Libby blinked.She placed an arm in front of Coopers chest and paused.They listened to the darkness, but in place of the usual bird calls that shouldve been present close to dawn, there was instead nothing.Complete and utter silence.Lets just go quickly.This was a bad idea, Libby mumbled.It would be worse turning back.They had been walking for close to an hour now, and the next town was almost within sight.She fought the urge to run, and instead sped up the pace, focusing on making her footfalls as soft as possible.Eventually, a sliver of sun peeked over the horizon, lightening the fog just enough for her to stop in her tracks.It was impossible.She walked faster.No.It shouldve been 

She turned to Cooper, whose face showed a similar expression of disbelief.In front of them, the road simply ended.And in its place, tall, looming trees that seemed like theyd been there for centuries, stretching as far as the eye could see.*****

"Long time no see, Kevin."Christie grinned."I see you've only gotten more rotund."Kevin shifted on his horse, its coat sleek and dark as the midnight sky, trying to get more comfortable."Hey, girl," he responded, giving a side eye to the girl whose horse was blood red."I see you haven't given up on your fat jokes, huh?""Oh, come on!You've gotta admit it's funny!"She tugged down on her crop top, then glanced toward the portal."Where are the others?""You know Perry's always late," Kevin said, then glanced toward the sky.One sun hung low in the sky, while the other was almost above their heads and was almost an electric blue, casting everything in a neon light.Here, time didn't really flow correctly, but he supposed there was no need for it to.They sat on top of what appeared to be a sand dune, but you couldn't particularly trust that again either.Nothing was real here.His stomach grumbled again, and he pressed a chubby hand to it, pressing it inwards.A pity his power couldn't help him now.It was moments later before a teenage boy with a checkered button down shirt, pressed trousers, and loafers appeared through the portal."Hello guys."He peered around, then urged forward his horse, whose coat was as white as the smooth stones at the bottom of the river.He wrinkled his nose."Why'd we have to meet here?It's so dirty."He brushed a dead insect from his shirt, then joined them.Christie blew on a fingernail."You'll have to ask Toto.He was the messenger."She then pulled out her cellphone and began to text, her long red fingernails clicking softly on the screen."Don't know why we're meeting up anyway.Haven't even met up since the first seal was broken, and that's how I prefer it."Kevin chuckled."Oh, those were good times."He shifted, then finally pulled out a bag of chips he'd hidden away in the small pack on the side of his saddle.Christie laughed."Don't you feel ashamed?So many little boys went hungry because of you."Kevin shrugged."How do you think I stay fed?"Perry rolled his eyes."Right.Starve the world just to feed your ass."Kevin bother responding through a mouthful of chips.He'd known the two for longer than he could remember, and they were always joking around.He tossed a couple toward Perry."Hey!Watch it!"Perry shouted, ducking.He brushed the crumbs off of his shirt, then glared at his long-time friend.Kevin shrugged.Perry was always trying to stay as clean as possible.Pretty ironic, considering his ability was to create bugs that transmitted disease.And they always laughed at him for his ability.Finally, the portal glowed again."Oh, thank god," Christie muttered, then tucked away her phone.The small boy who appeared through the portal grinned at them."Hey guys!Long time no see!I've missed you!"Kevin fake-gagged, while Perry simply pushed up his glasses.Toto chuckled, then drove his horse forward.The ashy grey of its coat nearly blended in with the sand.If there was any irony to be found, it was with Toto.With blonde hair and plump cheeks, the boy looked like he should be advertising baby shampoo or something."So why have you called us here?"Christie crossed her arms over her chest."I was just having fun.""Yeah, now that Trump's in charge, I'm sure you have plenty of it.You're probably just whispering in his ear to drop a bomb on China.""Hey!"Christie snapped."It's not my fault that guy's mentally weak.What am I supposed to do, just not take advantage?""Guys, please," Toto said, raising a hand.They all looked toward him."I know you guys have been doing your own thing for the past thousand or so years.But Perry, you can't be hanging out in the crops anymore, and Kevin, I'm sure you're sick of slumming it out."Then he glanced up toward the sky.The timing was almost right.In a couple minutes, the suns would be correctly aligned."Okay, look.I don't have a ton of time to explain this, but we have a new assignment.A planet that's just blossoming called Iaria, and they're kind of in the stage where they'll need some population control soon."Kevin rubbed his hands together."Ooh, that sounds fun."Christie thought about it for a moment."Yeah, I would be down to take an assignment somewhere else.Earth is getting kind of boring anyway.Thanks, vampie."She pulled out her phone again and turned it to selfie-mode to make sure her makeup was in place.She wouldn't make the same mistake she'd made with the Emu War.The new planet wouldn't laugh when they thought of her.Toto leveled a hard stare at her."Stop calling me that.""Besides not glowing, you kind of hit the rest of the requirements.You ever tell God how you stay so youthful?"Toto simply sighed."Come on, guys."Then he turned around and spurred his horse on, flying through the portal.The rest of them quickly followed suit.*****

"Get it out of my face, you monster!"Kennan smacked at the enormous jell-o blob Eliza had shot at him."Well, maybe I would if I didn't constantly find *grasshoppers* in my bed!"Eliza shouted, lobbing another stream of jell-o at him, until he was covered in all different colors of the bouncy, viscous material."Guys, please, we're here to talk to Gus.Can you stop fighting for just one second?"Marlene rolled her eyes, and with a snap of her fingers, a giant spring appeared between the two heroes who were about to lunge at each other.Instead, they bounced off the spring and shot backwards.Marlene shot Ben a look.He glanced up from his book for a second before looking back down.Seconds later, cushions appeared under the two, right where they fell.A small click, and the door leading towards the bedroom opened just a sliver.Kennan and Eliza stopped fighting, clambering off the pillows and standing at attention in a row with the other two, ready to--in a certain sense of the word--meet their maker."Gus!"Marlene exclaimed, as the door opened wider and a grey haired old man shuffled out in his Donald Duck pajamas."You called for us."She was met with a grunt as Gus headed toward the kitchen.He poured himself a cup of coffee, then shuffled back into the living room, where the four of them still stood.He gave them a side eye."What are you guys doing here?"Kennan's brows knit together."You told us we had to save the world and gave us these powers, then *dumped us* in Antarctica and told us to come find you, and this is all you have to say for yourself?!"His voice gradually became more and more high pitched as he spoke.Gus sniffed, then looked at the four of them."You guys don't look any worse for the wear.""That's only because we went home first and changed."Eliza rolled her eyes.Gus took a slow sip of the coffee, the only sound in the room the long, steady sound of his slurping as he took in the four teenagers that stood in front of him.He'd had no choice.The threats only loomed larger, and he could no longer create superheroes the way he once could.His imagination was beginning to fail him, and his options were running out."Go out, git," he said."I can't help you.""What's the threat even?What are we supposed to be doing?"Ben asked.Gus stared at him for a moment, his expression blank.Then he shrugged his shoulders.He was old now, and tired.He'd saved the world more times than Spiderman, Batman, and Superman combined.In fact, he'd given them their powers."I don't know," he said."Go ask someone else.Go watch the news or something."Then he walked back into his bedroom and closed the door.What did they want from him?He'd already given them everything he could.His superpower wasn't knowing what the threat was.It was merely preparing for it.

*"Would you like to join the Rapture, girl?"The cold voice sliced through the air, each syllable punctuated precisely.*

*Penelope shook her head furiously.She sucked in gulps of air, tears running in rivulets down her face as her entire body shook.She turned her head away from the sight of her parents' dead bodies, staring instead at the ground, where splatters of blood coated the petals of the flowers her mother had worked so hard to grow.* 

*She was jerked upwards by her throat.She thrashed about, trying to break free, her hands clawing desperately at the woman's arms, but she couldn't find purchase on the smooth, metallic surface.Right when she thought she was about to die, the woman let go, tossing her to the ground."Let me ask you again," the woman said, her eyes cold.Her blonde hair was pulled back into a severe bun, her features almost inhumanly perfect as she stared down at Penelope."Would you like to join the rapture?"* 

*Penelope's hands went cold and her lips trembled.She stared at the dagger that the woman played with so loosely in her hand, the way she flicked it upwards into the air and then caught it again without any heed for its viciously sharp edge.*

*"Yes," she choked out."Yes."* 

*** 

"Will you join the Rapture, girl?"Penelope stared at her parents' bodies, laying motionless on the floor, her mother's mouth still halfway open in shock.The familiar rage bubbled up within her, that out-of-control feeling she got worse and worse at hiding every day.Like she would suddenly snap without warning.Her finger twitched, caressing the handle of the dagger tucked into the sleeve of her shirt.She could do it.She could definitely kill the woman responsible for her parents' deaths right here and finally avenge them after all these years.She bit down hard on her bottom lip until a trickle of blood dripped down her chin.Then she tilted her head up, staring her commander straight in the eyes, her own face completely expressionless."Yes," she said.Only the barest moment of silence betrayed Lilith's shock.Penelope couldn't help but feel a small inkling of savage joy.Nothing surprised Lilith.Nothing.She turned on her heel.She dropped a small round disc on the floor, which immediately projected a light blue, oval hologram into the air."Follow me," she instructed, before stepping through the shimmering surface.Penelope took a deep breath.This was her final chance.The last chance she had to choose instead to run, to run across the seas to Eskor, and never touch this vile society again.She let her eyelids flutter shut for just a moment before her eyes popped open, and she took the final steps forward.*** 

"Commander!""What?"Lilith asked.Penelope glanced toward the girl bounding toward them.Her lips thinned into a straight line, and she stood a little taller.Lorna.She always was Lilith's favorite.And for good cause."M didn't make it back from his mission.We've lost track of his signal."Lorna bowed her head."Really?"Lilith's gaze flicked around.Penelope glanced around as well.The barracks were just as she remembered--with high walls of steel and glass, each room's doorways consisting of large arches.They'd had glass walls all around their bunks.Trapped like lab rats for the world to see.The Messenger had said it was because the Corporation wanted to promote transparency.But really, it was to ensure cooperation.She saw a couple of familiar faces, but no one she could recall in particular.Her brows furrowed.Something was off, but she couldn't quite make it out.A prickling sensation at the nape of her neck caused her to stand up straighter as her gaze snapped toward her left.She met Lilith's eyes."She'll do," Lilith said, nodding toward her.Lorna's face changed."Wait, Commander, I don't think--" 

"She'll do," Lilith repeated, her voice harder this time.She turned and left, her steel toed boots clacking loudly against the metal floors.Lorna glared at her, and Penelope could hear her teeth grinding."Come with me," she grunted.She led Penelope through the twisting hallways until they reached a familiar room.Lorna grabbed her hand and pressed it against the glass door, which shimmered for just a brief moment before solidifying once more.Penelope fought the urge to jab backwards into her stomach and twist her wrist, her body stiff from fighting the urge to get Lorna's disgusting hands off of her.Then Lorna shoved Penelope through the doorway.It faded into gas around her shape, then solidified again."Report for duty tomorrow at four," Lorna said, flicking her long braid over her shoulder."In the Famine room."She sneered at Penelope one more time before stalking off.Penelope took in the tiny room furnished with a small, twin sized bed, a small bedside table, and nothing more.She touched the smooth metal of the bed frame.She'd lived in this room last time too.For what brief respite it gave from the trainings and the missions, she'd appreciated it, as small and bare as it was.She kicked off her shoes and laid onto the scratchy sheets, then closed her eyes.This was it.This was the beginning of the end.

*New?First part !*



*****

Calm down. Kieran made sure to keep his voice steady for the both of them as he followed her down the winding spiral steps to their floor despite the fact that he could hear his own heartbeat thud in his ears.Shes going to be fine. 

They bumped into Baduk on their way down, coming back from the tavern.Hey, he said, but Lisa didnt hear him, and he had to grab at Kierans arm to stop him from flying past as well.He noted the serious expression on his friends face.Did something happen? 

Ardissia, Kieran said simply.Come to room 302 as soon as you drop that off. He nodded toward the tankard of beer Baduk had somehow managed to sneak out of the tavern.When they reached the room, the issue was obvious.Ardissia was lying in bed, two or three wool blankets stacked on top of her.Her face was flushed a deep red, unusually so, and her forehead was dripping with sweat.When Kieran walked closer, he could see that she was trembling, even though she seemed to be unconscious.He sat down on the bed next to her, touching the back of his hand to her forehead.It was scalding hot, and he jerked his hand back.He opened up his inventory and scrolled through it, pulling out a dark purple orb.He popped it into Ardissias mouth, tilting her head back slightly.Whats that? Lisa asked.It removes status effects, Kieran explained.His gaze never left Ardissias face, carefully scanning for signs of the flush disappearing.The room became silent then, and the only sound that could be heard were the hoots of the owls sitting on the branches outside their room.Baduk came rushing into the room moments later and sat down on the small, floral couch next to Ardissias bed.He barely glanced at her before turning to Kieran.Have you given her an S.R.P.yet?  

Kieran nodded.Baduk kept an eye on the clock on the wall, and when nothing happened within the next two minutes, Baduk turned to Lisa, who was sitting on her bed, biting at her fingernail.Lisa. 

She tore her eyes away from Ardissias flushed face, meeting Baduks gaze with wide eyes.Yeah. His brows were furrowed, and the expression made her nervous.When did she start being like this? 

I dont know, it happened so quickly.We were just getting ready for bed, and then all of a sudden she complained about a headache.She was just about to head out to buy some potions before she just collapsed.All I had were health pots, and I gave her all of them, but it didnt do anything. Lisa was nearly in tears at this point.Dont panic.Just talk through the events of the day.Dont leave out a single thing. 

Lisa carefully told them everything they did from the moment the group had split up after breakfast, down to the last detail.Her face burned as she thought of what had happened on their way back to the inn.&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

They had stopped in front of a small shop that sold jewelry because a golden ring with with a leaf design had caught Ardissias eye.The old woman inside hadnt shooed them out like at the other places, instead offering them lavender tea and biscuits.Lisa suspectedafter watching the old woman fumble with the teapotthat it was because her eyesight wasnt too good.She felt a pang of pity for the old woman, despite knowing she was an NPC.The store was small and crampeda table had to be placed out front to fit all the wareswith no order of any kind.Hollowed out from a tree trunk, like most other buildings theyd seen thus far, the shelves on the walls sat in several curved rows, filled to the brim with knick knacks of all sorts and different types of jewelry and wood carvings.Everything looked handmade.Besides the shelves, there was simply a small table with the teapot and plate of biscuits, a rocking chair, and two small stools.But despite everything, it was the first welcoming place theyd found all day, so they decided to stay for a bit and chat, and maybe get some clues about who might have some motivation to poison the lake.Oh, I dont know, the old woman said, rocking in her chair.It made a small squeaking sound as the runners on the bottom pressed against the wooden floorboards.Everyone depends on that lake, and I dont know who would go around poisoning it.Its a terrible business, that. Deep laugh lines were creased into the wrinkles of her olive green skin, and as she sighed and closed her eyes, they seemed to fade just a little, telling of a time when she was young, and perhaps quite beautiful.It is, Ardissia murmured.Are you su Lisa started, but Ardissia placed a hand on her knee and shook her head.It would be useless to press the issue.Um, are there any fun things to do around Redwater?

The old woman clapped her hands together.Oh, for pretty young ones like you there are tons!The Bell Tavern is quite the hangout spot at night, my grandson always goes there, and I hear theres a special event tonight at the Crystal Ballroom.Some sort of talk. 

Crystal ballroom? 

Oh yes, its by the town square, just a little clearing right off of it.Cant miss it. Her gaze turned toward the front of the shop.Oh, hello, dearie, welcome back.We have guests! 

The dryads tall frame seemed to fill the whole room as he lumbered in, his muscles not lithe and sinewy like the other dryads they had seen, but the type of bulkiness youd expect from hard, manual labor.He had angular, defined features, and the thin tunic he wore stuck to his skin from the sweat still dripping down his body.He glanced over them quickly while setting down the large pack filled with wood and metals that would eventually be carved into jewelry.Then his gaze snapped back onto Ardissia, roving over her before his features settled into a lazy grin.There was an intensity to him that Lisa couldnt quite place that seemed out of place in the town.He sauntered over to her, nudging up her chin to meet his face with a bent finger.Hello, gorgeous.Whats your name?Mine is Kadus. 

Ardissia jerked her head back and tried to lean away from him on her small stool, her cheeks tinged pink, but there wasnt much room to begin with, and her back was already pressed up against the shelves.A strand of hair got caught in the wooden beak of a carved owl statue, and her face squished together as she felt a hard tug on her scalp.Here, let me get that for you. He tried to reach out to free her hair, but she backed even further, turning so she was facing him, leaning as far back on the stool as she could go.No, no!Um, its fine, dont worry, Ill-eep! She didnt get to finish her statement because in her quest to create some distance, she fell off the bar stool onto her back, her hair splaying out into a curtain on the floor under her.It seemed she had gotten the wind knocked out of her, because for a second, she simply laid there, staring upwards.Let me help you u- 

Im fine!Im fine! His words broke her out of her reverie, and she flailed her arms, trying to find something to grab onto.Her right hand finally found a shelf, but when tried to pull herself up using it, a small trinket laying on the shelf pierced her fingertips, and she was forced to let go.So she continued to lay there, feeling her face burn.Kadus simply stood there, his muscular arm still extended, looking at her with amusement.Lisa  stifled a giggle.She knew she probably should have helped, but it had been a long time since she had seen Ardissia so flustered, and it was more amusing than anything.Okay, um, thank you, Ardissia finally said, and took his hand.It was unusually warm, and she couldnt help but notice how easily he pulled her up.Perhaps he didnt expect how light she was as well because she flew towards him, her nose bumping into his chest.His arms came around her to catch her.He smelled of sandalwood.He immediately created some distance and reached out to rub the bridge of her nose gently with the pads of his fingers.You okay? 

Yep, totally! Her voice came out more high pitched than she had intended.She cleared her throat, her gaze darting over to Lisa.It was really nice meeting you, Kadus, and Im sure you and your grandmother are very busy, so well justshe shuffled towards Lisa and tugged her from the stoolget going now.Great meeting you!Bye! 

Could an NPC do that?Could they be soattractive and hit on the players?Was that even a thing?How could that be a thing?She had to admit, he was really something to look at.And his voice, so deep and smooth.God, if only he were real and this wasnt a video game

When she looked up again, they were at the town square.She looked down at her hand, suddenly realizing shed been grasping Lisas arm the entire time.Sorry. Her face flushed again.Lisa grinned.No worries.Although we did go in the wrong direction. She had fired off a message to Kieran in the meantime, telling them theyd be late for dinner, so they had a bit of time.She glanced around, her gaze falling on the relatively large gap in the trees to the north.That must be it.You wanna check out the Crystal Ballroom while were here? 

Um, yeah. She needed some time to calm down.She had never been hit on before, so it had been alarming.But also flattering.She shook her head, trying to clear the image of the dimple in his cheek from her mind.She forgot about the entire thing when they arrived in the small clearing that was the ballroom, her mouth hanging open in shock.Trees were interspersed in regular intervals throughout the clearing, but these were a pale grey, almost white, with thin, straight trunks that resembled pillars from the Colliseum.They stood taller than the trees in the surrounding area, their boughs hanging in arcs that overlapped and held each other up.The leaves glowed a luminescent blue.And hanging like fruits from the trees, were diamonds, hundreds and thousands of them, strung up onto the branches like Christmas lights.The sky was darkening now, but the leaves glowed so brightly that the entire clearing was lit up, the diamonds sparkling brilliantly in the light.They probably would have ended up standing there in the entrance of the clearance forever, except a Sylph bumped into Ardissia on its way in.It didnt seem like he recognized her because he barely gave her a glance before moving towards the front of the clearing, to where a stand had been set up.But she cocked her head to the side.Wasnt he one of the Sylphs from the first day at the tree?She recalled him because they had made brief eye-contact, just for a second.But his eyes had struck her as unusual.They were so pale they were almost white, and it had made her jump when she saw him.They moved to the side, by the tree-line.And just in time, too, because Sylphs and Dryads came pouring in afterwards, some flying, others walking.The floor had been tiled blue and white, and as Lisa and Ardissia watched, a sylph pressed on one of the tiles, and it popped up into the air, revealing the small pole underneath that held it up.Others did the same, and soon, everyone was settled in, and only soft murmurs could be heard.No one noticed them, standing right at the edge of the clearing, their faces hidden in the shadows.I wonder what this is about, Lisa whispered.There was an energy in the air that made Ardissia nervous.The crowd was waiting for something.And they soon found out what it was when the grey-eyed sylph raised a hand and the crowd fell silent.For those of you who are new here, my name is Kigyo. His voice was smooth as silk, and it echoed slightly.Im glad to see there are more of you who have joined the counter-coalition. His eyes scanned over the crowd, and a hint of a smile appeared on his face, even as his wingspale like his eyesfluttered gently.Coalition?Lisa and Ardissia glanced at each other.As some of you know, the elves have been expanding westward past Eldham.And humanity and the Myrgs along with them.They have formed a coalition.Within the next ten years, their territory will be at Redwaters edge. A explosion of murmurs and no!s rippled through the crowd.But the treaty strictly forbids them access to territory past Harkdale! A voice shouted from the crowd.They had passed Eldham on their way here.It was quite a bit west of Harksdale already.Lisa moved further back and pulled up her map.For the first time, she noticed a tab on the side, marked Territories. She clicked on it, and the map became colored.The region with Harksdale and up to Eldham, extending  east, was marked red, while Redwater and to the west was a pale blue.Other colors were dotted here and there, green for orcs, purple for kobolds, and pink for pixies, but the two predominant colors were definitely red and blue.They no longer respect the treaty, Kigyo stated.So we neednt either.Poisoning our lake was an act of war, he spat.And if they want war, they shall get it.Its fact that dryads and sylphs have always been the superior race.We can shape the waters and the lands however we like, bend nature to our will His voice grew louder as the crowd began hooting and clapping.Except cook things apparently.I havent seen any meat all day, Lisa muttered.and it should be us, ruling over Harkstone!Do you agree? he shouted, and the crowd burst into applause, some of the sylphs flying into the air and doing loops while the dryads laughed.The trees around them began to sway, their limbs creaking as the leaves rustled from the movement.There was no wind though.Lisa glanced back toward the forest, at the rows of trees moving.Could Ardissia do that too?The hedge incident from the castle quest was still fresh in her mind.It is your duty to recruit warriors for our cause.Find those you can trust and bring them in, and if they dont see things our way, its your job to make them.Harkstone is ours! 

Harkstone is ours!Harkstone is ours! the crowd chanted, and the boughs of the trees seemed to hold in the shouts, turning the clearing into an echo chamber.Lets get out of here. Lisa grabbed Ardissias hand and ducked out of the clearing through the trees.Judging from the unfriendly glares they had gotten earlier today, she didnt want to know how they were planning on flaying her alive if they found her.It turned out it wasnt just the suspicion that they had poisoned the lake.It was that they were human and elf too.It looked like Redwaters lore had a hidden underbelly that Baduk either hadnt known or hadnt told them about.&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

And thats everything. Lisa bit her lip and glanced at Kieran.When she had mentioned what happened with Kadus, she saw his fist clench, just slightly.Baduk was silent for a moment.Then he walked over to Ardissia and pulled down the covers.He took each hand, checking it.When he saw the wound on her handthe cut from the jewelry piecehe frowned.His gaze turned to the flower crown on the dresser.You said the symptoms came on suddenly?  

Lisa nodded numbly.He didnt thinkher gaze turned toward the flowers.While earlier, they had seemed radiant, now their bright color now screamed danger.Baduk took the rag that Kieran handed him and pulled up the item analyzer screen.Then, using the rag, he carefully plucked off one of the flowers and settled it into the box on the screen.Within moments, the verdict appeared.Lisa felt her legs give way.Name:			Devils Rose
    Status:			DEADLY
    Description:	Found in the depths of Redwater, these bright pink blooms 
                    are beautiful but deadly.Named for its tantalizing beauty that 
                    entices the user to pluck one, it is harmless until ingested or until 
                    it comes into contact with the bloodstream.Symptoms: 		Fever, Trembling, Unconsciousness
    Cure:			None

Itit cant be true, right?It cant be. If they had been more careful, if they just hadnt

Lisa Kieran pulled her into his embrace, and she was surrounded by his familiar scent.Its not your fault. 

But it is.You can save her, cant you?Just make her well again.Please. She got up on her knees on the bed, tugging at his sleeves, her eyes wild with desperation.I cant. He looked away, and there was a deep sadness to them.I cant undo something thats already been done.But look. He had to stay strong for them.He was the older brother, and he had to stay strong, even if he felt like a vice was squeezing on his heart and he couldnt breathe.Its not guaranteed, alright?This quest could just be a random quest, and shell be fine. 

Right. Lisa felt like she was grasping at straws.It could just be a normal quest.And then shell be fine. She looked over at Ardissia, who had stopped trembling.In fact, she had stopped moving altogether.After a playerdies, they remain dead for half an hour.After the time is up, theyll re-spawn somewhere near where they died. Kierans gaze was fixed on Ardissia as well.She would be okay.There was nothing wrong with this quest as far as he could tell.And even if there was...He closed his eyes.There was nothing they could do now except wait.*****

I am so so so sorry about the late upload, crazy stuff happened and then I decided just to finish up The Forsworn really quickly so I could concentrate entirely on DP.But also a huge thank you to u/milokicks for holding me accountable, otherwise I wouldn't have realized it had been so long since I've updated.Anyways, enjoy!I'll be returning to my 1-2 day upload schedule for this story, no worries!*****

Lisa tugged on Ardissias arm as she raced toward the castle gate.She peered around, scanning over the mass of players in the plaza, over the group of elves who were playing catch with a small leather ball around the fountain and the dwarf wildly waving his fist while haggling over prices with the merchant on a corner of the street.*Where are you?Im at the castle gates.* 

She fired off the message, then carefully pulled out the daggers she had received.Check out the stats!Here. Ardissia, who had been busy examining her new weapon with all the giddiness of a young child having received a new toy, led Lisa through the process of opening her interface and pulling up the item examination screen.Look, like this. She took her own weapon and tossed it at the empty square slot pulsing blue in the screen.Her whipan intricate thing with a woven leather handlehad a delicate looking steel dragon bejeweled with emerald eyes that served as the keeper, attached to the handle.The thong itself was constructed from tiny strips of interlocking metal, and pushing a small switch on the side of the handle would cause alternating strips to flare out into barbs.Where there should have been a cracker, there was instead a tiny sharp blade resembling the stinger on a wasp.Funnily enough, the weapons name was the Wasp.And underneath the name on the interface was a gold rimmed banner that labeled the weapon LEGENDARY.Curious, Lisa lifted up her daggers to the screen, half expecting them to fall to the ground.But they simply hung in thin air, within the framework of her interface.Seconds later, the information popped up.Name:			Dragons Claws 
    Status:			LEGENDARY 
    Description:	Forged from the claws of Navyrth, the last red dragon of the Upper Realm, 						 
                   these blades will slice through any hide and cause grievous burn damage.Attack:			150
    Speed: 		    4.50
    Defense:		10
    Crit:			30%
    Passive 1:		Returns to the user after striking any object.Passive 2:		Grants the user 20% life-steal.It seemed quite strong.Especially from the way Ardissia was leaning over her shoulder, ooh-ing and ahh-ing over the passives.Ah, wait. Lisa took the daggers down, sliding them into their sheaths, then pulled out the egg she had received.The shell resembled black sapphire and seemed to glitter in the red glow of the setting sun.Indeed, the electric blue cracks appeared to pulse.She careful set the egg within the square slot on the screen, then watched as it began to analyze its contents.After what seemed like a century, the word ANALYZING fading in and out on the screen finally disappeared.Lisa blinked and looked over at Ardissia, who had also pulled out her egg and tried to examine it.Instead of the small ding they had received for the dagger, the interface instead make a low whomp sound, like if a tuba player played the lowest note for just a split second.Instead of stats, simply two words: UNKNOWN SPECIES.Then below them in a smaller font: 

&nbsp;

*Within a mouth that has no tongue,* 

*Something there will always run,* 

*Where mermaids sang their songs of yore,* 

*Penned in glass, written down as lore.* 

*Youll find the path within a town*

*Where amber liquid is most oft downed.*

*Dear traveler, dont fuss about taking heed,*

*For the path you will take is quite safe indeed.*

&nbsp;

The exact same words were on Ardissias screen, penned in a script that Lisa imagined ancient scrolls might have been written in.Lisa! 

Lisa whipped around to see furious hazel eyes.Kieran strode toward his sister, grabbing her arms and checking her up and down to make sure she hadnt been harmed.What were you thinking, going on a quest without me? 

I 

You could have been killed! 

Well 

I thought we had agreed, you would 

Kieran! Lisa finally yelled.Her cheeks flamed as she dragged her brother away from Ardissias curious gaze.He was treating her like a child.We didnt have any choice, she hissed in a hushed tone.They grabbed us from the street.And youre not my keeper anymore, I can make my own decisions. She rolled her eyes.Besides, we cant really die in the game anyways.

Kierans heart dropped.He looked at his sister, at his sister who was now only five inches shorter than him instead of a whole foot and who was standing there, her hair braided nicely without his help.Then he snapped out of it.Youre my little sister, and its my duty to protect you.Alsohe frownedwhat do you mean they grabbed you out of the street? 

The guards just came out and grabbed random people.You can ask anyone. 

Kierans head reeled.That wasnt right.The guards didnt just do that.And the head guard he had spoken to had explicitly stated that no quests were being held in the castle.Was this a new game mechanic the developers were trying out?Lisa noticed the way Kierans shoulders tensed and his lips thinned.He only did that whenever he was really worried or angry.Whats wrong? she asked.She bit her lip.He seemedscared almost, his eyes .In her memory, she had only ever seen her brother scared once.He had always been strong for her and for their mother.So seeing the expression on his face caused a frisson of fear to run down her back.It almost scared her more than the chimera had.He glanced at her before looking away, his jaw tight.Dont worry, its nothing. 

She grabbed his arm, forcing him to face her.Its clearly something, otherwise you wouldnt be like this. 

Its nothing you need to worry about, he said again.Lisa felt frustration bubbling up with within her.She took a step forward, and her eyes narrowed.You never tell me anything.You always think you know whats best, and 

Hey, guys, a voice interjected.you never let me make decisions for myself.How am I supposed to help if I dont know whats going on?And also 

Guys! 

Im supposed to protect you!Im your brother!If you think for one moment Im letting you walk into danger, then Kieran shot back, his hazel eyes flashing.Lisa, Kieran, please! Ardissia finally wedged herself between the two of them, an hand on Lisas arm and the other pressed against Kierans chest, pushing them apart so there was a more little distance between them.Lisa glared at Kieran, and he did the same, moving away from Ardissias hand and crossing his hands over his chest.Whatever the problem is, we can talk it out, right? 

 Lisa fumed.Theres nothing to talk about.Come on, Ardissia.Were heading out and leaving this bonehead to stew in his own ego. She turned around, determined to be anywhere but here.She grabbed Ardissias arm.Youre not going anywhere. Kierans voice was low and dangerous.Were staying right here, where its safe. He grabbed Lisas shoulder and pulled her back.She shrugged it off.In your dreams. 

But then Ardissia gently tugged her arm out of Lisas grasp.Lisa whipped around.Are you coming with me or not? 

Ardissias gaze shifted nervously, and she bit her lip.I think we should talk it through.Im sure Kieran has a good reason for being cautious, and 

Youre just saying that because you have a crush on him, Lisa snapped.Ardissia jerked back as if she had been slapped, her green tinted cheeks now blotted a deep shade of red.Her gaze shot toward Kieran then back at Lisa, and her eyes shifted downward.Lisa, y-you know thats not true.I dont- I dont even know him that well, and  

Lisa immediately felt a wave of remorse rush through her.Im sorry.I shouldnt have said that.I was just really frustrated. She glared at Kieran again.Ardissia turned her large, green eyes toward her, her expression hurt.I just wanted you two to talk it through.The quest *was* really strange, with the messages not sending and the shifting landscape, which Ive never seen happen before.And the entire place had a weird feeling to it, like we were stuck in some sort of void.I just think we should hear Kieran out. 

Lisa turned her head.She didnt want to admit it, but Ardissia was right.The entire quest had given her a feeling of unease that she couldnt shake, like a fish bone lodged in the back of her throat.Fine, she finally made out through gritted teeth.She crossed her arms over her chest and waited.After his outburst, Kieran had regained his composure.The quest you were just on didnt exist.Im not sure what that means, but I was asking around, and no one seems to know what happened to the rest of the people who went in.They never came back out. 

Lisa blinked.But that wasimpossible.Almost fifty people went in, and they should have been long out by now, even if they had just died and re-spawned outside.I got some names, and,he hesitatedtheyre all offline.Which shouldnt be possible because of the beta contract.Somethings wrong, Kieran continued.Maybe some glitch with the games re-spawn, maybe with the VR pods themselves, but I cant guarantee your safety. His gaze was focused on Lisa when he spoke.I know you cant leave because of the contract, but we can just stay here until the month is up.It should be safe here, and as long as we dont die, nothing should go wrong.

This was supposed to be our trip together, Lisa finally said, having calmed down enough to rationally think about the situation.She hated that the words came out almost whiney, as if she had turned back into the ten year old girl begging her brother to buy her ice cream.We cant just sit here and do nothing for a whole month. 

Kieran shrugged.Its the safest option. 

Wait, this doesnt even 

But the problem is only with the weird quests, right? Ardissia looked toward Kieran.Ive never heard of the castle quest before even.But everyone seems to be okay doing the regular quests still, so if were careful and just stick to the common quests, everything should be okay, right? 

Yeah, thats a great compromise, actually.Well just stick to the really common quests.  

Kieran was silent for a moment before nodding, his eyes fixed on Ardissias face, scrutinizing her.Thats great then! Ardissia clapped her hands together and grabbed Lisa and Kierans hands, folding them together.Everyones happy this way. She laughed, a sound like the soft tinkle of a bell.Lisa noticed Kieran simply staring at her, his expression unfathomable.Her laughter was infectious though, and soon Lisa had a small smile on her face again.Okay, so well rest up for the night, and then we can go to Redwater tomorrow?I heard they have a great carnival and really fun games. Ardissia skipped down the road with the two siblings in tow, in the direction of a small inn she had seen on their way into the town.*****

The ride up was dead silent.The usual sounds of cables working or the beeps that told you when you passed each floor didn't exist.If someone had told Nathan he was in a vacuum and that he'd been launched up into space, he probably wouldn't have doubted it.Maybe they were just messing with him?Maybe they had just locked him away to preserve some evil mastermind image for Bolton, and he was the sacrificial lamb.He could see it in the newspapers now.MAN VANISHES INSIDE HELMAN HEADQUARTERS.BOLTON PROVIDES NO COMMENT.Before that, his boss would wonder where he'd went.He would lose his job through no fault of his own, and then his girlfriend would weep over his empty grave because his body wouldn't ever be recovered, but she'd know that he had died.His spine stiffened.No.No one would even know he was dead because none of the other journalists knew him.He wasn't supposed to be here even.He'd wanted to prove that he could cut it as a journalist who could investigate hard news, so when news had been revealed that Bolton was flying back to the US from a case in the Netherlands defending Phantasm--acquitted by the jury, no charges--he'd ditched trying to spy on the celebrity he'd been assigned and instead had come here.Straight to his death.Just as Nathan began to feel an overwhelming sense of dread for his uncertain future, the doors opened.The light was almost blinding.Nathan squinted, bringing a hand up to let his eyes adjust.Complete opposite from the tinted windows on the ground floor, the windows here seemed to let in too much light, barraging him from all sides.Then with a soft shuttering sound, the light vanished.Nathan blinked a couple of times."So what do you want to know?"The voice, low and smooth, came from somewhere in front of him."Um, yeah."He brought down his hand, then gasped.There was...nothing.In the large room that seemed like it extended impossibly upwards and outwards, there was not a single thing that would allude to Bolton's job as a lawyer.No desk, no papers, no furniture.Nothing.The man himself stood before him, dressed impeccably in a sharp grey suit, his back turned toward him, looming large as life at 6'5"."How do you do it?"Nathan finally blurted out."It's so clear that they're doing all these evil things, and I think no one understands--not even the jury themselves understand--how you manage to set all these supervillains free.""Is it that difficult to understand?"Bolton didn't turn around.Instead, Nathan could've sworn he heard him let out a soft sigh."You know what the world loves most, Nathan?"Nathan thought for a second, his pen poised over his notepad."Superheroes?"Bolton shook his head."Nothing so specific as that.The world loves complexity.Chaos.Change.It's why all we love heroes that turn bad."Nathan's brows furrowed."That's not tr--" 

"But it is.Uncorruptible heroes are bland.Boring.But there is a flip side to that."Bolton turned around, and for the first time, Nathan could see his impassive expression.As if were separated from the world altogether, no different from that android girl.It was...strangely uncanny."What is more attractive than a hero who turns bad is a villain who turns good.The world loves to see a happy ending."Bolton smiled blandly, and the expression sent a shiver up Nathan's spine."But they do not have to become innately good.No.That would be too hard.Instead, it is merely enough to provide the perception of goodness.Everything in the world is about perception.I'm simply giving the world what it doesn't realize it wants.A reason to go on."Bolton was quiet for a moment.Then he spoke again."You may go now."Nathan gulped."Why did you tell me all this?"Bolton turned his gaze toward him, and Nathan stood completely still.He felt his entire existence being examined from top to bottom.Bolton smiled again.But this time, Nathan could've sworn he caught the slightest bit of warmth to it."Because I don't think you'll tell anyone.And because at the end, I am tired of all of this, and I think you'll be back."Bolton's gaze briefly swept past him, as if he were thinking about something distant, before it centered on him again.It was in that moment that Nathan realized his eyes weren't the dark brown that the world had initially thought, but a deep, brilliant purple."You'll have plenty to learn before you're ready."

"Chip?"he proffered, sticking out the bag towards Kasen as he stuck another into his mouth.It made a--one--crunching sound, then disappeared down his fish-scale covered gullet."Um, no thanks," the boy said reflexively.He dropped his keys on the counter and slid off his shoes.Then, just as he was about to head into his bedroom, he paused.His head whipped back toward the creature with vaguely human-like features but was clearly Not Human."Wait, what are you doing here?"The creature shrugged."Your dad was worried about you.""Worried about me?"Kasen's brow furrowed."Did he seriously say that?"The creature shrugged, turning its bulbous eyes back towards the television that was still blaring.If Ellie and Charlie didn't stay together, he was going to lose it.Kasen stalked in front of the television and crossed his hands over his chest."Brabec..." he said, his tone dangerous.Brabec flailed his arms--sticky and slightly tentacle-like, but otherwise human--around in exasperation.He would have never taken this job if he hadn't been threatened with non-existence.He could be sitting in his own cave right now, watching Love Island on a 50-inch plasma screen TV, and instead, here he was, babysitting Satan's son.He sat up, leaving a gooey residue in a vague human shape on the couch cushion."Look.It's not my fault you didn't read the lease, okay?You think you can get this good of an apartment on your money?Your dad is paying half your rent.And all of mine," he added."So go off and do whatever it is you rebellious teenage boys want to do, and I'll sit here and finish my episode."He shooed Kasen off.Kasen's eyes narrowed, a dangerous aura emanating off of him.Brabec gave him a wary look but otherwise remained unmoved.This boy thought he was dangerous just because he could summon a ghoul.Well, he ate ghouls for breakfast.Which is also why he was chosen for the job.Then Kasen groaned in exasperation."Fine, I'll go talk to father myself."He vanished."Good!"Brabec shouted out after him."And bring back some ghoul chips!I forgot them because I got chased out so fast.What a ridiculous father-son pair," he muttered under his breath."They better leave me out of the next argument or I'm moving out of hell myself."

*New?First part !*



*****

Lisa moved aside the window curtain and peeped out at the door.Mom, its Finn! she yelled toward the kitchen, then clambered off the couch.Finn was Kierans best friend, and they often hid away in his room, discussing work-related things that Kieran said she didnt need to know about.Finn, like Kieran, had gotten into technology at a young age, and his knowledge of VR was on par with Kierans.He worked for Harkstone, and theyd met during company discussions to integrate VR pods into Harkstone.She opened the door and grinned at the lanky brown haired boy with blue eyes.Hi, Finn.Kierans not back from work yet.Do you wanna wait for him?

She waited for his usual lopsided smile that always made her heart beat just the tiniest bit faster, but it never came.Instead, she got barely a hint of a smile before Finns gaze shifted away.Hey, Lisa. His voice was gentle.Is your mother home?Id like to speak with her. 

Yeah, shes just in the kitchen.What did you want to talk about? 

Finn opened his mouth, then closed it.Then he took a deep breath.I just need to speak with your mom first. His voice came out a bit nasally.Something was wrong.Something was very, very wrong.She watched as Finn walked quickly towards the kitchen and said something to her mother, and then the both of them moved into her bedroom and closed the door.Lisa tiptoed to the door and pressed her ear against it, but she couldnt hear anything.After what seemed like forever, the door clicked open, and she sprang back.Finn, what happened?Tell me! 

But he didnt even look at her, his head bent low so that she couldnt see his expression, and walked out the front door.Lisa stared at the front door for a moment before turning back toward her mothers bedroom door.Now that it was open, she could hear the low, muted sobs coming from inside.Her feet felt heavy as she slowly walked into the room.Her mother was sitting on the side of the bed, bent over with her face pressed into the covers.But even that couldnt muffle the sharp inhalations of breath and the way her body shuddered.Mom! Lisa ran up to her, putting a hand on her back.Whats wrong? 

Her mother didnt seem to register her touch, but her sobs became louder.Lisa felt chills run down her back.Her mother never cried.Even when their father had left them for another woman, even when she found out that she had lost her job and the three of them might be cast onto the streets any day, she had never cried.Mom, please! Lisa felt tears begin to fall from her own eyes.Its not Kieran, is it?Did something happen? The questions slipped from her lips unbidden.Finally, her mother raised her head from the bed covers, turning her tear-streaked face towards her daughter.She looked stricken, her face pale and her hands trembling uncontrollably.Lisa had always thought that her mother looked young, but in this moment, she finally saw the wisps of grey hairs and the signs of wrinkles on her mothers face.Mom? she asked, unsure.Her mother simply pulled her into an embrace.She would never forget the warmth and dampness of her mothers tears drenching through her t-shirt as she stood there silently for an hour, waiting for her mother to stop crying.&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The room was completely silent as they waited.It seemed even the crickets outside had quieted, as if they knew what had happened.Lisa sat there, on her bed, staring at Ardissia, while Kieran stood with his back propped against the wall, his lips pressed into a thin line and his head down.His posture looked relaxed, butout of the corner of her eyeLisa noticed he would tense up every once in a while, as if he had to force himself to appear calm.Baduk simply sat on the couch with a blank stare.Just when Lisa despaired of anything happening, Ardissias body began to glow.Softly at first, then stronger, pulsing a golden color.Then, her skin began to shimmer, small flickers of light rising off her body and swirling around her before they were all that were left of her as she faded away in front of their eyes.Lisa didnt move.She felt pinned to the bed, unable to even open her throat to say anything.What if she just disappeared forever?What if the people who died in the quests didnt re spawn, as Kieran did, but were justgone?Her fingers felt ice cold.But as soon as the last flickers of light settled onto the bed and disappeared, Kieran pulled up the map.He exhaled a breath, zoomed in on the exact location, then met Lisas gaze.She had been staring at him, her face full of hesitationwanting to ask but not daring to.Shes on the market street, at a small shop that sells jewelry.I can teleport us there.But he didnt get to finish before Lisa darted out the door, her legs pumping as fast as they possibly could.Her vision felt blurred, and her lungs burned, but she didnt dare slow down.Ten minutes later, she reached the street they had been on just that afternoon, and she finally slowed down when she saw the outline of a figure sitting in front of the jewelry shop, illuminated by the soft glow of the full moon.She couldnt move.What ifwhat if it wasnt her?It had to be, right?Suddenly, she was struck by the vision of herself, standing on that crowded downtown street back at home, simply standing there in the middle of the sidewalk as people yelled at her for blocking the road before walking around her.Every time she saw a tall, lanky man with black hair walk past, she would grab at their arm.They would turn, and she would let go, unable to even let a sorry slip past her numb lips as they stared at her strangely before moving on.She didnt know how long she stood there, but the sun had almost set when a policeman had walked up to her, telling her that he had received several calls about a strange girl.Luckily, he recognized her because he had been good friends with her father, and he brought her home.Her mother had been out of her mind with worry.Lisas voice had been stolen from her, and she hadnt known how to get it back.She didnt speak for three months afterwards, and it was only when her mother broke down that she finally realized she was hurting her mother more.That she wasnt the only one in pain.The figure turned just slightly, and Lisa felt a lump rise in her throat.A button nose, and large, luminous eyes.She broke unto a dead sprint, finally falling into a heap besides Ardissia and raining her with kisses on her forehead and enveloping her in a tight hug.Ardissia groggily blinked at Lisa.Where am I? 

Kieran and Baduk had arrived as well, Baduk bent over and panting from trying to keep up with them.Check your menu.Is the logout button still enabled? Kieran asked, his voice tight.He wouldnt allow himself to happy until they were sure.Ardissia extracted an arm from Lisas embrace and pulled up the menu.After a split second, she nodded, and it was only then that Kierans shoulders sagged with relief, a smile creeping up his face.Lisa had been holding it together alright until now, but she finally broke down into big gulping sobs.Im so glad youre alive, she wailed into Ardissias shoulder, and at first Ardissia simply patted her back and murmured words of consolation with a small smile, but when the waterworks turned into snot that dripped dangerously close to her shoulder, she began squirming.She desperately glanced at Kieran.Receiving her cry for help, he walked over and dragged Lisa off of her, stuffing one tissue into Lisas hand and the other onto her nose, wiping all over.Youre getting it all over my face! Lisa yelled, flailing her arms.One hand smacked into his stomach, and he made an oof sound, forced to let go of her as he landed on the ground, bottom first.She whipped around, grabbed at the tissue, and laughed.Kieran glared at her.Dont you dare. 

She cackled, then lunged at him.He was on his feet in a split second, hurtling back towards the direction of the inn, Lisa close on his heels.Ardissia giggled, still sitting on the cobblestone as she watched their antics.She couldnt deny that shed wonderedfor just a momentif it would be the last time shed see her parents and Lisa and 

She closed her eyes.It wouldnt do to linger over it anymore.Baduk walked closer, his square face split into a huge grin as he bowed and flourished his hand, extending it toward her.Back to the inn, my lady? 

She grasped his hand and let him pull her up.Then they slowly walked back to the inn together, Ardissia taking in deep breaths of the crisp night air with her head tilted back to admire the bright moon and stars shed wondered if shed ever see again.*****

"It's very rare.You are one of few."Liana--or whatever her name was--said.She stared at him intently, her silver eyes unwavering as she sat completely still, in her hand a quill.Her hand hovered over the large, dusty looking tome in front of her, half obscured by a mountain of wax.Christopher shied away from her gaze and slouched down in his uncomfortable wooden chair.There was something oddly unsettling about it, in an uncanny valley sort of way.He couldn't *quite* say there was emotion in her voice.Just like he couldn't didn't *quite* think she was human.This wasn't right.He glanced around at the dimly lit room, with its dusty red couch that must have seen centuries of wear and tear and its grey--was it always grey?--carpet.A candelabra stood on the mahogany table separating him from her.A single candle, placed in the center, flickered slowly, but didn't go out.Every once in a while, a dribble of wax would run down the side and splatter onto the wooden surface of the table, slowly adding to the mountain of wax that was threatened to overtake the surface.The candle was three-quarters gone, by his approximation.He glanced at the glowing silver thread, nearly invisible except when he turned his hand toward the left, that linked his wrist to the edge of the table.He tugged at it, expecting to encounter resistance, but it merely stretched."Christopher.""Yes."He fiddled with the bottom button of his shirt, flipping it over.The button had clearly been sewn on again--it was a different color from the rest of them, and an ugly brown at that.The needlework was messy, but...he could feel the care that had been put into it."Can I not know what my life was like?"A voice in his head was screaming at him.Take the reincarnation.Start anew.What did the strange lady even mean by ads?But there was another voice.A softer voice that said, don't.Continue on as you did.Even if he couldn't remember a single aspect of his life.He worked the button in his hand, his head downcast."You don't have much time left.If the candle runs out, your decision is made for you."Christopher could hear it now too.Each spatter of wax, rhythmically ticking down the time.Would it be so bad to not have to pick?Either option seemed fine.Continue life with ads--he'd been living with those his whole life anyway--or to start fresh.No ads.A simple payment of time, so that he started again as a babe.But something in him told him that was the wrong choice.So he took a deep breath."Ads," he choked out.The woman picked up the fountain pen, and without hesitating, scribbled his name into it."Good luck," she said simply.Then with the nub of her quill, she sliced through the silver thread.Christopher's heart skipped a beat.He suddenly realized he should have asked what the ads actually were.Why didn't he do that?Then his vision went dark.&nbsp;

*** 

&nbsp;

"Christopher.Christopher!"The incessant shouting caused his brows to furrow.So loud.He tried to open his eyes, but they seemed glued shut.He tried again.Something grabbed his hand, warm and sure."Christopher, please.Please."A plain, white ceiling.Christopher stared at it, his eyes drooping back down slightly.He was so tired.He just wanted to sleep.And on top of that, his entire body ached something fierce.But the voice next to him wouldn't allow him to.He turned his head and stared the woman in the face.Large, brown eyes.Freckles on her nose.A small mole, almost imperceptible by her lip.The memories flooded back.The freak car accident.His wife."Mina," he choked out.She clasped his hands in hers, a loud sob escaping her.He took a deep breath.So it was all a dream.Thank god.He glanced over at her, a small flicker of a smile coming to his lips.Life was good.A small flicker of something bright near her wrist caught his attention.Christopher's brows furrowed.With some difficulty, he flipped her wrist over.A slight chill ran down his spine.He had no idea what it meant.What it could mean.But there it was.&nbsp;

A faint, almost invisible, glowing silver thread wrapped around her wrist.

It's not for us, see?"Zechariah pushed up his glasses, the glint in his eyes unmistakable.Sheer, unadulterated excitement.He buzzed around the rest of the archeologists like a fly, his enthusiasm propelling him from group to group as he joined in discussions ranging from the large pillar in the center of the room covered in glowing hieroglyphs to the helix on the floor that spiraled out across the vast cavern--all two miles of it.Iyana frowned.She hadn't wanted him on the team in the first place--he'd come highly recommended by Kamar, and Kamar was known for liking bootlickers more than actual researchers--and now she was stuck.She rubbed at her temples and squeezed her eyes shut."Zechariah, join the excavation team."She gestured toward the next room over, where a team had been ordered to look at a massive, glowing stone that spanned almost fifty feet high and ten feet wide.Shaped like an indistinguishable blob, it pulsed a gentle blue.There were strict orders not to touch it.It had already been okayed by the radiation team, but you never knew with this kind of job.In fact, none of them were touching anything in the room, save the floor.Iyana turned back to the discussion at hand."Try to confirm the material of the pillar," she murmured to Rishi, then snapped off her gloves.It was a pale white.Almost marble-like in its whiteness but just a little too porous to be polished stone.A panicked shriek reverberated through the cavern, rending through the empty space like a knife.Iyana froze for just a moment before bursting into a dead run toward the room where it had originated from--the stone room.Inside, a gaggle of archeologists were shouting profusely, clinging onto each other as they stared at the large rock in horror.It was almost impossible to describe the magnificence of the scale of such a thing unless you were standing in front of it.It had an almost eerie quality to it.A magnetic draw.Iyana blinked.Why had she come in here?Right.She turned toward the subteam leader, Mallory."What happened?"she snapped.Mallory's eyes were wide, wider than she'd ever seen them, with an expression Iyana knew all too well."He...he touched the stone but it wasn't solid anymore, it was like jello, and then he just got sucked in, and we couldn't stop it, and we have no idea where he is..." Her voice petered out as she became choked up."Who?"Iyana's head snapped toward the glowing stone.She stepped closer to try to examine it.But she already knew before Mallory replied.The only person who would disobey direct orders.Zechariah.She could faintly make out a shadow within the stone that wasn't there before--a humanlike form.How it happened, she had no desire to know.It was best to leave some things in the dark.They should wait for the extraction team.She knew that.That's what they were here for, but they were fifteen minutes away, and if Zechariah really was in there for fifteen minutes, he'd likely be dead."Give me the pickaxe," she said, extending her hand.After a moment of complete silence, the familiar wooden handle was laid in her hand.She walked up to the stone.Taking a deep breath, she swung the pickaxe over her head, laying it against the glowing stone.A small hiss, and a crack.She did it again.A larger crack this time.Over and over again, she struck the same crack, until finally, with a resounding thud, a portion of the stone fell off, a large enough size that a human could crawl through."Zechariah," she choked out.Finer than dust, the glowing particles bled through the mask.She adjusted her mask anyway."Zechariah!"There was no response from the dark gap in the rock.Her lips thinned and she turned around."Mallory, call the--"

A gasp from Mallory startled her.Mallory stared past her head, her eyes wide.Iyana whipped around.It was Zechariah.The blood drained from her face as she stared at the vaguely humanlike creature in front of her.Puffed and bloated blue, with sores pulsing over its body, it was only recognizable by the glasses still sitting on its face.Only...there wasn't much of a face left.A puckered hole in the center was all that was left, atop which the glasses rested.The creature made a pitiful mewling sound as it wobbled, just barely maintaining itself upright.Iyana took a step back.Whatever that was, it wasn't Zechariah any longer.And it most definitely wasn't human.

"--him?"she finished.Luna blinked.The darkness of the room had given way to a bright midday sun that beat down on her shoulders and sapped her strength immediately.The paved dirt road beneath her feet and the carts lining the edges of the street told her she was in some sort of marketplace.A man shouted at her from the side of the road."Move!"Startled, she glanced around.Oh.She was blocking the path.She shuffled to the side of the road, taking it all in.Starting from two years ago, Killian had begun training her on all of history.She couldn't count the number of times she'd fallen asleep only to have a history book fall onto her face and wake her up.From the Byzantine Empire to the Qin Dynasty, she'd memorized so many different cultural facts and fashion styles that she'd wanted to give up.In fact, she nearly had, a year ago.When her mother had died in the car accident.And it was Killian who had dragged her out of bed every day with threats for six months.She owed her life to him.And now, she understood what it was all for.The men and women all wore simple wraps with sleeved, collarless qamis with mantles.She didn't even have to think.She was in Arabia.The thought sent a little thrill through her.But her good mood was immediately dampened by the realization that she had no idea how to find Damion.She couldn't very well walk through the streets, shouting his name and hoping he'd turn up, could she?"Move out of the way!"The sharp order was followed by a horse's neigh as the crowd on the streets began to part.Luna craned her head to check out the commotion.A man rode through the streets, a sword at his side.Other men who also appeared to be soldiers walked behind him, one of them raising a black flag with white calligraphy on it.That was one of Muhammad's flags.And dragged by another horse was a giant, wooden cage on wheels.Luna's eyes narrowed.There were...clothes inside?It looked like a pile of cloth.But why would they need to put that in a cage?Then, as the cage rattled past her, the bundle of clothing moved.Luna nearly jumped.It wiggled around for a bit before a face appeared in its midst.A dirty, gaunt face, but a recognizable one nonetheless."Damion!"Luna yelled, pressing forward against the people in front of her, waving her hands desperately at him.The person's eyes opened.Damion looked at her, a slight look of confusion on his face, before he yawned and turned his back toward her.Luna's hands dropped her side.There was no recognition on his face.Not even the slightest.She stared at the cage, rumbling down the street, with a growing sense of dread.If she wasn't wrong, he was about to be hanged.She broke into a run, following the cage as best she could."Damion!"she yelled again and again, hoping to catch his attention and to see some indication that he was the person she was searching for.But he never responded again.The cage finally stopped moving when they reached a giant square.In the center was a giant platform, on it a masked man.Luna groaned.Stupid.Hangings weren't until later.This was a public execution by beheading.She stomped her feet, struggling against the excited crowd as she fought her way closer.Damion was manhandled out of the cage, the soldier who had been riding on the horse shoving him toward the platform.He staggered, but managed to stay on his feet, dragging them slowly toward the wooden stage that would be his death.The crowd grew louder around her.*Think, Luna, think!* 

The masked man kicked Damion's legs, forcing him to his knees.He picked up the sword.It gleamed in his hands.Luna stamped her feet.She was out of time."Stop!"she yelled, pushing forward in sheer desperation."This man is not to be harmed!"As if by a miracle, the crowd became silent, curious faces peering at her as they let her walk toward the platform.The soldier's eyes narrowed."Who are you to interfere with this man's beheading?"Luna's mind blanked."I'm...I'm..."The man sneered, taking a step towards her.One hand went to his sword, as if to unsheath it."I'm a prophet!"Luna said.She cleared her throat and stood tall, willing them to not see her shaky legs."I'm a prophet of God.He has decreed that this man shall not be killed.""Oh?"the man said, crossing his arms over his chest.He looked at her with an amused expression on his face."And what proof do you have?God doesn't just talk to anyone."What did she have?What did she have?Luna's mind raced, her arms drawing toward her chest as she began to panic.She hadn't thought this through at all, and now she was probably next on the chopping block.Her arm brushed against something hard.She exhaled a tiny breath.Then her eyes flashed."I have a message from God himself," she said, reaching into her sleeve."A star from the heavens."She pulled out the time capsule, letting its deep blue glow brilliantly in the midday sun.The crowd gasped, and even the soldier backed up a step or two."If you kill this man," Luna continued, "blood will have blood."The man looked at her, his gaze calculating.Then he lowered his head."As you wish, prophet."He nodded toward the masked man, who slit through the rope binding Damion's arms.The man shoved Damion toward the steps leading off the platform.Luna fought the urge to help Damion up as he nearly stumbled.As he passed by her, Damion turned his head to look at her for just a second, his blue eyes lighting up with an emotion she couldn't quite place.Then he disappeared into the crowd.She'd done it.Luna fought back a smile and turned around to walk down the steps when a sheathed sword appeared in front of her.She looked up, meeting the soldier's hard gaze."If you are truly a prophet as you say, I must take you to meet him.Please, come with me."he gestured toward the opposite side of the platform, toward the other soldiers."Who am I meeting?"Luna's heart began to speed up.Wasn't it supposed to be over?He didn't answer her question."Come," he said again, leading her toward his horse."You must."He held a hand out.Luna reluctantly took it, pressing down and using the force to vault her right leg over the saddle.She sat tall.Her gaze landed on the black flag in the other soldier's hands.If her guess wasn't wrong, he was taking her to see Muhammad.The man who would eventually unify all of Arabia.***

Uvossa wiped at the corner of her mouth, where a dribble of blood had dripped down to her chin.It smeared, leaving a dark blueish-green mark across her skin.Then she bent down, picked up her sword from the ground, and swung it across her back.A muted ping sounded out, and she quickly flicked over her messages before turning her kohl-rimmed gaze toward Ardissia.Theres something that requires our attention, but well catch you later. 

Moments later, they were gone, and the bar was quiet once again, except for the muted clink of cutlery as the tavernkeep stood behind the bar, cautiously keeping an eye out for the still swinging doors as he cleaned the used silverware and plates.It almost seemed as if the fight had never happened, but for the shattered plates on the floor next to their table.Lisa glanced around the room, her gaze landing on the broom and dust bin in the corner.She walked over and grabbed it, and the tavernkeep shot her a grateful look, his surly expression lightening just a little.It was inevitable that bar fights broke out every once in a while; tensions ran high occasionally and drunkenness didnt help.But it wasnt often that the patrons stayed to help clean up.The rest of them had already begun dumping together the broken shards of ceramic from the floor, and Lisa swept them all into the dust bin.Then she wiped her hands on her tunicstill surprisingly clean considering blood had sprayed onto the table, although most of the damage had been contained to the floorand looked at the rest of them.Light Festival tonight, anyone? She sighed.It had been a really long day, and it wasnt even noon.&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Oh wow! Ardissia exclaimed, her eyes wide as she craned her head to see over the throng of people milling about.The huge congregation in the town square consisted of mainly sylphs and dryads, but a good number of players had gathered for the festival, and they roamed around in groups towards the different corners of the square, where various foods and games had been set out.Hundreds of lightning bugs lit up the night sky, even as the lamp posts on the edges of the square glowed warmly, flickering dimly every once in a while to give the appearance of light from a campfire.And on the outer edge of the square, to the east, a huge ferris wheel lit up the night sky, each chair the spitting image of Cinderellas carriage with little sparks of blue glittery light drifting down.Within seconds, Lisa and Ardissia had disappeared into the crowd, beelining towards the food.The corner of Kierans lips quirked up at the scene.Then he looked over at Baduk, who was already salivating over the food at the table closest to them.It wasnt a surprisethe Light Festival was the one day of the year where meat was offered.So they scrambled to get in line, their gazes fixed on the gigantic roast hog that looked like it must have weighed over 200 pounds.The line moved quickly, and within a couple minutes, Kieran was too busy shoveling meat into his face to notice the small spurts of laughter that came from somewhere in front of him.God, youre so embarrassing.

Kieran looked up to see his sister rolling her eyes.Ardissia stuck a toothpick into some black gourda vegetable with a stringy texture that strangely tasted like chickenand popped it into her mouth, a hint of a smile on her face.Kieran awkwardly wiped at his mouth with a napkin and slowed down, chewing and savoring the flavor.You guys got food already? he asked, trying to divert the topic of conversation away.Lisa raised an eyebrow and raised her plate slightly.cool. Kieran blinked, feeling his cheeks flush as his glance settled on Ardissia for a mere moment before flashing away.He was saved by the small silence that fell upon the crowd when a group of tall figures appeared among their midst.Uvossa.She towered a full foot above most everyone, and she quickly spotted them when Ardissia waved, gliding towards them, her tail sweeping out in an arc behind her.The crowd parted in front of her, and although there was the occasional sneer, no one dared stop them.And, it seemed, even the appearance of their supposed enemies couldnt tamper their excitement because moments later, the din was just as loud as earlier, and the sylphs and dryads simply pretended Uvossas party didnt exist.Thank you for everything. Her tongue flicked out of her mouth lazily.But it appearsss that theresss nothing we can do.Pleassse, enjoy yourssselves. She gave a small nod of thanks and backed away.Lisa followed the dragomirs figure as she headed toward the other side of the square.Uvossa was honestly just sobadass.If she could even be half as badass as her, it would be enough.Ladies, gentlemen, and faerie-folk, welcome to the Light Festival! A melodious voice rang out from the giant tree, and everyone turned to watch as Mehluni descended from the skies, her wings glowing so brightly Lisa had to blink several times to adjust her vision.Everyone gasped and exclaimed in awe upon seeing her.Mehluni had dressed up in a sheer, layered aqua gown that reminded Lisa of ocean waves.And upon her head, a tiarastudded with tiny diamonds and sapphires and emeraldselegantly woven into silver leaves, the lamplight reflecting off of the crystals to create almost a disco ball effect on the floor.Ardissia had clapped a hand onto Lisas arm in excitement.Even Kieran, who was notorious for not caring about fashion and who always used to go out in ratty t-shirts and jeans every day, stood there, slack-jawed.The silence was then followed by hoots and cheers loud enough to blast off ones eardrums, and Lisa visibly winced at the noise.Several sylphs flew up into the air andwhooping and holleringdid somersaults before landing back down.Mehluni simply laughed and raised her hand.The crowd fell silent again, except for an occasional hoot.I want to thank you all dearly for being here.The dryads, who have been our kin for centuries, and the travelers, without whom we would not learn new technologies.As you all know, this is a special festival for sylphs, in honor of Xeena, the Goddess of Light. 

May she bless us, the sylphs murmured.And may she bless all of you, as well, for without her, this world would not exist.I hope you enjoy yourselves, and may Xeenas light always shine down upon you! She clapped her hands together.Now, whos ready for the flower dance? 

A huge cheer erupted from the crowd, and immediately over a hundred sylphs shot into the air, circling each other and creating patterns in the sky with their luminescent wings to the backdrop of  a haunting song.And, impossibly, the fireflies joined them, creating swirls of light and filling in the patterns.They could do nothing but stare, mesmerized by the sight as the sylphs whipped around in the night sky.Lisa finally tugged on Ardissias sleeve.Isnt that Kadus? She pointed to a sylph on the edge whose wings were quite obviously larger than the others.Wait, but hows that -possible?Kadus was a dryad, and he definitely hadnt had wings before.They would have noticed.Sylphs can gift wings to dryads, you know.Its because of their bond with nature, a voice offered up behind them.Lisa and Ardissia turned to see Baduk grinning at them.Oh, thats pretty cool.But stop eavesdropping, mister. Lisa wrinkled her nose and stuck her tongue out at him.Hey, its my job. 

Guys, youll miss the show, Kieran piped up from behind them, and they both shut their mouths and turned back to the light show.After another round of oohs and ahhs from the crowd, there was suddenly a moment of stillness from the sylphs as they floated in place, their wings seemingly pulsing.And finally, Mehluni shot up into the sky, like Polarisa beacon of light against the darknessbefore disappearing.Then the rest followed, leaving silence in their wake.Baduk was the first to snap out of it.That was pretty good, he commented drolly.Lisa laughed.I guess thats one way to put it. She let out a deep breath, then glanced up at the sky again.She could still see phantom lights dancing against the sky.Come on, lets go ride the ferris wheel! 

&nbsp;

Wow, you can see everything from here!Look, look, theres the jewelry shop! Ardissia pointed toward the east at the unique tree.Each treetop was decorated differently, and that made it relatively easy to pick out landmarks.Youre right!Kieran, look! 

No thanks, he made out through pale lips.He sat completely still in the center of the carriage, looking straight ahead.Ardissia blinked at him.Whats wrong? 

Oh, Lisa clapped a hand to her forehead.Now she remembered why he had been dragging his feet when they got on.Hes deathly afraid of heights. Her eyes brightened, and she leaned in toward Ardissia conspiratorially.Wanna hear a story? 

Of course! 

When we were younger, I didnt realize this was why at the time, but we went to go ride a roller coaster, and he was so scared he ended up peeing his pants.He was sixteen! Lisa could barely tell the story through her gasps of laughter.I cant believe I forgot! 

You were still wetting the bed until you were nine, Kieran shot back, even though his face was deathly pale, his hands clenched tightly around the pole in the middle of the carriage.Hey! Lisa shouted, shooting upwards and stalking toward him.Ardissia was sitting between the two, and she put out an arm to stop Lisa while she extended the other one to pat Kierans back.She shot a look toward Baduk, but the halfling simply shrugged and continued to look out the glass at the view below.This was a once in a lifetime chance, and he would be damned if he was going to let another squabble between the duo ruin this experience.He narrowed his eyes and leaned toward the glass.Wait, Lisa, Ardissia, come look. He pointed toward the distance, what looked to be right up near the far side of the lake.Do you see that? 

Ardissia peered at the flickering light that was far removed from any other source of light in the entire town.Wait, isnt that near she turned toward Lisa, who was looking at the same spot with a frown of concentration on her face.Then they gasped at the same time and turned toward Baduk.We have to get off this ferris wheel *now*, they said in unison, then gave each other glances.If they were right about this, the mystery just might be solved tonight.*****

*New?First part !*



*****

The Devils Rose crown was still on the bedside table when they returned to the inn, and Baduk carefully tossed it into the trash can with a rag.The petals had gotten slightly crushed, and they left a red stain on the rag, which he threw away as well.When they had all reconvened in the roomArdissia spoke up.So whats our next plan of attack? The ordeal didnt seem to have taken too much out of her because her eyes were still bright, though her voice was slightly hoarse.I think the top priority right now is for you to rest, Kieran said.When Ardissia opened her mouth, he added quickly, at least for tonight.We can discuss things tomorrow. She had a stubborn streak just like Lisas, and he wasnt interested in having her run around on her own because they insisted on excluding her.Besides, there were no side effects to a normal death.Lisa nodded in agreement.Yeah.We can continue asking around tomorrow. Then her eyes lit up.We can go ask Uvossa whether theyve made any progress. 

Right, Baduk chimed in.Lets all get some sleep now!Hup hup!Back to our rooms! He clapped his hands together, then pinched Kierans arm.Kierans gaze had been fixed on Ardissia, and he startled at the sudden pain, snapping out of his reverie.They shuffled out of the room.&nbsp;

The next morning, Ardissia rose with the sun.The rest of the group tended to wake up later, but she had always enjoyed the feeling of being the only one up for a while.After firing off a message to Uvossa, she walked toward the window and glanced out.The scenery reminded her of the pictures shed seen of Switzerland: green, rolling plains mixed with forested areas, with snowy white peaks serving as the backdrop.The trees were tall though, much taller than any other tree shed seen before, with massive trunks that housed dryads and sylphs and all sorts of travelers.The only thing marring the scenery was the lake.Even from here, she could see the red tendrils crawling across the lakes surface like bacteria spreading its way along a petri dish, and the deep brown muck, turning the hints of blue-green into a murky light brown.As she watched, several sylphs flew into the air above the treetops before speeding in the direction of the mountains, with what appeared to be empty canvas bags in hand.A little while later, they returned, lugging the canvas bagsnow bloated and dripping droplets of waterbelow them.They disappeared into separate homes.What are you looking at? 

Ardissia turned and smiled at her groggy friend whose long, brown hair stuck up at various angles.Morning, sleepyhead. 

Lisa rubbed her eyes and yawned, then stretched her arms over her head before rolling over in bed and looking over at Ardissia with her eyes still half closed.Did you see anything interesting? The end of the question petered out into silence as she slowly drifted off again.Just then, there was a knock at the door, and Lisas eyes shot wide open.She jumped off the bed and opened the door to find Baduk and Kieran standing outside, fully dressed.Its so early, she said, glancing at the clock on the wall.Then she closed the door in their faces and climbed back into bed, bringing the covers over her head.Seconds later, the door opened again, and two walked in.Kieran grabbed the covers and whipped them off the bed, ignoring the way Lisa groped for the non-existent covers before sitting up and glaring at him.I remember you used to wake me up with breakfast and a song.What happened to that? 

Well, youre not a little girl anymore, Kieran shot back, even as his gaze unwittingly shot towards Ardissia and his cheeks tinged red.He was going to duct tape Lisas mouth shut when he got the chance.Lisa lunged forward to try and grab the blanket, but he held it high above his head.You need to get up. 

Lisa glared at him but got up.To be honest, she was glad that Kieran was treating her more like the way her friends big brothers treated them.Before, she had always felt like a porcelain dolllike she would crack at any moment.And although it felt nice to be cherished, at moments it could be stifling as well.But it was the slightest bit unnerving as well.It seemed like Kieran was undergoing some personality shifts.But was that even possible, given that he wasnt actuallyalive?She shook her head.It wouldnt do to worry about such things now, although she made a mental note to ask Finn about it later when she got out.Finn.The thought sent a little thrill of excitement down her spine.She had completely forgotten!He would probably be exhilarated to see his best friend again, even if just to say goodbye, and her mother too, and

A loud ding of a message arriving broke into her thoughts.She watched as Ardissia pulled up her messages.Uvossa suggested we meet at the tavern, is that okay? 

&nbsp;

The tavern was quite dark, with only a couple of luminescent vines hanging around to light up the place, and with tables splayed out across the floor in no particular pattern.It also served food and drinks besides alcohol, so a kitchen was hidden away behind the bar, and a young sylph would duck through the curtain leading to the kitchen every once in a while, bearing platters of fruit and other foods.There wasnt too remarkable, to be honest.But then again, it seemed more like a spot where the locals hung out, as the room was pretty full with dryads and sylphs when they walked in.No one paid them too much attention, and so they found an empty table towards the very back, and sat down to wait.It wasnt long before the noise in the tavern hushed.Lisa glanced toward the door to see the tall dragon-like figures filling in the entrance as they scanned the place.She had to admit, their stature was quite frightening, even after Kieran had explained that their appearance was actually the result of a trade with him and they used to be human-sized.Kieran raised a hand to wave them over.The sylphs and dryads in the tavern glared at the dragomirs, their gazes following them as they walked, while some of the other players stared at them curiously.Their table wasnt even close to large enough to fit the large frame of the dragomirs, so they had to pull two together, and Lisa could feel the stares as the table and chairs made a scraping sound as they were dragged over the wooden floors.The room remained eerily silent, and it was only when Uvossas crew had settled down that the normal buzz of conversation began anew, though more muted than before.Lisa was seated next to the largest of them.He turned toward her, smiledbaring his sharp fangsand introduced himself.And although she logically knew she had nothing to fear, there was still something unnerving about his predatory appearance.Ardissia, on the other hand, seemed to have built a rapport with them as two of the other dragomirs gushed over her cute appearance and discussing whether they should change their character models to dryads.Uvossa raised a scaly claw and gestured towards the tavernkeep.A glassss of ajova juice for each of usss. Then she smiled at Kieran, her gold, kohl-rimmed eyes mesmerizing in their appearance.The tavernkeepan older dryad who looked like he had weathered quite a few stormsnodded but said nothing.A couple moments later, their drinks arrived, and Uvossa was the first to raise her glass.Thank you for helping usss, and for standing up for usss. She directed the latter part of the statement directly to Ardissia, her eyes smoldering as she raised the glass to her, clinked it with everyone, then downed it.Lisa brought the fizzy light green drink to her lips as well.It slid down easily, a light airy flavor that reminded her of a cross between aloe and pear.It turned out the dragomirs hadnt made any progress as well.No surprise, because after seeing all the dirty glances the group had gotten from being in the tavern tonightmore directed at the dragomirs than themit seemed like they definitely received the brunt of the hatred.They were busy discussing a plan of attack for the next daythe current idea was to split up the shops and see if anyone had bought anything that could be used as a poisonwhen a dark shadow fell over Uvossa, who had her back turned toward the rest of the tavern.Lisa, however, had a clear view of the sylphs who had gathered behind them.And at the head, a grey-eyed sylph, tall and lean, with bright blue wings.Kigyo.Well, well, look what the cats dragged in. Kigyos eyes had narrowed into slits, and he stared down at them with a sneer.His teeth tapered off into fine points, and when combined with his ashy blue skin, they gave him an almost vampiric appearance.Lisa shared a glance with Ardissia.The dude was clearly asking for trouble.Ardissia made a face at Kieran, who was sitting next to Uvossa.He turned to put a hand on her shoulder to calm her down, but it turned out Uvossa had chosen her dragomir body for a reason: she had the temper to match.Uvossa shot out of her chair, the bar stool skidding backwards along the floor and crashing into another sylphs legs, whipping her long, scaly tail around furiously.Her eyes had darkened into a molten gold, and she pulled out her sword and brought it to his neck in one fluid motion.Faster than the eye could see, Kigyo had brought out a dagger as well, and the blades made a clinking sound as he brought the dagger up to block her sword.What do you want, sylph? Uvossa spat.I want your head on a stick.Are you willing to do that for me? Kigyo took a step back, casually scraping the blade of his curved dagger down Uvossas sword before twisting suddenly.Uvossa let out a hiss of pain, and the sword dropped to the ground with a loud clang.Uvossa wasnt one to be bested though, and she whipped out a dagger as well, taking a step back so she was out of his reach.By this point, everyone in the tavern was deadly silent and waiting to see what would happen.Kigyos group had their hands on their weapons, as did Uvossas party, while Kieran and Baduk remained wary but calm.Lisas gaze darted around.The tavernkeep had disappeared, as had all the workerseven the sylph behind the barso it looked like no help was forthcoming.Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the slightest flick of Uvossas tail.All hell broke loose.The male dragomir she had been sitting next to sprang to his feet, his mace a flurry of sharp spines meeting flesh as he swung it at the sylphs.Sharp cries rang out, and immediately two sylphs were taken out of commission as they clung to their shredded arms in agony.Ardissiaagainst Kierans protestsjoined the fray, using her whip to wrap around one dryads torso and tossing him at another, knocking both unconscious.Uvossa and Kigyo were locked in a sparring match, circling and dancing around one another.Kigyos movements were smooth and fluid, like a snakes, while Uvossa met his quick moves with strategic blocks, without a single superfluous motion.But unfortunately for Kigyo, their fight wasnt a one-on-one for long because the rest of his group fell easily.No surprise,  Several moments later, he found a knife against his throat from one of the dragomirs.His nostrils flared as his gaze darted around the tavern.Some of his members laid on the floor groaning, while others lay completely still and unconscious.Ready to leave usss alone? Uvossa snarled, baring her fangs.Kigyos jaw worked for a moment.Were going, he bit out.After feeding the group health potions, he flew out, and the group left as quickly as they had arrived.The remaining spectators filed out as well, their eyes wide with fear.Lisa watched as one of the dryads cringed when a dragomir casually glanced in his direction.She pulled one of the bar stools that had been kicked under the table in the hubbub upright and sat down, then sighed.Kigyo didnt seem like the type to give up easily.But on the bright side, at least they were probably safe from being harassed now once the word spread.*****

The first time it had happened, she had been ten.Armed with nothing but frustration and loneliness, she had willed Melinda into being.Melinda wasn't a pleasant girl--no--more reminiscent of the bullies that Lara had faced than the friend she had wanted, but she was company nonetheless.Sometimes Melinda would say things like, "your face is too chubby" or "get lost," but it didn't matter.They were tethered together.Until Melinda disappeared on the fifteenth of October on her thirteenth birthday, when Lara willed her away after a particularly nasty fight.Her mother was never around, having to work three jobs to support them after her father left, so her mother never knew.And it was years later that Lara would be thankful for it.The second time it had happened was when she was fourteen.Everyone knew that Bobby was a bad boy, but no one knew just how bad he was, relegating her life to hell on earth.She could never find her homework.Ever.Except when it would appear in front of the teacher's eyes with a different boy's name.There wasn't a scrape on her body that year that didn't bear his name.And when it had finally become too much, when she had finally broken down in the bathroom stall of her school, chunks of her hair just falling out as if they hadn't been attached to her head in the first place, Bobby simply...disappeared.Not gone in the way of missing posters, per se, but rather missing altogether, as if rather than a Bobby shaped hole in the universe where he used to be, the void had been filled by nothingness.No one knew he had ever existed.It was then that Lara realized Melinda might not have been an imaginary friend like her therapist had said after all.It was the first time she believed that there was something wrong with her in a way that wasn't wrong with anyone else.Because normal people didn't have Melindas, and normal people didn't know Bobby.And all she wanted was to be normal.The third time and the fourth time were more of a blur.Both times happened after breakups, and she wasn't entirely sure if it was the breakup that created the alternate universes or the loneliness that came after.All she knew was: sometimes she would wake up in a straw bed, the ocean front as her view, and other times she would wake up in a dimly lit cell, garbed in all white and pleading to be let out.The days blended together.At some point, she was one again, thanks to an accidental fire in the mental ward, which killed one of her, leaving only the other.She supposed she should be glad it was the one where she had no hope for a future.And maybe it would have continued this way forever.Until she found him.Around him, there was no pain, no loneliness.This was the fairy tale ending she had dreamed of her entire life.He brought her flowers, listened to her when she was sad, stood up for her when she couldn't stand up for herself.Her knight in shining armor.But no one told her the armor was to defend against her.One day, when the white picket fence was just within view, she overheard a conversation she should have never heard.And realized that he wasn't there because he wanted to, no, but as a duty.To humanity.To ensure she was happy, and to ensure what his superiors feared would never come to pass.Keep her happy, they said.Make sure no one else disappears.That day, Lara was the calmest she'd ever been.There was no outburst of emotion like there'd been before.No pain, no tears.Just realization.Her mother had always told her she was strong-willed.That she could do anything she put her mind to.So on the fifteenth of October, Lara did what should have been impossible.She willed herself out of existence.

Lisa watched as the Dragomir next to her pulled out a sword the size of her entire body.Its hilt was covered with opals and emeralds, and she couldnt help but glance up toward its owner, who was over seven feet tall, his scales a dark blue, almost black.Her gaze mustve drawn his attention because he glanced at her as well.What do you want? His voice was gruff, like he had been smoking for fifty years.He shifted, and his clearly defined biceps rippled under his scaly skin.Nothing, she said quickly.Blindly grabbing at Ardissias arm, she shuffled the both of them closer to Kieran.The timer was ticking closer to zero now, and the clamor of players all moving towards the large tree at the center of the town square and the pings as they messaged members in their party began to calm down.The tree had long, thin branches, and its trunk was almost a grayish color with a smooth bark, as if it had been polished.A good number of branches extended horizontally, and they reminded Lisa of benches.Instead of leaves, small, white flowers grew all along the branches, and they seemed to glow in the sunlight.An elf guffawed loudly, but was quickly shushed by members of her party as the atmosphere began to grow tense.Finally, an eerie silence fell over the crowd as the banner in the sky hit zero, then exploded into brilliant flashes of light, like fireworks, that drifted down from the sky like glitter before the particles grew larger and larger, turning into a shower of coins.Loud shouts and gasps of joy was accompanied by the rhythmic clinking sound of gold dropping into players inventories.The sound of flapping wings filled the air as the sky above their heads darkened momentarily, the sudden breeze almost making Lisa lose her footing.Ardissia actually didshe had been too busy looking at the flowersand she jumped at the wingbeats, nearly tripping over Baduk.At the top of the tree, in the very center, a large branch that should have stood straight up had instead been cut short, and it acted as a platform upon which a faerie-like creature landed.The rest of them landed in the branches as well, and they sat, branch after branch, peering down at the eclectic mix of players beneath.Theyre the Sylphs I was talking about, Baduk whispered.Air spirits. 

Lisa couldnt seem to drag her gaze away from what appeared to be their leader.The sylph had tiny elf-like features, with pointed ears.But instead of silver hair, she had long, sparkling blue hair that seemed to flow into her wings: iridescent butterfly wings that sprung from her back and continued to flutter slowly.Her eyes were a deep purple, and they scanned the crowd as she slowly raised her arms to the sky.And against the pale skin of her upper arms, swirls of black ink that seemed to move, even as she watched.The crowd had fallen completely silent, and the Sylph lowered her arms.I am Mehluni, and I speak for our tribe. Her voice rang out loud and clear, seemingly carried outwards by the trees branches.It was a moment before Lisa realized that Mehluni wasnt speaking in English but rather in a language characterized by melodious calls with no distinguishable syllables or words, yet she could understand her nonetheless.It is with great sadness that I must speak with you all today, Mehluni continued as her gaze flickered over the crowd, and it is sad news I must bear. She paused for a moment, and the faint jingling of tiny silver bells that hung from all the Sylphs garments was the only sound that could be heard.Someone has poisoned the lake.We will perform a ceremony to find out who. 

This caused an explosion of cries to burst from the Sylphs in the trees.Some of the players noticeably tensed, their hands drawn to their weapons, while others tried to shove their way to the back of the crowd to escape.Dont let them leave! Mehluni cried, and dozens of Sylphs flitted towards the edges of the town square and began to chant.This time, Lisa couldnt make out any words, but before their very eyes, the air around the corners of the square began to spin, picking up the leaves from the ground and shredding them as it formed what seemed to be an impassable wall.This is bad, Kieran said, his gaze methodically sweeping around.No exits.He had never encountered a random event himselfthey never happened in the Marketplace, where he mainly residedbut he had heard of some of them before.And the ones he had heard of had resulted in player deaths.Whats bad? Ardissia asked.Baduk looked around nervously.So random events can either either have good outcomes or bad outcomes.Thats why theyre random.I think theyre usually goodfree weapons, celebration, etc.but every once in a while, its really bad.Usually ends in player deaths.Its purely RNG.The Sylph is just going to pick a random party and accuse them. 

Wait, that doesnt sound fai Ardissia began.Baduk shrugged.Hey, it sucks, but its just a matter of luck.Theres nothing left to do now except hold your breath and pray it isnt us. The chance that it would be them was small, of course.There were probably hundreds of players here, if not more.But there was a chance nonetheless.Player deaths? Lisa felt her heart rate speed up a little.It wouldnt be them, would it?It made sense now that the players would try to escape.Poisoning the lake seemed like a very serious accusation since the entire town depended on it.Be prepared.Ill teleport everyone out if something goes wrong. Kieran stepped closer to them, his gaze fixed on Mehluni.Under normal circumstances, this wouldnt be a problem at all.Lose a little gold, some stuff, no problem.But now, dying was a luxury they couldnt afford.Mehluni had joined in the chant with the other Sylphs, her eyes closed and her wings bringing her up in the air, slow wingbeats keeping her afloat.Then, her eyes shot open, and she pointed toward an area at the front of the crowd.Eurus has spoken!They have poisoned the lake! 

The wall of air disappeared.Lisa could feel herself getting jostled around as the crowd began to thin, some players heading further in towards the town while others left.The scapegoats had been picked, and it was no longer their problem, so they could continue the game as normal.Some of them threw the group of players at the front pitying looks but continued on their way.Lisa grabbed Ardissias hand and tugged them forward, ignoring Kierans sound of protest.It didnt take her long to see who the poor victims were because a small crowd was gathered in a semi-circle around them, though they left a decent gap between them and the offending party.Oh my god, its Lisa glanced around for Kieran, then tugged him forward.What? 

Its the dragon lady! The dragoness from the inn, with the purple scales and golden eyes.She looked identical to before, even the way her tail flicked angrily.Dragomir. 

Dragomir, right. But she wasnt really listening.She clapped a hand over Kierans mouth as he opened it to say something else.Shhhhh, theyre talking. 

He pried her hand from his mouth but became quiet.You will accept the punishment for poisoning the lake and be executed for your sins.

Its not ussss, the female Dragomir hissed angrily.Uvossa, you know its useless. One of the other Dragomirs touched her shoulder, but she shook it off, whipping around.Her eyes flashed.I didnt make it to this point for it all to be taken away by bad luck. EXP and gold was taken for each death as a percentage, and she couldnt afford to die or she would lose her standing on the leaderboard.She turned back toward Mehluni.Someone elssse must have done it.  

Mehluni narrowed her eyes, then laughed, the sound like a songbirds chirp.Is there anyone who would vouch for you? She gazed out over the remaining crowd.Players turned their heads, unwilling to meet her eyes.It was best not to get involved.Lisa was about to step forward when Kieran tugged her back.Dont, he whispered.We cant help them. 

Her eyes narrowed.She opened her mouth to say something, when she felt someone brush past her side.I can vouch for them. Her voice was soft, but the words came out clearly.Mehluni turned toward Ardissia, who stood there and took the sharp gaze, although Lisa could see her hand slightly shaking.You would vouch for them with your life? 

N Baduk stepped forward, but Ardissia stuck her first out backwards, managing to land a hit on his stomach so he didnt manage to make the whole word out.Yes.I would.  

Uvossa had turned around and was staring at Ardissia with an unfathomable expression, her gaze threatening to sear into her soul.Then, she gave the slightest nod.Mehluni laughed and turned back to Uvossa.If you find me the real criminal within three days, I will spare your punishment.Perhaps, she added, I will even give you a reward.Come, my darlings.Lets fly. 

Then, she crouched on the platform and shot up towards the sky along with the rest of the Sylphs.They were gone in the blink of an eye.The Dragomirs left as well, extending their wings and heading inwards toward the center of town.Ardissia collapsed in heap on the ground.Lisa moved forward to help her up, while Kieran took her other arm.Why did you do that? Kieran asked, his voice gruff.That was a dumb thing to do. 

With everything thats happened, how can we let someone die? 

Its none of our business.And you could have easily dragged our entire party into the mix.Did you even use your brain before you said that? His voice raised in irritation, even as his jaw clenched.Even if they died in real life?You wouldnt care?And I didnt.I would never endanger anyone else, even 

But you nearly did! he finally exploded.And its my job to make sure Lisa doesnt get in any danger.Thats it.You can do as you like, but I wont have any part of it. He stalked off, and Baduk gave them a glance before taking off after his friend.ImIm really sorry. Lisa knelt down next to her friend, whose legs had given way again, and hugged her from behind.He cares about you, you know, but hes just really protective of me.Its always been that way, and 

And hes an ass. Ardissia finished.She swiped at her cheeks, where tears had started to drip down.Hes a selfish ass who doesnt care about anyone.To think I even liked him. She sniffled and stood up.Thats fine.I dont need him anyway.We can solve this thing ourselves.

Yeah, Lisa said softly.Lets find a place to stay for tonight, and tomorrow we can start searching for clues."She looked toward the path lined with trees that Baduk and Kieran had walked down.Kieran really was beginning to worry her.*****

Marnie's eyes shot open.What was that?She clambered off of the stone, her head whipping back and forth as she tried to pinpoint the location of the sound.The others must have heard it too, right?Right, Anna!She turned to see what Anna was doing.It turned out she too was anxiously pacing back and forth at her spot.After a moment, Anna looked up and met Marnie's gaze.They stared at each other for just a second before Marnie nodded, and they were both sprinting downwards.It sounded like it had come from where Adam and Emilia were.It wasn't long before the giant oak tree came into view.Marnie glanced around, but she was the only one there."Adam!"she called out."Emilia!"Almost immediately afterwards, Anna and Lilith burst into view, followed by Kayn."What happened?""Where are the others?"Everyone was a mess of panic, calling out Adam and Emilia's names.Marnie ran toward the pond, calling out Emilia's name.But other than the cries of the others, there was no response.Her mind raced.What had happened?Were there bears or other predators out here in the woods?Did one of them fall?Suddenly, she noticed a patch of blue cloth sticking out from between two bushes.She silently walked towards it, peeling back the branches as she reached it.Her eyes widened, even as she breathed a small sigh of relief.Emilia was huddled in between them, her back towards Marnie, rocking back and forth on her toes and desperately pinning both hands against her ears.Marnie reached out a hand and tapped Emilia's arm gently.Emilia screamed--the loud, piercing scream they had heard earlier--her eyes popping open and falling to her hands and knees as she scrambled to get away."Emilia!"Marnie called."What's wrong?"Emilia suddenly froze, and then she turned around, and Marnie could finally see Emilia's tear-streaked, dirt-covered face and her shivering figure.Lilith appeared next to Marnie."What's wrong?"she asked, gulping in a breath.She had run off to see if they had moved elsewhere, only be drawn back here by the scream.Emilia's eyes widened at Lilith's appearance.Without hesitating, she sprinted into Lilith's arms, burying her face into the shoulder of the girl who was by appearance only a couple years older."What's wrong?"Lilith asked, her hand patting Emilia's back as she mouthed 'What happened?'toward Marnie.Marnie shook her head.She had no idea either.She felt a tap on her arm, and turned around to see Annie, the little girl's face serious as she looked at Emilia.It was several moments before Emilia had calmed down enough that her shoulders were no longer shaking.She finally stepped away from Lilith and brought her hands up to cover her arms."I saw it take him," she said."I'm so sorry.I couldn't do anything.I was so scared.""Saw who take who?"Lilith asked, her brows furrowing."I saw it take Adam," Emilia repeated, her words tripping over each other."It just...it wasn't even human.I...it appeared about of nowhere.It had this horrible putrid smell and it didn't even have a face and these long, grey limbs, and we thought if we just stayed still it wouldn't see us.Adam told me to run, and then it just grabbed him and ran off, and I--" She swallowed."I'm  so sorry, Adam," she whispered."I'm so sorry.""Emi, I need you to explain exactly what it looked like to me."Lilith brought her hands up to Emilia's shoulders, a sense of urgency in her voice."This is really important."Emilia shook her head."I didn't get a good look, I was so scared.It was just this grey thing with these four super long limbs and it walked on all four and it..." She seemed petrified at the recollection of its appearance."I...I'm sure it must have had a head but I didn't see it."Marnie turned to look at Lilith, whose face had turned an ashy pale color.Lilith whipped around, her eyes landing on Marnie and Anna before taking in their surroundings."Where's Kayn?"For the first time, Marnie heard a tinge of fear in her voice."I thought he was with us.""He went to search for them," Anna replied."I guess he's not bac--" Without waiting for her to finish, Lilith made to brush past her."Wait, what's going on?"Marnie interjected, grabbing onto Lilith's arm."What was that thing that Emilia was describing?It didn't sound human, or even animal, at all.You know what she's talking about, don't you?"Lilith closed her eyes."Fuck," she cursed under her breath."I thought we would be fine."Then with a deep breath, she turned to Marnie."Listen carefully.You know how I told you we had to be careful and that there were monsters?""I thought that was a joke," Marnie said.Lilith ignored her."I meant it.That...thing...that Emilia just described is something I've seen before.I don't know too much about them either.I've only seen them once.I..." She looked away then, towards the ground."There was another one of us here.His name was Nathaniel.He got taken by one of them.""You never mentioned him," Anna said.Lilith shook her head."There was no point.That monster that I saw...it was horrible.Huge.I told Mr. Hyde, and his guess is that it came through either from another universe.""Not from another universe," Anna cut in."From the void in between universes."Marnie blinked.The expression of such utter seriousness on a little girl's face was jarring."How do you know?"Lilith asked."Because we learned about them," Anna said."In my world.I was a scientist.They're called Rift Walkers.If you imagine the parallel universes layered on top of each other, there's still space in between them, no matter how close they are together.And Rift Walkers live in that space.That's why they have no face.There's nothing for them to see."Marnie fought down an expanding sense of terror.What was even happening?First she found out she invisible, and then it wasn't even that, it was that she was in some other universe, and now there were monsters?She wanted to curl up into a ball."What do we do now?"she finally asked.She glanced down at her watch.10:28 am."Why didn't you bring this up before?"Lilith's lips thinned as she glared at Anna."We could've used this information.""I didn't think they'd be able to come out from the void," Anna shot back."Anyways, we shouldn't be fighting.We should try and figure out where they've been taken.I think they're safe for now because the Rift Walker only has mouth like a straw, and they typically wait for their victims to be squished into a pulpy mess by the pressure in the void to eat them.""But where did it take them then?"Marnie asked."I have no clue," Anna admitted."Somewhere that has similar conditions as the void, I suppose.Dark and moist.That would be my best guess.We were studying one of them, and they didn't do well in the light.It's probably just waiting for the rift to open, like us.""What do we do now then?Do we search for them?"Marnie dragged a hand through her hair.What were they supposed to do with that clue?It could almost mean anywhere.They were literally out in the middle of nowhere on a *mountain* and--

Her head shot up."I think I have an idea where it might go."*****

*You need to make sure that all of you get back.Anna has run out of time, and it becomes more dangerous the longer you stay here.* 

The sun wasn't even up before Mr. Hyde had shooed them out of the house.Marnie glanced down at her watch.It was the only thing that was on her during the car crash, and it was the only thing that didn't crumble into dust when she tried to touch it.8:13 am.They still had plenty of time left.The points that Mr. Hyde had dotted on the map were all on a nearby mountain called Mount Tempus.Marnie didn't really remember coming down from a mountain after the car accident, but the events during that time period had been a huge blur, so she couldn't really guarantee she hadn't simply forgotten either.Lilith led the way, holding the map in one hand and a GPS in the other.She was somehow the only one who could touch the things from this world.Mr. Hyde hadn't really had an explanation for that one.But it worked out well for them.Otherwise Marnie really wasn't sure how they were supposed to find the exact locations.If it weren't for the fact that their situation was so preposterous--because really, who accidentally goes to another *dimension* from a car accident--it could have been a fun outing.The weather was nice, with a hint of warmth to it despite the fact that it was moving into fall.Happy little chirps came from the treetops around them in all directions.Or, at least, there should be warmth.In the last couple of months, she had gradually been losing the ability to feel differences in temperature, which was why Lilith's warm hands came as such a huge shock."We're all within a mile of one another.So we'll still be able to hear each other and help out if anything goes wrong," Lilith explained.She looked down at the GPS, then at the map again."Adam, you're right here next to this tree."Lilith pointed to an oak tree a little ways off the trail, and Adam walked toward it and sat down on the ground, his back leaning against the tree.He gave a little two finger salute to Lilith, who wrinkled her nose at his cheekiness.He ruffled his bangs a little, then closed his eyes."Alright, next is Emilia."Lilith squinted at the map."Wait, I think you're right next to Adam, almost.Walk over there."She pointed a little bit to the right of Adam."There should be pond.Let me know if you see it.You're right next to it."Emilia pushed her large glasses up further on the bridge of her nose."Lilith..." Her eyes grew misty as her nose slowly reddened."I'm going to miss you."She wrapped her skinny arms around Lilith, just short of breaking out into full fledged tears.Lilith patted Emilia's back."You're going to go back to your family," she cooed."Everything will be alright.I'll be with you until the end."Emilia nodded a little, then dejectedly turned and walked out of view."I found the pond," she called out."Alright!Talk to Adam," Lilith called back."I'm leading the others to their spots!And if you need anything, just yell!"Next came Anna and Kayn, who were a little further away from the others.Anna simply gave a little nod as she was dropped off, while Kayn gave Marnie a wink before settling in.Marnie blushed when Lilith waggled her eyebrows at her."I think he kind of likes you," Lilith whispered after Kayn was out of earshot."That's ridiculous," Marnie sputtered."He doesn't know anything about me."And judging from Anna's age, he could be a 30 year old man.Marnie shuddered at the thought.Lilith laughed, a sound like tinkling bells."He also landed two years ago, if you're wondering about his age.And,"--she looked Marnie up and down, and Marnie suddenly felt self conscious about her appearance again--"you're cute.I'd tap that," she said, giving Marnie a quick peck on the cheek before turning her attention back to the map.Marnie brought her hand up to her cheek.The feeling of warm wetness had been startling, but not unpleasant.She blushed, running to catch up with Lilith."Okay, you're here."Lilith stamped her sneaker on the grass patch in an x-marks-the-spot kind of way and gazed around them."You've got a nice view," she said.Marnie glanced around.It was true.She was on higher ground than the rest of them, and she could see the greenery laid out beneath her.With the tree leaves turning red and orange and yellow, it made for a beautiful sight.Unfortunately, the trees blocked her view so she could only really see Anna--Anna saw her as well and waved--it was nice being able to see at least someone."Alright, any questions?"Marnie didn't really know what to say, so she shook her head.Lilith glanced at her watch.9:28 am.Still plenty of time, but better safe than sorry."I'll go find my spot first.If all looks good, I'll be back up to visit you."She winked, then bounded off through the trees.Marnie exhaled a large breath.She looked back and sat down on the large rock, feeling its rough, grainy texture beneath her palms.It hadn't really sunk in until now.She had always been vaguely aware of just how crazy this all was, but now she could finally take a moment and breathe.Was she...truly going home?So she could see her parents again?And her friends?She laid down on the rock, and though she was unable to feel the warmth of the sunlight against her skin, the beautiful scenery and the sounds of birds chirping slowed her heartbeat until her eyelids drooped and she began to nod off.It had been a long time since the weather had been so nice, with no ashy flakes falling from the sky.And even longer since she'd felt so calm and peaceful, the relative silence lulling her to sleep as she dreamt of going home.Until the peace was broken by a piercing and bloodcurdling shriek.*****

What are we here for? Uvossa glanced around.Mehluni had sent letters to their rooms the night before, requesting their appearance at the square.Oh, youll like it, I think, Ardissia said cheekily.Uvossas golden eyes flashed for a moment.But before she could ask, the ground beneath their feet began to tremblenot hard enough to be alarming, but just enough to catch them off guard.Ardissia, who was standing next to Kieran, threw her arms out quickly to steady herself, then threw out her whip toward Lisa upon noticing her nearly lose her balance.Lisa threw a grateful glance over to her friend, then unwrapped the end of the whip once she caught her balance.Her eyes widened when she glanced at her wrist.No broken skin, not even redness.And now that she thought about it, it hadnt even hurt when the whip touched her skin.It was almost unbelievable how much control Ardissia had developed over her whip in the short span of three months.Lisa caught movement in the corner of her eye, and when she turned, her eyes widened at the scene in front of her.The trees trunk wasunraveling, like different strands of fibers twisting and unraveling apart.Kieran gaze stopped at the base of the tree.So that was what was causing the ground to shake.The root system was rearranging itself to allow the trunk to expand.Interesting.He looked toward Lisa and Ardissia to make sure they were okay, one hand out to keep his balance while the other rested on Baduks shoulder.Moments later, the movement stopped, and they were faced with a gaping hole in the center of the tree trunkan entrance.They all looked at one another, slightly hesitant.All except Baduk, who seemed unfazedeven slightly boredby the entire event.Without missing a beat, he immediately walked toward the entrance.Come on, guys. There was a hint of excitement to his voice.Everyone filed in after him.It turned out that the darkness wasnt a true, pitch black because second her eyes adjusted, Lisa could see the small pinpricks of light that filtered through the tiny gaps in the folds of the trunk.They walked down several flights of stairs until the spiraling stairwell gave way to a cavernous room, the domed walls seven meters high and completely constructed from what appeared to be the trees roots.Twined roots sprouted from the walls like branches, decorated with leaves and flowerswhich Lisa could only assume was possible through sylphan magicserving as benches for the sylphs flitting about them.Different from the luminous leaves above ground that had a blue-green tint to them, these seemed to glow a white-yellow.And in the very center, a billowing tent, its flap open.Come in, Mehlunis voice rang out from the tent over the chatter of the sylphs, and one by one, they walked in.The inside was sparsely decorated, with a simple yet ornate leaning couch towards the back, and in the center, a birdbath, from which dozens of tiny birds were drinking.Out of the corner of her eye, Lisa saw Ardissias lips move slightly, and then she felt a buzz at her hip.*How did the birds even get in here???* Ardissias voice sounded in her ear, and Lisa almost shrugged in response.She turned her head to Ardissia.I dont know, she mouthed back, not bothering with sending a message.Mehlunis lips seemed to curve upwards, as if she knew what the exchange was about.But she said nothing, simply standing up from the couch and walking towards them.She stopped several paces away, her wings folding downwards.A buzz.*Its a gesture of respect,* Baduk explained.Thank you for helping us.We appreciate everything youve done, truly. She bowed her head, and Lisa could see the dark silver ink emblazoned against the skin of her pale, elegant necka vine-like design that wrapped all the way around.Lisa blinked.How had she never noticed that before?Then Mehluni stood upright, and she understood.The ink glimmered for a moment, then faded from view.Mehlunis gaze flickered across each of them in turn, finally stopping at Uvossa.Please, take this as a token of our appreciation and apologies. She reached into the folds of her tunic and pulled out a small wooden, pebble-like disc, with an indentation in the center and a hole slightly behind it, and placed her lips on it, blowing gently.A soft, high pitched noise came from the object, and moments later, a young sylph appeared in the doorway, holding eleven tiny glasses of clear, iridescent liquid on a wooden tray.Baduks eyes lit up, and he tugged on Kierans sleeve so hard he nearly lost his balance.Kieran gave his friend an inquisitive look, but the halfling didnt say anything, just let a huge grin spread across his face.This isnt something we bring out very often, but I think this counts as a special circumstance. Mehluni had a smile on her face as she watched Baduk, then turned to him.Would you like to do the honors? 

Baduk nodded furiously.Sylphan lore calls it the Cup of Life, the reason being that, sometimes sylphs will be born without wings or lose them in battle, and if the leader of a tribe gives them blessed water, they not only get stat increases, but they grow *wings.* So its like being reborn.Ive only heard of this on the forums, its so rare, and in the past year, its 

Ive only given it away to one other player, Mehluni interrupted before Baduk could pass out from excitement.She turned to Kieran.He was an elf, like you.He Then she smiled and shook her head.Its unimportant.He did a great thing for us, and were forever indebted to him.  

Kieran cocked his head but didnt say anything.After a moment, he finally said, Its an honor. 

What happensss if we already have wingsss? Uvossa let her wings flare out a touch, then retracted them again.Then they will grow stronger, Mehluni replied, her gaze flitting from the sylph toward them.The young sylph walked in front of each person in turn, allowing them to take a cup from the tray.When everyone had received their cup, Mehluni nodded, and they downed the liquid.It tasted like water, but it burned as it went down, and Lisa barely suppressed a cough.The reaction disappeared in a second, but she glanced over to see whether anyone else had felt the same thing.Almost everyone had a look on their face that was a cross between a smile and a grimace, except Kieran, who remained expressionless.A moment later, she felt it.An itch just beneath her shoulder blades that was intolerable, then vanished just as quickly as it came.She heard Ardissia gasp and whipped around.Her eyes widened at the wingsbrilliant and bold, they resembled the long plumage of a peacock, excepted dusted a light silver and blue.Her mouth dropped open, and she didnt even notice when Kieran reached over to push her jaw up.It was only when Ardissias gaze shot from her to Kieran and shifted from wonder to confusion that she turned to look.She blinked.Then again.She reached out her hand and swiped at the empty air behind his back to confirm that it wasnt her imagination.Where are your wings? she blurted out.Lisa Kieran gazed at her, his lips pressed together, a strained expression on his face.Lisa felt the back of her throat close up and she looked away.This world had been so unbelievable, so unreal, that she had almost forgotten.And in this moment that should have been joyous, it felt like a slap in the face.Kieran looked up and happened to meet Mehlunis gaze.Her face held an expression of surprise, but not shock.It was almost strange howunsurprised she was?Has this happened before? Baduk asked right before he could.He himself had grown a pair of tan sparrow wings that matched his complexion almost perfectly.Baduk gave his friend a worried look.At the same time, Lisa reached over and clasped her palm in his.The little gesture made his heart twinge a little bit.She used to do it all the time whenever she felt he needed support, and her little chubby, warm palm always made him feel better.It was probably the thing he missed the most.Once Mehluni said, then blinked.Her face reddened slightly, and she looked away.There was something he was missing.Kieran frowned.Something about her reaction was definitely throwing him off, but he couldnt pinpoint exactly what it was.Her eyes had fogged over, a faraway look in them.There was a link he was missing

Mehluni! A sylph shot through the doorway.When he saw the rest of them, he stopped in his tracks, then walked the rest of the way up to Mehluni before whispering something in her ear.Her expression dimmed.They were politely but firmly excused out, then escorted to the border of the town.None of the sylph escorts said a word, only guided them out before bowing and making their leave, flitting off within seconds.Perhaps, on another day, he might have fought harder to figure out what was going on, but Kieran had a ball in the pit of his stomach that he just couldnt shake.With a lingering sense of doom, Kieran glanced back at the tree-line before turning his gaze to the horizon.It was probably nothing.Probably.*****
