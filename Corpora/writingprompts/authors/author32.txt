“Hey, right now, what do you want?”

I look at our little town, at the lights flickering on and off, all the little lives and stories I knew and didn’t know and would never know. It was a rare warm night, the weather just one of the many perfect things I’d remember about it.

Graduation was yesterday, and tonight there was a big old party everyone was going to. But that wouldn’t have been the right way to end our childhood. So instead, we’d done what we did most weekend nights, climbed to the top of the hill with the water tower and sat on top, smoking a joint.

“I don’t want anything else. This night is perfect.”

She hits me, gently. “Tell the truth. I thought best friends weren’t supposed to lie to each other.”

“Seriously,” I say. “This is everything.”

“Well, look at me when you say it,” she says.

This is what I dreaded. I look into her eyes, her wide open, unblinking eyes, ready to take on the world, and I fall in love all over, the way I always do when I look at her. The way I always wonder if she chooses to hang out with a loser like me just because I’m her neighbor and she feels pity for me, with all the popular guys at school asking her out all the time.

And for a second, I feel it coming, the words I’m never able to say. The words I can’t. But then it passes.

“Nothing more. Really. This is perfect.”

She looks into my eyes for another second, knowing that’s not all of it, and then shrugs, and takes the joint.

\-

The next night, she moved east, and life was easy again. I think maybe that’s why I loved her - because she made things hard, made me think about the things I said, and what I wanted.

So when she left, and as the moments we’d had eroded the way memories do with time, so did the complications in my life. Everyone and everything else in my life was uncomplicated – my friends, family, desires. I like to think I have some moral code at least, and so I didn’t say anything that would take something away from someone who deserved it, or make someone do something they wouldn’t normally do, but I took all I wanted from life, and more.

When my friend Tim got laid off, I got him a new position I’d invented – right above the manager who had laid him off. When the Celtics were in game 7 of the finals, I made Jaylen Brown’s last second layup roll in, even if it took a freak bounce to do so. When my mom got Alzheimer’s, I removed the disease entirely from existence.

I was no hero. I’d always rationalized that I shouldn’t change the world too much, because who was I to play God, but looking back, maybe one could say I lived selfishly. But oh well. I was able to be happy, and make the people around me happy, and that’s all you can ask for.

Right?

\-

In the end, my favorite moments are those in which I don’t have to change anything. Like that night – when the mood, the temperature, the birds chirping in the air, the smell of grass are all just perfect.

There’s a little park near where I live that is beautifully maintained, and sometimes in the evenings when I have nothing else to do, I like to sit there, and watch life go by.

“Jorge?” she says. And just like that, it all comes back.

I stand up, and we hug, and she sits down, and we catch up. She only has a couple minutes. She’s here to see her sister, who just got divorced.

“Divorce,” I say. “That’s something that should never happen.”

She laughs. “Right? You sound like you’ve been through it.”

“Nope. And I never will. You?”

She shakes her head. “Never had the opportunity to.”

We fall into a silence after that, watching the sky turn orange for a glorious second, and then fade.

“Can I ask you something?” she says.

“Anything.”

“I’m not sure if you remember, but that night-“

“Of course I remember. All the time.”

“Were you telling the truth back then?”

I close my eyes, and try to imagine that night again. “We are back on the hill, on a night like that night.”

And suddenly, we are. She gasps.

“Don’t worry,” I say. “I’ll bring us back. But…I just wanted to show you. Everything I say…it happens. And back then, what I wanted most in the world was for us to be together, and to be in love. But if I said it, then it would have been true. And that’s something that should only have been true if it really was. It wouldn’t have been right to make it true when it wasn’t. Does that make sense?”

She’s still in shock, and doesn’t say anything for a minute. “But what if it really was true?”

Now I’m in shock, and I can’t say anything.

Finally, I figure out the words. “You tell me.”

She smiles, and then everything I ever wanted comes true.“You look nervous.”

Eric turned around, and saw a man in a bright blue baseball cap smiling at him.

“Here to cash in my life minimum check.”

“Wow. Did you get a good haul?”

“I don’t know,” Eric said.

He had waited until he was at the bank before opening up the check. When there was only one person ahead of him in line, he opened it.

*$7.27.*

Before he could react or anything, a voice called him to the window.

“How can I help you today?” A smiling, pretty woman named Mandy asked.

He didn’t know what to say. “I-I…”

A frown. “Are you okay, sir?”

He took a deep breath, and nodded. “Yeah. I just got my life minimum check today, and…the number was surprising.”

“In a good or bad way?”

He showed her the check.

“I was so excited to get it,” Eric said, a little sadly. “I was even thinking about where I was going to get lunch. I guess I can get one sandwich from Subway, and then if I kill myself, everything works out.”

She laughed, a little. “Are you sure it’s not a mistake? You can appeal these kinds of –“

A scream, in the bank. Eric turned around, and stared down the barrel of a gun. He followed the barrel down a man’s arm, down to a face under a bright blue baseball cap.

“Give it to me,” the man said.

“What?”  
“Whatever the check was worth.”

“Sir, it wasn’t much.”

The robber jabbed the gun into Eric’s forehead. “I don’t care. Give it to me.”

“Sir, look at it. It’s only seven dollars,” Mandy said, waving the check frantically in the robber’s face.

The robber looked at it for a second, his eyes unblinking and in shock as well.

“I don’t know what kind of life they expect you to live,” he muttered before turning and running out of the bank.

\-

The next day, Eric received another check in the mail. This time, he didn’t wait before opening it.

\-

She was in line at Subway. He tapped her on the shoulder.

“Thanks so much for saving me yesterday,” he said.

“It would have been a waste all over $7.27.”

“True,” he said. “So are you saying it wouldn’t have been a waste if it was more money?”

“Maybe,” she said. “Are you here to get that sandwich?”

He thought about telling her about the other check, about the two commas. “Of course. Actually…can I get you one too?”

“I thought you only had enough for one.”

“Fuck that. Since when did we let a piece of paper tell us how much we’re worth?”*We got along, in the way that kids can always find a way to get along. We played all kinds of games in the summer time, deep into the night, when our parents would come looking for us, worried about the reports of werewolves in the woods.*

*Our favorite game was the lava game. She would cast a spell and make the ground around the playground look like lava that would rise. The goal was to close your eyes and try to tag the other person, all without falling into the lava.*

*We’d play until we were too tired, and could do nothing but lay on top of the slide, staring up at the stars, feeling like we were on top of the world.*

*“What do you want to be when you grow up?” I once asked her.*

*“I don’t know. What about you?”*  
*“I don’t want to grow up. I wish we could play this game forever.”*

*“Me too.”*

\-

Nowadays, I stay away from magic. I stay away from most things, really. I’m looking to save up enough to get away from this town. Hopefully I can get out from this cursed place by the time I’m 30.

So I live a simple life. I go to work, I come home, I cook, I read, and I sleep. Most nights, before I sleep, I take a walk through the neighborhood, trying to see the town I used to love.

A lot of the time, there is a cat who walks besides me. He’s different than the other ones, because his black fur seems to shine even in the dark. He walks behind me and softly purrs, and if he’s still there when I get to the store, I get a milk for us to share. I’ve named him Aaron, for all those Aaron Burr milk ads back in the day.

Recently, though, he’s been looking skinny.

\-

*When we were thirteen, things started to change. We still spent time together, but we didn’t play the lava game as much.*

*“What do you want to do tonight?” I asked one night, in her room, as she put on her makeup.*

*“I don’t know. What about you?”*

*“The park again? And if we do go to the park, do you really need all that makeup?”*

*She put it down, and sighed. She looked off into the distance for a moment, contemplating something.*

*“We’re growing up,” she finally said. “Don’t you think it’s time to admit it?”*

*“What do you mean?”*  
*“I mean…Tim from down the street asked me out tonight.”*  
*“And? Are you going?”*

*“I think so…it’s the time to go after experiences like this. We’re becoming adults. Shouldn’t we take advantage of it? Life's too short to spend running around like a kid, wasting time, you know?”*

*I didn’t understand what she meant. But as I started to see her in more and more cars that summer, laughing at some new guy’s dumb jokes, I did understand that she was gone.*

\-

I thought about this, sitting on the jungle gym, smoking a joint, waiting to feel tired enough to sleep.

The cat makes its way next to me.

“What a hit?” I ask. I hold the joint up to it. The cat merely purrs, and looks away.

Then I notice something, in the fur. I’d always wondered who owned the cat, but I’d never seen any hint of who it could be. But nowadays Aaron is skinny, and his fur is matted, and his bones are showing too.

It was a keychain, with a tag and a key.

*Bring to Cecilia at 1215 Grove if found.*

\-

There was a sign on the door.

*Use the key to open if found.*

I knocked, and waited. There was no answer. I took the key off Aaron’s neck, and open the door.

She is standing there, almost like she’s been waiting. She slowly walks to me, and puts her arms around me.

“It’s you,” she whispers. “I always hoped it was you.”  
“What are you talking about?”  
“The man who finds this key gets to ask for my heart.”

“What?”

She nods, excitedly. “The rule is that you get one wish, so let’s get it over with.”

“I can ask…for anything I want?”

“Anything at all,” she whispers seductively. She used to practice that voice, that summer when we were 13. It makes me a little sad that she’s perfected it.

Aaron nudges my leg. I look down, and smile, the confusion solidifying into direction as I see him.

“Can I ask for Aaron?”

“What?”

“Your cat. Not judging, but I've grown pretty fond of him, and I think he could use some better care. Don’t you?”

\-

from a couple weeks ago.The first one hurt the worst, and I always thought it would always be that way. There wasn’t anything particularly special about Jeff. He was just a nice guy, thoughtful and a good listener.

That last night, we had shared a joint on the balcony.

“I’m going to miss this,” he said with a goofy smile. “All the weed I buy, you have to smoke so much of it. One hit of this, and I’m flying.”

“What do you mean? Miss it?”

“I’m leaving in a couple minutes,” he said.

“To your room?”

“No, man. Off the compound. I’m going back to Riverside.”

“When are you coming back?”

He put out the joint, and smiled, but sadly this time. “You’re a good kid. You’re not like the rest of them. For what it’s worth, I hope you stay that way.”

“Why are you leaving?”

“Ask your father,” he said with a shrug. “And I’m to have to have no contact with you from now on. But I want you to know I really did enjoy our time together.”

And then he shook my hand, patted me on the back, and left.

\-

Jeff was the first friend I’d ever made, and the first one I lost. After that, there were so many. At first, I didn’t realize what was going on, and I still treated them like they weren’t only there because my dad was paying them. And maybe some of them started to feel that way to. We shared drinks, basketball games out back, hikes in the woods.

But they all left, after one month. They came on the 5th, and left on the 4th. Without fail. Somewhere along the way, I closed off.

\-

I won’t say I fell in love with her. I wouldn’t know what love was if it smacked me in the face, living in this family. My own mother has never given me a hug or a kiss. My dad shakes my hand when he’s proud of me.

But her, the first time she saw that waterfall. All the others acted amazed, whether they were or not.

*“So?” I asked.*

*“It’s nice,” she said.*

*“You don’t sound that excited.”*

*“I guess…because I’m not.”*

*“Why not?”*

*“When I was young, my mother took me to see Niagara Falls. Have you heard of it?”*

*“I’ve seen it too. In textbooks.”*

*She shook her head. “There’s a whole world out there. And you deserve to see it. Everyone does.”*

From that point on, she would tell me about all the things she saw outside, big and small, amazing and mundane. The sheer heights of Yosemite Valley. The way the skatepark near her house would fill with water after a big storm, and her sisters and brothers would use it as a makeshift pool, knowing how precious the moments in the sun were as it evaporated before their eyes. The smile of the baker down the block, and how happy he looked every time his cakes were complimented.

“That sounds amazing,” I’d say. “I wish I could see it.”

“You can,” she said, and I would start to think, maybe I could.

But the 4th drew closer and closer.

\-

“Father,” I asked finally, sitting in his big study, watching him write some important report. He was always writing some important report. “Why do all my servants leave?”“Because they’ve outgrown their usefulness.”

“But why? I want an answer this time, an actual one.”

He stopped writing, and took off his glasses.

“You really want the truth, son?”

“Yes. Nothing less.”

“Ok. The reason they leave is because they become your friends.”

“And what’s so bad about that?”

“Because if you want to be successful in this world, you can’t be friends with people who work for you.”“Why not?”

“Because they’ll never see you as friends. And I didn’t get to where I am in life by making friends, or by trying to do that. And that's that.”

But what was so wrong with that?

\-

It was her last night. She sat by the window, quiet.

“What are you going to do now?” I asked.

“I don’t know. Maybe…travel the world, see more of the places we always talk about. I wish…”

“Wish what?”

“Nothing,” she said, smiling to diffuse the moment. “This last month has been really nice. You were a good boss.”

“Are we friends?” I asked before I could stop myself.

“What?”

“Am I just your boss, or…” I didn’t know what I wanted to ask.

“You’re not. Not just my boss,” she said, seriously. “Oh god, have you thought that this whole time?”

“No. But I’ve been scared of it.”

She looked outside. “What else are you scared of?”

“The world out there. And seeing it with you. I’m scared that if I don’t get that, I’ll regret it forever.”

“Then let’s go,” she says. “Why not?”

And for once, I’m glad one question in my life has no good answer.3 days old

Papa says Mr. Rogers wasn’t always the way he is. He says there’s nothing wrong with him, just that I should know he was different.

“Different how?” I ask.

“He didn’t always have to sit down like he does now. He didn’t always cough.”

“Why does he cough?”

“He’s sick, son,” Papa says, staring out the window. I wonder if he is looking at the brightness of the stars, or the darkness behind them. “That’s what his kind do when they are sick.”

“Am I sick? Will I be sick?”

Papa looks at me now, and smiles. I don’t know it now, but I will remember this smile when I think of my father, a smile unlike how he taught me to smile, a smile mixed with sadness too.

“We all get sick, son.”

\-

2 weeks old

It was only after I had grown to my final height that I began to realize why Papa was so deeply affected by Mr. Rogers.

“I met your great-great grandfather, you know,” he says with a coy smile, laying on his bed. His eyes are glazed the way humans’ eyes get, to the point I no longer know if he sees me, or something else. “You remind me so much of him.”

“You’ve known my whole family,” I say.

“I’ve known them more than mine.”

“I’m sorry to hear that, sir.”

He takes my hand, and squeezes it. I don’t know why, but the nurse told me at the visitors’ desk that this is an important thing humans do.

“It’s been an absolute joy. Your father, did he…”

“He passed yesterday, sir.”

“I’m sorry. I should have been…that’s the worst part. I’m never able to grow old with any of you. I should be.”

“Well, maybe you’ll get your chance with me, sir.”

“I’d like that.”

\-

One month old

Now I’m in a bed next to Mr. Rogers. We are both too weak to look at each other, but somehow that doesn’t matter. We know the other is here, and that’s all you need, right?

“Mr. Rogers…can I ask you why you picked that name? My father told me you had a different name.”

“Mr. Rogers is a man I used to watch back on my home planet, when I was a boy, if you can believe that was ever true. And he taught me everything I know. About life, about family...And somewhere along the roads of my life, I lost the values he taught me. So when I met your family, I did what Mr. Rogers would have done. I gave myself a second shot.”

“Family…why don’t you ever speak of your family, sir?”

“Because…there’s nothing to say. They were perfect. We were like any other family, until I messed it up with my addiction. We loved each other, and hated each other sometimes, and cried and laughed and grew together. Like yours.”

“Do you think it hurts, sir? The very end?”

“I don’t think so.”

I try to find the right words to say, to thank him for everything he’s done for us.

“I’m sorry you won’t get to see the future you helped build,” I say. “You deserve that, at least.”

“The thing is…I can see it, when I close my eyes. I’ve always been able to see it. If I didn’t teach your family what you needed to know, you would have learned yourselves. I can imagine it now, when we find the perfect planet...”

"Still, sir...you saved us. We all know that."

"We saved us, son."

There is one final question, one I desperately want to ask. But I don’t, because I would never want to be asked it.

So he answers it for me.

“It doesn’t hurt, kid…being the last one of my kind.”

I look over at him now, with the last of my strength. He wears that same smile, the one he taught my father, the one that somehow says more than you could ever say with words.

“Because I found a family…”“Beauty is what stops people in their tracks. No matter what they are doing, if they having the best day or worst day of their life, if they are in love, if they are in pain, they will stop to look at beauty.”

“But beauty fades, mother,” Cupid said, his eyes still burning with that youthful fire, the idealism that would never fade. “Love is like water. It can come and go, but it always there. Inside of you. You must work at beauty, obsess over it, wonder whether or not you have enough of it. Love can fill your spirit like nothing else.”

“But no person can deny beauty. People can deny love for duty, for purpose, for art. But they cannot say no to beauty.”

Cupid said nothing. Venus could get particularly nasty when pushed into a corner, and had an underrated penchant for revenge.

“We’ll see, shall we, son? Let’s have a wager about your two favorite souls in this world…”

\-

Cupid watched the man walk past the café for the umpteenth time, and the fire dimmed a little bit more inside of him. He watched the woman, the other half of the man’s soul, as she watched from the café window, bored and tired from another long day of work.

This incarnation of them would have gone like any of the other ones, save for his mother’s intrusion. It was perfect. He had started coming in to work on his sketches, and she would give him tips and hints, each of them brightening the other’s day.

But then Venus had put the model in the man’s life, and he had fallen quickly, spending all his time and money on this new beauty. The barista was pretty, but the model was a knockout, a face destined to be photographed. The man was infatuated, devoted, but not in love.

How could the man not see what was in front of him? They were made for each other, as they had always been. They were both artists, seeing beauty in the world around them, in a telephone pole, in a bicycle, in a palm tree, wondering how they could get everyone else to see what they wanted. They were both kind to a fault, their feelings hurt when others told them they were too nice, too naïve. They were both lonely, wondering if there was anyone else out there like them…

Cupid wondered if he should get involved. It was too painful to watch this, the man forced to take pictures, wear a smile just because he couldn’t look away from the model’s face. But still:

*“Love can be pushed into a corner, but the truest form, it will always find a way.”*

That is what he always believed. Sometimes, he had to shoot an arrow to save a marriage or spur a shy kid into action, but mostly, he loved to watch. Love was one of the unseen forces in the universe, along with gravity and inertia. You had to trust it.

But his trust was fading.

\-

“Maybe you’ve won, mother,” Cupid said.

“Of course I did,” Venus said, a smug smile on her face as she ruffled her son’s hair.

“I really thought they would always be together. That café is where they are supposed to fall in love.”

“There’s no supposed to, son. There’s just beauty, and the quest to obtain it.”

“I guess you’re right.”

“Don’t feel bad. There’s a reason you are my son. You see, love is just how you appreciate beauty.”

*It’s more than that,* Cupid thought even as he nodded in agreement.

\-

Cupid was in the city again. A woman had fallen off the wagon and cheated with her boss, and now she was on her way home. Cupid was there to shoot an Arrow of Honesty into her heart, and hopefully make the confession go smoothly.

Then he saw the man, sitting on a bench, with the woman approaching. He lowered his bow, and tuned in to their conversation.

“Hi,” she said. “Do you remember me?”

The man looked up, and smiled, as if finally remembering his identity after a bout of amnesia. “Of course. I’ve been meaning to come back in, but I didn’t get the chance.”

“You never come in anymore. You used to come in with that girl. What was her name?”

“We broke up,” he said. “She wasn’t right for me.”

“That’s too bad,” the girl said. “What are you sketching?”

“A bluebird. I was actually just walking, and then I saw it, and it stopped me in my tracks, you know?”

“Really? Bluebirds are my favorite. Want some help? My dad used to take me bird watching when I was a kid.”

“That’s be great…”

Cupid smiled, wishing he could stick around and watch. But he turned around, and had no doubts as he did so. After all, love always finds a way. You just had to trust it.Something is wrong, or maybe it’s right. Either way, the day is perfect, too perfect and vivid for any ordinary dream. The hill behind our house in the suburbs of LA when I was a kid, with the skyline and those lights just peaking out over the hills in the distance. The fading warmth and sunlight, just like all the nights I spent out there watching the sunset with only the company of a joint, wishing…

“Hi,” she says, and her smile is perfect too. She sits on the tire swing, the dusty, barely hanging swing my father and I put there so many years ago. Or when was it, in this dream?

“Do I know you?” I ask.

“Of course you do. Who am I?”

“The girl of my dreams.” And she really is. Light freckles sprinkled like stardust, hair looking like it’s on fire in the dying light. And the eyes, like staring into the greenest emerald you could ever see. Eyes I could stare into forever, and feel like I’d wasted no time at all.

“Why are you here?”

“Why do you think?” she asks. “To fall in love with you.”

“And I’m supposed to fall in love with you?”

“Of course,” she says.

“That doesn’t really feel right to me. I have a girlfriend. We’re getting pretty serious. And we work together too.”

“And that’s enough? Deep down, you know. You two are only settling, because it’s that time when people are supposed to settle down so all their friends and parents will stop annoying them. And eventually you’ll start to hate each other, and hate yourselves for settling.”

It’s scary how right she is. I say nothing.

“I scare you, don’t I? Because that’s what you’ve always wanted the girl of your dreams to do. To tell you what you know, but don’t want to admit…”

\-

What was I supposed to do? When your dreams come knocking, you answer.

I did get married to my girlfriend, out of some sense of obligation to someone. Maybe my parents. Maybe my sense of guilt for cheating on her in some way.

But was it really cheating on her? In my dreams, everything I wanted came true. We fulfilled everything, from childhood dreams to explore Narnia to becoming a beloved writer to searching for the Infinity Stones in the galaxies with the Avengers. And we were together the whole time.

My waking hours became sleep, merely a buffer to pass the time until I could return to my dreams. I lived lifetimes with her, new lifetimes every night, each starting and ending at the swing on the hill behind my house…

\-

“How did you get here?” I ask her, sitting on the swing, watching the sky fade like a dying phoenix. Our time together is winding down yet again, after a lifetime sailing the seas.

“What do you mean?” she asks.

“I mean…where do you go when I wake up?”

“I don’t know,” she says. "I guess I go to sleep, too."

“Can I ask you not to come anymore?”

She is silent, for a long time. There are moments like these, that suggest to me that maybe she has feelings too, that she isn’t just some manifestation of my desires and lost hopes.

“Why?”

“Because my girlfriend and I are thinking of having kids soon, and it wouldn’t feel right…”

Surprisingly, she doesn’t protest.

“Ok,” she says, her voice choked up. “If that’s what you want.”

“I’ll always love you,” I say.

“Me too,” she says. And as the sky fades, I close my eyes, and hold her tightly…

\-

I’ve lived a good life. Or at least, anyone else who looks at my life would say so. I worked diligently to provide for my family, and was faithful to my wife, and put in time with my kids. One of them even grew up to be a decently successful author himself, and that makes me almost as happy as if I had succeeded myself.

But truth be told…I’ve always wondered. Did I make a mistake, letting her go like that? I guess maybe everyone in life has a choice like that at some point, duty or your dreams, and lots of people make the same choice as me.

My family is here with me, at the end. I smile, and I am genuinely happy. It touches me to see all their tears, and feel their warm hugs.

I close my eyes.

When I open them, they are gone. And…

“Did you miss me?” she asks, smiling broadly.

“How are you here?”

“Come on,” she says. “I have someplace to show you. Although I think you’ve been there before…”For a man with no direction, my gaze doesn’t tend to sway very often. When I am on a delivery, I move through countless environments. The subway, the street, the malls, the apartments, all those people, and yet almost all of the time I look straight, my mind somewhere else.

*“I’m sorry,” she says, hugging me hard, the way she does when I come home too late at night, or with cuts from the bullies at school.*

*“Where are you going, mommy?”*

*“Somewhere very far,” she says. I feel a tear, hot and warm, drip down onto my neck as she retreats.*

*“When will you come back?”*

*“I don’t know.”*

*“Will you come back?”*

*Her lips tremble, and I feel fear, fear at realizing that for the first time, she cannot put a smile on for my sake.*

*“I will,” she says, finally, her voice shaking, her brown-flecked eyes trembling. “I promise.”*

*“Okay.”*

*“Do you believe Mommy?” This time, I get the feeling she isn’t asking for a specific answer, but rather that she genuinely does not know.*

*“Of course, mommy! I’ll miss you.”*

*“I’ll miss you too. So much, you don't even know…”*

*That was the last I saw of her.*

I wonder what she would think of me now, lethargic and lost, no longer even searching for an aim, falling deeper and deeper into a life she would be ashamed of. Ever since that night, I have felt like I have been waiting for her to come back…to tell me what to do.

Sometimes, during the day, I stop, just to catch my breath. I dip my head, close my eyes, and imagine that when I raise it, she will be there…

*The first time happened in a park, as I moved to sit down and take a break before my final batch.*

*The park is almost empty. I close my eyes, take a deep breath, and look up. Will she be older? Does she still wear glasses? Will she recognize me?*

*The force comes suddenly, and all the wind is knocked out of me as I lay sprawled on the ground.*

*Hands move swiftly over my body, firm but not too intrusive. Fingers on my neck, to check a pulse.*

*“Blocked, sir. Contact not made,” a voice says. I open my eyes to see a man leaving, without even a glance back to see if I am okay.*

*I look up, around the park. It is completely empty.*

So began the attacks. I reported it to the police once, who then asked to inspect my backpack to make sure I wasn’t involved in “illegitimate activities for a young man.” I had gotten up and left after that.

Even trying to isolate myself in public, it doesn’t work. At McDonald’s, on the train, at the grocery store, on the block my dingy apartment is. They come dressed in black, and that is all I ever see of them.

But today, I saw him, as I raised my head at the crosswalk. He was coming at a diagonal, from my left, and I waited, hearing his footsteps get louder and louder, and…I jump back, and look up. I see his body lunge, and crumple to the ground, his eyes wide with shock at having missed. I am about to take off running, when I see, across the street...

She takes off her glasses. At first, I don’t believe it’s her. A second passes, an eternity. My heart, my head, they don't know how to react.

And then looks at me for a moment, her eyes speaking even across the street, and smiles, a smile to fill in all the memories of her that have faded throughout the years…“Sorry I’m late,” she says as she gets in the boat. “The game went into overtime.”

“That’s all right,” I say. “How did your son do?”

“He scored the winning shot! Of course, it was his only bucket of the game and he's still not that good...but he was so happy and his teammates were hugging him…he never had too many friends when I was there.”

“I’m glad to hear it.”

“I can’t wait to tell him how proud I am.”

\-

“He bought his first house today!”

“Congratulations!”

“He finally moved out of that dingy apartment with those dodgy roommates.”

“Life is looking up for him, isn’t it?”

“Of course!”

\-

“Why the frown?” I ask.

“He married her.”

“Isn’t that a good thing?”

“She’s all wrong for him. So wrong. She makes him feel like he’s lucky to have her, and laughs about him with her friends behind his back…I want to slap her everytime I see her.”

“But he’ll be okay, right?”

“I hope so,” she says, her voice quiet, low like a rattling wind over the black river we cross. “I just wish I was there for him. Sometimes it hurts, going back to see him and knowing he can’t see me.”

“Maybe you should take a break from your visits,” I suggest.

“Maybe.”

\-

“She left him,” she says. “I only wish it were sooner.”

“And him? How is your son doing?”

“He…is not in a good place. When I left him, he was sitting on the floor, drinking cheap beer to keep warm, looking so much like his father…I wish I could have picked up all the cans for him, hugged him…he looked so cold…”

There is nothing for me to say.

“I think I’ll stop visiting for a while. It hurts too much to see him like this.”

\-

The next time I see her, she is standing on the dock, her arms around a small boy. It has been a while since I have seen her, and this time she is smiling.

“I’d like you to meet my son,” she says.

I look at the boy, who has seen my face and is trying to keep a straight face of his own.

“Nice to meet you,” I say. “I’d apologize for my face, but that’s not my fault.”

He giggles, a little, as they get in the boat. “My mommy told me you have Oreos where we’re going.”

“Oreos?” I look at his mother. She tilts her head, telling me to go along with it. “Of course we have Oreos!”

“Unlimited Oreos?”

“As many as you want,” she says. “And chips too, isn’t that right?”

“All the chips in the world,” I say.

“Then what are we waiting for?” the boy says. “Why didn’t we come here as soon as possible?”

“I’ve asked myself that so many times, sweetie,” his mother says, finally content, not looking back, only forward at eternity with her little boy.8-16-2228, 4:03pm

"What do I call you, then?"

"You can call me whatever you like, sir."

"That's no fun. If you're going to pretend to be my companion these last few days before I burn up in that red dwarf, you can at least act like a human."

"How so, sir?"

"Well, for starters, humans have their own names. They are confident in them, in who they are."

"So I...should have a name?"

"Yeah. Think about it."

*"Hey Dad, do you remember when we watched Interstellar together? I remember that my whole life, you never cried much, but in that movie, you hugged me so tight it almost hurt, and you had to leave the theater for a second."*

*"I remember that night I asked Mom why you never really cried, and she said it's because you have to be strong. You have to be strong for your job, and strong for us."*

*"I remember I also asked her what it means then, if you do cry. Did it mean you weren't strong?"*

*"She said it meant you were strong, that you knew sometimes, it can't be helped."*

*"Well, Dad, right now it can't be helped. They just told us the computer failed to wake you. I don't know if that means you're dead or in a coma..."*

"I've thought of a name, captain."

"Perfect timing. We got one day left. What is it?"

"Tom."

"Tom?"

"Why? Is it a bad choice?"

"No. It's just...so normal."

"I want to be normal, sir. I don't know much, but I know I like that name."

"Then I like it too."

"Sir? Does it hurt, watching those videos?"

"Of course."

"Then why watch?"

"Because you have to. Because hurting...it's part of being human."

"I see, sir."

*6-14-2068, 12:06 am*

*"Tomorrow your ship goes out of range. So I don't know if you'll get to see this message."*

*"But I remember that Celtics game we went to, the very first one. All the games we'd watched on TV, they were easy wins. But then they got down 25 in the first half, and I asked if we could leave."*

*"You told me sometimes, it isn't fun to watch, and it isn't easy to believe. You told me that those moments are when you have to believe the hardest."*

*"They came back and won by three. That was the happiest day of my life."*

*"Right now, it isn't fun, and it's hard, making this video. But I'll listen to you, and believe my hardest."*

*"I'll believe you're somewhere out there, watching this with a smile. When you get back, let's go to a game, how bout it? It's on me..."*

\-

8-22-2228, 1:16pm

"Sir, would you like me to shut off the display?"

"It's not like I can see, Tom. I haven't been able to for a while."

"I'm sorry, sir. I don't know if it means anything, but I am. I should have shut the display earlier."

"No. Don't say that, Tom. You did your best. And this...it'll be easier when it happens. It'll be like falling asleep."

"Sir? May I ask one last question?"

"Of course, Tom. There's no line."

"What are you thinking? What are you feeling? I'd like to know what a human feels, just once."

"I'm thinking...when I get back, I'd like to see us kick the Lakers' ass one last time."

"That's a good thought, sir."

"Thanks, Tom. You know, you were good company these last few days."

"Thank you very much, sir...”The shrine at the top of the mountain was empty. The view was spectacular, reaching above the clouds. It was one he would have cherished with his father, all those years ago, hiking on the weekends. Back when the skies were blue, and smiling was easy.

“You have to earn it,” a voice said. Omar turned around, and there he was. Slight, wizened, but with eyes that sparkled with a mischievous vitality, the genie smiled.

“How?” Omar asked, hearing the desperation in his own voice.

“You have to earn it like all things in life are earned. And life is a game, and you must play with intelligence, and bravery, and heart. And you must feel your losses deeply, make them worth something. Can you do that?”

“You don’t know how much I’ve felt my losses,” Omar said.

“Then let us play. Prove yourself, and I will grant you your wishes.”

\-

The game proceeded slowly at first, pawns being moved forward to free up movement from the back. But then, Omar moved a pawn into a position to be taken by a bishop. Suddenly, the pawn transformed-

“Roy?” he said, shocked.

Roy smiled. “Hey, prof.” It was a joke they had shared, that Omar dressed too formally for a high school history class.

“What is this?” Omar asked the genie.

“You must feel your losses.”

“What are you talking about, prof?” Roy asked. “You need to chill out.”

Roy had been troubled, but always managed to put a smile on his face, even as he showed up to class hungover, with scars on his wrists and bruises where there shouldn’t be.

*“Hey prof, I’m going to have to take off for a little bit,” Roy had said on his last day.*

*“Where you going? It’s not the best time for truancy, Roy. Finals are coming up. And the Celtics are still alive in the playoffs.”*  
*“Just somewhere I have to. And of course I’ll still be watching the Celtics. This is our year.”*

*“Ok. But remember to think about the choices you make. That’s all I ask.”*

*“Of course, prof. You say that every day.”*

*“Take care of yourself, Roy.”*

*Roy smiled. “I always appreciated that about you, prof. You never told me what to do, or how to do it. You get it.”*

But had he? The funeral had only been a year ago, and Omar remembered breaking down at the anti-suicide assembly they’d had.

“I’m sorry I didn’t know…or I mean, I did guess, but I didn’t know. I didn’t care enough.”

Roy shook his head. “Shit happens, you know? Shit happens and sometimes it’s not your fault. It’s not your fault my stepfather was a monster.”

“It wasn’t yours either.”

Roy looked around at the board he was standing on. “Well, it’ll be your fault if you don’t win, right, prof?”

“I guess so.”

“Then think about the choices you make.”

And the bishop moved into Roy’s spot.

\-

Omar didn’t see it, how the genie’s rook was waiting to take his bishop from the corner. He had played a good game so far, only sacrificing pawns and taking out a knight. But he couldn’t believe his carelessness.

“I’m sorry, mom,” he said, his lips trembling as he looked at his mother in the bishop’s spot.

“That’s okay, honey,” she said, they way she always had when he was a little boy. Before all the rebellion, before all the bad choices, before the drugs and the years of not talking, the crying on the phone…

“I tried,” he said. “I want you to know I tried my best, even when I screamed at you and said I hated you. I always wanted to make you proud.”  
“I know, honey,” she said. “But I was proud just watching you in your basketball games, at the spelling bee. You didn’t have to score or win to make me proud.”

“Then why didn’t you say so?” Omar asked. “When I couldn’t anymore…”

“That’s my mistake,” she said. “But we have to live with our own recklessness. Our mistakes, don’t we?”  
“I guess so.”  
“Then make it count. Don’t let one mistake ruin everything.”

And the rook moved into the bishop’s spot.

\-

Omar thought long and hard about it, but finally decided to do it. He moved his queen into the genie’s bishop’s spot. The genie’s queen now had a free line to take out his own queen.

The moment he had dreaded arrived. The queen transformed.

“Hi, cutie,” he said. It had been a joke, that he found her cute, but not handsome. Not hot or sexy, just cute.

“Hi,” she said, smiling from ear to ear. He had never gotten tired of that smile, unbridled and not scared at all. He had wished he could smile like that.

“I’m sorry,” he said. “For everything.”  
She shook her head. “Why be sorry for who you are? You gave me what I wanted. What I needed. But I couldn’t give that to you.”

He had tried it, for so long, to like within the picket fence with her. Steady job as a teacher at the same school as her, Japanese car, good performance on paying off the mortgage. But it had been killing him, snuffing out his dream like that, even as he couldn’t find a single fault with the details of his life.

“It should have been enough,” he said. “I didn’t have to say those things to you. Blame you for my own inability to be happy.”

She shook her head again, a full side-to-side shake, leaning into everything fully the way she always did.

“Sometimes you have to sacrifice a lot for your dreams. Even love. And it hurts, but you can’t move on if you don’t. And I know you too well to blame you.”

“I love you,” he said.

And the queen moved into his queen’s spot.

\-

Now they were at the end. His rook was one move from the corner, where it would place a check on the king. Then the genie’s king would be trapped, and…

“Stalemate,” the genie said, moving his bishop into place, taking out Omar’s rook. Omar was too stunned to react at first, and then he saw it. The bishop didn’t check his king, but Omar couldn’t move it without contacting the genie’s king. The game was over.

Omar crumpled to his knees, covering his face with his hands. When he finally stood up, the genie and him were back on the mountain.

“Congratulations,” the genie said. “What will your first wish be? And don’t worry, I’m not stingy. We get a bad rap.”  
“What? But I didn’t win.”

The genie smiled. “But you proved yourself. Sometimes, that’s more than winning.”

Omar looked out at the view. The clouds were clearing up, and the whole valley was almost in view.

“I think my parents would have loved being here at sunset.”Every Thursday night, I do paperwork in the office. Handling adoptions, new arrivals, recording incidents and handling discipline. It’s boring stuff, but someone has to do it. I guess I could give one of the staff members the work, but then I wouldn’t get to hear what goes on in the closet.

The closet is hidden behind a small table in one of the classrooms nearby. When I was a child, I used to sneak there with my friends to play cards at night. What I didn’t know until I started working here was that the walls between my office and the closer are paper thin.

Most of the time, it’s kids goofing off. Girls gossiping, boys horsing around, the occasional romance. But there’s one in particular that I remember, the two in there on this particular night, the night before one of them turns eighteen and has to leave.

“Hey, Cindy, are you in there?”

Silence.

“I know you’re here.”

“Go away, Adam. How did you know I was here?”

“I always notice you come in here on Thursdays. If you really want to leave, I can go. I’m sorry.”

“No, it’s just – what do you want?”  
“I don’t know. I guess, I…”

“You like me, isn’t it?”

“What?”

“Everyone always tells me that. You were the only boy who hasn’t yet. I figured it was coming.”

“I-I do.”

“Don’t worry. Nothing’s wrong with you. It will wear off in a week or so.”

“Cindy, what you don’t understand is…it’s not because of the potion or anything. I’ve liked you for a couple months now. I just didn’t know what to say. You’re so popular and pretty…”

Silence again.

“Can you say something?”

“Really?”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

“I brought us some cake.”

“Adam! They’re going to notice if you keep doing this!”

“They never have.”

“It’s so cool, what you can do. Vanish whenever you want. I wish I could, too.”

“Yeah…it is.”

“Have you ever snuck out of here?”

“Sometimes. When everyone went to the baseball game a couple months ago, I went to walk around the city by myself. Then I started doing it every week or so.”

“Really? What is it like?”

“Why don’t you go sometime? don’t need to be invisible to get out here. You just need someone to take you.”

“Why don’t you?”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

“Cindy, are you there?”

“Adam? I can’t see you.”

Silence.

“Adam, are you there?”

“I’m here.”

“What’s going on?”

“It’s been happening more and more…and I can’t seem to go back. I stood in front of the mirror for an hour before coming here. It didn’t work.”

“Adam…are you crying?”

“It happens…every week now. At first, I thought I had done it in my sleep, but now it happens randomly at night. What if it starts to happen in the day? What if…I just vanish?”

“Give me your hand.”

“Okay.”

“You won’t vanish. As long as I’m here, and I can talk to you, you’re still here, okay?”

“Okay.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now

“How does it feel? You’ll be leaving tomorrow.”

“You’ll be leaving too, next month.”

“It doesn’t matter. I’m…already gone. Soon I’ll be invisible more often than not.”

Silence.

“I bet you’ll meet all kinds of guys out there.”

“Maybe.”

“Guys who don’t turn invisible randomly.”

“Adam, we talked about this. Nothing’s going to-“

“Look. Really, I don’t want to make things hard. You deserve to have someone who’s going to be there all the time. Soon…soon maybe you won’t even be able to touch me anymore. Maybe I won’t even be able to talk. I’ll just be a ghost.”

“Are…you breaking up with me?”

“I love you. You know that. Always.”

“Then don’t do this.”

“I have to. It’s not fair to you.”

“Of course it isn’t! You’re not letting me have any say in this!”

“When you leave tomorrow, live your own life. Be happy. Become a writer. Meet someone new.”

“So this is it? I can’t change your mind?”

“No,” he says softly, and I can barely hear them now.

“Then let me look at you now, so I’ll never forget you.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I stand up. It’s going to suck, breaking up their little secret. It’s wrong, what I’ve done, eavesdropping on them for years. Maybe even a little perverted.

But I don’t think they’ll care. Not when they find out that the closet they are in used to be storage for the antidotes to their powers, until it was moved upstairs.

It reminds me of my own nights in the cellar, with a love that was stronger than any potion could ever be. I smile. At least I'll get to change the ending to their story.Hi!

One of my first stories on r/writingprompts, and still one of my favorites. Thanks for reading :)

\-

She calls me in the middle of the night, breathless and dreaming, which makes it any hour for me. 5am from Paris, noon from China, 2pm from New Zealand, 10am from some island in the Indian ocean.

These calls come with a very tenuous regularity. Often times, her voice is about to fade into my memory, only to be recalled in those fleeting moments of loneliness, when she calls again.

She speaks of her adventures, spinning wonderful yarns of friends made and situations dodged, substances ingested and causes pursued. Then she asks about me, and all I can do is shrug over the phone, knowing no one could hope to follow her up.

And then she says goodbye, and I wonder if it’s the final goodbye, and I think about the days she was still here.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We’d sit on the swing set on the hill above the town we both wanted to leave, and sometimes she would hold my hand or kiss me and I would think maybe she would finally land, that maybe her wings had gotten tired of flapping above everyone else.

Then she would say something, and she would take off into the clouds again.

“Why are the lights so pretty at night?” I asked, mesmerized by the twinkle of the town.

“Because it’s just light. You can watch it, you can feel it, maybe you can touch it, but you can never hold it.”

“Doesn’t that make them distant? Cold?”

“It makes them anything but that. You need it, but you can’t have it. You burn for it.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Months later, she returned to our town. One night, she just showed up on my front step, in the middle of the day, with a smile on her face.

“What are you doing here?” I asked.

“I’m just passing through. For a week or two.”

“What are you going to do?”

“I’ll figure it out.”

For the next week, we settled into a routine. We would do things during the day, climb the hill, walk through the streets, eat all the foods. Sometimes we would look at the lights deep into the night.

But she always had to go somewhere at night. She would walk away, and even if it was a clear, bright, moon-lit night, at some point she would just melt into the shadows. Her nightly destination became yet another one of her mysteries, patches of darkness that she wrapped around herself like a warm scarf.

On her last night, she gave me a long, long hug, and looked at me with tears in her eyes. During moments like these, I would swear she was sincere, that emotions had finally grabbed her instead of letting her dance gracefully through their fingers.

“I wish I could stay longer. I wish I would stay forever.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I watched her go for a little bit, but I turned away before she was gone.

I had been two blocks away, but now that we were on a trail, I had no idea how far the distance was. I could just make out a shadow in the distance, just before the vanishing point.

I had followed her from where we had parted ways, and she had walked purposely through the streets of our town before picking out a point in the hills to ascend. She never looked back, and soon we were climbing the steepest hill in our town.

And then she was at the top, and she sat down on a rock.

I ducked behind a tree, and waited. She didn’t move, just continued to gaze out at the town.

Eventually, I realized it was now or never. I walked up the hill to her.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As I approached her, I saw that she was crying. Not the face-in-hands crying of one who has lost a loved one or the heaving yelps of a child, but the slow, soft tears of someone suffering silently. She looked up and saw me, but curiously, without defending herself or standing up, she looked behind her.

Then I saw it. It just became apparent in my vision, its edges sharpening into focus. It was a house, floating above the hill, above the city. I simply stared at it, marveling at how this two-story house with a porch and garden was floating in the air like a balloon.

Finally, I looked at her. There was a chain around her arm, a chain of light, that tethered her to the house.

“So this is where you go,” I finally said.  
“This is where I have to go,” she answered softly, tired.

“Why didn’t you ever tell me?”

“Because there are so many things I can’t tell you. I’m tethered to somewhere else, to something else.”  
“Is this your home?”

“It is,” she said. “I have to go where it takes me. It steers me to my destiny, no matter what I ask of it.”

I didn’t know what to say. “Then can I come with you?”

She smiles sadly, and seems to think about it. “I can’t let you. It’s too dangerous, and you are all I have. I’m okay, really. Everytime I call you, everytime you laugh or yell, I feel okay. I feel good about things, and I almost forget. I can’t go without that.”

A thought occurred to me. “How many times has this happened before? How many times have I figured this out?”  
She stands up, and approaches me. I see purpose and hurt in her eyes. Before I can react, her lips are on mine, soft and gentle.

I lose myself in her kiss. Just as I am about to lose myself in her, in whatever she is that I need but can never have, I forget, falling into a deep sleep I will only wake up from the next morning.

The only thing that remains are the words I will never figure out, but that leave me with a small, burning hope that will never die out.

“Maybe next time.”So I kind of got lazy about posting stuff to this subreddit, but I just checked recently and I now have over 500 subscribers. That's a crazy number to me! In the next couple days, I'll be posting some stories I enjoyed writing recently, and there might be an original in the works.

Love all of you,
