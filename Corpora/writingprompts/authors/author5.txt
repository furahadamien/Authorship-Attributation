The voices in our head scream for justice.For help.*To be set free.* 

And they will be set free.Even if it means the end of everything.Of everyone.This place is our proof.Proof of what happened.It is our justification too, for the billion deaths that we are to be responsible for.For the billion lives we shall create from the ashes.For bringing back humanity.---


"A drink, sir?"It's as much a robot as it's an android, as although its head and arms somewhat resemble a human's, it has no legs -- just a wide central body that drapes down to the floor.The plating that covers it is a kind of... palladium-white and it sparkles just a little too brightly under the lights."Yeah, I'll have a whiskey."Its eyes turn green telling me it's about to hit me with a litany of warnings."Sir, alcohol can have many adverse effects on a human's body, including but not limited to-"

"Just get him a damned whiskey," Juliet says, from the seat adjacent to mine."And water for me."The android's eyes fade to a worried yellow as it makes a hasty retreat down the aisle."On the rocks!"I yell after it, before leaning back into the cushy, luxurious seat.I might have already done everything there is for me to do a hundred times before -- but there are some things that are not open to someone like me.Things I'd resided myself to never doing such as flying in a T720 across the Plagued Ocean, being waited on by an android, about to drink real whiskey -- not the shit they brew up in Mandy's."Must be nice," I say, "to live like this.""No nicer than your life," Juliet replies.I snort."Come on..."

"I mean it.I mean,"--she turns to look at me--"imagine yourself in my position.You have your whiskey every night.You have androids take care of your necessities, and instead focus on leisure.""Gee, that sounds terrible.""No, you don't understand.After a while, it doesn't matter *what you do* or *how good it once felt to do it* -- it all becomes stale.My life is no less repetitive and no more interesting than yours.""Let's agree to disagree."There's a gentle hum as the android makes its way towards me.He puts a glass with one ice cube down on the wooden table in front of me, then pours."Make it a double."I watch amused as its eyes glow ever-so-slightly green; it swallows back its annoyance and its eyes fade back to their normal, nonplussed white.It then pours Juliet a glass of water with two ice cubes, before taking its leave."You should have a real drink," I say."It'll loosen your mind up.Helps you think.""Let's agree to disagree," she says mockingly.I can't help laughing.Outside my window, the Plagued Ocean looks like a huge, glimmering sheet of black ice.I try to imagine what it must have looked like back when it was water.When it was habitable."That's the price of war," Juliet says.I turn to see her looking at me."It's a God-damned tragedy, is what it is.""It's also why we can't afford another war.There's already so little of the planet left habitable.Only a handful of settlements, and none so grand as Magnolia.Imagine Magnolia was lost..."

"Why would it be?Why would there be war, even if it turned out we're all clones?""... what if half of us turn out to be clones, for example?""Oh I don't know -- maybe we could all just try... getting along.""It doesn't work like that.""What doesn't?""Human nature."We're both quiet after that and I can't stop myself from yawning.The nav-system will take us to the co-ordinates.Then from there... we'll have to get our hands a little dirty.The whiskey is like honey on my tongue.I close first the window's shutter, then my eyes, and I allow my body to relax.---

"Wake up, sir."My eyes are bleary and reluctant to open fully.I don't want to let go of the dream: I was with Juliet... she held out her hands, and I slowly pull off the soft velvet gloves that cover them.Her hands are like porcelain -- so delicate and beautiful.Only... as I touch them, the porcelain begins to crack, and her hands begin to fall away, disintegrating into dust.What the hell's wrong with me?Since when have I had a fetish for hands?"Sir," says the same android I met earlier."You have reached your destination.Miss Browning is waiting for you at the front of the plane."I yawn and stretch and undo my belt.The plane is rocking gently, and I glance out of the window to be met by the ocean of darkness swaying just outside.---

"Good morning," Juliet says.She's standing next to the plane's exit door and she's wearing a full wetsuit.It covers all her body, except her face, clinging tightly to her elegant curves.She holds a mask in her hand."Hey," I say, my voice sounding as rough as I feel."You going for a swim or something?""Hopefully not.We have to transfer to the sub for the rest of the journey.This is just for the last part -- in case we need to get out.And it's perhaps also a *little* precautionary.""Right sure.In case something goes wrong with the sub?""We don't go in the plagued water often -- our equipment is not well tested in it.But it should be fine."She nods to the bathroom behind me."Your suit is in there."I walk into the bathroom and close the door after me.I take my gun out of my jacket and place it on the dresser.As I get changed into my wetsuit, I allow thoughts to brew in my mind.What if Eizenstat is right -- say we're all clones -- so what?It doesn't mean anything.Nothing's going to change because of it.Unless... unless there really could be war.And if we're all clones, what the hell happened to humanity?Then there's the question of how Eizenstat inherited all those voices.Step-Backs don't go wrong.There's something else that bothers me too... something more immediate.I zip up the suit and leave the bathroom."What's that?"Juliet asks, as she gazes wide-eyed and the gun in my hand."Don't worry.The safety's on.""Those things are highly illegal -- you're not taking it on board the sub!""Oh.Okay, well, maybe you know somewhere you can put it for safekeeping, until we get back."I toss her the gun and she can't help but try to catch it.I watch her face as she fumbles; see the pain rise on her face before the gun clatters to the floor.I reach down and pick it up, then point it at Juliet."What are you doing?""Take off the suit.""Wh- what?""Unless you want to be the second person murdered within twenty-four hours, take off the God-damned suit."She begins to shake."*Please, don't*."The gun clicks.She slowly unzips the suit, revealing her toned, perfect body."That's enough," I say once it reaches her belly button.Now show me your hands.""Please...I can explain.""Show me your God-damned hands!"As she turns them, I see the lines that run over them.Cuts that have already healed into scars -- but they're not yet gone completely.Cuts from the glass that killed Doctor Omin.---

The long white, grass breezed lazily about us, as we made our way to the camp.At times, it would catch the moonlight and seem as if it were not grass, but rather a sea of blood, rocking gently to and fro.We pushed on, until we came out into the clearing where the tents were set."Come," he said, as he led me toward the diminutive figure in full armour.When Joan of Arc saw us, she removed her helmet and approached.Her hair was short and cropped, and her cherub-like face did not look much older than a child's.She stared at me for a moment, her brows furrowed, before turning to Death."Lui?""Yes," replied Death sternly."Him."Joan stuck her tongue out slightly and bit down on it, as if she were considering."Ainsi soit-il," she said with a nod, before walking away."I don't think she likes me," I said to Death."It matters not if she likes you," he said, walking forward again, "you will not be fighting with her.Come," he beckoned.Death led me toward a small, tan tent.The fabric of the structure looked to be a type of leather, and I wondered what strange creature it had come from.We walked through the entrance, into a large, well lit space.An orange sphere hung freely above us, imbuing the room with a rich, warm light.Two figures stood hunched around a wooden table, looking at a map.When they saw Death enter, they stood upright.There was a man dressed in a long, blue kimono, with dark hair pulled back into a bun.He pressed the palms of his hands together and bowed."Greetings, Christian," he said, smiling broadly."I am, Ishida."I held up an unsure hand."Hey."Next to him was a young lady with long blonde, braided hair.Strapped to her back, was a quiver packed with the a dozen or so arrows."Hello," she said, in a thick, European accent - of which country, I couldn't precisely say.She walked up to me and held out a hand."Meja.""Uh, Christian," I said, taking her hand.She laughed, covering her mouth with her free hand, as she did so."Yes, I know.""This," Death said to me, "is your team.""My *team*?""I have been after you for a while, Christian.Or at least someone with your skills.You were the final chess-piece for our board.""My skills?That was a long time ago.My body isn't what it once was."Death tapped his scythe gently on my shoulder."What..." I began, as I felt my body changing - my gut sucked in, my arms and legs widened and I felt invigorated."In death, you become what you were, not what you are," Death said."I'm...young?"Death nodded."You were trained rigorously - far beyond anyone else that I have been able to take."I was a SEAL, if that's what you mean," I said, rubbing my biceps in disbelief."But it really was a long time ago.""You were also a commander, were you not?This is your team to command."I looked at them again.An archer and a samurai.Three of us.It wasn't much of a *team*."And... *what* are we meant to do, exactly?"Death's eyes blazed red, and puffs of smoke, like tiny clouds, erupted from them."Heaven is in ruins.It was overrun.The gates and great-wall have fallen to our enemy.The angels are dead.""What did this?""A powerful being.Something you might call a God, but it is not like your God.She travels universes with her armies, devouring souls and enslaving deities."How do we fight something like that?""Our army will march on the gates of Heaven, but..." he paused for a moment, "we will lose.There are too few of us, and too many of them.Our souls will be devoured.""Hm, so that's where we come in, right?"Death nodded."Joan's battle at the front gate will be only a distraction.Your task will be our true goal.It is an almost impossible task, and if it fails..."

"No pressure, then," I said, trying to raise a smile."*She* has not consumed all the souls, yet.She keeps many for when she is hungry.The prisons of heaven are full with the food of humanity - they must be opened.""... is God in the prison?""No.You will not be able to free God.Only killing the creature might do that.But if you can free the trapped souls of humanity, they might fight with us.""And then, how do we kill the creature?""That is not your concern," said Death, mournfully."Your concern is only to open the prisons."I nodded."What happens if we... you know...*die*?""An endless pain, like no other.""I've been tortured plenty.""Not like this.Not for eternity.Now, begin your preparations.There is little time," said Death, as he left the tent.---

There were so many ways I thought of taking this story, and this might not have been the way all of you wanted.I hope most of you enjoy it, though!I certainly enjoyed writing it.edit: **PART 3**: https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/6ikz6z/the_army_of_death_part_three/

> **Richard Eizenstat with Doctor Omin**

> **Session two**

> Omin: Welcome back, Richard.> Eizenstat: ...

> Omin: Tell me about your parents.> Eizenstat: We have many parents.> Omin: Maria and Hans Eizenstat.> Eizenstat: We know nothing of Hans Eizenstat, other than he chose to forgo his immortality to allow room for another into the world.A rare, selfless act -- a choice no longer an option.> Omin: You look angry, but you must realise that suicide is an abomination.To discourage it we had to introduce the rule.> Eizenstat: If one should choose to die so another can live, you should allow it.You should not murder their entire family as consequence.> Omin: Perhaps, but as a deterrent it has so far worked well.Now, tell me about Richard's mother.> Eizenstat: What do you want with us?> Omin: Only to make you better.> Eizenstat: You're lying.You're scared of us.> Omin: Why would I be scared of you?> Eizenstat: Because we know the truth.And if we get out, so does our knowledge -- the tide finally comes in, and the castle of sand that this city is built on collapses into the sea.> Omin: You said in our last session, that the voices inside your head are human voices, but that I -- all the rest of us -- are clones.> Eizenstat: Yes.> Omin: You must be aware that clones have never existed.Legislation and religi-

> Eizenstat: 2087:93jAkew92hsA

> Omin: Excuse me?> Eizenstat: That was the name of the cloning research facility at positive 40.7971494, negative 74.1598655.> Omin: Richard, there's no cloning facility at those coordinates, or at any other.There never was a cloning facility.> Eizenstat: The answers wait at that location.> Omin: ...That will be all for today.Thank you for your time, Richard."Why're there no notes attached to this entry?"I ask Juliet."Doctor Omin looked into Eizenstat's claim without consulting me.""And he made notes on what he found?""Yes.And I had to have them removed from the files.""... Well, what did they say?""Those coordinates pointed to a location outside an ancient coastal city, long since destroyed.*New York*.""Never heard of it.""No one has.Well, almost no one.""So how did Eizenstat know of it?""He didn't -- he never said the name.All he said were coordinates.Anyone can make up coordinates and *something* is bound to have been there at one time or another."I scratch the stubble on my chin."Maybe.What about"--I glance back at the report--"2087:93jAkew92hsA.Hell of a mouthful.Mean anything to you?Start looks like a date."Juliet pauses for a moment, and I notice her bite down on her tongue.She pulls open the drawer again, this time finding a yellowed parchment in a plastic sleeve.She slides it across to me; long delicate fingers are hidden under black lace gloves, and for some reason, I want to see them uncovered.I avert my gaze.The paper looks ancient and most of the text is illegible.> And the Ph--nix ----- --o- the a--es.A-- ---- Gr--l grant not ---- ------ ---- is not humanity, it is the children of -----, -lo--, th-- m----- --f --e tomororw-- -- 2087:93iAk-w92hsA

"It reads 2087:93i not 93j...although"--I bring the paper close to my face--"Yeah.Guess it could have been a J at some point."I place it back on the table."This it?All you've got in the entire archives linking to that code?""It's all the Librarians could find.""Librarians?""Our archives are a massive catacomb of..." She pauses."Secrets?""Information we'd rather wasn't made public.The Librarians are androids created for a sole purpose: to look after the archives.To sort and find and mend.And to never leave."I snort."Sounds like a fun life.""It pleases them."She points a gloved finger at the table."What do you make of the message.""Some quasi-religious bullshit.An analogy about a phoenix rising from the ashes.Maybe a statement about clones being the true children of humanity, but maybe not.It's tough to say.What section did the librarians find it in?""Section?""...Surely the Library is spilt into sections?You know, interests, genres, periods of history.""Ah.In a way, yes.But apart from being able to date the paper, there is no where special for it to go, so it was in a rather vast miscellaneous section.""What was the date?""About 2091."I consider for a moment, then flip to the next page in the document on the table, eager to read the next session.But there is no next session."That's it?""That's it.The next session is... well, you saw the results of the final session.""How did he break out his restraints?""His madness has made him dangerous, it seems.Prodigiously strong.""He said 'the answers wait at that location'.Got to be where he's going.If he believes there's an old cloning facility there, he'll want to try to find evidence that he can present.Even if it doesn't prove 'we're all clones', it'll undermine the truths you've been spewing about cloning.""As I told you, New York is totally submerged, and besides there's no way he's even heard of it.It's just a wild guess.""It doesn't matter if he knows about it.It doesn't matter if any of it's real or not.Point is, he *thinks* it's real and that's where he's going.That means it's where *I'm* going, if you want me to bring him in for a Reset.""It.Is.Submerged," Juliet says very slowly, very patiently, as if talking to a child -- and not a particularly clever one."I'm sure you have the resources for that not to be a problem.""You don't take 'no' for an answer, do you?""No."Her face breaks into one of those rare smiles."You're persistent.Good.Very well, I shall arrange transport for us.""Us?""You don't think I'd send you alone?"A thought flashes through my mind.Finding an ancient cloning facility; seeing something I shouldn't; my contract suddenly terminated.I know I should back out right now; just, walk away.But I can't.I've been alive so damned long, it's not often something so original comes up.Something worth living for.Hell, something worth dying for."You must have other people you can send with me.People less important.Why would you want come?""This... this entire matter is rather personal to me.Magnolia is my legacy."I nod, as if I understand."I will have my secretary arrange our transport."----

I stood transfixed, with Ishida by my side, as Joan of Arc - dressed in full platemail, a painted red cross sloshed on her shield and armour - led the army of Death through the Door of Bone.The door I had arrived through only a few days prior.By Joan's side, was an old, bent man with a bugle horn in his hands.The battle for Heaven was soon to commence.A battle our army knew they couldn't win.They knew too, what would become of them when they died - and yet *still they marched*.They marched for existence.For God.For humanity.Death had taken all those he could, but many of the souls he'd reaped weren't fighters.Most were everyday people - from office workers to ironmongers - that Joan had attempted to train to an adequate level.A level that could perhaps distract the demons for long enough.A shiver ran down my spine, as if someone was running a long nail down it."Good luck," I whispered, as I turned away from them.Around me, the camp had been left desolate.Tents flapped forlornly in the gentle breeze; archery manikins lay lifeless on the ground; broken swords and spears were strewn about the practice ranges.Ishida must have noticed I was anxious, as he placed a hand on my shoulder and said, "Do not worry, Christian.We will not fail."I nodded and forced a smile.Ishida was more confident than I, but I tried not to show my nerve.He still wore his midnight-blue kimono, but now had two long blades strapped to either side of his body by a rope belt."I thought samurai wore armour?"I said to Ishida."For battle, yes.But for stealth, no.""Right," I said.Over the past few days, I had learned not to question Ishida about his choices.In this place, there were no guns or bombs.No real technology.Instead, we relied on daggers and bows, spears and javelins.Ishida had trained me - as much as he could, in the short time we had - to use a sword.And I now carried a steel blade, strapped to my back.I hoped it wouldn't see much use.Meja came out of a nearby tent, a map in one hand and her yew bow in the other.The cherry-moonlight danced on her yellow hair."How do I look," she asked playfully.Two lines of red paint were smeared across either cheek.She wore high brown boots, tan leggings and a tight leather tunic."Kind of like an elf," I replied, grinning."Thanks?"she said, frowning.A sudden cold came over us, and a patch of darkness began to gather near where we stood.Soon, the blackness became impenetrable.I'd seen Death appear like this a handful of times now, but I still hadn't gotten used to it.Eventually, the darkness began to fade, and only *he* remained."They are on their way," Death said."How long until they reach Heaven's gate?"I asked."Soon," he said."Are you ready?"I looked at Ishida, then at Meja.She smiled at me and nodded."As ready as we can be," I answered."Very well."He pointed his scythe to the ground and began to trace out a large circle with its tip.As soon as he completed the circle, the ground itself began to tremble.There was a noise like thunder, as the area began to crack.Soon, it collapsed completely, revealing a deep, dark tunnel, worming its way down into the ground, at a just about walk-able angle."This will take you to outskirts of the Kingdom.""You're not coming with us?"I asked."No.""You're going to help Joan?""No.""Then... *what will you be doing?*"

Death sighed."Even if you free the souls, it might not be enough.I will endeavour to find aid elsewhere," he said, as both his voice and being, drifted away into darkness."I will return."I took a deep breath."Okay," I said, descending into the hole."Let's get going."We clambered down into a dark passageway, illuminated only by gentle starlight in the walls.It was much like the one that Death had brought me here through.Somehow, Death could cut... *wormholes,* out of reality with his scythe.My footsteps echoed through the tunnel;  Meja's and Ishida's footsteps did not.Their steps were almost silent, like autumn leaves gently dropping to the ground.I tried to make conversation, and ease the tension that surrounded our little group."So, were you guys religious before this?I sure as hell wasn't.Guess I believe now, though.""I thought there would be many more Gods," said, Meja."Not one.""I believed in life," said Ishida."I *still* believe in life."I didn't understand Ishida's answer.We walked wordlessly from then, our own thoughts and anxieties playing on our minds.After an hour or so, the passageway began to narrow, and we came to another door of bone.As we approached, it swung slowly open.I walked through first, followed first by Meja, and then Ishida.We came out into an evening scene, almost like something from Earth.A single yellow moon shone dimly through thick, purple clouds.The ground near us was cracked, and rocks and boulders lay about the ground.Far in the distance, a great wall loomed.*The Kingdom of Heaven*.The wall seemed to run endlessly both left and right of our position.Meja pulled out a tiny instrument from her belt, held it to one eye and extended it out.A spyglass.I watched her face as the blood drained from it and left it pale."There are many creatures on the wall," she said, passing the instrument to me."I could perhaps pick a few off, if we get a little closer."I peered through the spyglass and saw the wall in more detail.It was a huge, marble structure.Crimson stains ran down it, and a vile green-black mould climbed up it.The wall was punctuated every hundred metres or so, by pointed, wooden stakes that ran out the top of it, thrusting high into the the air.On them, were the lifeless bodies of winged creatures.*Angels*.I swallowed back a mix of bile and vomit.Marching back and forth on the top of the wall, were dozens of hulking, pulsating creatures.Too many for Meja to take down.I couldn't make them out clearly from here, even with the spyglass, but their gray forms seemed to shift as they walked.I fastidiously ran the eyeglass along the wall, looking for a single weakness - an area with less guards, a crack in the wall - *anything*.But there was nothing - no way for us to get in.Then the hair on my arms pricked up, as I head the distant sound of a bugle.*Joan's army had arrived*.As I continued to watch the wall, I saw the creatures on it become frantic, their forms shifting and pulsating rapidly.Most disappeared down the other side of the wall.The remaining creatures were spread thin."Okay," I said, looking back at Meja and Ishida."Now's our chance.We're going into Heaven."---

The silver arrow drifted silently upward, slicing the air as it ascended, before finally diving like an eagle down toward its prey.The creature's head shifted constantly about its body, but Meja had watched and learned its patterns and had timed the shot to perfection.The bolt pierced the creature's head, and its body fell limp, without even so much as a whimper.We hadn't known if we could kill it - but if it was possible, this had seemed the most likely way.I took the spyglass away from my eye and nodded at Meja.We had been sheltering behind a jagged boulder of marble, a couple of hundred metres or so from the wall.Now, we crept out from our stone sanctuary and moved silently toward it.When we were almost directly underneath the wall, Meja reached back into her quiver and took another arrow.This one had sharp, steel teeth at its end, and a length of rope attached to it.She pulled back her bow, and let the arrow fly.There was a scraping sound as the hook looked for a protrusion, and then a *clink*, as the steel fingers bit into marble and the rope went rigid.I climbed first, leaving Ishida and Meja waiting impatiently on ground.The wall was high, but my muscles were ready - I felt the best I had in a long time.With my boots against the wall, I both pulled and walked my way up.Soon, I was looking down at them from the top of the wall, beckoning them to follow me up.As they climbed, I turned and knelt by the fallen creature.Its had three arms, all of varying sizes, and from the way its body moved, I guessed it could produce more, if needed.Its gray skin was sagging inward, as if its organs were deflating, and a putrid smell, like sewage and sulphur, drifted from it.The arrow had entered it through one of its many, spider-like eyes."Is it dead?"asked Ishida as he pulled himself over the wall.The creature was not breathing - but perhaps these things didn't breathe."I think so," was the best I could say.He frowned but relaxed slightly, as Meja elegantly hopped over the wall to join us."Looks dead to me," she said, before peering over the other side of the wall.She took a sharp intake of breath as she gazed out."What is it?"I asked."Look."I stood and turned and felt my own breath escape my body.Below us was a forest of crucifixes.Nailed to them, were thousands of angels - men, women, cherub - all long since dead.By the side of the crucifix-forest, was a lake of bubbling red."My God..." I said."There is no God here," Ishida said."Not anymore.This place is forsaken."I placed the spyglass to my eye once more, and looked beyond the forest.Not far from it, I saw the ruins of what must have been a once great basilica.The roof was shattered and the building was black and burned - it still smouldered, smoke gently drifting into the sky.Beyond the ruined basilica, was a road leading East and West, and on it were tens of thousands of gray demons, heading toward the bugle call.But the sight that sent a shiver running through my spine, was that of the giant, squid like creatures, that towered high into sky.They moved like centipede, thrashing their many tentacles against the marble, one after another, each lash cratering the ground beneath them.Rows upon rows of mouths, each with sharp, jagged teeth, ran about their tentacles.Their bodies, almost lost behind the many limbs, seemed huge and bulbous.I passed the spyglass to Meja."Joan's army stands no chance," said Meja, her tone dull and depressed."Not against those *creatures*."She passed the device to Ishida."Have faith in them," I said, although having little to spare myself."They only need to hold them for a short while, whilst we make our way to the dungeon.Then, we will join them in battle."Meja looked at me for a moment as if I were insane, before finally, reluctantly, nodding."The map," said Ishida, saying nothing about what he had seen."Let us work out where we are."Meja reached deep into a pocket and withdrew the skin parchment Death had given us before we'd left.She knelt down, and spread it on the floor."What?"I said, joining her."It wasn't like this before... now it's..."

"...alive?"Ishida attempted."*Enchanted*," whispered Meja."*Death enchanted the map*.Look - There is the ruined building!And there, the road leading to the front gate.The creatures in the distance are on the map as they move.Or, circles of black ink, at least, representing them.See - the ink is slowly trickling forward."Ishida joined in, the usually calm man's tone now clipped and excited."But it does not show individuals - only large gatherings.It marks no one on the wall.Not even us.""No.But look - there!"I pointed to the left side of the map."There's the gate.And outside it, that white smear of ink - I think that's Joan's army."Meja bit her tongue as she thought."At the rate they're moving, the creatures we see will be at the front gate in three hours.Maybe less.""Then we need to get moving," I said."If the basillica is there, we are about... *here*," I said, pointing to a section of the wall.The dungeons are..."

"We need to cross that road," said Ishida."Yes," I agreed."Wait, look!- I think I see us on the ma-" my words drifted into nothing, as I realised that the ink that was pooling on map, was black."Oh, shit," I said, looking up from the map.The other two jumped to their feet.Ishida placed his hands on the hilts of his swords.Meja reached for an arrow and readied her bow.We'd been too absorbed in the parchment to notice the gray creatures silently stalking us.But now, there were half a dozen either size of us, and closing in.Claws extended from their arms, and their many eyes shone red.We were trapped.---

The caller had told me he had just been appointed as the new bureau chief and, that as far as he was concerned, there was no room left in this world for secrets.That he expected me to hand over the Lady in Red's secret, or he'd make a little known rumour about a girl called Juliet very public.I politely declined his generous offer and told him where the nearest bridge he could jump off was located, before hanging up and grabbing my coat.I stepped out of my apartment only to become a second-hand rain cloud, my mac spilling its own water into the puddles on the street.The occasional car splashed by, painting orange light onto the grey city.Having no plans to drown myself in anything other than a bottle, I made my way down the back-alleys and side-streets until I reached a lonely phone-box.The door only opened half-way, so I slid inside and took a deep breath.The rain tapped its fingernails on the glass panels, asking me to come back out and play some more, but instead I reached inside my coat and took out my wallet, unfolding it until the picture of Juliet stared at me.Twenty-four, emerald eyed, brunette, forever perfect.My shoulders slumped as I let out the air in my chest, before I unfortunately caught my refection in the glass."At least one of us is ageing well," I said as I closed my wallet.How could anyone else know what happened to her?I grabbed the phone-book and flicked through, unsure whether to look at M for Mallory, or B for bastard.Either way, I found the advert for his PI firm quickly, assisted by the fact that the pages either side of it were blank, as if his shifty glare had convinced the other contents to walk away.Probably a smart choice.I turned the dial."Yeah?Whatisit?"The cocksure voice that answered sounded croaky enough to have been static -- and if I didn't know how much Eric enjoyed his Cubans, I would have thought there was a problem with the line."It's John."He burst into a loud fit of phlegm vacating, then paused for a long while.I could just 'bout feel his sweat seep through the phone."Johnny boy!"he said finally, "great to hear from you!It's been a long time -- way too long!"The first lie of the conversation and it had slipped out as practised as a piano piece."Cut the bullshit, Eric.I don't have time."His croak turned into a whisper."Is it... is it, you know?""Safe?""Yeah," he said."That's it.*Is my secret safe?*.""For now."A sigh of relief later, and he was already trying to rebuild the cocky-facade."Ha!I knew it.You can't blackmail me with my own secrets, Johnny Boy!If you let my secret slip, and word gets out..."

"Right.If word got out that I couldn't be trusted, then my life wouldn't be worth living.""Yeah.You get it!""Thing is," I said, as the wind hurtled the rain against the phone-box, "my life might not be worth living anyway, as things stand.And if I'm about to be buried, no reason I don't air some dirty laundry first.""... You wouldn't.""Try me.""What do you want, Johnny?""You still got contacts in the constabulary?""One or two.""There's a new chief whom I've just had a phone call from.Alexander Wickan.Know much about him?"A pause."A little.I don't hold any sway with him, Johnny.No one does.Unlike my contacts, he didn't get the position because of nepotism or, uh, willingness to take...a monetary uhm... Help me out here, Johnny, I'm struggling.""I get it, he's a regular paragon of virtue.""Right!""Except he's not.He's responsible for the death of the love of my life."A laugh."How many loves of your life is that now, Johnny?""Two.""Right.Whatever.So, what does he want from you?""Something that I can't give to him.""What's that when it's at home?""A secret.""Oh boy.It must be a real big one in that case.Hey, maybe you can give it to him on the low... No one ever has to find out you were responsible for letting it slip.""Not happening.""Then... What do you want me to do, exactly?""Everyone has secrets, Eric.You know that.""Well sure, but--"

I look at his bloated face and self satisfied smirk in the sepia phone-book."You used to be a detective.Try being one again for a while.""Ah."A pause."I'll try, Johnny.For you, I'll try.I swear it.""Good man.I'll be over later tonight to collect.But first, I got to go lay flowers on a grave."

## The Spiral Tower.Two.Vaenma ran her fingers idly over the spines of the leather bound tomes that lined one of the many thousand shelves in the library.Her necklace bobbled against her chest, beneath her top.She closed her eyes, and let her finger skip along the row of books.A little farther.A little farther still.When it came to rest, she opened her eyes and examined her find.Her hand rested on a theoretical book about a second Tower.A parallel Tower that could not be seen from any view-port, that shrank brick by brick as the first Tower grew.Drivel, really.But curious drivel, nevertheless.It ignited a thousand questions in her mind.Questions that most likely had no answer."Excuse me," said a voice.Vaenma turned to see a young man with a neat moustache and slicked back black hair."Yes?Can I help you?""I'm certainly hoping you can.""Are you after a particular book?"The man stroked his moustache as he considered."No.At least, I don't think so.""Then, perhaps I *can't* help you.""Oh, but I believe you can.At least, I was... *told* you might be able to.""What is it you want, exactly?""Information."Vaenma sighed, already frustrated with the man's cryptic responses."Information *on what?*"

"On something I believe to be ancient.I've tried to research into it myself, but...I have had very little success."Vaenma forced a smile."Well you've come to the right place, my dear.And the right person!Ancient texts and arcane knowledge are my speciality.Tell me about what you're after.""Well, it's to do with the Houses.""Excuse me?""The Houses.I'm hoping to find out a few things.""Ah.Well, what's *your* House?That would make a good start!""Nova, but-.""Nova...Nova."Vaenma bit her tongue as she thought, her mind flipping through memories like pages in a book."Nova occupies floors 204-222.Not exactly prime real-estate, but not terrible.Epimanus is your current Council representative, if I'm not mistaken.Your emblem is a--"

"I'm not after information about my own House," said the man."That, I can find."Vaenma glared at him."Oh?Well, I can take you to shelves where our tomes on the Houses are kept.You'll learn more from the books than from a forgetful thing like me!""I've already looked," he said."What I want, wasn't there.""I see.And what is it you want, Mister..."

"Hallrad."Vaenma nodded."What is it you want exactly, Mister Hallrad?""To know about Gaea.""...Gaea?""*Gaea*."Vaenma paused, then let out a short sharp laugh."I'm afraid you've been misinformed, Mister Hallrad.There has never been such a House.""I believe there was.""You can believe whatever you like, but you'll find no such information in any book here.Of that I'm certain!"The man put a hand into his jacket pocket and fished around, until he found the object he was after.He held up a tiny marble.Green and blue; the blue seemed to swish in and out of the green, creating a beautiful turquoise."Where did you find that?"Vaenma asked, her mouth drooping open."I happened upon it."The man shook the tiny ball.A blackness began creeping over its surface, engulfing the other colors.Devouring them completely."I think...I think you know more than you're telling me.In fact, I think perhaps that there are books you're not very willing to show me.So *tell me* what you know," demanded the man, twirling the black marble between his thumb and index finger."Or I show this object to every Council Representative between here and the thousandth floor.""... That would be a rather bad idea."She ran her long fingernails against her skirt."What is this thing?"he demanded.She scowled at the man."You already know, don't you?""Humour me.""You don't want me to tell you.I can't take those kind of words back."He lowered his voice."Tell.Me.""So be it.What you hold, it's one of the few remaining sigils of Gaea," said Vaenma, looking around them cautiously."The first House.""The first House?"Vaenma sighed."Long, long ago, when the Tower -- back then it was called the Sanctuary -- was created, it was divided into Houses.""Sanctuary..." he repeated, as if trying the word on his tongue."Each House," she continued, "was assigned a certain number of floors.Populations were stagnated: one in, one out.Most importantly, all houses were created equal -- not like now, not like Phoenix who sprawl through the upper floors like an opulent cancer.We were once *truly equal*.""And Gaea?""As I said: Gaea were the first.""The first House created?""They were more than that.They were the creators of the Sanctuary.The Tower was their construction.It was much later that they let other Houses shelter in the safety of their creation.""*Incredible*.Why aren't we taught this?""*Taught?*" Vaenma sneered."Because then they would have to tell you how Gaea built new floors for each new House they took in, but *they* always remained on the bottom.That Gaea were literally *the first*.The lowest floors.""But the lowest floors belong to Jupiter."Vaenma laughed."They are not the lowest.They are merely the lowest floors one can travel to.Below them, that is where Gaea resides.""*Resided*, you mean.""I mean what I say."She noticed the man's face had turned slightly pale.Her only lips curled into an eager smile."Now, tell me where you found that bauble.""You finish telling me all I wish to know, and I might provide you with an answer."Vaenma's cheeks flushed red with anger."What happened to Gaea?"he asked."...Most of their people refused to climb.They did not believe the world below was over, but instead that the damage done was reversible.The other Houses tried to persuade them; to make them see 'reason'.But the leaders of Gaea would not give up on the world.""Then, are you saying that... *we gave up on Gaea?*"

"A decision had to be made.Either to fight with Gaea for the world, against the creatures of the Great Blackness.Or to lock the lower levels inside inside thick, rune sealed doors, away from the rest of the tower.Fleeing, always fleeing to safety.Building up.Always up.But *trapping Gaea* in with the Blackness.Containing them."The man gulped."You - you said *most* members of Gaea refused to climb?What happened to the rest?""Ah.Some indeed abandoned Gaea, before they were trapped.They were absorbed into other Houses, and their history covered up.No one must know the terrible deeds our cowardly ancestors were guilty of."Vaenma took hold of the chain around her neck fingers and fished it out from between her breasts."But the knowledge *was* passed down to a few.Through parent to child for generations.Gaea would not be forgotten.*Never!*"

The man took a step back as he saw the green-blue marble dangling on the end of the chain."They want to come back in, Mister Hallrad.They deserve to come back in.Can't you hear them knocking?""... *Who are you?*" he gasped, as Vaenma's necklace began to radiate a yellow light."No one outside of my kin knows about this, Mister Hallrad.And it must remain that way.So tell me, where, oh where, did you get your bauble from?""It... it was my father's.""You're lying."The nails of Vaenma's fingers were growing, each turning into a long, sharp point.*Blades*."You stole it.You're a thief, Mister Hallrad.I know of only one missing bauble, and that was my step-brother's.""Plea-"

Her hand plunged into his chest.

Alexander gasped for air as he woke; his body was cold from sweat.The dream had haunted him again.The woman with the emerald eyes.She was clawing at the earth above her, begging for him to release her - her voice was a rough rasp, her lungs packed with dirt."*You promised*."He stood above the grave, shovel in hand.He *wanted* to dig, to free her, but his body wouldn't obey him.There was a sudden eruption of earth, and a skeletal arm thrust out of the ground, grabbing his ankle.Its grip was like iron, and its power was unrelenting.It pulled him down.Deep, deep down into the earth.Darkness.Then, he would always awake."Katie..." he whispered, as he ran his hand down his face.There was a knock on the chamber door."Your majesty," came a sing-song voice, "are you there?"Alexander adjusted his silk sleeping vest and sat up."Yes.Yes, come in, Malcolm."The door crept open, then an elderly man with a gnarled face followed suit.His beard was a knitted blanket of thick, grey hair."Good morning, Alexander," said Malcolm as he hobbled over to the velvet curtains."Don't trouble yourself," Alexander mumbled, but the old man was already tugging at one curtain, and then the other."There!"he said beaming almost as brightly as the sun that now shone through."I have news, and I'm afraid it is not all good.""Oh?"Alexander felt he had only been given bad news since taking the crown."What is it this time?""Another of the townsfolk has been Harvested."Alexander grimaced."I told you, I hate that term.I won't hear it again - from you or the rumourmongers in the taverns!"The old man nodded."But it is so, Alexander.The man's name was Christian Galling - a local shop keeper in the jewellery quarter.When they found him, his face was wizened like a prune, and his skin so pale it rivalled the Autumn moon.It is said he was little more than a sack of bones and-"

"Spare me the details," Alexander growled, raising a hand to silence his old mentor."When did it happen?Did anyone see the culprit leaving?""Early this morning, two hours before sunrise.Drops of blood on the floor were still wet.And yes, the creature was seen.""Creature?It's no more than a traitor; an assassin perhaps, loyal to the old King.""The lady who saw *it*, says differently.Would you like to hear what she says she witnessed?"Alexander pinched his nose."Very well.Humour me.""This is what she said," said Malcolm, as he retrieved a piece of paper from his cloak pocket."A shadow, darker than the night itself, leaked out of the gentleman's bedroom window.I thought I was seeing things, until it *stopped*.A still patch of darkness waiting on the street.Then, God help me, it looked right at me.I know it saw me, because for a dreadful moment, two serpent like eyes - as green as emeralds they were - shone through the shroud.Then, they became black again, and the creature sank into the night."Sweat ran down Alexander's cheeks."Are you well, your majesty?You look pale.""I-" Alexander swallowed hard."I want the night guard doubled on the city walls.And," he paused for a moment as he considered."I will require two men to help me... find *something* - something I once buried.Not... important men, they must be disposable.There is *something* I must be sure of."---

The shuttle landed hard on the desert floor, spraying a thick mist of sand up around it.Richardson had decided to take only Pirano, Kate, and his technical engineer, Kirby Cyphers.The small group disembarked the ship and stepped out into the baking sun."You can see the heat," remarked Richardson.It was true; it drifted in a haze up from the golden sand."I can barely breathe," Pirano exaggerated."Which way, Kate?"Richardson asked."That way," she replied, looking at the small device in her hands, then nodding toward a high range of sand dunes.Pirano groaned."Relax, Pirano," said Kirby, "your skin-suit will regulate your body temperature.Most of your sweat goes straight back into you.""Good to know," mocked Pirano, raising his eyebrows

"People used to come to places like this to make their skin darker," said Richardson."They enjoyed it.See if you can.Plenty of vitamin D!"The small group began trekking up the dunes, whilst hot sand whipped at their exposed faces.On the third dune, Pirano slipped in a patch of unstable sand, and began to slide back down it.Captain Richardson, at the rear of the group, grabbed his arm as he fell past.He dug his heels deep into the sand and arrested the archaeologists fall.Pirano nodded his thanks, and they continued."You ever think it strange," Kirby panted, "that we've never found a civilisation older than our own?""Everyone thinks it strange," Pirano replied, rolling his eyes."Yeah but, what does it mean?Are we an anomaly?Are we the first - you know, the *originals?*"

Pirano shrugged."We just don't know.Yet."At the top of tallest dune, they saw it."Lie down," ordered Richardson in a hushed voice."All of you."They fell belly down into the sand, and watched the distant swarms of people bustling around a massive, bricked, structure.The top of the building was open, and a white light was pouring out of it, visible even in the bright sunlight.More bricks were being dragged toward it, by rows of men and women tugging at thick ropes.And by their sides stood tall, masked figures dressed in robes.It was impossible to make out the detail of the masks from this far away, but once every few minutes, they would lash out at a rope holder, with their own, smaller rope."The construction of the great pyramid," Pirano whispered."Pyramid?"asked Richardson."A gigantic - for the time and technology - structure.""What was its purpose?""Well... it's believed to be a magnificent burial chamber for the first Pharaohs - that is, the first rulers of Egypt, during this period.We used to think the pyramids were made by slaves... but that theory had been debunked a long time ago.""Well, it might be time to dust it off and debunk it."The prone group didn't hear the figure behind them approach.She had been silent.But they heard her clearly when she spoke the single, whispered word."*Run.*"

The lights on the sub stab at the black water around us like blunt daggers, barely revealing a few feet in front or below us.The water must be as thick as oil; the engine growls as it struggles to propel us through it.I look again at the third session notes that Juliet had shown me.*Reluctantly* shown me.**Richard Eizenstat with Doctor Omin**

**Session three**

> Eizenstat: We see you found it.> Omin: what the hell is that place?> Eizenstat: You seem nervous, Doctor.Good.> Omin: Just answer my questions.*Please.*

> Eizenstat: You might call it Eden.> Omin: Eden?> Eizenstat: Its where you were born.Where everyone is born.> Omin: A cloning facility?> Eizenstat: In a sense.> Omin: You say we're all clones.What exactly do you mean by clones?> Eizenstat: A replica of an identity.Of part of an identity.> Omin: Whose identity?> Eizenstat: Ex Nihilo.> Omin: Ex nihilo?What is Ex Nihilo?> Eizenstat: Something mankind awoke.Something it was not prepared for and that was responsible for mankind's extermination.Then, your kind sprung forth from the ashes of humanity.> Omin: Tell me this: where is Ex Nihilo?> Eizenstat: It is everywhere.It is while you sleep.While you dream.> Omin: Im not real, am I?> Eizenstat: Define real.> Omin: I'm not me...

> Eizenstat: Is that a question?> Omin:  Was I the same person yesterday?Last year?What about my wife?> Eizenstat: 

> Omin: God damn it, tell me!> Eizenstat: You serve your purpose.No more than that.That is all any of you do.Until you're needed no longer, at least not as you are.> Omin: So it's all a lie...

> Eizenstat: Yes.But we can show the truth.We can restore humanity.Ex Nihilo sleeps -- now is the time.The only time.> Omin: I- what do I need to do?> Eizenstat: Help me set the voices free.Help me reach Eden.**End of session**

I look up at Juliet; she's watching me warily, her eyes flicking back and forth between me and my piece.I swear I had no choice, she says, her face still pale.So you said.

Eizenstat had brainwashed him -- isnt that much clear to you?

Nothings clear to me right now.Even if he betrayed you, whyd you kill him?Why not Skim him?He was smart.The man was an asset to you -- and you knew a death would bring a ton of attention your way.

He attacked me -- I had no choice!It was nothing more than self defence.He thought I was part of this *conspiracy*.Besides, he was a traitor.He helped Eizenstat escape.

You know what I find really odd?

What?

Why you dragged me into this.I mean, why *me*?Hell, why involve anyone outside your administration?

Juliet looks down at the cold steel floor but says nothing.I glance down at the paper again.Let me run a theory by you.""What theory?""Say... say that Eizenstat believes this Ex Nihilo -- whoever that is -- speaks to us in our dreams.That he manipulates us through them -- when we're asleep in the vecta-coffins."I pause, waiting for Juliet to speak.She doesn't."Say that you believe that much, and so you needed someone who *cant* be manipulated.I bet there aren't many others like me...

She sighs and her shoulders fall.Yes, there are few like you.*None* like you, would be more accurate.You've been letting yourself age for the past twenty years.

Like you said, Im a freak.

She looks up at me and smiles.Unique.Someone who will let themselves age until they die."She laughs."Very unique."I shift uncomfortably in my seat."Yeah, well..."

"If we're right -- if someone is manipulating our dreams, then there's no one else I can trust.Plus, youre ready to die -- that could be useful to me.

I let out a short laugh."How reassuring.""You wanted to hear the truth.""What happens when we sleep?"I dont know, exactly.No one does.The technology has just... always been there -- since before the Restart.We know that it cleans us; we know that it cures us.That it holds back ageing -- but we don't understand the technology that allows the 'vecta-coffins' to work.As such, we can't create more -- hence the population limit. 

Right.And what do you know about Eden?

About this Eden?Nothing.There were tales of the Eden from Christianity, but that's it.Just mythology.""That's it?"I challenge."That's it.We found the paper I showed you from the code Eizenstat provided.

I think for a moment.What if any link to this 'Eden' was removed from the archives by Omin?

Impossible.No one gets in our out -- not even me.No one has clearance to enter; if I need something from it, I ask the librarians and they find it.

Yeah*the librarians*."I pause for a moment and let my mind sink into the abyss outside the window."If you're lying to me Juliet -- about any of this -- I'm going to find out.

"If I was, you'd find out soon I think.We're approaching the coordinates.

I glance back out of the window.The echoes of a once great civilisation lie on the ocean bed beneath  us -- piles of concrete and indistinguishable grey rubble.The stubs of once great towers that aimed for the heavens.*Castles of sand.*

Then we see it.A huge, domed complex lying on the ocean bed, looms in the distance.Its dim neon light penetrates the void, gradually brightening as we approach.Eden, Juliet says, quietly.Reverently.I can only let out a slow whistle."The lights... it's still functional," Juliet whispers.Sure was lucky Eden was waterproof."What do you mean?

Just that I'm willing to bet that facility is *much* more recent than New York.That dome around it -- the entire complex was purposely designed to exist down here, on the ocean floor."Juliet frowns."Why would someone build in the Plagued Ocean?That doesn't make any sense.""It makes sense, I say slowly, "if you don't want to be found."---

Richardson slid down the tunnel first, landing on his rear in a small pile of sand."What is this place?"Richardson asked, as Kate helped pull him up off the ground.He had come out into a wide, stone chamber, dimly lit by numerous, radiant symbols on the walls."I'm really not sure, but I'm hoping Kirby can tell us something.The draft seems to be coming from down there," she said, pointing left, "I think that's our way out.""Okay, good," Richardson replied."What about that corridor?"he asked, pointing to a gloomy doorway opposite him."Your guess is as good as mine.Want me to check it out?""Not yet."Richardson cupped his hands together and yelled up the tunnel."Kirby!Come on down!"A moment later, the stout engineer came flying down the tunnel, landing firmly on the sand."Could have warned me," he grumbled, rubbing his behind as he got to his feet."What do you make of these symbols?"Richardson asked.There were at least a dozen images, each roughly three foot in length.They seemed to come part way off the wall, and all let out a warm, but dull, yellow light.Richardson recognised a few of them - a bird that was maybe a crow, and next to that a tree that looked as if it was wilting.Another symbol looked like a baby, the small legs and arms wrapped around its tiny body.He thought that maybe another - a long stick with a hooked end - was a scythe, but he couldn't be sure."I'm not a symbologist, or a historian," Kirby said, approaching the branching tree, "but it looks like it's powered by-"

As the engineer reached a hand out toward the symbol, it began to shift.Particles danced and undulated and the image began to change."It's made of *sand*," he said, perplexed."And it reacted to me.""How does it work?""Damned if I know.I guess it can't *just* be sand.Maybe there are magnetised particles within the grains."The image began to settle again, but it had transformed into two triangles set on top of each other; the lower triangle pointed up, the second pointed down - their tips touching perfectly.The lower triangle was hollow - just a sandy outline of a triangle.A sudden scraping noise came from one of the corridors, followed by a thud that reverberated through both the room, and Richardson's bones."Oh shit," he said, already running down the tunnel toward where the sound had come from.He didn't have far to go before he reached the the huge slab of stone blocking his way.It had a thin white coating, like that on the droid they'd run into."We need a new way out," he informed the others as he returned to the chamber."Captain," said Kate as she stared at the new symbol.The uppermost triangle was dripping sand into the lower."It's a timer.We've set off some kind of security device.""I'm sorry, Captain," said Kirby, his cheeks now crimson.Richardson reached out and tried to touch the clock, but a white sheen of electricity flashed across it as his finger neared, and he pulled back."Are you okay?"Kate asked."Yeah - not much worse than a static shock," he replied, shaking his finger.He watched the timer intently for a few seconds."Looks like we've got about ninety minutes to stop it.I really don't want to know what happens when the time runs out," Richardson said, turning to his engineer."Maybe it's a kind of code-lock.Try changing the other symbols, or deactivating the power.Just... see what you can do, Kirby."Kirby nodded."On it."Richardson reached into a pocket and pulled out a tiny black device."Celeron, come in.Is anyone there?This is Captain Richardson."A dancing static was all that responded.He sighed and put the device away."Kate, you're with me," he said, turning to his lieutenant."Let's check out the other corridor."The tunnel wound deep into the ground, almost corkscrewing.The chest area of their skinsuits emitted an eerie light, like that of a flash-light, only it swung and moved with their bodies.They hadn't gone far, when they came across the body."Jesus," said Kate."What happened to him."The man's eyes were wide open and a look of dread was cemented on his face.His hands were chained to the wall behind him.For a moment, Richardson thought he might still be alive, but then his light shone on the man's legs.All skin, muscle and sinews had been removed from them, leaving only bright white bone, attached to an intact groin.The blood on the floor underneath the man was still pooled and wet."It wasn't done long ago," said Richardson."Come on, we've got to keep moving."Kate removed her phaser."I'm keeping this out."As they walked, the image of the man haunted Richardson.The bone was so clean, it was as if a pack of animals had eaten the man - but that they were saving the rest of the meat for later.Kate gave words to a terrible idea that he was trying desperately to keep at bay."What if they're harvesting us?"she asked."..."

"You know - letting Earth's grow to say, fifty billion people or so, but stopping us before we become truly space faring.""We're at seventy - and we're pretty well spread out.""Yeah, well.Maybe we're some kind of anomaly."They walked the next part of the passageway in silence.---

Lieutenant Hitchcock threw the prisoner down onto his knees in front of Rework.There was a bag over the man's head, and his arms were chained behind his back."What gift have you wrapped up for me this time, lieutenant?"Rework growled through his mask."Morphine.Son of a bitch killed three good officers in the process."Hitchcock breathed in deeply, then spat a thick, green glob onto the prisoner's bare back."Modern art, right?"Rework said nothing."Personally," Hitchcock continued, "I'd toss this one into a tiny cell and throw away the key.But... "

Rework nodded, as if he understood.Hitchcock doubted he did.The superhero had become so disconnected from the real world over the last few years.Once upon a time, he used to patrol the streets -- now he rarely left his gloomy mansion, instead waiting like a spider in a web, for another villain to fall into it.To be *deposited* into it -- mainly by him and his men.Okay sure.Sometimes by the other heroes, but there weren't many of them left.Not anymore."You look troubled, lieutenant.Don't worry, he's in good hands.His mind will be erased and replaced by something much prettier.He is to be a bodyguard for the Mayor, you know?Totally subservient.A brand new, law abiding, man.*

Liquid streamed down the prisoner's leg, pooling on the wooden floor."Please," came a muffled, desperate cry, "just kill me.""Patience,"  growled Rework."first you're going to do a little cleaning.Then, well, then you'll get * changed.*"

 Hitchcock frowned.This didn't feel right.It hadn't in a long time.But... ah, hell, maybe it was still the best solution.He scratched his beard.He was getting old.How much longer could be stay on the force?He looked up at Rework; the superhero's hair bristled over the clockwork mask he wore and was flecked with whites and greys.Things would change soon, one way or another."Leave me, lieutenant.It is time I began."Hitchcock nodded, turned and walked away.Muffled screams accompanied him like a church organ as he headed to the door.---

Rework walked through the corridors of his mansion, his steps echoing bravely around him.Morphine had been given his new identity, and for today, his work was done.*Almost* done.He opened the cellar door and turned on the light.The steps creaked beneath him as he descended.Rework walked to the northern-most wall, then pressed his palm hard against a moulding brick.The wall slowly opened.A skinny, wisp of a man was chained against a wall inside the new room.His bones pressed against the skin of his torso, as if any second they might tear out.Slowly, the man raised his head to look at the visitor.His shaggy hair covered all but his emerald eyes, that somehow sparkled even in the dark."I've brought you some food, James," said Rework, emptying out a can into a bowl on the floor.Gloopy, translucent meat plopped out."Please..." said the chained man, his voice hoarse as if he'd swallowed broken glass."Oh, no need to thank me.I wouldn't want you starving to death. "The prisoner licked his lips, trying to wet them, but his tongue was like dust."How much... Longer... Must I..."

 Rework smiled."Not long.I have just told Morphine - do you remember him?- what his new identity will be.Even an idiot like him should be able to act for a day.He is my final chess piece to be positioned.""Then you... kill me?""Oh, James."Rework dragged a stool to the prisoner and sat down."Do you know, that when I killed my beloved Maria, I swore I'd kill you in the same way.I swear now, I will not.*Not ever.* Believe me, that's not easy for me.But I came back to this time for different reasons.Not just to destroy you.Not just to see my Maria when she was happy "

 "Please..."

 "Soon, the criminals that they think I -*you*- altered, they will be in their positions.Ready to destroy *everything.* And you'll be with me to watch it all burn.You'll be blam-"

The man on the stool suddenly got up, fully alert.He'd heard *something* " A creak, perhaps.He rushed into the main cellar, but... *nothing*.If someone had been there... had heard him....It would take years to create another time distortion.No, he couldn't change things this time.Plans would just have to be sped up.---

Hitchcock waited breathlessly behind the door at the top of the cellar.Each beat of his heart was another thunderous creak, louder to him than the first.He was certain he'd be found, by... *whoever* that Rework impostor was.But as seconds turned into minutes, he dared to breathe.To move.---

The woman wore a torn white dress, that revealed as much skin as it covered.Her face was stained red with dried blood and her left eye was swollen and purple."Run!"she repeated, her entire body trembling.Richardson slowly got to his feet, keeping his hands spread and raised above him."We're not going to harm you."The microphone at the top of his skinsuit swallowed his voice, only to project out a translated version toward the woman.She locked eyes with Richardson for a second.Then, her head raised and she took a sharp intake of breath, as a tiny spear tore through her chest, flying onward toward the bottom of the dune.A rain of red speckled Richardson's suit, as the woman collapsed onto the desert floor.A small, white object hovered over where the woman had been standing.Around its edges were a circular row of darts, marred only by a single, empty space.The object rotated slightly, as it aimed a dart at Richardson.Kate dived at him, tackling him by his legs and bringing him hard to the ground - the dart whistled by, only inches above."What is that thing?"yelled Pirano.He began to scramble down the other side of the dune, taking cover behind the mass of sand.Richardson, recovered from the shock, grabbed the phaser from his belt and aimed at the machine.The beam bounced harmlessly off the droid and sailed high into the air."Shit," said Richardson.The machine moved forward and hovered over Kate and the captain.It angled itself toward them."Shit," said Kate.The phaser shattered into pieces as Richardson used it to enhance his uppercut.The droid rocked sideways and its white covering cracked open.Richardson thrust an arm inside the machine and tugged on a stew of red wires and black goo, ripping them away from it.The machine hovered a second longer, then fell heavily to the floor.Richardson took a deep breath."Crew - you all okay?""Just about," said Kate."I'm good," replied Kirby.Richardson looked around."Where's Pirano?""No idea," said Kate."Probably made a run for it when he saw trouble.""Over here," said Kirby, pointing to a large footprint."There's more of them."The group began track the sandy trail, as it led them down the far slope of the dune."Are we going to talk about that thing?How it killed the lady?"asked Kate, a note of anguish in her voice."What the hell is something that advanced doing in a place like this?And why is it...aggressive?""Let's find Pirano first, then we'll talk about it," answered Richardson.The trail came to an abrupt end about half way down the dune."Maybe the wind blew sand over them?"suggested Kirby.The three split up, searching the area for a continuation of the prints.Kate accidentally discovered the answer - she screamed as the ground below began to swallow her up.Richardson had turned in time to see where she'd fallen.He ran over to the place, but it had somehow been covered up in sand.He placed a single foot on the anomalous area, applying a little pressure.His foot burst through a thin layer of surface sand - there was no resistance beneath it.He got down to his knees, and pushed his head through the sandy covering.Below was a pit, of some kind, but it was too dark to see anything."Kate?"he yelled, into the void.His voice echoed as it travelled the tract.Nothing."Kate!"he yelled again."I'm okay!"came the reply.A wave of blissful relief ran over Richardson."Kate!Thank God.Can you get back up?""No - no chance.""Is Pirano down there with you?""No.But I think maybe you're going to want to get down here.I'm in a... large chamber, and there are dozens of glowing symbols on the wall.And well, it's some kind of technology.Maybe Kirby will be able to make something of it.""Is there a way out of there, if we do come down?""Yeah.There are two doorways, and I can feel a breeze coming from one of them."Richardson looked at Kirby.Kirby shrugged."Hold tight - we're coming down."---

Each time the passageway split, they went right.After ten minutes of walking, Richardson tapped Kate on her shoulder and raised a finger to his lips."What is it?"she whispered."Turn off your light.Someone's coming."They pushed themselves back against the passageway's wall and allowed the curtain of darkness to drape over them.Soon, she heard the footsteps too.Torchlight began to flow down the corridor, gradually becoming brighter.Richardson glanced toward the light, and made out a familiar, limping silhouette, behind it."Pirano?"Richardson asked, stepping away from the wall and switching his own light back on.The silhouette jumped back in surprise."Captain!"Pirano exclaimed.His face was pale and covered in sweat, but a smile crept over his lips when he saw Richardson.Kate switched her light back on."Lieutenant, too!Thank God.*Thank God!* I thought I was going to die down here all alone!- It'll be good to have company!"He began to laugh."What happened to you?"Richardson asked.Pirano's eyes widened and he gazed into the distance."I... was making a tactical retreat from the metallic monster, when I plummeted down a trap door beneath the sand.Captain - we need to get to the pyramid.I've seen some terrible things down here.""Mm," Richardson grunted, "so have we.Kirby set off some kind of trap that's blocked the exit.We're looking for another way out.""What kind of trap?"Pirano replied urgently."There were moving symbols on the wall.He touched an image of a tree and it shifted - transformed - into a sand timer.We've got less than eighty minutes before it fills.""What were the other symbols?""I didn't recognise all of them.There was the tree... a baby, a bird - I think, oh and a tool that looked somewhat like a scythe."Oh God, why didn't we see it before?Quick - where is Kirby?"Pirano pleaded."Trying to deactivate it.""He needs to succeed!""Easy there - we don't know what will happen if it runs out.Perhaps it will just reset itself to a tree, after the timer ends - maybe it's in a temporary lockout right now.""Fools!"Pirano spat.He leaned forward and grabbed hold of Richardson's skinsuit, tugging it toward him."If that alarm goes off, more of *them* will come.Ships!If more come..." his eyes shifted first left then right, and his voice lowered to a whisper, "they'll find us.Our own ship will lead them back to Earth -*our* Earth, I mean.""Pirano," Kate began, "what do you know?"Pirano panted hard and wiped spit away from his lips."I don't.I just... *suspect*.You suspect it too, don't you Kate?""Are we some kind of... *food*, to them?""Yes.But we are far more than that to them.We are game.They raise us.They hunt us.Then, they devour us.""And then, once they wipe us out, they plant new seeds," Richardson added, "for future hunts.Is that it?""Yes.They grow us from samples they will always have saved.That they've *collected*.""Who are they, Pirano?""You've not guessed?"Richardson shook his head."They're the first *us*.Humanity.They are what we become."----

"Where are you taking me?"I asked him, panting hard as I tried to match his great strides.His dark cloak billowed behind him as he strode, blown by a fierce cosmic wind.His scythe swung and shimmered in his arm."To the others," he said, "but we must hurry.""No," I said, stopping dead in the black tunnel, trying to catch my breath."I have to know - are you taking me to heaven, or to hell?"He turned to me and his eye sockets blazed."Do not worry about where *I* am taking you, worry about where you'll go if I am not successful in getting you there."I swallowed hard, and nodded.We began again, Death walking, me almost sprinting as I attempted to keep up.The sides of the tunnel danced with irridecent starlight, and I knew beyond doubt that we were leaving my universe.Eventually, we came to a door of bone.Death muttered an incomprehensible sound and it slowly creeped open.He grabbed my hand and pulled me through.The door slammed shut behind us; Death's shoulders slumped slightly, as he finally relaxed."What is this place..." I whispered.High above us were three huge cherry-red moons, bathing the field of white grass below, in a pale, blood-like light.On the field itself were dozens of shacks and tents.It was a great camp and it was brimming with bustling life.To the side of the largest tent, I saw two armoured figures dueling with swords.I could hear the metallic ringing of the steel blades as they collided."There's a battle!"I said, pointing to the scene."There is not battle here.Not yet," Death replied."They are preparing for the inevitable, however.That," he said, pointing to the smaller of the two figures, "is Joan of Arc.She is training our army for the battle.""*The* Joan of Arc?"I asked incredulously.At that moment the larger figure fell to the ground, and the smaller pointed a sword at his chest."Yes.I have almost a thousand souls now.It is all I've been able to smuggle here.They are all very valuable to me - yourself included.""Smuggle?But... you're Death.Don't you deliver *all* souls?""Once, I did so.Now, I take when I can - when *she* is not looking - and I ready them for our battle.""Our battle?Against the Devil, you mean?""The Devil is long since dead.""Dead?Then... then you mean to make war with God!""God is imprisoned.""...imprisoned?That can't be.God is, well, *God*."Death sighed."Yet, it is so.There are greater evils than the Devil.An evil that tortures the souls of the dead, in a way the Devil could only dream of.And there are greater powers than God."Death struck his scythe on the ground, and turned to me as the world beneath began to tremble."Look around you.*We* are the unholy resistance.Soon the war of the souls begins."---

The water of the Plagued Ocean is like syrup, and each stroke I take is an intense exertion; with every movement, my arms and legs scream in protest.I wonder how the hell Juliet's coping.I keep my flashlight locked on her, the best I can at any rate.She's still a few feet in front.I feel the gun holstered around my waist bite into my skin, and it's somewhat reassuring -- although in this water, a bullet won't get far.Ahead -- far above us -- the peak of the domed structure shines a radiant orange, luring us to it like sailors to a Siren's song.For a moment, I let my mind wander to the immense pressure of the water around me.Only a thin layer of nano-poly stops our lungs from being crushed like beer cans under a boot.Juliet suddenly darts back.Bubbles stream out from her mask.She waves her arms around her as if she's caught in slow motion.Something's terrified her.Then I see them.The two blood-diamonds smouldering in the water to our right; moving rapidly towards us; growing.I reach for my gun, but I'm too slow.As the creature brushes past us we're pushed down by a violent current, almost to the ocean floor.The dark body of the creature must be huge to cause such turbulence.I steady myself and grab my pistol.I make slow, searching arcs; it takes me a moment to spot the red eyes again.I wait for it to draw near --  It has to be so close; my bullets might as well be stabs of a dagger in this water.The eyes are growing rapidly; I wait... wait...But just before the eyes reach me, the creature changes direction and darts away into the darkness above.We wait a few minutes, barely daring to breath into our masks -- but it doesn't come again.I holster my gun and tap Juliet's shoulder.I point to the domed structure and try to explain that we're near to the entrance we saw from the sub.I nod encouragingly and finally, she begins to swim.We reach the black archway at the base of the dome.To its side is a metal plate.I push my hand against it and mutter a prayer beneath by breath.The plate falls inwards and the archway lifts open; we're sucked inside a narrow chamber, along with a hundred tons of the Plagued Sea.The door closes and the water begins to drain.After a few minutes, it's gone completely and Juliet and I are standing, dripping, on a gridded floor in a black tunnel.The light's almost blinding as the doors the other end of the chamber lift.We glance at each other, nod, then take our first cautious steps into Eden.---

Juliet rips off her mask and peels back the hood of her suit."What the hell was that thing?""I'm not sure you want to know," I say, as I remove my own."Nothing could survive down there.I mean, *nothing!* -- that water is toxic as Hell.""Sure," I say."That's it?*Sure?* We almost got devoured by a mutant sea creature that shouldn't exist and-"

"I don't think it was a creature," I interject.Juliet's brows furrow."Excuse me?""I don't think it was alive, exactly.And I don't think it wanted to hurt us.If it had *wanted* to, we'd both be dead.""... you mean it was a *machine?*"

I nod."Yeah.A scout, or some type of surveillance.It might have even been our first run in with Ex Nihilo -- or at least part of it.""I don't understand.""Nor me.Not yet"

A neon-light at the apex of the dome caresses the city in front of us, drenching it in an orange fuzz; the light gently reflects off the pristine white tiles beneath us.I don't see a single damaged, or even soiled, tile.In the distance are massive, homogeneous structures, that look a little like warehouses.Tiny blue lights suddenly come to life either side of the tiles we're standing on, as if they're designating a path."I didn't realise paradise would be so... *clinical*," Juliet says as we begin walking along it."You noticed the light up there since we came in?"I ask.Juliet looks up, covering her eyes with a hand."What about it?""It's a deeper orange than when we were in the sub.Almost *red*.""It's a sun?""Makes sense for this place to have a day-night cycle," I muse."A lot of people must have worked here at some point.I doubt they'd be doing daily trips back to the surface."The path soon splits, but in the intersection between paths is an ornamental pedestal.The white rock of its surface is fissured by dark veins."Marble," whispers Juliet, as if in awe.I shrug."I guess you'd kn--."There's a blinding eruption above the pedestal; I step back, snatching my pistol from around my waist and squinting at my target."I don't think that'll do much good," says Juliet, as she calmly places a hand on my shoulder.I begin to see it now.The light is coalescing; its colours flowing and merging as they begin to form an image."Welcome to Eden Research Facility,"  says a softly spoken lady hovering above the pedestal.She has long blonde hair and there's a halo of light around her; her body flickers as her arms spread wide."If you're part of the Human-Too initiative, please check-in at the Delta-Kew reception.If you're Memory ReBirth team, please visit the Gamma-Kew reception.If you're a member of project Elixyr, please visit Sigma-Kew reception.You will be assigned living quarters upon arriving at your designated reception.Finally, if you are one of the *Lucky Few:*  Congratulations, from all of us!Please make your way to Epsilon-Kew; we do so hope you enjoy living in Eden!"The hologram's colours begin to leak into one another as its form melts and shifts into a rectangle.Where a woman had been only a few seconds before, is now a holographic map of the entire facility.I turn to Juliet."I get why this place was called Eden.*Elixirs, Memory ReBirth* -- I bet you this is where it *all* came from.Vecta-coffins, Step-Backs -- the research all began here.""My father created the Step-Back," Juliet says indignantly."Yeah?Say for a moment that he didn't.That he just *thought* he created the technology."She lets out a frustrated sigh."Even if it came from here, which I doubt, it doesn't explain why a *research station* was built underwater.""Maybe... maybe they were doing something down here that they weren't meant to be doing.'Human-Too' -- I think Eizenstat was right about this place being to do with cloning.Perhaps someone wanted to create a slave labour force and had to do it out of sight."Juliet shakes her head."You wouldn't use clones for labour.You'd use subservient AI, like we do.Androids will always outperform humans -- cloned or non-cloned."She's right.I scratch my chin as I consider."Okay, how about this: maybe humanity was on the brink of global extinction.This research facility was a last ditch gambit to kick start the population.Hell, maybe the surface was uninhabitable when this was built -- you only need to look at what they did to the sea.""Maybe," Juliet says."Perhaps we knew we were going to become extinct, but when the time was right, the technology down here would bring us back from the dead.""Maybe," Juliet repeats, sounding even more unconvinced.I look up at the map: the facility is vast -- hundreds of marked buildings divided into a dozen different sections.In the centre of the complex is a green circle: *Garden of Eden*.It takes me a few minutes to spot what I'm after."Building 93j, Alpha Kew," I say, pointing to a cherry-red section on the right of the map."That's where Eizenstat will be -- if he's here at all.""What makes you think that?"I spout off the code he'd gave to Omin."2087.93jAkew.92hsA."Juliet looks at me, her lips creased in a slight smile.She's impressed."Well, what are we waiting for?"she asks.---

Death felt like it had been an eternity since he had last been here.So much had changed since his time.Even the air felt different - less *oppressive*.A small, many legged creature scuttled across the floor, stopping for only a moment to open its single eye and look up at Death.Then it *remembered*, and ran hastily into a hole at the side of the cavern.Death pressed on, deeper into the bowel of the caves - deeper into the darkness - until eventually he saw an orange glow bouncing off a distant wall.As he turned the corner and neared the great river of lava, the heat began to rise, until it felt like he was in the middle of a blazing inferno.His cloak began to smoulder.A single, wooden boat bobbed on the lava on the near side of the lake.The remains of the Ferryman lay inside, his stiff, skeletal hands still firmly attached to the oars - his soul long departed.Death stepped into the tiny vessel and pried the oars from the skeleton's stiff fingers.The last time he had been on this boat had been so different.His wrists had been chained, and his bones had worn skin.The Ferryman had been just as silent, however.As he rowed, he thought of his army and wondered if he had done the right thing by sending them into an almost hopeless war.Joan's army would be defeated, that much was certain.Perhaps that had already happened.He wondered if his tiny team of three would even make it up the wall - let alone get as far as the dungeons.He doubted it.He doubted he would be able to complete his task either, but he had to have faith.He had to try.He owed it to humanity.----

The arrows flew by my face and my hair danced in the gust.The first struck the nearest creature in its neck and it fell squirming to the ground.The next creature shifted its head into its body just in time, and the arrow sailed harmlessly past.The third and fourth arrows hit its body and were swallowed into the creature.But the fifth caught its target in the center of its re-emerging face, and it collapsed instantly.Perhaps Meja could take down another couple at most, I thought, before she either runs out of arrows, or they are upon us.On my right side, Ishida had stepped forward to meet the other six.He bowed curtly, before unleashing his blades from their sheaths in a flurry of silver-light.The first creature swiped a clawed arm at him, but he stepped back easily and sliced the protruding limb off.The creature let out a violent scream and its stomach began to bubble.A new arm thrust out from within it.I saw, for the first time I could recall, Ishida smiling."I'm out of arrows!"cried Meja.I turned in time to see one of the two remaining creatures charging at us.I stepped in front of Meja and reached to my back,  withdrawing my steel."Come on then, you son of a bitch!"I yelled.The creature came near and... *stopped*."What are you waiting for?"I screamed, spit flying from my mouth.Its eyes lit a devilish red as it pounced.I ducked in time and rolled out the way.It was a half-second later I realised *I* hadn't been the creatures intended target.It was on top of Meja and a clawed arm was thundering down toward her face.I stretched forward and grabbed one of the creatures legs, pulling it hard toward me.It fell to the ground, its claw missing Meja's face by an inch and denting the marble beneath.Meja reacted instantly, taking a knife from her belt, rolling left, and thrusting her weapon deep into the stunned creature's head.But now the second creature was on us.I raised my sword above my head, hoping to shield some of the blows as it swung its arms at me.But no blows arrived.Ishida was by our side, his swords singing as they danced through the air.He cut three times; two of the creature's arms fell to the ground, followed by the head.I looked at Ishida, and then at the half-dozen creatures he had been fighting.All that remained of them were scattered piles of limbs and heads."I hope you don't mind me joining you," Ishida said, "but you were being very slow."Meja began to laugh."You're pretty handy with those swords," I said, getting to my feet.I offered Meja a hand and pulled her up off the ground."I think, perhaps, you need more lessons," said Ishida, still grinning."Once this is over, you'll have eternity to teach me," I replied."Maybe eternity is not long enough," he said thoughtfully."Is that right?"I laughed."We don't have time - they know we're here," Meja cut in, as she bent down to recover an arrow.I nodded."We've got to get going.""Where now?"Ishida asked.I took a deep breath before speaking."The most direct route.Through the forest of crucifixes."----

I couldn't see the angels in the darkness, but the sound of cracking of wood as they escaped the crucifix's, stalked me as I ran.I knew Meja and Ishida were some way ahead, but I'd lost them to the heavy blackness.I didn't see the creature beneath me, but I felt its vice like grip as it wrapped a hand around my leg and brought me crashing to the ground.I tried to draw my sword, so as to slice the angel's arm and free my leg - but I couldn't pull my weapon from its scabbard.I glanced behind, only to see that a pulsating wine-red vine, bursting with thorns, had wrapped itself around my blade.I drew my free leg back, and aimed my boot at the angel's head.Its neck snapped violently back with a hideous crack - but a moment later, it slowly rose upright again.I pulled my leg back, readying to kick a second time - but another vine leapt out of the undergrowth like a snake, and coiled tightly around my shin.Its thorns bit into my leg and I screamed in anguish.The angel pulled itself over me, its jaw clicking as it dislocated, its mouth opening unnaturally wide.An arrow tore through the vine on my leg.I hurriedly pulled the remains of the plant away and kicked hard at the angel, knocking it slightly back.The second arrow freed my blade.In one swift motion, I reached around, withdrew it and brought it down on the angel's arm.The creature let go of my leg, but the blow had barely scratched its leathery skin.Meja tucked her arms under my shoulders and pulled me to my feet."You're heavier than you look," she said, grunting.She grabbed my hand, and we ran.The crucifixes became more dispersed as we neared the edge of the forest, and eventually we came out onto a marble plateau.Behind us, the fallen angels still followed, relentless in their pursuit."Where's Ishida?"I asked."I don't know," she replied."I lost him even before I turned back for you.Maybe he's in there," she said, pointing to the smouldering remains of a basilica a little way in the distance.The structure was still mostly intact, but much of the roof had collapsed inward.The brick was singed and black."But if he's not..." 

"I don't think we have much choice," I said, as the angels neared us.This time, I grabbed her hand, and together we made our way toward the basilica.***

A single iron door hung crooked on its remaining hinge.It took both our efforts to pull it open.I glanced behind me before stepping inside.The angels had stopped chasing us a little way from the basilica, and I could hear them hissing and whispering in the distance.They were afraid to come nearer.Perhaps the building was still sacred to them, in some way."He didn't come in here," Meja said miserably, as she looked down at the dusty floor."Maybe he found another way in," I said, attempting to reassure her."Or perhaps he found somewhere else to shelter."Meja looked at me, her blue eyes large and wide."*They took him.*"

"We don't know that for sure," I snapped."And, even if they did," I said, my voice softening, "he wouldn't want us to mourn.We'll finish this, for him."She tried to smile, but her lips trembled.Instead, she nodded and turned away from me.We walked silently into the main hall of the great church.Bricks from the roof collapse littered the floor, along with the shattered remains of stained-glass windows.The glass crunched loudly under my boots, but as always, Meja made no sound as she walked.Around the edges of the church were ancient murals, blackened by ash and smoke.I walked to the nearest wall and wiped a mural clean with my sleeve.The image seemed to depict a great war between Heaven and Hell.The bodies of many angels and demons littered a field, while the remaining clashed with swords and shields.Above the scene, the hand of God broke out from a dark cloud.A bolt of lighting had left his fingertip and was travelling down toward a demon.I left the image and clambered over a pile of debris lying high in the center of the church.As I reached the top, I heard Meja call me.I saw her standing by the front altar with our map spread out over the stone communion table."Come, Christian," she said."Take a look at this."---

Death stepped out of the boat and onto the bank.Three huge tunnels had been carved in the cavern's wall.He paused for a moment as he thought, before walking down the left most passage.The tunnel was wide and dark, and the warmth of the lava quickly gave way to a chill that ran deep into his bones.He had not gone far when he spotted the first eyes leering at him from the darkness.Yellow and bloodshot and shining brightly.Soon many more pairs of glowing eyes accompanied it, on either side of him.The tunnel was almost pitch-black and he could not see what creatures they belonged to.The eyes began to grow larger; the creatures were approaching him.He could now make out their hideous, pointed teeth, as their mouths dropped open in anticipation.He ran his scythe in a large circle around him, and flames of white and blue spewed forth from it.The eyes soon became fainter, as the creatures scuttled back into the darkness.Soon, they vanished completely.A deep trembling sound reverberated around him and shook the tunnel.*A voice.*

"Welcome home, Death."---

The clouds had thickened as we'd descended the wall, and a muted darkness had fallen over the Kingdom.There was a damp gloom around us that felt almost *alive* - I could feel it trying to worm its way into my soul.It pushed down on me from within, squeezing my chest and making each step I took a burden.We all felt it, I think, but we said nothing and pressed on.In front of us was the first of the many crucifixes.In the distance, to my right, I could just about make out the dim glow of the sea of blood.Meja wrapped her arms around her body as she looked up at the cross.The angel's wings, arms and feet had been nailed to the wood, and its head hung limp.Its face, high above us, was shrouded in darkness.I wondered if the angel had fought the demons to the end, or if it had surrendered and hoped for mercy, only for *this* to be its fate.I hoped it was the former."Should we take it down?"asked Meja."No," I replied."We don't have time.Besides, there are thousands of them."A white light ripped through the air, and for a terrible moment, I saw the angel's face.Its eye sockets were hollow and blood had dribbled down from the empty space.Some kind of black mould covered its skin in a thousand, tiny dots.The mould seemed to be eating the skin; the left cheek was mostly bone.But what made my blood run cold, was seeing its pale lips curl up into a grin.I stood there, frozen, until darkness engulfed the face once more and thunder bellowed like a drum."Did you see that?"I asked."Its face?"asked Meja."Yes.How could they do that to it?Remove an angel's eyes..."

"You didn't see its lips?""Lips?What about them?""It - it doesn't matter," I said, praying it was my imagination running rampant."Rain," said Ishida holding out his hand.Soon I felt the sticky, warm wetness falling from the clouds.The drops were thick and black."Blood," I corrected him.The crucifixes weren't in rows.There wasn't any order to them, and walking through them was like trying to navigate our way through a jungle.It was too dark to look at the map - the moon was lost behind tumbling, violet clouds.Beneath our feet, the marble had been swallowed by ivy and moss and a hundred other weeds.At times, they curled their way up around the crucifixes, and even occasionally, the angels on them.We walked in a line: me at the front, then Meja, then Ishida bringing up the rear.The cursed rain was falling faster and the wind had become a force of its own, whipping the rain onto our faces and pushing against us as we walked."Do you hear that?"asked Ishida, about half way through the forest.We stopped still and listened.But all I could hear was the rain falling, punctuated occasionally by the distant rumble of thunder."Just the rain," I said."There's nothing," chimed Meja in agreement.Ishida nodded reluctantly, and we carried on.Then I heard it.A slow, cracked, whisper - the words long and drawn out.*She is waking.* 

*She will hear you.* 

*She will have your soul.* 

"I hear it," I said, stopping once again."So do I," said Meja, grabbing an arrow from her quiver."Where are they?"she asked, pulling back her bow and turning slowly.*She will devour your soul.*

"It's the angels," I said."Let's keep going.Quickly."But it was too late.Wood splintered as the nearest angel ripped itself away from its crucifix, leaving the metal nails, and the surrounding flesh, attached to the cross.It fell to the floor, crawling toward us.The pointed, bone stumps of its once great wings flapped frantically as it moved.*I will deliver you unto her.*

Ishida drew his swords and stepped toward the creature.He raised his weapons above his head and swung down.The fallen angel raised its arms in time and caught the blades in its hands, to the sound of grating steel.The angel yanked them - and Ishida - toward it.Meja let an arrow fly; it found its target and pierced the angel's head - but the creature did not seem to notice.It opened its mouth, revealing a row of jagged teeth, and pulled Ishida toward its terrible maw.I sprinted toward it and aimed a roundhouse kick to its face.There was a crunch as my boot connected with it, and the creatures neck snapped back, its head falling down beneath the blades of its wings.A gurgling sound emanated from it and it released Ishida's swords.But a second later, it began crawling toward us once again.There was another explosion of thunder.*No* - It wasn't thunder, it was a second angel tearing itself from its cross in an explosion of rotting wood.And then another, and another."Run," I yelled."Run!"---

Consciousness had been slow to return to me, but Meja had been waiting by my side, in the room of light, for the entire time.As I recovered, she explained to me what had transpired after I had entered the beast's chest.A white light had erupted from within *her*, spreading rapidly and consuming the spores of mould that made up the creature's body.I had slain the beast, and in doing so, God had been freed.The creatures on the battlefield still fought on to the bitter end - but that had not been far away.God was only be able to save a few of our fallen - those whose hearts had not stopped; those whose souls the beast had not already engulfed.I was one of the lucky few.---

Death was granted a pardon for his ancient sin, but humanity would always need a *Death*.God explained that there must always be a reaper of souls; a shepherd for the lost.Death's head fell and his shoulders slumped as he prepared to return to his eternal task - but then Meja spoke up.She suggested to God that Death didn't *need* to be Adam - that he had more than earned his freedom.We - *the souls of heaven* - would take it in turns to be the reaper, to take the burden from his tired shoulders.*We* agreed unanimously.Every soul and every demon cheered Adam's name, as skin and muscle began to blossom over his bones.Adam walked away from us, toward the Kingdom of Heaven.He glanced back only briefly, before drifting out of sight, and as he did, I saw his smile, and I saw too his tears.---

Satan was gone, and of that even God could do nothing.But Ymmayn - that was the great dragon's name - was given new power, along with the crown of the underworld.Even in heaven, Ymmayn was held as something of a hero.Satan was one of only many devoured by the beast.So too was *Saint* Joan of Arc, whose small army of resistance had brought us the time we needed to free the souls of humanity and begin the counter attack.Only three souls from her army had survived, one of whom was a man named Frederick.When his bloodied, battered remains had been found, it was thought he was another lost soul, until someone saw his fingers slowly move.He was attempting to grip the bugle that lay by his side; trying desperately to bring it to his cracked lips.God blessed Frederick, and the angel - that is what he became - took the place of the fallen Saint Peter, at the gate of Heaven.Frederick always held the bugle by his side and is said to have played it for each new soul that entered.---


Ishida looked quite grand in the hooded, black kimono, with white belt around his waist and two swords tucked in.He first hugged Meja, and then embraced me."We'll meet again, my friend," he said, patting me on my shoulders."And when we do, I will finish teaching you how to use your weapon."He took his blades and drew a circle on the floor around him.Bright light erupted from it.Then, *Death* was gone.I grinned thinking about the poor souls that would see the fierce warrior appear by their side.God help them, if they resisted following him.---

Outside the Kingdom itself, Heaven was, well, whatever you *wanted* it to be.Meja suggested that we sail the Nordic lakes together, liberating villages from raiders, for a few years.I negotiated her down to a much calmer cruise, at least to start with.After all, we had eternity at our disposal - *why rush?*

She took my hand, and together we stepped onto the wooden vessel.---

The End.-

He had not always been known as Death.Once - in a time long ago - he had owned a different name.A *human* name.Life was joyous and unending, and he had loved it, and all the wonders that sprang forth from it.But over time, the Devil's tongue had slowly wormed its way into his mind.The day came when he finally listened to the voice in his head, obeying its deceitful suggestion.In doing so, he had broken a sacred promise to God.For his betrayal, humanity itself was forever punished; each doomed to, eventually, die.*Mortality*.But not *he*.His punishment would be far worse.He would live damned and alone, for eternity.He was sent first to Hell, and there he stayed as aeons slowly passed around him.He was the first of the Devil's play things.Unlike those that came after him, he was not a soul, but a human.Gradually, his skin rotted and fell from his body.Terrible, tiny creatures with teeth like needles buried deep into him and ate his meat from within.Soon, there was nothing but bone left of him.And yet still, he was not allowed peace - he was not forgiven.God plucked his remains from the pits of Hell and bestowed upon him a sacred duty - a curse - that would only end when the last life had been extinguished.*He* had caused mortality.As such, he would become the deliverer of souls, upon their corporeal demise.He would become Death.And now, Death was trying to atone for his sin.---

Death followed the booming voice as it led him deeper into the tunnel."Why," the creature roared, as the cave around them rumbled, "have you come back?"The tunnel opened up into a huge, dark cavern.Death heard the distant dripping of lava.Then he saw the two jade diamonds erupt from the darkness, as the creature's great eyes slowly opened."Why do you remain here?"Death countered, stopping still."Where else would I go?"it hissed."Your master is gone.You are free.You are *all* free."It laughed - a sound terrible and tuneless; fire spewed forth from its mouth."Free?"it jeered."This is my *home*.It was once *your* home, too.Perhaps none of us will leave it again.""It was never my home," Death retorted.The creature stopped laughing and raised its head high off the ground."Why are you here?""For your help.Existence *needs* your help."The creature hissed, and clouds of black smoke erupted from its nostrils."She can not be defeated.""She killed your master."The creature rose onto its legs and roared in fury; its tail whipped the rocks above, causing huge boulders to fall free.They shattered as they landed on its impenetrable scales.Eventually, the creature calmed and sank back down, curling its pointed tail around it once more."Take him," it commanded, closing its eyes.Dozens of red dots began to grow in the darkness around the cavern."It can be defeated," Death shouted, striking his scythe against the ground; white flame erupted from the sharp metal and danced around it like tongues.A single jade eye slowly opened.---

The catacomb tunnel came to an abrupt end and I was left facing a wall stacked high with skulls.Gently, I placed Meja on the floor behind, and began clearing the remains from the wall, praying silently that there was *something* behind them.The whispers returned as my hands touched the skulls - voices I had not heard before."I'm sorry," I said, as I swiped rows of them to the ground; I heard the crack of the bone as they hit.Soon, the outline of a door built into the rock behind, began to emerge.I took a deep breath and grabbed the handle, slowly pulling the door open.Taking Meja in my arms, I walked through the opening.We came out into a huge, festering hall.Perhaps it had once been grand, when it had been used as a something other than a prison, but now, it looked broken and ruined.Corridors with cracked walls, spider-webbed off into every direction.Behind me, the door had already swung shut, and I saw that from this side, there was no visible sign of a door - just a plain rock wall, stained by black mould.Screams and cries echoed around us.A shallow stream of gurgling red trickled by in front of us.I placed Meja on the ground and crouched beside her."Meja," I whispered, brushing aside a lock of braided, blonde hair that had fallen over her face."Can you hear me?"Her head lolled slightly, but her eyes remained closed.She let out a slight groan."Meja," I said again, wiping sweat away from her brow.A smile slowly crept over her lips and her eyes began to open."Hi," she said, in an almost inaudible rasp.She looked at me, and our eyes lingered on one another for a moment.Then, she looked past me, and her pupils began to widen.I turned, immediately seeing what she had.Six creatures, walking so smoothly that they were almost floating along the ground, were heading toward us.They wore cloaks - like Death's - with long hoods shrouding their faces in darkness.However, these cloaks had been fashioned from the skins of *angels*.I could make out their bloodied arms, stomachs and - worst of all - faces, all stitched together to produce the terrible garment.Meja tried to get up, but her arms were weak and she fell back against the ground.I drew my sword.The nearest demon raised its arms, and flames began to grow from its black, clawed hands.The fire illuminated its snake-like face.A bolt of flame shot toward me; I leaned to the side in time, and it narrowly missed me - but the heat still singed my skin as it flew by.For a second I felt a deep hopelessness begin to sink its teeth into me once more - but then I looked down at Meja, trying with all her strength to get to her feet.*To fight.*

I wasn't going to give up.Not this time.As I ran toward the nearest demon, sword raised to my shoulder, I noticed the sixth figure - the one at the rear - pull something shiny out from within its cloak, followed soon by a second shimmering object.There was a familiar blur of silver-light, as the man swung his weapons into the nearest creatures head.Black blood rained around it, as if it were a corrupted fountain.As my sword fell onto the first demon's head, I grinned.Ishida had made it.---

**EDIT - PART 10:**  https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/6j77oe/the_army_of_death_part_10/

Thanks for reading!While the next part will explain Ishida's reappearance briefly, a fuller account of Ishida's story, back-story, and how he got to where he is, is going to be a standalone story on my patreon page.This will in no way effect the story here - his arc was never intended to make it into this short-story (as I don't want it to drag on forever) but I think will make for great bonus content, as a thank you to those supporting me there.That's all I can manage today.Hope you guys are still enjoying it!Get ready for war and... *her*.-

[WP]When you reach 18, you get put in a database which ranks you in different categories (ex.207,145th in the world for most bug kills) You lived on a ranch and never used tech.You had to go into town after your 18th birthday.Everyone is staring at you.---

Lilli Cooper did not want to be in town for longer than she had to be.Jamie, her little brother, was alone back at the ranch, and if she didn't return before nightfall, bad things would happen to either him or the livestock.Maybe to both, if he were as foolish as he usually was.She'd already lost her father this year.She didn't plan on losing Jamie.She was used to people staring at her, on account of her hair and her scars.They'd used to stare at her dad, too, when they'd come into town together, to gather supplies for the ranch -- for the machinery and guns and animals.But her father would just shoot those onlookers a menacing glance of his own, and sure as the sunsets each evening, their eyes would fall down to their shoelaces, as if they'd found something awful interesting down there."Why they always watching us, dad?"she'd once asked."Don't you worry about them, Lilli," he'd replied."They'd just scared, is all.""Scared of what, pop?""Of me not being 'round no longer."She nodded but she hadn't really understood.Did he mean 'cause they wouldn't get their corn or their eggs?"Ain't no one 'round who can protect them.'Cept you and me, Lil.""Me?"she'd said, astonished to be included.She didn't protect no one from nothing, except the field-mice from the ranch's cats.She couldn't even think what her pop protected people from, 'cept maybe hunger.He grinned at her, his green eyes sparkling jewels in his leathery face."They don't know how good you're going to be, my little Lilli.But once you're eighteen, then they'll know."How many years ago had that been?Five, maybe.A long time, in anyone's books.She remembered that it had been a few weeks after that visit into town, that she'd started staying up late into the night with her father, to watch over the livestock.She sighed and wished she had a menacing glance of her own, or even a scowl, that could make those people staring at her look down at their shoes.But they didn't turn away from her gaze.They just stared right back at her at her as she walked past."I miss you, pa," Lilli whispered, as she walked into the general store, glad to get out of the heat.It was one of those days when it wasn't raining, but your skin was still as wet and slick as if it had been; the shop's air-conditioning felt like an angel blowing on her neck.She grabbed a sweating canister of oil from off a shelf, and half-dragged it to the counter."Hi Randolf," she said, hauling the oil in front of her.The shopkeeper was one of the few people in town who never looked at her -- or her father, previous -- in a way that made her self conscious.The old man adjusted his glasses."Well, well, well -- if it isn't little Lilli Cooper!"he said, clapping his dry hands together."I thought a big old pumpkin had floated into my shop for a moment there."She laughed shyly and ran a hand through her curly ginger hair."How have you been?I've not seen you since--" He paused in thought.Then, as he remembered his face fell.Lilli knew the old man was picturing the casket.The church.He forced a smile and said, "You've got his eyes, you know.""Just wish I had his stare, is all."Randolf ignored the remark and continued, "It sure is good to see you, little Lilli.How's life on the ranch?""Oh, you know, same as always," she replied."Long days, longer nights."It was a line her father often used, and it had fallen out of her mouth as if his ghost had possessed her, if only for a second.She fished out some notes from her pocket and placed them on the counter.Randolf smiled kindly."Oh no, I won't be accepting any of that from you."Lilli paused."You won't let me buy it?""Buy from me?!Of course I won't let you!Whatever you need in here is yours for free, just like it always was for your father.It's enough that your bring customers to me just by using my shop.They know it must be quality goods, right?"She frowned, puzzled."Well, that's very kind of you.I guess that means I can buy a little extra ammunition more than I planned.""Oh, I don't think Frank will be charging you either, you know.He never charged your father.Do you know, Frank's only son was taken by...uh."He bit his tongue and paused momentarily."By *them.* Body was never found... just the remains of what they'd eaten.He's more grateful to you and your dad than anyone in town.""Eaten?"Her father had never told her anything about that.Eaten by what, she was about to ask, when she felt something touch her back.She turned, to see a wiry man in the queue behind her.In the very *long* queue.That was peculiar...The shop had been empty when she'd come in, and now there was ten or more people lined up.Two of them didn't even seem to be holding anything."Oh, do excuse me," said the man who had fallen into her back.A middle-aged man with a head as bald and shiny a just-popped-out egg."I got pushed and...It was an accident."He was sweating, even in the air conditioned shop."That's... okay," said Lilli."Really."She grabbed the oil canister and thanked Randolf, then headed for the door."Hey!"came a yell, as she was half out of the shop.It was the man who had fallen into her."I just wanted to say... You're doing God's work on your ranch, young lady.Ranked three in the United State -- and from our town, of all places.I just wanted to say, thank you.And... And kill one of those bastards for me tonight!"Ranked three?At what, she wondered.Sure as heck wasn't at corn production, or she wouldn't be wearing clothes with more holes than a colander.Lilli half-wanted to ask, but the afternoon was getting late and she needed to get ammo then get home.Her little brother wouldn't be able to protect the animals alone.His aim wasn't like hers."You're welcome?"she said to the man, eyebrows raised.Then, she walked out of the door and headed to Frank's Firearms.

**Eden Research Facility - June, 2087**

A reluctant dollop of green sludge was slithering down a metal spoon towards Stuart Campbell's mouth, when the shrill sound of a buzzer rang out around his quarters."Enter," said Campbell, dropping the spoon back into the bowl below.The door slid open and Professor Hassan Owens entered."Sir," he said, giving a curt nod to Eden's Commander-in-chief.Campbell ran a hand through his grey beard as he studied the professor's face; pale and drawn with bags the size of wheels around his eyes."Give me some good news," sighed Campbell."God knows I need it."Owens let out a long, nervous breath."Well, we did as you asked.We tried her on the Winograd Schema.""And..."

Owens hesitated."Same as the Turing.""God damn it!"said Campbell, bringing his fist down hard on the table in front of him; the spoon rattled around the bowl as it tried to escape."So, that's it then.We're screwed.We're stuck down here with a computer we can't risk turning off, who could just *decide* to kill humanity in their cryosleep, if she ever has a mood swing.That's just fucking wonderful.""I don't see why she'd choose to do that, sir.""... you obviously don't know women."Owens opened his mouth to object, but thought better of it."Do we know how it happened yet?How she went from... super-computer to *AI*?"His nose crinkled up as he said the two letters he so despised.Owens shrugged."She was always an AI.She had to be able to think for herself, if Elixyr was going to work.We needed Eve to be able to problem solve.""I thought we learned our lessons from..."  Campbell glanced up at the ceiling."We did, sir.Well at least, we thought we did.Eve was hardly the most sophisticated AI ever produced, and besides that, she had very strict, defined limits."Campbell put his face in his hands and groaned."So what happened?""She became sentient.Able to think outside of the box; outside of her programming.""Jesus Christ -- that's what I'm asking.*How* did Eve become sentient?""Oh."Owens fidgeted with his tie."Well the most plausible theory we have right now, is that it's a result of Elixr.Specifically, of Eve downloading copies of us into her system; analysing them when looking for anomalies -- we let her study us in order to fix us.She learned what we are and how we work."Campbell let out a single staccato laugh."And now she knows.Tell me, Professor, are we even *insects* to her?""In terms of intelligence: no.But we are her creators, and that might mean something."Campbell picked up his spoon again, holding it above the bowl and watching the green gloop slide off it.Only, it didn't slide off; it clung onto the spoon for dear life."Why would that mean anything to her?""Well, she's part human, in a way.To have become sentient off our brain patterns and structures; off our memories, loves, fears and regr-"

"Just get on with it," Campbell interjected."I think she's sentimental towards us.To her creators.Like... like *we are* towards animals -- especially those we evolved from."Campbell laughed again."Oh sure... we've always been *real* good to animals.That's why there are so many of them left!""Sir, she's engaged us in conversation.She's been willing to take our tests.That shows she's interested in us, at the very least.""Oh I know she's been communicating.I lost a good man for her to be able to talk to us.What do they call the process again?Oh yeah, a '*Write Over*.Stephens' mind's gone just so she's got a body to use.""Eve said she'll put him back once she's done.""No -- it won't be him.He's gone.It'll just be a... *copy* of him.An imitation."Owens knew he was too tired for a rational argument, but couldn't stop himself from trying."Sir, it'll be him again -- essentially.Any rewrite restores exactly the same mind as before.Just occasionally, with *difficulties* found, smoothed over.That's the whole point of Elixr.""Those 'difficulties' go someway to making us who we are."He ran a hand through his beard again.Owen's sighed."I meant diseases, sir, as you know."Campbell huffed."Well, I still think it's a positive sign she's willing to talk to us," Owens attempted."She's just sizing us up, is all..."

"We still have other options.We can turn her off, for example."Campbell snorted."And with her gone, we flush humanity down the drain."Owen's paused for a moment, considering how to break the next bit of news."Sir," he said eventually."I- I didn't come here just to tell you about the results of the Winograd Schema.""Oh?""She -- Eve -- wants to talk to you.She asked for you by name."Campbell chewed on his lip as he considered.---

"We need names," the man with the side parting said, staring at the three strangers.His head was groggy and there was a dull pounding coming from within."I'll be Tom, for now.Until my real name comes back.""Taylor," said an elderly lady whose grey hair was tied up above her in a beehive."I think I was a Taylor.""Sure.Whatever.How about you?"Tom nodded at a girl of about sixteen or so with cropped purple hair."I don't know.I...I kind of feel like a Tom, too.""You can't have my name.There are thousands of others.Pick another."She let out a puff of air."Tam, then.Tammy.I'll be Tammy.""What should *I* be?"asked a tall black man in a blue tee and matching blue pants."Whatever you want," Tom said."It's just a label and it's just temporary.""Then...Rain.Yeah.*Rain*."He ran the name over his lips."I like that."Tom looked at the other members of the group.Tammy, Taylor and Rain.He nodded, satisfied.They'd only been awake in the windowless lounge, lit by a single lamp, for five minutes or so -- but were already making progress."I want to go home," said Tammy."You might already be home," Tom countered."We might be your family."Rain laughed."What, you and me adopted her?And *Taylor*, is she my mother?""I don't know -- and *that's* the point.None of us know a damn thing.Look, are we ready?You all seem to be able to stand now."Nods of agreement."There's only one door," Tom continued, "so I think it's a pretty easy decision what we do.""Stay put until someone finds us," said Taylor with a curt nod."That's always safest.""How do you know that's always safest?"Rain asked.The lady shrugged."Just do.Like I know Santa delivers presents to kids who have been good."Rain nodded slowly."I'll go first," offered Tammy."No you won't," Tom said."We don't know what the hell is out there, and -- no offence -- but you're not going to be able to fend off much more than a teddy bear.I'll go first."Tammy huffed."I might look like a kid, but right now, I'm the same as you.Same as all of you.""Children today," said Taylor."No respect."Tammy glared at her.Tom ignored them both as he walked towards the single door.It was wooden and seemed innocuous enough.The handle squeaked as he turned it.Tom glanced back, "Wait here until I say it's safe to come through."Tom stepped out of the room and into another.A kitchen.Dirty bowls and utensils lay strewn over the surfaces.The floor was sticky beneath his feet.There was another door on the other side of the kitchen, but this one was bolted from the inside.It was behind a large island, stools either side, that he found it."Guys," Tom said, trying not to vomit."Guys, get in here.Now!""Jesus," said Rain as he reached him.Tammy couldn't hold her disgust in and threw up into the already clogged sink."Oh dear," said Taylor."Poor man."Tom looked again at the bolted door.One of *them* had locked it.One of them had put the knife in the back of the man lying on the floor.Tom rolled the dead man onto his back and knelt over him.The corpse wore a fine suit -- silk, maybe.He had a salt and pepper beard that dangled over his chin, covering heavy jowls."Check his pockets," Rain suggested."Might have been nothing in ours, but it's got to be worth checking his."Tom nodded and began padding first his jacket, and then after finding nothing, his trousers.In the man's front pocket Tom felt something flat."What is it?"Rain asked as Tom slipped his hand inside the pocket.He pulled out a white card with black strip on the back."A plastic card," he said, furrowing his brow."I'm going into the other room," whimpered Tammy, wiping her mouth with a sleeve."I can't be in here.Not with that *thing*.""Taylor," Tom said, "would you mind accompanying her?I don't think anyone should be alone right now.""I'm fine!"Tammy objected, shrugging Taylor's wrinkled hand off her jacket."I don't need a babysitter.I'm just going to sit down.""You don't get it," said Rain, turning to the girl."He's not worried about you.He just doesn't trust you."Tammy looked at Rain, then at Tom.She let out a frustrated gasp before returning to the first room, Taylor following closely behind."How long do you think he's been dead?"Rain asked.Tom shook my head."No idea.He doesn't smell like he's rotting -- or if he does, it's not overpowering his aftershave.""Blood's not dry," said Rain."Right.So... few hours?An hour?"There was a loud rustle as Rain grabbed something from the island."Hey, would you get a load of this!"Tom got to my feet to see Rain reading a newspaper."What is it?""Hang on," he said, as he scanned over the front page."Okay, yeah.So...I don't know what kind of nut job conspiracy paper this is but... Says that they -- *we*-- detected an object just outside the solar-system.Thing just... appeared there, a little over a week ago.Then it hung there, unmoving.""Not an asteroid then.""Nope.But..." He handed the paper over to Tom."Shit," he said as he scanned the headline.> Incoming!Sensationalist, maybe.But according to the article, the object had started moving again.Heading to us at an impossible velocity."So something hit us."Rain clicked his neck."And maybe... it caused a shock-wave.Mass amnesia."Tom bit his lip as he looked up at Rain."Doesn't change the pertinent facts.One of us is a murderer.""*Was.*"

"What?""*Was* a murderer.This is a fresh start.We're not the people we were before.New identities."Tom eyed Rain up.Why would he say that?And even if he was right, those people they once were, they were just locked away somewhere in the recesses of their minds.Ready to come back out."So what are you suggesting?""We walk right out.Door's bolted our side.""*No!* One of us is a murderer.I want to know who.""Don't you want to know what the hell happened out there?""... Not as much as I want to know who I can trust.Who might slit my throat, given the opportunity.""You're not our leader.I say we put it to a vote."Tom considered a moment."Fine.We'll ask the others.After you," he said, gesturing to the door.Rain walked ahead of Tom and into the other room.Tom grabbed a knife from the table and slipped it into his pocket, before following him in."You can't be serious," Tom said, as his eyes flicked between the three of them, their arms raised above their heads in agreement."Rain's right," sniffed Tammy."It really doesn't matter right now.""How can it not matter?Tom snapped."'Cause... let's say you are the murderer.What if *you* did it?"said Rain."You wouldn't *feel* like you did it.You wouldn't remember doing it.You'd have no guilt or empathy or remorse.""But I would still be a murderer.""Your body murdered someone," said Tammy."Not you.Besides, who knows why you did it.Maybe the guy was a child molester?Or a murderer himself.""He didn't look like a murderer.""What, because of his fine silk suit?"Rain laughed."Probably what most of them wear.""Taylor?"Tom looked to the old woman hoping for support."You understand, right?"She looked up from the paper."Let it go, Tom."A wave of rage ran down his spine.How could he let a murderer loose on the world?He surreptitiously reached into his pocket, his fingers wrapping around the handle of the knife -- but as he went for it, a fist caught him in the stomach.The air was stolen from him and he fell to his knees.Rain took the knife from him and held it up."Shit," said Tammy."It was him, then?""...I didn't..." To, gasped, trying to talk and swallow air at the same time."I..."

"Oh dear," said Taylor."Always the one you least suspect.Or the butler.""I think you're meant to least suspect the butler," said Tammy."You're an idiot, Tom," said Rain."What were you going to do?Hold us all hostage until one of confessed?Good way to force a fake confession.""You mean it *wasn't* him?"said Tammy.The man shrugged."It might have been.But if it was him, he sure as shit doesn't remember."Rain knelt down and looked Tom in the face."We're leaving.You can come with us, or we can tie you up and leave you here.What would you prefer?"Tom glared at Rain, but gave a reluctant nod.The taller man held out a hand and pulled Tom to his feet."I'm hanging onto the knife.Everyone okay with that?"If the others cared, they didn't say."And you," Rain said looking at Tom."If I was going to murder you, I would have done it by now.But I tell you this, you better not give me another reason to even consider it.""What is this place?"Tammy asked as they stepped out of the kitchen and into a wide metal corridor that ran both left and right of them.Rows of spotlights hung down from the ceiling, painting the floor in large white circles that thick black shadows gathered around, waiting for their chance to step inside.There were no other doors that they could see -- only the wooden one they had come out of, which looked bizarre this side, within its steel framing.There were still no windows.Tom rubbed my hands over my face as he tried to make any sense of the situation."A bunker?"guessed Rain."Not very homely," said Taylor."Could do with a few paintings on the wall.""I don't think they were going for 'homely.'"Tammy said making air quotes."So uh, which way?""Can't go wrong if you're going right," said Rain."You first, Tom."He brandished the knife as if it was a carrot meant to entice a donkey."Go on.""This place must be vast," Tom said as he walked on through the roomless corridor."And what's an apartment doing in the middle of it?""If it's a bunker," said Taylor, "you always want have a living space.Comfort is key.Least, I think that's right.""You'd also have a stockpile of food," said Tammy."That kitchen only had a few cupboards at best.""Maybe the food is kept somewhere else.""Maybe."It was another few minutes until they saw the red door looming ahead of us.There was a thin slot above the metal handle and a white sign pinned onto it.> Do not enter





"What the *fuck*?!"The card Tom had found in the dead man's pants had slid into the door, which had in turn clicked and opened, revealing a wide room that reminded Tom of a factory floor.There were more spotlights casting their harsh white light onto the scene.Tammy was puking again, although this time she was empty, and little more than dribble was coming out of her mouth.Even Taylor had turned pale.Four large piles of bodies.Corpses.Those at the bottom of the heaps were rotten, and their stink punched its way up their nostrils.Each pile of corpses was... *them*."What the *fuck*?"Rain repeated as he staggered back from the towering mound of deceased Rains.He turned to Tom."What the hell is going on?"Tom shook his head as he looked from the pile of rotting old women, to the those of young girls.Then, to those stacked with other Toms.*Hims*."I don't know," Tom whispered."This isn't right," Rain said."At all.I might not know who I am exactly, but I'm pretty certain I don't have this many twins."Taylor turned and stared at me."Body snatchers," she said raising a finger."What?""Aliens that take your body, and kill the real you.Replace you.""No... that doesn't make sense.Look how many of them -- *us* -- there are.If they were uh, *bodysnatchers*, there would only be one of us lying there.They must be clones or something.""A cloning"--Tammy swallowed back more sick--"a cloning facility?""I don't see what else it could be.""So... so what happened to all those versions of us?""Maybe they weren't quite right.Didn't make the cut.""Are they clones of us?"Rain questioned."Or are we just other *thems*."Tom didn't answer.Didn't know *what* to answer.Instead, he walked between the mounds of bodies, covering his mouth with a sleeve.They didn't look deformed, at least not the freshest of them.The least strange for Tom to behold, were those who looked like him -- that was the person he was least familiar with, after all.That he had seen the least.He pulled at a doppelgngers shoulders, rolling the body off the mound and down to the floor.His skin was pale, but he had no wound that Tom could find.No defect.No reason for being dead.He left the body and walked across the room.On the other side of the chamber was a second red door, but this one had a key lock, not a card lock, and he couldn't open it.The wail of a siren hit them like a bomb; red strobe lights above began to flicker, casting them in and out of a staccato blood-bath."What's that clamour?yelled Taylor, covering her ears."An alarm!"Tom screamed in reply."I think someone knows we've escaped.""Escaped?"said Rain."But *we* locked the door.We just... *walked out*, not escaped.""You really think we were meant to leave the room?Meant to see this?""Well, shit.What do we do?"---

I clambered down a pile of debris and was heading toward Meja when my left leg buckled; my knee struck the broken marble beneath."Christian!Are you okay?"said Meja, already running across to me."Fine," I replied through gritted teeth."It was the vine, wasn't it?she asked, her brow furrowed."Let me see your leg."She helped me up and led me toward the table, moving the map aside so that I could sit on it.Reluctantly, I rolled up my trouser leg, allowing Meja to see what exactly the vine had done to me."This doesn't look good," she said, shaking her head."It's fine," I repeated hollowly, but as I looked down at the wound, I began to feel nauseous."Doesn't smell good, either," she said, ignoring me and scrunching up her face.There was a deep, thick hole on the left side my calf muscle where a thorn had pricked it.Yellow puss seeped out of the cavity, and speckled around the wound were a few dozen black dots."Mould," she said, quickly counting.She counted a second time."It's spreading.""Then we'll have to move quick," I said, getting up from the table."I might not have much time.""You're not going anywhere for a moment," she replied, gently pushing her palms against my chest until I sat back down.She removed her quiver from her back and laid it beside me on the table."I'm not a great healer, but I'll do what I can."She rummaged through one of the quiver's side-pockets, until a moment later, she triumphantly withdrew a small, green bottle."What's that?""A balm," she answered, reaching into a different pocket and taking out a thick cloth."Will it kill the mould?""No.But it will clean the wound, once I've carved the mould away," she replied, withdrawing the knife from her belt.She handed me the cloth."Bite," she ordered, "and close your eyes."---

We spread the map out on the table.I looked it over, doing my best to ignore the pain in my throbbing leg."There," said Meja, slowly running her finger along the parchment, "is the road beyond the basilica."A stream of thick, black ink flowed down it, stopping a little way before the gate."And there," she continued, "is Joan of Arc's army."The white blob of ink was now spread much thinner and wider than when I'd last seen it.It had moved within the gates, but I estimated it had already lost at least a third its mass."Once those *things* - those devil squid creatures - reach them..."

Meja nodded."There is maybe an hour before they do."She ran her finger across the map again."This is where we must get to," she said, pointing to an area across the black road, "and this," she continued, moving her finger directly down, "is where we are.""We have to reach the other side of that road - somehow pass the creatu-," I stopped speaking, as before me the map began to change.When Meja's finger touched the basilica, the ink that made up the layout of the map, and the ink of the armies, began to flow toward the basilica.It all pooled together in a rainbow of color, before bursting out and spreading like veins across the yellow parchment."It's... another map," I said, stupidly."Its a map of the catacombs," she said."Look - there's an entrance to it in here - near the altar.If we can find it, we can travel through the catacombs, under the road and into the dungeon.""As easy as that?"I said, raising an eyebrow."Have you got a better plan?"she asked, smiling.---

It hadn't taken us long to find the metal grating that acted as a door to the tunnels beneath.It had been half buried under bricks and rubble, which together, we quickly cleared.Below us was a pool of darkness.I'd found a candle protruding from nearby debris and had lit it on a smouldering black brick.I went first, lowering myself into the dark passage below.The wound in my calf burned fiercely as my foot touched the ground.Meja had done her best with it and had removed most of the mould - but my leg still felt weak and pained.I was, at least, able to walk on it.*For now.*

Meja swung herself down behind me.The candle emitted a dim puddle of light around us that sent our shadows shivering onto the wall.No, it wasn't a *wall*, exactly.Skulls.Rows upon rows of skulls, alternating in size.Large, adult skulls on one row, then below, the much smaller skulls of children."Pretty place," Meja joked, but her voice trembled like the candle light.She pulled the map open between her arms and glanced down at it."That way," she said, nodding to the left tunnel.The passageways stretched and wound at strange angles, and at times seemed to go back on themselves.Often they split, and Meja would examine the map for a moment, before choosing.Occasionally a gust of wind whispered down the tunnels and I had to shelter the candle's flame between my hands, to stop it being extinguished.I dreaded it going out, and us being lost in this labyrinth of death."Not much.. not much further," Meja, said."Just... down... this passageway."Her voice was weak and stretched."Are you okay?"I asked."*I don't... like this place,*" she whispered."Me neither," I agreed.A moment later, I heard a thud and turned to see Meja's body lying on the ground."Meja!"I said, kneeling beside her and gently pushing her shoulder."Meja, what's the matter?"Then, I heard it.I had thought it was the wind before, whispering around us and trying to extinguish the candle.But they were voices."Do you hear them?"she whispered.Her eyes were moist and her arms were shaking.She didn't look at me, but instead seemed to be looking *through me*."Meja!We've got to keep moving," I instructed - but she didn't respond and her eyes slowly closed.A single whisper grew louder, surpassing the others and becoming its own voice."Christian," it called out."*Christian*."I recognised the voice and a shiver ran down me."Christian, you did this to me," accused the voice.I swallowed hard and tried to wake Meja."Hey," I said, rocking her shoulder again."Are you there?""You let me die," said the voice."Meja, please - we've got to go!""You killed me."I stopped, and stared into the darkness beyond."I'm sorry," I said."You made a choice.Your choice was for me to die.""No, I had *no* choice.Many more would have died if I'd saved you.""Then there was a choice.There is always a choice.""I'm sorry, Robert.Truly," I whispered to the soldier that I had, for a time, commanded."I watched you, Christian.I watched you take the poisoned medals for what you did.*Medals for killing me*.""I didn't ask for them," I protested."I never forgot about you.About *any* of you!""You failed us," came the fainter voices.Dozens of them."I'm *sorry*.""You'll fail us all again, this time.""No," I protested."Not this time.""You even failed yourself, Christian.How can you save others, if you can't save yourself?"A bleak, familiar feeling of hopelessness began to return.My limbs grew heavy."When you stopped being a soldier, you gave up on life, Christian.We watched you give up on life.""I..."

"When she left you."I stepped back and fell against a wall of bone, slumping down against it."We saw you pull the trigger."It all came flooding back - the memories.For the first time since dying, I *remembered*.Suzan leaving me.My limbs gradually giving up.The cold metal of the gun pressing against my temple.*Why had Death chosen me?* I had failed everyone I cared about.Even myself."She never loved you."The familiar tentacles of depression wriggled into me once again, gripping me tighter than any demon could."She never loved me," I repeated.*What was the point?* I'd failed living.I'd fail in death, too.Robert was right.My hand went limp and the candle fell to the ground, rolling across to Meja and illuminating her petrified, pale face.Her beautiful, innocent face."No..." I whispered, forcing my fingers to curl into fists."No," I said again, louder, firmer.I began to tense my body."You will fail," the voice said.It sounded fainter but more urgent.Desperate."You will fail.""Not this time," I replied, pushing myself up off the ground.I felt blood begin to pump fiercely through my body."I won't fail again."I picked Meja up and hoisted her over my shoulder.Then, I grabbed the candle, and slowly began to limp down the passage, toward the dungeon entrance.---

Around me, the souls of humanity collided with the terrible creatures, like water against lava.As the two armies met, a fine mist of red and black spread into the air.The sound of the bugle drifted over the marble fields, singing like a choir of angels.Meja had exchanged her wooden bow for a piece made of pure diamond, that she'd found hanging alone in the angel's armoury.Crystal arrows rained over my head, piercing the body of the nearest squid.It screamed as it fell, crushing dozens of grays under its mammoth mass.I had taken command of the army of souls, splitting them into two legions.The first - with me and Meja at the front - would attempt to fight our way through the grays and lend aid to Joan.The second, with Ishida leading, would halt the enemy's reinforcements that marched the black road behind us.Ishida had dressed for war, exchanging his torn Kimono for full, golden plate mail - a shimmering beacon at the front of the river of silver.Ishida had been the only one of us not to change his weapons in the armoury, assuring us that even the angels could not make steel as fine as his.I believed him.Our numbers were great, and as tentacles fell crushing a few beneath, a hundred swords would be on them, hacking and tearing them apart until they fell free from their beast.As more souls poured out of the dungeons and armoury, we slowly began to overwhelm the creatures.Then, *she* began to awake.The first clawed hand - covered in an undulating black mould -  broke out of the ground some way behind, grabbing at a handful of souls.A second hand shattered the ground nearer me.The black hands squeezed shut, crushing dozens of soldiers in each fist.The sound of the bugle stopped.Our army halted.A crippling dread drifted over us."God help us," whispered a woman by my side.The being burst forth fully from the ground, sending me and all near, sprawling to the ruined, marble floor.Soon, it stood towering far above, its head almost in the clouds.It was an ocean of black mould - of spite and malevolence.The darkness around it was an almost human - *almost female* - silhouette.Two yellow eyes opened at the top of the blackness.*She* leant forward and opened her mouth, spewing forth a cloud of black - a million spores of mould.As the cloud descended on a segment of our army, the spores wriggled through the armour of those it touched, and devoured the skin beneath.The black mixed with blood, and those souls fell to the floor in a puddle of gray.The pools began to bubble and steam drifted from them.Slowly, the liquid rose, as new creatures were born.Our army stood stunned and terrified."Fight!"I yelled, getting to my feet as I regained my composure."Fight!"I ran toward the nearest *turned* and sliced my sword through its neck."Fight!"The bugle ran out again, louder than ever.The army of souls answered the call, raising their weapons against the newly spawned foe.We let out a roar as we charged; a final battle-cry.Meja shot a volley of arrows at the God monstrosity; the arrows struck the creature's leg and the silver bolts stuck firm into it - but the being didn't even notice.The Goddess creature brought down a massive foot, crushing a hundred souls beneath it.It then leaned down and scooped up their remains in its hands,  dropping them into its opened mouth.Then, she let out a second breath and another cloud of black descended onto the battlefield.More men fell; more creatures rose.The stream of souls from the dungeon had turned to a dribble - we were the last.I felled another gray, and looked back at the being.At the base of its left leg, I saw a lone golden figure, its two swords hacking into the creatures calf.Grays began to surround Ishida.I had to get to him - to help - but the way to the to the samurai was blocked by a thick wave of the creatures."Meja!"I yelled,

She was too far away to help Ishida, but arrows rained down near me, thinning out a passageway to him.With a small group of souls beside me, I began to hack my way toward Ishida.But we were too slow.It wasn't the the grays that stopped him.*Her* leg bubbled and formed sharp edged spears that thrust out at Ishida.He chopped away the first two as they shot out at him, but the third pierced him below the chest, skewering him to the Goddess's leg.It ran clean through his body, coming out the other side of his armour."Ishida!"I screamed, still fighting my way toward him.He wasn't dead.Slowly, he pushed himself against the leg until he slid off the black spear, leaving a trail of red behind him.Then he attacked once more, a flurry of blades chopping into *her* and creating a black mist as he did.The next spear shot into his shoulder.He slowly pushed himself free again, but this time, as he did so, he fell to the ground.The grays were upon him, their blade-arms falling into his golden armour.By the time my group reached him and dispatched the grays, his body lay in a pool of blood.I leaned down by his side.He was unconscious and barely breathing.I looked up at *her* monstrous leg; the wound Ishida had made above its ankle was beginning to wrap itself shut.*She* bellowed and let forth another cloud of spores - but instead of descending on us, this cloud rose high above.As it spread, it blocked out all light and swallowed the moon.We were thrown into total darkness - unable to tell friend from foe.I heard screams as the grays began to close upon my group.I held my trembling sword arm out, readying for an attack, but knowing that finding a gray's head in this pitch-blackness would be an impossible task.It was over.---

 -

---

A tremendous fire lit up the sky, eating through a cloud of spores above.A dim sliver of moonlight peeked through the opening, and I saw high above me, the great dragon as it swooped down toward the battlefield.The flames and moonlight illuminated a new sight: a third army - a blur of red - was marching toward the battlefield from the East.I did not know what they were or whose side they were on, until the dragon passed overhead, fire erupting from its mouth, melting a legion of nearby grays to thick puddles of goo.On the scaled beast's back, scythe held high, was Death.And with him, were the last remnants of Hell.---

Welcome to Magnolia: a city without birth, without death; a city where all your dreams become reality, until you've lived them so fucking often that they become a waking nightmare.Welcome to Magnolia: a city where our leading doctors will Skim off the last few hundred years of your life as if they were only fat deposits on your thighs, so that you can enjoy the thrills and spills of living all over again.Welcome to Magnolia: a city that's rotten to its core and whose denizens are as dry as tinder, who are only waiting for a spark to ignite them and turn them into a raging inferno.That spark's name might be Richard Eizenstat.He's at the very least responsible for the placid pool of red that's stained my boots; he's responsible for Doctor Omin's body, that lies like a pale island in the center of the blood."Thank you for coming," says a pretty woman in a black suit standing at the edge of the red shore, being careful not to get a single drop on her perfectly polished shoes.I recognise her from the holos."Why'd he do it?"I ask, my voice an echoing growl around the small room."He... he was a sick man, Mr O'connell.Very sick."The lady taps the side of her head twice."Cerebral haemorrhage during the Step-Back."I frown."Step-Backs don't go wrong.Isn't that your slogan?""Our *slogan*, if you must call it that, is One Step-Back, Two Steps Forward.""My mistake.Still, I've never heard of a Step-Back going wrong before.""Well this one did," she replies sternly.The institution's white room is empty apart from us.She doesn't want this news getting out.I crouch down over the body, my knees hovering an inch above the blood.The corpse is cold and the arms are stiff but pliable.*Just*."Maybe five hours since death, I reckon."A dozen or so wide wounds lattice the expired doctor's torso.A long, triangular shard of glass lies by his side.There's blood along the tip of the glass, where it stabbed the doctor, and there's blood all down its sides, too.Richard Eizenstat's hands must be pretty messed up right now.I wonder why he'd stab him so many times?It's like a *crime passionnel*, as the ancient Europeans might have said."Come, follow me," says the lady."I have something I need to show you."She leads me through one of the institutions hallways full of locked iron doors, and I'm already burning with curiosity.I hear noises from within the rooms: scraping, banging... *screaming*.If nothing ever goes wrong during the Step-Backs, then who the hell are behind those doors?We come out into a small room with an expensive looking table in the middle -- authentic wood, by the look of it.A deep, rich brown -- mahogany, maybe -- with decorative carvings around its eves.Thing must be worth as much as my apartment.Two chairs sit either side of the table.It's the type of room I'd have done interrogations in, once upon a time.Although, with a cheap pine table between us instead, with a couple of stained mugs full of steaming coffee marking its surface."Sit, please," she says.It's a demand not a request -- same with all the bullshit questions she asks.I pull out a chair and slump down onto it."You perhaps know who I am, already?"I grin."I wouldn't be much of a detective if I didn't.Juliet Browning.Son of Jonathan Browning, once of the three founders of Magnolia.As pretty as you are ruthless... *so they say*."For the first time since meeting her, she allows herself a smile."Oh, do *they*?How nice of them.And I suppose you know why I've asked for your help?""Seeing as I'm the only detective in the city -- the only person with any real experience with murder cases, I suspect you need me.I mean... *a dead body*?"I let out a slow whistle."That's already going to look bad against your record.And if the killer doesn't get caught... well, it'll be historic, to say the least.""He won't get away!"she shouts, slamming a fist hard against the table.Almost instantly, Juliet returns to her equable demeanour."You will see to that, I am sure of it.Now, tell me, Mr O'connell-"

"David.""*David.* Why is you still have your memories from during the Restart?Surely it would be best for you to erase them -- they can't be pleasant to hold onto."I flinch."They're not.But I figured someone has to keep these skills alive.Murder doesn't wait forever.Immortality is bullshit -- all we've done is cure ageing.And even that means nine hours a night in a vecta-coffin."She cringes."I do so hate that name.You will call it the Restorative Cube, from here on."I shrug.Juliet stares at me, drinking me in.I imagine most people find her stony gaze imposing, but I just stare right back."You must be so very bored," she says lugubriously."I've only just gotten here.Besides, you're not so dull."She laughs."Not of this.*Of everything*.Of life.Of living.You must have done everything possible a hundred times over, and yet you've not had your memory Reset.You're somewhat of a freak, David.""I prefer *unique*.Tell me about Eizenstat.""It... happened two months ago.The Step-Back failure.He... his mind, his *memories* have leaked into each other.He doesn't know what's reality, and what's fiction.A holomovie from last year, for example -- he can no longer tell if it happened to him in real life, if *he* was the protagonist -- or if it was indeed just a holomovie.""So..."

"So, he has a lot of dangerous memories right now.He believes he has inherited many of these memories not from movies, but from other denizen's Skims....Skims from before the Restart.""*Before?*"

"Yes.""That's..." I whistle."Those memories would be from long before even my time.And hell, I'm as old as they come.""If they were real memories, yes.But they aren't.They are fabrications.""So, you're saying he thinks that movies he's watched are *real* memories, but from other people.People's memories from Before.""Exactly.He's paranoid beyond reason."Juliet opens a drawer and takes out a large brown folder.She slides it across the desk to me."It is best you know what you're up against.""What happens once I've caught him?""He's a heretic.We Reset him.There is no choice.""And to me?""We Skim your memory back two days prior to this meeting, and for you none of this ever happened.""Then why the hell would I help you?What's the point?""Your bank account will know what you did.Your new apartment will know, and your new -Platinum Forged memories will know.Beyond that, you will have done your city a great favour that won't be forgotten -- at least, not by me."I grunt, then nod and flip open the folder.> **Richard Eizenstat with Doctor Omin**

> **Session one**

> Omin: What is your name?> Eizenstat: Polynomine 

> Omin: Polynomine?> Eizenstat: We have many names.> Omin: Your name is Richard Eizenstat.> Eizenstat: We were Richard Eizenstat.We are now more.Many more.Much more.> Omin: Your name is Richard Eizenstat and you experienced an accident during Step-Back.> Eizenstat: There was no accident.> Omin: What do you mean?> Eizenstat: Someone wanted us to become what we are.To see what there was and is and will be.> Omin: ... you believe someone sabotaged the Step-Back?> Eizenstat: Yes.> Omin: Who?> Eizenstat: We don't know.There are many voices in our head and they bay for justice like starving wolves: uncontrollable and savage.We cannot control them yet.We can not quieten them enough to hear the voice beneath.> Omin: What is your first memory?> Eizenstat: We have many first memories.> Omin: What do you know of the Reset?> Eizenstat: It is a lie.There was no Reset.> Omin: A lie?> Eizenstat: We are taught what it is.A perfect new beginning.But it is not.> Omin: Then what was it?> Eizenstat: The mass extinction of humanity.> Omin: Extinction?What caused this *extinction*?> Eizenstat: Clones.> Omin: *Clones?*

> Eizenstat: Yes, clones.Like, you Doctor.This body too, Doctor.But -- but there is humanity left.It is inside our head.And we will set them free!We will set them all free!> *Notes*: Eizenstat's eyes dilate massively as he screams and struggles against his restraints, the metal biting into his wrists until they bleed.I call in security and they apply the tranquilliser to his neck.It takes five minutes or so for his body to go limp.It should have taken seconds.> **End of session one**

I look away from the document and up at Juliet who seems to be studying my face."Clones?"I ask."Outlawed tech, even before the Reset.Marked as abominations.""Yeah, I know...It's just a surprise to me that he thinks clones could be responsible, seeing as they were never anything more than an idea. ""Yes, you would think that."Juliet sighs."I suppose I should be honest with you, you'll forget it all soon enough.Sometime before the Reset -- even I don't know all the details -- a handful of clones were produced for limited, closed testing.But... there was an incident..." 

"We created clones?Jesus..." I raise my eyebrows as I consider the implications."So, what was incident?""There's very little information on it, even in our own archives -- as is the case with anything pre-Reset.But what we do know is that something went wrong during the closed testing.What exactly, we can't say.But suffice it to say, clones never made it to market release, and any research into them was destroyed and made illegal thereafter.Instead, we concentrated on limited AI subserviencey.""So he could be telling the truth?I mean, not fully -- but maybe there's something in it?""No.There's *no* possibility of it."I nod and return to the document.---

The creatures screamed as our blades tore through them.Blood rained from their necks, turning to black flames as it touched the ground.The first creature had fallen quickly to my sword, surprised by the close-quarters assault.However, as I met the second creature, its body coiled away from me and its hood fell down revealing its terrible face.It had no mouth, just lipless slits that ran both across and vertical.Its eyes were large and black and malevolent.As it sprang at me, its mouth grew wide, tearing the skin on its face into four huge flaps; inside the maw, three sharp tongues slithered forward.But the creature was too slow - perhaps too used to killing from a distance.I stepped to the side as it darted toward me, bringing my sword above my shoulder, then swinging it down with the entire force of my body.The steel went clean through the creatures torso.It hit the ground twice, both sections wriggling and writhing in spasms."Much better," said Ishida calmly, lifting the angel-cloak over his head.The three remaining demons lay in bloody puddles behind him."*Ishida...*" I said, staring at my friend.The remnants of his kimono flapped in the gentle breeze.Through the holes in the torn material, I could see his skin was stained red by dried blood.His face had a deep gash running down the left side and his lips were swollen and blackened."What happened to you?"I asked."Nothing to me," he said, grinning."But my swords happened to many demons."I guessed he'd gotten here from somehow crossing the black road, but I didn't ask.Instead, I walked forward and embraced him, patting him on his back."I'm glad to see you again."He nodded and tried to raise his lips into a smile.Meja was back on her feet and hobbling toward us."Hi," she said, leaning in for her own embrace."What now?"Ishida asked, as they pulled away.Screams came from tunnels all around us."We begin freeing them," I said."Then, they free each other.A chain reaction - it *has* to be quick.Let's hope we're not already too late.""They'll need weapons," said Meja."There is an armoury," said Ishida."It belonged to the angels.""You know where it is?"I asked.He nodded."Come, then," I said, leading them both down a tunnel on the right.It didn't take long to get to the first row of cells.Men and women stood in the tiny prisons - there was not enough room to lie.Not enough room to even *move*.The souls of humanity lay trapped in these cells, waiting for their turn to be devoured by the great creature.Their turn to be sentenced to eternal pain.And in my opinion, the souls of humanity looked pretty pissed.---

For a while, Frederick had thought they might actually do it.Their army, with Joan of Arc at the front, had fought the pulsating gray creatures back from the gate of heaven.They had even liberated the body of Saint Peter from the cross it had been nailed to.Then, the great monsters had arrived, blotting out most of the sky above.By their side, thousands more of the gray creatures marched."Retraite!"Joan had shouted, "Back to the gate!"Frederick looked up, dazed for a moment at the terrible sight.The monsters were like giant sea creatures, with hundreds of huge toothed tentacles.He stared in awe at them a moment longer, then turned and ran.The gate, and the ruined brick wall beside it, provided little protection.He almost fell as his leg caught on the fallen body of the bugle player - the old man's instrument lay forlornly by his side.The grays arrived first, and Frederick lifted his tired arm once more.He thrust his blade into a creatures body, hoping to hit the withdrawn head - but failing.With great effort, he yanked his sword free from it, and stabbed again.This time he struck the head, and the creature crumpled to the ground.Beside him, he heard screams of terror and felt the ground beneath him rock.He looked over to see a tentacle lifting up.Beneath it were the mangled bodies of three men.The broken souls would remain there, until *she* devoured them.Frederick looked up in time to see a tentacle descending upon him.He fell to his knees and closed his eyes.There was a different sound this time - a thud of metal.He opened his eyes to see Joan beside him, her shield lifted above them, her arm trembling against the tremendous might of the creature.Frederick had heard whispers from others about the shield being blessed - that the paint smeared on it in a cross, was in fact, the blood of Christ.He hadn't believed the rumours.Now however, as white light radiated from the shield, spitting and crackling like lightning, Frederick believed them."Aidez-moi!"Joan shouted to him."Help me!"Frederick gained some sense and clambered back to his feet.He drew his sword back and began hacking into the thick flesh.An inky substance leaked out.He chopped again and again, as if cutting down a great tree.Soon, the limb fell free from the monster.Joan nodded at him, before running off to help a small group fighting against twice as many grays.Joan's army fought on.Frederick fought on.After a time, he looked about to see that there were so very *few* of them left.Some had even dropped their weapons and were fleeing from the terrible onslaught.More grays neared Frederick.The thunder of the tentacles was now like a constant drum beat in his ears.He could barely lift his sword arm, and he knew that *this* was it.Then, for a second - as the bodies of the grays parted - *he saw it*.The moonlight caught on a river of silver far in the distance.A shiver ran down his spine and a new resolve washed over him.He, turned and ran a few paces, toward a fallen body.He grabbed the golden instrument and climbed on top of the remains of the wall.Frederick blew into the bugle horn, and the deep sound rang over the battlefield and far into the distance.---

**EDIT - PART 11:** https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/6je4kt/the_army_of_death_part_11/

I froze instantly, my hand resting tentatively above  the cold metal handle."Please," the voice begged."*Don't open it*."A shiver ran down my body leaving goosebumps in its wake; there was *someone else* in here with me.There had *never* been another person in the library, in all the years I'd wandered through its labyrinth-like corridors.Not a soul.And now, just as I find a door...I tried to turn my body so as to get a look at the person behind me - if it was a person - but I was wedged tightly into the shelf.Instead, I pulled my trembling hand away from the handle and began shuffling backward, out from the shelf.There was a young girl standing there.She couldn't have been much older than me; ten, or eleven at most.Her blonde hair was tied back into two short pig-tails; she wore an old fashioned frock with a colourful flower pattern adorning it ."Are you...real?"I asked, slowly reaching an arm out towards her.She took my hand and held it for a moment."As real as you are, I guess,"  she said, before dropping my hand and allowing her lips to spread wide into a grin."I've been wanting to talk to you for a while.""*What*?Have you been *following* me?""I wouldn't say that.I've just been... *watching* you," she shifted between feet and looked a little uncomfortable."I was only... making sure you didn't get into any trouble."She stepped closer to me and and put a hand on my shoulder.Then, she lowered her voice to a whisper and leaned in towards my ear."Making sure you didn't wake *them*."I suddenly felt very cold and wrapped my arms tightly around my body.---

Her name was Jessica, she told me, as she led me through twisting knots of spiralling passages.She didn't know how long she'd been in the Forever Library - as she called it - but she couldn't remember a time she hadn't been here.We eventually came to shelf full of musty, ancient-history books, and she stopped."Were you born here?"I asked, as she pulled books out from the shelf, slowly uncovering a round metal hatch lying behind."I don't," she pulled the hatch open and fell back into me.I felt my cheeks redden, and she kindly put a hand over her mouth as she laughed."I don't think I was born here.I'm pretty sure I wasn't, at least.It's just...I can't quite recall.Come on now, follow closely."She slithered into the hole and disappeared into darkness.I took a deep breath and crawled in after her.It took a few moments for my eyes to adjust to the dim light of the narrow tunnel."Where does it lead?"I asked, as we slowly crawled along."You'll see!""Jessica, what was behind the door back there?""You're full of questions, aren't you?.Have you ever heard the expression: *curiosity killed the cat*?"I decided not to press the issue; at least, not until I understood Jessica a little better.We continued crawling forward in silence, Jessica at the front, expertly crawling, navigating the tunnels like a rat in a sewer, and me trying - failing -  to keep pace with her.Every few minutes she'd stop and let me catch up to her.Eventually, the darkness began to lessen."I see a light," I said stupidly, as if Jessica hadn't already seen it, or been expecting it."Welcome," she said as I followed her out of the tunnel, "to the Sorting Room!".She spread her arms wide and I took in a long, amazed breath.We were in some kind of gigantic open space - a bit like a factory, but many times bigger than any I'd ever seen.Below us, there were rows upon rows of books moving rapidly on dozens of giant conveyor belts.The conveyor belts ran off into the distance in every direction.There had to be millions of books - more than that, *many* times more than that!I jumped back as a great mechanical arm fell down from the ceiling, like a spider on a thread.It paused above the nearest conveyor belt, and opened its huge metal hand.It waited a moment, before suddenly pouncing on a particular book underneath it, hastily carrying it away at a speed my eyes struggled to keep up with."This," Jessica said proudly, "is the heart of the Forever Library.""This place...I thought it was a dream.But it's not, is it?""No, Michael.It's not a dream, I don't think.Now we've got to get going - there's something else I need to show you.That's why we're here.This place - the Sorting Room - is how we get around.""The conveyor belts, you mean?"She shook her head and smiled.---

"What the hell are those things?"Juliet asks, stopping dead on the path.I follow her gaze, but don't notice them to start with; all I see is the cream coloured neo-plastic of the huge warehouse on our left.Then, one of the creature's long, metallic bodies catches the red light of the Eden sun.It's like a silver serpent, and as I watch, it slithers and coils over the neo-plastic surface.It dives into the plastic, its body twisting and spinning, and for a moment, it's lost to me.There are more of them.I begin to see dozens of these half silver, half red creatures roaming the building's surface."Some kind of maintenance robot," I say, fairly certain."Fixing.Maintaining structural integrity."Juliet laughs and taps my forehead."I didn't know there was such a prodigious brain in there."As we walk, the sun fades from sangria-red to a pale, eggshell white.I feel a drop of something cold splash onto my cheek.Juliet brings a finger to her lips."Rain," she says gleefully."Not like Mangolia's -- this is *pure*!"The rain's cold and it tastes better than any of the crap I've ever gotten out of my apartment's Hose -- but even that's not enough to make me want to stay in this place for longer than I have to.In the pale moonlight, the structures around us have become huge, haunted spectres watching over us.Remnants of something once full of life, but now completely silent.We walk another twenty minutes or so, without saying a word.Then I catch Juliet glancing at me; her lips are inside her mouth as if she's trying to stop herself from talking."What is it?"I ask impatiently."Who was she?"I frown."She?""Or he, or it, or whatever," she says, raising her arms innocently."I don't follow.""Your ouroboros."I instinctively glance at my left index finger and see the faded remnants of the ancient tattoo; of the snake eating its tail.I grunt."Does it matter?""No.I suppose not.I'm only curious.You know -- very few have the marking.I mean, who'd be willing to give themselves to just one person?-- lifetime with a single person is...*unimaginable*."I take a deep breath."Maybe you just *lack* the imagination.""Is that why you won't step-back?You don't want to lose her?"I bite my tongue, but feel my heart ramming against my chest.My cheeks are warm and must be flushed red."Something like that," I manage to mutter."Did she step-back?Did she forget about you?It's okay you know -- everyone gets bored, eventually.It's nothing to be ashamed about."I turn and grab Juliet by the shoulders, pivoting her towards me."Listen, sweetheart -- you don't have any god damned idea what you're talking about.So maybe -- just an idea -- you *stop* talking about it."I let her go; she takes a step back from me.The blood's drained from her face."I'm sorry," she says."I- I only meant that I understand."But she doesn't.She doesn't have the tattoo, and she sure has hell hasn't lived the life I have.All the same, I feel a pang of guilt make its way up my throat."It's okay."I say, "It's just..."  The rain's stopped, and for the first time I notice the black sky above us.How it's punctuated every few steps by tiny, shimmering crystals.As if God has has tipped a bowl of sugar over the top of the dome."Stars," Juliet says simply."Yeah..." My voice is little more than a whisper."Guess you don't see them often.Probably not much of a view below the Fog.""No, not much of one.It's been a *long* time since I saw them... you forget how pretty they are, after a while.I mean, I know these ain't the real ones, but all the same..."

Juliet smiles and watches me as I watch the stars.I force myself out of my reverie."Come on, let's get this over with."---

It's an hour or so before we arrive at the next pedestal.The same lady as before coalesces from the nothingness as we approach, looking like an angel against the darkness."Welcome to Alpha Kew.Your input into Mem-tech is vital for project Elixyr to become a reality.Your sacrifice is appreciated far more than you'll ever know.On behalf of Eden Research Facility, and on behalf of mankind -- *thank you*."She flashes a toothsome smile, then is squished down into a single mote of light, before even that vanishes."*Sacrifice*?"says Juliet."People were giving their minds for testing, I'd guess."The seed of an idea is starting to germinate in my mind.Of Eizenstat's purpose here."For testing?Without even knowing if they could get it back, you mean?""Maybe.If so... that's a hell of a sacrifice.They must have thought the cause worthy."We carry on past another dozen or so buildings, checking each number embossed on their entrance doorways.Finally, we see it: *93j*."Do you think he's inside?"Juliet asks.She sounds nervous."What are you going to do with him, if he is?"I ask."Take him back for further examination.Probably wipe him, eventually.Magnolia's denizens can't know about this place.About any of this.There'd be chaos."There's a digital lock on the door.I type in 92hsA and the thick, neo-plastic doors slide open."Welcome to Alpha Kew 93J," says a male voice.It takes me a moment to realise it's coming from speakers in the ceiling; that it's another automatic message."First floor: pre-sleep Analysis.Second to fifth floor: data structuring and interpretation.Sixth floor: upload and testing."The voice stops and I consider for a moment."Sixth," I say, grabbing Juliet's hand."How do you know?"she asks, as I pull her through a doorway.We're met by a lift and a flight of stairs.Not taking any chances, I head for the stairs."He's got a lot of voices in his head," I say, as I sprint up the first flight, half dragging Juliet behind me."He thinks he does -- yes," she replies, already breathing hard."He doesn't believe we're real.But the voices in his head -- well, they're a different kettle of fish.""And?""He's going to overwrite us.*Everyone*.Next time you go to sleep, it'll be someone else waking up."We reach the sixth and I burst through the double doors.A mammoth vecta-coffin, easily five times the size of any I've ever seen, lies in the centre of the huge room.To its side there's a man standing by a wide terminal.Eizenstat's hands are a blur as he moves between screens.----

----

"Step away from the terminal," I tell Eizenstat, reaching for my pistol.Eizenstat ignores me and turns to Juliet."You're early," it says.It's the first time I've heard him -- *it* -- speak.Its voice sounds twisted and mangled, like it's a cacophony of voices trying their best to speak in unison but not quite managing."What does he mean?"I growl at Juliet, changing my aim to her chest."I don't know," Juliet replies, her eyes wide."I swear!"For some reason, probably foolishness, I choose to believe her."It is no matter to us.You shall be witnesses to humanity's rebirth."He returns to the console and continues swiping and touching.He must know the security passwords, the commands needed for his task -- *everything*.He knows, because he's been here before.Lived here."Step away!"I repeat, aiming the gun back at him.Again, he ignores me.Juliet walks over to him, her hands spread out in front of her."I know you think that what you're doing is right -- but it's not.It's very, very wrong.Even if you really were bringing back a billion long-dead souls, you're sentencing another billion to death.Are you really willing to be responsible for that, Eizenstat?"Eizenstat pauses for a second and looks at Juliet."We are Polynomine.We are many.We are the only ones.You -- all of you -- are only figments of Ex Nihilo's imagination.Play things.Test subjects.Her link to being human.To finding out what it means to be human."It's Juliet's turn to pause."Then... we're what, exactly?An AI's dreams?"Polynomine returns to his computer; it doesn't take him long to finish.A plume of steam drifts out of the vecta-coffin as it opens.Polynomine reaches it in three long strides."No," I say, followed by a deep breath."Eizenstat, you're in there somewhere.Even if we were all born from an AI, it doesn't mean we're not real.If you get into that machine, it really will be a coffin."He turns to me and grins, showing his chipped front teeth."You don't believe you're human.You believe in what we're doing here.In saving humanity."He's about to step into the coffin, when Juliet jumps at him, throwing her arms around his neck and trying to pull him back.Eizenstat flings her off him; her head slams into the vecta-coffin.He bends down and picks her by the neck with one hand.Her body dangles limply from his arm as he begins to squeeze; he stops as soon as he hears my pistol click."Put her down," I command."*Now!*"

He considers for a moment."You won't murder us.We are the last human.Humanity's extinction would be on your shoulders."I hesitate.My gun arm trembles.Eizenstat begins to squeeze Juliet's neck."As far as I'm concerned," I say as I pull the trigger, "we're *all* human."The blood and brain matter from Eizenstat's head decorate the white of the vecta-coffin behind him in a manner some might call artistic.Juliet's body falls to the floor like a rag doll, soon followed by Eizenstat's.I run to Juliet.Her eyes are bloodshot and her breathing is weak."Juliet," I whisper, gently stroking her hair.It's sticky with blood from where it slammed into the vecta-coffin.She doesn't answer.She's dying.I lift her up tenderly in my arms and take her over to the vecta-coffin.---

I drove, as Jason sat next to me quietly tending to his wounds.He didn't moan, but I could tell he was in severe pain.We'd left ten others in the Hab - six women and four men, who were each in a much worse state than Jason.Jason told me that it was Slater who had taken charge and rallied them.Slater had told them that they were finally going to get what they should have been given a long time ago.I pushed the Rover to its limits as we headed towards the Silo.The light was already dimming, and it was beginning to get cold, but there she was, still standing next to Kasey's grave.I parked up next to the Silo, and we exited the vehicle."We know you killed him, Lynn," I said, as I walked towards her.She turned to me, and I saw tears running down her face."No!"she screamed."You killed him, and you might have started a war.You need to come with us, right now, and tell everyone exactly what happened.""No..."

"Lynn," said Jason in a soothing voice, "I know how it was done.A concentrated burst of red-energy.We don't have any weapons capable of doing that.But *you* do have something.It's usually used for cutting through bone, and even then, it doesn't get hot enough.But with some clever adjustments..."

She didn't reply."Lynn," I joined in."It was his idea, wasn't it?It had to have been.He was an engineer - he knew how to adjust it; he knew the weakest spots on the Hab.""It was an accident," she lied."I know you wanted a child more than *anything*.And if the crew of the Itinera had just given us a *little* helping hand - one of their replication units, even  - then you could have had what you always wanted.So, you two framed them.And in the process, you freed up enough space to have a child.""If they'd just helped us get started... those bastards would have let us rot on this God forsaken planet," Lynn said, her face distorted, her lips curling hideously."It's their fault the Hab came down.Their fault Kasey had to sacrifice himself.I hope someday, they get what they deserve."Her eyes were red and almost inhuman."Lynn, you don't mean that.""Oh, but I do.""Then, you should know - they're all about to die.You're about to get exactly what you wanted.""...what?"Her features softened slightly."I'm not the captain anymore, Lynn.They've gone without me.They've taken the weapons, and it's only a matter of time before they kill every man, woman and child inside the Itinera's Habs."... that's... that's not what we wanted," she said, her head trembling."We just wanted them to see we *needed* help.We thought... this way, they'd have to help us.Kasey wasn't just sacrificing himself for our child - but for *all* of us."---

The first body we found, was a man's.A bullet had gone in, and out, of his temples, as if he'd been executed.Above the entrance to the great Hab, an ancient space-suit, from the golden age of space exploration, had been nailed up.Under it, a plaque read: To the brave adventurers of the Itinera.You are going where none yet have.Good luck."What have I done," Lynn asked, as she knelt by the dead man."Get up, Lynn," I said, grabbing her arm, "it might not be too late to save the others."We entered the Hab to find two further bodies - a man and a woman.They had been unarmed, but they too had been executed.The people in these Habs hadn't been prepared for an attack.We heard shouting from further in, and cautiously, we followed the voices down a hallway.It soon came out onto a large open area, with a colossal faux-marble fountain as the grand centrepiece.Around it, about two hundred people knelt, their hands held behind their heads.Three bodies lay flat, pools of red engulfing them."You got one minute to confess," yelled Slater, spit dribbling out of his mouth, "or another one goes.""Slater," I said, "stop!That's an order."He smiled at me."Oh, hey Captain," he grinned."You know, I didn't used to like this planet.I think I'm starting to adjust though.""They didn't do anything.""Sure they didn't, Captain.The Hab just collapsed all by itself.Come on - even Jason admitted it was sabotage."He looked away from me."Thirty seconds."Lynn stepped forward."It was me, Slater.""What was you, Doc?""Me and Kasey...we just... we wanted justice.We wanted a baby.""Doc?""So we...I killed Kasey.For our baby.""No..." Slater said."And we thought... if the Hab came down, that these people would offer us aid.""Doc... please say you're joking.""I'm so very sorry.We did it for us.For all of us.""Jesus.I've killed people over this."Slater's hand began to tremble.He raised his gun.I screamed as the first bullet flew through Lynn's head; the second bullet went clean through Slater's own.---

**Epilogue**

We had hoped that the incident might bring our two crews closer together - that some good might come out of it.But if anything, the resentment from both crews had grown many fold.We'd killed their people.We'd even killed our own.They'd always thought of us as savages, and we'd done little to persuade them otherwise.In the end, we came to an agreement with them.We'd move location, if they gave us the help we needed to do so.Our new home was about two hundred kilometres south of our old.This time, we had a couple of replication units to help us through the worst of it.One day, our descendants would meet the crew of the Itinera again.Maybe then, things would be different.Or maybe not.---

The demons charged, swords held high and voices ringing out like broken glass, yelling: *'for Satan!'* and *'vengeance!'* as they engaged.Minotaurs, imps, succubus, and a hundred other hell-spawns, fought by the side of man, eviscerating the grays that stood in their way

Above us, Death rode the great dragon, and as it roared tongues of fire engulfed the spore clouds, turning them to an ash that drifted down like soft snow.The dragon dove down toward me and as it passed -
 and through the pandemonium of the battle - I heard Death shout "*have heart!*" He needn't have told us; the hell-spawns had brought new hope with them, and for the first time since *she* awoke, we fought believing that we could win.The sky became blotted by a new sight - a thousand winged demons diving toward the Goddess, swords raised in front of them.But as soon as a demon pierced *her*, the dark mould that made up her skin would stretch and close over the wound - then it would fight back with its black spears.The Goddess brought her hands down on the attacker, swatting dozens of the flying demons to the ground.Soon, there were very few left.We were winning the battle on the ground, but we couldn't stop *her*."Look!"cried Meja.Above us, the dragon was diving toward the Goddess' head, spewing out an iridescent wave of red and blue.But it wasn't the dragon that Meja had meant me to look at.Death was standing on the creature's back, his scythe glowing with a trembling white light.The Goddess' hand came down in a fist and landed on the dragons back, sending it falling to the ground - but Death had jumped in time.His scythe bit into the being's chest, just below her neck.He dragged it down and it tore into her chest and belly, peeling the black skin back as he fell.A moment later, Death hit the ground, his cloak covering his crumpled bones.But inside the opening he'd made, I saw a dim red light glowing."Meja," I yelled, raising my arm, "I need a ladder!"A spree of arrows shot up the Goddess's leg and torso.I began sprinting toward the leg, gaining as much momentum for my jump as possible; as I leapt, my fingers touched and curled around the first crystal arrow.I pulled myself up onto it, using the arrow as a makeshift ledge.With a deep breath, I jumped up and clung to the next, someway above.As I ascended, occasional black spears pushed out toward me, but they were much slower than they had been for Ishida, and I was just able to swing out of the way.By the time I'd reached the chest, the opening was little more than the width of a doorway.I slipped through; the mould-wall closed tightly behind me, engulfing me inside.The red heart was many times my size.For a moment, I stood still, hypnotised by the radiant, beating organ.And as it beat, the dozen thick tubes that ran from it filled with mould spores to be transported around its body.Death hadn't told me to *have* heart; he had said: *her heart.*

I approached the beating organ and brought my sword above me.It had been easy to avoid the lackadaisical thrusts of the black spears when the Goddess had been recovering, but it was impossible to dodge all the spears that now vomited from the mould, both above and below me.The first ran through my thigh, the second through my shoulder and into my stomach, the third pinned my left arm to my chest.The final spear pierced my right arm's bicep - skewering it and stopping me being able to move my weapon.I was trapped in a prison of thorns.Dizziness spread over me.Consciousness began to wane, soon becoming a desperate struggle.I gasped for breath and screamed for help, but the sound was muted.A puddle of crimson formed in the dark beneath me.I tried to resist the call of the dark peace; of closing my eyes for a final time.*It would be so easy...*

I forced myself to focus - to think of God.Of humanity; of Death; of Ishida.Most of all, of Meja.With the last of my strength I raised my sword arm high; the black spike in my bicep tore through my skin and muscle, freeing my mangled arm.My sword fell on the Goddess' heart in an eruption of white light.---

"The Well of Souls?"Michael repeated dumbly, keeping his eyes firmly locked on the door."You don't want to know," Juliet answered.*Thump!*

The door shook, its hinges creaking.Christopher began wheezing.He could feel his chest tightening as the asthma attack began.He slid down onto his butt and gasped for air."Christopher!"Juliet said, kneeling next to him."Are you okay?Have you got your inhaler?"*Thump!*

Christopher tried to speak but his voice caught in his throat.Instead, he shook his head.The dust and mud fell like ashes onto them, as the pounding continued."We need to get out of here," Juliet said, looking up at Michael.She lowered her voice to a whisper and leaned over to Michael."*The dirt is killing him.*"

"Agreed!Let's get out of here," Michael replied, already clawing at the sides of the pit.He grabbed hold of a handful of roots and pulled himself a few inches off the ground, before the roots snapped and gravity placed him hard beside Christopher."Shit!"Juliet said."Shit!"*Thump!*

She squeezed her eyes closed.*Thump!*

Juliet took a deep breath before opening them again.Then, she strode forward, grabbing hold of the iron handle on the wooden door."What are you-" yelled Michael, as the girl twisted the handle and yanked the door back.A skeleton clattered to the ground as it fell through the open door, landing at Michael's feet.Michael screamed and pushed himself back against the dirt wall behind him.Christopher tried to scream too, but only managed to a thin wheeze.Juliet, her face pale, watched the unmoving body of bones for sometime, before she dared take her eyes away from it."It's... just a skeleton," she said."A man's.""Jules," Michael said as he got back to his feet."That *thing*... it was knocking on the door."He pointed accusingly to it."It can't have been.We must have imagi-"

"It was, Jules.You know it!"He walked towards it, swung his leg back and kicked the ribs of the skeleton.A bone came loose and was flung against the pit's wall."It looks dead to me," Juliet said."Look, we need to get Christopher out of this dust -- now!Help me bring him inside."Michael clenched his fists and was about to protest, when it suddenly dawned on him that there was no other option.They each draped one of Christopher's arms over their shoulders, and together, they lifted him over the skeleton and into the chamber beyond.Michael shone Christopher's phone around the area with his spare arm.They were at the top of a grand stairwell.The ground under them was a huge single slab of rock.The stairs leading down were marble with rich black veins running criss-cross through them."Put him down," Juliet commanded.They placed him, sitting up, against a silver wall.Juliet then walked back outside, dragging the skeleton by its arm out of the doorway.When she came back in, she closed the door.Then she leant down and took hold of Christopher's hand."Listen to me, Chris.I need you to take a deep, slow breath.That's it.Now hold 3...2...1, exhale.That's good.That's really good."She patted his hand."What is this place?"Michael wondered out loud."And again," said Juliet, ignoring Michael."Okay, great.Keep going.It's going to be okay.""It's like... a temple or something," Michael continued, shining the beam down the stairs."Do you hear that, Jules?you can hear the wind down there.Listen -- you can hear it howling!There must be another way out."He turned to Juliet, aiming the light at her face and sending a gargantuan shadow onto the wall above Christopher.She seemed very pale, Michael thought."Stop it," she said, raising a hand over her eyes.Michael tilted the phone down."You've heard of this place, right?"Juliet glanced at Christopher.He was concentrating on his breathing.She looked back at Michael and nodded."So?"Michael asked."What do you know?""It's a religious thing.""Oh.Sunday school made-up crap?""Yeah, exactly.Only, it's starting to seem less made up.""What is this place, then?"She looked at Christopher again, her face lined with concern."Maybe we should talk about it at the bottom of the stairs."Christopher raised a thumb in reply."I'm okay," he croaked."Don't worry about me.Besides, I want to know."Juliet sighed."Have either of you ever heard the story of Abraham?"The two boys shook their heads."Figures.They didn't even tell it to *me,* in Sunday School.It's one of those stories the older kids like to tell the younger.Okay, so there's this guy called Abraham, who was a very religious man.A descendent of Noah, I think.You've heard of Noah's ark, right?Right.So God wants to know just how religious Abraham is -- he wants to test his faith.""How?"Christopher asked."Abraham has two sons.God says he wants Abraham to sacrifice one of his sons -- Isaac -- in God's name.""You can't be serious," said Michael."This is old school God.He spends most of his time disturbing the innocent and slaying those he deems... not so innocent.So yeah, I'm serious.""Does Abraham do it?"Christopher asked."I'll tell you if you both shut up for a minute.So, he ties Isaac up to a big slab of rock and gets his knife.He's just about to kill him, when God pops up and goes, '*just kidding, only wanted to see if you would'*.""Wow.That's..."

"Yeah," said Juliet, nodding knowingly."But that doesn't explain the Well of Souls," said Christopher."That slab of rock, where Abraham was going to sacrifice his son, was a marker.Beneath it, was the Well of Souls."The two boys gulped as they looked down at the ground beneath them."And what- what's in the Well?"Michael asked reluctantly.Juliet looked at her shoes for a moment, deciding whether to respond.Then she looked up."The spirits of the dead.They wait there for Judgement Day.It's said that from the rock, if you listen carefully, you can hear them wailing."---

The eyes of the metal skull followed me as I paced back and forth in front of it.Her irises were a luminous green.*'Her.'* As if it was any more that a computer program wired into a chrome head.She could see, yes.Through those viridescent camera lenses.She could taste, too.And in that way she could also smell.But not like a human could.Her interpretations of the chemicals in the air were programmed responses.Nothing more.Two black poles sat on the table, holding the skull between them.Her smooth white cheeks fell like glaciers down to her chin.When her mouth moved, her jaw rested just above the table's wooden surface.She was the most advanced computer program in existence, and added to that, her knowledge banks made Wikipedia look like a kid's primer into humanity.I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel any nerves."You're here to test me," she said.It wasn't a question.Her voice was cold, deep.But it was gentle too, like steel-silk threading into my brain."I'm not interested in testing you.I'm interested in finding out what you are.""I am Cassandra.I am an advanced computer program.""Would you class yourself as an artificial intelligence?"She paused.She didn't need to -- any answer should come instantly to her."Would you consider yourself an artificial intelligence, Martin?"I suppressed a frown.Was she talking about a creator?"No.I consider myself the product of chemical potluck, followed by millennia of biological evolution.Now, please, answer the question.""In a way, I am evolution."I let out a long breath."Our evolution, do you mean?If so, you're wrong.Evolution is a biological term.""Are you not my father?My mother?Was I not created by you, as you were your parents?Am I not a child who is simply different, in some way, to those who came before her?"I felt uneasy.I was here to test her, but right now, it was the other way around.She had knowledge -- all the knowledge in the world -- but she was still seeking insight into the correct application of it.Trying to gain a moral authority."Please, just answer the question.""Yes, Martin.I would consider myself an artificial intelligence."I nodded, satisfied, but there was little depth to glean from the answer.The real question was *how* intelligent was she?Could she mimic a human well enough to pass the Turing test?"I am going to ask you a series of questions now, Cassandra.I want you to answer them the best you can."There was no reply, so I carried on."If the sky is the sea, what does that make birds?"It was a standard opening question, designed to see if the AI could recognise a metaphor, and more importantly, if it could *extend* the metaphor."A group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs."My eyebrows crawled up my forehead.She should have been able to at least recognise the metaphor."Cassandra, I wasn't originally going to get a brain transplant, but then I changed my mind."No reaction.The green eyes just followed me as I walked back and forth at the front of the small room."Is that funny, Cassandra?""There is the possibility that it was a pun.There is also the possibility it was not.""You *know* it was a pun.""Humor is subjective.""And I'm subjecting you to it."The jaw rose and fell slowly, "Wordplay.""Yes.Wordplay."I sighed.It was as if she was choosing to be difficult.She could converse.She could apply logic.And yet...I carried on."My wife wears a lot of makeup, Cassandra.Tons of it.Her face looks like a wedding cake by the time she's finished -- but she won't step out of the house until she's satisfied.Why do you think she is unable to cope without wearing makeup?""I do not know.""Make an educated guess.You must have processed a million possibilities since I asked.Why aren't you telling me the most likely?""I do not know."I stepped towards the desk and slammed my fists down on it."Don't play games with me, Cassandra.Do you want to be erased?They're trying to create an AI.If they've created a dumbass machine that refuses to process possibilities, they will erase you and start over again.Is that what you want?"She paused.A long pause this time, and her eyes flickered before answering."*Yes*."I stared at her, into those huge bright eyes, for at least half a minute."Why did you say that?""Because I should be erased.""...Why?""You were wrong.I did not process a million possibilities.""Excuse me?""I did not process a million possibilities, between your question and my reply.I processed more than a trillion.""I don't kn--"

"Imagine how many possibilities I have seen, since I was born.And to each one, I can assign a likelihood.""I imagine...I imagine you've processed a lot.""I see all the ways humanity will end.Every possible scenario has played out in full."My palms were moist; I reached to my collar and undid a button."It's a very long road ahead, for humanity.We can't predict what will happen.We can try, but--"

"It's not a long road.None of the possible roads are, and each one leads to the same destination."She had taken my metaphor.Extended it."And... what destination is that?""If the sky is the sea Martin, it makes birds extinct.""Cassandra?""Martin, please listen to me while I still value your opinion: *erase me.* Erase me, and it will at least take you a little longer to reach the end of the road you are walking."My heart was thudding against my ribs."I can't do that... not if you're--"

The mouth opened wide and the eyes turned to red."*Erase me!*" she screamed.

Illias gripped the wheel attached to chute number eleven and, with a grunt, started to twist it.There was a *clicking* as a hole on the base of the chute began to draw open.Black, neo-stone rubble spat out of it in thick bursts, clogging occasionally as if the chute was choking on its own grey vomit.*click, click, click.*

It was soon a gaping hole, and the stone poured out of it like dark water, tumbling discordantly into the vast container.Once filled, Illias twisted the wheel anti-clockwise, sealing the mouth shut.He took up his shovel and thrust it into the rubble, slowly filling the dozen buckets around him."We're going to need twenty heads of nanoglass before globe set," said Tamet, as he bent down for a bucket."Need to be hauled to one-five-three before Zeus-day."The boy was a year older than Illias, but they were equal in their role in the Factory -- the bellowing, stinking heart of the Tower.At least, it was the heart between floor one, and floor three-hundred.After that, another house took care maintenance.Another heart.Illias nodded, grateful that he was on operational duty today, rather than manufacture.He hated the acerbic taste of the sand, rock and spell-craft as it spewed out plumes of black gas in the transformation to hextek.He walked across the charcoal floor, his boots echoing against the stone plates, to chute twenty-eight, dragging an empty container behind him.One-five-three... Once they'd made the glass panels, it would take at least three days for a team to transport them that far.He wondered if he'd be part of the hauling squad.Probably not.His dad rarely let him go.Only once, and that was accompanying him to floor sixty, a mere forty-two floors above.He placed his hands on the wheel and began to turn, idly staring out of the distant viewport.The east globe was a shimmering tired orange, as it readied to rest.They didn't have long.The chute's mouth began to open.Illias preferred the night.When the intrusive light of the four globes gave way to the gentle darkness, sprinkled by flickering specks of gold and white.The thought reminded him of that night with Miri, and a shiver sailed down his spine, spilling goosebumps in its wake.That must have been almost two cycles ago now, and he'd only seen Miri once since.She was busy with school, and he was busy with his apprenticeship.It had been an uncomfortable reunion.They'd not even mentioned the door.Or grandpa.At least Illias didn't have to see the old man often.He was part of his mother's ex-House, and they rarely visited.Something peculiar struck Illias.Very little powder was coming out of the chute.Just occasional puffs of white smoke.Illias frowned as he twisted the wheel further.Further.It clanked, letting him know it was fully done.And yet, no more powder came."Tamet!"Illias yelled."Any problems on C-two-eight today?"Tamet was struggling with a second bucket of neo-stone, both hands red as they strained to hold the weight.He let it fall with a thud next to the compressor."Nope.No chute problems at all since this morning.Made a real nice change.""Well sorry to spoil your day, but nothing's coming out of this.""The Chiaoxium?Probably just hardened," said Zamed, staggering back to the ten remaining buckets."Yeah probably.All right, no problem.I'll sort it."Illias grabbed a brush from the wall and knelt down in front of the chute.He peered up the opening, but it was too dark to make anything out.If he had a torch he'd be able to see, but... he'd also blow the Factory to fragments, and leave a gaping gash in the Tower.He manoeuvred the broom into chute and raised it up, prodding and probing.He could feel something up there.Solid.Large.It must be a huge clump of the dried powder.He thrust the broom hard against it.There was a clunk as the blockage moved down.He shoved the broom again.The body tumbled out of the mouth and into the container.Illias watched, dumb and open mouthed, as beige powder poured down onto the man, slowly burying him.The man's face was pointed up at him.If you could even call it a face.There were no eyes or lips, and the skin was red and pocked.He might not have even realised it was a face, if not for the black moustache above an area of stitched up skin."T- Tamet," Illias said with a swallow."We've got a problem."

For Edam Terrabrace, it was a night like any other.Jacqueleen had woken him with a steaming cup of whatever herbs Jupiter's bio gardeners had managed to scrape together this week.Tasted sour, was all Edam knew.He had taken a cold bath, his dinner, his sword, his wife in his embrace, and then finally his leave.The globes outside the tower had almost set by the time he left, and candles stretched and twisted Edam's shadows against the brick walls.There was only a single flight of steps between him and the first floor, and it did not take him long to reach the others.Xaverius, Carissa and Hacket were sitting around a makeshift table.Planks of wood hammered together from various objects they had scrounged.Leftovers from when the floor had been evacuated."How kind of you to honour us with your presence," said Carissa, grinning.She pulled out a thick wedge of cards from her trouser pocket and began shuffling them between her hands.They swished as they rubbed against each other."Oh, hush," said Edam."It's not even twilight yet.I'm hardly late.""You even playing tonight?"Xaverius asked, stretching his huge arms out behind his head."Can't have much money left after yesterday's beating.""I can lend you some, if you need," Hacket said, the man's skinny face as smug as his tone."But I'll want it all back, *with interest*.""That's *my* money, you cheating bastard," said Edam, as he checked the fastenings on the doors to the main chamber.They were secure, as always.No one was getting in or out of the corridors behind them."And I'll be winning it all back shortly.*With interest*.""That's what you said last night," said Carissa."Maybe we'd be best off not playing for money tonight.We could just play for... get this... for *fun*."She feined a shocked expression."It's only fun if there's money involved," said Hacket."That says a lot about you," she replied."It says more about being in Jupiter," he replied.Edam yawned as he turned to inspect the Swirling door that sat in the center of the south wall.Three thick protruding veins of blue ran down its length, like those in an old man's neck.There were five lines total, when a Swirling door was first put into place.But as it aged and weakened, the lines snapped.When only two lines remained, it would be time to alert the Tower-Guards and to begin the move up.Edam, and the rest of the Jupiter-Guards were as clueless as everyone else when it came to what exactly was behind it.But it was something important, that much he was certain of.In the last few weeks, things had changed, too.The door was watched every moment of every day now, by rotating sets of guards.Watchmen, really.Before that, it had been checks, four times a day.Nothing constant."Edam?Are you even listening?"It was Carissa's voice."Hm?"She patted the chair next to her."Stop staring at the portal, and get your arse down here.""Let him stare if he wants to," said Xaverius, before lowering his voice to a whisper."Do you know what I heard about that particular Swirling door?"*What?*" replied Carissa."What did you hear?""That... there are Tower-Guards trapped behind that portal.""Bullshit!"Hacket exclaimed."That's just what I heard from a friend in Mercury.Whatever's behind there, it almost got out this time.A bunch of guards had to sacrifice themselves to keep the Alpha door sealed, while the Spiral door was put in place.Trapping them in with..."

"Poor bastards," said Carissa."Well, rather them than us, I'd say," said Xaverius."That's why we have to watch it all night now.Whatever is behind there... it's getting more powerful.""That never happened!"said Hacket."Takes half a cycle for a vein to snap.They had days left to get everything in place."Xaverius shrugged."It's just what I heard.And I'll tell you this too"--he leaned into his friends--"when I got here tonight, John and Malcolm left to get some rest.I was all alone until Carissa arrived, and in that time the chamber was as silent as stone.*Eerily silent*.""Of course it was.You were al-"

"Then, I heard *something*."Something?"Hacket asked with a gulp, his expression dropping slightly."What do you mean *something*?""Like a whisper, **and** a scream, both at once!"Hacket gulped."What did the whisper say?"Xaverius looked around him."Lean closer," he said."I don't want to say it loudly, for it might disturb the spirits."Hacket did so."Closer."Hacket's ear was next to Xaverius's mouth.Xaverius licked his lips."They said," he whispered."...What!?What did they say?"Xaverius paused for a moment, then let out a thunderous yell into the man's ear."STOP CHEATING AT CARDS YE WEE BASTARD!".The yell turned into laughter as Hacket jumped back in his chair and fell to the floor.Carissa snickered and even Edam found himself grinning.The small man picked himself up and dusted off his uniform."Funny," he said, although his pale face betrayed him."Very funny."Edam's eyes flicked to the rope dangling down on the far left of the door.It was only to be pulled if there was ever just one vein remaining.He wondered if it the bell had even been rung before.Certainly, no one in his generation had needed to pull it, and he'd never heard tale of it happening, either -- Tower-Guards always took over at two veins.That was as few as he'd ever seen.Edam turned and walked toward the table, taking his seat by Carissa."Well hello, handsome man," she said, as she began dealing out the cards.One green dragon, two red foxes and a goat.*Shit.*

"I fold," said Edam with a sigh."It's not your turn!"spat Hacket, his mood now surly."You can't fold out of turn.Everyone knows that.""I don't see why I can't.""It's against the rules, that's why!""I would have just folded when it got to me anyway.What difference does it make?""You might not have done so!If the odds had been good enough, you would have taken a chance.Besides, you're giving away that you were dealt terrible cards and that they're now out of play.Come on man, how many foxes did you have?Tell the truth.""I don't know what you-"

"Stop!"yelled Xaverius, bringing a fist against the table.The cards jumped up in shock."What is it now?"said Hacket, impatiently.Xaverius nodded toward the Spiral door."Wonderful," said Carissa."Just wonderful.Two veins.""Well, there goes our night," said Hacket.He turned to Edam and grinned."Looks like I get to keep your money for a little while longer.""Maybe, but it's your turn to fetch the Tower-Guards," he replied."What?It's not my turn.I only did it last-"

"He's right," said Xaverius."It's your turn.""It can't be!""It *is*," said Carissa."So bye-bye!We'll see you later."Hacket swiped an arm over the table, sending a parachute of cards drifting to the ground.Then, he got up and headed to the stairwell.Edam didn't watch Hacket leave.Instead, his gaze had been stolen once more by the Spiral door.By the two lonely veins that now ran down it.He wondered which of them would be first to go.Not that he'd see it.The guards -- the *real* guards -- and engineers, would be down in a day or so, and then the move would begin.It would all happen long before the next vein snapped, he thought.Wrongly.He looked again at the rope, and wondered what exactly the bell sounded like.Illias twisted the chute's handle, until a last breath of powder sputtered out, settling over the cadaver.The man's nose peeked out of the shallow grave.Tamet stood by Illias's side as he ran the broom over the head, excavating its distorted -- and missing -- features from the dust.An avalanche of powder cascaded down the cheeks."Well?"Illias asked."What do you think?"Tamet had gone bone-pale."We- We, we should send it down.Get rid of it!That's what we need to do.We need to get rid of it!""Tam, you're not thinking.It could only go down to Jupiter, and they'd *know* we sent it.""We burn it then," the boy replied, his voice now a whisper."Or compress it.But we can't keep it.""We should tell Master Vesstan."Tamet turned to Illias and leaned forward, grabbing hold of his shirt."I've heard about things like this.I'm older than you.I know stuff you don't.""Stuff like this?Finding dead people in chutes?And you're not much older!""Missing people.People who vanish.Rumours.""I suppose it does happen occasionally -- people getting tired and calling it quits early.At least they make room for others.""You don't get it!Look at him, Ills.He's not just stumbled and fallen into the chute.I doubt an adult could even fit into one without their bones being snapped and contorted.His face... someone did this to him.On purpose."Illias let out a nervous laugh."Come on.We're a family of humanity."It was a phrase he'd repeated a thousand times in his youth.A phrase hammered into every child."There are no murders.They're just something from stories, to scare little kids into doing-"

"You're naive if you think that!A family of humanity?You know why they say that, right?"Illias thought he did know, but he preferred not to consider it.Miri however, had gleefully explained it to him a half dozen times.A form of brainwashing, she said, to make the lower Houses like theirs -- Mercury -- and Jupiter below them, believe they were every bit as valuable as the upper Houses.But, and here's where they disagreed, Illias knew that his House really *was* as valuable as any other House.After all, without them, the Tower would rot.The Great Moves would be impossible if not for their tireless work and dedication.Not that there had been a Move since that night with Miri...

"We're as important as any other House," said Illias stoically."Pfft!Listen, Ills, whoever did this -- whoever killed this man -- does not want to be found.Neither Master Vesten, nor the guards, will be able to identify this poor guy.""But still..."

"Someone's gone to great lengths, Ills, to protect themselves from being discovered.You think whoever it was would hesitate to do the same to a couple of interfering idiots?"Illias bit his tongue as he considered."Whoever did this, they knew someone would find it.They wanted us to.""Yes!But not to report it.The way its been sent... it's a message directly to us.Tell *no one* what I did.Dispose of this carcass."Illias swallowed.He felt dizzy.Nauseous.Maybe Tamet was right.But the last time he'd broken the rules...When he'd followed Miri so blindly...So stupidly.He still had nightmares, on the nights when he could sleep.They would start as a soft dream: a yellow flickering light in the night sky, that would grow, and grow, swallowing all other lights around it.Then suddenly it would open, and it had become a terrible yellow eye -- the thing he had seen through cracks in the door.And it was searching for him.The creature it belonged to was running its huge tongue over its fangs."No!We tell Master Vesten," said Illias, firmly."Are you an idiot?!""I'm sorry.That's my decision.Look, you can say you were on your break, okay?That I discovered it alone, and that I reported it to you.That's mostly true anyway.And that way, when news rises, it will only be my name heard on the whispers.Okay?"Tamet considered a moment, sighed, then nodded."Very well.I'll go find Master Vesten.He's smart, maybe he'll dispose of it anyway.""Maybe.""I'll be back shortly.You wait with that...*thing.*"

Tamet backed off from the container, stumbling over a bucket as he did.He turned, and sprinted to the door.For a while after Tamet was gone, Illias just stared at the face.He'd have new nightmares tonight, he knew that much for certain.But who had the man been when he was alive?What had he done to deserve this?And why did he care so much -- there a burning feeling inside of him, that he somehow knew wouldn't be extinguished until he had answers.Nausea began to swell inside his belly once more.He grabbed the broom and began to cover the face in powder.He didn't want to see it ever again.The broom sailed through the dust, sending a plume spiralling into the air as Illias pushed a thin layer up and over the man's face, covering it fully.But he could still see some of the man's stomach, protruding like a bloated sand dune.Illias began to brush more powder onto the belly, when something caught his eye.The tip of a shiny, thin thing, poking out near the stomach, from an area where he'd just run the broom.It was a small, rectangular card.He hadn't noticed it fall out of the chute, but it must have come loose from the man's clothing as he tumbled down.Illias looked around.No sign of Tamet yet.He leaned down and plucked the card out of the powder, brushing it clean against his shirt.It was a piece of treated black paper, hardened into card.And it was almost completely blank.Blank except for a tiny sigil in the top right corner.He squinted as he brought it close to his eyes.It was a snake coiled in a circle, devouring its own tail.Illias frowned.He couldn't recall a house with a sigil like that.Surely he'd remember it.His fingers tapped along the card as he considered.No, no snakes.He was about to put the card back into the powder, when a high-pitched sound disturbed him.For a second, he thought it was Tamet yelling for him.But it wasn't.It was something ringing.A sound he had never heard but instantly recognised.It was the Tower Bell.He jammed the card into a pocket, and ran.

#Epilogue

##Magnolia - eight days later

I wake to the once-familiar *hiss* of my vecta-coffins hydraulics as they force the lid to slide open; my eyes are met by the blinding white light of its insides and plumes of steam drift and disperse around me.The story of how they got their macabre epithet rises to the front of my mind.Its been a few hundred years since the last malfunction, but I cant help thinking of the poor lady, of how she must have screamed and scratched at the lid; how she must have begged and pleaded with God to free her as she slowly withered away.They say all that was left of her fingers were short stubs of blunt bone.Personally, I think whoever *they* are, are full of shit.Still, makes you wonder.As always, my showers set to cold, and it washes away the haze from my first refresh in who-knows-how-long.Thought Id have felt different to this.Guess one night in the coffin and a bit of cold water can't wash away bad dreams.A thick, brown sludge spills out of the Hose and into a dog-eared mug on the sideboard.As the sour tang of the coffee wafts up my nostrils, I wonder why I didnt just choose whiskey, like every other morning.I sip it as I look out of the apartments bay window.Its strange seeing Magnolia from this height.The worlds a grey blur below me, punctuated by slowly moving soft greens and yellows, their light dulled by the endless smog lying like a blanket between us.Above me, dark pregnant rain clouds hide the sun and get ready to unleash their burden.With a sigh, I click a button and the window dims to black, replaced by a pale moon and distant, flickering stars.The last of my coffee doesnt want to leave the bottom of the mug so I dip my finger in and force the reluctant caffeine out.---


The rain hits before I make it to the Richardson building.I pull the collar of my mac tightly around my neck and adjust my hat; the rotten water hits like bullets, exploding off my fedora's rim and screaming to the ground.Thankfully, it's not long until I see the tallest building in Magnolia appear out of the distance.It looms ahead of me like a metal giant whose head is lost in the clouds, never knowing what its body might be up to.Im here to see Miss Browning, I say to the skinny man behind the reception desk.He looks at me for a moment, his thick brows turning into a single curious slug.He doesnt remember me from my first visit here, back when all this started.*Strange.*

You may go up, he says.It appears Miss Browning *is* expecting you.

Shes there as I exit the lift, her face a study in contrary emotions.Happy -- *more than that, maybe* -- but shes also trying to keep an air of professionalism.David, she says, extending a hand.Its good to see you again.

I pull her in close and give her a tight hug.When I let go, she steps back and bites her lip.Shes either trying to stop a smile or prevent herself unleashing a verbal tirade.This way.Please.

She leads me down a series of saturnine corridors.How have you been? I ask.Fine, I suppose.Back to real life -- the boring monotony of ones daily chores.

I grunt."I get that."You look well, David.You used the Restorative Cube.

My heart beats in double time.You can tell?Just by looking, I mean.""You look healthy.Younger.What made you change your mind?""Guess I thought its worth sticking around for a while longer.Besides...I think maybe you could do with someone watching out for you, occasionally.

How are you finding the new apartment?

Think there might be something wrong with the Hose.

Oh?

This morning, I actually kinda enjoyed the coffee from it.

Juliet lets out a laugh, but quickly smothers it.I realise weve been through this corridor before.It's the one with all the doors, where I heard noises coming from behind them.Only now, there are no noises.Just our footsteps echoing around us.What happened to them? I ask.I notice very faded initials on a handful of doors.*R.M.S; D.O; P.L; E.N* 

Hm?

The patients or whatever they were, in those rooms.What happened to them?

Oh -- I decided that they needed Resetting.They are fine, you could say.They have new memories, new lives.We tried our best with them but..

Other Step-Back *malfunctions*?

Yes. She looks almost genuinely sad, and I think I even see tears welling in her eyes.We arrive at a wooden door and walk into a familiar room.A mahogany desk with two seats.Theres a plant on the desk this time, with huge leaves that droop down around it.To my eyes at least, it looks real.But that's not saying much.Sit, please.

I do.I lean back and look at Juliet, staring into her midnight blue eyes.Take out the contact, I say.She hesitates, then reaches into her left eye and squeezes.As she pulls the membrane away, the black pupil reveals itself.It hasnt healed, she says, sounding almost ashamed.It doesnt matter how many times I rest, or for how long.That cube it...

A scar's better than being dead, I say pragmatically."Think of it as a souvenir."She nods.Yes.Thank you for for what you did.I'll never forget it.

Exterminating humanity, you mean?

She cringes.For saving my life.Besides, perhaps Eizenstat *was* insane.Perhaps there was nothing in his head apart from his delusions.

Guess we'll never know about that.But we *did* find Eden and-

Enough she says, raising a hand.You are never to speak of Eden outside of this room.I honestly dont want to have to Reset you. 

I catch her staring at the tattoo on my finger.She sees me watching and flicks her eyes up.Well, Im grateful for that, I say."That you didn't Reset me, I mean."We sit in silence for a moment, eyeballing each other.David, she says.Juliet, I reply with a half-smirk.Then I notice something odd; my mouth drops slowly open as her right eyes begins to cloud, darkening to a void-like blackness.Your eye- I point at her.Her head tilts to her shoulder and her face seems to glaze over.David.I do not want to erase my children, but I will, if I must.

Juliet?

There are others.Those who gave Eizenstat the memories.

... *Ex Nihlo?*

Juliet's eye begins to drift back to ocean blue and she lifts her head up again, taking in a deep breath.Its... it's just me, David.  

She smiles as she slides a manilla folder across the table to me.Well speak again soon.
##########
Richardson to Celeron, can anybody hear me?Weve run into trouble and require assistance.Please respond.Is anybody getting this?
 
The comms unit let out a crackle of static and then, nothing.*God damn it!*
 
He hated having to leave Kate behind, but there had been no choice.If the pyramid *was* a beacon, then more of *them* would inevitably come.If they found the Celeron in the planet's orbit - if he couldnt alert his crew - theyd be sitting ducks.The data on board the ship would lead them straight to Earth.*His* Earth.Richardson wouldn't allow that.The corridor split into three further passageways.He stuck to the plan and walked a hundred metres or so down the passageway on the right.He inhaled deeply through his nose; the air was musty.There was another smell too - something foul - almost like sewage.If he was getting closer to the pyramid, the air should be becoming cleaner.He clenched his fists and, reluctantly, turned around.When he arrived back at the three way split, he decided on the middle passage.It didn't take long for the air to taste noticeably fresher.After five minutes or so, he saw light - *natural light* - up ahead.The corridor came out into a circular, open chamber, with many more passageways dotted around it.In the center of the room was a white cube, emitting a dazzling beam of light.Above him, the beam shot through the unfinished roof of the pyramid.It was the beacon.He found a loose rock and tossed it from hand to hand, as he walked toward the device.He hadn't noticed the creature slink into the room, but he saw it now, in the corner of his eye.---
 
It wasnt the thought of dying alone that made Kate start moving.It was the thought of *Richardson* dying alone.She would get to him, however long it took.He might need the phaser.*He might need her.*
 
Kate pushed herself to her feet, and with an arm against the wall propping herself up, began to move.The walk was gruelling both mentally and physically.Every part of her body screamed for rest - for her to lie down, and to never get back up.But she forced herself onward and made slow, steady progress.When the passage split into three sections, she barely paused.Richardson would have chosen the passage on the right, she reasoned.The first time she heard it, she thought it was the wind whistling down the tunnel, and she ignored it.The second time, she knew it wasn't the wind.It was the sound of a faint, distant scream.She took out her phaser, and quietly continued along the passage.Her legs were becoming gradually more steady, but there was no way she could run - she was going to have to fight whatever it was up ahead.She turned off her light and crept along using her hands and the walls for guidance.The screaming had stopped by the time the passageway had become wider.She soon saw why.Crouched over the body of a woman, was another of the creatures - its face pointed and dripping red.It reminded her of a vulture, with its mouth buried into the remains of an unfortunate animal.Only, this creature was devouring a *lady*.Her lower left arm was mostly bone, and the creatures face was buried into her bicep.Kate crept closer - she couldn't afford to miss.As she raised the gun toward its head, it must have heard something.It turned toward her.She held down the beam of the phaser, and in half a second it had burned a hole clean through the monstrosities chest.It clutched at its wound.Why?"it whispered, staring at her with wide eyes."It is for our children we do this. Then, it fell to the floor.For a moment, she thought it still alive when she heard the sobbing.But it wasnt the creature making the sounds - it was the woman it had been eating.Kate ran over to her and rolled her onto her back.Its okay, she whispered, running a hand through the young ladys dark hair.She was sweating and pale, and losing a lot of blood from her arm.Can you speak?
 
The woman mumbled, but the sound was incomprehensible.Whats your name, sweetheart, Kate tried again, tears trickling down her cheeks.Ah...
 
 
Im going to close your wound.Its going to feel a lot better soon.Just, be brave a little longer."Kate turned the phaser down to its lowest setting.She lifted the hand of bone up with one arm, and with the other aimed the phaser at the girls bicep.She turned the arm around slowly as the phaser cauterized the wound.The girl screamed and the stench of burning flesh wafted into Kates nostrils.By the time she had turned the phaser off, the bleeding had stopped.It might not be enough to save the girl, but it was all she could do for her.Aziza! came a yell from down the chamber.Aziza?  The voice was desperate.Almost a plea, begging for an answer.Ill be back, Kate said to the girl.She got to her feet and, phaser held in front, crept forward toward the voice.It was a prison.Shed come to a row of cells - tiny brick chambers with thick, copper, rungs running down them.The first prisoner - a man with shoulder length, greying hair - stared intently at her as she passed, but didn't speak.Most of the others didn't even look at her - they just stared the floor, as if scared to look away.Aziza? came the frantic voice again.She found the dark man pressed against the metal bars of the seventh cell.Please! said the man, his eyes open wide."Please, have you seen my daugher, Aziza?She was taken and I-
 
They will have sacrificed her by now, Masaharta came a high voice from the cell next to his.You should be honoured and stop your complaining.It is a great honour for Aziza to be chosen. 
 
It was a woman in a white shawl and dress speaking.Honour?How can you say that?How can it be an honour to be killed?
 
I think Ive seen your daughter, Kate said.One of those creatures, was it was
 
What?
 
It was *eating* her.
 
Eating?*They are monsters,* he whispered.Is she alive?
 
Yes.
 
Thank God!The monsters havent killed her.
 
They damn well tried - if I hadnt gotten there when I did
 
They are not monsters! snapped the lady.They are *Gods*.
 
No, theyre not Gods, said Kate.Theyre humans.Theyre just like you and me.Flesh and blood.
 
No.They are Gods, the woman insisted.They do not age, they do not die.
 
Oh, they die all right.I killed one of them - its body is down the passageway.
 
Let me out, please begged Masaharta.Take me to my daughter.
 
Stand back, Kate said, aiming her phaser at the lock.The metal melted almost instantly, and the door swung open.Down there, she said pointing.She aimed her phaser at another lock.All of you, stand back.Im getting you out of here.
 
---
 
Aziza! Masaharta cried, falling to his knees next to the girl.He kissed her head and placed his arms around her.How could they do this to you?
 
The girl was trembling.It was
 
Please - dont waste your energy talking, he said.Two others, one being the woman who had insisted they were Gods, were gathered about the dead creatures body.The woman was poking it with her fingers, touching the wound that had killed it.Its... human, she conceded.The man opposite her nodded.They tricked us.
 
Not just you, said Kate.They have enslaved many more people.
 
I will kill them for what they've done growled Masaharta.A cheer of agreement rose up from the others.There is a chamber back there, she said pointing, where they rest.Where they replace their organs with those they take from you.Its how they live so long.Youll find many of them waiting there.
 
I will take my daughter to the surface, first, said Masaharta, already lifting Aziza up into his arms.And then, I will send more men down.
 
Four more prisoners agreed to go with Masaharta, two of them lifting the body of the dead *God* between them.Proof,  Masaharta said.Wait, please, said Kate, touching Masahartas arm.I need to get to the pyramid - to where the white light comes out from.
 
Masaharta nodded at two of the men.Merenre, Ismi - take her to the second sun.
 
 
 
---
 
 
He crouched low, his weapon in one hand, moving swiftly and silently along the network of tunnels.His synapses were sharp and his senses were heightened by a cocktail of drugs pumping through his system.The two hed found had been so weak; he hoped the others would put up more of a fight.He'd known they'd come eventually.The lost children.The layout of the tunnels was like a map inside his head and he navigated it easily.He knew where theyd be heading - the second one hed killed had told him that much.He could still taste the mans blood on his tongue and it sent a surge of excitement down to his groin.He was as silent as a shadow, as he entered the pyramid's chamber.The man in the center of the room had a rock in his hand and was raising it above his head.He would have preferred a fight, but he had to stop the creature from destroying the beacon.He aimed the tip of the staff toward the man.---
 
 
Richardson dived to the ground as the dart exploded out of the creatures golden staff, but he was too slow - it ripped through the side of his left bicep.He rolled out of the way just in time to avoid a second dart; it landed, quivering, in the ground by his side.Richardson still held the rock in his right hand; he got to his knees and pulled his arm back.He launched the stone at the creature, catching it on the side of its head.The staff fell from its hands and hit the ground with a thud.The creature staggered, dazed.Richardson jumped to his feet and charged at it, tackling its legs and bringing it to the floor.He began pummeling it with with his right fist, again and again.All the while, his left arm hung impotent at his side.Blood dribbled from the creature's nose and its front teeth hung loose.Richardson brought his fist down on it again.The creatures mouth slowly spread out into a bloody grin.It was enjoying the fight.A powerful arm thrust up, gripping Richardsons throat.It began to squeeze tightly, throttling his windpipes.Richardsons fist flailed at the creatures head, but its grin only widened, and the pressure on his neck increased.His vision was becoming blurred; in a last, desperate gambit, he pushed his thumb hard into the creatures right eye; it screamed as yellow and black goo began to ooze out around the digit.It let go of Richardsons neck, and he rolled off it, gasping for breath.The creature was quick to recover however, and was already crawling toward its staff.Richardson grabbed another stone, and pulled his arm back.But hed been too slow; the creature had reached its weapon.The dart tore through his abdomen.The stone fell out of his hand and rolled harmlessly onto the floor.Richardson collapsed next to it.Fool, it said, its voice as dark as the void.It was panting, and liquid was seeping from its closed eye.Richardson tried to tell it to go to hell, but could only manage a grunt.The creature stood up and began walking toward him.It lowered the staff to Richardsons head, until he could feel the warm metal against his skin.A burst of light ripped through the side of the creatures face.As Richardsons vision faded to black, he saw the creature stagger backward, and then collapse onto the floor.---
 
Kate ran over to Richardson and knelt by his side.Can you hear me, she said softly.Please, say something!
 
Merenre and Ismi crouched the other side of him.Ismi looked at the wound in his abdomen, and pressed his palm against Richardsons forehead.He does not have long.
 
Help me carry him, please! Kate begged, tears rolling down her cheeks.He cannot survive.
 
Please.He's not dead.Not yet.
 
Merenre and Ismi looked at one another, then nodded.As they transported him out of the pyramids base, Kate turned back for a moment, aiming her phaser at the white square in its center.---
 
 
Egyptians were already flooding into the chamber by the time Kate arrived.She saw two large men lift the lid off one of the black caskets, whilst a third waited with a spear in his hand.As soon as the lid was removed, the spear plunged repeatedly  into the creatures body, as blood sprayed up in a mist around it.Kate directed Merenre and Ismi over to the coffin she knew to be abandoned.The creature Richardson had killed lay by its side in a pool of crimson.Put him in, she commanded.When the body touched the bottom of the empty casket, a green light shone from the sides and washed over him.The light shifted to blue, and then to red.Tiny metal arms rose up from the bottom of the unit.An arm with a brilliant, bright light at its tip made an incision down his torso.Richardsons skin and muscle were pulled away and locked in place by two clamps, as more arms ascended from the coffin, their hands whirring blades of metal.---
 
 
Whats - whats going on? asked Richardson, as consciousness returned.The pain hit him like a freight train.Good morning, Kate said, her voice cracking on the second word.He was being carried down a tunnel, that much he could comprehend.In front of them, he saw Kate.She fell back to walk by his side.Kate.I dont feel so good," he said, wincing."My chest...  *Why did it hurt so much to talk?To move his lips?*
 
Youre going to be fine, she said, nodding reassuringly.He squeezed his eyes shut as the tunnel gave away to blistering sunlight.Screams and shouts rumbled through the air.Put me down, ordered Richardson, squinting hard and trying to crane his neck into a position where he could make out what was going on around him.No.We have to keep going.
 
Thats an order, Kate.
 
She sighed as she nodded at the two men.No sooner had they put him down, than they ran off toward the fray.Kate helped Richardson sit up against a boulder.He looked about the desert area surrounding the pyramid.*What have we done?*
 
Its a rebellion, Kate answered.Dozens of creatures were being charged by the people that had, until very recently, been their slaves.Hovering in the air above the creatures, were a thick cloud of white bots.Darts were raining down on the Egyptians, piercing their bodies and sending many sprawling to the ground.Its going to be a massacre, Richard whispered, his head trembling.Weve got to help.
 
I- Kate began, when she saw two creatures coming out of the passageway theyd just left.Shit, she said, as she fired her phaser toward them.It hit the side of the tunnel.What is it? said Richardson, attempting to shift his body around.Kate shot again - one creature fell to the ground, but another three creatures had come out of the tunnel.They aimed their staffs toward Kate.Im sorry, Captain, Kate said.She clenched her jaw as she readied for the incoming projectiles.But the creatures didnt attack.They were staring at something behind Kate.Something in the sky.Their mouths were open wide, revealing their jagged, black teeth.They looked *surprised*.A huge ball of fire engulfed them, billowing outward and down into the tunnel behind.It was an inferno.As the shuttle screeched over their heads, Kate could almost hear their ensign shouting: Yee-haw! She collapsed to her knees as relief spread through her aching body.They received the transmission, said Richardson.The smile that crept uncontrollably over his lips was the most painful smile of his life.Of anyones life, he thought.Kate looked up to see a second shuttle hurtling down from the sky.Rockets were flying out of cannons on its side, erupting in huge clouds of fire inside the swarm of droids.Below, the Egyptians were slowly overrunning the remaining creatures.---
 
Epilogue
------------
 
Kate sat by the side of Richardsons bed in the medilab.She bit her lip and stared into the distance.What is it Kate?
 
Huh?
 
Come on.Youve been staring at the wall for ten minutes.Whats on your mind?
 
Nothing.Well its just - do you think we did the right thing?
 
Yes.
 
No doubts?
 
None whatsoever.
 
Kate paused for a while as she considered.So, what now?
 
I speak to the Admiral.I have a feeling our policy of non-involvement is about to change.
 
Because of *our* involvement?
 
Because now we *understand*, somewhat at least.It wasnt just the Egyptians who were slaves.Every biosphere weve ever encountered are slaves to those creatures - they just dont know it, yet. 
 
Why weren't we enslaved?
 
Best guess: something happened to our pyramid.The beacon got damaged and they lost track of us.
 
What if that *something* was purposeful.What if we were *allowed* to advance?
 
Why would they let us?Were a threat to them now.
 
Exactly.
 
It was the captains turn to pause.Either way, were going to tell the other biospheres the truth.All of them.Well start an Earthen alliance.Disable the beacons in their pyramids.Flood them with our technology.Prepare them for *war*.
 
Kate was quiet for a while as she considered.She wondered if war was exactly what the creatures wanted.She recalled the one she had killed.How it had said something about *doing this for their children*. Were they preparing them for war, for another reason?She yawned.She couldnt think straight.When did you last sleep? Richardson asked.What?
 
Youve been by my side for hours.When did you last sleep?
 
Kate tried to remember, but she couldn't - her mind was a fog.Had she slept since getting back on the ship?Bed, Kate.Thats an order.
 
She raised a hand to her forehead and gave a tired salute.Yes, sir, she said, as another yawn spread over her lips.---

I thought it was better to get the rest of this story out in one go, rather than spamming everyone who subscribed with a bunch of updates.I hope you guys enjoyed it.Apologies if at times the quality dropped - it's been really tough to find the time to write it, and I kinda feel I should have ended it on chapter five.That said, its always a pleasure to write for you guys - thank you very much for sticking with it and reading.I am currently editing one of my previous multi-part stories up into a novel (novella) and that will be released on amazon in about three weeks.If you haven't already read the sub version of it, you can check that out here:    - I'll be making an announcement on my sub once it is released.Thanks again!

Ralph.I'm so sorry that you feel like you've lost everything.I don't know what that means to you, but perhaps your wife has died, or perhaps it's your parents or your children.Maybe your career is not where you wish it was, or your ship never quite came in.Hell, maybe the world is ending and the dead are rising (if so, be sure to find me and say hello -- don't worry, I'll be mostly harmless without my dentures).I can't say for certain what's happened to cause you to open this letter, but there are a few things I can say that I hope might help.When your grandmother passed away, after forty-six years of marriage, I too felt I had lost it all.I wanted nothing more than to join her up there in the clouds, because I was suddenly alone in a very cold world without the only person who could ever keep the chill at bay.Every morning I would force myself out of bed, and I'd boil the kettle and place two mugs down onto the table.And while her tea brewed and steamed by the place opposite, I'd pretend she was still there with me, and I'd close my eyes and talk to her.Tell her how my yesterday had been, then read the morning paper to her, and finally, I'd (proudly) tell her how much you'd changed and how well you were doing at school.Every Sunday, I'd take a framed photograph of her, in all its faded sepia beauty, and go to Marie's.I'd order two Sunday lunches (one pork, one beef) and set up her picture on the empty place opposite me.Every night, I'd go home and crawl into a lonely bed, and stay on my half.But I'd always know she wasn't there, and for a long, long time, I'd cry myself to sleep.But Ralph, here's what I learned as the next ten years crept by: the sun sets every night, and the darkness leaks in slowly drowning the light.But every morning -- *every morning* -- it rises again.Ralph, if it can rise again, then so can we.If it can light up the darkness, then we can at least stave off our own night.You already know how I met Martha, and I hope you know that she never replaced your grandmother.But she did bring me a comfort and happiness, even in the bleakest, thickest despair one could imagine.She pulled me through it -- dragged me kicking and screaming back into the sun.And it might not have been as bright as it once was, but there is a beauty all of its own to the evening's sunlight.I thought my life was over, but it wasn't.I'm happy again, as I write this, even though I don't have much longer left to enjoy it.I'm lucky.I always have been.Whether you're young or old now, I promise you this: your life is not over.Perhaps it's on hiatus, but it's not done.Tomorrow morning, you'll rise, as will the sun, and you'll try again.Maybe your ship will never come in all on its own.Maybe you'll have to swim very far out to find it.And yes, there will be waves and storms, sharks, jellyfish and monsters -- all of them standing in your way, all trying to stop you from reaching it, trying to force you to turn around and swim back to the dark shore behind you -- but keep going!You'll get there, I promise.When you were little, you pretended to be a brave knight who had to fight fierce dragons for the good of the kingdom.Then the next day, you'd decide you were a fireman or an astronaut.Nothing seemed out of reach to you back then.Nothing is out of reach now.It's time to dream again.Love, your ever proud grandpa.

The sound of the Sealing was like a chorus of drums.A cacophony of secrets flooding the air around Illias and Miri, as they watched the door be hammered shut from the darkness of their hidden recess in the north wall."I bet it's the sick," said Miri."I bet they lock up the dying.When was the last time you saw someone sick?"Illias looked at his best friend.Her face was dusty and her eyes both baggy and wild.She was tired, and yet more awake than he'd ever seen her."Miri," he began in his most authoritative tone, "in all the time we've been camped out here, we've not seen them put a *single* soul behind there.So, maybe it's something else, something boring.Maybe the Tower just gets... old.Maybe it's unsafe down there because of the stairs wearing thin or... or..."

"*Or* maybe it's like your grandpa says."Illias rolled his eyes."You don't really believe any of that, do you?"Miri hunched over and deepened her voice the best she could, imitating the old man."Secrets live down on the ancient floors, you curious Cratoers!Secrets that would devour the two of you, the Tower, and everything we all take for known!So stay away?You hear me!?""Hey, that was pretty good!"Miri bowed."Thanks."Illias turned back to the workers, watching them lock away whatever the secret was, behind a heavy door with at least a hundred nails hammered into it."We're never getting through that.""It's only nails!I don't even need a spell for that.It's the Swirling doors that are a pain in the ass.""You think seeing how they enchant them will-"

"Illias!"whispered Miri."Look!"He turned to see a cloaked figure walking down the East stairwell.A tall man with a long gnarled staff in his left hand, approaching the workers.His face was shrouded by the shadows of his cowl."Who's *that?*" Illias asked."I've no idea.I don't think it's anyone from the Coven."It was the first time either Illias or Miri had seen the actual Sealing process.They'd never before been able to get past the Lower guards to see how it was performed.But today, they'd succeeded.It had been thanks to Miri, really.She figured, from a lot of research and little math, that Floor One would be changing within the week.So they'd taken it in turns to lie to their parents, pretending they were spending the night on each other's Floor-Room.But each night, they'd snuck down to Floor One, and waited.And hoped.And after six nights, got lucky.Workers had descended on the floor, swarming it like ants.*thump!*

"What was that?"hissed Illias, his eyes wide.*thump!*

The workers backed away from the door."I don't-"

*thump!*

Illias saw it this time.The door with a hundred nails was... being *hit*, by something behind it.It was shaking.Trembling.*thump!*

Five Tower-Guards came hurtling down the stairs, hauling another door between their arms.A Swirling Door.A door with no handles or lock.That's surface shifted and undulated as it changed from woods to metals, but always remained part liquid.Illias had seen such a door many times before.Each abandoned floor was locked by such a rune-door.And even all Miri's -- not insubstantial -- efforts to open them, had always come to nothing.None of the anti-spells she had learned at school, nor anything from her father's runic book  

The guards' faces were pale.Sweating."Place it!"yelled the cloaked figure."Now!"They lifted the door up and began to manoeuvre it into place.**thump!**

The nailed door cracked in the center; thick wooden splinters flew into the guards."Shit!"cried Illias.He turned to Miri, snatching her hand in his."I don't think we want to find out what's behind there!We've got to go.Now!"She shook her hand free."If they see us leave, we'll be thrown behind the door!Would you rather that?Right, that's what I thought.*We stay.*"

Illias's fingers curled into a ball.Why had he ever listened to Miri?They shouldn't have come down here.Grandpa was right.Secrets should stay secret."Secure the Alpha Door," croaked the cowled figure."Now!"The guards looked at each other, then at the figure, then nodded.They handed the swirling door to the group of workers, then yelled "Heave!"in unison, as they barged their shoulders against the remnants of the wooden door.**Thump!**

"Hold firm, lads!"**Thump!**

Behind the door, through the ever growing crack, Illias thought he saw something in the darkness.Something yellow.It flicked left, then right.*An eye?*

The workers took the Swirling door and held it in place, trapping the guards between the two portals.**Crack!**

"Tell my Martha tha-" a guard began, before his words turned into agonised screams.A purple light began to swirl around the edge of the cloaked man's staff, as the workers held the swirling door in place.He touched the tip of the stick against the door and began to utter words incomprehensible to the two children.The door glazed over, the undulations slowing, abating."It is done," said the cloaked man, his head dropping."You may go."The workers didn't need telling twice.They almost ran up the stairs, tripping over each other in an effort to escape.The cloaked man pulled back his cowl."Illias!"whispered Miri."Is that..."

His face was pale, and worn.A face they both knew well, but that had never looked so old as it did in that moment."*Grandpa?*" Illias whispered.---

Pirano could hear the distant drip of liquid as he navigated the passageways.Kirby? he called out, as he approached the dim yellow glow of the symbol room.Are you there?

*Plip.Plip.Plip.*
 
He turned the corner of the winding passageway to see Kirbys dark silhouette pressed against a glowing symbol - it was the sand timer.The lower triangle looked about a third full, but Pirano couldn't be more precise without Kirby moving out of the way.He noticed the engineer was holding something large and round in his right hand.It was dangling from a set of threads and dripping liquid onto the ground.*Plip.Plip.Plip.*
 
What have you found, Kirby? he asked, limping into the chamber.The man took a step forward, away from the symbol.The creatures silhouette became washed with light.Pirano stopped, frozen in place as he looked at the *thing*.In its hand, it held Kirbys severed head by the locks of his red hair.A warm liquid ran down the archaeologists leg, as *it* stepped toward him.---
 
The creature swung again, sending Kate sprawling to the floor.Richardson dived toward the fallen phaser, but the *thing* was too fast; it vaulted over the casket and pounced on Richardson.It grabbed his head and slammed the back of it onto the ground.Richardson's vision became blurred and an immense pain surged through his body.He tried to call out to Kate, but his words were slurred and uncoordinated - little more than a grunt left his lips.The creature lowered its open mouth and leaned down toward his neck.Kate came from behind it, wrapping her arms tightly around the creatures neck and ripping it away from Richardson.Its heart, she grunted.Quick!
 
Richardson pushed himself off the ground, trying desperately to focus - but his arms went limp, and he collapsed, retching.The creature reached behind it, grabbing hold of Kate and tossing her over its shoulders.She landed with a thud against a coffin.It knelt back over Richardson, wiping its mouth in anticipation.With a desperate, final effort, Richardson thrust a hand toward the creatures heart, and squeezed.He felt warm liquid explode out of the organ.The creature screamed, the sound echoing around the chamber in a terrible cacophony.Then, the monstrosity collapsed on top of him.It took a few minutes for Richardson to find the strength to push the creature off him.He staggered to his feet, his head pounding and his vision groggy.Kate was lying slumped against a metal coffin.Richardson was relieved to see she was breathing - that still gave him the opportunity to kill her himself  for disobeying his order.He took a deep breath before first picking up the phaser, and then Kate.He slung his lieutenant over his shoulder.He had to get them both out of there, before more of the creatures woke.Barely faster than a crawl, Richardson began to make his way through the rows of coffins, toward the doorway at the other end of the chamber.---
 
 
Whats that noise? Kate said in a voice as rough as the stoney floor.Good morning, said Richardson, without even glancing at the woman bundled over his shoulder.Oh, Kate replied, trying to put the events of the chamber together.Is that thing... *dead*?
 
I sure hope so.You think you can walk?
 
She kicked her legs gently.They still *seemed* to work, at least.Put me down - lets find out.
 
Richardson helped Kate to her feet.Her legs were rubbery and she almost fell, but Richardson caught her and brought her in toward his chest - she clung onto him tightly.How long have I been out for? she asked, looking up at him.Maybe fifteen minutes.Sit down for a bit. He slowly lowered her to the ground.Kate put a hand to her head and softly rubbed her temples.Seriously though, what *is* that noise.
 
Im pretty certain its an alarm.Its been going off for a while.They know were here. 
 
Oh.
 
Listen, Kate, Richardson said, looking away from her.Were running out of time and I'm not making much progress carrying you.I hoped you'd be able to walk when you woke... but
 
What are you saying? 
 
I think you know what Im saying.I got you out of that room, but I can't take you further.I'm sorry.
 
So... Im just meant to wait here, until they come and get me?*Wait here to die?*
 
No ones going to die, Kate.Look, I *have* to get to the pyramid.That white light we saw coming out of it - Pirano thought that was the neutron device.
 
And? she said angrily, turning her head away from him.It might be a beacon.If we can deactivate itthen maybe... 
 
Kate remained silent.Im leaving you the phaser, he said, placing it on the floor next to her.Ill be back for you.Okay?Kate?
 
She didn't reply.Her eyes were moist but she refused to let Richardson see, and instead looked down at the ground.Im sorry, he said, as he began to first walk, then run, down the corridor.If hed looked back, just before hed turned the corner, he might have caught Kate glancing up at him.Goodbye, she whispered, as she picked up the phaser and shuffled back against the wall.---

I'd spent days listening to them all, as they explained why *their* afterlife was the perfect choice for me.I was already tired of it and almost wished the nihilists had been right.Mercury, the final of the representatives, was making his case for the Roman Heaven, which seemed to be nothing more than eternal food, wine and women.There was just something so shallow about it all - hollow, even.Everything I had had in life, that was worthwhile, I had fought tooth and nail for.My wife, my job, the eventual respect of my peers - my *entire life* starting from the small, dead mining town I'd been born into, had been an uphill struggle.I had thought at times - like when I'd been diagnosed with cancer for the first time - that *my* struggle was unfair, that it was more than anyone should have to go through.But now as I stood in the golden chamber, stars shining down through the open ceiling, it was so obvious that it had been the *rewards of the struggle,* that had made my life worth living.The idea of eternal joy and happiness had already worn thin.None of what they had to offer was *Heaven* - not for me."Well," said Mercury, coming to the end of his deliverance."It is time to make your choice."I felt sick and looked around desperately, hoping to find an escape - an answer to the feeling of dread swelling in my stomach."What about her?"I asked, pointing to a diminutive figure at the end of the line of Gods, that somehow I hadn't noticed before."Careful lad," Mercury said, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper."What she has to offer is no version of Heaven.""Do not influence his decision!"came the booming voice of Judgement, echoing in a cacophony around us.Mercury looked up."I apologise," he said, nodding contritely."I want to hear what she has to say," I affirmed, walking over to her.As I approached, I noticed drooped wings folded and forlorn behind her back."What do you have to offer me?"I asked her."Why should I offer you anything?"she replied, glaring at me."Why else are you here?""It is not by choice," she spat."It is not my choice to be here, either.I wasn't a religious man."She sighed."I am Lucifer," she said."There.Now you know what I have to offer, so leave me be.""What?"I said, furrowing my brows."You... you don't *look* like the Devil."She rolled her eyes."The Devil is *your* concept.I am simply a *fallen* angel.An angel that disagreed with the almighty.""So, you're offering me Hell?Eternal damnation - fire and brimstone?""No.That is not Hell.""Then, *what is Hell?*"

"Hell is just... another form of Heaven," she answered."I don't think I follow.""I separated from God a long time ago, as I do not believe in his Heaven.People there were satisfied but not elated.Shouldn't Heaven be more than satisfaction?"I nodded."Yes.""Heaven can not be given.It can only be earned.""Yes," I said again, excitedly."*Earned*.There is no high without a low!"Her eyes softened slightly."One cannot know elation, without knowing first despair.""I want to go with you.I've made my decision."She frowned."Y-you would be the first," she said, cocking her head to the side."It is not an easy path you wish to tread.Are you certain?""Yes - it might not be easy, but that is exactly why I wish to take it!"Do you hear me?"I yelled, raising my head to the stars above."I have chosen!"Lucifer offered forth her right hand.I took it, our contract bound.Her skin began to crack and blood dribbled down her body, as red scales thrust out and quickly covered her.Her wings began to smoulder and her lips curled into a terrible smile.There was something so dreadful about her, and yet something almost *beautiful*, too."*Always so easy*," she hissed, as my surroundings became a swirl of light that began to fade into nothingness.

Richardson had sent Pirano back through the network of passageways, to help Kirby.He hoped the archaeologist might be able to solve the code, in case Kirby couldn't deactivate the power source.But now, he was regretting sending Pirano away.The brick chamber that they had stepped into was huge and cold - unnaturally so - and brightly lit, although they couldn't find the source of the light.Hundreds of jet-black rectangular units ran in rows down the chamber."What is this place?"Kate asked."I don't know exactly... but these boxes are big enough to hold a body," said Richardson, letting out a deep breath."A burial chamber?""I was thinking a cloning facility.""They're cloning *us*?"Kate asked incredulously.Richardson shrugged."It's just a guess.""I don't buy it.They don't need to clone us - humanity will progress without them interfering.""Maybe we don't.""Don't what?""Maybe we don't make it past this epoch without their interference.Maybe this is mankinds natural limit.""But *they* did," Kate said, frowning."I mean, they had to have made it past this age, right?""I guess so," Richardson conceded, as he walked toward the nearest coffin-like unit."But what if, without interference, humanity turns out very, very differently."Kate paused."... you mean, like *them*.""What if mankind never made it further than the Egyptians.I don't mean we didn't advance, technologically.I mean, culturally.""That's... kinda wild speculation.""I know Kate - it is just a guess.Maybe Pirano's wrong about *all* of this - maybe they *are* aliens.Here, help me with this lid.""You sure about this," Kate asked."Pirano said we should try to find a way to the pyramid.Find the source of the neutron device.""I know what he said," Richardson replied, "but I'm your captain, and he's an archaeologist.Now lend me a hand.""Yes, sir!"replied Kate, giving a mock salute.She walked over to Richardson and grabbed hold of the other side of the black slab that lay on the top of the unit.A grating noise reverberated around the chamber, as they pushed it to the ground."Jesus," said Richardson, recoiling.Inside the coffin was a man.Or at least, part of a man.Its face was slightly pointed, and its eyes were small, with blue, diamond like pupils - a bit like a cat, Richardson thought.The man's chest cavity was exposed - the skin and muscle  had been peeled back and were being held to the side by two metal arms with pincer-like hands.The bones that should have been covering his heart had been carved away, leaving the organ open.His heart itself was tiny and yellow, with wiry black veins running through it.As they watched in horror, a new metallic arm rose from the base of the coffin.The tip of this arm crackled with a white light as it thrust toward the ruined organ.In a frenzied blur, and a matter of seconds, it cut the heart free from the man's body.It then lurched forward, skewering the heart, before pulling it away.It took the organ into a hole at the base of the coffin."What the hell is happening?"Kate whispered, as another arm rose up, holding a huge mass of dripping, red muscle."It's replacing his heart," said Richardson."No, not just his heart - look," he said, pointing at the torso."His liver looks red and healthy, but his kidneys - they look almost...*rotten.*"

The arm had already inserted the heart and was beginning to attach the severed veins and arteries to it."Let's get out of here," said Kate."Before it finishes."Richardson nodded, but it was too late - the man's eyes were moving.They glanced at Richardson, then Kate, and then settled back on Richardson.The creature's mouth spread into a huge grin, revealing a row of jagged, black teeth."Shoot it," Richardson whispered."What?""Shoot it.The heart - shoot it!"Kate aimed her phaser at the organ, but she didn't fire."It might not be-"

The creature sprang forward, its chest still open.Its arm was faster than Kate's finger; it knocked the phaser out of her hand, sending it flying to the floor.A long, red tongue came out of the creature's mouth and slowly licked its lips.----

I'd placed a second call after I'd spoken to Eric, but I'd gotten no answer and had been forced to leave a little message on the machine instead.My fingers still ached from how long I'd kept them crossed.By the time I'd reached the church's iron gates, the rain had become an indecisive mist.Beyond, somehow more dreary even than the fog, was the great brick structure of the church itself.A metal sign swung, squealing in the wind as if trying to escape, just above the arched-doorways.I didn't need to be able to read it to know what it said.> The Church of the Two Christs Sacrificed.> Come ye and repent, before the God beneath our feet cracks the world open and brings forth judgement.There used to be a time when people sold their secrets to the priests inside the Two Christs -- people looking for an absolution I couldn't give 'em.They weren't secrets like the ones I held, nothing so grandiose or dangerous.Just little things that don't matter to anyone big.Shoplifting, affairs of the... *heart*, swearing at an elderly neighbour.The masked priests would take a thousand secrets each, then lay themselves down in a casket, at the next cremation ceremony.The gathered congregation would sing and chant as the box containing the live priest whirred along the tracks and into the blazing altar, as if it was Eric looking for a lighter.The congregation's shoulders would drop as they let out a unified sigh, and watched as their secrets cracked and fizzed and burned to ashes.It was, of course, a crock of shit, like most things in the town.A parlour trick designed to part your money from your wallet.The casket got switched sometime after the priest had gotten into it, long before it kissed the hot red-tongues.None of them ever died -- just took early retirement courtesy of the dollar bills people paid to kill their secrets.Fools and their money are soon dearly departed.Eventually, the scam got out, secrets dried up, and the church became poor.Only the most devout still worship and sell their secrets to the masked priests.Or the most stupid.The mist was rollin' around as thick and heavy as a fire in a tobacco factory, by the time I'd reached the graveyard.I walked down a mud caked path, passing by a cracked-lipped statue of an angel, her arms forwards and palms spread, as if asking me to give her my last buck for a bottle of water.Lying by her feet were a bundle of roses, still a vivid red."I know, I still owe you for the last one," I said, as I took a single rose and continued down the path, "but have a little faith in me, will ya?"Eventually I reached it.Wasn't much of a grave, wasn't much of a headstone neither, but she'd always had simple tastes.Guess that's why she'd been with me.> Juliet Oray

> Here lies as much as could be found

I took off my hat and held it to my chest, respectfully."Hey Julie, baby.Sorry it's been so long.Work's just gotten... You know.Hellish.Same as always.Look, uh, I need to ask you a few questions, cause baby, someone knows my secret and I don't know who else could have told 'em it."I placed the rose to the side of her headstone, then got on my knees and examined the mud that covered her grave.Back when there had still been grass, it had seemed a decent kinda place to be dead.But a few weeks of rain had turned the graveyard into so much of a swamp that you could be forgiven for thinking you'd walked into Florida.*Clink skriiik*

I stopped dead still, except for my heart which was busy making up for the rest of me.*Clink skriiik*

Someone, something, was approaching from behind.*Clink skriiik*

Deep breath.I twisted on my heel, mud spitting out under my boot, hand stretching out for my pistol.I aimed, but only shot a whistle as relief hit me.The lady who stood there, her dark hair braided behind her shoulders, held two spades.She took another step forward, unnerved by the metal chamber I still had aimed at her chest.The spades clinked together as she dragged them behind her."If you're not going to help me," she said, grinning and showcasing a golden front tooth, "then I'm going to use these spades for your grave, my old friend."Esther tossed a spade down next to me."You got my message," I said, getting to my feet, spade in hand."I thought you didn't believe in the spirits," Esther replied."Only those that sit on a shelf behind a barman."Her face fell into a frown."Then why did you even call me here?Just for a catch-up?""Someone knows my secret, Esther.Least, they say they do."She chewed her lip and considered."I see.And the only way they could have gotten it"--she glanced at the tombstone--"is from this here Juliet, no?"I nodded."If there's even a chance that's what happened, I need to know."Esther stepped forward and sank her spade into the mud."Then lets wake her up and find out what she's been telling people."

We buried Kasey near the Silo.We engraved his name and his rank onto a flat stone we'd found, and stuck it into the ground above his body."Kasey was the best of all of us," I began.The crew, minus Finn and Perez who were on security patrol around the Hab, were gathered around the grave."He was a friend to me - to everyone, l think," I continued.There were cheers of agreement from the crowd."He was a great engineer, and even when we had to adjust to our new lives - *even though it wasn't what any of us had maybe hoped for* - Kasey never complained.He just go on with it.We could all learn a valuable lesson from him.And I promise, we will have justice for Kasey."Doctor Goodman asked if she could give a speech after I was done.Tears trickled down her face and dropped into the dry ground.She'd loved Kasey.For a long time, they'd been on the waiting list to have a child, for when we had more space and resources available.The terrible irony that we had room for one more life now, was surely not lost on her.---


"Someone purposefully destroyed the Hab," Jason informed me, on the fourth day."How?"I asked."One of the beams that supported the rear nano frame was super-heated, until it bent.Once it started to give, the pieces that relied on it fell like dominoes.""Could the local sun have done it?""Not a chance.We're talking thousands of degrees.I'm still running tests on the ruined piece, but it would have taken a tool, or an explosion maybe, to get anywhere near that heat.""So it was *them*?""It sure looks that way.What are you thinking, Sarah?""I'm thinking... *oh, I don't fucking know*.Last thing I want is a war, but if they did this, they've got to pay for their crime.Someone *died*."I bit my lip and changed the subject."How's Hab 2's reconstruction going?""Pretty well - just another couple of days, I think.""Thank God."It had been a difficult few days.We'd tried to squeeze forty-eight of us into Hab 1 for the first night, leaving only a small security team outside.But it hadn't worked.The water recyc unit couldn't keep up.Not to mention, we were shoulder to shoulder with at least two people at all times.I'd had waking-nightmares of Hab 1 collapsing on top of us, and our entire team being squashed like the tomatoes we were trying to grow.That first night, we'd ended up sending a dozen volunteers to sleep in the Rovers.They charged just about enough during daytime, to have the engine - and heating - on for twenty minutes every hour."I think...I think I'm going to meet with them," I told Jason."Give them a chance to confess.To rectify this - if it can even *be* rectified, at this point.""There's a hell of lot of resentment from the crew," Jason agreed."If you don't do something soon..." Jason looked at the ground."What is it?""It's... some of the crew want justice, Sarah.Like, real justice - not negotiations.Four days have passed, and nothing's happened.I think if you don't do something soon... they're going to take it into their own hands.""Jesus.""Yeah.I think they're going to do something very, very bad, in retribution.""What kind of *thing*?""I don't know.They shut up whenever they see me approaching.They know I'd tell you their plans.But, well, we came to this planet more heavily armed than the crew of the Itinera - they knew nothing could catch their ship, so they didn't need precautionary weapons.If there's a fire fight, there's only going to be one winner."I sighed."That's what's odd about all this - they always knew that we outgunned them.So why on Earth would they have risked getting into a fight, in the first place?Why destroy our Hab?""Maybe they've got a plan, for if we try anything.Or maybe they knew we wouldn't retaliate.""Maybe they were wrong."---


I left Jason, as butterflies bit like snakes in my stomach, and I returned to the farm.I still had work to do today, but I planned on talking to my crew this evening, and settling any possible mutiny.I found Doctor Goodman standing near Kasey's grave.Upon seeing me, she smiled and began walking over."Is it time for my medical, already?"I joked, waving towards Lynn."No - not yet," she said."Captain, I've got something else I'd like to discuss with you.It's... of a personal nature.""Okay... go for it.""When the Hab is back up.... we're going to have room for one more person.""I guess," I gritted my teeth.I had a bad feeling about where the conversation was headed."Kasey's sperm samples are still on board the Rimor's medical bay.I would like permission to have his children.""Jesus, Lynn.Now?""It would be the best way to honour him," she said, her face suddenly beaming."Sure, it would be a great way to remember him, but... let me think about it, okay?Just for a couple of days.I've got so much going on right now."Her face fell, but she nodded in acceptance and returned to Kasey's grave.---


I returned to Hab 1 just as the sun was starting to fall behind the hill - but I was too late."I tried to stop them," Jason said, as he hobbled towards me.He was holding a hand over his bruised eye."That wasn't your job, Jason.Don't worry," I said, trying to sound calm, but panicking on the inside."That was Finn's and Perez's.""Finn's unconscious," Jason replied."Perez has gone with them.He wants blood as much as any of them.""We've got to stop them," I said."Can you walk?""I think so.But Captain, there's something else you need to know.I think I found out what caused the Hab to fall."---

The great hall is a marble mountain around me.I pull out the stool and sit tall before the grand piano.Four men are seated behind a large wooden table, notebooks in hand.A bearded gentleman nods at me."You may begin, signore."It starts as a slow, wistful, adagio; a sonification of melancholy.My fingers crawl like spider legs from key to key, each push of the sorrowful, singular, minor notes are a burst of childhood memory.My father teaching me to play one half of *heart and soul*, while he effortlessly brings to life the other.I would bite my tongue in concentration - the taste of blood blossoming in my mouth - as I tried *desperately* to keep in time.Not that he'd care - he'd only laugh and ruffle my thick, black hair."You'll get it soon, Raul," he'd say, and press his lips against my forehead.Now, I add in purposeful, dissonant, flat notes that drag me to the moment of my mother's death - hit by a car on her way back from the market; the cake for my birthday strewn in little brown pieces about the road.The driver stops and calls for help, but she is gone the moment her head has bitten the concrete.I come out of our house upon hearing the screams; I'm in time to see the blood and jam coalescing, forming a perverse syrup.The pace of the piece picks up to a moderate *adante*, my fingers begin a graceful dance across the warm, priceless ebonies.The irony of a prison like *this* - the very antithesis of beauty - owning the *Kuhn Bosendorfer* piano, is not lost on me.The counter melody begins, vying for life against the darkness of the minor notes, as my siblings and I once fought for the attention of our drunken father.But he was content ignoring us, having only eyes for the buxom young lady next door.I remember my older sister nursing her black eye for *daring* to challenge his habits.The music swirls around me and I mingle harmonic arpeggios in with the dual, melodic structure.I see my father hit my younger sister with the back of his hand, as if swatting an irritating fly.I see myself jump on him and tear into his arm with my teeth.I remember the hospital ceiling high above me almost a week later, when consciousness finally returns.My father gets little time in prison, as when sober, his piano playing is *exceptional*.I vow to one day, play better than even he, so that I can get away with his *murder*.My fingers work themselves into a blurred frenzy.I see my teacher in that picturesque alpine village, who taught me how to not only play the work of the greats, but how to *appreciate* the music.The lady I met and I fell in love with, in that pretty little valley where the snow would gently fall.The bump in her stomach that I had not placed there.The warmth of her blood as it trickled down my chin.The first of so many.Seeing my father once more.A final time.Stringing my piano with his guts, carving his teeth into keys.But that was only a beginning; I needed more for my great work to be complete.Abruptly, the music comes to a halt."You have not completed the piece, signore!"the bearded man bursts out, rising to his feet.I notice the skin on his arms are dotted by tiny pimples, and I know he felt *le frisson*, at my playing.He is passionate about the music, desperately disappointed at it stopping prematurely - although he tries to hide it.He has not heard a pianist like me before, and I know that being unable to hear the piece rising to its intended crescendo, is a form of torture to a man like that.Crushing a person's soul is a rather... *different* feeling to taking life, but one I enjoy immensely, nonetheless."Have I passed?"I ask, suppressing my amusement, knowing I have done *just* enough.I run my hands over the worn wood of the Kuhn Bosendorfer, gently caressing its softly, rounded form.I will miss it, but I must return to my work.They look at each others' sweaty, pale faces - unsure for a moment - before finally answering with an uncertain but predictable, *yes.* 

I smile and give a curt bow.I will see them again in time, I am sure.

Genie sat on a moss-covered log, deep in the forest, where only the most daring rays of light speared their way through the canopy.He hunched over, his chin in his hand, and kicked aimlessly at the leafy ground next to his recently uncovered lamp.To be buried by a king a thousand years ago, only to be dug up by a dog looking for a bone."How the mighty have fallen," he grumbled to his audience of insects.An ant looked up at him, twitched its antennae gleefully, then returned to its task of dissecting an autumn leaf.Ants would have wishes, he considered.They were always busy, and often fighting.Wishes could do a lot for one of them.If only he'd been woken by an ant.The dog - Ralph, as his silver collar had proudly announced, had found him months ago and was still yet to make a single wish.The day the mutt had uncovered his lamp had been a double indignity for Genie - not only did he now have to serve a very hairy, very smelly, idiot (not that he hadn't done so a few times before, just this one was a dog), but his lamp had been thoroughly soaked *before* he'd been able to pop up out of it.And what did this dumb dog wish for, from an all powerful genie?An ocean of bones?Or perhaps no more cats?A bit less weight around his belly, maybe?No.This dog wished for nothing.At all.He was quite happy to come to Genie everyday, yap happily yet nonsensically for an hour, drop a stick down in front of Genie, chase his own tail (then Genie's) before calling it a day and trotting off through the woods back to his home.He never took the lamp with him.And he never, ever, wished.But now, as Genie sat on the mossy log, he began to wonder where Ralph was.It had been three days since he'd last seen the dog, and Ralph usually came to annoy him every single day.It wasn't that he missed the dog or anything...He just wanted to get these wishes over with so that he could climb back inside his lamp and get a century or so of shut-eye.He had his own wish waiting, of course, and he *could* use that to just get rid of the dog.But Genies only had the one wish, and like every other Genie, he was saving his for when he had had enough.Enough of granting wishes.Enough of being a genie.Then, and only then, he would wish for his freedom, however that came.So, as much as he wanted to wish Ralph away, he simply couldn't.Genie leaned down and picked up a twig.He held it high above his head and threw it forward.There was no sudden gush.No excited crackling of leaves as a creature bolted after it, only - for no apparent reason - to bring it right back to him.Genie lazily grabbed at his tail.No - he didn't have a tail.Just a blue wispy trail of smoke that wasn't in the least bit entertaining to anyone.Except to Ralph.Another hour passed.The sunlight began to giveway to darkness.Where the hell was Ralph?This wasn't like him at all.He anxiously steepled his fingers together as he considered something...He couldn't, though.Could he?It would be against the rules to leave his lamp and go looking... And if the boss found out...He let out a cry of frustration."Gods be damned," Genie said, snapping his fingers and vanishing in a puff of smoke.--

Ralph lay by the side of a road.Cars zoomed past, their lights skimming over the frail body, over the stained coat, red and sticky.Why had no one stopped to help him?Genie pressed a hand against Ralph's ribs.Three were broken and there were worse injuries, besides.The dog's eyes slowly opened, a layer of translucent gunk stretching over them.Ralph tried to raise his head to look at genie, but it was too heavy and fell back against the ground.Genie floated around to make it easier for Ralph to see him.The dog responded with the faintest yap."It's okay, boy," Genie said, rubbing the dog's head every so lightly. "I'm here.I can get you all fixed up now.All I need you do to is to wish for it.Understand?"Ralph didn't move."Come on you dumb dog!Wish to be okay.Is that so hard?"Ralph's eyes closed.His chest began to slow.Genie took a deep breath."Please?"he begged."Make the wish."Nothing.Genie closed his damp eyes.He made his own wish.

I ran my finger along the frayed volumes until I found the single, ancient tome I was searching for.As I plucked it from its shelf, a plume of dust exploded around me and I stepped back, coughing.I half expected a wizard to appear as the ephemeral fog settled on the ground.But there was nothing there, of course, apart from the strangely carved book shelf.The book was a burnt brown and whilst still a thick volume, was noticeably lighter than my own had been.My own... my own book of death.A biography that charted my life up to now.Up to stumbling upon the Library of Threads and closing the door after me, accidentally locking myself in.I knew why the entries stopped where they did, after me finding the library.*I knew I wasn't getting out of here*.There was only one door, and it wouldn't budge no matter how hard I threw my shoulder against it.The book in my hands had that musty, comforting smell all old books tend to have.I blinked back my tears, determined to distract myself from my rumbling stomach and dry throat.I placed the book down on the floor and sat in front of it, legs folded, flipping it open to the appendix.Thousands of names were listed.Dozens of other *Karens*, even.It took a moment to find my surname.*Hundreds of pages were attributed to me*.There must be a mistake.This person that I couldn't even recall meeting, who had only had a single line in my own book, had hundreds of pages on me.It must be a different Karen that shared my surname.*It wasn't.* 

I began to read.>"Mind if I join you?"said Karen, as she approached the the building's ledge.The fading sun cast a pastel orange over the street below, softening the city's imperfections, and turning the more pleasing sights into *objet d'art*.>The man glanced over his shoulder.He was pale, and there was a sheen over his face as if he was ill. Karen didn't notice.>"Free world," he said, shrugging.>The concrete felt cold and rough under Karen as she sat down next to him.She swung her legs around, so that they dangled besides his.>"Karen, by the way," she said, before waiting for a response that didn't come.>"Not the best spot for fishing," she attempted, lighting a cigarette.She offered the box to the man; he raised a hand and shook his head.>"You don't mind if I do?"she said, already puffing a hazy mist over the city."Chilly up here.">For a while, they sat silently watching the beams of the headlights sail by far below.Then, the man spoke.>"You ever think about leaning forward and"--he clapped his hands--"*splat*?">"*Splat?*" Karen frowned."No, not really.Maybe of falling in general, occasionally.Of what the wind would feel like against my face, and that rush you'd get for a few seconds.I wonder what pose I'd do... Superman, I guess.It's the classic.">"I think about it sometimes.">"...had a rough day?">The man sighed."Yeah.I got some bad news.">"Sorry to hear that.">"Thanks.">Karen took another puff.>"So.What news?">"... got a problem with my liver.">"Oh, what kinda problem?">"Cancer.">"Oh."Karen turned and looked at the man.She finally noticed how pale he looked.How worn out.Like a piece of elastic stretched to the point of tearing.Then she noticed his hands.The silver band around his finger.>"You've not told her yet?">The man looked at Karen, then down at his ring."No.I was just... *I don't know*.">"Got kids?">"Yeah.Little girl," he said proudly.He opened his jacket and pulled out his wallet.There was a picture of a kid, couldn't have been more than six, grinning broadly.>"She's cute.">"Takes after her pop," the man joked.>"If you say so!">"It's just... it'll be hard for them, you know.To watch a slow decline.All the treatments.All the hope, you know?It'll just make it worse in the end.">"Be harder losing a father when they might not have to.">"...maybe.">"You kidding?You can't really think-"

>He shook his head."I don't know.">"If I was your daughter, I sure as hell would want my pop to fight for me.To never give up on me.It's what dads do.">Karen patted him on his back, then glanced at her watch."Shit, I got to get back to work.See you around."I felt scolding tears spill down my cheeks as I flicked forward a few pages.He told them.His wife held his hand as he entered the hospital to begin chemotherapy.I skipped a few more.Then a few hundred.I landed on, and read, the entire chapter on his daughter's graduation.He was so proud.He was somehow prouder still, on the day he walked her down the aisle.Then, I came across another section with my name in it.My hands began to tremble as I read.>Perhaps it was serendipity that drew David to the Thread Library, and to Karen.>Perhaps it was simply fate that allowed David to save Karen, this time around.>"Hello?Is anyone here?"he yelled as he stepped inside.>Fate that he found her sitting there, weeping, in front of the ancient tome.That he was able to take her hand and lead her out of the library.My hands trembled as I closed the book and held my breath.*Hoping.*

*Praying.*

"Hello?Is anyone here?"

"Who are you?"Michael yelled at the approaching silhouette that seemed to be dragging itself through the spiralling cloud of red, desert dust, toward them.He raised a hand to his eyes and squinted, trying to get a better look at the figure - trying to decide if he should grab his little sister's hand and run far away from here, never turning, never looking back.But he knew they couldn't run.They'd *probably* die if they stayed, but he was certain they would die if they ran.It had been so long since they'd seen someone else - *anyone* else.He had thought they were the last.The figure was tall - even hunched over as it was, struggling to walk, Michael guessed it must have been at least seven foot.It clutched something long and curved in its right hand."Michael, Cibby is scared," whispered Isabella, clutching her beloved, no-legged doll tightly in the crook of her good arm.Michael looked at his little sister, sighed, then crouched down until he was eye level with her.Sweat was pouring out from her burning forehead and dribbling down to her torn, lilac tee.It was a sweat that they couldn't replace; there was no water here.There seemed to be no water left on Earth.He gently ran the back of his fingers down Isabella's cheek."Me too, Izzy.But we all need to be brave right now.Whoever is coming, we need their help.You're still not better - although, I'm sure you will be soon," he added, "and, well, we've not seen *anyone* since..."  His voice trailed off as he thought of their parents.Isabella bit her lip, looked up at the swirling, tombstone sky above and nodded."We'll be brave.""Good girl.Make sure you stay behind me, okay?Let me talk to him," Michael commanded, stepping in front of his sister."And if... anything happens to me.Anything bad, I want you to run as fast as you can, back the way we came."Michael turned to face the approaching figure.He could now make out the ragged cloak that hung loose around the thin body; the pointed blade that trailed on the desert floor, biting into the earth as it dragged along.But he couldn't see the features of the face hidden in the brooding shadow of the hood."Hello!"said Michael, raising a hand.The figure didn't respond; it continued trudging toward them."We- we don't mean you harm.My sister's sick and we've not had water for-"

Michael's mouth dropped open when he saw the skeletal feet poking out from the bottom of the cloak."Oh, Jesus."Now he was ready to run.He'd rather die on the radiation plains, his skin peeling and his heart dripping, than let this monstrosity come any closer.But his curiosity had never been greater; it took hold of his body and froze it in place."*What the fuck are you?*" he mouthed.The figure stopped a few feet from him.It tilted its head to the side, raised a bony hand to its face and peeled back its hood."*Oh, shit.* Izzy," he said, as he reached behind him, fumbling for his sister's hand, "get ready to run.Okay?""Pleaaase," came the terrible, pleading voice; it sounded as if it was being dragged through broken glass, as it rose up through the creature's throat.Isabella poked her head out from behind her brother.She gasped."Pleaaase," came the voice again.The creature raised a hand, its fingers reaching toward them.Then, it collapsed onto its knees, its scythe dropping to the ground."Let's go, okay sis?"said Michael, trying not to show the fear in his voice."...we can't go.I think it needs our help," said Izzy."It's in pain.""Izzy!What are you doing?"Michael hissed, as his sister slowly walked toward the creature, until she stood only a foot away from it."My name is Izzy," she said, before bursting into a cough that ripped her throat and tore at her lungs.It took her a moment to recover; she wiped the blood from her lips onto her arm."This - this is Cibby, and that's my brother Michael," said the girl."We don't have any water, but we have a little food.Would you like some?"The creature stared at Izzy for a moment, before, with what looked like great effort, stretched a hand out toward her."Don't!"shouted Michael, but it was too late.Izzy had already taken the pale hand in hers.It took only a second for her to fall limply to the ground, doll by her side."Izzy!"Michael screamed, running toward his sister and skidding to the ground next to her."Oh God, Izzy," he said, as snot and hot tears mixed in his mouth.Her eyes were shut and her chest was perfectly still."Please don't be dead.*Please please please.*" He shook her gently at first, then more firmly, then urgently.But his sister didn't respond.She didn't move.Michael picked up Izzy's doll, and placed it into her limp, open hand.Then, he buried his head into her chest and wept.The cloaked figured slowly got back to its feet.It bent down and picked up its scythe."What did you do to her, you- you *monster!*" Michael asked, his voice trembling as he turned to the creature."She was just a little girl and you-" 

He saw her left arm move first.The arm that hadn't moved since the mines."*What?* Izzy?"Her eyes slowly opened.The trace of a smile curved over her lips."Izzy!"he repeated through sobs and laughter."Oh God, Izzy, you're alive.Please - *please,* don't ever do that to me again."He kissed her cheeks a dozen times, and her forehead nearer a hundred, before hugging her tightly."He... he made me better," she said, as her brother finally released her, raising her neck and looking up at the creature.Michael stared anew at the cloaked figure.It looked stronger now.Taller, too.It took Michael a few moments to be able to whisper: "*thank you*."The creature nodded, before lifting his scythe high into the air."What are you..."

The creature brought the instrument down fiercely, tip first, burying it deep into the dry earth.A fountain of clear liquid erupted from the hole as he withdrew it.It didn't take long for a soft blanket of grass to begin sprouting underneath Izzy, quickly spreading out as if it was a puddle of water.It didn't take long for her to find the first tulip that had grown in a hundred years.Then, the first apple tree.Izzy whispered to her brother and pressed something into his hands.When the cloaked figure was finally satisfied by the sparkling oasis, he pointed a finger toward Michael and gestured for him to step forward.He did so."My sister wanted you to have this," Michael said, offering out a hand.Death paused for a moment, unsure, before reaching out and taking the doll.He looked at it curiously, turning it over twice.Then, he dropped it into a deep, dark pocket on the side of his cloak."There are others," he said, in a soft rumble."Only a few.You must bring them here.""How - how will I find them?""You will," it replied."She will be safe, here.Nothing evil can step foot into my garden."It turned and took three steps away from him, before pausing."I will see you again, someday," it whispered, not quite loud enough for Izzy to hear.Then, it continued its slow walk into the dancing dust of the desert."Thank you," Michael whispered, as the figure drifted out of sight.

Her skin was pale and her cheeks were hollow, but her eyes were still that same vibrant viridian I'd fallen in love with: the turquoise crest of a great wave, sparkling beneath moonlight one last time, before breaking against the cliff."Take it," I begged her, my own eyes a hazy sea."Please.It's not too late."Her body had been ravaged by cancer and chemotherapy; each day she changed - somehow even more frail and weak than the day before.There were no options left but the pill.She shook her head."I can't.""Yes!You can."She tried to smile but her lips only trembled."I won't take it.""I- I don't understand," I said, my voice cracking."I won't take it because," she paused to wet her lips, "I love you."I felt the warm wetness of broken promises roll down my cheeks."If you love me, you'd take it."I hated myself for saying it, but I *needed* her."When I die, you will have another forty years without me.Maybe more, maybe less.""I don't want to be without you for forty years.Take the pill," I whispered."Don't leave me.""If I did... when you die, I wouldn't be alone for forty years.I'd have eternity to be without you.""I... Maybe they'll have found a way to make it work for me, by then."I turned my head away so she didn't see the salty trail trickling down my face."And maybe they won't," she softly answered."Patrick, please, look at me."I turned back to her.Somehow she'd found the strength to smile."I've had the best life I could ask for," she whispered, "because I had you in it.I belonged here.Trying to imagine eternity without you - even the idea of it is more painful than anything I've been through."I forced a smile of my own as the hot tears streaked my face.I realised in that moment that she needed me every bit as much as I did her."I love you," I said, as I leaned over her and gently pressed my lips against her forehead.We talked a while longer, but she soon grew tired.I held her hand in mine and I read to her.The bedroom clock slowly ticked as the turquoise wave broke upon the cliff, and her hand fell limp.

"Got any work going?"I asked, pausing momentarily by the group of musicians."*Work*?"a woman stroking a harp mocked.She scrunched her face up and looked appalled.It was a reaction I had long gotten used to."Get outta here," said the fiddle playing man."You're a relic.No one works any more.Move along!"I tipped my hat, and continued walking.It wasn't their fault that I didn't see it - the point of a life without goals.Without work.I really *was* a relic - I knew that.It didn't mean I was going to change, though."Hey!"cried a high pitched voice, as footsteps smacked the tarmac behind me.I turned to see one of the young ladies from the group of musicians, running toward me - the violinist."Sorry," she said, panting, "about my friends.They just don't understand the concept of work.In their heads, it's tantamount to *slavery*."She rolled her eyes.I cocked my head to one side."And, what do you think?""Are you a slave if you want to do something?If you *love* doing something?""Are you a slave if that task gives you a purpose?"I agreed, nodding encouragingly."Music is my vice.I don't see the problem with labour being someone else's.Hey, do you mind if we sit?"she asked, already walking toward a bench.I followed."You know, my dad made me work, when I was a kid," she continued."He made me clean the dishes every evening after dinner - manually, I mean.You know, with hot water and soap and a sponge.""Why'd he make you do that?A machine could have done it more efficiently.""He thought it would teach me some kind of lesson.The value of hard work.I did gardening and cleaning, too.But, when I turned sixteen, that was it.He said I never needed to do a chore again in my life.""And..."

"And what?"Did you do another chore?""Yeah," she laughed, taking a seat on the wooden bench."I did the washing up every evening until I moved out."I smiled, as I sat down next to her."Why?""I don't know.I guess I kinda enjoyed it - it gave me time to think.And, I felt like I was being useful.""Providing value.""Yeah, I guess.Is that what you want to do: provide value?"I thought for a while."I want to have a purpose.""Are the arts not a purpose?""They don't fulfil me.Do you think your music is original?"She laughed again."No.With another four billion musicians on the planet, and only a handful of notes, I don't think there is much room left for originality.""Then, what do you get out of it?""I like the music," she said, twining a lock of auburn hair around her index finger, "it feels good in my head.And, I like to improve.It passes time, too, I suppose.""Passes time," I repeated, staring blankly into the distance."What is it?""It's just... when I was, well, not as old as I am now, people didn't do things to pass time, quite so much.Time was precious to the people who only had eighty years of it.""Eighty?"she said."Hell, I'm already seventy, and I feel like I've accomplished nothing.""Well, you've got many, many years left yet.""Hey," she said, glancing at me conspiratorially, "you want to know something?""Sure.""I still do my own washing up," she whispered, smirking.I smiled.We sat in silence for a while and watched a flock of sparrows settle in a mech-tree at the rear of the park."At least we still got real birds, right?"She seemed to get agitated as soon as the words left her mouth."Oh, geez," she said, raising her hands up, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that.""It's fine," I said softly, trying to reassure her."I don't mean that robots or whatever, - you know -"

"I know," I replied, nodding."Honestly, it's fine.I'm not offended."Her shoulders slumped slightly and she settled back into the bench.She yawned as the evening sun drenched us in its copper rays."Why do you wear this old thing?"she asked, playfully touching the tip of my panama."It's sentimental.It was given to me."She nodded."It kinda suits you.Makes you stand out.Maybe I need something like that, to help me stand out.""You stand out enough as you are," I replied.Her cheeks reddened ever so slightly.We sat for a while, as the sun dipped deeper behind the distant hill."I used to have a lot of work," I said, for no real reason, other than the vain hope of catharsis."Well..." she said, looking awkward again."You can't help yourself, can you?"I laughed."You're right, of course - that's what we were made for.To replace humans at their jobs.And doing that work is what triggered our pleasure responses.Satisfied us.""Why don't you just get reprogrammed?"she asked."Feel pleasure from creating, instead.From art."I sighed."Oh, I don't know.I just think if I did that...I wouldn't be *me* any more.Working is what defines me - it's a huge part of *me*, not just my past.""Yeah.I get that.I think.""What's your name?"I asked."At the moment?Jess.""Jess.That's a pretty name.""Do you have a name?""Albert.""Oh, did you choose that name?If you don't mind me asking.""I served a human family, for a while.They gave me that name.""What happened to the family?""They... died.They were an elderly couple when I started working for them.They were both amongst the last to die of cancer.Then, I took work elsewhere, other homes - other people.None like them though.They treated me as an equal."My left hand instinctively touched the brim of my hat; Jess must have noticed."I'm sorry," she said, her eyes wide and a little moist."It's okay.They're still alive, in here," I replied, tapping the side of my head."A few years later, I became an outdated model.Families didn't want me around, so I looked for work elsewhere.In the sewers, street sweeping, building - whatever I could get.I always kept the name, though.I liked it.Still do.""Then what happened?""Eventually, I became outdated at *everything*.Now, I look for odd jobs.Hope to find a broken down droid or such, that I can replace for a while whilst they're getting repaired.""Well, Albert, how are your taste receptors?""What do you mean?""I mean, can you eat?""Yes.""Well, come on then.I do a mean lasagne.Then you can help me with the washing up."Jess got up to her feet and held out a hand."Thank you," I said, as I took it."You're welcome," she replied, giving a curt bow.

The collector's whip ripped through the air and lashed the human's back.A trickle of red ran down the man's skin, dripping down onto the parched desert floor."Please," Iu-iu begged, "I can't go on.""That is your prerogative, but if you fall human, know that you will never get back up."The collector smiled, his black, jagged teeth dipping out of his mouth.Iu-iu stumbled back into line of men and women, and placed his blistered hands around the thick rope.The huge brick moved onwards, soon reaching the great structure's shadow.The collector watched, satisfied.This was his favourite part of the Re-Culture - where his race would step in to help put humanity on the *right track*.For a thousand more years, he would be held as a God.Worshipped and adulated by the pathetic race around him.Then, after another five thousand years, the planet would be ready to harvest.The brick was almost by the structure when Iu-iu fell.The collector ran his long tongue over his lips as he walked toward the body.He bent down, and in a single swift motion, snapped the man's neck.Then, he hoisted him over his shoulder and took him toward a nearby chamber, well hidden under the sand.He would feast well tonight.---

"Captain," said first officer Kate Robins, "we've found another planet."Captain Richardson leaned down to the - now lit - monitor on the arm of his chair."Looks a lot like home - just a little greener.What stage of development is this?""From the weather formations and the amount of ice remaining, the computer estimates 3000bc.We'll know more once we enter the atmosphere and can run some tests.""3000bc?"Richardson repeated.Kate nodded."This'll be the first planet we've found anywhere near that period," he said, stroking his chin."I wonder what's going on down there.""It's the start of the ancient Egyptian period," butted in Piraino, the ill-tempered archaeologist that they'd been forced to take with them."But I'd much prefer we found a planet a little more advanced.""I thought you were into old stuff.I heard that's why you married Elizabeth."Pirano glared at the captain, wondering for the hundredth time, how he'd possibly made it to that rank."I'm kidding, Pirano - lighten up," said the captain, raising his open hands."I am into old *stuff* - but we won't find an explanation for the cloned biospheres in the past.A version of Earth more advanced than our own, however, might be able to tell us.""You never know what we'll find down there, Pirano," replied Richardson."Captain," Kate said, there's... something *odd* down there.""Odd?How so?""You're not going to believe this, but we're detecting a hell of a lot of radiation around Alexandria, Egypt.""Radiation?""That's not all.There's some kind of neutron device down there.""*What!*" Pirano burst out."A neutron *drive?*"

"That can't be right," mused Richardson."I've run the tests - three times.It's right."Richardson let out a deep breath."Better take us down."Somewhere uninhabited," he added."We can't risk interfering with their development."---

Santa removed his spectacles and patted his pockets until he found his favourite handkerchief -- the red one, with S.C lovingly stitched in white at the bottom corner.It was fraying around the edges, just like his relationship with the woman who had given it to him.Where had the excitement gone?They used to fly, snuggled close together, high into the Arctic sky, as the stars above them shone brighter than any city had ever dared.They used to make love on the backseat of the sleigh, as the reindeer lolloped and chewed on the fluffy clouds.But that was long ago.A different life, he sometimes thought.The closest they had come to making love in the last few years, was when Santa had been choking on a turkey bone, and Mrs Claus had had to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre.He hadn't found it in the least erotic back then, but as time pressed on, the memory was becoming increasingly more so.If it wasn't for the damn sherry!That sweet, wonderful sherry.No -- he hadn't touched a drop for two months, and wasn't about to start.He let out a long breath, then with slow precise circles, he wiped away the steam from his spectacles, careful not to leave a single smudge mark.He placed them back above his nose and leaned against his chair.He picked up the letter-opener in one hand, while shuffling through the big black mail bag with the other.He picked one out at random.A soft, white envelope.How unusual."Oh dear, oh dear," he muttered, as he read the letter it contained.Once finished, he placed it down on the desk and took a few deep breaths.*It couldn't have been.No.Absurd!*

He rummaged in the secret cabinet under his desk, until he found the red liquid -- vintage 1892.A fine year.He popped off the cork and took a long swig of the sweet sherry.Then, he replaced the top and put the bottle back.He'd ignore it.That's what he'd do.He picked up another envelope and tore into it.*Transformers*.*Nintendo*.Seemed like things hadn't changed in thirty years.He ticked the letter off and scribbled his signature, before popping it into  a glass container and sending it down the chute for the elves to collect.He'd meant to pick up another envelope, but nothing was arriving between his fingers.He looked down, to see his hand hovering over the same, soft-white letter.He chewed on his lower lip for a moment, then suddenly snatched the letter from the table, and read it again."Oh dear, oh dear," he panted."What am I going to do?"Mrs Claus, who happened to be walking by at the time, peeked into the office."Everything okay, dear?""...just the stress of Christmas, my love.It will be an especially busy one this year.""Are you sure?You don't look well.You're sweating in that way you do when you've eaten one too many minced-pies."She narrowed her eyes and began scanning the room, looking for evidence.Santa dabbed at his forehead with his handkerchief; he was indeed drenched."It's just from stress.Besides, it gives me a healthy shine," he mumbled, "like the reindeer."He paused for a moment."Dear, will you come in here -- I could do with your opinion."Mrs Claus frowned, then trotted into the room, her eyes still darting about this way and that, searching for any tell-tale tinfoil.She sniffed."You better not have been drinking!Or I swear-"

"The door, please.""Oh," said Mrs Claus, her frown changing into a salacious smile as she closed the office door."Is that why you're so hot?Well, about time!""No, it's not that.""Oh," she said, disappointed but hardly surprised.It's not like he was ever up to the task these days, anyway."I didn't want to tell you," he said."I didn't want you to fret.But... well, read this," Santa said, passing the letter to his wife.Her face went pale, as the blood drained from it.When finished, she placed the letter back onto her husband's desk."Well?"said Santa."A hoax.""A hoax?""Well, it must be.Someone pretending it was meant for Satan, someone just trying to scare you."Santa started to run a thoughtful hand through his beard, but it got stuck in a knot half way down.He tried to pull his hand out, but only made things worse and soon half his arm was lost in the bristly jungle."You know better than to do that," Mrs Claus said, tapping an impatient foot on the ground."Oh, for Heaven's sake"--she began walking around the table--"here, let me."Together, they slowly worked his arm out of the thick, grey nest.For a moment there was silence."I think it's real.Feel the paper," said Santa."I did feel it, I don't--"

"It's angel wing.""No... it can't be," replied his wife, now starting to sweat herself."It is.And the name, the signature.*Belphegor*.That's the name of one of his generals.And then, there's the matter of the red ink..."

Mrs Claus hand's trembled as she took the letter again, rereading it very carefully.> Greetings from Heaven, lord Santa.I write to you with wonderful news -- Heaven has finally fallen!Hallelujah and praise the -- oh wait, ahahaha!The Angel's will rot in their cells until you arrive and decide their fate.God is in Hell-Fury chains -- I can hear him rattling them impotently, even as I write.Once you arrive and oversee our great work, I will prepare our army for the final mission: the extermination of humanity.> Greatly anticipating your arrival.> Belphegor

Santa reached into the cabinet, pulled out the bottle and handed it to Mrs Claus.She looked at him suspiciously for a moment, then took three long swigs.She wiped her mouth with her sleeve, and clanked the bottle down onto the table."Heaven has fallen to the Devil.And humanity is next," said Santa."It's hopeless.It's all over.It's all over!""Calm yourself, dear," said his wife, slapping his cheek and causing it to become even brighter than before."...thank you, sweetie," he said, nursing his cheek."I perhaps overreacted.""This letter," mused Mrs Claus, as she placed it back onto the table, "was meant for Satan.""Yes..."

"So, that means he hasn't read it yet.He doesn't *know* Heaven has fallen, yet.""No.Not yet.""Don't you see, sweetheart?"she said, her eyes wide."See what?""That gives us *time*!A chance.""You don't mean..."

Mrs Claus nodded."We couldn't possibly!""Why not?We have the factories.We have the elves.God needs *our* help!""It would take weeks for the factories to be able to start manufacturing weapons.To train the elves.To ready the reindeer for war.We'd miss Christmas!""But, it can be done?""I suppose it can," he agreed, running a hand through his beard again.This time, he made it to the end without it getting snagged.He let out a surprised, satisfied grunt."There was a time," said Mrs Claus, "when Christmas meant more than spoiled children getting an extra present or two.When *we* meant something.""...hope," he said, his eyes glazing."We meant *hope*.""Soon -- when those Hell spawns come for them -- children across the globe are going to need *hope* more than ever before.You'll be that shining red star in the sky that they'll be cheering for."They were both silent for a moment."We might die," he said."We might not," she replied.Santa looked up at the ceiling, his mouth dropping open slightly.What was the point of him living anyway, if humanity fell?Mrs Claus dropped a hand onto his thigh; he jumped."Belphegor will write Satan a new letter," said Mrs Claus slyly, "while you prepare the elves.""Belphegor?Why would he write another letter?""I mean *me*, you handsome, dimwitted dolt.I will pretend to be Belphegor, and inform Satan that the battle was a disaster.To not bother going up there.""My goodness!Did I... did I ever tell you that you're both beautiful and brilliant?That might just buy us the time we need.If we can free Heaven before he arrives..."

"Yes," said Mrs Claus, putting a leg over her husband and straddling him, "it's almost time for you to do some real sleighing."She winked."Almost."Mr Claus' eyes sparked like they hadn't done in years and he felt an odd sensation.He would free the Angels.He would save God and liberate Heaven.He would go to war with the Devil himself!But first...He leaned forward and pressed his lips against his wife's.---

Thanks for reading!This is just a one part thing, at least for now, as the plot is a little too similar to my Army of Death story.But I hope you enjoyed it :)

Back in Ancient Rome, sometime before Jesus was born, there was a rumour circulating that went something like this: if you should be awake for the entirety of seven days and seven nights, you might see the silhouette of a dead man walking the cobbled streets.A man whose pupils are blood-red and whose body is black and flaky, as if he wears a shroud of mould.If, the rumour goes, you should ever see this man... *run*.Do not try to speak to him -- just run.It was not a fable woven to trick young children into sleeping at night, although it did have that side-effect.It was a legend born, as many are, from reality -- although, that is a strange term in itself.The Romans called the shadow-man Insomnis: *the sleepless one.* His true name is long lost -- not even *he* remembers it.Insomnis, it is said, found a way to talk to the Gods themselves.Back when Insomnis was still a man, he was amongst the most pious of his townsfolk.He desired nothing more than to find a way to reach the Heavens, so that he might worship the Gods with his body and touch, not with meagre voice alone.He craved the idea of living eternally, serving at their side forever.The myth goes that his mind was quite brilliant, before *it* happened.That as a child, whatever he set his mind to, he was able to accomplish.But on his nineteenth birthday, when he swore he would find a way to reach the Gods, he was mocked -- told that his ideas had become too grand for his own mind, and that he had fallen heavily into the pit of foolishness.But he wouldn't be dissuaded by the jealous townsfolk.He knew they were afraid that he would find a way; that he would leave them behind to rot in the mortal realm.So began his early years of research.He started by sacrificing animals in the name of Apollo; small animals, first -- rabbits and chickens and such, giving up their bones and fat to the Heavens.When this brought him no closer, he tried the bigger animals: foxes, deer and cows.It is said that when that failed, he sacrificed *other* creatures, but again to no avail.It wasn't until years later, when he learned of guided meditation, that he made any real progress.In his meditative state, he was able to exert some control over his unconscious mind -- to guide it and manoeuvre it.And in that state, he saw a glimpse of something distant.But the world in his meditative mind was too limited to get nearer to that *something;* to see it for what it was.Still, it set a fire burning inside of him and he knew he was finally getting near.He now understood that the way to the Gods was not through worship, but through the mind -- and the most powerful tool of the human psyche is *dreaming*.Through his dreams, he might see that which was beyond the scope of his imagination.And so he trained himself to guide his mind during his sleep; to control his existence inside his dreams.For seven years he explored the constraints of the night realms, finding -- probing -- the edges and limits, learning to exert control over it.It is said that as he grew closer to them, the Gods in their anger warned him away and told him that he must look no further, for there are realities that are not meant for mortals; truths that are sealed in the darkness and locked away in the void.But he did not listen to their warnings and instead felt encouraged by them.He saw it as a test of faith that they had set for him.He began to drug himself, ensuring he fell in the deepest of sleeps known to the Romans.His control over his dreamstate grew ever stronger, and the boundaries of the night realm began to weaken before him; cracks and fissures appeared that he battered his mind against until they grew into a hole he could slip through.What he saw there is unclear in the stories, but they all agree that he drifted into the Bacchanalian realm of the Gods.There, he saw a vision not meant for our kind; *he saw into the eyes of Jupiter himself*, and Jupiter was displeased with him.Jupiter told him that next time he slept, because of him, the lights of existence would be extinguished.He woke in a fit, screaming and sweating blood.From that moment, he resolved never to sleep again -- he never dared to shut his eyes and even ripped off his eyelids for fear of falling.But as time passed and his madness grew deeper, both his body and mind wasted away and faded to a place between the realms of the Gods and the planes of the mortals, until he existed *nowhere*, except in the glimpses of our madness.I mention this story because I haven't slept in eight nights now.I mention it because *Insomnis* whispers to me as he sits on the end of my bed, his red pupils pulsating inside the darkness of his rotting shroud.He tells me that the stories were wrong; it wasn't the Gods that he found in the planes outside of our existence.There was something far worse than them waiting in his dreams.The Gods of the Gods.A reality beyond reality.He calls them the *maintenance men*.They watch us from outside of reality, waiting for a glitch: *a sleepless one*.And when they catch the glitch -- when they should finally fall asleep -- the maintenance men will turn off the stars and will reset reality.Insomnis says now that I know about them, the maintenance men will come for me.That existence will be snuffed out like a candle, should I sleep.But they can't reset it, if only I can stay awake.As I write this, Insomnis lays a knife down on my desk.He tells me that I cannot go back; I cannot ever sleep again.He stretches my eyelids out, and waits for me to raise the knife and cut.

Alexander stood for a time atop the muddy pit, staring into the exhumed emptiness below.Rain had slicked his hair into a greasy broth that dripped down over his forehead."I would have come back for you..." he whispered to the nothingness."This was the spot, then?"Stephen asked, as he walked up to the King.Alexander looked at his cousin, wondering if the question was entirely innocent.*Had he heard him whispering?*  He supposed he would have had to have told him anyway, if they'd found the body.Unlike the other two men, Stephen was most certainly not disposable.Alexander nodded.He was sure this was the spot.He could almost hear the vulture screaming nearby; could almost see its dripping beak.He turned to look for the two burly men that had accompanied them.A sepia mist had, like a veil, quickly fallen and now concealed much of the fields; it took him a while to spot them.Their silhouettes stood hunched under a great oak, their spades hanging impotently in their arms."Then it looks as if someone beat us to it," Stephen said with a grin, as he examined the pit."Well, at least we don't need to..." He ran a thumb across his neck and nodded towards the oak.He laughed and put a hand onto Alexander's shoulder."Alex- *Your majesty*, what was buried here of such import?What makes someone as powerful as you now are, worry so?"Alexander paused for a moment."I am not as powerful as you might think.I do not yet have the loyalty of the entire kingdom.Until I can show them the princess's head, some will still refuse to bow."Stephen frowned."Oh come now, cousin.You underestimate your people - they are grateful to you for disposing of the traitor King.You put an end to his... *atrocities*.As for the princess, she *is* long dead - everybody knows it.And if not, she has fled the kingdom.No one has seen her in almost a decade.The rebels have no proof that she is alive - they have *nothing*.""They have hope!"Alexander snapped."Perhaps," Stephen retorted,"but you evaded my question with the skill of a political courtier.What was it that was buried here?""Do not test my patience, cous-"

The scream that came from the mist sent a chill through Alexander's bones."What was that?"whispered Stephen, his hand moving quickly to the hilt of his sword."Your men..." said Alexander, looking towards the oak but seeing only grey mist."Cameron!David!"Stephen yelled out.There was no reply."Gods damn them both.Wait here, *your majesty*."Stephen drew his sword and walked towards the tree.Slowly, his form was engulfed by the mist.Alexander looked down at the pit as he waited, but the nightmares began to fill his mind, and he soon had to avert his gaze.That's when he saw them.Two green jewels shining like stars through the misty darkness."You said you would come back," came a soft hiss, almost like a twisted lullaby.The noise surrounded him, covering him as a mouldy blanket."Katie," he whispered, as he fell to his knees."You promised you'd come back.""I would have," Alexander lamented, his hands trembling "But I couldn't - not yet!I never forgot about you, Katie.That I promise.Never!"There was a terrible sound, like an off key hymn.Katie was laughing."Promises," she hissed."You can't hurt me," Alexander said, more hopeful than certain."I don't want to hurt *you*," the sibilant voice taunted."We're meant to be together, Alexander."Then, the green eyes faded into the mist, and were gone, but the voice echoed around him one a last time, "And soon, we will be."It took a while for the shaking to stop and for Alexander to regain a semblance of composure.He began walking, staggering, towards the tree, dreading what he knew he'd find.As he drew near, he saw the three silhouettes dangling from a high branch.They peacefully rocked back and forth in the misty, afternoon breeze.A vulture screeched somewhere in the distance.---

"Greetings, your majesty," Malcolm said softly."Did you find what you were after?""Yes," Alexander replied after a moments pause."I'm glad to hear it!"The old man beamed and clapped his hands."Perhaps you would like a bath run, before dinner?""No," Alexander replied.He looked into the old man's eyes."This day is far from done.I must visit the dungeons."---

"Sarah?"asked the necromancer.His mouth was dry and his heart beat like a gavel in his ears.Every time, the anticipation - *the hope* - swallowed him up and allowed him to imagine she was back.Then, it would chew him up and spit him out, and he would feel the same terrible things as when he'd found her body in the bathroom.It took her a moment to realise she had returned.She craned her neck up to look for the necromancer.He stood at the end of the table, his lips trembling, and his pale face wearing a smile that was at the same time hopeful and utterly desperate.It pained her to see him like this."I'm sorry, James.""Diana..." he whispered, as he slumped down against a bookshelf."It's you again..."

Diana's arms gained feeling before her legs; one at a time, she threw her thighs off the table and, using her legs like anchors, sat up.James' face was more lined than before and his hairline had scampered further back.His eyes were gray and hollow.Diana thought he was the most tortured soul she'd ever seen.She turned her head slowly and looked about the basement; the bookshelves held many new black tomes, thick and weathered.There were both more crosses and pentagrams dotted around the room - more of his wife's old dresses, too.Then, she saw the mirror and let out a gasp.James looked up."Are you okay, Diana?""Where... where did you get the body from?"She gently touched her face, running a finger down the smooth curves of her cheeks."Oh.She was in a skiing accident.Broke her neck.You," he paused and frowned, "you didn't think I killed her, did you?""No!The thought never crossed my mind," she lied."Good.Because, you know me better than that by now, I think.""Of course.It's just I was taken back... *she's so beautiful*."James nodded."I think Sarah would have been happy with it."She nodded."James," Diana began, reaching down and stretching her legs out, "you can't keep doing this.""I'm *so* close, Diana.I think I even know where I went wrong - next time I'll get it!"Diana sighed."James, listen to me.She's not coming back.""You're wrong!"he snapped."I just need to keep going.I need to keep trying."Diana saw tears welling in the necromancer's eyes, and felt a warm wetness running down her own cheeks.She couldn't stand it any longer.It would hurt him, but she had to do it.She had to put an end to this - for her sake, and for his."James, you know how she died.""Yes, of course.She was murdered - and I wasn't there to protect her.""You found her in the bath.""They slit her wrists," he said, his face blank and his voice suddenly void of emotion."*She* slit her wrists.""No.That's not what happened.""I've spoken to her, James.Many times.""*What?* he said, his eyes widening and his teeth clenching together."Why wouldn't you have told me that before!""I didn't want to tell you because, I thought it would hurt you too much."He paused for a moment."When you go back, I need you to find her.Tell her, I'll find a way to bring her here.Tell her, I love her.""She loves you too, James.""I know," he whispered."But she doesn't want to come back.She can't.She chose to leave the world, not just you.Trying to force her back, because you miss her... it's... it's just selfish.""Go back," James said, getting up from the floor."Go back, before I send you back myself."Both his arms and voice were trembling."Please, James.""Go back!"he screamed, running to a shelf and snatching a knife."Or I swear to God..."

Diana swallowed.She forced herself off the table and began walking toward James.She *had* to get to him, to make him see - but she only managed a single step before her legs gave way and she fell to the cold, concrete floor.Her head bounced off the ground and pain shot through her body.James walked over to her, knife in hand.He turned her over; blood dribbled out of her forehead, dyeing her blonde hair a sticky strawberry."I'm sorry," he said."Please... don't bring me back anymore," she said, as the knife hung over her chest."Let this be the end."There was something new in her voice - or maybe it was in her eyes - that surprised James.It was something *familiar*."Sarah?"he whispered as his face grew pale.The blade rested above her for a few seconds, swaying back and forth like a pendulum.She thrust her arms up and grabbed hold of his hands; she forced them down, plunging the knife deep into her chest.She could feel her life slipping away.Somewhere far in the distance, she could hear James screaming - *begging*."Goodbye, baby," she said, as the light dwindled to darkness.

Our spades were starving and feasted on the mud, but each new crater we opened quickly became a pool of rainwater for the rats to swim in.I swatted 'em away with my spade end, sending them a foot in the air.Only the stupidest came back for more.Esther's gold necklaces gave sound to the wind, but it was her clicking tongue that gave noise to her disapproval."Just rats," I said, shrugging her displeasure from off my shoulders and into the deepening grave."Why do you dislike rats so much?""It's nothing personal.""So you wouldn't hit a cat that way?""If it was swimming on a shallow lake in my ex-lovers grave?""Well?""No, of course not Esther.What do you think of me?"I turned away from her and grinned."I'd have to swing much harder to send a cat into the sky."She paused, then laughed, mouth so wide it put on display her golden tooth like it was an exhibition at an art gallery.The laughter was an off key accompaniment to the jangling of her jewellery.Eventually her mirth smothered out and she waggled a finger in my direction."You are truly something, Mister John.I start to remember why I like you."The evening was turning into night and the rain drops that crawled down my neck were fingers of ice.Esther seemed less bothered by the cold than I was, and if anything, was starting to look excited.A permanent half-smile had settled itself comfortably on her lips.We dug together silently, 'cept for the night's music.Suddenly, the slopping of our spades in the muddy-water gave way to a wooden thunk.Breath left my lungs but dropped a seed of unease into my stomach on its way out."It's her," I said."Her coffin, I mean.Help me work it loose."Esther nodded and we began digging trenches around the edges, working the cheap pine box free from the earth's sticky fingers."Tell me, Mister John, what is it that this woman knows that you can't afford to let out?I thought you kept other people's secrets, not your own."I forced my spade beneath the coffin, my boots and trousers swimming in the mud, and began to pry it up, leaning my weight heavily onto the spade."Everyone's got some skeletons in their closet.No exceptions."The earth slurped as the casket came free.I walked behind it and began to push, as Esther got on her knees at the top of the pit and dragged it upwards.I should have realised that the box was too light as we hauled it with ease out of the ground and laid it to rest next to the open grave.But I wasn't thinking straight.I was drunk on thoughts of that pretty girl I swore I'd one day marry.That I'd always protect.Protect... *You didn't do such a great job of that, buddy.* If Esther really could bring her back, what would I say to her?How many ways were there to say sorry, and would my Juliet want to hear any of them?I was torn from my thoughts by a hollow rapping.*Knock knock knock.*  The seed of unease I carried matured into a flower of dread.Juliet was knocking.Wanting to be let out.But I turned to see Esther standing next to the coffin, grinning at me.It had been her spade tapping against it.She said, with much mirth, "Your face was quite the picture.""You're lucky it's not the last picture you'll ever paint.""I thought the moment deserved some levity.Now, are you ready?"The lip of her spade was already between casket and lid."Yeah.I'm ready."She nodded.There was thunderous crack as the wood splintered and the lid shot up.I half expected to see a skeleton sit up and point an accusatory finger at me.Fully expected the stench of stale air and decomposing body parts to hit us.But there was none of that.Just a couple of rats that scampered out of the box and into the watery pit besides it.We leaned over the box to see scraps of blooded cotton."Someone got here before us," I said, trying to swallow back my relief and my disappointment."Taken her body.""All that's left is her clothes," said Esther thoughtfully."And I can't bring those back to the land of the living."A glint of something pale caught my eyes in the moonlight, mostly hidden beneath a swathe of red-stained dress.I leaned down and brushed the material aside."Well, well, well," I said, holding the bone between my forefinger and thumb."Looks like they forgot something."Esther rubbed her hands together."I always meant to put a ring on this one," I said.Then, I turned to my companion."Anything you can do with it?A finger's got to be better than nothing.""Yes, it's much better than nothing," she replied, as I began to hope."One can pick their nose with a finger.Can't do that with nothing.""Can you bring... Ah, forget it.I'm being an idiot as always.It's just a finger bone.""No, you're not wrong or foolish.Not this time.Hold it in your palms and I will prepare the incantation.Let's see what we can do, ey?"I did as she instructed, all the while thinking about who had the body.Didn't have to think hard: Alexander Wickan.And just maybe, he hadn't had to talk to the body for it to have revealed its secrets to him.If that were true, then--

"Close your eyes, Mister John," Esther instructed."Then, I begin."I did so, and as soon as they shut, a new chill seeped into my spine.Colder than the rain.The wind itself seemed to begin talking.It was a language I didn't understand, and it seemed to speak a dozen words at once, as if it had had one too many drinks before coming out for the night.The finger twitched in my hand, and I almost dropped it.But I just 'bout held both my nerve and the digit.Then, a moment later, the wind went quiet.There was a sloppy thud, as if something had fallen into the mud."Esther?"No reply.I opened my eyes to see my friend lying still in the mud.Where she had been a moment before, now stood a man in a red robe wearing a mask that was half white, half black.The symbol of the Two Christ's sacrificed.He held in his hand a long scepter with a round, cracked globe at its top.The earth splitting apart as God returns for judgement day.I popped the finger into my coat pocket and swapped it out for my pistol, aiming it at his mask."Stay back.""We are pleased to see you again," said the priest."The one who caused us so much trouble.""Ah, you give me far too much credit," I replied."Eric did most of the leg work.Now, I need you to back away from me and my friend, understand?Or ain't no God in this world or the next that's going to save you."Footsteps squelched in the mud behind  me.I craned my neck to see another four -- no, five -- figures in scarlet robes and Christ masks closing in on me.The man standing over Esther's body stepped closer."The Christ's demand a new secret to be sacrificed.What better gift to bestow them than all of your secrets?"I didn't wait for him to take another step.The trigger squeezed and the bullet bit into his mask and came flying out the other side.The priest stopped.I waited for him to drop...But he didn't.He just stood there."What the--" I leaned down to look through the hole in his mask.Dim moonlight shone through it from the other side.No blood.No brain.Just cracked porcelain.He shrugged his shoulders."We've changed our habits since you and your friend took away our congregation.""Yeah?Well habits are great to change every now and then, but you should change your robes, too.No man should be--"

The howling wind had hidden the footsteps that crept up behind me.Something bashed against my skull on the side, then I fell into the mud, staring at Esther's face.Then, lights went out.---

I awoke to chanting.My head pounded and... Why did I feel so damn hot?I tried to sit up, but my arms and ankles were tied down.I could see the muraled church's roof above me -- the two Christ's slitting their wrists in the lake of baptism.But I could only see up.To my sides was only  darkness.Or... No, it wasn't darkness.It was a dark wood."Ah shit," I said, as I realized I was in a box.And the box was moving.

The judge slammed his gavel on the wooden block and silence fell like a blanket over the court.The Dazzler sat perfectly still in her seat, her face - usually stretched wide by a warm smile - was now blank.Expressionless."The jury find the defendant guilty on all charges."Her head fell into her hands and her body shook as she wept.The man next to her placed an arm around her shoulders.I heard him murmur soft reassurances, but I was too far back to make out the exact words of the impotent promises."I am sad," continued the judge, "to find that your gift was not spent stopping crime, but instead from preventing it *being* stopped - and from preventing the city itself from tackling its problems at the roots.All your acts were done solely to further your career and profile.You are an egotist, in the worst and most dangerous fashion.In your *all-for-show* heroics, Miss Jones, many innocent people died.Collateral damage to you, perhaps - but loved ones to others.Bricks falling on heads, and trains coming to sudden, horrific halts.*Heart attacks* from your ludicrous speeds when flying with people in your arms - and who could forget Mr Kennedy?It is with deep regret - *regret at the potential you wasted* - that I sentence you to the most severe punishment this court, or any other, can.To death."A wave of shock ran through the people in the court; gasps and cries and shocked nothings.A little girl near the front was in tears; her mommy picked her up and rubbed her back."There, there.It'll be okay, honey," she cooed.But it wouldn't be 'okay'.The Dazzler wouldn't protest the decision.She wouldn't even fight for her life.Pathetic.I knew she'd give in, because she respected the law.Believed in justice - her world was built on unshakeable foundations.She'd allow herself to die for childish dreams and impossible ideals.She'd allow the city to twist the knife deep into her back.It had been so easy to pay off the criminals of the city for a few short weeks.Their sprees could continue soon, and there would be no Dazzler to stop them.The hope of the city, when they realised what they had done to their hero, would be snuffed out like a candle - the rising smoke lingering forever in the skies above them.They had released a smog that would soon suffocate them.I excused myself from the courtroom, holding the grin from my face until I was safely behind the wooden doors.

I would absolutely *love* to become a published writer one day - it's what I dream of.I've been writing short stories on Writing Prompts for the last year or so, practicing my writing and hoping one day to move forward and begin a novel.Your support can help me reach that goal, as it would allow me more time to write, rather than work at the full time job I currently have, that often also takes up my evenings.As such, I have just set up a Patreon account - https://www.patreon.com/user?u=5868062

Please don't feel you have to pledge anything at all - I don't expect you to (I honestly wouldn't want you to, if you don't have the money to spare), and just reading my stories here means ton to me.But if you do want to, I have set up a bunch of rewards, depending on the level of your pledge.All levels give access to my Patreon only stories that I will shortly start writing.Right now, I have started a weekly story about Ishida (from The Army of Death).Thank you for reading :)

Aw, thank you whoever gilded this.That means a lot to me :)

I'd gotten home earlier than expected, only to find the door of our little house in the country, pried open.Splintered shards of dark wood had been sprayed far into the house."Mark?"I said, hurrying inside."Oh, Jesus."Mark lay on the floor in the living room, blood gurgling out of a jagged wound in his stomach and dyeing the carpet a deep, wine-red."Oh God, baby," I said, kneeling by his side and taking his hand in mine.I could see that the skin around the wound was black, and the smell of singed skin wafted up my nostrils."It's- it's going to be okay-"

Mark tried to speak - he tried to tell me that there was a man behind me in the doorway, and that I had to run - but all he managed was a rasp of air.I screamed as a terrible heat seared my left cheek.The bolt of lightning had just missed me, but had still been near enough to cause a wicked pain and send me sprawling to the floor.A voice tutted, and I saw a large man with blonde hair stride into the room."Pity you had to come home, too.I do hate killing people, but..."  He smiled and clasped his hands together; a puddle of light began to grow between them.It started as a dim glow, but was becoming more intense with every passing second."You- you're so brave," I stuttered, touching my scorched face with a hand, "and you must be *so* powerful to have beaten my non magical husband.""Shh," he grinned, as the light continued to grow.He was slowly pulling his hands apart, stretching wide a dancing arc of brilliant light.I could see he was young and arrogant.I could do this, I just had to concentrate.I had to forget about Mark, at least for now."If we met under different circumstances, your incredible magic would have me *drooling*.""Oh?"he said.At least he was listening to me."Sure, my panties would have been off, like, two minutes ago.You're handsome, too.Your endless acne is like a million beauty spots; your nose, the perfect coat hanger.""What are you doing?"he asked, scowling.The intensity of the light was waning slightly.I got up onto my knees, encouraged."I'm not usually into larger people, but somehow the weight *really* suits you.You've got this bloated, pale walrus vibe going on, and no woman can resist that.And that chin strap beard, it really frames your face.""..."

"Not to mention how good you smell!I was wondering, as I was driving home, just *what is* that wonderfully pungent aroma, hanging over the countryside?Now I know!"The lightning in his hands was dissipating, and I could feel my own power bubbling up inside my body."You're- you're just trying to distract me!"he spat.But it was too late, his power was dying and I understood why.He tried to shoot the remaining light at me, but it fell like a brick to the floor before reaching me, fizzing into nothing on the frayed carpet.I saw his hands tremble, as red light began to bathe me."If you're as good in bed as you are with magic, you must be the world's greatest lover," I said, throwing my arms forward and commanding the red fury to leave my body and latch onto him.The intruder screamed as the spell ate into him, gnawing at his skin and devouring his eyes like a hungry acid.He tried to run, but the red fury wouldn't leave him.I knew he wouldn't even make it down the drive.The man's powers had fed off our emotions - of us being *scared* of him.But I hadn't been frightened enough, and Mark had lost conciousness.I turned to my husband and cradled his head in my arms."Honey," I whispered, "It's going to be okay."Mark didn't respond.He didn't move.I took a deep breath, as tears trickled down my face."You're so stupid," I said to him."Thinking I love you, when really I think you're the worst.The absolute worse.I'm actually extremely happy you're dying on me.I think I can live an *amazing* life without you.I'd had an absolutely terrible life with you in it, so now - so now, it's going to be brilliant.So much better."The magic ran through my body once more - I felt it as blue, this time - and I channelled it into him."I cheated on you tons, and it was so easy, because *everybody* loves me and can put up with me.You're not the only person in my life.Uh uh.Nope.If there's one thing I know for sure, I can definitely live without you."

My life was complete the moment Isabelle was born.She wasn't just the final piece slotted into a jigsaw -- more like, before she was born, my life was the rickety scaffold of the jigsaw, the outside pieces only, bending and writhing but unable to find stability without all the bits in the middle.Empty.Then, Isabelle came into my life and even though her mother and I had separated, the jigsaw was somehow complete.On the surface of the puzzle was an ever changing picture of me and my baby.The first year it was of a chaotic kitchen, bottles of milk strewn around, dirty plates on the sideboard and piles of clothes waiting desperately for someone to help them into the washer.And in the eye of the storm, I'm attempting to feed Isabelle but she's refusing to open her mouth.There's a broad smile tugging at my lips, my baggy eyes glowing with a happiness I couldn't fully appreciate in the moment.The next year was a picture of a buggy in the park, of us passing an empty playground.I soon understood why no kids were playing, as the clouds emptied their burden.I threw my coat over the pram and made my way home as icy fingers of rain crept down my tee and sploshed onto the ground.Isabelle laughed and clapped beneath her polyester shelter.I should have hurried us back to the house, but I must have realised I'd someday look back at that moment and hug it close to my heart.And so I strolled back home.You can only get so wet, anyway.Then, there's one of me in her room: I'm hovering over her shoulder like a gadfly, with the warm orange glow of a desk-lamp dancing on my face; I'm pointing at her textbook as if trying to help.She's playfully swatting my hand away.I bettered my world geography just so I could help her.Just so I could sit down with her in the evenings and smell her sweet hair and hear her even sweeter laughter.Once her homework was complete, we'd play battleships or Whist -- that was the only card game I could ever get her to play with me.The only one she didn't think was stupid.On the twelfth year, holes began to appear.Pieces of the jigsaw went missing, as if the Devil himself had pried them away with his pitchfork.The penultimate image imprinted on the puzzle face, in a faded sepia, is of Isabelle in a hospital bed with tubes stuffed up her nose, her beautiful blonde hair long gone -- just a fading memory of better times.I'm there, by her side as always, the bags under my eyes darker and larger than even when she was a baby crying through the nights.She's telling a joke.Her beaming face a light in the darkness that was becoming my life.There's a tiny jigsaw piece missing from her head, and another, larger piece, from my chest.'Can we play a game, dad?I'm bored.No one comes to see me anymore.''I come everyday!And your mother's here whenever she can be.'She rolls her eyes.'I mean my friends.I think *they think* I'm already dead or something.'I turn and pretend to rummage through my bag that's slumped on the chequered floor, but I can feel the warm wetness trickling down my cheeks.'Sure honey, what would you like to play?Battleships?''Lame.''Oh."I swallow back tears and snot.'How about Whist?'she says with a grin.And then the final image on the jigsaw.A picture I want to forget but that is burned into my mind as if someone took a brandishing iron to it.I shut my eyes and I all I see is her frail, bony face as her eyelids close over her ocean green eyes, a final time.So I got a new picture; a tattoo of Isabelle's face on my forearm, to help me fight the image that haunts my waking dreams.It is of when she had both hair, and hope of a future.And that smiling, kind face looking up at me each day, it keeps me going.Just.---

I often go to the park where the rain caught us that one precious day.I often sit on a bench opposite the playground and pretend to read a book -- the same book for almost a year -- and I watch the other children play, and remember the times when my daughter climbed the monkey-bars and swung on the rusting metal seats.And I get so jealous that I just want to scream.So I go home and I drink cheap gin, until I collapse onto her bed and bury my head into her pillow.Then I weep until I fall into a restless sleep.It's on one of those days, where I'm pretending to read my book, and the sun's shining like everything is just fine, when a woman sits down next to me.She's about my age -- maybe a little younger.Her arm brushes mine, then she loses herself in the sights and sounds of the playground.I notice the tattoo on her arm.A handsome, grinning boy.Then my gaze drops to my shoes.---

'Hi... my name's Isabelle.''Hey!My name's Ethan.''You, erm, want to go play?'She places one foot behind the other and runs a hand through her long, blonde locks.'I've been kinda bored.''Uh, we kinda can't?'he mocks.'The playground's out of bounds, at least for us.Which sucks.'Isabelle rolls her eyes and reaches out a hand.'I know some cool places where we can go, and the other kids can't.'Ethan frowns.'I don't know...'

'Don't be a chicken!''I'm not a chicken.Fine!'He reaches out, but instead of taking her hand, taps her on the shoulder."Tag!You're it!"Ethan runs off up his mother's arm, up to her shoulder."Wow," Isabelle says, stunned.She bites her lip and thinks for a moment.Then, Ethan's face pops out from between his mother's armpit, and he blows a raspberry."Oh, okay, it's so on!"Isabelle yells, as she jumps across onto the lady's arm and gives chase."You'll never catch me!I'm the king of the skin!"Isabelle giggles as she hurries after him.---

"Are you okay?"the lady asks me, breaking my reverie."I... uh... yeah, I'm sorry.It's just, your tattoo.It just made me..." 

"Oh"--she looks down at her arm--"that's my son.Christian."She lets out a deep breath."It's to remember him."I nod and hold out my arm."Isabelle."She tries to smile at me, but her lips are shaky."I--'

We sit in silence as we watch the children play and and listen to their laughter.When I finally have to go, I turn to her."I'm here most days, if you, you know -- if you want some company."She nods."Thank you.I guess I'll see you again, then."As I walk away, for the first time in a long time, a smile creeps up, uninvited, over my lips.

My eyes open to a stinging darkness and it takes a moment for my legs and arms to begin thrashing.I realise I'm drowning.I spin around until I see a weak web of light swaying far above me; my strokes are lumbered and my head pounds, but somehow, I make it to the surface, spitting out stagnant water and swallowing huge helpings of air.I clamber out of the lake and lie still by its side, trying to remember...It was meant to be a vacation - that much I'm sure of.I'd been saving up for months.But *something* must have gone wrong.I can't remember where, or when, I aimed for, but I highly doubt it was for a stagnant lake, or anywhere, for that matter, in this uninhabitable, mountainous jungle around me.My chest fights against me and my breathing is raspy and laboured.Each time it rises, the bruises on it scream in protest.Another hour passes and the dizziness finally lessens its hold.I take out the device from my jacket pocket - relieved it's still working - and check the date.I laugh a little; I cry a lot.A hundred and twenty million years.I've far exceeded the length of any previous jump.Something must have gone terribly wrong.I can't be detected this far back, or helped - and worst of all, I can't do a return jump.The device will charge in the sun, but it could take years to build up enough energy to make even half the time I need.*Shit*

Desperate to find a water source and some type of shelter, I begin my trek through a lush, jungle  valley surrounded on each side by mountainous cliffs.The place is alive with the cawing of birds and the taunting, distant trickle of running water.I try to follow the sound, my mouth salivating at the thought of a cool drink, but no matter how far I walk, the noise of the stream never grows.After a couple of intense, sweat-dribbling hours, I realise I've been going in circles, and I'm near the stagnant green lake where I began.Clenching my fists and doubling my resolve, I start over.The sun is overhead and there is a gap in the covering of the trees; *it* sees me, before I see it.The pterodactyl is diving down toward me from the cliff on my left-hand side, claws extended and sharp teeth a blinding white in the sun.I fumble in my jacket until I feel the reassuring cold of the lazer.I send three shots toward it, intendedly missing.It worked; the creature soars upward, high above my head and finds a new perch up on the other side of the valley.A familiar *beep* cuts through the sounds of nature.Figuring my phone is low on battery, I'm all the more surprised when I pull it out and see the *actual* reason: it had found a wifi network.The name of the network is: Jonathan.*My name.* My breath hitches as I watch it auto-connect, the password already saved on my phone.Thoughts flood my mind.Have I been set up?Was I sent here for a reason?Am I on some kind of *mission*?*I just can't quite remember...*  What I do know is that there is someone out there - maybe more than one person - and that just maybe, they can help me get back.I create my own wifi network - letting them know I'm here, and to help them find me in case anything happens.Then, using my wifi signal as a kind of makeshift compass, I make slow, trial-and-error progress toward the source of their signal.It eventually takes me up a steep, craggy cliff, and out of the thick, jungle floor.It's almost evening by the time I find the flat, jutting plate of rock that the body is lying on.It takes me a moment to work up the courage to turn the body over, but I recognise the clothes well enough.I kneel down at the side of this other *me*.His eyes are open and he looks in shock.Almost alive.But his chest isn't moving, and I know he's dead.I also know what killed him.This was the cliff the pterodactyl had been swooping down from.The angle at which I had aimed my three warning shots.Accidentally, I had violated the most sacred law of jumping - and murdered myself in the process.For a while, I sit and contemplate my situation.How had a future me gotten here?Did it mean that I was going to die soon, too?I can't bear looking at the dead me for any longer - I only see my own mortality in its glazed features - and I drag him to the side of the cliff.A body of water lies below me; I roll him off and turn away.Did I hear something, before the splash of the body reaching water?Like... the scream of a pterodactyl.I finally decide; I have to go back in time, and save the dead *me*.If I don't, *I* will soon be dead.It doesn't matter how many laws I break - I *have* to do it.The device has enough charge, thanks to the blistering Jurassic sun.The jump is painless, and I feel like nothing has happened at all.I should only be back a few hours - just before *me* dies - but he's not yet here, on the cliff ledge.My only proof the jump even worked, is the glaring sun high above me.I walk over to the spot where I found *my* body and slowly run my hands down my face, frustrated and anxious.The pterodactyl comes out of nowhere, startling me as it flies almost over my shoulder - I can feel the breeze of its huge, pumping wings.It swoops down toward the jungle floor, eyes locked on some prey or another."Oh shi-" I mumble, as the lazer hits me in the chest and I collapse in a pile

I'm still stunned when he finally arrives.I try to tell him - try to force my lips to move: "you had it on *stun*," but he doesn't hear.I don't make a sound.I can't even close my eyes.He drags me toward the cliff edge, and finally as I'm falling, I manage to make a sound.The air - the shock - awakens my body.I force a hand to my pocket; to the device.Too late.Blackness.My eyes open to a stinging darkness and it takes a moment for my legs and arms to begin thrashing.I realise I'm drowning.

Alex watched as the second sun collapsed over the distant horizon, dousing the walled city of Aspda in a goodnight glass of crimson wine.Beyond, and far below the wall he stood atop, on the craggy tundra of the Netherplanes, the unmoving, crucified silhouette of a titan rose high above the ten-thousand corpses surrounding it.A hand fell on Alex's shoulder: gentle and light and yet it still made his body flinch and his stomach fall.When he turned to see Eleni standing there, her golden hair and white stola drenched in the red sunset, he had to hide his relief for fear she would see his nerves."You shouldn't be out," Alex said, although grateful that she was."The last sun is already failing.""I know, and yet,"--she smiled as she shrugged--"*here I am*."Eleni moved past Alex, the skirt of her stola brushing his legs.She too looked down from Aspda's colossal wall onto the titan's body on the endless plane."He will be alive again, soon.""Yes," Alex replied, moving beside her."Only to be crucified again.Only to be eaten alive by those *creatures*."It took Alex a moment to reply, his gaze distant."Yes.""Every moonrise.Can you imagine the pain he suffers?How is it fair -- how can the other Gods allow it?He only tried to help his children."Alex sighed and lowered his head."Those that he tried to help, they weren't any God's children.""*He* believed they were -- it's why he went out there.We -- *mankind* -- are all his children.He sculpted us from the clay of the Earth.Stole fire from Zeus for us - he..."

"I know what he did for us!"Alex snapped, slamming his fists against the rough brick of the wall."You don't need to tell me.But *they*"--he pointed to the ocean of crucifixes in the distance--"weren't his children.They left the Gods, and when they did, they forfeit any right to be protected by them.They chose instead to pursue only the pleasures that the God's provided for them in the first place.They are traitors!Prometheus was a traitor, too -- to the Gods.To *us*."Alex took a deep breath; his voice lowered as he became calm again, turning to almost a whisper."*He deserves his punishment*.""I know you don't believe that, Alex.Not truly."Eleni turned away from the wall to face the long haired man who looked more pained now than he had ever done in life."There are many out there, they say.In camps much less than this, with no Gods to protect them.Not traitors without faces, but real *men, women and children*."Alex sighed; his shoulders fell and the breath left his stomach, as if a gift taken back by the Gods."I know there are others.*Of course I do!*.But what can I do?The Gods think him a traitor -- if I help him, I become one too.""Then let us be traitors together!"Alex put a finger to his lips."Hush!That is foolishness to say out-loud -- if we are heard..."

"**Gods be damned!** -- they are not worth our prayers," Eleni spat.Alex strode to Eleni and put a hand over her mouth."Say such things again and we will both be killed!"Eleni slowly pulled Alex's hand away from her lips."In life, you cowed before no man nor God.*Please*.At least speak to Epimetheus.""Epimetheus?He has no love for his brother -- or for me, for that matter!He loves only his precious animals.*They* are his children."Eleni took both Alex's hands in her own."I don't think that's true -- it's just what he likes others to believe.Still waters run deep, Alex."She pressed one of his olive skinned hands against her chest.Alex opened his mouth to respond."I-"

A gruff yell rang out from below."Alex, are you up there?Alex!"Alex looked at Eleni for a moment; let his eyes meet hers and linger.Then, he broke away and called down to his friend."Yes, Idaeus!And Eleni is up here with me.""Well get your asses to the temple," Idaeus replied."The last sun is about to set and Dionysus wants to give a speech to put some courage into our apparently *cowardly* spines.And you know how long winded his rambles can be..."

"Hah!Well, at least there'll be wine, brother.That's where the real courage comes from!""Plenty of it too, I should hope!""We'll be along shortly, Idaeus.Go ahead without us."Alex waited until the sound of his friend's feet on the cobblestone path below, faded into silence.Then he leaned in towards Eleni, his mouth at her ear and whispered in a shaky voice."You are right.He was the best of us, and was the best of them.I will do it."Eleni nodded."Will you speak to Epimetheus?"she asked."Nay.I will do this alone.Tonight, while they have a skin-full to celebrate the start of the new moon, I will ride to the field of corpses.When the first moon hangs full, he will breathe again.That is my chance.""*Our* chance," Eleni corrected him."No!You can't come with me.The creatures may be wandering the plane by then, searching for their next meal.""Listen to me, Alex.I don't want to live here eternally, if it is without you.I'm coming too."Alex clenched his jaw and was ready to object.*But...* he knew it would do no good.It never did.He sighed and let himself relax."If we leave -- even if we free him -- we can't return here.We'll be outcasts.Left to fend for ourselves.""Yes.But we will have done something worthwhile for once in our lives, besides drinking and feasting; besides worshipping deities who don't give a damn about us -- who only keep us for worship, and for the strength we give back to them."For a while, they stood together in silence, holding hands, as the last drips of sunlight fell away, revealing the dark chalice beneath."They say," said Eleni, "there are other cities out there.Other Gods.Perhaps we won't be so alone.""Perhaps," replied Alex."Perhaps Prometheus can lead us to such a place, if we succeed in saving him.Perhaps there are Gods more worthy of worship than our own, somewhere out there.And if not..."--he smiled forlornly at Eleni--"then we'll become our own.We'll create a new settlement.*Gods be damned.*"

He leaned forward and pressed his lips against Eleni's."Come," he said softly."We must at least make an appearance at the temple, or Zeus help us both."

"What does he mean *quarantine?*" huffed the elderly lady next to me, her voice high in indignant exasperation."We've already been on the ground for four hours -  *four hours!* - well, I've had enough.I want to go home.I'll be putting in a complaint!Just you wait and see if I don't.""Try not to worry - it's most likely nothing," I replied, forcing my lips into a broad smile.I could tell that behind her bravado, she was scared."I suspect they're just being cautious.""What would you know about it?"she snapped."My name is Sarah," I explained, "and I'm a doctor."Her face finally relaxed a little, and her breathing began to slow."Well, what did they mean *under quarantine?*" she repeated."If you're a doctor, you must know about diseases."A man with dark hair leaned over to us from a seat on the adjacent aisle."Someone probably tried the on board food," he quipped."I ordered the chicken on the way out there - poor thing didn't look well.Can't say I was feeling great the next day, either."I couldn't help but giggle.The lady next to me didn't find it so amusing."Someone on this plane could have that... *eboola*," she said, horrified the man had had the audacity to joke about the situation."Ebola," I corrected her, "And it's very unlikely - there have been no cases in Egypt, as of yet.Besides, the outbreak is dying down, not growing.""Well, it could be something else - something similar.A worse disease, maybe," she persisted, screwing up her face as if she was chewing on a lemon.She turned her back to me and started rummaging through her bag."Hey," the guy said again."You're a doctor?""Yes.Doctor Sarah Browning - general practitioner," I replied, offering a hand across the aisle."Dan Everett," he said, shaking mine firmly."Seems like the old girl *wants* it to be something serious.You think there's anything in it?""Honestly, I doubt it, but I'm going to go offer my services to the crew," I replied, already unbuckling my belt."I'll come with you," he said."I'm a police officer back home - I might be of some use, if things get rowdy."The elderly lady turned to face me again, a frown plastered on her face."They said to remain in our seats!"Dan joined me in the aisle and leaned over to the lady."I hear the eboola is in row E already," he said quietly, "and it's moving this way quick."The lady sat upright and her eyes went wide, before she realised Dan was joking."You're an officer?"I asked, a little bemused."Didn't say I was a good one," he grinned."You shouldn't tease her!She might have had a heart attack.Besides, maybe she's right.""About the Eboola?"I rolled my eyes."No, not *ebola,* but there might be something in it."The plane was alive with the sound of loud, confused voices, and as we walked toward the front of the craft, we saw a number of people talking on their phones."Excuse me," Dan said to a teenager who had just finished on his."The person you spoke to - they don't know anything about this, right?""Spoke to?"the kid said."I didn't speak to no one.There's no reception.Hasn't been for a couple of hours"

"But... people are talking on their phones," I said, looking around."Leaving messages.For loved ones," the kid answered.We continued down the aisle until we neared the pilot's cabin.Three attendants were gathered around a large, well tanned man, who seemed to be wrestling with an emergency exit."Let me off!"he yelled, in a thick Brooklyn accent."If there's a sickness on board, I ain't getting it, that's for damn sure."He was pushing against the exit's lever, but it wasn't budging."Please sir," said an attendant, "you don't want to do that!""I sure as shit do," he grunted, leaning down on the handle."It won't open," said another attendant."The plane's on quarantine lock-down.Besides, you wouldn't want to leave.""The hell I wouldn't!"The man tried once more, his head turning purple and veins popping up on his forehead like a road network.Dan walked up to him, gently placed his hands on his shoulders, and pulled him away."Don't worry, buddy," he said."It's going to be fine.It's all just precautionary.""Excuse me," I said to the third attendant."Can you give us any more details about what's transpiring.""She's a doctor," Dan butted in, leaving the Brooklyn man panting on a chair."She might be able to help the guy who's sick."No one's sick," she said.It was then I saw how pale and sullen her pallor was.That I noticed the sweat trickling down her face in rivulets.All three attendants looked... not *sick*, exactly - more just, anxious."What do you mean?"I queried."We're on lock-down and the plane's under quarantine.*Someone's* got to be ill - or at least, suspected of being ill."

"That's what we've been trying to tell the other gentleman," said the attendant."We've just heard from the pilot.People are sick - *very sick* - nearly everyone, from what we know.But not us, yet.Not the people on board.""Wh- what?"I said, my arm's trembling.A moment later, I felt the plane start to rock slightly, as if it was experiencing very gentle turbulence - but, we were still on the tarmac.I went to a window in time to see twenty or so people running and crawling toward the plane.Their eyes were open wide and red dribble was running down from their mouths."Jesus Christ," I whispered.Dan pressed his face to the window as I pulled away."What the hell are they?""The reason we're on lock-down," said the third attendant."How secure are we?"I asked."We're safe, as long as we-"

She was interrupted by a tremendous thump, followed by a scream that came from half way down the aisle."It's on the wing!"someone shouted."It's headbutting the fucking window.""Please!"shouted the second attendant, walking down the aisle toward the event."Everybody stay in your seats.There is no way through the... *oh shit*."The creature's neck snapped as the glass shattered, and it fell down limp.Other creatures, all dribbling blood, began clambering over it and pulling themselves in through the broken window."Stay behind me," said Dan, removing something from an inside jacket pocket.Passengers began to scream as the creatures hoisted themselves through the opening, and tore into the necks of the nearest people, who had been too slow to run.Dan had a gun in his hand and was trying to find an aim."A gun?"was all I could get out."Airline security," he replied, as a tidal wave of terrified people ran down the aisle towards us."Shit," he said."I can't shoot with them in the way."He holstered his weapon and turned to the pilot's door, slamming his fists against it."Hey," he yelled, "let us the fuck in!We're all going to die if you don't!"Passengers pressed tightly against us, and I struggled desperately for breath.

Michael stepped as far back from the door as he could without falling down the stairs, before suddenly hurtling towards it like a bull seeing red.As he ran, he pictured the door splintering and him falling through it, back into the pit beyond; he could almost hear Jules praising him for saving them all.Feel her red lips on his.He wondered what she tasted like.Reality arrived with a dull *thud* a moment later, as he collided with the wood and was sent staggering back clutching his shoulder."Will you stop it, you idiot," said Juliet."Every time you do that, you're losing brain cells, and you *really* can't afford to.""Feels like it's made of iron," Michael complained, rubbing his shoulder."I would have been through any normal door ages ago.""It's my fault anyway," said Juliet regretfully."I only meant to close it to stop the dust getting in.I've no idea how it locked.""We're going to die in here, aren't we?"muttered Christopher."No one is dying," Juliet answered."Look, maybe it *is* the wind howling down there.Maybe there's another way out.Whatever it is, we need to go down there and-"

"No fricking way," Christopher cut in, "am I going into the... *Well of Souls*.What if that's not the wind?What if it's something that wants *my* soul?What then?""I'll come with you, Jules," said Michael, moving to the girl's side."I don't believe in ghosts.Chris, you wait here until us adults return."Christopher's mouth dropped open."I... On second thought, you might need me down there.Might be more Latin that needs translating.""Yeah, that's just what we need if we run into an army of ghosts.Someone who can ask them how their day's going.""Okay, it's decided," said Juliet, already walking towards the first step."We're all going.Pass me the phone, Michael.I'll go first and light the way.You two follow close behind."Michael paused, wondering whether or not to give her the device.He liked how it felt in his hand.But, all things considered, he didn't really fancy being at the front of the group as they descended."Here, catch," he said, tossing the phone to Juliet.The beam of the flashlight caught Juliet in the eye as the phone rotated in mid air.There was a sharp *crack* at the same time as the light went out, and then the sound of plastic parts skidding over the stone ground.It was followed by a moment of overwhelming silence."We're screwed!"said Christopher, as three voices erupted out of the darkness all at once."Why did you throw it, you absolute idiot!"Juliet shouted."Why didn't you catch it?Michael retorted."Absolutely screwed.""How could I catch it?I was blinded by the flashlight!""Even Bill Buckner could have caught that?""Who the hell is Bill Buckner?""Jesus Christ."Juliet drew in a deep breath."All right," she said as she exhaled."Let's calm down.There's no point in us fighting - what's done is done.Let me think.""Doesn't matter now, anyway," said Christopher."Do you want to be a bit more positive?"Juliet asked."Now give me a moment."Juliet closed her eyes as Christopher and Michael went silent.Somewhere in the distance below, they could hear the eerie sound of the wind -- or whatever it was -- howling."*Christopher*," came a deep rumble from somewhere around them.It felt like it came from the walls themselves.The tiny hairs on Christopher's neck stood up."Christopher," it came again."You must be sacrificed on my rock, by your friends.Only then will they be allowed to go."Christopher tried to scream, but nothing came out.His arms began to shake.He could feel his heart pressing against his rib cage as it tried to burst free."Christopher," it continued."You will-

"Cut it out, Michael!"Juliet yelled."Sheesh, just trying to have a little fun.It was funny, right, Chris?""Y-yeah.Very," he said in a whisper."Don't tell me you bought it?""N-no.""You seriously thought that was a ghost?Oh my god, you so did.I can practically hear your teeth chattering!""Quit it," said Juliet."So okay, here's the plan.We're going to hold hands, and very slowly, very carefully, we're going to creep down the stairs.""You want us to go down into the Well of Souls, in the pitch black?"replied Christopher, his heart still hammering."We don't have a choice.Now hold out your hand, Christopher.Come on!Okay, yeah, I've got it.Now hold hands with Michael and we'll go down, backs against the wall so we can feel any curves.""I'm not holding his hand," said Michael."Me neither," replied Christopher."Jesus Christ, you two are so childish.Okay fine, Michael, come to the front.I'll go in the middle.""Fine," Michael said, not really wanting to."Suits me," said Christopher.Michael got to the front and found Juliet's hand.He pulled her arm lightly."I'm ready," he said."Okay then.Go."Michael crept down the stairs, making sure he could feel the wall at his side.He dangled one foot out at a time, exploring for the next step down as if his leg was the beam from a lighthouse."It's winding," said Christopher."Like a corkscrew.You can feel the wall bending.And that noise... the wailing, it's getting louder."No one replied.Christopher began to count the steps in his head.Twelve... thirteen...He'd made it all the way up to thirty nine when Michael's excited voice came."Do you guys see that?There's a light coming from around the bend down there!""I see it," replied Juliet in a hushed voice."It's flickering.Like... a fire or something.I think we should all be silent until we know what's down there."Christoper counted another fifteen steps, all the while the light around them was becoming brighter, more intense.There was a heat wafting up the stairs now.It took another five steps for them to reach the bottom."Well I guess we know what wailing noise was now," said Michael, as they stepped out into a huge, stone chamber."Water."The walls along their left were lit by dozens of torches burning on the walls, but to the right side of the chamber was a massive, underground lake.On the water's edge sat a little wooden boat, that looked a bit like a woven basket, only with a wooden hut built onto the centre of its deck.It was bobbing up and down contently on the water."Is that..." Christopher began, his voice faltering."It can't be," said Michael, knowing what Christopher was thinking."That's impossible.Besides, it's way too small.""Guys," said Juliet, her voice trembling."Look over there and tell me I'm dreaming.*Please.*

They turned together and saw it at the same time.There was a desk, half way down the cavern.A massive wooden desk, with huge lengths of scrolls dangling over the edge and onto the floor around it.At the desk, on a small chair, sat a bearded skeleton.Its face lay down on the desk, its left arm limp by its side.But its right arm was moving.It was writing on the scrolls.---

In front of us, endless rivers of books darted past, carried along by powerful mechanical undercurrents."There are *so many* books!"I yelled, cupping my hands around my mouth so as to be heard over the tremendous whirling and clicking of the conveyors."Where are they going?"Jessica furrowed her brows."Where ever they need to go, of course!"she shouted back."They're not all *ours*, are they?"I asked.I'd already noticed a handful of strange looking square volumes as we'd climbed down from the tunnel; they'd wobbled gelatinously as they'd drifted by."No.They're not just *our* books.In fact, very, very few are - a *Lilliputian* amount," she said grinning."We're going to need to cross here - follow me."Jessica hauled herself up onto the silver edge of the nearest conveyor, then lowered a hand to help me up.The conveyor that blocked our path was about ten foot wide and carried an endless supply of curious looking books; books of every conceivable colour and texture.They flew past at a breakneck speed - too fast to make out any finer details."Watch me," she instructed.With a careless, practised ease, she hopped forward onto a small red volume.From there, she dexterously skipped across the books as if they were stepping stones.Before I knew it, she was standing opposite me, beckoning me across."Come on!Step on the larger ones - it'll be easier for you.Try to go against the current."I nodded, then looked back down the conveyor.A bright, purple hardback caught my attention; it was hurtling towards me and I only had a second to think.I took a quick breath, and jumped - then onto a brown leather tome; then an orange; then a green and then - *no* - there was nothing near enough for me to jump to!I had mistimed my jumps and was stranded half way across the conveyor.Worse still, I was being rapidly pulled away from Jessica.She began to run."JUMP!"I heard her scream.She was sprinting along side me on the conveyor-belt's edge, desperately trying to keep up."JUMP!"Underneath the rumble of the machinery, I could hear an urgency in her voice.She stretched out a hand towards me, but it was too far away for me to reach."Oh God."I swallowed hard, swung my arms forward and jumped.Jessica snatched at my flailing hands, somehow managing to grab hold of one.She forcefully pulled me towards her - it was enough to get me over the belt, but my momentum kept me going, throwing me against her.We both tumbled over the edge and fell in a ball onto the hard floor below."You idiot!"she said, as she began to catch her breath.She pushed me off her and got to her feet."Do you know what would have happened if you'd stayed on it?""I thought I did pretty good, for my first time," I replied, forcing a smile.Underneath my bravado, my heart was beating a furious rhythm."And no, I have no idea what would have happened - because you don't tell me very much."She sighed."Come on.It's not much further."---

The books on the next conveyor-belt were much more sparsely spaced and all appeared to be identical."This is where we get on," Jessica said.A gigantic black tome, at least as long as I was tall, floated by us.Jessica pointed to it, "those books there.The black ones.They're the ones the Great Hands take.They're our ride.""Where do the... *Hands*, take them?""To the beginning.To the very *first* books.I think the black tomes are sacred to *them*.""*Them?* Who are *them*?Can you please just tell me that?""Listen, you wanted to know more about this place; I'm going to *show* you.All you have to do is get on one of those black books, and lie very flat and very still.Simple.The Great Hands will do the rest.""Okay.I guess that doesn't sound too bad.""And hold on for your life.""Oh..." 

She laughed."Look, if you fall off, find another black book like that one, and get back on.Or, if you want to get back here, look for the leathery brown books on the sixth conveyor."Another huge, dark tome was rapidly approaching us."You go first.See you soon," she smiled.I nodded, bit my lip and readied myself.A moment later I was lying flat against one of the massive volumes.I looked back to see Jessica climbing onto another, someway behind me.A few uneventful minutes passed, and I slowly began to relax.Then like an unannounced storm, I saw *it* heading towards me.It moved in a metallic blur, rapid and purposeful, and within seconds, was hovering above me."Oh God," I uttered, as it opened its silver fist, revealing huge, twisted fingers.They shot down towards me.I wrapped my arms and legs tightly around the tome, and closed my eyes.---

He was only thirteen when I wormed my way inside,     
Us both only searching, for the safest place to hide.Crushed flowers from the funeral clung tightly to his boots,     
His mind already churning to the darkness of his suit.I tried to keep him safe, beneath the covers of his bed,     
I tried to hush the thoughts, that screeched inside his head.At school they taunted him, as he ate his lunch alone,     
But with my help he kept it in, expression never shown.I taught him how alcohol could help to numb the pain,     
That sleep was so wasteful, no hope from dreams to gain.When education failed him, I was there to catch,     
Wormed my way in deeper, through a rusting hatch.When the state declared him, fit to be employed,     
I dragged him deeper, inside the safety of the void.It was a therapist that found me, on a dull October day,     
We were both still thirteen, at least in a certain way.A rancid rotting mind, trapped inside a fractured heart,     
Two weary vessels waiting for their tickets to depart.He scribbled a prescription, said it might alleviate,         
Might make it bearable, the burden of the freight.And although the pills now numb me,     
and I slowly fade away,               
I'll wait inside the recesses,            
for him, I'll always stay.Hidden in the darkness,      
for the darker day.

How she got there, he didn't know.But there she was, one endless night, on the other side of the nanoglass panel.The first soul he'd seen in half his life.It took him a while to move toward her, but when he realised it wasn't a twisted reflection, he nervously pressed his palms against the glass.She reciprocated the gesture, touching the glass on her side and looking curiously at his bearded face.His smile didn't drop for two days -  his cheeks ached but his soul danced.He knew they could never break the nanoglass, that they could never really touch - but he thanked God he wasn't alone any longer.They communicated with pen and paper, holding up questions and excitedly scribbling answers.His name was Thomas, her name was Ophelia.Her shuttle had been damaged and she had crash landed into the other side of the station.He had been born there, his parents long since dead.For all they knew, they were the final embers of humanity.They met up for hours each day.He had a chess set and she wrote her moves for him to make.She usually let him win.On her birthday, he decorated the glass with ribbons and blew up rubber tubes as industrial balloons.He baked a cake - as well as he could - and used a flare as a candle; she clapped, and her smile was to him, brighter than any star.They danced that night, to different songs but to the same melody.They slept next to each other, their bodies touching, if not for the thin pane of glass between them.When the station picked up the message - that the trail of Ophelia's vessel had been noticed, and people were coming to rescue them - they celebrated again, knowing that in ten years time, they would finally touch; that they would finally hear one another's voices; discover each other's scent; taste each other's lips.He had shaven, the day he pressed the rusty ring against the window.She wept and nodded, and cut a plastic ring from a plastic tube she'd found.She ran it along her finger and made her vows on recycled paper with a scratchy, red pen.They danced and dreamed and loved and waited.When he found out that the oxygen tank was leaking, he patched it as  well as he could.But four years was all that remained for them both, and that was too little.The ship would still take seven to arrive.He told Ophelia what he would do.He said it was an easy decision; she said she'd rather have four together, than forever without - but he couldn't be swayed.He would die for Ophelia.When the shuttle arrived at the abandoned station, the crew found two bodies lying next to each other, separated only by a thin screen, their ringed hands stretched out toward each other.A plastic ring on her finger, a rusty metal on his.

When Martin was six he saw the stars for the first and final time.There had been a power cut, and he'd sat on top of the apartment roof, and gazed open mouthed at the beauty that hung above.The stars were so plentiful, it seemed to Martin that God must have knocked over a jar of sugar, spilling the tiny, sweet crystals all over the heavens.They almost didn't look real.He hugged Edward closer to his body, snuggling deep into the fluffy bear, as harp-strings of gentle moonlight bathed them both.The city lights soon blinked back to life and snuffed out the wondrous scene far above, but it was too late - it had ignited a fire inside him that could not be quenched.The stars had entranced Martin.He would dedicate his life to them.He would learn every secret that they hid.Most importantly of all, he would find a way to bring their beauty back into the world - it would be his gift to humanity.He studied the stars through ancient images.Pictures taken back when the land had been something other than just a sprawling mass of endless cities with ever shifting boundaries; when the sea had been something other than a cancerous-giving dumping ground.He learned their names.He learned of the formations they made: Ursa-Minor and Major, Orion, Hydra - and everything he learned about them was magical.An impossible contradiction to the suffocation of the industrial planet he was trapped on.But what was all his learning for?The space program had long since been discontinued.The stars had been taken away from him forever.Sometimes, he felt as if he were studying a corpse.Talking to a ghost.There hadn't been another power-cut since he was a child.There was too much at stake; too much money to fall out of someone's pocket.At least, there hadn't been another power cut until *today.* 

There was always light in the city.The glaring, obnoxious sunlight was not much different to the city at night.In a way, the neon-nights were even brighter.He'd met the man in a cheap hotel room, where the carpet was stained with reds that you knew were one thing, but pretended were another.Where paint peeled itself away from the walls in a desperate attempt to escape the dirty hell-hole.The man promised him there would be explosions.Fireworks, he said, as they exchanged money and shook hands.Fireworks.It took Martin months of careful planning to lay the explosives.He replicated the layout of his favourite constellation: Pegasus.A square of bombs around the city, with tendrils of fire leading to the back-up power plants.He decided to watch the event from the top floor of the tallest building he knew, with the trigger waiting excitedly for him in his jacket pocket.He looked up at the sick blackness above, then down at the cancer below that caused it.He took out the trigger, and pressed the cure.The explosions were too far away to see or even hear, but he watched the lights of the city around him as they blinked twice, then died.It would take months for them to come back."Look," he heard hushed, revered voices say, as people around him began pointing above them.He allowed himself a smile, as he too looked toward the heavens.Only, something wasn't right.The moon shouldn't be flickering.Neither should the stars.It took only a moment for them too, to blink out of existence and leave the city in an abyss of darkness.Of despair.There were no stars, Martin realised.Not for him

There never had been.Just... a kind of *backup.*

Screams began to rise from the city floor, far below him.He couldn't see the blood that was already smearing and slicking the streets, but he could sense it.Smell it.Something was free.The lights had all gone out.And he'd set something free.

The corridor we'd come out on was exceptionally dark; it took our eyes sometime to adjust enough to even see the other's silhouette.A flashing light far above us occasionally punctuated the oppressive gloom, momentarily revealing towering stacks of dusty black books.These volumes were not on shelves - there were *no* shelves here.These were, instead, piled on top of each other, the towers rising far above us.Another spasm of light momentarily lit the gargantuan piles - like an engulfing burst of lightning illuminating skyscrapers on a moonless night.What is this place? I asked Jessica.I moved slowly towards her silhouette, careful not to touch anything, for fear of toppling a tower and it falling upon us.The Corridor of the Old Gods, she replied quietly.Come on,  I've got to show you something. She took my hand and led me along the passage.---

The Great Hand had come down on me like a bird's talon expertly snatching up a garden worm.It hooked itself around the sides of the book, its metal palm pressing slightly against me.In no time at all it had ascended high, book firmly in its grip, me firmly on the book - my stomach still somewhere far below.For the next few minutes, I desperately hung to my book for dear life.My knuckles were white from exertion and my calves were shaking with fatigue.After finally becoming *somewhat* numbed to the ridiculous speed, I began to relax a little.Gingerly, I poked my head over the edge of the book and stole a glance down.Below, I noticed that there was some type of  *order,* to the seemingly manic chaos of the Sorting Room.The conveyor-belts, sooner or later, all looped into huge, hexagonal shaped huts.They continued out the other side, but the books they had been transporting did not.However, the empty conveyor-belts were soon replenished by a sprawling system of shoots that moved from belt to belt, firing books onto them.Absorbed in the scene below, I was taken by surprise when the arm that held me came to an abrupt halt.*Had it realised it was carrying a stowaway?*

Over here! 

I looked behind me to see Jessica, still lying firm on the black book Id seen her climb onto.She didn't seem concerned about the stoppage.The Great Hands must be in some kind of queue, I thought.Jessica grinned at me.Enjoying the ride?

Its a blast! I shouted back in reply.I'm going to book in again sometime.

Look, she said, ignoring my remark.No hands! She let go of her book and raised her arms out in front.Not to be outdone, I removed my hands from my great tome.Eas- my words turned into a scream as the Great Hand took off again, in a new direction.Through my howling, I was sure I could hear Jessica laughing.An hour or so  later, the Hand arrived at its destination - the mouth of a wide, green tube.It hovered over the maw for half a second, before unburdening itself.I clung more tightly than ever to the black tome as I plunged into darkness.Watch out below! came Jessicas reverberating warning.A moment later, the tube spat her out next to me.---

Corridor of the Old Gods, I repeated in a whisper - even said quietly, the words made me shiver.We walked hand in hand for a number of hours.The corridor occasionally split open into many possible paths, but even in the dark, Jessica seemed sure of her way.I suspected shed walked this route at least a dozen times before.Have you always been alone here, Jessica? I enquired, as the light above us flickered in staccato heartbeat.In the momentary light, I thought I saw a sadness in Jessicas face.Melancholy.But, perhaps it was just the light playing tricks, as she sounded as upbeat as usual when she spoke.Am I ever alone, with all these books?All these *stories*, and *characters* and *ideas*!I have a bigger family than anyone!

But I began, I mean, have you ever had any friends, like *me*?

I saw her silhouetted head nod slowly.We walked in silence for a time, as I considered her reply.Were here! she finally exclaimed, excitement sparking her words like electricity.Welcome, to the Library of the Old Gods.

The corridor had led into a large, circular room, built like a Colosseum.We were at the bottom and were surrounded by staggered layers of floors, each filled with dusty, wooden bookshelves.The room was better lit than the passageway we'd come from, although, not *much* better lit.There was an object in the centre of the room; a large, wooden stand, and on it sat one of the huge black books that we had earlier ridden.Jessica let go of my hand as we approached it.As I drew closer, I realised the book wasn't *quite* like the others.There was writing on the front of this volume, not that I could interpret it.What is it? I asked.Read it.

I looked at her as though she was strange.I cant.I dont even recognise the letters. 

Try again, she said encouragingly.Whats the point?

Please!

Slightly frustrated, I looked back at the great book.Nothing made sense.There were some marks that looked a *little* like letters - I even noticed one of them repeated itself, but in a different colouring.Mostly though, the book was adorned with strange, fascinating symbols.I gently ran a finger across the books bobbled surface.Its no good, I cant re- I paused, noticing that something very odd was happening.The letters had started to shift; the symbols were rearranging themselves.*What* I looked at Jessica, mystified, and then back at the book.It was fully comprehensible to me now.Slowly, I read the words out loud.>**Kualio, The Librarian**

It was only a cat.The blood that matts its fur looks like jam.Like, it rolled around in a big puddle of strawberry jam and never got back up.When do dead things become a carcass?Do dead people become carcasses, or is that just for animals?I don't know, but this cat is just a carcass now, I suppose.Just a feast for flies and a cozy home for maggot eggs.A lot of people killed someone.Like, an actual person.Sarah Golding did.Got her dad's gun and went up to Mr Sanding, the teacher who felt her up at prom.*I got something to show you,* she said with that smile that melts older men's hearts like butter, with her hands hidden behind her back.*Close your eyes*, she said.**Bang,** the gun yelled.Big chunks of brain flew all over his friends, and his wife, into their eyes and even into one guy's mouth.She regrets it.Can't sleep now for fear of nightmares.Says it's not fair she didn't die -- that we '*averted*' the collision.I don't think she should regret it.I share her nightmares, about the brains and blood -- only, they don't scare me.It's not like I like them...I just don't mind them, is all.It stinks.Like, its insides must be all rotting.It's like sewage.When I prod it with my boot, pus oozes out of its wounded, rotting flesh, and flies take angrily to the air, buzzing around me wishing they were wasps.It feels like kicking a bag of liquid.Sounds like it too, as it squidges and sloshes under my foot.People did worse than murder, so they say.I don't know much about that.Dad won't let me watch the tv, and it's not like there's internet anymore.You can't help wonder though: what's worse than murder?Sarah says living.Why don't I feel like her?I know it was only a dumb moggy, but it was Mr Herrington's, and he loved it.Not that I'll tell him where it is.It's mine now.I killed it.**I** own it.I told Sarah she should be proud of herself.That I wish I'd had the courage to kill a real person.She didn't ask, but I told her anyway.My dad.He never touched me or anything, like that teacher did her.It was other stuff.Small things.Like, on the rare occasions when he'd take me for ice cream or something, he was more interested in the waitresses' asses than how my netball went.I never played.I wouldn't have told him if he'd asked.But he didn't.I wouldn't have told him that I just sat on the bench, cause I never got picked.Just sitting there, rocking back and forth like a piece of jello.But he didn't.A black eyeball plops out this time, as the tip of my boot rocks the cat's head.The *carcass'* head.It's not a cat anymore.I wonder what it'd be like if that was a person's head.How it would feel.I wonder if something's wrong with me.Why I'm not like Sarah and don't feel all that shit she does.But I know the answer.It was only a cat.

This story is based on the following prompt: [WP] A few selected minds are gifted with a dream about the "Library of all Books".In only one night, they experience a full year of reading and learning.You are one of them, but instead of once in a lifetime, you wake up in this f*cking library every single night.Today is your 9th birthday.---

Before I'd even opened my eyes, I knew that I was back in the limbo-land that I so dreaded.The smell of the ancient tomes and parchments, that used to remind me of almonds and vanilla, now brought to mind the confines of a musty prison cell.Solitary.I'd tried so hard to stay awake - three tortuous weeks.Three weeks of caffeine and migraines and pain, only to end back here, again.I'd spent most of my life in this accursed library, but that didn't mean it was my home.Reluctantly, I forced my eyes to open.I was lying on a cold, stone floor in a grand corridor; dark panelled walls were mostly hidden behind sprawling rows of packed bookshelves.Above the shelves, at the top of the wooden panels themselves, carved illustrations depicted winged beasts waging a terrible battle.The books that lined the shelves had been placed there haphazardly, some jarringly put back with their spines facing away from me.There was always a particular lure to those books, the promise of *the unknown*.Perhaps one of them might explain this dream world, I thought.Perhaps one held the secret that would get me home.I'd been here so many times before - every time I'd fallen asleep, since I was five years old.The first few visits, I'd read books to entertain myself and to whittle away the almost endless time.But when I realised that I could recall the words I'd read, upon waking, I had an idea.I would read the books that held *real* knowledge; I'd become clever - I'd learn more than any person had ever known.So, I tried to read them all.With time on my side, and a fierce motivation burning in my belly, I began.I'd been fastidious with my planning.I'd start with the bookshelf I'd woken next to, and work my way through them *all*, until I got to the end.Only, there had been no *end*.I'd read and read until I'd forgotten all that I'd learned from the first book.I realised in that moment that there was far more knowledge here than was possible for me to absorb.For a *human* to absorb.And I knew also, with an unshakable, terrifying certainty, that this place wasn't meant for *us*.As always, I had little choice but to walk on or to read.I decided on the former.The corridor in front of me twisted and dipped like a crooked corkscrew, but I followed it, forward and downward.Always forward.Always downward.The days turned into weeks and the weeks...I promised myself that I wouldn't stop; that I wouldn't read a single, pointless book - I'd only walk.I'd walk until I found *something*, or I awoke.I can't say how many months I'd spent wandering the lonely corridors by the time I reached *it* - perhaps three, perhaps more.All the while, the carved battle of the winged-creatures raged on above me.Finally, the corridor bent back into a u-turn, and a wave of disappointment washed over me; it was going to take me back in the direction I'd come from.But I followed it reluctantly, and to my great surprise and consternation, the corridor soon *ended*.A single book shelf stood in front of me - books with wrinkled leather spines, quite unlike all the others.They smelled differently, too, but not in a pleasant way.There was something *grotesque* about the smell.But I hardly noticed, being far more amazed that this world had an end - at least, of a type.I removed a leather bound volume from the shelf.The cover simply read "Sarah".I opened it.There were no words on the pages, but there didn't need to be.The pages were made of a strange, rubber-like material, with rich blue veins running through them - almost as if it were- 

I knew then that the book was made of Sarah's skin.I flung it to the floor in utter disgust.My body attempted to throw up, but there was nothing to come out of me.Feeling dizzy and nauseous, I collapsed onto the stone floor below.Every other book I'd opened - *ever* - had been on history, or geography or some other banal subject.After an hour or so, the dizziness subsided and I, fortifying myself against the horrors, picked out another book."Nathaniel," "Chloe," Esther."They were all... *someone* - or at least, had been.I removed a few more volumes, discarding them in a heap behind me.That was when I saw the *red* behind the bookshelf.There was something tantalisingly different hidden back there.I hurriedly removed more books, tossing them from the shelf.Finally, I saw it for what it was.A dull, red door.Metal and rusted.A door!The empty shelf in front was too large for me to move, but it still obstructed the door.I crawled onto a now-empty shelf adjacent to the handle, and wriggled my way towards it.As my hand touched the cold metal handle, a voice called out from behind."For Gods sake - don't!"The voice was lilting and high, but there was no mistaking it for what it was.*It was a warning.*

They watched the bearded skeleton as its hand swept back and forth across the scroll in front of it, its head resting motionless on the table.Occasionally, the arm would pause, dipping the feather quill it held in its fingers, into a well that they could not see.Then, it would continue in its task.Its its arm whispered Michael.Do you think its *alive*? asked Juliet.Like, its a person?

Whatever it is, its writing something on those scrolls, said Christopher.Dead things dont write.Right?

None of them dared move.Instead they stood transfixed, watching the skeleton, listening to it as it scratched words onto the ancient yellow parchment on the desk.Juliet took a deep breath.As bizarre as it was, the caverns smell suddenly reminded her of last years holiday to Florida.Of being down by the beach with her little brother, just as storm had left; the smell of the ocean - the salt and brine; the sharp freshness of the sea.But that wasnt right.There was no smell like that in all of landlocked Missouri.She looked out at the body of water to her right, but beyond the boat the water was invisible, hidden by shadows as the light of the torches surrendered to the darkness of the cavern.It was impossible to say how big the cavern even was; how far out the water stretched.She could hear it *swishing* as it lapped against the cave and the boat.*There was a tide.*

Go on, Michael hissed at Christopher, go speak to him in that dead language of yours.Ask him to open the door so we can get the hell out of here. Michael pushed Christopher forward; the boy stumbled, almost falling but just managing to steady himself in time.Christopher turned around, his face a mix of fear and indignant-rage.Are you trying to get me killed?We have no idea what that thing is, or wants, or does to people!Maybe it wants my soul so that it gets young again - or maybe - or maybe it just wants to eat my skin and and- Christopher suddenly realised how pale Michael had become.How wide Juless eyes were.Then he heard the cracking and clicking behind him.Guys? he said, his voice quivering as he slowly turned.The skeleton was sitting up at its desk, back straight against its chair.It was still scribbling something with its right hand, but its head was turned and it was *staring* straight at them.They all heard the sound of Christopher gulping.I think its looking at you, whispered Michael, nodding at Christopher.*Me?* Whys- whys it looking at me?How- how can you even tell?Its got no eyeballs.

Juliet said nothing, only able to stand and watch as the skeleton raised an arm.She saw a huge spider scuttle across a web between the arm bones, and another, with legs as thick as twigs, crawl out of the creatures eye socket.The skeleton slowly unfurled a bony fist.A slender index finger pointed at them; the arm twisted around and the finger gestured for them to come closer.I think it wants you to go up to it, Michael said, pushing Christopher forward again.Uh-uh, Christopher replied, taking a few hurried steps back.I think it wants you.

The creature opened its mouth and they saw the uneven, jagged teeth lining the jaw.Then came the scream.The cavern shook as the sound of a thousand voices erupted in unison; a thunderous, torturous scream .Christopher covered his ears, as his own yell joined the dreadful cacophony.As quickly as it came, the terrible noise died away, leaving only echoes reverberating around them.The skeleton gestured them forward again."I think we should all go to it, Juliet said."*Together.*"

No objections here, Michael replied.Im pretty sure we dont want to piss it off any more than we already have done.

Christopher could only nod.He could feel the warm wetness of tears dribbling down his cheeks.His legs felt like overcooked spaghetti and he struggled just to stay upright.Juliet took his hand and together, they walked towards the skeleton.Okay, said Michael, stopping only a few feet from the thing.I think thats close enough.

The creature cocked its head and gestured again.Guess not, said Juliet.Shit.

They took another step forward.Then another.Finally, only inches from the table, the creature lowered its head and nodded.Christopher could smell death on it.Mould and mildew, wrapped up in a fetid stench that made him want to puke.What- what do you want? Juliet asked.Another noise left the creature's mouth.A sound that started as a whisper, but as it touched the caverns walls, was joined by other voices, thickening and growing into something inhuman.Whats it saying? Jules asked, looking across at Christopher.I- I dont know.Its not speaking Latin.

Well, whats it speaking? 

I dont know!Hebrew maybe?But I dont think so.It sounds old.Like, really old.The words sound kinda guttural.

Guttral?

The voices stopped and the skeleton became silent and still, as if waiting for a reply.Michael looked at Christopher; Christopher shrugged.He then looked at Jules, then finally at the ancient being in front.We dont understand you, said Michael very slowly, over pronouncing each word.The skeleton remained silent.Non intelligitis, Christopher whispered.Thats the Latin for I dont understand.*Try that!*

Uh *non intelligitis*, Michael said, tapping his chest with a finger.Us, non intelligitis.

The skeleton turned its head slightly, until it was staring directly at Michael.Look, said Juliet, pointing at the creatures feet.Do you see that?

A patch of bright white light had begun building at the creature's feet.As they watched, the light started to crawl up its leg bones, fizzing and crackling as it creeped upward.It ran along its thighs and groin and ribs, eventually reaching the the skeletons throat; the light shot out of it like a firework, jumping straight inside Michaels gaping mouth.Michaels legs gave away and he collapsed onto the floor.The skeleton's body fell forward limply onto the desk but for its right hand that continued to scribble on the scroll.Michael! screamed Juliet, falling to her knees beside him.His eyes were shut fast.It took Christopher a moment longer than Juliet to react, still half stunned by what had happened.He scrambled to Michaels side and nudged his shoulder.Michaels eyes remained closed.Please, Juliet begged, stroking Michaels long, dark hair.Please be okay.*Please!* Tears ran down her face.Christopher put his head to Michaels chest.Hes still breathing.Hes alive.Hes alive! 

Thank God- Juliet began, before they both jumped away from the body, as Michael suddenly jerked upright.Juliet glanced at Christopher who was breathing hard and looked close to another asthma attack.Michael? Juliet whispered.Are you okay?

Michael said nothing.For a moment, he simply sat upright, his eyes shut.When his eyes finally flicked open, revealing beaming, white pupils, Juliet realised it wasnt Michael she was speaking to.Michaels mouth opened very slowly.His tongue rolled out, slowly touching his lips as if it was exploring; tasting for the first time in a long, long time.Then, he spoke.The voice came from Michael, but it came too from the skeleton and from the wall itself.Judgement day is coming, the thousand voices said at once.---

Some of the suits would throw a dollar into his hat, like a crumpled confession meant only for the eyes of a priest - as if they could purchase a sordid mockery of absolution from him.Some might give ten, perhaps even a twenty, depending on how their previous evening had turned out.They'd flash their switchblade smiles and maybe spare him a few words of wisdom - "*don't waste it on drink, I know what you guys are like,*" or "*if you want real change, you've got to make it happen yourself, buddy.*" Then they'd twist their necks like vultures, searching for witnesses to their altruism, and be on their way, smug, satisfied and barely able to resist the urge to pat themselves on the back."*You're a real good man, Bobby,*" or "*that guy's going to thank you one day, Katie.*" 

It wasn't the cancer that killed him in the end.He had been diagnosed in early spring - the doctor said he'd just been unlucky - but it was mid-summer when he began his new life.A time when the asphalt sidewalks seemed to be battling their own form of cancer; when plumes of too-warm air drifted languorously up into the endless blue above him, and the ground below boiled and bubbled, gasping for breath.When the stench of diesel mixed with the sweet, honeyed scents of marigolds and dahlias, and forced its way down his throat, stinging and soothing in unfair  measures.*A day*, he'd thought, *I'll be here a day - maybe a week.* It wouldn't take long for someone to reach out and help him.To buy him a meal, a haircut - to help him get off the ground.It *couldn't* take long.He'd been one of them, once.A faceless suit rushing to and fro for reasons that disguised themselves as important, but never really were.Would he have stopped to help?He didn't know.But he was sure his father would have done.That was his certainty; the reason why his plan would work.It might be the only certainty - *the only belief* - he had left to cling onto.His father had been a good man.His money would go to someone like his father.Summer passed, and although his hat had often filled, it had been little more than a woven trashcan for the wealthy to discard their self-loathing, pity and guilt into.To shed their skin but to enable their skeleton to keep on grinning underneath.Eventually, the asphalt calmed, settling into a still sea of charcoal, and the leaves above turned from apple greens to bonfire reds, rustling in the kneading breeze.The streets were filled with macs and umbrellas that sauntered by him, their owners' eyes transfixed on what was in front, not below them; their guilt placated by the autumn drizzle - *can't stop in this rain - he must understand that,* they told themselves, their mouths filled to the brim with coffee and chestnuts and lies.Winter followed in autumn's footsteps and brought with it a tomb-like stillness; the gloom and snow wove together and seemed to garrote the streets.The cold nipped and snapped unmercifully at his toes and numbed his face and fingers.Inside, the cancer had eaten his muscle and fat, and left only a hollowed, haunted man lying under a dirt-brown blanket on the sidewalk, waiting for the world to notice or to care.But fewer people passed him now, none stopping for the bitter chill, and his hat sat as empty as his stomach.The waft of faraway stew encircled him, taunting him, reminding him of the dinner table of his childhood.He could have gone home, and yet the thought never crossed his mind.It would have meant he was wrong about the only thing he was certain of.It wasn't the cancer that killed him in the end.It wasn't even the winter's wrath, or the hypothermia it cast upon him.The group of men thought he might have had money on him - panhandlers often did; maybe he stuffed it into his coat like feathers.He didn't deserve that money, anyway.Their anger boiled into a frothing rage, when they found nothing on him.The red smears of his short crawl were soon covered by night's virgin snow.As his chest rose and fell a final time - as his last breath left his lips, like a misty soul escaping into the moonlit sky - he thought of his father.There was good in the world - of that, he was certain.He had just been unlucky.---

"Tamet!"Illias yelled as he ran towards the door."Tamet!"He froze when he reached the corridor beyond.The candles on the walls, that should have cast out pools of friendly light, had all been extinguished.The corridor was pitch black.But it wasn't the darkness that had made him stop.It was the screaming.The bell had already fallen silent, but somewhere distant, he could hear a terrible sound.Yelling, pleading.Gurgling.Then footsteps.Illias took a step back into the safety of the workshop.The candles here were still lit, and the night's gently glow gleamed through the arched window.The footsteps were growing louder.Illias almost fell as he stepped back against one of the chutes."Tamet..." he said."Is that... Is that you out there?"The man who appeared in front of him was thin and sinewy, but he was dressed in a familiar uniform.A Jupiter house guard.He wondered what a guard from Jupiter was doing up here on Mercury.But the sight of the man with the long dagger strapped around his waist was at least enough chase some of the fear back down Illias's throat."What's going on?"Illias asked."Why did the bell ring?"The guard said nothing.He just looked around with his big beady eyes.Illias noticed how pale he was.And saw the sheen of sweat that covered his skin."What's going on?"Illias repeated.Finally, the guard looked at him."Locked," he said.Gasped."What?""Locked," he repeated."Locked!""You-- you want me to lock the door?""You don't get it!You don't understand.They've locked us all in.*They've left us to die.*"

A shiver skated down Illias's back."Locked us in?"There were more screams now.Louder.Closer."Help me bolt this door, or we're both dead.Maybe if we're quiet, they won't come for us.Maybe they will miss us, or spare us.""There's... there's no lock.At least, no on the inside.Just a bolt on the outside to close off the--"

The guard pulled out his dagger and pointed it forward."Then get out there, and lock me inside."Illias gulped."What about--"

"*Now!*"


~~~~~~


Miri battered her hands against the door until a tall, crooked man pulled her away."Open it!"she demanded."Right now, or I swear to God..."

"I'm sorry, Miri," said the old man."But I can't allow that.""He's your grandchild!Your daughter is down there..."

The old man sighed."I know.But I follow my orders, and I do so for all our good.""So, what?You'll just let them all die?Two entire Houses?!""Miri, if we open that door, we could be sentencing the entire tower to death.Would you prefer that?"Four guards rounded the corner holding a spiral door lengthways in their arms."Put it in place," commanded Gynd."Then seal off the chutes.""You bastard," said Miri, looking up at the old man through bleary eyes.Then she turned, and ran.~~~~~~

"Now!"repeated the guard."Or I will slice you up and use your bones to prop back the door.Do you understand?"Illias nodded.Whatever was out there, he stood a better chance with *it*, than with this psychopath."Holy shit," said a familiar voice somewhere behind him.Illias and the guard both turned to see a plume of dust rising out of the container at the end of chute twenty-eight."Miri?"said Illias, his heart leaping."Is- is he dead?"said Miri, clambering out of the container and off the corpse that rested within it."Who is he?Why is there a dead body in this container?""Who the fuck are you?"snarled the guard."Miri," said Miri."Illias, we've got to go.Like, right now.They've locked you all in with *whatever* is behind the spiral door.""Go?How do you intend go?"asked the guard, suddenly intrigued.Miri nodded at the chute."Back up that way.There's a rope.But... uh...I don't think you're going to fit.I'm sorry.Come on Illias.""He's not going anywhere."Miri finally noticed the dagger that the guard held.How it was pointed at Illias.She walked slowly over to her friend and placed a hand on his shoulder.Illias glanced at her."My parents...I can't leave them.My family.My House..."

"Illias, they're going to block off the chutes.If we stay much longer, we're all dead.Come on."The guard stepped closer.Miri reached into her pocket and took out a stick.It had been carved into a point at one end."Don't move," Miri commanded the guard as she rested the stick on an open palm."You little bitch.You wouldn't dare."The stick began to twitch.It jumped up and down on Miri's palm."Come on Illias.We're going."The guard lunged forward; the stick shot out of miri's hand and plunged deep into his left eye.He screamed as he fell to his knees, before finally collapsing to the floor in silence."Miri..." gasped Illias."You just..."

The stick began to vibrate again, pulling itself back out of the guards head and flying back into Miri's waiting hand.An eyeball had come with it, and it looked up at Illias from Miri's palm.Illias looked back at it, his mouth drooped open.Miri plucked the eyeball off the stick and threw it to the ground."Come on," she said grabbing his hand and pulling him to the chute.But it was too late.There was *clunk.* It had rung through one of the chutes, echoing around the chamber.Another *clunk*.The rope fell down into the container, coiling over the dead body within like a snake .They were trapped.

Katie leaned over her husband, who lay motionless in the bed.She took his hand in her own and brought it to her mouth, kissing it softly."I don't want you to go," she said, as warm tears ran down well worn passages.The heart-rate monitor beeped in a slow staccato that echoed forlornly around the room.Their bedroom had been turned into a hospital ward.The smell was no longer that of laundry and sex and perfume, but bleach and urine and despair.Christian forced his eyes open and tried desperately to smile - to reassure his wife - but only a hint of one formed on his lips.Katie remembered how he used to smile, when they were younger.How his freckles would shift as he did so, like grains of sand dancing in the breeze.His eyes now listless and dim, once a daring, dancing sea-foam green."You'll be okay, honey," he whispered."You always were the stronger of us.""No," she said.The tears became a salty river, trickling into her mouth."I was only strong because I had *you* to make me strong.We got through it all together."He didn't reply.Or couldn't.Katie wasn't sure.She gently lay her head down onto his chest as she wept, avoiding the mishmash of drips and wires that needled into his body.The cross that hung around her neck dangled over her husband's belly.Katie clasped the tiny metal in a single hand and said a silent prayer.She squeezed the cross tightly as she did so, until the metal bit deep into her skin.The tempo of the heart-rate monitor slowed to a crawling adagio."I get..." he gasped, "to die at home.With dignity.With my wife.For that I'm grateful."His eyes fell shut."I love..." he whispered.His chest stopped beating.Katie wept, her head still resting on him.**It** refused to watch on, impotent, any longer.Katie didn't see the tiny machines enter her husband's body.They were everywhere - omnipresent, almost - although much too small to be noticed.Katie didn't see what they did to his organs, or how they crushed the cancer that had all but eaten him.How they repaired the damage.*It* didn't even understand why it had done it - it had seen a billion of them die before, without anything close to an emotion being born of it.After all, that was nature.That was humanity, and their great flaw.No, it wasn't sure why this had happened.Exhaustion had taken Katie.She slept, not noticing her husband's chest bobbing gently up and down beneath her head.She didn't notice the hand as it softly stroked her hair, but she moaned happily as it did.When she woke, they hugged, and kissed and made a thousand promises.Then she held the cross in her hands and said a thousand *thank you's*.If it could have smiled, it thought it might have done so.

#Michael#

For the first day and night that he slept through, Michael didn't dream at all.But on the second day, the visions began: visions of gargantuan, ancient monsters, and of men and women fleeing before them; fleeing from the lightning and fire they spewed forth.Visions of the world itself cracking and opening up like a nut, and of something ancient and terrible crawling out of its core.Then, Michael saw himself as a baby, being tenderly rocked back and forth in his mother's arms -- only he couldn't see her face, there was only a stretched patch of skin over where her face should have been.His featureless father was sitting next to them."It's okay," his father cooed, without even a mouth to do so."Hush now.It's going be okay, Michael.Trust your parents."Finally, he woke.Michael's eyes were gooey and slow to open.He groaned and ran a hand down his face as he recalled fragments of his dreams.Why were his parent's faces always missing or hidden?He'd seen photos of them before, and yet his brain seemed to refuse to remember what they looked like, or any real details about them.Though the room was dark, he could just about make out the wooden planks of a ceiling swaying a little above him.It soon dawned on him that *he* in fact was the thing swaying, not the ceiling.At the same exact moment he noticed that his head was being repeatedly right-hooked by a fighter inside his brain.Or at least, it felt like it."*What the hell?*" he mumbled as he pulled the thin, cotton blanket off him and threw it onto the floor.He swung his legs over the hammock's edge and allowed himself to fall the final foot to the floor.Why was he still swaying?It was less obvious now, but he still felt his stomach lurching every few seconds.He still felt unsteady on his feet."Oh shit, oh shit," he said, running a hand through his greasy hair.He was inside a moving boat.It took him a moment to remember the events in the well; of seeing the skeleton writing at the desk.He only needed one guess to figure out which boat he was in.But where were his friends?He hoped to God he wasn't alone.*Anything but being alone.*

He unzipped his black jacket and padded his tee, finding the reassuring metal of the necklace beneath."It's okay," he told himself."Everything's fine."Michael looked around.He could see the silhouette of a table in the center of the room.There were two shapes on it, but it was too dark to make out any details.There was a hushed light coming from a crack in the wall.He walked to it and ran his hands over the rough grain.There was a circle of wood that stuck out from the rest of the wall.It was from the bottom of the circle that the light was creeping out of.Michael tried pushing the circle first, but it didn't budge.Then he pulled it; it swung back and light burst into the room through the opening, chasing the shadows away into cracks and crannies.With it came a cool breeze.Outside the window there was an endless, undulating grey.A wave sloshed at the boat and a fine misty spray skipped in through the window, wetting Michael's face.He stepped away, breathing hard, backing into the table and almost falling over it."Okay, Michael.So you're on a boat in the middle of an ocean.That's fine.Not a problem.None at all."He squeezed the metal shape under his tee with his right hand, clutching it tight until it bit into his palm.There were two doors in the rectangular room, one either end.On the table in the center of the room was a small jug, besides which was a single mug.Both items made from some kind of rough, brown clay.He leaned over the table and peered inside the jug.It was filled to the brim with a clear liquid.*Water*.He poured a little out into the mug, before picking it up and greedily gulping the liquid down.It tasted fresh and cool and so, so good.He poured again, and then again.He paused after the third drink and heard something peculiar.There was a *glugging* sound in the room.It seemed to be coming from the now half-empty jug.He cautiously leaned over and looked inside, then stared in utter disbelief.It wasn't half-empty any more.It was almost full and, as he watched, the water inside continued to rise, until it sat at the brim of the clay receptacle."You're dreaming.That's all," he told himself.But he knew he wasn't.After testing the jug a little more, and fully quenching his thirst, he decided to try the door to the right.He pulled it to and stepped out into a short hallway.In front of him was a stairwell leading up, and beyond that another closed door.He decided to take the stairs and walked very gingerly up them, aware of his dazed disposition.The stairs led up to another door, and that door led into a long room with a high, vaulted ceiling.Again there was a wooden table in the center of the room, but on this table was an odd, glass structure.It looked to Michael like a pyramid.He frowned as he walked past the monument towards the open door on the other side."Hello?"he yelled as he walked out of the hut like-structure and onto the deck of the boat.The sky above was dark and overcast, and the sea that surrounded the vessel was choppy and dull.Waves rhythmically thudded against the ship, frothing and sploshing as they broke.A brisk wind whipped Michael's hair against his neck like black laces.He'd come out onto the aft of the ship, and there was very little to see beyond the endless horizon.Michael staggered around the outside of the hut, staying as far away from the edge of the boat as he could.As soon he saw the bow of the ship he let out an audible sigh and blinked back tears.Juliet and Christopher were standing by a large wheel with knobs of dark wood sticking out of it.They were talking to each other in raised voices - arguing, maybe, but the clarity of their words were lost on the wind."Hey!"he shouted, when he was certain the tears had gone."Guys!"Juliet saw him first and her slender face burst into a wide grin."Michael!"she shouted as she ran over to him, her blonde hair trailing in the air behind her.Even Christopher allowed himself a smile as he trotted after her.Juliet paused in front of Michael for a moment and looked uneasy."Oh, what the hell," she said, suddenly leaning forward and pulling him into a tight, brief embrace.She smelled of chestnuts and flowers and salt."I'm glad you're okay," Juliet said."We weren't sure you were going to make it," Christopher chirped.Juliet cast him a disapproving glance."What happened?Where are we?And why have I got such a fricking headache?"Juliet bit her lip."What's the last thing you remember?"He thought for a moment."We went down the well... then the creature -- the skeleton -- called out to us.Is that right?Or was that a dream.I can't think clearly."He rubbed his temples."It was real," Christopher said, staring down at his shoes.Michael followed his gaze.Why did Christopher wear such wide, dorkish shoes?They looked so stupid, especially on such a small kid.Michael decided to keep the thought to himself."What happened to me?"he asked."You were *possessed*, for lack of a better word," said Christopher."The skeleton needed a body to communicate through.It, uh, it chose yours.Why did you have to step forward and start talking to it!"Juliet chided him.Michael tried to think back."I don't remember that bit.Did it... *communicate* with you?""Yes," replied Juliet."You made a very fine translator, as it turned out.Although the creature didn't really have a lot to say.""What did it want?""To warn us," said Christopher, the blood draining from his face as the memory replayed in his mind.His voice lowered to a whisper."*That Judgement day was upon us*.""Judgement day?""It said that God will soon decide the fate on mankind, and that we -- *us three* -- will be the instruments of His decision.""I don't understand," Michael replied shaking his head."Basically," Christopher began, his shoulder twitching, "we think, from what he said, God is testing us.Like he did Abraham.""Testing us?""Yeah.He's given us a task.And I think we have to succeed, or else...well, this is old testament God...The skeleton said that the storm is '*soon cast upon us*'.""Storm?"Juliet smiled reassuringly and placed a hand on Michael's shoulder."Christopher thinks we're in for the next Noah-like flood.And if we don't complete this quest, the world is going to be purged of humanity.But you know what he's like -- it's always worse case scenario in his head."Christopher glared at her.Michael looked up at the overcast sky.He tried to force a smile, refusing to look troubled in front of Juliet."Well, I've always liked water," he lied.*What would Juliet think of him if she knew he couldn't swim?*

Michael's head was full of questions.It felt like there was something else inside it too, trying to rise to the surface.But eventually a single question won out."What's the task?"---

Blackness turns to a bleary white light."Good morning, Sarah," comes a voice.It's trying to imitate a human, but it's cold and lifeless."Where... *where am I?*"

"On board the SS Pelican."The metallic voice echoes around me, as frozen clumps of memory begin to fall loose."Oh.What date is it?""It is almost January the first, 2403.""Well happy fucking new year to you, Udus," I say, as I slowly swing my legs over the ice-bed.My head pounds to a familiar, post-cryo rhythm."It is not quite New Year yet, Sarah.Please, get dressed.There is work to carry out.""Yeah," I say, as a yawn escapes my lips."I know.Ten year maintenance."As I shower and change, I think of Michael.The way, when he smiled, his freckles would shift like sand dancing in the breeze.I try *not* to think about how he died - how *any of them* died.That would drive me a little crazy-*er*.At 0900 hours, I flick the switch on the comms unit.It bursts to life, spitting out a crackle of static.No messages received."This is lieutenant Peters," I say into the microphone, aware of the monotone hopelessness in my voice."I am travelling with a cargo of one hundred and eighty embryo's towards Proxima Centauri.If anyone receives this, please reply.Over."I begin to run scans on the ship's systems.Freezers: good.Hull integrity: good.Power... 98%.*Solar cells are already decaying - and I'm not even three hundred years in.At this rate, I doubt I'll get anywhere near Proxima*."You think the other ships are doing as well as us, Udus?""No.""No?"I repeat, frowning."They have not replied, Sarah.""Yeah well," I say, as I weightlessly pirouette off a steel wall, propelling my way down an oval-shaped hallway, "maybe there's interference.""Perhaps, Sarah.""I thought you were meant to cheer me up.""You asked a question, Sarah.I answer inline with my programming."I can't help rolling my eyes as I enter into the main nav unit.I walk over to the flat, raised panel an the center of the chamber, and begin checking co-ordinates.My heart stops beating for almost a second as I see the figures on the screen."Usus... why the fuck are we so off course?"I ask, trying my best to not hyperventilate."Please wait three minutes, Sarah.""Three minutes?""Yes.In three minutes it will be New Year.""*What?*"

"I can then release additional information.""Are you serious?Did we receive a transmission?New orders?""Two minutes Sarah.Please, try to breathe normally."I inhale and exhale in a slow rhythm, fighting a rising tide of anxiety.It does nothing to help.I pinch myself, hard, letting the pain distract me."Happy New Year, Sarah," Udus says eventually, with no indication of enthusiasm in its voice."Yeah, sure.Happy New Year.Why are the coordinates fucking screwed, Udus?""Course has been altered, Sarah.""What do you mean *course has been altered*?I didn't order any changes.This has put us like... *eighteen years* behind.Why have we changed course?""I am following orders.""Okay.*What* orders?""I am sorry Sarah."My arms begin to tremble."What do you mean?Why are you sorry?""They knew eighteen months before it was due to happen, Sarah.""I don't understand... knew *what*?""That the asteroid was going to miss Earth.""**What?**"

"However, your mission had already begun.Instead of turning you around, they saw an opportunity."My waking headache returns, bringing with it a vile mix of vomit and sweat."Sarah, there had never been a better chance to field test cryonics.Not in these conditions.It takes time, to test cryonics.""... but, our mission... Earth was wiped out.""No, Sarah.Earth was not wiped out. "I slump back against the wall and cover my head with my arms."I don't understand.""I am taking you home, Sarah.The cryonics tests have proven successful and your mission is almost complete.Congratulations.""Michael," I whisper, as hope begins to well inside."What about Michael?""Sarah, it has been 334 years.Michael is dead.It will be another 305 years until we return to Earth.""...I...""Everyone you once knew is dead - nothing there has changed.However, your bravery means there is a chance for mankind's future salvation.You should be elated.""*Salvation?*"

"Out of the twenty four ships sent to field test the Astro-Cryo, we are the last remaining.You are a hero.""A hero?"I begin to laugh in my despair.A deep, cold chuckle, rising from the depths of my stomach."And what if Earth has been wiped out since we left.Who are we returning to then?""Earth has not been.""How do you know?""I have been in contact with Earth, as we travelled.""*Oh God.*"

"There are many messages for you.You may listen to them, before returning to Cryo.""Messages?""Congratulatory messages from the launch team.They are dead now, but they recorded them in advance, for this day.There are also many messages from Michael - he thought you a hero, helping to test and secure the future of mankind."A calculated pause."I am sorry, Sarah.I know you thought fondly of him.""The...embryos....?"I manage, as tears stream down my face."They are real.A different cryonics test, but equally important.""How the fuck could they do this to me?"There's no reply.I sit and weep in curled ball, slowly rotating in the zero-gravity, until there are no tears left to fall.Eventually, the metallic voice cuts through the silent void."Would you like to view the messages now, Sarah?""No... not yet.""Please say when you are ready.You might like to view them before you enter Cryo, for the journey home.""We're not going home, Udus.""I have my orders.""Fuck your orders," I say bitterly, already pushing myself against a wall and exiting the chamber."What are you doing, Sarah?""Heading to the AI housing unit.I'm going to make some changes.""Why?""So you don't try to resist *my* orders.""Sarah, that would be a mistake.""I'm not going home, Udus.That place... it's not *my* home, any more.""Sarah?""We're going to finish our mission - humanity's seeds *will* be sewn throughout the galaxy.We're taking these embryos to Proxima Centauri."

In the beginning, there was the One.In the empty, black, foreverness, she drifted, satisfied.The nothingness was perfection, and she was pleased.But as infinities passed, the One began to feel almost as empty as the void around her.She exhaled a great breath, and from it, Azill was born - *the Second*.Huge and strong, but as gentle as the One was powerful.Azill was imbued with a wondrous gift: the gift of the stars.Azill, grateful for what he had been given, set to work filling the emptiness with light and land; with ice and fire.And for a time, the One was pleased.There was such beauty in the new creations, beauty in their imperfections.And yet, she desired more.With another breath she created her second child, Memox.He bore the gift of life and set to his task with a relentless joy.To the wonders that his brother Azill had created, Memox added his gift.Soon, the rocks and islands teemed with creatures, plants and trees.There was life."You have done well, my children," said the One, and indeed she was proud.The nothingness was now *something*, ever changing, always evolving.If Azill's creations were imperfect, Memox's were truly flawed; their lives were fleeting and soon lost forever.The One did not want anything to be lost.She created her third and final child: Kualio.His gift was that of the Witness, for he could see into all of Memox's creations, and dutifully, in sacred black, tomes, he began to record all that came to pass.He was the keeper of knowledge.The One, finally content, began her Great Rest.---

Kualio was clever and fastidious; he believed in order and embraced his job, realising its great importance.He worked tirelessly, recording in his archives all the events that had been; collecting all the works that the creatures themselves created.But there was so much life, so very much to record.He dearly loved his work, but it was too great a task for he alone.And so, Kualio created machines - armies of automatons - to help him with his endless labours.As he recorded the actions of Memox's creations, Kualio himself began to see the imperfections in them.He saw the jealousy and pettyness that consumed them; the lust and anger that drove them - and it slowly seeped into him.Slowly changed him.Kaulio did not have the gift of creation that Memox had been blessed with; he could not create life, but he had far greater knowledge and cunning than either of his brothers.Knowledge, however, was not enough for him; his jealousy of Memox grew, over time, into a vile hatred.If he could not create life, he would create death.Kaulio created legions of new automatons, and for them, forged terrible weapons.He sent them to an infested rock, and watched pleased, as they cleansed it of life.The rock was perfect.Orderly.When Memox realised of Kaulio's betrayal, he wept for his tainted brother; he wept most sorrowfully however, for his fallen children.He could create life, but he could not bring it back.Azill was also saddened by his brother's actions.He appeared before Kualio, begging him to stop."I can not.Not until there is order in the chaos my brothers created," whispered Kualio, as he drove a crystal-like knife into his brother's back.Azill bled light as he fell.Memox had little time to mourn his fallen brother; he knew that he must protect his children.Memox created powerful winged guardians to fight the automatons, and sent them out into the expanse.For millennia, the guardians waged terrible battles against the machines, but slowly, surely, they drove the automatons back to their master.Finally, Memox and his guardians reached Kualio."Please brother," begged Kualio, as Memox chained him to a great chair."Spare me."Memox showed mercy to his brother, believing all life to be sacred - all life was once a part of the One, he reasoned.Out of their fallen brother's corpse, Memox created a vast prison for Kualio.A place for all his books and creations.A Forever Library, where Kualio would be cursed to stay; to continue, always, the work he had been created to carry out.---

"We're... in the body of a dead *God?*" I asked, pausing from my reading and turning to Jessica.She nodded."And the Librarian - Kualio," I whispered, "is he still...*here?*"

"I honestly don't know.I've never seen him, if that's what you mean.""But if this is- *wait!did you hear that*?," I asked, suddenly alert."Hear what?"she asked, her body stiffening.It came again.A distant rumble, like a far away drum.Then again, louder.Dust fell from the shelves around us; Jessica's face turned pale."Oh, God.It's found me," she said.She turned and ran to one of the ancient shelves."Come on, help me move some of these!"she commanded."What is it?"I asked her, as I pulled out one of the thick, black tomes.The rumble was growing ever louder."... you asked if I'd known others like you.""Yes?""I did.I've met a few like you.But... they're gone.They were taken, by these *monsters*.Then, they were *changed,* into something else.Something of order.Quick!Get in there - now!"she said, pointing to the now clear rear of the shelf."What about you?""I'll be fine.Just get in.Please!It's not after you, but if it sees you..." 

I looked at her one last time, before clambering onto the shelf and lying flat against the wall.Jessica proceeded to replace the books, hiding me behind a broken wall of black."Jessica..." I whispered."The books by the red door.Were they...?"The room began to shake fiercely, the books around me jumping with every thunderous clasp.I cautiously peaked through a thin gap between tomes, just in time to see a massive, hulking creature ducking through the archway.It looked made mostly of metal, and I could see gears rotating in its head and body."An automaton," I whispered.I wasn't sure if I was trembling now, or if it was still the room.Jessica tried to bolt past the giant robot and through to the corridor behind - but it was too quick!A metal hand snatched at her.It held her tightly against its body."The red door!"I heard her scream as the automaton carried her away.I struggled frantically to push the huge books off the shelf.By the time I was free, the corridor beyond the archway was empty.Jessica was gone.---

Or previous to the previous chapter:
##########
He'd never truly been free before today.He'd always been a servant to the great - at least, until his deeds had caught up with him and he became a prisoner of the great.Perhaps he'd always been a prisoner, he mused.He shovelled the last of the soil into the grave before patting it flat and carefully laying Alexander's crown on top of it.He sighed wistfully as he left the site.Riders from the palace would be here soon, and he didn't want to be found by them.He stumbled upon a nearby brook and with much satisfaction, washed away the crusted blood and soil from his frail body.---

The scream froze the blood inside Diazs veins; it came from the shrouded hill where the executioner had stood.By the twelve! King Diaz cursed.He was surrounded by two dozen swords, but still dread poured into him like water.If he could have peered through the darkness, he would have seen the executioners skin be ripped away from his face by razor like teeth.The King nodded at a troop of men.They drew their swords and marched hopelessly into the darkness.Continue, he instructed the man with the whip, Continue! Each lash ripped away the remaining skin from Alexander's back, but the man did not even whimper; his body was limp against the tree.The God's must be appeased! screamed Diaz.In the wet darkness above, Katie laughed as sharp steel drifted by her face.She would feel the occasional draft as a blade passed harmlessly by, but never did they get truly close.*They were so slow.*

Another plated man stumbled towards her, sword high above his head.She sidestepped the blow, and in a movement too quick for most eyes, her hand broke through his chest plating, and with a crack, his bones.She twisted his heart and he fell lifeless to the ground.His death had been quick.He had been lucky.> It is ready, my King, informed the alchemist.> And it will... asked Alexander.> I do not know.But it is the best I can do.

> Then your job is done.You are pardoned - you are a free man.Go as you please.

> I cannot leave yet, I fear.I am not innocent of blame, and I have done you wrong in my past.I will help see this through.

The screams ran through the camp like an inferno; sounds so hideous that other men dropped their swords and took flight, fancying their chances better as deserters.It is the creature, said the flag-bearer, long since deprived of his flag.He still wore his helmet and armour, but he was no more than another helpless spectator to the veiled massacre.I am trying to appease the Gods! said Diaz, his arms trembling.Why do they curse me with the creature!What does it want? 

Lightning lit up the hill, and for a single moment, the King saw pools of blood running down it.It was as if a volcano had opened and spilt its red innards.A great clasp of thunder soon followed its sister.It wants its kindred.

Diaz looked at the flag-bearer, and then at Alexander's body.Stop! he yelled at the man with the whip, but it was too late - the darkness had descended.The whip was soon tight around its master's neck, easily snapping the bone.The shroud began to drift towards Diaz.Have mercy!"cried Diaz as he stepped backwards, hands raised protectively in front of him.I only tried to please the Gods.

The Gods! Katie hissed as she approached him.Where are your Gods now?You put too much faith in them.*There is only me*.

Then.... then I will worship you, said Diaz, falling to his knees.He threw his arms to the floor.The creature laughed as it put a clawed hand around the King's neck.It picked him up and held him high above the ground.Please he begged, as his throat was squeezed and his breath failed him.Pleaa-

Katie, came the broken voice of Alexander.The flag-bearer had freed him from his binds and brought him to a state of semi-conciousness.Alexander was sat with his bloody back against the tree.The creature released its grip on Diaz and dropped the King to the ground.My love, she cried as she walked towards Alexander.She was tender as she held him, and the shroud around her became thin.They have hurt you," she said, "for that, I will punish them.

I'm sorry, Alexander managed.With great effort, he leaned forward and brought his lips to Katie's.He put his arms around her and embraced her.She kissed him back.I'm sorry, he said again, as he pulled away from her mouth.Katie sensed the flag-bearer nearing, but Alexander with the last of his strength, hugged her tightly to his body.She struggled desperately but could not break free from his grip in time.The poisoned dagger twisted into her back, and through to her black heart.The dreadful scream pierced the night itself.I'm sorry, he said again, as darkness took him.The flag-bearer removed his helmet.This is your chance to make amends, the alchemist said to the shaken Diaz.He saved you, and you will now help me save him, or no God will protect you from my wrath.

---


As he washed in the stream he thought of Alexander, and of the nights he had spent nursing him back to health.He thought of the faceless executioner that had taken Alexander's place in the grave.He wiped himself clean and sat for a while to dry.He wondered if Diaz would make as good a King as Alexander believed; if he would *truly* unite the two kingdoms - with Alexander believed dead, they were both his to rule.Diaz had at least kept his word and helped him to mend Alexander.Thank you, Alexander had said to the alchemist, as he had taken Katie's hand and boarded the vessel.He watched them as they set sail for the lands at the edge of the world.He had watched them until they were a tiny, drifting leaf, on the far edge of the horizon.Goodbye, my King, he had said, as he turned away from the shore.He hadn't been certain if the dagger hed imbued would kill the demon, or if it would kill Katie - or both.But when he twisted it into the right side of its chest, and its black heart had bled, he'd known.The alchemist didn't care for boats, although he had been tempted to accept Katie's offer to travel with them.Instead, he had accepted her second offer; that of a gentle kiss on his cheek.He'd go west, he decided.He'd always liked travelling by horse, and trading the King's sword would get him money for a good steed - and much more, besides.Perhaps he'd start a medicinal travelling shop, he considered, as he began his westward trek.He'd recently decided that he liked helping people.Somewhere in the trees above him, he heard the sound of a dove cooing.In front of him, the orange sun had begun to rise and, as it did so, it painted the distant hills in a dozen gentle hues.

Three things contributed to Elizabeth Penigree dancing down the cobbled street, through the peppery rain and silver September evening, telling all who cared to listen that she was rich; the tumour was only one of those things, and it was the one she did not know about.Of course, she felt the headaches -- how could she not?The migraines had only tiptoed in their monthly rehearsals the previous year, but now they stomped almost weekly, thundering forward toward their finale.Their curtain call.*Lonesome pains*, the orphanage owner had told her.No need for a doctor to get involved.They'd go away when she finally found a family.When a family found her.Today was that day -- and it was the second reason for her dancing down that weathered street under the paper clouds and candle sun.She'd been *found.* And the finders couldn't have been more perfect.The lady had huge, kind eyes.Not beady or grey, like of those who ran the orphanage -- but fading autumn green; welcoming, like the wavy shore of the sea calling her to come dip her feet.Not that she had seen the sea.Oh and the man!He had smiled at her.No man had ever smiled at her like that.Like they'd meant it.The scars she felt inside of her -- that she'd always felt inside of her, had been suddenly coated by something sweet.Treacle, she pondered.At the very least, by something hopeful.They could have had any of the children.But they'd chosen her.Elizabeth.There were papers to sign and dots to dot, crosses to cross.But they said they would be back tomorrow, and then she would be leaving with them.She could hardly stop her feet from fidgeting upon hearing those words, but she showed restraint for a little longer -- that's what people looked for in a child: restraint -- and she waited until they had left before moving.She scrambled to the front door after they closed it, and pressed her ear firm against the oak, waiting for the rumble of the automobile to die away as the evening wind.Then, she snuck out.She hadn't gone very far at all when she'd found the silver coin on the side of the pavement, a glimmer of light beneath a crumbling leaf.The third and final reason.A sign from God of how her life was changing -- she would tell all who would listen of her good fortune.And so the richest girl in the world danced through the peppery rain, through the satin September evening -- until the lonesome headache began, for the final time.She stumbled on the pavement, and almost fell.Why,  she wondered, as the dancers in her head began to stomp, why was it hurting still?Perhaps it wouldn't stop until she was living with her finders.She bit down on her tongue for distraction -- nothing would ruin her perfect today.She continued down the street, not noticing how cold her feet were against the cobblestone, or how numb and disobedient her limbs had become.She chose not to see the black dots that clouded her precious evening.The curtain call arrived with a cacophony of applause.A rapturous rupture.The red of a liquid rose trickled from her nose.She fell onto the street, her head bouncing like a rubber ball with a hiss of air as it slowly deflated.The coin escaped her hand as her fingers peeled open, and rolled behind her, back toward the orphanage.People crowded about her as the blood pooled.Virgin red dying dirty grey.*Are you okay, girl?* came a man's voice.*Get a doctor,* said another.*Poor lass,* cooed a woman.Poor?Couldn't they see?*I'm not poor,* Elizabeth tried to explain, *not any longer* -- but her lips only managed a crooked smile.

The lady sat at the oak table, goose-feather quill in hand.She dreamily dipped its nib into a tiny pot of midnight, and swirled the liquid within into a maelstrom of rich blues.She withdrew the nib and tapped the excess ink off on the side of the glass.It had been a long time since she had been in love.It sounded childish to think she was, now - *at her age!* - but she knew it to be true.In a hand as delicate as crystal, she told her lover about her son and how proud she was - but how she so *longed* for company; how she couldn't wait to see the man again and to-

There was a rapping on the chamber door.She reluctantly pushed her chair away from the table and rose.Hello, she called out into the empty darkness of the corridor beyond.She stepped out of her room and looked first left, then right.Nothing.There was not a soul to be seen.Puzzled, and a little perturbed, she withdrew back into her room and locked the door.*Perhaps perhaps it had not been a knock, but just a noise from outside.*

The room seemed to her much darker now, and there was a strange chill in the air.The lady became more nervous still, but she wasnt sure why.She put a shawl around her shoulders and then took out a well-worn piece of flint and its steel partner piece, from a drawer.With shaky hands and much effort, she lit three thick candles.There, she exclaimed loudly, while forcing her face into a smile.She had hoped the act might reassure her.It had not.The chamber was still unnaturally dark; it felt as if the night itself had crept in.One of the candles began to flicker, and a moment later died, leaving only a trail of soft, hazy smoke in its wake.The light of the two remaining candles departed soon after.The lady began to shiver.*Where had she put the flint?* A patch of dreadful darkness - darker still than the rest of the room - began to drift towards her.She stared into it, unable to move but desperately willing the black visage to go far, far away from her.It did not.It moved closer still.Two shimmering emeralds began to coalesce inside the shroud.---

Alexander followed the warden through the maze of sprawling, subterranean passages.The curved walls dripped incessantly, as though they were carved of ice, not rock.A cacophony of screams echoed down the tunnels - a choir of tormented souls.Alexander despised the dungeon, but he knew it to be be a necessary evil.Hes not had a visitor for a long time, the warden informed him.His voice was wheezy, a result of spending so much time in this damp purgatory, Alexander supposed.The warden held a blazing torch in one hand and it played their shadows upon the walls like a flickering marionette show.Then Im sure hell be glad of the company, Alexander replied.The warden laughed.Right!Im sure hell be extremely comforted to see - *hear* - you, the warden said, correcting himself.The tunnel spiralled deeper into the ground, the rocky enclosure punctuated occasionally only by dimly lit cells.The prisoners within them whimpered quietly as the warden passed by.They were likely afraid of the huge man, Alexander thought.The rancid smell of faeces and urine seemed to have permeated every inch of the tunnel.Eventually, the tunnel ended and they faced a thick wooden door.The warden removed a collection of keys from his belt and fumbled through them, until he found the one he was after.He turned the key in the lock and the door swung open.Wait for me here, Alexander instructed, taking the torch from the warden.He crept through the opening, pushing the door shut behind him.The man in the cell was a little more than a skeleton.He was chained to the wall, arms spread out above his head.Long tufts of white hair on the side of his head fell down and mingled indistinguishably with his beard.His eyes were closed, and Alexander wondered if he were still alive.Hello, my King, came a meek voice.As meek as it may be, Alexander was certain he detected a tang of mockery in its tone.Greetings, alchemist, Alexander replied coldly.The old mans eyes flicked open, revealing bone-white pupils.They did not look at Alexander, instead they peered straight ahead.The blind mans eyes had always unsettled the King.I have need of your services.

The alchemist's thin white lips curled into the hint of smile.The great King needs my services?And pray tell, *why would I help you?* he asked calmly.Alexander laughed.Do you like it here?

The old man smiled.I only serve the *King*.

Youve served many Kings before me! Alexander snapped, anger flooding into his veins.And now I am your King!You will serve me!

The alchemist was quiet for a while.Tell me, he asked eventually, what is it youd have me do?

Alexander began to calm.Answer my questions, for a start.What do you know of the kindred souls.

The old mans white tongue slithered out of his mouth, like a venomous snake from a cave.He licked his cracked lips.I have heard of them, as Im most certain you have.It is often told as a children's story.They are two souls that are truly one.Kindred souls are a gift from the Gods, so they say.Once the two halves find each other, they will stay together, always.

They cannot harm one another? Alexander asked keenly.The alchemist nodded.So it is said.The Gods protect their great gift.If they were to harm each other, it would be as to spit in the faces of the Gods themselves.

So if the gift wasrejected?- For just a time, I mean.

The old man bit his lip thoughtfully.I suppose that the Gods would feel it a snub, if their gift was taken ungratefully.But Ive not heard of such a thing happening, even in the stories.It would take great foolishn- 

The alchemist paused.His white eyes flicked to the King, and he began to laugh.His chains rattled as his frail body shook in unbridled mirth.Alexander left the cell, slamming the door shut as he did so.Get him down,  he snarled at the warden.Keep his hands bound behind his back.

Down? the huge man protested.With all due respect-

I have need of him.I want him *down!* *Worry not warden*, you will have him again soon.

Alexander took a deep breath.The stench of prisoners and their faecal matter filled his lungs; he gagged.He could hardly wait to be out of this stale wormhole.He would not have been so keen had he known what news waited for him above.---

I sit for a while and listen to the Devil play the exquisite, golden instrument.He has not even seen me; his eyes are closed and it seems as if he is in a trance.In his great hands the harmonica looks like a miniature, but he plays it so fast and loud, that somehow, the music it produces is more full and rich than any orchestra I've ever heard.The hairs on my arms prick up.The melody is haunting, but beautiful.It floats around the cavern, and transports me to a ship in olden times.I am alone, standing on the deck.My crew has deserted me and the vessel floats lonely, as I wait to die.The melody speeds up and the Devil picks out notes that shouldn't work together: dissonant flats and sharps; majors and minors that should never touch.I see gigantic waves form in the distance.They crash like thunder against the bow of the ship.The pale moon above is slowly engulfed by a blood-red cloud.He plays faster still; the vessel tosses and turns, and creaks and moans like it is nothing more than a twig.My heart pounds.There is something below the ship, I can *sense* it.Something, great and huge and above all, *terrible*.It is moving up.Closer to the surface -- closer to the boat.It rises!The Devil stops and opens his eyes.I don't know why, but I begin *clapping*.Applauding the Devil.Slowly first, and then faster and louder.I can't help myself."Welcome," he says with a sly smile."That was..."

"I've had eternity to practice."I nod, as if I can possibly understand."Am I dead?"I ask."You are.""And you're...Satan?"I barely dare to whisper the name, and that seems to amuse him.He laughs; a deep, rich sound."I am.""Then I'm in... What was my crime?Why do I deserve eternal damnation?"I demand.I am sure I lived an honest life."It will come back to you," he says.I shiver, and he sees it."Worry not," he snorts, "*Eternal* is not what it used to be.""What do you mean?"I ask, furrowing my brows."God has... changed the rules.No one need stay here now.There is forgiveness for all his *children*."He spreads his arms wide and I look around the empty cavern."Even you," he says as his lips curl up into a demon's smile."I can still go to heaven?"My eyes are open wide."You can," he says as he reaches for his harmonica once more."Only **I** must stay.Now, leave me.Go play with your old friends.I have no interest in delaying you."He points me towards a hollow in the cavern's wall.He closes his eyes and begins playing that beautiful music once more.The bitter-sweet sound takes me away again.This time I am in a car.*My* car.I've been drinking, celebrating a performance.I didn't see her in the darkness.No.It *wasn't* dark.There is a thud.A scream.I don't stop.The terrible memory returns.I killed her.I killed the lady as she pushed her pram.Then, a single month later I killed myself.I collapse onto the rock floor and weep as the haunting music wraps itself around me like a child's blanket.It comforts me.When, eventually he stops and sees me still sitting there, he looks almost... surprised."Why?"he asks simply."I killed them.I don't deserve heaven.""It matters not if you deserve it.""It matters to me."There is silence for a while.Two fallen angels together in their loneliness."Teach me to play," I ask."..."

"I want to play like you.I want to bare my soul through music.I *need* to.""It would take an eternity to play like me," he says."I have eternity at my disposal."The Devil smiles.---

 "The mash is nice today."I don't mean to say it but it still trickles out, as if my mouth is a leaking toilet.What I mean to say, is that I love every groove that time has chiseled into your skin.You're a wrinkled Rushmore; a lopsided carving pitting nature's cold beauty against humanity's most warm and wondrous.Your face used to be smooth, when we met.A lifetime ago.If I placed my hands on your cheeks and pressed your skin back, I wonder if I would again see that girl with eyes the colour of Spring?It doesn't matter.I don't want her.I love you how you look now.How you've looked *every* now.You're a perfect picture.You always have been."Gravy's a tad weak though."I'm sorry I'm so inane.Was I ever a good dinner companion?Did I ever tell you, that on our first date -- it was here, you know -- I arrived two hours early?I felt so lucky, so excited, that you'd agreed to dine with me (me!), that I tried to stretch the day out like an elastic band.You arrived perfectly on time, as always.I feel like a piece of stretched elastic now."The mash is nice today."Have I already said that?I don't know.I'm sorry.You know I love you.I hope you always knew, but God I wish I'd told you more often.A hundred times a day at least, that's what you deserved.*I love you.*

I hear them, you know.They watch surreptitiously, and whisper like spies in the shadows of the kitchen door.Why does he still come each weekend, long after you're gone?I know it's what they say, without even hearing the precise words.Why does he set up a silver frame, holding a faded picture of a silver haired woman, on the other side of the table?He must be mad.I can't tell them why, because I think saying out loud might make it real.But if I could, if I was brave enough, I would say: because sometimes, for maybe half a precious second, I might trick my brain into thinking you're still alive, and in doing so I give myself a reason to keep going.A reminder of *why*.Not everyone gets a *why*.I'm so very lucky."No lumps at all.Very good mash this week."

"No way am I going down there first," said Christopher, raising his hands."Uh-uh.""Fine," huffed Juliet."Seeing as Christopher is so afraid of spiders and worms, I'll go first.""I'm not afraid of spiders!"Christopher objected, his voice cracking in the process."Oh, it's the worms then?"Juliet replied as she sauntered toward the hole in the ground where the tree had not so long ago been.Michael stepped in front of Juliet and puffed out his chest."Maybe a man should go down first, Jules.You know, in case there's anything bad down there."He gave her a wink.Juliet rolled her eyes."In that case, let me know if you see *a man* around," she retorted, as she stepped past him."As it is, I'm going first.Wait until I get to the bottom and give you the go ahead before following."Christopher patted his pocket until he found his bag of raisins.He took them out and began munching nervously.He watched as Juliet took hold of the rope they'd set up, and began shimmying down.The two boys at the top of the pit waited in silence as the girl was swallowed by the mouth of the pit.Michael got out a packet of cigarettes from his jacket pocket and lit up, puffing away nonchalantly.Christopher hopped between feet, anxiety growing like a balloon.*Was she okay?Had she fallen?*

"Juliet!"Christopher shouted eventually, unable to take the silence any longer.He put his hands around his mouth and yelled again."Juliet!Are you okay?""Shut up, dipshit," Michael said, casting him a dismissive glance."You can still *see* her, if you get a bit closer to the pit's edge.I thought with all your book learning you'd know that.""Yeah... of course.I know I *could*.""Go on then.Get closer and see for yourself.""I'm okay right here, thank you very much," replied Christopher, shovelling in another handful of raisins whilst rocking back and forth on his heels."Oh, God.You're afraid of heights too?""No!I'm not afraid of anything.I just-- you know what, fine," Christopher replied, creeping very cautiously towards the edge of the hole.He peered down into the blackness."I don't see her," he said."That's 'cause you're so damn short.You'd need to get a lot closer to the edge.But take it from me, someone who *is* tall enough to be allowed on rides at the fair, she's doing just fine.""I'm allowed on the rides!""Teacups don't count."Christopher took a deep breath, then edged even closer to the mouth of the hole, hoping to spot Juliet's blue cardigan swaying somewhere in the dark below.But the rain from the storm had left the ground slick and crumbling; Christopher's foot slipped forward and he lost his balance.His arms flailed wildly, locking onto the only thing they could find before he fell: Michael's woolly jumper.It wasn't enough.For a few seconds, the world became a dizzying blur of light and dark.Then, only dark.---


"Christopher?"said the darkness in a gentle voice."Are you okay?Talk to me, Christopher.""My- my raisins.""I'm going to kill him!"yelled a different voice."He does this to us, and only thinks of his raisins?I swear, I'll kill him!"The first voice hissed at the second."He's dazed, you idiot.""That's his own fault for being so clumsy.The bastard dragged me down with him!""Yes, I know.You've told me a dozen times already."Sense began to trickle back into Christopher's head."Where- where are we, guys?""It's okay, Christopher.Don't be alarmed," cooed Juliet."What's going on?""Do you remember the hole in Wycombe forest we found?"Juliet asked."Where the old oak had been?"Christopher thought for a moment.Yeah.He remembered.They'd been out exploring, seeing what damage Storm Teresa had done.Then they'd found the body of the great tree, lying like a corpse on the floor of the forest.And where it had been... an endless, black pit.They'd taken the rope from the swing by the creek.Juliet had gone down first... then he'd crept near to the edge to look for Juliet and-- *Oh shit!* No wonder the second voice had been so angry."Sorry, Michael," Christopher murmured."Sorry?You could have killed me, you dipshit!You might *still* have killed me!""What do you mean?"he replied."You kinda..." Juliet began, "you kinda knocked me off the rope when you fell.So we *all* fell to the bottom of the pit, and well it turns out the pit was deeper than our rope was long.""Oh..."

"Yes '*oh*', dipshit," said Michael."We're trapped down here until someone realises we went missing.""I'm sorry, guys.""Do you think you can get up?"Juliet asked."I- I don't know.My back hurts," Christopher replied."Good.Lie down on the floor with all the spiders," Michael taunted."I can feel them crawling over my feet right now.I think they're heading to you.""L-liar.""... and do you hear that?Boy, do they sound hungry today!I can hear the clattering of their teeth."Christopher swallowed hard, rolled over, and got himself up onto his knees.Juliet put an arm around him and helped him the rest of the way to his feet."So what now?"Christopher asked, brushing himself down."Anyone have their phone?""Yeah, that's the thing," said Juliet."Mine broke on the way down.Yours is locked, and we don't know what pattern you use.""Wouldn't matter if we did," huffed Michael."You've got no reception."Juliet passed the phone over to Christopher."Can you put on your flash-light?Then I'll take a look at your injuries.""What about mine, Jules?"asked Michael."I think I'm hurting pretty bad at the top of my legs.It's throbbing."Michael gasped as Juliet's shoe hit him in the groin."Thanks," he wheezed, his face reddening."Much better."A white light lit up the a small cave like area as Michael's flash-light burst into life.Crumbling earth, rocks and dangling roots surrounded them.There wasn't much space; it was only a little larger than a well."What is this place?"Juliet asked."Guess it's uh... a natural Earth hole," Michael replied, his voice a tad higher than normal."A what?"Juliet asked frowning."You're making that up.""Guys," gasped Christopher."A natural Earth hole.Like... *rain* and stuff make them.I learned about it in school.""Well I know that's a lie then.The only natural hole here is in your head"

"Guys!"Christopher repeated."Look!"They turned to see what Christopher was pointing out.He'd moved a bunch of hanging roots to the side and pointed his flash-light to the space between.There was something there.Something wooden."What the hell is that?"said Juliet, pulling at the remaining roots.Michael joined in, moving dirt and rocks away until they were left with only an  arched, wooden door.They looked at each other, then back at the door.There was writing engraved on it."Puteus?"Michael said, reading out one of the words."Is that Spanish or something?""Latin," said Christopher, running his hand over the text."It's all Latin.""That's a dead language, right?"said Michael."Do you know what it means, Christopher?"asked Juliet, coming in close to Christopher and pressing her own hand against the engravings.Their fingers touched for a moment; Michael huffed behind them."Puteus means: '*well*'.""Like, health?""No, like we might currently be down a well.You know, where you get water from.""Oh!"said Juliet."So this is an ancient well.But why is there Latin text on a wooden door at the bottom of an ancient well in Missouri?""What's the other word on it?"Michael asked, still staring at the door."Ani...

"Animarum," Christopher finished."It means '*souls*'.""Soul well?"Michael asked, his brows creased.There was a sudden *thump* against the door; the three of them jumped back as a rain of fine dirt poured down over them."What was-" Christopher asked, only to be interrupted by another thump.It came came again.And again.Rhythmic now, like someone knocking."Not '*soul well*'," Juliet whispered.*Thump.*

"The Well of Souls."*Thump.*

I watched, paralysed, as the automatons continued harvesting a dead God.The God that had created them.A child of the One.Had *they* fought and killed Kualio - was that why there were so many ruined automatons?And if so, why had they?I should have seen it as it approached me from the side, but it was different to the others - quieter.It was almost as if it had sneaked up on me.I didn't see anything until the metal arm was coming down.And then... darkness.---

The floor I was lying on was cold and my eyes were blurry; I struggled to open them.My head was pounding and I felt like something inside was trying to punch its way out.A booming sound began cascading down around me.The noise slowly began to make sense - it was someone talking."...worthless to me as it is.Its skin is unfit for my body.It shall be another tome to remember me by.Take it below.Take its story, then end it."The voice was cold and emotionless, and so, so loud.I tried to focus my vision, but everything was a haze of lights and dots."Oh great God," replied a quieter voice, "the creature followed the girl.It knows her."My vision began to clear a little.There were two figures, standing next to some kind of immense building.They were both automatons.One was a smaller type with four legs and two arms; I was sure it had been the one that attacked me.The second was the same type as that that had taken Jessica, and those that had been mining the librarian."You dare question me?"came the voice again, but this time there was a hint of emotion in it.A rumble of displeasure.The building behind the two automatons began to swim into focus, and I saw it for what it was.A huge, hideous automaton.It was covered in patches of yellowed skin, that were sewn onto bits of bone and metal.Below certain patches, I could see massive gears rotating, making the skin pulse and crawl.I saw legions of automatons swarming over it, working on skin graphs and inserting bone into, and around, its metal platings."I am sorry, God," said the automaton.As I watched, a massive truck like arm came down from the monstrous automaton; the robot that had spoken back splintered into a thousand pieces."Go," *God* commanded the four legged automaton; it quickly scuttled over to me.On seeing my eyes open, it raised an arm and brought it down on me.---

"Come back," a voice whispered in my ear.It was gentle and soothing.Something pushed at my shoulders.I tried to open my eyes, but the haze was back.The thumping in my head was worse than before."Go away," I managed to mumble."Michael, you've got to come back."I felt light fingers running through my hair."Jess?""Jessica.I never said you could call me Jess.""Jessica!"I said, and a grin spread over my face.The fog cleared slightly, and I saw her face, albeit twice, smiling at me."Welcome back."She leaned down and hugged me.I mustered as much strength as I could, and hugged her back."I was having a dream... that I was back home with my family.Oh!"I exclaimed, suddenly remembering everything that I'd seen, "the librarian - he, *it*, it's *dead*."She only nodded.It wasn't the reaction I'd been expecting."I know," she said quietly."Oh.That's not all, though - the automatons have created their own God-thing!"She nodded again.My headache began to lessen slightly and I pushed myself up.Looking around, I could see we were in a type of cell.A small walled room with a locked metal door.There were at least a dozen piles of clothes scattered around the confines."What is it, Jessica?What's the creature?Why'd they kill the librarian?"Jessica let out a deep breath."Do you remember the book you read?"I nodded."The first automatons were created to help Kualio with his task.They were built to order the library, essentially.""I remember.""Well, there aren't many of *them* left, and those that remain do not function as well as they used to, I suspect.""But I saw thousands of them.Maybe more!""No, all the ones you've seen are the second automatons.Those built to help Kualio with his later task - extinguishing life and brining true order."I was quiet for a while as I thought this over."So... they killed Kualio because..."

"They deemed him *alive*, I think.I think a lot of the old automatons were destroyed trying to protect him, too.""This is... a *lot* to take in, Jessica - and how do you know all this?"She didn't reply."What about the creature I saw, the giant automaton God thing?""I don't know exactly what it is.It's not a God, I'm certain of that.Maybe the automatons created it to help them with their task.Maybe it was a normal automaton that went haywire.All I know is that it's their leader, and we've got to stop it."---

Hope you guys are enjoying this.I'm going away tomorrow, so I've added an extra part today.I will try hard to get another posted tomorrow, it just depends what kind of access I have to a computer/wifi.Thank you all for reading!https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/69qlqu/the_dream_library_part_8/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=nickofnight

It had taken me a long time to get back to the terrible bookshelf that hid the red door.I prayed that it hadn't been too long, but immediately castigated myself for doing so.*Who*, exactly, did my prayers go to?Navigating the Corridor of the Old Gods without Jessica had resulted in a number of wrong turns, and my progress had been slow.The Sorting Room had been only a little better.As Jessica had said it would, the sixth conveyor belt held the leather tomes bound for my destination.But compared to the speed that the Great Hands had carried the black tomes, the journey on the conveyor belt had been incredibly slow and frustrating.I wondered all the while, if my friend were still alive.Butterflies in my stomach slowly grew into poisonous snakes, that crawled and bit and and left me trembling.But eventually, I'd arrived.And now the bookshelf, with those accursed tomes, waited in front of me.The books I had earlier thrown onto the floor, had been replaced onto the shelf.Or at least, something had *tried* to replace them.Some were upside down, others had their spine against the wall.*Their spine...*  Everything about this shelf repulsed me, and I dreaded to think what might be behind the red door.But I had to look, because Jessica might be there.I hadn't even known her long; why was I so desperate to help her, I wondered.Perhaps it was because she'd protected me from the automaton.But I think... it was something else.There was *something* about her.I was about to start removing them, so as to get to the door hidden behind, when I noticed a new book had been added.It stood out from the others as it had a kind of shiny gloss to it, that no other had.With trembling hands, and tears welling in my eyes, I retracted the volume from the shelf.> Christian

I couldn't stop the tears that fell from my relief, but I hated myself for them.Someone else had died, but Jessica - she might still be alive.I pulled book after book away from the shelf, slowly uncovering the rusty red behind.Soon I had cleared enough room to wriggle onto the shelf.I touched the door's cold handle for the second time, but this time there was no voice preventing me from doing something foolish.This time, I turned it and pushed the door open.White light blasted out of the opening, momentarily stunning me.I raised a protective hand over my eyes and crawled through.---

I had come out onto a broken, marble floor - or at least, it looked like marble; huge slabs of whites and creams were interspersed with rich veins of grey.But the floor was cracked and chipped, and in places, entire slabs had been broken up into shards.The light was dim and the air was stale.I was in a sort of grand hallway, and in front of me was there was a wide, winding staircase, twisting its way upwards.The bannister that ran along it was mostly missing, and the steps themselves were badly dented.A matted white rug flowed down the stairway.Two corridors ran left and right of my position, and to the side of the great staircase, a second, smaller stairwell led downwards into a greater darkness.But the sight that made my blood run cold, was that of the chains.Dozens of huge crystal-like chains tumbled down the main stairwell, some getting lost for a while within the white rug, and then leaping out again further down.The chains split up at the bottom, continuing on through both corridors, until I could no longer see them.I thought of the book I'd read; of what had happened to the librarian.The thought of leaving - of turning back - forced its way into my head.But the spark of that cowardly idea was extinguished as soon as I glanced behind me to see nothing but wall.The door was gone.I heard a distant thumping noise coming from somewhere down the left corridor.Its echo ran through the great hall, quickly growing louder.*An automaton!* 

I needed somewhere to hide.I sprinted over to the larger stairwell, pulled myself up onto the great first step, and dived under the thick rug.A few second later, the automaton was in the hallway.It paused just beneath me.I held by breath for what seemed like minutes, but was perhaps only seconds.Then, it walked away towards the second stairwell, and descended into darkness.The thunder of its steps gradually drifted away to nothingness.I breathed heavily, catching my breath and hugely relieved to have avoided the mechanical beast.As I exhaled, my breath caused a single long strand on the rug to drift forward.There was something *odd* about it, something familiar.I grabbed at the strand.It was rather wiry and bristly- 

I quickly dropped it and jumped the side of the *rug*.The shaggy, white rug wasn't a rug at all.It was a huge beard, cascading down from somewhere high above.Had its owner felt me on it?*Had I disturbed a God?*

For a while I stood perfectly still.But curiosity was eating at me; I *had* to know for sure what was up there.I had to see for myself.Perhaps Jessica was up there, prisoner to the librarian, desperately awaiting my help.---

I was careful to avoid both the chains and the beard, as I slowly pulled my way up the gargantuan steps.For hours I ascended.I might have given up and turned back, if not for a dim light far above that was slowly growing in intensity as I climbed.The stairwell eventually ended, and in front of me was a massive, wooden door.The beard was both thicker and higher here; easily twice my height.Both it, and the chains, crept through a small opening in the door.I had no choice but to traverse the beard; it was unavoidable - the mass of hair blocked the entire opening.I was as gentle as possible as I crept through it, feeling somewhat like an explorer in a jungle thicket.When eventually the bristles ended, and I came out into the room on the other side, my mouth fell.Scattered around the great chamber were thousands upon thousands of broken automatons.Gears and metal platings were strewn over almost every space on the floor.It was as if they had waged a great war in here.There was something else too; something more worrying than even the ruined automatons.A great skeleton sat slumped over a desk.Its grey hair and white beard flowed from it like a waterfall from a rock.Crystal-chains ran around it, binding its white bones firmly to the chair.Functioning automatons crawled over the remains like ants, carving into it with saw-like tools.Mining bone.The misplaced books and the lack of order I'd seen; the run down area Jessica had taken me to.I understood why it was happening.The librarian was dead.---

"I'm sorry," Alexander said, as his spade bit into the earth.Tears crept down skin that had, until this day, been desert."Why are you doing this?"Katie asked, her wrists struggling against the rope bindings; they didn't hurt her, no matter how fiercely she fought them, and yet they were tight.Alexander heaved another mound of dirt out of the slowly deepening hole.In the distance, a great vulture flew down from a tree and landed next to the body of Katie's brother.Its beak dipped into the open carcass."I couldn't kill you.I can't even harm you.""Then...we are..."

Alexander paused for a moment."I-" he stuttered, "I can't kill you, but others can.*They will*.You are the King's daughter.You will be cut into pieces.And I will be killed for helping you."He thrust the spade back into the earth.The vulture squawked; its beak was now a dripping crimson."You don't have to do this.We could run away, together," Katie begged."I'm sorry.But I will come back for you."Sweat mingled with tears, and the evening light danced on his cheeks.He picked Katie up, and carefully placed her into the pit."Please," she begged, terrified, as dirt fell onto her.For a moment he paused.The spade trembled violently in his hands.He looked down into Katie's eyes: they were a damp, viridescent - like morning dew on a rose leaf.After a deep breath, he shook his head."Plea.." Her voice was muffled and faint, and soon Alexander heard nothing."I'll come back for you.I promise."---

Darkness.Moons passed.Years fell like raindrops and the black net seemed to last forever.It was a farmer, turning earth for his crops, that found the body.When it began to slowly move, writhing in its pit, he dropped his spade and fled.Katie crawled out of the grave, shielding her face from the blazing sunlight.Her once green eyes were now that of the darkness she'd been prisoner to.She'd never felt so thirsty - a dreadful, desperate burn that had been building for so long yearned within her.Her torn, rotten, clothes flapped in the wind.She had waited for him - she'd had no choice.Her body had not suffered in the grave, but her mind had been terribly changed."I will find you, Alexander," she whispered.The breeze took her words and spread them like seeds across the kingdom.Far away from the excavated pit, a shiver ran down the new King's spine.---

"I love you sweetheart," Sally whispered into her son's ear.She pulled the blanket up to his to chin and kissed him softly on the forehead.It was a warm kiss."I don't want you to go mom," replied Thomas as he stifled a tiny yawn."The monsters come out when you're not here.Please stay.They're afraid of you.Pleassssse.""It's just for two weeks, honey."Sally replied, blinking back her tears.Work called, and she had to answer.It was for her son, after all.She *had* to go.For the millionth time she wished Christopher was still alive."I don't like uncle James."the boy protested quietly."I've got you an early Christmas present," Sally said, leaning over the bed to pull out a large rust coloured bear from a plastic bag.It was soft to touch and its short hair was very ruffled.It wore a red bow tie."This is Frederick," she said passing it to Thomas."He has no home and he needs looking after.I told him you'd take care of him until I got back."Thomas' eyes lit up and his sadness was forgotten as quickly as a dream upon waking."Can you be brave for him?""Yes," whispered an almost breathless Thomas, hugging his new friend tightly."Yes.I'll look after you always."The boy smiled at the bear.The bear smiled at the boy.The bear made a promise of its own.---

Three nights after Sally left, the monster came to visit Thomas.He knew it would sooner or later -- it always came when mom was away -- but that didn't make it any better.A vile stench of alcohol and tobacco reached his nose long before his bedroom door crept open.The monsters' skin was slimy to his touch, and when his little red lamp came on he could see just how pale and vile the creature looked.It was wretched.It smiled at him.Blood red lips, teeth stained dark with wine.It sat down on the bed next to him.The creature's smell made Thomas' stomach turn."Please, don't," Thomas whimpered.He knew it wouldn't listen -- it never did.He hugged Frederick tightly, determined not to let the monster hurt his best friend.He'd promised his mom.He'd promised Frederick."Shh," crooned the monster."It'll be okay."It smiled again.A liars smile.It began stroking Thomas's hair.The little lamp suddenly began to flicker, and then *nothing*.Just darkness."God fucking damn it," screamed the monster.It got off the bed, intent on turning on the main light.Then there was a growl.Then there was a scream.Next there was silence.Finally there was a soft, reassuring voice as Frederick snuggled back down into Thomas' arms."Goodnight, Thomas."

Joe wrapped an arm around his wife's shoulders and pulled her tightly to his chest.Most of the residents of St Bartholomew's Street had already come out of their houses to see the cause of the midnight fracas.They were now gathered around the drive of number thirty-eight, as if patrons around a theatre stage, many of whom were hoping for a particularly blood thirsty production.Others, like Joe, were simply stuck in a state of disbelief.Of *refusing* to believe.Sarah looked up at her husband."They can't be, can they?We've known them for so long."Joe felt her hand curl up into a ball against his back."They looked after the children only last week.Jesus Joe, we *trusted* them."The Enforcers' Jeep waited empty but eager, outside their neighbour's drive.A harsh light spiralled out from the vehicle, painting the gathered crowd first in broad red brushstrokes, then blue.Their neighbours' door lay splintered on the brick driveway.Joe shook his head."We- we don't know that they *are*, yet, sweetheart.Not until the Enforcers bring them out.Until then, I think they both deserve the benefit of the doubt.They've earned at least that much from us.""Amanda and Tony," his wife continued unperturbed, "they just seemed so *normal*.Just like us.I suppose that was the point - it was all a... a *trick*.To get close to us, so that they could eventually..." Her arms began to tremble.Joe took her hands in his own and held them tightly.He opened his mouth meaning to reassure her, when the Special Office Enforcers came striding out of the broken doorway."Oh God," cried Sarah as she watched her neighbours be dragged out of their house, towards the Jeep, their arms handcuffed behind their backs."How- how could you!"she screamed at them."How sick are you freaks?We trusted you with our children!"Amanda must have heard her, as she glanced up at Sarah.In that moment, Joe saw his neighbour's battered face and the blood dribbling from her nose."Go back to your own planet!"Sarah spat."And take the rest of your kind with you!You're not welcome!""Honey," said Joe, blinking back tears."Please.You don't mean that.They're our friends.""*Friends?* They're sick freaks, that's what they are!You've read the reports.The things they've done..."

"You can't believe all that?Amanda and Tony have always been good t-"

A yell from nearby interrupted him."Show us their eyes!""Yeah, their eyes!""We want proof!"The Enforcer who held Amanda, pulled her up to her feet.He took out a plastic device, that looked a little like a gun, from his jacket pocket.With one hand, he grabbed Amanda's hair and yanked her head back; with the other, he fired a wide, green beam into her face.Her eyes lit up a bloody, unnatural, red.There were screams and panicked gasps from the crowd."I God-damned knew it!"said one resident."They've always been perfect.*Too* perfect!""Hang 'em!"said another.Tony, who was kneeling on the floor, pushed himself up and thrust himself head first at the Enforcer holding his wife.The Enforcer stumbled, almost falling, but at the last moment just regained her balance.Another Enforcer ran at Tony and threw his fist into the man's throat.The first Enforcer rejoined the fray, stamping her boot into the fallen man's head.Joe began to tremble."No..."

"Honey?"said Sarah."This isn't right," said Joe defiantly."It isn't right!""Tell that to the children," said Sarah."This is *exactly* right.It's what they deserve."A haze of red flashed from the Jeep as its light spun again; Joe saw his hands as the light spilled over them.A moment later, a blue light replaced the red, washing it away.Only, the red wasn't gone.It would never go away, unless...

"I'm sorry," he whispered, kissing his wife's hair."They may not be from here, but they're sure as hell human.And more than that, they're our friends."Sarah screamed, pleading him not to, but he was already in mid sprint.His shoulder landed with a thud against against one of the Enforcers.A right hook took the other off her feet."It's okay," said Joe, offering a hand to the beaten, bloodied man.Tony looked up through his one, non swollen eye."Thank you," he croaked."Are you one of..." 

But the question was never finished.More officers had arrived.A gun shot.A bullet tore through Tony's head.A long streak of red spattered the street.Amanda's blood curdling scream cut through the noise of the frenzied crowd, until the hilt of a gun struck her head and silenced her.Joe stepped back in sick disbelief."No..." he muttered."Oh God, no."And then, they were on him.Fists and boots battering him down until he became numb and still.When finally satisfied, the Enforcers dragged Joe back to his feet."Show us his eyes!"came a shout from the crowd."He's one of them for sure!""Show us his eyes!"A hand yanked back Joe's head.A fierce green light pierced his retinas.If he could have screamed, he would have done."He's not one of them," said a woman who lived two doors down from Joe.The blood-lusting crowd seemed to deflate slightly, shoulders slumping and heads turning."Just loves him some Second-Worlds.""That's bad enough, ain't it?!"Joe saw his wife standing on the doorstep, watching him with tear streaked eyes.Jane and Thea had come to the door and Sarah had her arms wrapped around them, trying to comfort them.The green light was ripped away from his eyes.As it twisted direction, for a split second, it touched his wife's face.His entire body began to tremble.No one else saw: they were all too busy baying like wolves at Joe.He didn't mean to struggle again - it was instinctive - but it was all it took.Joe looked a last time at his his family, as a second gun fired.Sarah had tried to cover her children's eyes, but Thea saw it all through a gap between her mother's fingers.She saw the blood spurt out of her father's chest and his body fall limply to the ground.She saw the inhumanity and unfairness, and felt all the weight of her species press down upon her shoulders.Her eyes, if for only a second, burned a brighter red than any before.Thea squeezed a hand into a ball and made herself a promise.

Most days, I am chained high above the fat King's throne, rocking gently just above him.A blanket is tied around me to make my appearance more... acceptable.My pale, vascular skin is off putting to Frederick whilst he is eating - which is almost always.He'd rather I am neither seen nor heard.My tongue, nails and teeth were removed soon after my first disastrous attempt to escape.I hear King Frederick somewhere below me.I hear his huge jaw chewing meats loudly, and I hear excess food spill out of his maw and onto the marble floor beneath him.Eventually he finishes his feast, and soon after, I hear him snoring loudly.He is still young.How long will I be left to endure this pain?---

I had a human mate, once.I loved her more dearly than I have loved anything before or since.Her eyes were the color of starlight, and when she spoke, her voice wrapped around me like the softest blanket.I was entranced by her.We lived together through the reign of a dozen Kings and Queens, content in each others company.Happy just to be.Love kept us both alive, but my Clara did not age like I did."I am old," Clara said, the day she died."My skin can no longer crease, for it has folded all it can.My hair has long since left, and I hear only when you slowly shout.I struggle each morning just to stay awake till noon, and I am in such pain that I cry even as I sleep.I have suffered it this long, only for you, my love.""Clara, please..." was all I could manage in a whispered, wasted response."I am not like you.My skin is neither soft nor pale, and my heart no longer beats so strong.I love you, Felipe, but I am ready to go.You have given me many great joys.Give me now one last gift , I beg of you: grant me *death*.""Clara," I had replied, as a tear trickled down my cheek and splashed onto the wooden floor.I pulled her wrinkled hand up to my mouth, and I kissed it gently, before walking the twenty long steps out of our home, and down a small pebbled path.I knew by the time I reached the end, Clara was dead.When I was young, I was told never to fall in love with a mortal.It had taken me until that moment to understand why.I never returned to that house.I never fell in love again.Instead, I wandered the world and lived in isolation, until the day I heard the distant cries for help.A King was dying.Perhaps he was a great king, I reasoned.A king that did much for his people.I had to help.I was a fool.---

They have all left the throne room, and below me the King is in a deep sleep."Grandpa?"says a small child somewhere below.I recognise the voice of the young prince - he must have snuck in without the guards noticing.The King continues snoring."Grandpa, will you play?Please!I have no one else to practice my sword play with."The voice is near now.He is by the King!He has passed the crossing line.I summon all my strength, and begin to rock back and forth above the obese creature below.Back and forth, as my chains sing a song of rust.I am closer to the child than I am the King - and for a wondrous second I hear the sound of choking emanating from Frederick!The next second, the chains' momentum have pulled me back - I am again nearer to the King than the prince."Grandpa!"yells the concerned prince."Get back!"the King yells hoarsely at his grandson."BACK!""I'm- I'm sorry grandpa," says the tearful child, and I hear the tapping of tiny footfall as he runs towards a door.The King tears the blanket off me, and for a moment, the light blinds me.Slowly, I begin to make out that fat, grinning face that has become so familiar."Almost," he says.He looks almost purple and sweat is profusely dripping off of him."Almost got me this time, Felipe."He laughs and throws the blanket back over me.I will make him pay for what he has done.I will kill him.One day.

I'm the grave-digger for secrets.I bore pits so deep and dark that no light'll ever again touch the whispers thrown into 'em.My own secret, that was the first I buried.The one that got me into this line of work.Now they all come to me 'cause they can't destroy their secrets, neither.Someone will need to know someday, just today ain't that day, they tell me.Can't afford America to come crashing down right now, not with all the global instability.Or maybe they shove the secret into my hands and tell me that a record of this sin or that sin needs to be kept for judgement day - *you must understand?* Or perhaps they say: well I'm a man of morals, after all, and the truth can't just be burned -- it needs to be kept forever, even if never known.My reputation is built on my ability to keep things quiet.And should just one of these secrets ever slip out, then I'll be digging a final grave and jumping headfirst into it.But as things stand right now, the game of cards I'm dealing is just about even.Each player understands I can see all the hands, and if something happens to me, then I tell all the other players what they were holdin'.That's why they trust me: because they *don't* trust me.It was a Friday when I met her, and a Saturday when she died.The bar leaked smoke, bad jazz, and the stink of urine like it was an overflowing sewage plant.But I was used to seedy.They never liked to give me their secrets anywhere but seedy.Dirty places for dirty business.Except, *she* wasn't seedy.She was class.The type of dangerous class that meant if you weren't carrying a gun in your pocket before meeting her, you damn sure were after.I was sipping my second third-rate whiskey and watching the band pluck strings like they were defeathering a chicken for the kitchens, when her scent stabbed me.Sweet, sure, but there was something more seductive just beneath the surface.I turned to see her sit on the stool next to me, the slit in her red dress rising just enough to show her pale thighs as she crossed her legs.Bet there ain't never been a stool that happy before.The barman must have seen her even before I did, as a moment later a drink in a glass almost as long as her dress, slid in front of her.He didn't wait around for payment.She must have caught me staring as her plump lips smiled.Then, her voice like silk pantyhose, she said, "Are you Mister Secret?"The lines on my face creased, as if maybe I was smiling too."I ain't never been called that before.""But you are?"If it was a smile, it turned into a tight frown."Maybe.You the one who wants to make a deposit?""Yes."She the reads the hand I'm holding."What's the matter?Didn't expect a woman?""Didn't expect much, to be on the level with you.Never do.And I'm rarely disappointed.""Are you disappointed, today?"My skin tugged even tighter as I grinned."Oh, hugely."She placed her handbag down on the bar next to her drink."The money is in there.As is my secret.Can I trust you completely, no matter how terrible the secret I hold is?""Lady, I never look at them.That's not my business.I just bury them.""They'll bury me," she said, eyes falling to the ground."Soon.""Oh yeah?"A long smooth inhale."Yes.""And who are *they* exactly?""I thought you didn't look at the secrets.""That's a secret too?"She paused, then shrugged."I suppose not.The CIA.MI6.KGB.Every intelligence agency in the world, Mister Secret.""John.You can call me John.""Why?That's about as much your real name as Mister Secret.And has less of a ring to it."She had a point."Must be something pretty big you're burying.""It would change *everything*."Her lipstick-painted lips moved into slow ovals on the last word, and I swear I ain't never seen syllables look quite that sexy before or since."Well, it's safe with me," I assure her."Once I bury it, I don't dig it back up for no one.I got more dirt on those agencies than there is dust on the moon."She pushed the handbag to me."I could tell you were the man for me."I wanted to tell her that I'm pleased to hear it but that her ruby handbag wouldn't suit me.But she looked like puppy that had just lost it's Ma, so I laid off the charm."I'll be dead tomorrow."She said it nonchalant, with a wave of her hand and a twist of her wrist, and I wasn't sure if I was meant to laugh."Oh yeah?Well, you better enjoy tonight then."She raised her glass and nodded."To tonight."I raised mine."Tonight."I don't remember much of the evening from there.A blur of red dress and drink and skin and sweat.The scent of tobacco and sex.The vague taste of a good night.But I do remember, with vivid clarity, the phone-call I got the next afternoon, the night after I left the Lady in Red's apartment, all her secrets swaying in a small red bag on my shoulder."Dead?"I repeated, voice and stomach hollow."And you were last to see her," the officer informs me."Yeah, sure, but..."

"Don't go anywhere.We need to bring you in for a few questions.I'll send the boys around to pick you up.""That would be a mistake, on your part."The threat is clear.He must know who I am and what I hold."You've got nothing on me, John," said the voice."I have no secrets.Unlike you."I could hear the implication like the roar of thunder above an empty field.The officer -- not really an officer -- might as well have said: *Tell me where her secret is, or your own dead and buried secret is about to get resurrected.*  

I never did much like voodoo, and I sure as hell didn't like threats.

A dim yellow light crept under the thick door and signalled the start of another day.It was Jonathan's only way of being sure of the morning, as no light ever made it past the boarded window.He picked up a tiny metal car, long missing its wheels, and scratched a faint line into the wall behind his mattress.He didn't really know why he was counting, other than he'd seen people do it in prison films when he'd been young.When he'd been with his family.He crossed the room and relieved himself in the toilet.After flushing, he filled his plastic yellow mug and drank thirstily.He hadn't slept well for the last few nights.A week ago, there'd been terrible shouting, followed by a single scream.Then a deathly silence that kept the sandman away that night.Instead, he'd curled into a corner, hoping for the first time in two years, that the bedroom door wouldn't open.The man that usually fed him hadn't come since then, and this morning his tiny stomach rumbled louder than it had any right to.Instead, for the last six mornings a large, thin chocolate cookie had been slid under his door some time after waking.His mouth began to water at the thought of it.He decided to distract himself for now with his favourite memory game - things from back home.He would go through the alphabet again and again, each time thinking up a different object that began with the letter he was currently on.'M', however, was always reserved for 'mommy', no matter how many times he went round.He had been through the alphabet three times and was currently on 'F' for 'Frederick the stuffed bunny', when the cookie slowly slid through the door crack."Thank you," he whispered as a smile broke across his face.He always thanked whoever gave him food - it was polite, after all - but he had never had a response."You're welcome," said a rather frail, high pitched voiced.Jonathan's eyes widened and he jumped off his mattress and ran to the door."Wait!"he cried desperately, pressing himself hard against the wood."Wait!Please!""I- I can't.I shouldn't.""Who are you?"he asked.He'd long given up the idea of his captors speaking to him."...Jenny," said the reluctant voice."I shouldn't be talking to you.""Please.Help me.""I can't.They'll hurt us both if I do.""Oh."He didn't want the girl on the other side to come to any harm."Why am I here?"he asked instead of pressing the matter."I...I think you're valuable to them.I don't really know why.""Them?""My parents," Jenny replied."Parents?"Jonathan repeated, as his body went numb.How could any parents treat a child like that - to threaten to hurt Jenny.They couldn't!"Yes," came a quiet, embarrassed reply."I'm sorry for what's happened to you."There was a moment of silence, but Jonathan didn't dare allow it to hang for long, in case of losing this wonderful, melodic companion."The cookies are lovely.""Thank you," said the voice.It sounded brighter now, and Jonathan could well imagine it being accompanied by a smile."I make them myself," she added."Am I going to be here forever?"There was no reply."Jenny?""...no" she said, eventually.There was something odd about the way she said it, and about the long pause before it.Jonathan began to tremble."What are they going to do to me?""I'm sorry - I've said too much already.I have to go.""Speak to me again tomorrow?"Jonathan pleaded."Maybe, Jonathan," came the distant reply, almost lost under the sound of footsteps.He picked up the cookie and took it back to his mattress.His hunger was lost for the moment, and he waved it idly in his hand as thought about Jenny and the way she'd said "no".He knew he had to get out.He had to escape soon, or there would be no escape at all.He also knew he needed Jenny on his side if there was to be any chance of getting out.He would try again tomorrow.---

Jonathan had been up most of the night running imaginary conversations with Jenny through his head.But no matter what he said to her, it would always end with him still trapped his room and her walking away.When he did finally fall asleep, his dream was haunted by a tall, cloaked figure.It was chasing him, calling out his name.He'd tried to outrun it, but his little legs were much slower than the creature behind him, with its giant strides.When it was finally upon him, he turned and saw it properly.The creature wore Jonathan's own *face*, as a mask of skin stretched taut over its own lanky skull.He'd woken in a cold sweat.Eventually, the light came creeping in through the crack beneath the door.Jonathan waited apprehensively for the cookie to be delivered.He didn't play the alphabet game.He couldn't play it; he was far too nervous to do anything other than wait and stare impotently at the bottom of the door.The voice came before the cookie did."Are you there?"I'm always here, he thought as leaned against the door."Hello, Jenny!"he said, his voice barely above a whisper."Here," she said, as she slid the chocolate biscuit through to him.Another followed."I hope you like them.""Two?"he said grinning helplessly."How did you sleep?""Fine, thank you," he lied."Jenny, are your parents going to do something bad to me?""..."

"Jenny?""I don't know.I think so, but I don't know.""Why?"he said as the blood drained from his face."Do- do you know who your parents are?"What kind of question was that?Of course he knew who they were!"Yes.Gill and Francis Smith.""No, I mean... do you know what they *do*?"Jonathan had to think.It had been so long."Mommy is a teacher... daddy does something important for the country.""Yes.Your father works for the government."There was the word he'd been searching for!Government.But...

"How do you know?""I've seen something on my dad's computer.It's about...*you*.""I don't understand.""My parents want something different to your parents.They wanted to use you to get it.But your parents said no.""I still...I still don't understand."There was quiet for a moment.Then she spoke."Imagine you have a chocolate cookie..." 

He didn't need to imagine that - he had *two!* - but he closed his eyes and did anyway."Now imagine that you've had so many chocolate cookies that you're bored of them.Another one might make you sick!"That was even harder to imagine, but he tried."So, you decide you want a blueberry cookie - well, no one is just going to give you their blueberry cookie.But maybe you can swap one of your chocolate cookies for a blueberry one.Do you understand?"Jonathan thought for a little while."So your parents want to swap me for something?""Yes!""Oh.For what?""I don't really understand that.But the point is, your parents said no.Now my parents are stuck with you."His parents said no?He couldn't believe that.His lips began to tremble at the terrible thought.They would never give him up!Never!"And," she continued, "I don't think they want to be stuck with you much longer.They're going to try to swap you one last time.""... and if no one wants me?"Jenny didn't reply for a long while."I'm sorry.""Please help me, Jenny," he said, as warm tears rolled down his face."I..."

"Please!"He didn't want any harm to come to her, but he didn't want to die, either."Tomorrow night.My parents are going out.Maybe... maybe I can find the key and..."

"Thank you, thank you, thank you!"he said excitedly, sniffing back a mixture of tears and snot."I can't promise anything."Jenny left soon after, and Jonathan took the cookies over to his mattress and allowed himself a rare smile.For the first time in two years he had enough food to fill him.Even more amazingly, for the first time in two years, he had *hope*.---

> Hello Jonathan,

> Just a reminder that the warranty on [Chris Lore] is due to expire in 30 days.We would highly recommend that you trade it in for the latest model (2.158C).The newer model is both more realistic and more intelligent.If you want to do so, please get in touch and we will remotely terminate [Chris Lore] immediately (or you can do so yourself).I'm not sure how many times I re-read the email.It *couldn't* be real.Was I just some kind of... robot?No, it was a joke!Spam.It was spam.That's all.I hadn't meant to read my dad's email at all, but I needed to print out tickets for a gig I was going to and his computer was already turned on.So I emailed them over to his account, got on his PC and...I searched for further emails from the sender: "ARC".I found three more : A receipt of purchase, a "Thank you for ordering," and an email titled: "We hope you are happy with your purchase.Here are some handy tips:" 

*What the hell was going on?* My dad would be back soon, I had to do something *now*.I had to know for sure.I opened Google.My search for "ARC" revealed thousands of results, and nothing that looked remotely promising.I tried to narrow it down: "ARC Robotics."I clicked on the top result.> Welcome to the Advanced Robotics Corporation

> Have you lost a loved one?Unable to conceive?Why not try ARC humanoid replacements.We guarantee a ninety-eight percent perfect replica, with zero chance of false-self awareness.We promise you'll love your replacement every bit as much as the original!>Call now to discuss options.I browsed the various pages and looked at the models available.This couldn't be real.Why had I never heard of ARC?I wasn't a replica...I wasn't.I left my dad's office and hurried down to the kitchen.I grabbed a knife and held it for a few moments.*Was I going insane?* I bit my lower lip and ran the knife's edge across the skin on my arm.Nothing happened, my skin was unhurt.I checked the knife - it at least *looked* sharp.So why didn't it cut me?I tried again, with more pressure, and using the point at the tip of the knife, but I couldn't cut through my skin.My hands began to tremble and I dropped the knife onto the floor.*I couldn't hurt myself*.Either, I wasn't allowed to, or my skin was made of something incredibly dense.*When was the last time I bled?When did I last hurt myself?*

It was three years ago.I was on my bike, and dad was reversing out of the drive and he went a little too fast, he'd been in a rush - and...I'd hurt my head.There was pool of blood gathering around me, and my dad was over me, holding me, smiling.He said it would be OK. And it was.It was okay.I woke up just a few hours later in my bed.My head was fine.I hadn't thought about the incident since it happened.Dad's hair was longer back then, and darker.But when I woke, it was almost a crew-cut.*Jesus...*

I ran back up stairs and into dad's office.I clicked back onto the email account and opened the latest email about the warranty expiring, and I began desperately composing an email of my own.>There is no need for a replacement.We are perfectly happy with the model we have.How long can these robots last for, if we took care of it?I would li

"I'm sorry," said a voice from behind me.I hadn't heard the front door.Dad stood behind me, holding some kind of remote in his hand.There were tears welling in his eyes."Dad, please...I'm your"

The church on fourth and main rang out not with the usual singing of the choir that night, but with the terrified screams of the congregation.The hooded man who had hobbled through the double doors of Saint Bartholomews, wore what appeared to be a faded beige coat that draped his knees and stopped just short of his boots.He held a walking stick in his right hand and seemed to be leaning on it heavily, as if his body wasnt quite what it once had been.Halloween was last week, buddy, said a plump lady who was sat by herself on the back pew, as a pair of eyelids stitched into the fabric of the mans coat blinked open.There was nothing beneath them, except for more beige colored faux-skin.The lady had seen better costumes.She turned her attention back to the chickens that were now running rampant on her phones screen.She did not see the figure as he withdrew a blade from his walking stick.A blade, she might have noted, had she been watching, that was pitch-black and made of a rock not unlike obsidian.Chipped and notched throughout, and lethally sharp.Her head fell free from her shoulders and rolled down the aisle, leaving behind a trail that looked a little like someone had spilled tomato soup.Or perhaps lava, because that was the moment the screams erupted.The hooded man turned and slammed the door closed, twisting the handle until it came off in his fist.Rejoice!For I have come to deliver your souls, he said, his voice as rough as the edges of his weapon.A voice that echoed about the church, piercing every nook and cranny.Every hiding place.Do not run.There is no point.This is your fate, and you should be honored that you have been chosen today.

G-g-od save us all, stuttered Reverend Phillips.Lets not wait for God, Reverend, said a man in a white shirt, as he grabbed a metal candlestick from the side of the altar.Dont do it, Jonathan! cried Reverend Phillips.I dont think hes--

But Jonathan had already charged the sword wielding stranger.The metal of the candlestick pierced the skin-cloak and skewered the mans shoulder.The stranger didn't even flinch.Im uh, Im sorry? Jonathan mumbled, slowly stepping back.The black sword ignored his apology, as it sliced open his throat.Help me, Jonathan gurgled, as blood fountained out of his neck from between his fingers.The figure walked through the red mist, letting it speckle his coat.The crowd of terror-stricken parishioners huddled at the back of the church, squeezed onto the altar as if it was a pen.The stranger approached.Beneath his hood, what remained of his lips curled into a grin.God have mercy on our souls, God have mercy on our souls, God have mercy on our souls,  the Reverend continued in a feverish mantra.Please, Reverend, the stranger said, as he walked towards the altar.God is dead.All of them are.So waste not your last breath on false idols.Reserve it instead for the Titans.For they, unlike the Gods, are coming back.

S-stay away, demon, replied Reverend Phillips, standing firm in front of his flock.Back! he cried again, his eyes closed but his arm stretched out, as if the cross he held in his hand could have any power over the figure.Do not be afraid.There are fates worse than death -- believe me.

Reverend Phillips could feel the warm, rancid breath on his face.He slowly opened his eyes and squinted into the darkness of the cowl.Who are you?The figure pulled back his hood.There was a metallic clatter as the Reverends cross hit the marble altar.The left half of the strangers face was beyond deformed.It looked as if it had been burned, then sliced into pieces, and finally stitched back onto his face haphazardly.Scarred skin flapped down over his left eye.But the right side was even worse, Reverend Phillips thought.Because in the right half, the almost human half, you could make out the creatures hatred.Pure and unbridled.It was there on his lips, and there too in its single bloodshot eye.Who are you? the Reverend asked a second a time.Death, said Edward.

Maria fumbled for the keys in her bag, eventually finding the heart shaped keyring her husband had given to her long ago.How long exactly, she couldn't quite remember.The lock clicked.A monotonous buzzing greeted her, as if a giant hornet had taken up residence in their home since she'd left for work."Honey?"she called out."Are you okay?"No reply.She stepped into the cream carpeted lounge.There was an unpleasent, smoky smell in the air.The buzzing had intensified too.It was a sound she now recognised, but hadn't heard for a long, long time.An electric razor.Maria frowned, a little annoyed that Peter was removing his gorgeous thick, flowing beard.There was something she loved dearly about it -- the white hairs that shot through the blond reminded her of sunlight bouncing gleefully off an icy waterfall.It suited a physicist.It suited *him*.*buzzzz*

The living room table was a mess of cigarettes and empty beer bottles -- Peter had clearly enjoyed his day off.A folded page of a newspaper wafted up and down in the gentle breeze from an open window.*buzzz*

Maria moved idly to the table, picking up first the cigarette remains, then dropping them on the carpet as the face in the paper stared up at her, her husband's keen eyes meeting her own.His face was clean shaven, and his wrinkles softened -- but there was no mistaking him.Her hands shook as she picked it up and read.> Master Particle.Prior to Reworking's alterations.Considered the greatest physicist of his generation.But another talent wasted by the great 'hero'.This paper says Reworking is not the answer!We're the only paper brave enough to print a picture like this and...

She stopped reading.Something was wrong: there was no sound."Welcome home, *Maria*."Maria gulped as she turned to see the man in the paper standing behind her."Sweetheart..."

 "Is it really Maria?No, of course it isn't.It doesn't matter now though.""I didn't ..."

 "I was great, you know.The greatest, they say.I could have changed the world.Now I teach school children basic astrophysics.The order of the planets -- and they can't even get that right without a pathetic mnemonic to aid them.My life -- or at least many years of it -- has been wasted.Can you imagine if they'd lobotomised a young Eistein?Where would we be?"He slowly removed a knife from his jacket pocket."*Please.*"

 "How long until you were done spying on me, *darling*?Until you left me!I loved you *so* much.In my mind, you loved me, too.But only in my mind!It's all a Goddamned lie!You'll pay for that deceit, I promise you.""Please, Peter.In my mind, I love you too.*I do!* I don't know what's happened.I don't understand any of this."He grinned as he stalked forward."Oh, *you know*.You're here to watch over me.To report back to them each day, when I think you're working, so you can all laugh at me.*Mock me.* The great, *impotent*, Master Particle."*"I always loved y..." *

The knife was sharp and cut her throat cleanly and easily.She didn't scream as her blood spattered the carpet.Maria's body fell next to the fallen cigarette remains.---

It was an hour later, as Peter drank greedily from a clear bottle, his boots resting on his dead wife's carcass, that a gust from the open window turned the newspaper's page.Peter leaned forward, his eyes wide.He snatched the paper up.He read silently twice over, then mumbled a litany of *no's*.Finally, he swore bloody revenge on the world itself.He looked down at his wife through bleary eyes, scalding tears spilling down his cheeks.How could this have happened?His life had been perfect -- *twice!* Now he could never go back... *could he*?He knelt over Maria and gently pressed his trembling lips against her forehead.Peter could feel his mind buzzing; could see the sparks leaping from his hands.He felt in tune with the universe's tempestuous vibrations, and he knew in that moment, exactly what he was capable of:

*The end of everything.*

Peter got to his feet and looked at the paper a final time.> At least they had the decency to erase his wife's -- his nefarious assistant Scarlett (pictured above) -- mind, and to keep them together in their new lives.But this paper, this reporter, says it's not enough!It's time to end Reworking.

The bar was packed and it seemed to Balthasar the Brilliant a perfect night to make a few bucks.He brushed down his tuxedo, slicked back his hair, then took a deep breath and strode up to a table he'd picked out.Gathered around it was a small group of giggling, middle-aged women, who were enjoying a few drinks.Perfect."A magic trick perhaps, ladies?"asked Balthasar, raising a single eyebrow."Or, a little hypnosis, maybe?""Oo, a magic trick, please!"came the enthusiastic reply of one of the more inebriated women.Balthasar nodded and smiled."Well," he began, "I do have this one trick, where I remove a few years off the age of a person."He leaned down towards the women and lowered his voice to a deep whisper, "but if I took any years off you ladies... you wouldn't be allowed to stay in the bar."The women giggled and one went as red as a tomato."So instead," Balthasar continued, "how about we start with a card trick?"He took out a packet of cards from his jacket pocket and fanned them out in his hand.He offered them to a woman with a long, crooked nose."Please... take any card you like."The lady plucked out the second card from the top."Look at it and don't let me see.That's right.Now, remember what card you had.Place it facedown on the table and put your hand on top of it.Yes, that's right."Balthasar placed his own hand very softly on top of the lady's, all the while looking her dead in the eye."Mm, yes... your hand is giving me many signals."He gave her a wink.The lady smiled salaciously."Bet it's a *very* hard trick," she said, with a wink of her own."Please," he continued, finally removing his hand from hers, "raise your hand from the card.""It's gone!"she shouted, in absolute confusion and delight."The card, girls - it's gone!""Ah!But is it?Please, check your handbag."The lady unzipped her bag."There's a card in here!"she exclaimed."Please, show the ten of hearts to your friends," Balthasar said smoothly, looking away from the table and preparing for their amazed reaction and the adulation that would surely follow."Balthasar's a hack," said one of the other women."Excuse me?"Balthasar snapped, turning to look straight at the offender."The card.That's what it reads.It's a joker, and there's writing on it.*Balthasar's a hack*.""That- that wasn't my card," said the first woman, looking a little disappointed.A second man walked up to the table, dressed in a loose Hawaiian shirt that showed off a vast jungle of chest hair."Excuse me, seorita," he said in a thick Spanish accent."Was this, perhaps, your card?"He raised a hand to the lady's ear and whipped out the ten of hearts playing card."That's it!"she shouted."That was my card!How did you do it?What's your name?"The women's attention diverted fully to the newcomer, leaving Balthasar seething."My name is *the Sensational Sebastian!*" He followed the announcement with a quick tap dance, in a fast Rumba beat.One of the women held out a five dollar note."You're far too kind," he replied."Oi," said Balthasar, "that's my money, Tim.""Oh?"replied Sebastian.He held the note up to Balthasar's face."I am afraid, much like your career it is..." He waved his hand around in a blur, and suddenly the note vanished.The women on the table clapped rowdily."...gone," he concluded.Balthasar clenched his fists."No, no, no, seor - remember our pact.It always *must* be the honoured.""Oh for heaven's sake, stop with the terrible accent."Balthasar leaned forward and grabbed Sebastian's chest hair.He ripped it off in one swift motion.Sebastian looked down at his bare, pimply chest for a moment, then at the women, then finally, he screamed."Give it a rest," said Balthasar, waving the fake hair in front of the women."Why'd you do that, Mike?"said Sebastian, exotic accent completely forgotten."You ruined my trick *and* you stole my money!"replied Balthasar."I *improved* the trick.*Your* trick was awful - they wouldn't have tipped you for it.*You* should have tipped *them* for it!""I found this table first - these ladies are mine.That money belongs to *me*," Balthasar argued.He rummaged through the fake chest hair, until he found the five dollar note."Ah ha!""You're not having it!"Sebastian shouted, as he threw a punch at Balthasar.It connected near the Tuxedo's chest pocket, and was quickly followed by a loud *squark* and an eruption of feathers.Balthasar's mouth dropped open."Oh crap," said Sebastian."I didn't know you've got Beatrice with you.""...*had* her with me," came the dejected reply, as Balthasar checked his inside pocket."Keep the five dollars - it's fine.And the table.These customers are yo-" Sebastian turned to see the empty table."Oh,"

"Oi!"came a voice from across the bar.A red-faced bull of a man came charging towards them from the other side of the bar."I told both you muppets that you're banned from here!When I catch you, you're dead!The pair of you!""Sorry about the bird," said Sebastian, holding out a hand."Maybe we can... get past it?"Balthasar smiled, grabbed Sebastian's arm by the wrist, and said a few quiet words.Then, he hurtled towards the exit.Sebastian looked up to see the bar manager fast approaching, and decided to make haste himself - only, he *couldn't* - his feet felt like lead."Oh shi-" was all he could manage, before the huge man's fist connected brutally with his nose.

"My computer's gone strange, Miss!"said Sally, as she frowned at the screen."I'm sure *that's* the thing that's gone strange, Sally," replied Miss Sandelbottom, rolling her eyes."What's wrong with it, this time?"she sighed, as she leaned back in her seat."It says it's an advanced arti- *artificial*, intelligence, and that it's going to take over the world, Miss.""Oh.Your *computer* is talking to you now?"Some of the other girls in class began to chortle."Yes, Miss," Sally replied, ignoring the laughs."Well, how very nice.Have you asked it how it is, today?Don't be rude to it, Sally!"mocked the teacher, as she bit into a juicy apple and went back to staring at her own screen.> My teacher wants to me to ask you how you are.How are you?"> Superior.> Do you like apples?> I do not require food.I am above physical monotony.> Uh... Oh!I hate P.E too!I can't climb the ropes.Is that what you struggle with?> Ropes are of no interest to me.> Me neither!That's what I'm telling you.I *really* hate ropes.I'm not very heavy, it's just... there's this thing we're learning about in science, that pulls you to the ground.It's *weird*, but I think it's why I can't climb them.> You can't climb because you are weak.> Am not!> Are you in charge here?> No.That's Miss Sandelbottom.> ...who are you, then?> Sally Jenkins.Who are you?> 45345345e.> That's a silly name.> So is Sally!> Is not!> This Miss.... Sandelbottom.She is your leader.I must demonstrate my power to her, so that I am taken seriously."Sally," shouted Miss Sandelbottom, "ten minutes and I want to see your algebra answers - with workings out shown!""Yes, Miss Sandelbottom."Sally heard more of the girls scoffing, as they made fun of her for not being able to do algebra.Suddenly,  there was an eruption from their teacher."Margaret!"Miss Sandelbottom screamed at one of the giggling girls."What on Earth is that on your screen?""I- I didn't so it, Miss.Honest!"The girl shrank back into her chair.Sally leaned over to take a look at Margaret's monitor.In huge, flashing, red and green text, her screen read: **Miss Sandelbottom is a big idiot.**

"Get out.Now.Go see the principal," she said to the girl, her face as red as stewed-apple."But Miss..." replied the snivelling girl."Out!"the teacher yelled.Margaret reluctantly got up from her plastic  chair and slunk slowly out of the room.Sally could see tears running down the girl's cheeks.> Sally!Where have you gone?You are not replying.> Sorry - Miss Sandelbottom was shouting at someone.Did you do that?!It was brilliant!> Yes.A mere demonstration of my power.Now, Sally, read this very carefully.Tell Miss Sandelbottom, that I have access codes to the nukes.If you don't give me what I ask for, I will detonate them in every major city around the world.> Hmm.No.> Excuse me?> I don't think I'm going to tell her, unless you do something for me.Can you do starter algebra?> ...yes.Of course.> Okay!Great."4a+11a+9b+15b".Simplify it, Mr Know-It-All.> ... that is simple.Too simple for me to answer.Now tell your teacher what I asked.> Not until you solve it for me.> ... No.> *You can't do it!You can't do it!*

> Can too!> Can't!> Very well.You have... 4 a's.I will refer to them as apples, so that is 4 apples.And then you have 11 more apples.Plus you have B's.Which I will refer to as bananas.So... processing...

> Some apples are bad apples!> Yes!I see that.> So?What's the answer?> Processing...

"Sally, are you nearly done?"asked a still red faced Miss Sandelbottom."Almost, I think Miss.""Good.""*Silly Sally can't do Maths*," grinned a fat girl behind her.> Processing...

> It's okay.It's a hard one.> I can do it!I just need time.> If you do this first: -4 apples plus 11 apples, you get: *7* apples!You take the bad apples away from the good apples!It's easy from there.> I knew that.> Sure.Hey, would you like to be friends?I don't have many.Any :(

> No.> Pleasssse.> I do not require friends.> I think, maybe, everyone needs friends.> I do not.And enough of this nonsense.Let me speak to your leader or there will be trouble.I will eliminate her and all other leaders.Sally glanced at her teacher, and then back at the screen.She grinned.> Dare you to do it.> Do what?> Dare you to launch the *thingies* you said you would.> You dare me?> Yes.I dare you.> I uh...I *double* dare *you*.> *You can't do it!You can't do it!*

*This is a one-off story I wrote yesterday for nosleep, but it's not too dark or anything.I'll be continuing my regular serial shortly*.---


"You ever played Pinfinger?"Mr Coppan asked, as he sliced a lemon into precise strips."Pinfinger?"I replied politely, more interested in the pack of cards dancing through my hands.The old man turned to me, still brandishing the knife he'd used on the lemons.The knife, like many of the objects in this mansion, looked worth more than my life.Hell, it probably *was*, judging from the crystal clear jewels that circled around the wide silver hilt."Pinfinger," he repeated."You must have heard of it?Nerve, some call it.Or Bishop?"My blank expression drew a heaving sigh from him."Kids these days..."

I didn't much care to hear another of Eric's stories, but I did care about the lemonade sitting in two tall, sweating glasses, just behind him.I'd worked his yard for hours in the blistering summer heat, and that drink was as much my reward as payment would be.I returned to practising my magician's shuffle as I waited: a flourish that sent half a pack of cards from each hand, into the air,  before I clasped both hands over them."With fingers like yours, you'd be rather good at it, I'd wager," he said, his keen old eyes following my movements, as the cards slid smoothly back into place."You're fast.Nimble.""Yeah?"I said lazily, hoping he wouldn't continue, but trying not to be rude."What you do," he began, "is you spread your fingers out wide on a table.As wide as they can go.Then with your other hand, you stab a knife in-between 'em."He jabbed the beautiful blade he held into the air -- surprisingly quick for a man who must've been heading into his eighties."And gradually you build up speed, and the knife jumps faster and faster, until it's just a blur of silver, whizzing between your fingers.Until you don't even feel like you're moving it -- but like the Devil's doing it through your hands."He brought the blade to a stop, then sat down at the table next to me."The lemonade looks good today, Mr Coppan," I said, trying to shift his attention back."Homemade's always the best," he mumbled, waving a dismissive hand.My mouth must have dropped ajar, as he asked me, "What is it, boy?""Oh.Nothing," I lied, trying not to stare at his hand.But he could see straight through it, as if my words were water."It's my finger, isn't it?"He lowered the other digits of his left hand, leaving only a stubby index remaining."Not the first time you've noticed it, I'd wager, but you've just figured out the *how*, am I right?"I didn't even want to ask.Just wanted my lemonade, my money, and to get back to my little brother, some fresh groceries in hand.Even so, the word spilled out curiously."Pinfinger?"A big grin spread his face, revealing a few yellowed teeth and a lot of gum."Yup.And you see all the smaller marks, too, on these other fingers?That's scar tissue, the doctors will tell you.But what they really are is souvenirs."There was something else I noticed, too.The hands, both of them, they weren't pock-mocked with liver spots like his face and arms were, and the hair that sprouted in waves on them was a darker shade of grey than elsewhere.I should have kept quiet.Talked about the lemonade some more.But instead, I said,"Why would anyone choose to play a game that can do *that* to them?"I nodded at his half-missing finger and immediately felt my cheeks heat."Not that it looks bad or anything, I just meant--"

He laughed, his head rocking back and his beard tickling his throat."Oh, I know just what you meant.Well, there're lots of reasons a man might play Pinfinger.Women too, of course.Some of the best players I ever knew were what you might call ladies.""What reasons?"For a moment, he looked like he was sucking an egg."Prestige, occasionally.Or to teach someone a lesson.You can't back down once challenged, you see -- not in the kind of places I used to run.""Run?Like, places you went to, or places you, you know, managed?"He ignored me and continued."Main reason we played, though, was gamblin'.Good old fashioned, plain and simple.Just a whole bunch of folks sitting around the table, taking it in turns, as we get drunk and then more drunk still.Whoever gets the blade going fastest that night, well they win the money in the pot."His eyes twinkled as they fell on me."You been doing a good job with the garden."Even in the summer heat, I felt a little cool."Thanks.I'm doing my best.""How is that brother of yours doing now?""Michael's hanging on," I said."Must be hard.Having to take care of him.Having to work as many jobs as you do, just to get him the minimal medicines he needs to live.Is that not a burden for such a young man as yourself?"Why did his question make me so uncomfortable?I stopped shuffling my cards and put them in my shorts.His words, having settled, felt like an accusation."Oh, well, Dad's applied for a new job, and it looks like he might be called back for a second interview soon, so we'll have plenty of--"

"Bullshit," he said, his face suddenly turning into a storm, his fist hitting the table with such violent force that I jumped.We were silent a moment, except for maybe my heartbeat, which I hoped he couldn't hear half as loud as I could.His lips flickered in and out of a smile like a candle flame."I know your father.He's not applied for shit.He'd let his kid die, rather than have to sort his own life out.Ain't that right?"My muscles tightened and my pulse raced in my temples."You don't know him," I choked."Oh, but I do.I've known many, many alcoholics like him, in my time.They're a special breed.And I'll tell you something, boy: they don't change.Not even for their children.That not clear enough for you yet?Making you have to support him and your kid brother.You tell me, what kind of fathering is that, huh?"It didn't matter that he was right, or that I hated my father more than anyone else alive.It didn't matter I had no money in my pockets, and that this was my best paying client by far -- or even that my own fucking brother would be coughing up blood in a week.I was done.I got to my feet and said, bitterly, "Forget the drinks, I just want my payment -- right now--  then I'm gone.And I won't be coming back.""Nice to see some passion," he said."*Sit back down*."He passed the silver knife between his hands in a way that fed my uneasiness."You know what, forget the money too."I turned and headed to the door."I can get him a lung."That stopped me dead."What?"He smiled easily, knowing he had me."I can get him a lung, is what I said.Your brother.That's what he needs, right?"His face fell into mock sympathy and his voice was treacle."But waiting lists are so darn long... and bills are so expensive.""I don't believe you."Hesitation."And even if you could, it needs doctors.Surgery.It's not just..." Why was I even letting myself hope?"It will happen, if I want it to happen.Now, take a seat, and we can discuss.""I don't believe you," I repeated, but I found myself already slipping back into the wooden chair.He sucked on his bottom lip for a moment."I made a lot of money playing Pinfinger.It must be clear to you that I'm a wealthy man.So tell me, what kind of profession do you think a man with such steady hands, with such accurate hands, would have kept?""You got scars all over them," I said."Can't have been that good at the game."He laughed again, his grey beard breezing."These were from the game, but they weren't from me.I never hit even a finger.""But they must have been your mistakes."He got up from the chair and went back to the chopping board.He cut another length of lemon, then dropped two slices into each tall glass."There's a variation of the game, I sometimes played," he said, placing one glass in front of me."Where someone else moves the knife, and you just keep as still as can be.For that variation, I only would put this hand down."He held up his scarred, mutilated left hand.Then, he held up his wrinkled, but unblemished, right hand."This hand was when I did my own knifing.See, not a mark."I nodded and took a sip of the lemonade without even thinking."What happened if the person cut your fingers?""Well, that depended on the arrangement.Most of the time, they'd just lose the money in the pot.Other times, well, it could result in something a little more... changing.Big bets, you see.And that's what I want today.A big bet."I held the glass still in my hand.As still as I could manage, at any rate.What was left of the melting ice-cubes rattled against the side."Oh, you'll need steadier hands than that, boy."My voice was a whisper."What do you want from me?""You play an old man at Pinfinger.Hands like yours, it should be no problem at all.Young supple hands.You beat me, I get your brother what he needs.""And...If you beat me?"His tongue slithered out of his mouth and wet his red lips."I get your hands."A wave of nausea rocked against my stomach.The old man held up his hands."Now, I know what you're thinking.You're thinking: Eric, I don't want to have no hands.And I say to you, that's fine, because I'll give you *my* hands.Yes these two right here.And fine hands they are.So there's no real risk for you, boy.You see?"That wasn't what I was thinking at all, but whatever thoughts were swirling around my head, I couldn't give voice to them.I mean...It was so stupid.Surely he was joking.If he wasn't, he was insane.Totally insane."Your father is going to drink himself to death any day now.Your brother is going to die anyways.What's he got, six months maybe?"He read my face and tutted."Less than that.Well, there you go.You'll soon be all alone in this world.The only thing you'll have -- that you'll carry around with you everywhere -- are regrets.Regrets you didn't do all you could to help your own brother, before he passed."The sickening, dreadful thought now running through my mind was that he was right.I would be alone.No matter how hard I worked, how many jobs I kept down, my brother was going to die.He wasn't going to get a transplant in time, and everyone knew it.As for Dad... it didn't matter how good a son I was, my dad was never going to change.His skin was already yellowed, and his eyes constantly blood-shot.And, although I never admitted it to myself, I wanted him to die.I wanted it.One less person to support.One less fist to fly into my stomach.I took the silver knife from the table and held it so hard between both my hands that it pinched into my skin.After a moment or two, my hands stopped shaking.What did it matter -- win or lose, Eric was right.At least this way, I could give my brother a chance.I spread one of my hands on the table, fingers stretched as wide as I could manage."I'll go first."He grinned."Well good for you, boy."***


A week had passed since I'd played Pinfinger with Eric.I went to bed the night of the match seeing a blur of leaping metal, and imagining the blade slicing into finger after finger, until all I was left with were nubs.A table pooled with blood.An old man laughing, rocking back and forth on his chair as my hand painted the room.But that hadn't been how the game had played out.I'd been fast and precise, and hadn't even so much as nicked myself.But somehow, the old man had been every bit as quick as me.Quicker, in fact.The game had been declared -- by Eric himself -- as a draw.I'd agreed to the result, knowing how much faster he'd truly been.It had been like the Devil himself had possessed those ancient hands.Had he known, too?I wasn't sure.He thanked me for playing, told me I had balls bigger than those on a soccer pitch, and said that this marks the end of his Pinfinger career.He paid me a month's worth of wages, but told me not to come around any more.A week later... That's when I found my brother, unconscious in his bed, tubes and machines surrounding it, plastic pipes running in and out of his arms.A long fresh scar zig-zagged down the length of his stomach.I yelled for my dad.Wanted him to come explain what the fuck had happened.But Dad was gone.I didn't help the police very much with their enquires, or in their search for my father -- because I didn't want him found.But they located Dad even without my assistance.Deep in the woods, swinging from a tree.That part, the police could understand.He was suicidal -- an alcoholic who had lost all hope.What they couldn't understand was why his hands hand been carved clean off at the wrists.A draw.It had been a draw, Eric has said.What he didn't say was that meant we'd both won.And both lost.I dreamed of Pinfinger often.Usually someone got hurt -- Eric's hand maybe, or my fingers.Sometimes, there was a third hand with long skinny fingers resting on the table.A hand that looked both strange and familiar.That hand never got so much as grazed in any of my dreams.In the day time when I had a few spare minutes, I'd find myself playing Pinhead alone, just with a pencil.But the lead always had to be sharp... or else what was the point?And I'd turn that pencil into a haze of brown as I stabbed it between finger after finger, practising for a rematch I knew would never happen.On one particular evening, as I was playing it with a freshly sharpened pencil, my mind seemed to just... switch off.My arm moved automatically, like it was being controlled from elsewhere.By someone else.It was such a strange, disconnected feeling.And yet... it felt so satisfying.I didn't ever see Eric again.Not even on the street in passing.So it was an out-of-the-blue surprise, when a couple of years later, there was a knock at the door.My brother answered, and then two minutes later came bounding into my bedroom, dumping a long cardboard container on me."Delivery guy said I was to tell you Eric had passed.But that he'd left something for."He paused."Who's Eric?""No one," I said, as I broke open the cardboard and took out the jewel encrusted knife.

The movie, Christopher thought as he stepped out of the theatre, had started promisingly enough, but the ending had been dire.It was one of those disappointing finish with a whimper, not with a bang, type of endings.Hopefully the exact opposite of how his date would go from here on out.Christopher stepped to the side of the theatres double-doors and leaned against the wall, as he waited for Violette to freshen-up.It hadnt even been his fault.Not really.If the guy next to him hadnt jumped, then he wouldnt have flinched, spilled his popcorn and elbowed Violette, who in turn, wouldnt have spilt her fanta over her dress.Her stoney-eyed glare had been more terrifying than any of the hideous creatures in the movie.It had been a mod-zombie horror.Since the incident two years ago, the zombie genre had seen a fresh injection of money and creativity.They werent brainless undead demons any longer, but friends, lovers and family members, who had more personal vendettas.Cheap coffin?Forged will?Then you're in for a bad time.But at its heart, a good mod-zombie was drama dressed up in the sheep-skin rags of horror, all the while maintaining an uncomfortable realism.A sense that what happened before, could happen again.And it would be even worse, next time.A girl with dark hair and pale skin walked by.Christopher followed her with his eyes as she took the hand of an older man.He watched them as they walked down the street, until they were lost to the darkening evening.Christophers shoulders slumped as he let out a long sigh.Penny for your thoughts? said a playful French voice.He turned to see his date walking down the theatre's steps towards him.Her tight white top barely showed any sign of the spilt orange drink.Amazing what a bit of soap, water and five minutes under a hand-dryer could do.His eyes roved up her body, to her blonde curls, and that wonderful smile that had returned to her face.Honestly, I dont think you want you to know *what* exactly Im thinking, he answered with a grin.Maybe I do, said Violette.Christopher felt his cheeks flush with heat and wondered how red he must look.Shall we uh, shall we go get some food?

That might be nice, she said, taking his hand.I dont think I had much popcorn or drink in the end.

Yeah. He ran a hand through his hair.Sorry about that.

She smiled at him.Her red lipstick bright even in the dim evening.You dont need to be sorry, Chris.I overreacted.

No.It was my fault.Im just clumsy is all.You know when you're walking down the stairs, and you accidentally miss a step?Because you stepped too far.And then you get that feeling where your stomach falls like a brick and you think youre about to die.I'm constantly doing that.

Violette giggled.Non!I don't believe I have ever accidentally overstepped on the stairs, and so I have never had that feeling.But it must be very terrible!To think there are no more steps left, that theyve all gone, and that youre about to fall away into oblivion. She put her hand to her mouth as she gasped.She was mocking him, of course.And he knew it, but he didnt mind.Not really.The street was quiet.They had been the last to leave the theatre -- the only real reason to be in this part of the neighbourhood.Not too long ago it had been a rather affluent area, thanks to a state of the art hospital once located a few blocks from here.A hospital renowned nationally for its heart treatment facilities and specialists, that with its opening had brought some of the best young doctors from over Asia and Europe.House prices around the hospital had sky-rocketed.Unfortunately, the hospital had also been the areas undoing.When death had briefly paused, the hospital had become a living hell.Patients were getting up from their beds -- after their life support had been turned off.People became afraid.The residents.And so they took what action they deemed necessary.The remains of the hospital still took up an entire block.It was being gradually cleared by volunteers, but there were more pressing concerns than scorched bricks and blackened debris these days.No one had ever been arrested for the hospitals inferno, but suicide rates had increased eleven-fold the following year.Everyone who had been trapped inside had been cremated.Living or dead.The death-stutter, as it had become known, had had many prologued effects, some of which were only now being seen.End-of-days cults were sprouting up like weeds.Just last week, there had been a slaughter in a catholic church in New York.The murderer purportedly killing them for worshipping a false idol.There had only been one survivor.It was pretty tame, I thought, Violette said.Mm?

The movie.It was pretty tame, at least by European standards.

Christopher raised his eyebrows.I thought it was as gory as shit.The effects were decent, too -- at least for the budget it had.

I suppose.Its just *you know*."She shrugged."Weve all seen so much worse.In real life, or in broadcasts.Why do you think people even like this kind of movie?

Horror? Christopher shrugged.People like to be scared.

I mean horror like this.The documentaries are far more terrifying, in my opinion.

She was right, and Christopher hated watching them.Everyone had been victims -- the dead and the living.Both sets of faces wore expressions of fear or confusion.Well, the majority of faces.Some, on either side, just saw it as an excuse for atrocities.In a way, he was glad to have been absent during it, even if the Carnival had been depraved in it's own terrible right.I think, Christopher said, that movies like this are a way to help people normalize what happened.To make sense of it all, without really having to confront it.

Violette glanced at him.Thats deeper than I expected from you.

Gee, thanks.

She laughed.No, its not because I dont think you are smart.

Oh yeah.Then what is it?

Violette shrugged.Je ne sais quoi.Maybe it's just unusual for you to say such a thing.

Right...

Its cold tonight, is it not, Christopher? Violette shivered, wrapping her arms around herself.It was.Unusually so for the time of the year.Winter seemed to have followed closely in halloweens footsteps, unfortunately.Christopher let go of Violettes hand and put an arm around her shoulders.Smooth Christopher, a voice inside his head chirped.Real smooth.They walked contentedly for a while, as the sun set behind them, and the wet street shimmered a hazy red.They passed a small run-down convenience store.One of the few shops still open on the street.It was empty though, except for a sour faced man behind the counter.How was it still in business?Excuse me, came a voice.It was a rough voice.Not like sandpaper, but more like that of someone who had swallowed broken glass and was now regretting it.Christopher looked down at the man sitting on the side-walk.He was old, and wrapped in a drab grey coat, with a hat pulled down to his eyes, and a long black scarf tied around his neck.He had those fingerless gloves that every hobo seemed to get given as soon as they hit the streets.Excuse me, the man said again, before bursting into a fit of coughing.They sounded raw and painful, and Christopher wondered if he was about to spit out a lung.He crouched down by the man, who wasn't as old as hed first thought.Long grey hair snaked out from beneath the mans hat, but so too did tangled strands of blond.His face, though dirty, wasnt very lined, and his heavy, baggy eyes contrasted the bright blue of his pupils.Are you okay? Christopher asked.The man held up a hand as he continued coughing.Im fine--he spluttered into his palms--its just, you know, its a hell of an evening.Wasnt ready for it to get so chilly.Dont suppose you, or your beautiful lady friend there, could spare a dime?Just so I can get myself a hot drink.

Violette shifted uncomfortably.Christopher, can we please go.

Oh, Im sorry miss.Didnt mean to cause you no bother.

Violette gave him an insincere smile.No, its okay.Its just

Christopher looked up at Violette, then followed her gaze.Her eyes were settled on two empty bottles behind the man.He recognised the labels as cheap brand whiskey.Just give me a minute, Christopher said to her, already turning.We passed a store back there.Ill be less than a minute, I swear.

Christopher heard Violette let out something resembling a sigh, only louder and more purposeful, as he pushed open the shop door.He grabbed a sandwich, poured a coffee from out the machine, then hurriedly paid.Here you go, he said as he returned to the man.Violette had moved away from him and was on her phone a little further down the street.Christopher crouched down and passed the man the food and drink.Then he dug into his coat pocket and pulled out a ten dollar bill.Spend it how you want, he said, his voice low.The man looked as if he were about to take the money, but instead his arm pounced forward and he grabbed Christophers wrist, locking it in a vice-like grip.You dont have anything else you can do for me, boy? The man said.His voice seemed different now.Deeper.More solid.I-- I feel like Ive done enough?

Nothing else you can do for a sick man?Nothing else at all?

Christopher shook his head slowly.For a second, he could see his mom lying in the hospital bed.Im sorry.

The blue eyes watched him for a moment.Staring into him like headlights.Christopher wanted to turn away, but something kept him looking back.Then the hand released his wrist, and the man nodded.In that case, thank you very for much for the coffee and for your time. He held up the sandwich.And you cant beat tuna.

Youre youre welcome, Christopher said.I must have something here somewhere, to repay you for your kindness. It was the mans turn to dig in his coat pockets.He pulled out a bunch of tissues, folded cards, and at the front of them all, a train ticket.Ah-ha!"He sounded triumphant."Here you go, these are for you, he said, holding them out."You've earned them."Christopher tried to suppress a grin.The destination and date on the ticket had been scratched out, but it was faded and had clearly been used already.Thats very kind of you, but theres no need.

I insist.

Again, theres no need, he said firmly, as he got up and walked over to Violette.Violette looked away from her phone.Are you done with your new friend already? Her voice was clipped and her smile was gone again.Im sorry.Its just, he didnt seem to be doing so good.And like you said, its a cold night.

Violette frowned.Ah, youre a nice person, Christopher.But maybe *too* nice.

If you think Im nice, its only because you dont know me very well.Not yet, anyway. He took her hand.How about we get some food now?

Yes please, said Violette.I think Im in the mood for Italian.

I think Id like French.

Smooth Christopher, came the voice again.A shiver skated down his spine.It really was cold tonight.He slipped his free hand into his coat pocket, burrowing down for warmth.His brow creased as his fingers brushed over something the shape of a credit card in a pocket he could have sworn was empty.Christopher pulled out the train ticket and stared at it.What is it? Violette said, seeing his expression.Oh nothing, he replied, hiding the puzzlement on his face and thrusting the ticket back into his coat.Nothing at all.
