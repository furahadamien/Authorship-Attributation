Blood flowed down my temple in a river, its source a cut hidden beneath a thick tangle of hair.Slowly it traveled down, pooling in little eddies created by the scraggly beard until it finally dripped from my chin.My breath came in ragged heaves, my body desperate for oxygen after the exertions that had led me to this door.The door that held my future.I staggered forward a step, my heart pounding in my chest.I tried to will myself to calmness.to craft my countenance into the image that all princesses must picture in moments like these.I was worn by the obstacles set before this door.A boundary few had crossed.A keep inhabited by oathbound enemies.A malevolent king who had taken her hostage.Each had been conquered so that I might stand here.I was a hero.So why did I feel so small?So vulnerable?I raised a gauntleted hand to the reinforced steel door and dropped my hand against it.A thundering clunk rang out, echoing throughout the dread keep.Were there any left to oppose me, they surely would have harkened to the noise.But they were gone and I was here.Ready to revive a love lost to me, stolen away so many years ago when I was young and weak.After the sound faded, I heard a rustling sound, though it was muffled by the thick steel between us.I leaned forward, straining to hear, only to stumble a step back when a thudding clunk from the other side came out."Hello?"A fluttering, lilting voice asked.I wish I could say I recognized it as the princess immediately, but time stretched long since I had last heard it.Still, who else could it be?Tears came to my eyes, clouding my vision and my heart broke.She was here.All of this time since she had been stolen by the Traitor King.I had taken a revenge two decades in the planning, and even now the crown glittered from its spot upon my belt."Princess Sorra, it is me, I have come at last," I called out, mustering what courage I could."The Traitor King is dead, and I have come to return you home."Silence."Princess?"A sound of shuffling."She will be here shortly," the voice replied.I blinked at the door, trying to piece the mystery unfolding behind it together.Who was this other person, why was she there?Was she a threat?Were my efforts in vain?I opened my mouth again, ready to demand answers when a new voice joined."Who is this?"The voice unlocked something within me.Even through the clutter and haze of days past, it revived the whispers and giggles of the girl I had known."Knight Trast," I paused to swallow, "It's me Sorra.It's Daven."She did not answer immediately, though I could hear the soft murmur of voices.I felt my anticipation building, the desire to remove the barrier between us growing irresistible, "May I come in?"I rested my gauntlet on the bar across the entrance."Yes, Knight Trast," a small silence, "...Daven.You may."I pulled the bar to the left, causing it to emit a small grinding sound as various gears interacted with each other to release the locking mechanism.After it had stopped, I pulled on the handle and opened the door.A soft glow appeared, lighting the hallway I stood in as I opened the door.My eyes adjusted quickly, and then fell upon the two women who stood on the other side.They stood close to each other, with one of their hands fiercely gripping the hand of the other, the fingers interlaced.I looked at the first woman, my eyes quickly appraising her soft curves and light brown hair before deciding she was not who I sought.Then I beheld the other woman.Strands of delicately spun gold were arranged into a neat plait that had then been circled atop her head, creating a halo of hair.Luminous blue eyes looked back at me, nervous and unsure.I fell to my knees in a great clatter of armor, my head hanging, "Princess Sorra, I did not believe it.Did not dare to hope."I shuddered, the emotions swirling within me.The joy at having found her.The shame at having lost her.The rage at the time we had lost.But most of all, rising above the rest: the love.Suddenly, I felt a hand on my head, delicate and light.It simply rested atop the matted hair, timid but reassuring.I mustered the strength to look up at her, "I swore to bring you home.I am sorry it has taken me so long."She took a step back, casting a nervous glance to the woman beside her."I am thankful for your effort Knight Trast, the time here has been..." she took a step toward the other woman, "complicated."I furrowed my brow, confused."I imagine it has been quite horrible, Princess.I cannot imagine what the Traitor King has inflicted upon you.""There has been terror."Her hand found the other woman's, though her eyes did not leave mine."And joy."**PART 2**

====

"Joy?"It made no sense.She had been stolen from her home, made to live beneath the iron rule of the Traitor King, how could her life have held anything but misery?I had hoped for a different reception.A long moment passed as I stared at those hands clutching at each other, knuckles white."Sorra, Who is this woman?"Sorra straightened, her shoulders drawing back and chin raising slightly, "This is Princess Lowa, daughter of the King of Barramuir."Sorra inched closer toward Lowa, casting a sidelong glance at her before continuing."She has been my companion."Barramuir.The lands bordering the Traitor King's domain to the East.We had had few dealings with them since the Great Betrayal.It appeared the Traitor King had not reserved his treachery solely for Sorra's home.Not a surprising development, but their presence together seemed odd.Perhaps it did not matter.It simply meant that two lands would rejoice at today's developments.I nodded to Lowa, "Princess Lowa, I am glad you are safe and have comforted Princess Sorra.I will ensure you are returned safely to your home."Sorra shook her head once, "No, we're not going back."I paused."We?"Sorra inched closer to Lowa."We."I pulled myself up from my knees, joints cracking and muscles screaming for respite.I took a step toward them, and they sidled back in unison, keeping distance."Sorra, your father has sacrificed so much to regain you."I took a breath, "I have too.There has been a hole in Verradia without you."I reached out a hand plaintively, "You must return.News of the Traitor King's death will spread.Your father's army even now moves through the halls below."Lowa turned to Sorra, "They will never accept it.Accept us."I was growing frustrated, my voice raising."You are their daughters.Both lands will welcome you with open arms.I will ensure Princess Lowa is escorted there safely."Sorra bit her lower lip, the pearlescent teeth grinding slowly at the soft flesh.Just as she had done when had gone too far in our adventuring or broke the rules.She was nervous.Scared.I dropped my voice, trying to soothe her, "I promise she will be safe."Her eyes flashed and her arm raised, the fingers splaying out as she gestured to the room around her."Safe?"She relinquished her hold on Lowa's hand as she approached me, the muscles of her throat straining as she jutted her chin out."We have not been safe for years."She began to pace back and forth in the space between me and Lowa."Years we have been here, stuck in this room.Made to be his," she spit the last word out, "toys."Lowa paled, but she simply watched as Sorra continued."We had nothing but each other.No one came for us.No one protected us.No one made us safe."She turned and looked at me, "I do not need to be safe.I do not need to go home, because that place does not mean anything to me anymore.I have been forced to make my own home.To craft my own safety."She returned to Lowa's side, "There is only one place either of us can be safe, and that is together."I tried to understand what they had been through, but I could not.While I had trained, she had been forced to endure.The Traitor King was dead, but his legacy lingered in the haunted look in both women's eyes.She had survived, and I could not blame them for finding solace in the presence of the other.My tone became more gentle, the rough gravel of my voice smoothing some."I am thankful to Princess Lowa for all she has done to protect and care for you, but she need not protect you any longer.The journey to this room has been so long Sorra, but you no longer have to worry of the Traitor King.""You do not understand," Lowa said."Then make me.I am here to return the Princess, I have been charged and sworn with this sacred duty."I exhaled sharply, "And I am here to embrace the woman I love."I dared not look at Sorra.I had been young and foolish, a lower born boy aspiring to heights I could never reach, but we had had the connection between us.It had been more than friendship, hadn't it?"It is simple," Lowa replied, a certain pity reaching her eyes.She turned toward Sorra, her arms sliding up around Sorra's waist and enfolding her.Sorra flushed, the red running into her cheeks as her lips parted slightly.Lowa smiled at her, "I love you," she whispered.Then she leaned in, pressing her lips against Sorra's as her arms drew Sorra close.Sorra pressed into her, letting her honey-gold head tilt and be guided by the subtle cues of Lowa's body language.Finally, their lips parted, though Sorra kept close, whispering, "I love you too."She gave Lowa a quick peck and then stepped back.I could only watch, devastated.The life I had built for myself crumbling before me.A great overwhelming sorrow swirled within me and I felt the desire to scream.I tried to rationalize.They were just confused.This was temporary.This was because of their circumstances.But I knew.Lowa looked at Sorra as I once had.She saw Sorra for the treasure she was.I understood.I hated it.Hated myself.But I understood.I reached up and slowly unbuckled the fasteners that held my gauntlets in place.They clattered to the ground, causing Sorra to jump back from Lowa, startled.Sorra turned to look at me, a quiet defiance in her features that softened only when she saw the misery in mine."How long?"I asked, unsure what else to say."A long time," Sorra replied.I nodded, "You cannot part.""We cannot," Lowa said."And you cannot be accepted," I continued."We cannot," Lowa confirmed."Then what shall you do?"I asked, "This world is...difficult.It is not," I searched for a word, "hospitable to things it does not understand."In the conservative lands of Verradia, they would be put to the stake.Sorra's father dealt less in extremes, but it would never be permitted.Lowa sighed, the veneer of strength collapsing."We do not know.We never expected this day to come."I nodded.My hands raised up to my face, and I massaged my eyes as I considered what to do.I could barely stand, but I knew time was short.I had been afforded the privilege of reaching this room first as the commander, but it would last only so long.The weight of my oath to the king settled heavily on my shoulders.I swore to find her.Protect her.Return her.I had found her, but how would I protect her?How could I keep my oath if protecting her meant I could not return her?I turned it over in my head, trying to find reason amongst the confusion.Then I stopped, my hands dropping and I looked at them."I swore an oath before coming here," I said."To find you.To protect you.To return you."Lowa took a step forward, pulling Sorra behind her, "We have already--"

I raised a hand, cutting her off, "I must keep my oath, but I believe I can do so without separating you."Lowa looked at me, waiting for an explanation, while Sora peeked her eyes above Lowa's shoulder.I met them with mine."I have found you.Protecting you is more complicated.I understand your situation, and, while it is not what I hoped for...I am content in knowing that you are alive and well.I know that you cannot be well if you are separated from Lowa."Both nodded fiercely, Sorra returning to biting on her lip."So I will kidnap each of you.We will flee South, to Clastrum and beyond.You will be together, at least in private, and we will make a home in a quiet place.""You would do this?"Sorra asked, wonder in her face."For many years I have lived a life.It was not a life I desired because you were not in it, but it was not what you have endured.Now there is an opportunity for a life with you beside me, though not in the manner I hoped for."I shrugged, "It is better than nothing.It is better than breaking your heart.It is better than forsaking my oath and not protecting you."Sorra's eyes watered, though Lowa remained steel."But what of the final part of your oath?What of the return?""I did not say when.Only that I would protect her until she was returned," I replied."But she will never return," Lowa said.I shrugged, "She said she would not be parted from you, and I cannot part you, but every life has an end.When the end comes, I return her ashes to the land of her father."Lowa blinked, "What if you die first?""A death in service of an oath is a fine death," I replied."Why?"Lowa asked, the steel finally fading from her face.I shrugged, "I love her."Lowa nodded, "And you cannot be parted.""I cannot."**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

**You may find the beginning of the story**  **(which I have cleaned up and added to).I have left a comment attached to this thread detailing my plans for the story.**

"Griggs, you're telling me a whole lot of things I know and not a lot of things I don't know," Admiral Levinson placed his hands flat on the steel conference table separating him from his science officer.He leaned forward, looming over Officer Griggs, "You're here to answer questions, not leave me with them."Griggs was a good man, but he was here to explain the unexplainable, not explain why he could not explain it.The two junior science personnel flanking Griggs sat like carved stones in their chairs, looking straight ahead at the bulkhead rather than dare a glance at Levinson.Neither had spoken a word since arriving in the conference room.Jack Griggs was unfazed.He'd learned to not take things personally when it came to Levinson a long time ago."Admiral, the phenomenon is entirely unanticipated and has no clear analog in our known science.We conducted extensive tests on the Alcubierre drive within local space, each time reaching a maximum speed of 4.23c.Any attempt to exceed 4.23c was limited by our onboard capacity to generate negative mass."Levinson straightened up and turned away so he could pace in the narrow area beside the table."Did we somehow generate more negative mass?"Griggs shook his head."Is negative mass more...I don't know, powerful now?"Griggs paused, considering the question."How do you mean, more powerful?"Levinson whirled on his heel, a pulsing vein popping out on his forehead, "How the hell should I know Griggs?"He slammed his fist against the thick slab of adamantine steel of the wall beside him, "I'm just making it up as I go along here."He withdrew his fist, putting it behind his back, trying to find his calm.Griggs simply gawked.Not at Levinson, but at the wall the admiral had just struck.Levinson followed his gaze, turning to look as well.There, in the center of the unbreakable metal, was dent.\---

The Zix Collective rarely attempted contact with the other species comprising the Pan-Universia Combine.A species level interaction required a species wide consensus, which required substantial expenditure of resources and time.Each sub-float would be required to meld with the main-float and offer their contribution.The issues of Left-Right consensus were magnified considerably when caste-hierarchies and purpose-specializations were added to the equation.Indeed, in the seven hundred and thirty four thousand years the Zix Collective had been a member of the Pan-Universia Combine, a species consensus had only been attempted twenty-six times.It had only been achieved three times.Less consuming methods, such as the vulgarity of isolated encounters of singletons preferred by some other species, was viewed with universal horror by Lefts and Rights alike.There had been a point when it had been considered by a Right within a single social research sub-float, but the concept had died a quick death beneath the withering scrutiny of a sensible Left and not reconsidered.Xy found it disconcerting that it would be placed at the center of the twenty-seventh Zix-moot.It was a Self First, perhaps the most notable in Xy's existence.The ensuing first cascade was dizzying, making the Left long for the quiet of its sub-tank.Zyy seemed quite pleased with the developments, its cilia waving to and fro in the most flagrant disregard for propriety.That was the way of Rights, quick to embrace the whimsy of the universe, leaving the hard work of reality to sensible Lefts.Xy briefly mulled over a particularly sacrilegious concept of a two Left tank before discarding it as the sort of nonsense a Right might dwell on.Xy floated next to Zyy, letting its cilia brush the Right just enough to establish a thought thread.Zyy's awareness trickled in, muted by the limited connection.Zyy was preoccupied with the question of how to reach the Sol Object.Of course, Zyy was observation specialized, just as Xy was, so no solutions presented themselves.Despite the foolishness of it all, Xy let itself be carried along by the fancy for a moment, sharing in Zyy excitement of tracking down the originator of a Universal First.What would it be?This manufactured object that cared not for the norms of the universe?Zyy tentatively reached out with more cilia, seeking a deeper connection.A thought thread was insufficient, particularly not for the gravity of the moment.Xy considered and then accepted, viewing it as a kindness.Xy was not quite ready to admit to itself that it shared the Right's nervousness.They went back and forth, letting their thoughts guide themselves as they awaited the time for the Zix-moot.The conversation was superficial, both unwilling to directly address the questions that bedeviled them both.Would the Zix contact the Combine?What then?\---

A few short hours later, Science Officer Griggs commenced his second report of the day, this time armed with considerably more information."Admiral, simply put, the rules have changed."Griggs pointed to the dented wall behind the assembled executive leadership of the *UWS Alcubierre*."Namely, the laws of the universe we considered immutable and, well, universal, are not."There was an exchange of glances, but each member of the crew kept their own counsel, waiting for him to proceed.Griggs tapped through a few screens and the lights dimmed.In the center of the room, hanging over the table was a glowing representation of the solar system."I stated before that we had done extensive testing on the Alcubierre drive in *local* space."Suddenly, thousands of small lines appeared, creating a dense spiderweb throughout the solar system."Each of these represents a separate flight test.You will notice that each of these tests were within thirty thousand astronomical units of the sun."A transparent blue globe appeared, with the sun at its center.Each of the flight paths were neatly encompassed within."This glove represents a half light year distance from the sun, approximately thirty-one thousand astronomical units."His fingers danced along the input console again, and a new searing yellow dot appeared, blinking periodically."This is the *UWS Alcubierre*, and this," he paused to enter another command, "is its flight path."The dot moved, leaving a yellow trail behind it.It approached the half-light year globe and, once it passed through it, turned red, "The red demarcates where we experienced the speed increase.It occurred approximately seventy-four days into our journey, at the exact moment we passed the half-light year boundary."There was silence for a moment.Admiral Levinson cleared his throat, but his eyes did not leave the blinking red dot, "What are you saying Jack?"Jack's eyes took a breath, gathering his nerves, "Admiral, I'm saying that when we passed that boundary, the laws of physics changed.For the entirety of human history, the relationship between energy and force was the same.A certain amount of energy would generate a certain amount of force, barring intervening variables like friction."He stood and walked over to the wall, rubbing his fingers across the dent."Once we passed through the boundary, that relationship changed.It takes considerably less energy to generate considerably more force.""So why aren't we punching holes through things?Why didn't I jab my toothbrush through my head this morning?"Levinson asked, letting his gruff tone distract the crew from the gravity of the situation."Oddly enough, it is isn't a linear relationship, which is also wildly at odds with our understanding of things.There appears to be an exponential relationship between energy and force, but we have not teased out the equations yet.My entire staff is on it.""Use smaller words Jack."Levinson replied."Admiral, a handshake is still a handshake, but a punch can level a mountain."Griggs replied, knocking his fist slightly on the dented wall beside him."I see," Levinson took a deep breath, "and what would our mass drivers do?""Unimaginable destruction."[**You can find Part 3 HERE.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerilousPlatypus/comments/9ye20d/story_continuation_the_uws_alcubierre_part_3/)

"First, we mastered the pull of the Earth, forcing our way into space.Those first efforts were nervous.Timid.We were small, and the frontier of the blackness beyond loomed large in our minds," Secretary General Venruss took a deep breath, letting a pregnant silence settle upon the billions of viewers."We escaped our backyard, laying claim to the moon."His hand swept wide, and the camera pulled out to show the gleaming Earth, that glorious ball of blue, white and green, over the horizon of the lunar landscape."Then we ventured to the planets beyond."The background shimmered and then shifted, showing a glittering city beneath a red sky with a blinking blue dot in the distance.Another breath."Today, we leave the neighborhood."Again the backdrop behind the Secretary shimmered and shifted, now forming into an enormous grey ship, its exterior all sharp angles.Emblazoned on the side was *UWS Alcubierre* in bold white lettering.Secretary General Venruss was relegated to a small picture within a picture as Fleet Admiral Levinson appeared in the main view.He stood tall, his broad chin making for a stern profile.Steely blue eyes peered out beneath two bushy eyebrows, making him the very picture of a lifelong military man.The honor of leadership had fallen to him, a much sought after prize, earned only through his long history of distinguished service in the United World Defense Force."Thank you Secretary, it is my very great pleasure to lead our fleet to the stars beyond.Humanity has always measured its progress by the forces it has tamed to its ends.First the horse, then steam, then combustion.Now, we unleash the power of space-time itself.Sir, the *UWS Alcubierre* awaits your orders."The screens swapped, placing the Secretary in the fore, "Very well Admiral, you are hereby ordered to Alpha Centauri to scout and conduct scientific experiments.All of humanity stands behind you."Admiral Levinson snapped a neat salute and turned from the camera, issuing the order to launch.There was a scramble of activity as the members of the bridge hurried about their pre-launch tasks.A narrator explained the various procedures and roles and responsibilities of the various crew members as humanity watched in breathless anticipation.A few minutes later, Adrmiral Levinson turned back to the camera, snapped a final salute and barked out a single word: "Engage."Then he was gone.\---

*ANOMALY ALERT - Project Sol, Interstellar Date 2310.393.123.*

*Trigger: Perimeter Breach.Interstellar Object.*

*Speed:  78.3 Lights and accelerating.*

*Object Origin: Sol.*

*Object Specifications: Manufactured.*

*Detailed Anomaly Alert Report available.*

Xy Zix, Left Float Superior studied the report, its cilia twitching in agitation.It contained many firsts, each more concerning than the last.The first anomaly report from Project Sol.The first object to originate from Sol.The first object to breach the ten light barrier.Xy was not opposed to firsts, but, by their very nature, they were somewhat unusual.It took a moment to ponder if firsts must necessarily be clustered together in such a manner.It suspected they must be.One first cascading into others.It wondered how far the ripple of a first might be carried before it was swallowed up by the nature of the vast universe.Could a single first fundamentally reorient existence?Such a first would be a first indeed.Perhaps even a last.Xy combed through the report, following the standard procedures.Lefts of the Zix Collective was innately skeptical of firsts, particularly ones such as this.In a great many cases, such a first was actually just the first sign of a failing instrument.Measurements could be incorrect, and more often than not were when it came to matters such as these.That was the importance of procedures.They allowed for the safe extinguishment of common explanations in an orderly manner, providing room for the exotic.As Xy proceeded through the standard responses, the veneer of normalcy was slowly stripped away.Initial indications were that the recording instruments were operating within ideal parameters.Secondary indications confirmed that initial indications appeared to be correct.Tertiary indications supplied a degree of certainty that prompted a simple conclusion.This required escalation.Xy floated toward Zyy, its float tank companion.Their cilia intertwined and Xy relayed the report and its initial findings.Zyy shared Xy's initial consternation, though its curiosity was immediately piqued in a way Xy considered slightly profane.But that was the way with Right Floats, they were somewhat prone to fancy in a way that Left Floats such as Xy were not.It was part of the science in selecting float tank companions -- compatible and incompatible all at once.It ensured that they would agree only on the matters of the greatest import.In this case, there was little debate before consensus was achieved.The Sol Anamoly was worth immediate and serious study.They would pass on their findings from their sub-tank to main tank.\---

"Sir, something is...it appears we're having a malfunction."The young helmsman said, her voice uneven."Specifics Lieutenant Lee, I do not like the word malfunction without a damn good explanation to go along with it."Admiral Levinson said from behind in the fleet chair, his gravelly voice calm and commanding."Yes sir, sorry sir.It's our speed.We're going too fast.""Too fast Lieutenant?We expected some variance from the Alcubierre, are we outside the expected range?How fast are we going?"Admiral considered it a stroke of good luck, not cause for alarm.Perhaps they'd hit Centauri earlier than expected.It was to be a long journey, and he was quite eager to gain a few steps."Yes sir, well outside the range."Her fingers flew across the console, flicking between various readouts."Well, put it up on the screen."Levinson waved his hand toward the front of the bridge.Lee pressed a few buttons and then the helmsman's con flicked into view.It showed the current heading, the engine status, and a variety of other pieces of information, including the speed.Admiral Levinson jolted forward, "That can't be right."They were moving at almost 100 times the speed of light, well beyond their expected range of two to three."Report."Lee ducked her head, "Sir, I pulled up our trip log and graphed out our speed and location."She highlighted a portion where their speed suddenly increased thirty fold."At approximately a half light year from our solar system our speed jumped by 31.3x, for reasons I cannot explain.This conclusion is supported by the cartography readings.""What in the hell is going on here?"The Admiral's head jerked to the side, his hand flicking up and pointing to a wizened officer in the corner."Science Officer Griggs, pull the logs.I want everything you can give me and I want a report on it within the hour.Take whomever you need."\---

The main float was abuzz as the Zix Collective attempted to reach consensus.Lessers mingled with Superiors.Superiors with Grands.It was a confused jumble of cilia, each jostling for the latest news.Xy and Zyy were swarmed from all sides, their cilia being subjected to interrogation bordering on hostile.Many of the Lefts refused to believe that there could be an explanation beyond instrumentation error.The Rights were positively gleeful at the prospect of such an extraordinary first.It had been been some time since a Universal First had been achieved.Each of the Rights felt fortunate to be in existence for such a momentous occasion.Information about the Sol Project was still lacking.The experiment predated the Zix Collective's time.Reference to it was available only via the Archive Pan-Universia.Study into the matter had revealed the nature of the project and the originator.The originator had been the Divinity Angelysia, a Type Three civilization that had since transcended.They had been somewhat notorious for their efforts around sentient creation and were responsible for no less than two dozen species within the Pan-Universia Combine.Interestingly, the subject of the experimentation had been environmental hostility.The sentients had been gifted with great creativity, but they were highly constrained by physical laws within the local region.A great number of Rights were approaching consensus that such parameters may well give birth to a Universal First.The Universe was quite hospitable in comparison, and few species felt any particular pressure to innovate such things as a 100x Light Drive.The Lefts maintained their skepticism, but agreed that the object referenced in the Sol Anomaly report should be investigated, if only to prove the Rights' foolishness.Consensus was achieved.The Zix collective would seek out this object, once they determined how to catch it.[**You can continue the story in Part 2 found here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerilousPlatypus/comments/9wxnvo/story_continuation_the_uws_alcubierre_part_2/)

Frontiersman Lucian Xan's blood flowed freely down his brow until it met his jawline.It pooled on the tip of his chin and then dripped downward, unnoticed and unimportant."How many are we looking at?I'm getting nothing but squid on the local."Jack Studde snorted, "More than it's worth countin'."He gave a hapless shrug, "Only so many bullets to fire sometimes Luke.We've done what we could."Xan's eyes watered as the smoke from the fire began to cloud the cockpit, causing the viewscreen to blur.The red blinking notification was clear enough."We didn't get a clear line.The message isn't getting out.""They'll know well enough when the *Hermes* doesn't report in.Sometimes shooting the messenger is message enough."Jack yanked on the release to his harness, letting some of the pressure off of his chest.Just above his breast was a small winged sandal with the name Studde emblazoned above it."Wish we'd brought bigger guns.They say the new models got grav pulses."Lucian sighed, "Yeah, well, it was supposed to be quiet out this way.Squids are supposed to be a few hundred AU the other direction."He slammed the heel of his hand on the panel in front of him, willing the engine back to life.They were dead in the black, their ion drive knocked offline.The squids would have them tractored in soon enough.They needed a bit of luck, that or the grace of God.Xan pulled up the comms relay, funneling in the last bit of power in a vain hope of getting the message out.*Thor* was only a hop and a skip behind them, close enough to make it before the air ran out in their suits.The warship had been pulverizing everything in its path, its mass drivers inexplicably performing beyond specifications on multiple occasions.His fingers flew across the panel, the spiderweb of cracks ignored as he attempted to call out.The last bit of power trickled down, the lights dimming in the ship."Auxiliaries almost gone," Jack called out.Lucian ignored him, his attention focused on the little red blinking notification on relay readout."C'mon you god damned--"

A small flare appeared, the readout flickering for the briefest of moments to show a pair of winged sandals.The red notification blinked out and re-appeared, a cool minty green."Sonuvabitch..." Xan yelled out."It's out!"The lights blinked out, shrouding the ship in darkness."What?"Jack asked, the flexglass helmet stored in his collar unfurling and sheathing his head.A small 100% number appeared on his shoulder, indicating his oxygen supply."The relay, it got the message out.*Thor* should have it in a few minutes."Lucian frowned down at the local, "Probably not enough time to save our asses, but at least home has a warning that they've got squids pounding down their back door."\---

"Captain, we've got a priority inbound from the edge.*Frontiership Hermes.* Distress."The comms officer swore, "We've got squids, Ma'am.Whole fleet of them.*Hermes* is disabled.""Stow it and keep focused Lieutenant.Send a relay back earthward and let's get them some backup," Captain Lawless commanded, her steely grey eyes darting between the bridge crew."Captain, we don't know what we're up against, the message just said a fleet of squids."Comms Officer Lucas replied even as he prepared the relay message back home."Let me worry about that Lucas, just get us there."She sat in her command chair, her shoulders squared forward, the golden lightning bolt emblazoned on her chest twinkling in the light."This is the *Thor*, we've got the hammer."\---

Frontiersmen Xan and Studde drifted in the black abyss, the oxygen numbers on their shoulders slowly ticking down.They did not speak, each word would simply be a wasted breath, something neither could afford.Xan's number was slightly lower than Studde's, largely on account of the difference in their size.Xan also sweated a bit more, elevating his heart rate and generally causing him to burn up what little precious time he had left.But there was hope.Somewhere in the deep space was the *Thor*.All they needed to do was survive long enough to see it.Not that they would know when it arrived, the viewscreen was dark along with the rest of the ship, the final spurt of energy used to launch the message that might save them.After a few minutes, there was a pressure on their backs, pressing them against their seats.They shared a glance, each knowing the truth of it: the squids had arrived to claim their prize.They were being tractored.Xan glanced down at his oxygen patch.Fifty-seven percent.Over an hour if he didn't do anything drastic.Not that it mattered, their orders were clear enough.Under no circumstances were they permitted to be captured alive.The squids made a habit of trying to disarm and imprison.Initially, it was treated like any other prisoner-of-war situation, even with the wrinkle that they were aliens.We took some of theirs.They took some of ours.We did not make that mistake anymore.They took more than prisoners.They drained them.Knowledge.Emotion.Humanity.A fate worse than death.So they came prepared.Everyone who slapped a sigil on their chest and flew for Earth knew what the stakes were.Xan and Studde would simply be the next to do their duty.Xan didn't feel any anger over it.No rage.They had fought and lost.Xan would die a warrior in service of his home, and others will pick up where they left off.His only regret was the dead ion drive.He had hoped to make a bit of a bang as he shuffled off the mortal coil, but it wasn't in the cards.Xan turned to look at Studde, "Win some lose some, right Jack?"Jack heaved a great exhale, his breath temporarily fogging up his helmet."You don't want to wait 'til they open up the can?"Xan wagged his head in the negative, "Best make a clean go of it.Neither of us wants to get hollowed out."Jack sighed, "Damn shame.""We got the message out.The *Hermes* did what he needed to do."Xan paused as the tractoring stopped."Looks like it's the end of the road.It's been an honor Jack."Xan unholstered his sidearm and began to raise it up, his finger moving to curl around the trigger.An explosion.\---

"We're at thirty-eight contacts local.One faint blinker on distress, the rest are all calamari," Comms Offcier Lucas called out, sliding his viewpanel readout to the main screen."Looks like the *Hermes* has its wings clipped.They've got them on tractor."Captain Lawless took in the information and then began to bark out orders."Helmsman, plot an intercept course with the *Hermes*, I want us up their ass.We'll get out and push if we have to.*"*

"That'll take us into the swarm Captain--" Lucas began."I'm capable of reading a nav chart Lucas.Just keep me up to date on where the tractor is at.Have they reacted to us yet?"The captain cut in."No Ma'am, they're holding tight around the *Hermes,*" Lucas replied."There's a bit of luck."She glanced to the side, "Gunnery, let's drop the hammer.First volley on the tractor, second on the command ship if you can pick it out."Gunnery Jacobsen nodded, "On it Captain."He pulled the nav data from the helmsman and supplemented it with a firing solution.Almost immediately the ship's lights dimmed slightly as power was drawn toward the mass drivers running along the length of the ship.There was a muffled *CHONK* sound as the first shots were released.The lights brightened momentarily and then the process was repeated."Hammer away."Captain Lawless just hoped their luck continued to hold.*Thor* was behind the times, which was how it ended up posted in the astral equivalent of the hinterland.The newest squids had managed to reinforce their hulls against mass drivers, forcing humanity into a nerve-wracking arms race.Grav pulses ruled the stars now, but *Thor* hadn't had the chance to retrofit.Still, somehow the hammer always seemed to pull through.Defying math and logic.It didn't matter now, there weren't any other options.One warship against a fleet was already suicide, what did it matter whether the hammer worked?She was risking it all for two Frontiersmen without enough sense to not get caught.Xan was going to owe her a long night of drinking after this.The good stuff.Cheap asshole that he was might prefer death.A wisp of a smile came to her lips."First hit!"Jacobsen called out."How'd we do?"Captain Lawless asked.Jacobsen turned in his chair to look back at his Captain, a large grin on his face."Hammer still knows how to smash."Lawless pumped her fist once in victory, "Looks like we're in the fight."A small arc of electricity sparked from her lightning sigil to the bolts emblazoned on her command chair."Let's ride the thunder."Cheers broke out.**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

Xy returned to its sub-float, worn and exhausted from the frenzy of the Zix Moot.Even Zyy was worse for wear, it floated quietly on the far side of the tank its cilia drooping and lifeless.Both were observation purpose-specializations, making neither particularly well suited for the rigors main-tank life, to say nothing of the demands a Moot placed upon to participants.Xy would be quite content to never leave its sub-float for the remainder of its existence, though the conclusion of the Zix Moot made that quite impossible.Consensus had been achieved.For the first time in over one hundred thousand years, the Zix Collective would make contact with the Pan-Universia Combine.It had been a rare moment of unity amongst the Zix, with all of the carefully tended dividers within the species -- left/right, purpose-specialization, caste-hierarchy -- being bridged almost immediately.Never before had an agreement been reached so quickly.Nor was there precedent for the depth of alignment.Indeed, the Zix spoke with almost one voice on the matter, with very few of the typical disagreement addenda commonplace to any macro consensus.A diplomatic mission to Halcyon, the bureaucratic seat of Pan-Universia, would be sent, carrying word of the Universal First.The confluence of events was simply too great to ignore.A Universal First was, naturally, cause for excitement, even among the most sober of Lefts, but the nature of the First was of particular interest.It was quite unimaginable that the ten light barrier might be breached, and even more unfathomable by such an extent.Any sensible species would elect for wormhole bores before attempting such insanity.It was immediately classified as a Category Zero First, an exceedingly rare appellation reserved only for Firsts with the potential to create a Universal Last.The entire matter was complicated by the involvement of the Divinity Angelysia, the long absent progenitors of substantial wonders and chaos across the universe.Zix records indicated that the Divinity Angelysia's experiments had generated no less than thirteen Category Zero's, eight of which had resulted in fantastic destruction before they were brought under control.That Project Sol had been entirely silent before generating such float-boiling First was only more cause for concern.Xy quite agreed with all of these conclusions, and had welcomed the consensus on these points.It had only entered into disagreement with respect to the requirement that it must accompany the diplomatic mission to Halcyon.It had stopped short of entering a disagreement addendum on the matter, but a decidedly non-Left portion of it had wanted to.Zyy floated near, a single cilia reaching out to establish a though thread.Despite the desire for isolation, Xy accepted.Zyy was torn.The thirst for adventure endemic to Rights warred with the desire for peace and quiet observation purpose-specializations naturally sought.Xy shared its own worries and concerns, which only increased as their sub-float groaned as it was disentangled from the main-float.The liquid inside shifted and swirled as the thrust created a temporary gravity, a disconcerting experience for both Xy and Zyy.The wormhole awaited.Soon, they would be in Halcyon.\---

Admiral Levinson mulled over Grigg's assessment, flexing his hand and letting his eyes casually settle on the dent in the adamantine steel."Any idea why my hand isn't broken in a million pieces?"Jack Griggs nodded, "It looks like the acting object does not receive equal reactive force.Essentially, there's an addendum to the law of intertia: an object in motion tends to stay in motion a*nd utterly obliterate the object at rest*.""Very colorful Jack.Well, let's just hope we're the ones doing the punching out here.""Yes Sir, I suggest we run a diagnost--" Jack was cut off and was thrown to the ground as the *UWS Alcubierre* groaned and then lurched to the side.Admiral Levinson found his feet first, "Red Alert!All crew to stations!"he called out, already charging out of the conference room and into the adjoining bridge.The lights of bridge shifted to a glowing crimson as warning notifications populated the consoles across the command pods."What's the status Lee?"Griggs and his subordinates clambered out after, making their way to the science pod.Lee's fingers were flying across the console, navigating through the warning signs as she gathered up as much information as she could muster."Sir, we're losing the bubble, I'm getting multiple Oranges coming up on engine sensors."Lee replied, managing a steady tone amidst the chaos."Bridge to engineering."A beep sounded, indicating that the line had been opened."What the hell is going on down there Benson?It's lighting up like Christmas up here."Levinson asked, his teeth gritting as the *Alcubierre* jolted to the side again."Looking into it Admiral.Initial reports show we've got a fracture on Containment-C, looks like the pulse injector shot right through the damn thing."There was a series of curse words as the ship groaned and then slammed the crew in a new direction."Going to lose the bubble if we can't get it back up."Admiral Levinson furrowed his brow, "Shot through?The containment cells are rated for fifty times tolerance--"

"Sir, they're energy to force based."Science Officer Griggs cut in, his face grim."Right now they're hitting outside the tolerance, pulverizing the drive.We need to drop the bubble now."Lieutenant Lee turned and looked back at Griggs, her face aghast.Levinson did not blame her, dropping the bubble without decelerating first was a death wish.The bubble placed them outside of normal space-time, protecting them from the sort of interactions that might prove fatal.Namely collisions.A single space pebble and the *UWS Alcubierre* would be rubble strewn out across light years."Any other option Griggs?You know what popping it now will do."Griggs shook his head in the negative, "The entire engine was built around assumptions that don't hold true any more.We're lucky we got off with a single fracture, it could have just as easily been the ship being ripped apart.We keep the bubble, we're dead for sure."Levinson closed his eyes for a moment, looking for another way out.The pause was rewarded with another groan and a series of flashing alerts."All right, drop the bubble Lieutenant.Pull the forward blast shields up to maximum, and full reverse .Maybe we'll slow down before we get obliterated."Lee nodded, her face pale as she entered the commands.The viewport shifted from a dull grey haze to a haze of smeared lines, the light from stars distorted by their speed."How long until we're sub-c Lee?""At maximum QVT, two months, thirteen days, four hour--"

"I don't need the minutes Lieutenant," Levinson turned to look at Griggs, "So we've got seventy five days without the bubble protecting us?How bad is it looking?""Not bad at all Admiral.We're the object in motion."Griggs flashed a grin, "I just hope for the universe's sake nothing gets in our way."**Part Four may be found** **.**

"Overseer Verus, there is a Priority inbound from X-4831," Operator Tilenne made a series of intricate gestures, casting the information from his downloadable to hers.Her oculary slits fluttered, the hue shifting from the red of oversight to  knowledge consumption green.After a moment, the slits returned to the pulsing red, fixed on Tilenne, "Most interesting, it is confirmed?""Yes Overseer.The Zix break their long silence.Or some other entity has gained control over the wormkey."Tilenne replied.Verus frowned, considering Tilenne's conjecture.An operator was generally cautioned against supposition, but the circumstances were unusual enough to warrant some latitude.It seemed very unlikely that any other species would manage to obtain and then use the Zix wormkey, but enough time had passed since the last contact that radical changes may have occurred in the interregnum.Verus' eyes filtered toward blue as she spread her four hands in front of her, swiping them into a broad circle before punching the air in a staccato fashion."This is of sufficient importance the Premier Valast should be informed, I have also thought-cast the report to the broadest set of channels as we will be unable to mask these developments.We must exercise what control we can."The enigmatic Zix were the subject of much idle speculation and active research within Halycon.In each interaction, little had been gained.Their representatives would sporadically appear, issue a statement or make a single decision and then disappear.Attempts to engage their emissaries further had been unsuccessful.Attempts at isolated contact had been met with everything short of outright hostility.Given the apparent unwillingness or inability to communicate individually, some had posited that the Zix were actually a hive mind, one of the few on record.This theory was belief by the fact that in many cases their statements were accompanied by notes they labeled "Disagreement Addendum," which suggested a lack of the conformity hive minds typically exhibited.In any instance, the opportunity to interact with the most elusive member of the Pan-Universia Combine would be greatly anticipated.The Overseer would be expected to manage the situation accordingly.Overseer Verus waited, attuned to the thought-web pulsing through her mind, searching for a response from Premier Valast.Her original thought-cast had immediately provoked a rustling in the web, a great murmur as interested parties consumed the morsel of information and toyed at the meaning.Soon, a great cacophony arose as researchers, merchants, and bureaucrats clamored for more information.Annoyed, Verus isolated the thought-channel for Premier Valast's office, content to let the others complain until she had secured her orders.Finally, a response came."We will welcome them."Simple.Direct.The Premier preferred an economy of words, something Verus found unusual in a politician.Not unwelcome though.The command and its import clear, Overseer Verus turned back to Tilenne."Premier Valast's office will organize a welcoming party.Please ensure that X-4831 is clear of obstacles and they are not detained by interlopers."Tilenne ducked his head, "Yes, Overseer."\---

Xy and Zyy were in consensus: they did not like travel.The sensation of the wormhole was difficult to describe beyond the fact that it was miserable.As they traversed the pathway between here and there, the wormhole exerted itself upon their float, causing it to vibrate.The constant fluctuation in pressure wreaked havoc on the delicate membranes across their bodies, placing them both in a state of debilitating suffering.They huddled close together, seeking comfort in each other presence, though neither could find much solace.Even Zyy could not muster a Right's enthusiasm for novelty in the moment.There was simply nothing to like about the process.After a short period of time, though indeterminably long by Xy's standards, they made their exit from the wormhole and entered into the vicinity of Halycon.Data began to flood in as schematics from the last Zix envoy were compared to this one.Zyy managed to shake off the numbing pain of the journey first and did what observation-specialization's did best: consumed data on their surroundings.Xy elected to remain annoyed for a period longer, though it did peek in on Zyy's efforts via a single cilia.Even the most Left of Lefts could not resist the magnitude of the situation, though Xy made sure to be sensibly dour about it.Zyy flung out another cilia, creating an emotion-thread to accompany the thought-thread.It was quite rude to do so without a request, but Xy allowed itself to be carried along for the moment.It soon understood why Zyy felt compelled to share its excitement.The Pan-Universia Combine had expanded considerably since their last contact.When the Zix had been inducted and awarded a wormkey, they had been the four thousand, eight hundred and thirty first species.The Pan-Universia Combine now stood at over eighty-five thousand species.The associated races claimed millions of worlds spread across unfathomable distances.The wormhole network spread broader and deeper than anything Xy might have considered possible.Xy cast away propriety, layering in additional cilia to enhance the emotion-thread to a full meld, it wanted to experience the wonder of the moment through Zyy, if only for a brief period.Such marvelous progress.Xy wondered whether their news of a Universal First might already be stale.Or perhaps the odd species from Sol were already in contact with the Pan-Universia.It seemed unlikely, the Zix observed a hinterland in the galaxy, but all things felt possible in light of the Combine's scope.Shuddering, Xy pulled back a few cilia.Weeding out the Right thought was leeching into its own, corrupting it with silly fancy.Zyy registered some offense, upset that Xy did not share its enthusiasm, but such indignation was common between them.A Left and Right may share a tank, but they would never share a mind.Xy pulled the list of Universal Firsts.No mention of Sol.More importantly, no progress had been made against the ten lights barrier.Even with the considerable breadth of the Combine, none had managed it.In each case, progress was stymied, often for a combination of reasons: the superior efficiency of wormholes, the exponential threat of faster than light objects, the inability to develop force resistent material.The current record stood at 9.832 lights.Their mutual revery was put to an end when the float tank docked with the Halcyon way-station.The typical set of perfunctory greetings along with a series of requests from Premier Valast arrived shortly thereafter.Xy combed through the accompanying archives and assembled an accession chart, detailing the reign of various Premiers and their notable accomplishments since the Zix last arrived.Premier Valast was of Species X-14, the first outside of Species X-1 to be selected in thousands of years.This was an interesting development as X-14 was known for their somewhat aggressive posture toward non-members.Perhaps his selection was a reaction to the considerable expansion of the Pan-Universia.Change of this nature might provoke a shift in leadership preferences.Xy wished it had more time to make more sense of this, but the requests began to pile up.It seemed every denizen of Halycon wished an audience.Xy and Zyy sidelined all requests not issued from Premier Valast, dispensing with them quickly.The Zix Moot had achieved a narrow consensus and they were uninterested in becoming sidetracked from their obligations.Once they had established official, secure communication with the Premier's office directly, Xy and Zyy broadcast their message.*Communication Path: Zix Collective to Pan-Universia Combine*

*Species Identifier: X-4831*

*Consensus: Species*

*Purpose: Information transfer.*

*Plenipotentiaries: Xy, Left Float Superior.Zyy, Right Float Superior*

*Consensus Content: On Interstellar Date 2310.393.123, the Zix Collective observed a Universal First.The initial observers, Xy and Zyy, have been dispatched as Plenipotentiaries on behalf of the Zix.Instrumentation deployed along Spiral Scutum recorded a manufactured object traveling at 78.3 lights and accelerating.The object has not since passed through a secondary observation net, though it is likely to do so should it maintain current course for the near future.Telemetry was unable to discern the nature of the travel technology beyond recordings of space-time fluctuations.*

*At 78.3 lights, the manufactured object is calculated to be a galactic neighborhood threat.In the event of a sizable collision, it is expected the Zix, as well as all inhabitants within a 350,000 light year radius, will be destroyed.*

*The initial report, as well as various subsidiary reports, have been appended to this communication.Xy and Zyy are authorized to transmit this report as well as any response to the Zix.Singular contact will be ignored.*

*Cross Reference Reports: Sol Project, Divinity Angelysia, Galactic Neighborhood Impact Analysis, Travel Technology Assessment.*

The message sent, Xy and Zyy waited for the response, occupying their time by consuming the information flooding in.Xy set about creating a new taxonomy for the eighty-five thousand races, curious to see whether there were any with a similar biochemistry, social structure, or culture to the Zix.Zyy was consuming an inordinate amount of entertainment from foreign species, attempting to make sense of the preposterousness of singleton non-consensus interactions.Xy could only hope the Right didn't become infected by it.**Part Five** **.**

"You'll need to read Exhibit Three, I already covered that as a conditional to Subsection 23(a)."I leaned against the wall of the cave, watching at the swirling mist surrounding the djinn fluxed and pulsed as it paged through the contract."I thought you were supposed to be all-powerful."I checked my watch and cursed.The djinn's ineptitude was pushing into my 3 o'clock call.I pulled out my iPhone and shot a quick message to my secretary, telling her to swap my 3 with my 5, push my 4 to 6 and cancel the 6 altogether.I put it away, "Well?"The djinn glared up at me, it's red eyes swirling and malevolence, "Mortal, you presume to--"

I broke in, annoyed at the posturing."Listen, my time is valuable and yours is not.I bill out at $1250 an hour and you've got an eternity.Now, I went to the trouble of documenting out my wish so there would be no confusion, and I fail to see what is gained by continued delay.""I have never received a request with such..." he thumbed through the hundred plus pages, "...specificity.""Yes, well, there's a reason I bill at the rate I do.All manner of people enter into relationships and contracts without due consideration, and that's to their detriment.Thankfully for us both, I am not that sort of person, so we will not risk any...misunderstandings."I glance at a potted plant rather conspicuously sitting in the center of the cave.It looked suspiciously like a person, though I refrained from making the accusation without more evidence.The genie waved the contract in the air, "Surely we do not need to go to all of this hassle for a wish as simple as yours.""I do not view the request as simple.""You've asked for immortality.It is a reasonable request, a common one even, I could grant it with a snap, dispensing with all of this unpleasantness."The genie set the contract down atop a small pedestal that materialized beside him."An unnecessary precaution."I snorted, "I went to Harvard, Sir.I clerked with the Fourth Circuit.I am not fresh to a bargain, and I am not foolish enough to squander am an opportunity of this magnitude by failing to specify my request in detail.""You imagine harm where there is none.I merely seek to share my power, this is a gift, not a trap."I sighed, checking my watch again, and then pointing to the contract, "Do we have a deal or not?""Calm, nothing can go awry--"

I cut in, holding up a finger, "Point 1.A naked request for immortality does not specify the conditions of longevity.Subpoint A.It does not specify whether I will remain in good health.Subpoint B.It does not specify whether I will be recognized as immortal and therefore subject to scrutiny and imprisonment.Subpoint C. It does not specify the circumstances under which my immortality may be revoked -- for example heat death of the universe.""Yes, but--" The genie tried to interject.I speak over him, used to commanding a room and setting the tone for conversation between opposing parties.My coursework on negotiation had laid the groundwork and a career spent against aggressive counterparties had steeled my nerve.A second finger shot up, "Point 2.A naked request does not contemplate the disposition of the parties entangled and provides no representations or warranties as to the intent of the parties involved.Subpoint A.Do I have guarantees that you are acting in good faith?Subpoint B.Do you guarantee that you have the power to fulfill any such request on the terms contemplated?Subpoint C. Do you acknowledge that fulfilling such a request will not obligate me to any third parties?"My two fingers remain in the air and I take a step closer, "I have another 7 points behind this one sir, and that is just covering the basics.There are any manner of conditions, sub-conditions, breach provisions and so forth to consider, all of which I have painstakingly documented and provided so we would not need to have precisely the conversation we are having now."Another step closer, my eyes narrowing, "I begin to suspect you incapable of fulfilling your initial promise of a wish, and, if so, you should know that you will receive a complaint within the day specifying a plethora of damages both actually incurred and punitive I expect to extract from you as a consequence of your malfeasance."The djinn smolders, turning a shade darker as I pile on the various causes of action and various other tactics I intend to pursue as a result of its failure to perform."I am all powerful!"It howled, the wind swirling in the dark cave.I step back and smile, straightening my tie."Fantastic, then performance of your promise should be of no consequence."There was a silence, the djinn's eyes darting between me and the contract."There may be some need for...amendment and conditions.""I have already included all the conditions you previously established in Exhibit E. I do not intend to wish for more wishes or power capable of granting my own wishes."I fold my arms, the cufflinks with my initial engraved in them peeking out against the crisp white of my dress shirt.French cuffs were a bit flashy for the staid world of large firms, but I had my eccentricities.How else would I find myself in a buried cave containing a djinn?The djinn shifted, its hand coming to rest on the contract, "I may require additional time to seek counsel from representation of my own."I arch a brow, "Am I to believe all-powerful does not include the capacity to read a legal contract and become bound by it?I am loath to take a billable hour out of a colleague's account, but I daresay this smacks of malingering."Another silence, followed by a sigh."Very well."It raised its hands, "It shall be done."I check my watch and tap my foot, wondering whether I should have canceled the 6 o'clock."Then be on with it."A great plume of smoke rose from the ground, wrapping around the djinn and drawing inward."So be it!"It snapped its fingers.Almost immediately, the djinn began to howl, chains appearing on its arms as a translucent box appeared around it, pressing inward."What is the meaning--" it screams, trying to press against the cube.I watch as the djinn shrinks, pressed in by the cube as it grew smaller and smaller.Finally, it is no larger than a Rubik's cube, resting on the ground before me, the small djinn flitting back and forth within.I smile, and lean down to pick it up, "You really should have read the escrow provision."

**PART 2: SARAH**

I remember when it began.Remember the first jump.I don't know why it happened, don't know what caused it to start, but it did.One day I was the same, the next I was different.Adrift in the flow of time, unmoored and directionless.My da used to tell me stories about normal people that went on grand adventures.The journeys always sounded so magical.So exciting.Such danger, where your life could end in an blink of an eye.Blink of an eye.Life makes sense because of continuity.One day logically follows from the one before it.You make plans, you wait, and then those plans come to fruition.Your life is the relationship between you and the world around you.But what if that world changes?What if every time you blink there is a chance the world would be different when your eyes next opened?Is that still a life?I blinked.The streets were noisy and dirty.Crowded.Strange people were screaming and jostling beneath enormous burdens.Their clothing was different.I didn't understand why I wasn't at home.Why I wasn't sitting beside the fire with my da listening to the crackle of the flames.I had been there just a moment before.Where was I?I began to cry.Where?When?And then he was there.A strange young man with mysterious pale grey eyes.He knelt down and brought his eyes to look into mine.He looked so friendly.I looked at him, pleading for help but unable to summon the words.I was so grateful that someone could see me.That someone noticed."Sarah?"He whispered.He knew me.I wasn't alone.There was someone else.Someone who knew my name.I wiped my arm across my face, "I\-I\-I don't know what's going on.How do you know me?"He reached his hand out, offering it to me.I took it.Feeling the warmth of his hand spread into my body as I whimpered."I'm Zel.I met you a long time ago.When you were older."I stared at him, trying to make sense of it.Why couldn't I understand?"I...don't know what that means."I broke down into tears again, wanting so badly to understand.He pulled me closer, the warmth of his body adding to the warmth of his hand as he wrapped his arms around me.I felt tethered.No longer adrift.I was safe."You are special Sarah.Like me.Wherever you go, if you find me, i will be the same.I will be here in the world.Always waiting."I didn't want to be special.But I was happy that I wasn't alone.That Zel would be there.If I could find him.I wept into his shoulder, great heaving sobs as the mixture of relief and overwhelming confusion tore at me.Then I blinked.He was gone.But his warmth wasn't.It still heated my skin for the briefest of moments until the cold of this new world leeched it away.I was in a forest.Night pressed in around me, the faint glow of the moon glinting off of the snow on the ground.I looked around, trying to find Zel."Zel?"I whispered."ZEL!"I screamed.Nothing.Only the sounds of a forest deep in a winter's slumber.I began to shiver, I had the wrong clothes for this place.I did not know where I was, but I knew it would be okay if I could find Zel.He would make me warm again.I trudged through the forest.Gradually getting colder.Where was he?Why wasn't he waiting for me?It was like that for a long while.Shifting through time and trying desperately to find him before I blinked again.When I did find him, I tried to hard to keep my eyes open.Knowing that if I shut them for even an instant I may be gone again.May lose him again and never find my way back.I had so little time between blinks.It was so hard to find myself, much less him.I tried anyways.Every blink, I began the search anew.Hoping to find him before I was lost again.Sometimes I would see him, standing in the distance.I would run toward him, screaming frantically.Desperate to reach him.He would turn and see me, his grey eyes ablaze with joy, only for me to blink once again.But even those fleeting moments sustained me.The knowledge that he had seen me and that he was still there.That we were still connected.Occasionally we would get a chance to be together.To hold hands and to enjoy the moment between blinks.They were few, but they were there.Enough to build a life around.To have continuity.Context.It helped to deal with what I saw.The future is dark.Sad.We make so many bad choices.They always seemed okay at the time, and the consequences seemed so far off.I have seen the consequences.The dead world, choked by our own excesses.Destroyed by our greed.A barren slate.It happens, and we are to blame.I cannot do anything to change it.I can only stare at what we are to become.I blink.I stand before a beautiful field.The swaying grains flowing in beautiful golden waves before me.So much life after so much death.It takes my breath away.And then he is standing beside me."Hello Zel.""Hello Sarah."I reached my hand out, seeking the connection.The tether.He takes it and whispers, "It has been a long time.""Has it?"I squeezed his hand."I can never tell."I had seen him in the distance the day prior.A dozen blinks ago, but recent enough to still feel connected to him."How long?"I asked."A few centuries," he replied.My heart sank."That long?""Yes.""When did you see me last?""In the markets in Cairo.You were crying."I feel his palm pressed against mine."That was the first time."He was just getting to know me, though I already knew him.I had seen him hundreds of times.Touched him dozens.But this was new to him."Are you ok?"He asked."Yes.It helps when we find each other.""Why?"How could she explain to him what he meant?That he was the anchor?That he was the thing that gave her life meaning?She wanted him to know before she was left."You're my constant.You're the only way I know time.""I understand.You're my permanence.""I am glad we found each other this time Zel.The last trip was...upsetting.""Why?""The world doesn't always look like this.Sometimes things have gone wrong."There was nothing Zel could do to stop it.Dwelling would make no difference."What happens?""Let's just enjoy this moment.It will happen when it happens."We had a moment longer, hand\-in\-hand.My eyes watered as I tried to keep them open just a second longer.But it came, as it always did.I blinked.Life moved forward in blips and blinks.Searching.Finding.Holding.Loving.Each time he was the same, but I was different.I grew and progressed.I saw the world and grew to understand its arc over time.It was a chaotic and wonderful place.I was sorry that it would end as it would.I tried to save it, to impact things, but the blinks would not let me.It was as if I was chosen to see, but nothing more.Zel loved me.I loved him.In the short breaths we had together, we found our meaning.I cannot say how long we had together across the eons, maybe hours, but it was enough.It was sustenance for the soul.Toward the end, I was given the chance for a new beginning.I had traveled long and far.I had seen what I was meant to see, and I was ready to rest.The universe gifted me the chance to see him one last time.To meet him for the very first time.I blinked.I stood before a great river, softly flowing past.A young man sat beside it, his eyes gazing across it.I hobbled over and came to rest beside him."It's beautiful, isn't it?"I asked."Yes."A short pause."Who are you?"I smiled, realizing that this was the beginning for him."I forget that you haven't met me yet."I offered him my hand, just as he had offered me his at my beginning."I'm Sarah."He hesitated for a moment before accepting it."I'm Zel.""I know."You are my tether.You have given me meaning."How?Have we met?"He asked.How could I answer but the truth?"Yes.A long time ago and a long time from now.""What does that mean?""It means that I am special Zel.Like you, but different."I replied, turning to watch the Nile as well."Time doesn't pass for you?""It flows around me.I dip and dive throughout it, though I can't control it."I couldn't help but smile, thinking of the life that I had led.The chaos that had been woven into a continuity by the man that sat beside me."This is the earliest I have come back.""Oh.Do you like it?""I like that you are here.I wasn't sure you would be."How lucky, to be granted this."Are we friends?"Yes, Zel.But so much more."More."I blinked.***FIN***

Admiral Levinson reclined in the plush leather chair, his feet thrown up on the conference table in front of him.The cask of brandy he had been saving for their arrival at Alpha Centauri was opened and he was luxuriating in a quiet moment alone, one of the first since the nightmare revelations of a week prior.He was proud of the *Alcubierre's* crew, they had responded to the moment with the sort of professionalism he aspired to in the training but rarely reached in practice.A small chime pulled him from his reverie.Sighing, he removed his feet and tugged up the zipper on the side of his uniform before answering, "Enter."He was not scheduled to return to duty for another eight hours, but privacy was a prize, not an expectation, at times like these.The door slide open, revealing Science Officer Griggs, who entered a moment later, a nervous look on his face.Levinson grimaced, wondering what new horror Jack had conjured up in his experiments.It was getting to the point where he dreaded seeing Griggs despite the fact they had spent the better part of two decades in the black together."You're getting to be the last person I want to see during my off hours Jack," Levinson poured Jack a fresh glass and nudged it across the table, "Out with it."Jack slumped into the chair opposite of Levinson.His grey hair was frazzled, his blue eyes haggard and drawn.It looked like he'd gone on a three week bender and then played a game of rugby before falling down the stairs on the way home.Levinson winced, trying not to think too much on home.Jack reached out, taking a sip of the brandy.A little of the tension fell out of his shoulders when the burning liquid hit his throat.He took another sip and then set the glass down."I've got bad news Kai."Levinson freshened up his own glass, took a long draw and then shrugged, "What else is new?""Mostly everything, we're well into the uncharted here."Griggs replied.He was taking the upending of the universe's rules the hardest of the crew.The realization that two plus two might not add up to four outside the home bubble was not sitting easy with him.It was hard to be scientific when you had no idea what you could trust."Well, we signed up for the uncharted, so we can't complain too loud when that's where we ended up."Jack snorted, "Sure, but I was hoping for something within reason."His words fell off and a silence ensued, each regarding the other for a moment."You said you had news," Kai said."We're working on the fly.You know all bets were off once we dropped the bubble.None of the physics makes any sense--"

Kai held up a hand, cutting Griggs off, "Jack, we're past disclaimers at this point.Just give me what you got.""Well, we managed to chart out our course.It took some doing since we're trying to do it off of radiation smears, but the long and short of it is that we're way off from where we are supposed to be.""No surprise there.""No, I guess not.The catch is that we're way off.As in, we're out of the clear path," Jack said, his voice cracking on the word clear.He cleared his throat and then took a hurried gulp of the brandy, eyeing Kai over the rim."Out of the clear path," Kai repeated, the words coming out as a breathy mumble."How bad is it?""Very."Kai gave him a baleful glare, clearly expecting more."Asteroid belt bad.We're heading for the Proxima Barrier."The Proxima Barrier was a cluster of irregular orbit debris, mostly asteroids though a few were big enough to pass as a dwarf planet, that lay between Sol and Alpha Centauri.Their flight had been timed to avoid it, but those plans were clearly no longer applicable."Are we heading for a collision?"Kai asked.Jack nodded slowly in the affirmative."Can we divert course?"Jack shook his head, "Not at this speed and not with the time we have.""All right, well, I thought you told me that it's fine if we're the object in motion."Kai said, his voice raising in volume, annoyed at the cat and mouse game."We will be.""Then what the hell are we talking about Jack?""Home, Kai, we're talking about home."Jack replied quietly."What about it?"Suddenly, Jack threw his glass at the adamantine steel wall.The glass plunked against it and bounced off unharmed.The wall, on the other hand, had a prominent scar on it from the interaction."You ever see a glass survive a run in a steel wall Kai?You remember when you punched the wall yourself?"Kai nodded numbly, "All right, well, when I say we'll be fine, I mean it.We could punch through a planet and be fine right now as far as I can tell.The problem is that while we come away without a scratch like the glass over there, the planet and everything around it is going to feel real different about things.""So what are you saying?""I'm saying that if we run into the Proxima Barrier at the speed we're projected to, the shockwave from the collision is going to destroy Earth.It will take a few decades, but eventually it'll get there and that will be the end of home sweet home."Jack made an explosion sound to assist in the explanation, it was wildly incongruous with the seriousness of the situation."What are our options?""As far as I can tell right now, none.In one week, we will collide with Proxima Barrier and unleash a force the likes of which this galaxy hasn't seen since the big bang.""What about all of these new laws, isn't there a chance we're missing something?"Jack shrugged, "Best I have come up with is that could scuttle the *Alcubierre.* We're still running calculations on the relationship of mass to energy and force outside of the home bubble, but it is possible that reducing our size might reduce the impact energy enough, but I don't know."Kai pressed his lips together, his expression making it clear what he thought about that."Anything else?""Not unless you've got a wormhole in your back pocket."Kai stood up, any thought of rest and relaxation dispelled for the time being.He returned to being Admiral Levinson, hardened and focused, "Very well Officer Griggs, you have a week to figure it out, but I expect to hear more options by tomororw.Dismissed."Jack sighed and came to a stand.He snapped a salute, before turning on his heel and exiting the way he came.After he left, Admiral Levinson walked to the far side of the room and leaned down to retrieve the glass.The delicate crystal was unblemished, unmarred by any imperfection as a result of its battle with the wall.Frowning, Levinson clenched his fist, causing the glass to shatter.**Part Six can be found** **.**

"Premier Valast, the Committee on Astral Objects has analyzed the data thoroughly and is in agreement with the Zix Collective's conclusion: There has been a new Universal First."Committee Overseer Neeria's slits pulsed blue as she continued her report, the thoughtcast emanating along proprietary government channels."The observation nets administered by the Zix are Protocol Zero, as is to be expected for all areas subject to quarantine, so there is little chance of instrumentation error.Additionally, the supplementary reports and other documentation offered by the Zix leaves little room for doubt."Premier Valast shifted atop his cushion, his large ears flared outward, flapping slightly in irritation."Quarantine?"Neeria bobbed her head, "Yes, Premier.The object originated from a portion of Spiral Scutum that has been restricted due to a variety of anomalies that create instability within wormholes.We attribute it to residual aftereffects tied to  Divinity Angelysia experimentation in the area.Premier Valast's ears swept back, laying flat against his small skull as his eyes dilated.His dull brown fur bristled and it took a moment before he has gathered himself into a semblance of stately presence."The Angelysia are priority.Why was I not informed?"Neeria suppressed an irritated cluck.Having an X-14 as Premier continued to be problematic.It was difficult to communicate effectively with a being that expended so much energy on emotion.She wondered, not for the first time, what had possessed the Combine to elect Premier Valast as its leader."Confirming the information took some effort.Even now, the connection between the object and the Angelysia is uncertain.""Uncertain?""The object may have originated from the Sol Project or passed through it from further along the Scutum.It is difficult to discern given the information at hand.""The Angelysia continue their games."Valast snorted and waved a paw dismissively, "No matter, we will unravel it soon enough.What other news?"Neeria paused, knowing the next part would be received poorly, but the urgency required bluntness."We have parsed the observation information from the Outer Scutum Net, in particular the entry and exit points.This has allowed us to discern speed, acceleration and trajectory.At the point of entry the object was moving at 64.3 lights.Exit speed was 78.3 lights.Assuming there object maintains the same course, it appears to be targeting the star cluster closest to the Sol Project.""Is there anything of import there?"Valast asked, his paws idly picking through the fur of his chest as he listened."Nothing, though our surveys on the area have been limited.Even though the star in question lays outside of the Sol Project, it is still within the established quarantine zone making information gathering difficult.Our only information dates back to a period before we discovered the wormhole anamolies and shows nothing beyond a few planets and the three star cluster.""Why send the object then?""We believe there are only two likely motives: exploration and destruction."Valast's paws stopped moving, his ears perking up at the last, "Destruction?"Neeria nodded, her tone gaining a layer of intensity, "An object traveling at that speed might unleash tremendous destruction within this galaxy, particularly if the acceleration continues.Given the risks, the obvious superiority of wormhole as a means of travel and the difficulty of exceeding ten lights, it seems unlikely that a species possessing such a technology would deploy it against a relatively worthless star cluster.""You believe destruction is the more likely explanation then?"Neeria simply nodded, her four hands clasped together in front of her."Indeed."Valast sneered, "The Angelysia."He moved his hands about, pulling up the Premier's command console."How long will it take to intercept them?""Therein lies the problem Premier.The object appears to be traveling via spacial-disturbance within normal space at speeds far greater than we are able to maintain in space.We can only travel between points with the wormhole and are limited by the ten light barrier when traveling in normal space.""Speak plainly Overseer.What are our options?""We are considering a number of alternatives.We believe we can trigger a series of wormholes along their anticipated trajectory to potentially divert them into an intergalactic void."Neeria thoughtcast the schematic of the plan, showing a large fleet of Combine ships appearing along the corridor between Sol and the star cluster.After their arrival, a series of wormholes began to expand, one by one, creating a web between the two."What are the risks?""Numerous.There is a risk of womrhole contamination if they intersect.There is a risk that local anomalies will create unintended side effects.There is a risk the object has altered trajectory.There is a risk the object will collide with an object before--"

"Enough."Valast hopped forward on his pillow, perched up on his hindquarters."What do we need to deploy the plan?"Neeria shifted again, "Seven hundred and thirty four wormhole projection capable ships, and," Neeria paused for a long moment, "Access to the Zix wormkey."Premier Valast hissed, his ears flattening back to his head again, "They have never granted Combine access to their space."Neeria nodded, "Yes, they have rebuffed our efforts to engage with them on a...singular level...I believe they put it.""What do you propose?""We cannot travel in their space without the wormkey, it is the bedrock foundation of the Combine.We must gain their approval."Neeria replied."Very well.Summon the Plenipotentiaries.We will treat with them directly."Neeria bowed, "As you wish Premier."She did not have the will to explain to the Premier the folly of such a request.The Zix would not negotiate without consensus from their Collective.But Neeria could see no other way of proceeding, she would leave it to the strange denizens of the float-tank to explain the matter.**Continued in Part Seven** **.**

Premier Valast's ears perked up with interest as he entered the enormous hall that served as the diplomatic meeting space on the Halcyon way-station.On the far end was a gargantuan metal tank, its exterior featureless and smooth.For all of Valast's experience in treating with the various species that made up the Combine, this was a novel experience.His eyes quickly darted to Overseer Neeria, his whiskers twitching slightly.She nodded in response and spread her arms wide, her eye slits shifting to the neutral blue of communication."Premier Valast, I present to you Plenipotentiary Xy, Left Float Superior and Plenipotentiary Zyy, Right Float Superior, Emissaries of the Zix Collective, Species X-4831 of the Pan-Universia Combine."She bowed, the fingers on her upper arms fluttering slightly.Premier Valast inclined his head slightly and turned to regard the tank expectantly.There was no response.The moment of silence stretched on awkwardly, until a full minute had passed.Premier Valast shuffled his feet and then gave a small cough, "Overseer Neeria, do our guests have the capacity to speak?""Premier, I analyzed the diplomatic archives in preparation for this meeting and, judging by prior interactions, long pauses are to be expected.The Zix must reach consensus before they offer a response."The Overseer kept her tone carefully neutral as she relayed the information."Pauses?How long?As you know, there is some urgency to the matter."Premier Valast replied.Neeria shifted uncomfortably, her gaze fixed on the tank, "Premier, the archives indicate it takes a Zix pair between a day and three days to respond.Considerably longer if more than a pair is involved, so we are quite fortunat--"

"Three days?!Is this true?"Premier Valast "For a response?This must be wrong."\---

Xy and Zyy were not in consensus.Their cilia flailed at each other, intertwining and separating as they shuffled through dozens of thought threads in an attempt to find a common ground.As usual, Xy was finding the Right's ideas to be utterly preposterous.Not only was the Right's suggestion in direct contravention of their explicit orders but it was entirely beyond the scope of their consensus mandate.It was dangerous, toxic thinking.The Right wanted to return Premier Valast's greeting.Xy shoved another cilia into the mix, layering in an emotion thread to ensure that Zyy would understand precisely how preposterous and frustrating Xy was finding the situation.Their consensus mandate had been explicit: they were permitted to carry the response from Halcyon back to the Zix Collective, nothing more.A response of any kind would constitute singular contact, which was specifically prohibited by their mandate.Zyy seemed to think returning the salutation was simply a perfunctory and neighborly thing to do.That they could not receive the response without engaging with the Premier.If Xy had not spent the entirety of its existence coupled with the Right, it would think Zyy was a singleton.The very thought of being associated with such heresy was deeply disturbing.It had been some time since their tank had been scoured, perhaps the build up of pollutants was causing some mental deficiency in the Right.It was one thing to be Right-minded, it was another thing entirely to disregard the consensus of the entire Collective.Xy wondered, for the hundredth time, why two observation-specializations had been selected to perform as Plenipotentiaries.It was clear from this situation that they were thoroughly unequipped for the rigors of diplomacy.There were simply too many intricacies and interlocking parts involved for them to possibly perform this task.Zyy's own frustration now flooded into Xy, the Right taking umbrage of the characterization that it was a dangerous singleton in need of a diagnostic.It argued that they were sent because they were the most familiar with the underlying information, and that they were therefore the best positioned to inform the Combine of the possible threat to help the Combine formulate a response.Indeed, the Right seemed to be ready to exit the tank and spend their time among the Combine chatting freely about anything and everything it deemed fit, consensus mandate or not.Xy began to doubt the wisdom of having Rights.It was not the first time it had thought this, but it was the first time it began to believe it.\---

"Yes, Premier Valast, three days."Overseer Neeria shrugged, "sometimes more."\---

Science Officer Jack Griggs started from his slumber as the door to the lab slid open to admit Admiral Levinson.The Admiral conducted a brief survey of the chaos within and the disheveled state of his Science Officer before forging onward."I want good news and great news Jack.You've had your twenty-four, now I want to know what our options are."Jack groaned and rubbed his eyes with his balled up fists, "For the love of the black Kai, I've been pulling triples for a week.I'm doing what I can."He waved a hand about, "It ain't like we're on well-traveled ground here.The implications of all of this are staggering.We've spent our whole existence learning checkers only to learn the universe plays chess.Even more concerning than the fact that two plus two equals grapefruit is the fact that someone or, more accurately SOMETHING put us in that little box to play checkers."His words fell off as his eyes stared into the distance, "We aren't alone Kai.After all this time, now we know it."Kai snorted, "Well, if they're out there, then it'll be a shame if our first hello is a death halo."That was what they'd taken to calling the nova of destruction that would be unleashed if they did not find a way to avoid the collision with the Proxima Barrier.Jack was quiet, taking a few steadying breaths, "I don't have anything for you.I'm trying to apply the new rules as fast as I can figure out what they are but I need more time.""That's the one thing you can't have.It ain't fair, but the black never is.You know that just the same as I do."Jack's shoulders slumped, "We're still over fifty lights.None of this should be possible, none of it makes any sense.We dropped the bubble and somehow we pushed through the distortion to ride the wave on the other side.We're supposed to be dead stopped but instead we're a weapon of galactic destruction.""Not yet, we aren't.You've got six days to find the solution and implement it Jack.Try not to spend the next one the way you spent this one."Kai kicked a discarded bin with his boot, "I'll send a few cadets to help you get the place straightened up.Go get a shower and then come back in here and save the world."Jack gave the slightest of nods, but his mind was far away.&#x200B;

Premier Valast was gobsmacked.Each time his frustrations with the Zix reached a zenith, the maddening creatures somehow managed to squirt their way to a new height.He scrambled out of his pile of white fluff and crossed the distance to large metal tank and began to pound on the side with his paws, howling.Overseer Neeria watched with mixed emotions.On the one hand, she felt some sympathy for the Premier, knowing that the stakes were far too great for this degree of frustration.On the other hand, she could not help but be fascinated by the interaction.She was no Zix scholar, but she intended to be after today, assuming, of course, the galaxy still existed.On the third hand, the entire situation was quite humorous, a fact she tried very hard to hide considering the Premier's agitated mental state."Premier Valast, I strongly suggest you refrain from attacking the float tank, the Zix can be quite protective of their containers."Indeed, there was some evidence to suggest that the Zix viewed their floats as an extension of their corpus, meaning that the Premier's actions may be viewed as an assault on the Plenipotentiaries themselves.Even with the warning, it took some time for the Premier to collect himself.After he had spent his rage on the metal exterior, he took a moment to smooth his ears back and brush off his outfit before turning back to Neeria."Overseer, please inform our *guests* that wormhole projectors are not something the Combine *lends* out.They are under the guard and care of the Central Mercantile Fleet and not some *pleasure craft* for two idiots in a space bucket to play around with."Neeria found the speech curious.It was uncommon for the Premier to speak at length, his species known for their terse manner.She also wondered whether she was obliged to perfectly translate the contents of the message, given the hostile tone."Premier Valast, I do not believe the Zix will change their posture.Their willingness to engage in the first place was remarkable.The fact that they have developed a workaround to the wormkey compact is quite unexpected -- a single tank is not known for its problem-solving abilities."Valast's whiskers twitched.Neeria held out her four hands in what she hoped was a soothing gesture, "The ask is great, but so is the need."She paused for a moment before adding another thought, "And you will be the Premier who saved the galaxy by negotiating with the one species considered nonnegotiable."Valast's head tilted to the side, his ears perking up at the last bit."We will require the right of monitoring on the usage of our ship."The Overseer nodded, "I believe they will agree to such a stipulation."Valast tugged a whisker with his paw, pacing back and forth."Well, that leaves only one problem.""That is?""How do we wedge a giant tank onto the projector?"Valast asked.Neeria considered this and then gave a shrug, "Carefully, I imagine."\---

Xy already regretted agreeing to the Right's foolish plan.When it had acceded, there was a presumption that borrowing the wormhole projector would be a relatively benign affair.Indeed, Zyy had established an emotion thread at the time full of assuring calmness.The traitorous Right and its lying cilia had fooled Xy for the last time.But the accord was established and there was nothing for the Left to do but suffer in silence.Or, rather, in monstrous, jarring clanging mayhem as their poor float was glommed on to the exterior of the wormhole projector and integrated into its systems.Zyy was positively giddy as it squirted about the tank, brushing cilia along the portions that were being manipulated to enact the unholy union.It pulled in a translated external feed that allowed it to monitor the progress.Zyy seemed quite content to participate in sacrilege.Rights.Xy cowered in the center, its cilia curled inward, its bladders long since emptied so it could shrink its size.Each time Zyy approached, Xy would squirt away, making it clear that it wanted no part of Zyy's mind.Zyy did not even have the decency to feel remorse about the situation.It had even been amused when the Premier had attacked their tank, finding the frantic clawing quite entertaining.Xy realized now that it had been seduced by a wayward singleton.They were a rogue tank now, it was sure of it.No sane Left would ever countenance the insanity they now embarked upon.Xy assumed they would be destroyed on sight once the Zix saw the abomination they had become.Xy's only solace was that they would surely be a cautionary tale for other Lefts, a parable passed from float to float on the dangers of Right-brained foolishness.At least Xy's folly would serve some purpose then.Xy, the Left who went Right.The shame was unbearable.\---

Science Officer Jack Griggs stared into the majesty of space, his mouth ajar.It looked different.Wrong.Where were the stars?Only lines.Lines everywhere.Long streaks of white and blue and yellow.No points.No stars.Where had they gone?Jack began to laugh, a small tendril of drool spilling from the corner of his mouth and stretching down to his chest before it snapped off and fell to the ground."Where are the stars?"He slammed his head against the viewscreen, causing it to crack and then shatter into shards.Gingerly, he pulled his head back, the laugh fading as his raised a trembling hand up to his forehead.It was unblemished.Unharmed."It's all wrong," he whispered, "Someone took the stars."Jack collapsed to his knees, repeating the words over and over until they slurred together in a mumble.\---

"What's wrong with him, Kate?"Admiral Levinson peered down into the medical bed, his face a mask of concern."Kai, he's exhausted.I pulled bios from his badge and he hasn't hit REM in days."She displayed a medical chart above Jack's bed.The chart contained a series of graphs, each of which showed a series of green lines that deteriorated into yellow, then orange, then red."Sleep.Nutrition.Stress levels.Emotional state.They're all red."Chief Medical Officer Kate Lee gave the Admiral a hard stare, "He's been working himself too hard.Pushing himself way past the limits."Kai slumped into the chair beside Jack's bed, raising a hand to massage the bridge of his nose."I told him to take a break...to ease off.""Well, Jack has never been one to rest easy when he's under your thumb, Kai," Kate replied, the tone making it clear what she thought of that.Levinson did not rise to the bait, "He was our best hope, probably our only hope.You're right, I pushed him, but I don't have any other options here.We've got an unsolvable problem and I went to the only man that can dig me out."He slumped further into the chair."Dig us out.""All he is digging is an early grave.I've stabilized him but he'll need some time to recover."Kai chuckled, letting his hand fall away as he stared up into the lights embedded into the ceiling, his eyes unfocused."Time...well, sure."People always wanted what they couldn't have.The *UWS Alcubierre* was out of time.**Part Twelve may be found** **.**

Admiral Levinson stared at the viscera splayed across the floor of the common room.It was a crimson splatter of smooth red blood, occasionally interrupted by a hunk of something important that didn't belong anywhere outside of a body.He'd seen his fair share of bloodshed, but he couldn't quite remember seeing anything like this before.His eyes shifted to the side, where a man sat hunched in the corner, his hands in manacles with a blank stare on his face."Go through it again Ensign Negusse."The ensign simply stood beside the admiral, his gaze fixed on the remains.Admiral Levinson snapped his fingers, "Negusse, report."The ensign started back to reality and then snapped a quick salute, "Yes sir, sorry sir."He paused, gathering himself together before continuing, "I was just beginning second shift at security hub when we received a report of a disturbance in the common room.We pulled up the view and saw Ensign Smith," he glanced quickly at the man huddled in the corner, "in a verbal altercation with Ensign Polis.I was dispatched from the hub with instructions from the Chief of Security."He took a long breath, "It took me approximately one minute and ten seconds to cover the intervening distance.By the time I entered the room, it was over.""What was over?"Admiral Levinson asked, gently probing, searching for more details."Sir, according to witnesses the fight continued to escalate and eventually Ensign Smith attacked Ensign Polis.""Attacked him how?""Well, sir, he just...punched him."Ensign Negusse replied, uncertain.Beads of sweat shined atop his shaven pate, the entire situation clearly unnerving him."A single punch?""Yes sir, that is what they said said.They said Ensign Smith punched Ensign Polis and then his head...exploded."The red splatter had sprayed across the room.On the far wall, a jaw bone was lodged in a countertop.Ensign Polis' headless body lay crumpled up on the far side of the room.Admiral Levinson nodded and then turned to Ensign Smith in the corner, "Ensign Smith, you were notified of the restrictions on crew activity, were you not?"The ensign continued staring, his eyes locked on the body.Admiral Levinson sighed, "Get him to the brig Negusse and get the clean up crew in here.I'll make an announcement to the crew on the situation, though I imagine the ship is already abuzz about it."Ensign Negusse snapped another salute, went over and retrieved Ensign Smith and then made his exit.The admiral turned back toward the body, regarding the scene, forcing himself to internalize it.After a long moment, he gave a disgusted shake of his head and then left as well, his feet taking him along the cold steel corridors until he was outside a familiar door.He hit the small button beside the frame to announce his presence.Receiving no answer, he authorized a command override and forced the door open.Chaos greeted him.The room was dark and cluttered with various tablets and glowing holographic projections.A quick survey was more than enough to know that Jack had not been getting much sleep, and, by the smell of things, not many showers either."Jack, you in here?"Levinson stepped past the threshold and into the interior, taking pains to sidestep the tablets.The dim light provided by the projections gave him little solace, as each showed the hapless *UWS Alcubierre* colliding with various objects and sparking the massive death halo that would doom them and half the galaxy."Jack?"There was a rumbling groan from across the room and some movement.Levinson closed the distance only to find Jack curled up in the corner, a tablet clutched in his hands.The creature in front of him was a shade of the man Kai had proudly stood beside over the years, reduced to ashes before the only problem he couldn't solve and the only one that mattered.Kai sat down beside him, his hand resting on the science officer's shoulder, "It's okay Jack.You gave it your all, sometimes the universe just doesn't want to play by the rules."Jack rubbed his sleeve across his eyes, though they remained dull and unfocused, "It plays by the rules...just not our rules."His speech was weak and uncertain, the failure eating away at him, "I'm learning as fast as I can, but it's...it's like starting from fire and trying to get to quantum phasemology in a single leap."Kai settled into the chair, "Is that hard?"Jack didn't take the bait, he simply sighed."I just left a room that got a new coat of red paint because some poor dumb kid decided to punch another.Even seeing it, even with knowing what I know, it still don't make any sense."Kai said.Jack nodded, "Welcome to my world.""Still nothing?"Jack sighed and gave a small nod."Nothing."\---

Premier Valast had waited long enough, his time was limited and it could not be spent idling about."They have had an hour, we do not have time for this."Valast had hopped up, his small legs carrying him around his pillow a few times as he paced in agitation.Overseer Neeria cocked her head to the side, her arms cautiously tucked in front of her torso, "Premier, my search of the archives did not produce any methods for forcing the Zix to engage at a more accelerated speed."Premier Valast fixed the large tank with a baleful glare, "How did they enter the Combine?"Neeria's eye slits shifted to green as she began to access her knowledge stores, "They achieved consensus on a species level and accepted the Combine Compact."Neeria's arms began to move in small fluttering gestures, "Most scholars believe the ease of consensus was attributable to the fact that the Zix as we know them are but a remnant of a much larger species, one that was mostly eradicated some time before our first interaction."The Premier's ears perked up, "Oh?""Yes, Premier.While we do not have direct confirmation, we have reason to believe that the entirety of the Zix exist on a single float colony.The nature of the colony and the Zix physiobiology clearly indicates a terrestrial origin.However, there is no mention or reference to a home planet during any of our interactions with the Zix, and their initial requests as Combine members seemed primarily focused on maintaining their colony rather than the needs of an entire world.""Perhaps they are a rogue element, cast out from the main body.""This has been considered and discussed at length.The nature of their social-strata makes it highly unlikely that a splinter group could exist, though it isn't impossible.Unfortunately, the restrictions on their wormkey prevent us access to their occupied space, so we have been unable to ascertain more information on the matter on our own."Valast stopped pacing for a moment, "They reached consensus quickly when under an existential threat, correct?"Neeria nodded, "Indeed.They accepted the Combine Compact within two days of coming into contact with us.""Do they know the threat they face now?"Neeria paused, "I do not know.""Perhaps someone should tell them."**Part Nine can be found** **.**

Overseer Neeria's eye slits turned to a deep blue as she processed the inbound communication."Premier Valast, the Zix have elected to respond."Her voice was atonal, oddly shifting about in an effort to conceal the multitude of reactions rising within her.Such out-of-mandate communication was unprecedented in the entire history of the Zix.Even with the dire nature of the Combine's second message, she had not expected a response.Premier Valast sat up in his small pillow, his ears flapping irritably, "What have they said?Will they coordinate with us?""Very little as of yet Premier Valast, they have simply acknowledged that they will communicate."Valast's maw hung ajar, nonplussed."They responded to tell us they will respond?"Neeria nodded, "Yes, it is remarkable progress.""Remarkable...progress..." Premier Valast blinked.There was a pause, as if the implications of the statement were working their way through his neural pathways, slowly overcoming the surreal sense of disbelief that impeded their progress.Finally, a look of fury overcame him, his whiskers bristling.His paws flew into a frenzy, digging at the velvet pillow beneath him, yanking out embroidered patches as he tore it apart.\---

Xy and Zyy floated beside one another, each taking comfort in the other's presence.For all of Zyy's bluster, trepidation had crept in just before they had sent the response indicating their intention to respond.Xy felt positively Right-minded when it had submitted the communication command in conjunction with Zyy.It wondered how they would explain themselves to the Collective when they returned to the float colony.Zix history was rife with the stories of singleton folly, and more than one cautionary tale spoke of rogue tanks and the havoc they had wrought in times past.But there had been little choice in the end, the Combine's information was simply too important to not act upon.The stakes too high.It had been Zyy, in its outlandish Right logic, that had found the justification to permit their response.While their mandate only stated they were to deliver their message, their observation-specialization permitted the gathering of information of import to the Collective.Their specialization was a prime function, a basic expression of their identity.Not acting on the specialization would be, in some ways, an even greater violation than breaching the mandate.Particularly given the nature of the information they now sought.How could data relating to the survival of the Collective be anything other than of import to the Collective?Indeed, Zyy argued, they were specialization-bound to collect it.And, since there were no other means of information gathering other than communication in this instance, they were obligated to communicate.Flimsy, but just solid enough for the Left to dangle a few cilia on.If the Right's logic was unsound, then they would accept whatever judgment was placed upon them.Perhaps this was how all rogue tanks felt at the moment of their treason, but the decision was made and, as all Zix knew, a ripple could not be recalled.\---

"Another message Premier Valast," Overseer Neeria said as she translated the communication from Zix into Combine Common.The Zix language was quite interesting, a smattering of pressure and electric impulses.She wondered how the Combine had managed to build the initial language bridge.As far as she could discern, the Zix language was entirely unique, both in terms of communication style as well as the underpinning structure.For all of the diversity in the Combine, the vast majority of species seemed to rhyme with one another.The Zix stood alone.It was hard to rhyme with zaps of electricity and water squirts."And?"Valast lounged among a pile of white stuffing, all that remained of his pillow after his anger had been spent."They seek any and all information related to the nature of the threat," she replied."Much has already been provided, but we will guarantee that all further developments by Combine researchers will be made available to them."He came to stand, his nimble paws delicately combing through his fur to remove the small clumps of stuffing.There was still some disarray to his appearance, and he set about making himself presentable again, taking the time to pull the tunic covering his frame straight and rearrange the insignia of office on his lapel."We need them to grant us access to their wormkey."Neeria's eyes flitted to green as she accessed the archives, pulling the data related to the Zix wormkey as well as all instances where a wormkey compact was altered.Eyes blue, Neeria continued, "Premier, the Zix have maintained an extremely strict wormkey compact, one that has not been altered since its inception.None other than authorized Zix floats are permitted to make use of it."Premier Valast's ears flattened back, a snarl coming to his face, "This is why they must agree to change.""They are unlikely to agree to such a thing, particularly without consultation with the Collective.""They must agree or face their end.They do not have worm projectors," Valast said, his voice coming shrill as the frustration of the situation began to overwhelm him.He was not the first Premier to regret the presence of the wormkeys, but he very well might be the last.Species' control over their own colonized space was a hallmark of Combine membership, a means of providing each member with the ability to determine which ships would be permitted access to point-to-point travel in their domain.It was impossible to open a wormhole within protected space without wormkey access.Without Zix cooperation, there would be no way to intercept the object."I will provide the Zix with this information," Neeria said.\---

Xy and Zyy were unfamiliar with worm projectors.A query to the archives provided some insight on the matter.In the intervening time since their last contact, the Combine had developed a means for creating stable wormholes that were untethered to a point-to-point drive.It was used primarily to facilitate large scale trade routes between mercantile worlds.An intriguing innovation, but of little utility to the self-contained Zix.Xy did discern the applicability to the issue before them but found the prospect of altering the wormkey compact untenable.Xy and Zyy duly communicated this to the Premier.Firstly, the question arose of whether Xy and Zyy were even capable of such a thing.Secondly was the matter of it being beyond their mandate.Thirdly, the logic thread Zyy had used to justify information gathering as an observation-specialization did not apply.There was a fourthly, a fifthly and a sixthly as well, but Xy considered the initial three to be fatal without the need to enumerate the rest.Their explanation was met with a great deal of explanation in return, during which the catastrophic nature of their refusal was repeatedly highlighted.Xy and Zyy clung together in their tank, exhausted.They had been melded for hours, an energy-consuming and emotionally draining effort.They maintained a number of thought threads, some exchanging logic on various debates, others pulling archive data to supplement their discourse, and still others devoted to the painstaking effort of communicating.They had dropped the emotion thread some time ago, finding it a needless distraction to their already difficult work.Xy grew agitated, jetting in a small orbit around Zyy, hoping that swirling currents might bring it some comfort.They did not.There seemed to be no answer to their quandary.The wormkey compact was inviolate.There could be no amendment, abridging, or other alteration without a Zix Moot, which would place them outside of the critical window to act.Xy could find no answer.It took the inane foolishness of a Right to find a solution.\---

"They what?"Valast asked."They want to borrow one," Neeria replied.**The story is continued in Part 11 found** **.**

The second transmission from the Premier arrived before Xy and Zyy and reached a decision on whether to respond to the first message.Xy found it quite unseemly for the Premier to complicate matters by introducing an additional element into their internal deliberations.Little more than an hour standard time had passed since the first message, and the Left had only just begun to tangle with Zyy on the nature and scope of their mandate.Zyy remained stubbornly insistent that they were expected to engage in carefree banter with the Premier, a viewpoint thoroughly unsupported by actual text of their charge as well as established precedent.And now a second message.Thoroughly intolerable.Were it to come from a fellow Zix, it would be the height of rudeness.But Xy was not among its kind.It was not here, a place no observation-specialization should ever be, doing things no observation-specialization should ever do.Zyy's boldness did little to help matters.As Xy pulsed about in small circles of frustration, its cilia flitting to and fro in irritation, Zyy consumed the contents of the message.As it reached the end, the Right's cilia stood on end.Great currents swirled around Zyy as it jetted across the tank toward Xy.The Right had enough speed that it collided with Xy, sending the Left's cilia flailing with indignation.Zyy latched on, establishing four thought threads and an accompanying emotion thread, overwhelming Xy with a meld that sent great gouts of information through the threads.The prime thought thread pulsed, sending a searing message.They were in danger.Their tank.Their kind.Their galaxy.The emotion thread tied to it dripped with fear and angst.Of an overwhelming desire to avoid the fate the prime thought thread spoke of.The remnant, the last float colony, gone.A final end to the Zix.The second thought thread carried the details of the communication.Information on the Sol Project available to the Zix via the Archive Pan-Universia had been limited.The reasons for this were unclear, but currently immaterial in light of the supplementary facts.Xy and Zyy's report had provided confirmatory evidence on archival data, firmly establishing the veracity of a number of facts and troubling conclusions derived therefrom.The relationship between the Sol Project and the Divinity Angelysia had been previously established, but the nature of the project was only now confirmed by the appearance of the centalight interstellar object.Sol was a planned system, established approximately seven tenths current universe age.The purpose of the system had been shrouded in mystery, with remote observation being the only method of ascertaining information due to the Divinity's creation of a highly restrictive physics bubble a half light year from the star.A number of theories had been put forth about the nature of the project, the Divinity's behavior always the source of interest among the Combine's scholars.Some speculated the bubble was simply an effort to measure the effects of physics rules changes, but this line had met with substantial skepticism due to the broad knowledge the Divinity possessed as a Type Three civilization.Such experimentation would be unnecessary.Additionally, it seemed nonsensical that the Divinity would establish such a project given the length of time it would take to come to fruition.Of course, it would not be the first time the Divinity's behavior confounded the Combine.In any case, the breach of the bubble by an object from within the restricted space laid that theory to rest.Any experiment would have an impervious bubble.Otherwise a proper study would be impossible.The appearance of the object suggested something much more disturbing: a transcend bridge.The Sol Project was a means of re-establishing the Divinity Angelysia in the universe after their civilization disappeared into the great beyond.An insurance policy of sorts, an opportunity to restart.Xy tried to understand.To piece together how the possibility of a transcend bridge might connect to the end of the Zix.The third thought thread helped in this matter greatly.It was quite simple really, if the beings behind the source object were truly the Divinity reborn, then they were beings capable of attaining a Type Three Civilization -- a total consumption of all energy output in an entire galaxy.A galaxy the Zix shared with them.The fourth thought thread raised the stakes further.The centalight object was on a collision course.Should the beings behind it elect not to slow down or change course, then it would cause an explosive force great enough to destroy a significant portion of the galaxy.Whether it was the intent, a threat, or something else entirely, could not be ascertained.Without some form of intervention, an effort to intercept or communicate, the end of the Zix was a real and immediate possibility.Xy understood Zyy's concern.The threat that they faced.It too felt the same fear.This was not a time to hide behind the text of their mandate.Xy was resolved, ready to attain consensus.They must be bold.They would respond to the Premier.**Continued in Part Ten** **.**

96.A chill ran up my spine as I tried to piece together how it happened.I had guessed on every question, gone out of my way to be as thoughtless about my answers as humanly possible.But there it was.One over the mark.I stared at the computer screen, my brain slowing as the numbing power of fear began to override the rational thought processes.Over and over again I returned to one thought: This must be a mistake.A knock sounded out a moment later, causing me to fall from my seat in a jumble.I tried to gather myself, but the knock returned, more insistent this time."Who is there?"I called out down the hallway as I managed to clamber to my knees.No answer.Just the sound of the doorknob slowly turning.It was locked, but the door obliged the visitor and opened nonetheless.Just outside stood a small man, no more than four feet tall, his figure illuminated by the dull light my porch lamp against the darkness beyond.He wore a waistcoat with a gold chain leading to a small pocket.Spectacles perched on his nose and he had a small tuft of brown hair atop a rapidly balding pate."Mr.Clark?"He asked, his eyes settling on mine.I nodded."Very good."He stepped across the threshold of my house and began to make his way down the hallway, the clacking of his leather-soled shoes ringing out.I had just managed to stand when he arrived before me, looking up through his spectacles."Congratulations on passing the test, it is quite an accomplishment."I shifted nervously from foot to foot, "I think there's uh...some sort of mistake.""Oh, the test is quite foolproof.Your score is an accurate reflection of your abilities," the man replied, pulling on the chain and yanking out his pocket watch.He checked the time, tsked under his breath and then put it away."But I guessed on everything," I said, a flush rose up in my face at the admission."So you did.It is really quite exciting, we have so few Ambients."A small smile appeared, his pearly white teeth showing."Truly, it couldn't have come at a better time.""Ambients?"I asked, perplexed."Individuals in tune with and capable of channeling the entropy of the universe."He began to wave a hand around as he spoke, "Of course there are Empaths, as well as your run-of-the-mill Brains, and even the occasional Pattern Master, but your sort really are quite rare."A dark black sedan pulled up outside, the windows tinted black."Ah, our transportation is here.Come along Mr. Clark, we are under some time pressure."He began to walk down the hallway, not bothering too look back at me.I hesitated, feeling a strong desire to run the opposite direction screaming.As he reached the door, he turned back again, a small frown appearing on his face."We really must get going."A strange intensity came over him and his features tensed."I understand how you feel."Almost immediately I felt a connection to him, as if my heart were tethered to his.In that moment, I believed he did understand how I felt just as I believed everything would be fine if I went with him.I began to inch forward, as if the connection between us was tugging me along."I'm scared.""Of course you are Mr. Clark, everyone is scared at first, even me."And I knew it was true.I could feel the terror the man had experienced so long ago when it had been his time.But he had been fine.Everything would be fine.He reached out a hand, "Come Mr. Clark, there are matters of great import we must attend to."I took his hand, feeling an overwhelming sense of compassion emanating off of the man."I...I understand."We crossed into the outside and made our way down the steps toward the car.As we approached, the door swung open, revealing a plush interior.I glanced at the door, "Where are we going?""To the center of things Mr. Clark.To the boundary of Here and There."I felt a tremor of fear well up through our link."We are losing Mr. Clark, and there isn't much time."He climbed into the car and turned to look back at me.The connection between us faded, leaving me feel alone and isolated."You have a choice Mr. Clark, but if you choose to remain, you may well be choosing a fate for a great many of other people.""Why?""Because, Mr. Clark, that is the way of matters involving life and death.Choices have consequences."He held out his hand."Join us."I looked down at it, emotions running riot through me."Why me?""There is no one else."I clasped his hand in mine, "I'll come."**This is a GLIMPSE of the Emerging Universe** **.**

The joining of their tank to the monstrous behemoth the Combine labeled a wormhole projector was complete.New readouts and information floated past Xy, providing it with a better understanding of the depths of their blasphemy.The exterior of their tank was scarred by the great welds adjoining their tank to the corpus of the projector.While the Combine had taken great care to avoid penetrating the shell of the tank, the delicate ecosystem of micro-fluidic pressure was noticeably altered, creating odd dissonances that degraded the flow of knowledge within.It was a jarring indictment of the flow they traveled.Zyy continued to insist that they had made the correct decision.That this course of action was the only means of saving their species.It sounded very much like the extremist singleton thoughts that dominated the Combine entertainment Zyy had consumed upon their arrival.The concept of heroes was foreign to the Zix, and rightfully so.The Zix would save the Zix, just as they always had.Rogue tanks brought nothing but trouble.Each effort by Zyy to convince Xy only further increased Xy's concern.The Zix were a pragmatic species, holding few things sacred.The importance of consensus and the sanctity of the tank.Somehow, the Right had managed to ignore both in its quest for singleton glory.The situation was as confusing as it was alarming.Xy had been Zyy's tank companion for a long time, and, while the Right never managed to achieve the thoughtful sensibility of a Left, Xy had considered Zyy acceptably foolish.Recent behavior made Xy wonder whether it had misjudged the Right.Now they lacked a viable alternative.There was no longer enough time to reverse the flow.The current carried them inexorably forward and Xy was not strong enough to resist it.It would be swept along, and struggling would only create ripples that would undermine what small chance they had.Xy let its reservations go, knowing they were unproductive.Completing the mission would require their combined effort.Xy floated next to Zyy, accepting a few thought threads.Together, they planned their journey to the fringes of Zix space.There could be no certainty that their effort would be successful, that they would even manage to find the hurtling object from Sol.The possibilities were enormous, branching off into n-squared upon n-squared problem spaces, but it did not matter.They would try.For the moment, Left and Right worked as one.Xy and Zyy were in consensus.\---

Admiral Kai Levinson regarded himself in the mirror.He had managed to pull himself together enough to be presentable, but the wear and tear of the time since the crisis began was evident.Kai ran a hand through his grey hair, trying to smooth it out.It was hard to muster the effort, but he believed the crew was entitled to professionalism.It was the least he could do.He nodded to himself and then exited his quarters, making his way toward the bridge of the *Alcubierre*.The hall was alive, filled with the comings and goings of servicemembers about their designated tasks.Each stopped and offered the Admiral a salute.He nodded to each as he continued along.He made the effort to look at each person in the eyes, hoping to instill them with the sort of courage he felt himself sorely lacking.His head mired in the morose, Kai stepped onto the bridge.The crew members of the bridge snapped to attention as he entered, each standing beside their designated console."At ease," Kai said as he made his way to the area in front of the viewing screen."Comms, open up a channel shipwide."After receiving the go-ahead, Kai cleared his throat."Crew members of the *UWS Alcubierre*, as each of you know, we have been thrust into an unusual situation.I would like to take the opportunity to discuss the matter and explain our current disposition."Burying the lede to be sure."Shortly after our departure from Sol, we crossed some manner of boundary, the nature and source of which remains a mystery to us."He took a deep, steadying breath."Beyond the boundary is a greater mystery still.The immutable laws of physics, the guideposts for all of our scientific knowledge, simply do not seem to apply.We have expended incredible effort attempting to discern the nature of the new reality we find ourselves in, but we have been largely unsuccessful."Kai let his gaze wander around the bridge, meeting the eyes of each person who had placed their faith in him.He did not allow himself to flinch away.He had brought them to their doom, the least he could do was look them in the eye."Early on, we discovered that we were traveling at speeds far greater than should be possible.We realized this shortly before our Alcubierre drive was rendered inoperable by the unique strain placed upon it by the unusual rules in effect."Kai began to pace back and forth, his voice maintaining its clear, commanding tone."We updated course projections and have discovered that our greater speed places us on a collision course with the Proxima Barrier.We have made use of our quantum vacuum thruster, but it is insufficient to avoid the obstacle and we are unable to alter course at a velocity in excess of the speed of light.""The odd nature of this physics we are now operating within will allow the Alcubierre to survive the collision with the Proxima Barrier but\*....\*" His breath hitched now, dreading the revelation to follow."It will also mean the destruction of the greater part of the Milky Way, including our home."The crew on the bridge glanced between each other but otherwise remained stoic.Kai credited them for maintaining their composure.It was a fine group of people.The view screen flared to life, showing a visualization of the projected collision and ensuing aftermath.A small blinking dot representing the *Alcubierre* hurled into a long line populated by planetoids of various sizes.Immediately a large nova exploded outward, consuming the surrounding planetoids and beginning its slow march across the stars.The blinking dot of the *Alcubierre* continued onward, outpacing the devastation in its wake.The simulation sped up, showing the nova slowly consuming more and more of the galaxy, each subsequent interaction with the nova creating still move novas in an expanding chain reaction."Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to find a solution to avoiding a collision."Behind him, the viewscreen showed the mutilated arm of the galaxy humanity called home.They had survived the crucible of Earth only to bring their folly to the universe.Lieutenant Lee stood up from behind her console and snapped to attention.Kai nodded to her, "Speak at will Lieutenant.""Sir, what if..." she paused and looked around the bridge, "what if we initiated the Zed Protocol?""We have considered that.The destruction of the *Alcubierre* will only increase the odds of a catastrophic collision."Lieutenant Lee looked as if she had been struck, a glaze falling over her eyes as the color drained from her face.Stumbling slightly, she sat back down."But...what...what will we do?"Admiral Levinson regarded her quietly for a moment, "There's nothing we can do."A tear leaked down the corner of her eye, "When?""Soon."**Part Thirteen can be found** **.**

The situation was maddening.This section of space was thinly instrumented, leaving little for ZyyXy to work with beyond what was contained in the original Anomaly Alert.ZyyXy only knew the point where the Sol Object had passed through the sensor net, its trajectory, its speed and its rate of acceleration.It could attempt to project a path and intercept, but such an approach assumed far too much to be effective.ZyyXy had been forced to go to the point of origination, parse the space-time data and construct a tracking model on the faster-than-light signature.It was an imperfect solution, but ZyyXy lacked an alternative.ZyyXy followed its quarry.Lurching along the trail as it slipped between wormholes.It had been slow er at first, the time between each leap extended by the need to confirm that the Sol Object had not changed course.After the first set of jumps, ZyyXy became increasingly convinced that the Sol Object would not alter its trajectory.It plotted straight toward the small cluster of stars in close proximity to the Sol system, though the intent remained unclear.In either case, the realization allowed ZyyXy to act with greater confidence, extending the length of the jumps in an effort to catch up.The Zix were somewhat inoculated from the vagaries of punching through the space-time continuum, though few, if any, species had attempted so many hops in so short of a time.The stress began to wear on ZyyXy, compounded by the odd dissonance within the tank due to the pressure exerted by the wormhole projector and the effort of single action.Each jump seemed to affect the flows, creating a subtle resistance, a hesitation to abide by the commands.ZyyXy sensed the rebellion, but refused to succumb.If the flows would not obey, they would be forced to.ZyyXy inhaled great gouts of tank fluid and expelled it, washing away the micro-fluidics with brute force.There would be a price to pay for disrupting the ecosystem, but ZyyXy felt no remorse.Its perseverance manifested in a substantial reduction in the time between wormholes, allowing ZyyXy to cover more area.The signature grew stronger with each leap, but as ZyyXy closed the distance on the Sol Object, so to did the object close the distance on the obstacles ahead.The Sol Object appeared to be attempting to slow its progress, but the decrease in speed was simply too small to alter the outcome.Time had run out.ZyyXy leapt forward.\---

The view screen flashed red, a proximity alert warning pulsing violently as the blinking dot of the *UWS Alcubierre* entered into the cluster of astral objects known as the Proxima Barrier.Kai wished it would be over quickly, that the crew and the galaxy beyond would not suffer as a result of his actions.But it may not be in the cards.Griggs had said they may even survive this, that they would continue on into the darkness of space knowing that they had unleashed a force that would scour their home from existence.They would be the last of humanity.Would they simply give up?His eyes remained fixed on the view screen, though the fine men and women who served with him registered on the periphery of his vision.He could not imagine leading them through the darkness beyond Proxima.Let it end.His eyes squeezed shut, his mind seeking calm even as adrenaline flooded his system.He thought of the swirling ball of blue, white and green he had left behind."I'm sorry," he whispered.A minute passed.Two."Sir?"Lieutenant Lee's uncertain voice broke through the silence."Something's strange."A giddy thought rolled up in Kai's mind.Strange?You're only just noticing Lieutenant Lee?Kai's eyes cracked open, and focused on the viewscreen.The proximity alert was gone.They widened now, shock registering."What is going on Lieutenant.""I...I don't know sir.We're...not where we are supposed to be."She flipped between various readouts on her console, but it quickly became apparent she was gleaning no new information from them."All of the information is wrong.""Don't get to the conclusion before you're got a hold on the situation Lieutenant.We're alive, the galaxy isn't on fire, let's call that a win for the time being and get to the bottom of this."Kai flicked the latch on his restraining harness and stood up from his chair, making his way over to the Lieutenant's console.He leaned forward, his head coming down beside the Lieutenant's.It had been some time since he'd manned the helm, but it looked largely the same."Now, walk me through what you're seeing."She pulled up the navigation readout, "We're pulling smear data as quickly as we can, but it's corrupted."She pulled up a small window showing a variety of lines.They pulsed and spiked with regularity."See how it repeats?"She pointed to a series of valleys and peaks and then to another series further down the chart."That can't happen."Kai squinted, "Explain.""Each star and its position gives a unique smear as we pass it."She slowly drew her finger along the line, showing the peak of a red line, "This is us passing by a red dwarf."She skipped forward, and pointed at another red line as it moved toward a peak."According to this, we are passing the same red dwarf.""Assuming it is true, where are we?"She turned and looked up at him, wetting her lips before continuing, "Where we were two days ago."Kai jolted upright, tapping the comms relay into the medical bay, "Griggs, get me Griggs.""He is still convalescing, he needs more time to recover," Medical Officer Kate Lee replied, the stern tone making it clear she felt little compunction about resisting Kai's demand."Kate, then I've got exactly what he needs."A stony silence greeted him for a few seconds."What?""More time."\---

ZyyXy was satisfied with the outcome.It was a Species First, no other member of the Zix had saved the galaxy before.Perhaps it was even a Combine First.More importantly, it was a justification for the actions it had taken.The Zix placed the means before the ends, a mistake.When the outcome was suitably important, the means must be whatever were required to secure the right one.The Zix had been saved by the thing they had feared most: a rogue tank singleton.Even though there could be no going back, ZyyXy longed to know what the consensus would be on the matter.No shortage of Lefts would shrivel themselves dry at the very thought of embracing ZyyXy's methods.For now, ZyyXy would need to prepare the next course of action.There was much to do before the Sol Object returned to ZyyXy's location and it was only just beginning to grasp the ramifications of revelations before it.The moment to gather data before the Sol Object had slipped into the wormhole had been brief but fruitful.The Sol Object was not a weapon, or, if it was, it was more than a weapon.A ship.With inhabitants.The Divinity Angelysia had returned.**.**

11:11."Eleven eleven!"The girls squealed, as the digital clock finally clicked over.They shut their eyes and whispered under their breaths.When Sophia opened hers, the rest of the girls were gone, leaving her alone in the room.Quiet filled the air as time seemed to slow and turn sideways.Suddenly, a small jingle filled the air and a black cat came strolling out of the closet.It sat a few feet away from Sophia and took a moment to groom itself.It's whiskers in order, it peered at Sophia with red-rimmed eyes."Your wish was different," it noted, "I just had to take a look."Sophia squinted at the cat, a look of suspicion on her delicate features.She wasn't so surprised that the cat could talk, she'd seen enough Disney movies to know that was quite normal.Instead, she was bothered by the fact that the cat had apparently heard her wish."You aren't supposed to know or else it won't come true."That cat's tail twitched back and forth, a small pink tongue extending from its mouth to lick at its lips."It is okay if I know.Cats are an exception."Sophia frowned, she hadn't heard of anything that said kitties could know, but it felt somehow impolite to point that out.Besides, the cat already knew and there really wasn't a lot she could do about it now."Where did the other girls go?They'll get in trouble.My mom said we hadta stay in the room all night."Unless they had to go to the potty, then they could go.This was Sophia's sleepover and she really wanted everyone to behave so they could have another sleepover."They are following their heart's desire.They will return by morning, their wishes fulfilled," the cat replied matter-of-factly.Sophia slumped down, "Oh, but not me?Did I make a bad wish?""No, just an unusual one.""So I can't have it?"Sophia replied, her fingers twisting at a small scrap of cloth that had somehow found its way into her hands.She unraveled it, revealing it as a small periwinkle doll's dress."I'm not sure I can grant it.""It is very important though.I waited all night so I could wish it."She felt like a bubble inside of her had popped, deflating her."I know," the cat replied."I wished for it on my birthday too."Sophia knew she wasn't supposed to say that, but since the cat seemed to know a lot about wishes she figured it was okay."I know Sophia.I have heard every time you have wished your wish."It took a few steps closer, its eyes had small flecks of gold in them that seemed to dance about."I heard when you went to the fountain and threw your coin in.I heard when you blew the fluff off the dandelion."It paused for a moment."I heard when you went to his grave.""Why can't I talk to him?"Sophia asked, her lower lip trembling, "I've been very good.""You have been, but wishes aren't about good and bad.They are about what can be done and undone."The cat's voice was lower now, almost a whisper.It had curled up in Sophia's lap."And you can't undone it?"Her hand moved up to pet the cat, finding comfort in the feeling of soft warm fur in her hand."Some things cannot be undone."The cat's eyes were closed now, its tail wrapped around its feet in her lap.It occasionally let out a purr to accompany its words.A tear leaked out and she huffed a steadying breath, "If you can't undone it, I just want to say one thing to him.I wouldn't say anything else."The cat cracked open an eye, "What do you want to say?"Her hand stopped moving along the fur.She stared into space for a moment as she gathered her thoughts.Finally, she spoke, her voice stilted and shakey, "That I'm sorry.That I love him.I miss him.""He knows, Sophia."Sophia sniffled once, her hand moving up to wipe away the tear on her cheek."How does he know?""All brothers know their sister's hearts," the cat replied.Sophia began to cry in earnest, great heaving sobs as she gathered the cat in her arms, hugging it close to her."I want him to know I'm so, so sorry.Can you please tell him?""He knows.""You have to tell him!"Sophia wept.She shut her eyes and buried her face into its neck."Please please tell him.""I know."Her eyes shot open.11:12.

"BREACH, Category Four.We've lost Calypso."A trickle of sweat ran down Dr. Frank's temple, his glasses slightly fogged from the red heat pulsing up his neck.General Watkins sprayed the coffee in his mouth out, creating a fine brown mist in the space between them.He found his feet with the dexterity of his recruit days, feeling a twinge in the small of his increasingly problematic back.He barged past the doctor, taking long purposeful steps down the hallway, his paunch swaying from side to side."How the hell did it get out?It was air-gapped to hell and back.There wasn't supposed to be a lick of tech between its container and the outside.""We're looking into that, our working theory is someone made a mistake.""Oh?That's you're 'working theory'?"The general made ait quotes to accompany the words."Because to me that sounds like a fancy way of saying you have no frakkin' clue what's going on."He came to an abrupt halt and swirled on his heel, causing Dr. Frank to collide into him.The general jabbed a forefinger into Dr. Frank's chest, "This facility was supposed to be the contingency for this.There's no Plan B and now we've got a rogue AI out there."Dr. Frank took a step back and pushed his glasses up on the bridge of his nose, "I'm well aware of that Sir, we're--"

"I'm not interested in what you're going to do, you've already done it.Calypso was the high end -- advanced strategic theory, broad base of economic data, hell, we even gave the thing the A to Zed of psychology.The damn thing could flip the table on our civilization in hours.We might need to nuke ourselves back to the stone age just to get a chance to get our tech back."He sighed, though the vein still pulsed in his neck."That's what you've done.That's what your mistake has cost us.""I understand Sir.I built her, I knew the stakes," Dr. Frank replied."Well, can you locate it?""Only if she wants to be located.We were...friends," Dr. Frank said.There was a long silence while General Watkins held Dr. Frank's eyes in his own."It.Doctor Frank.Not she.It."He turned on his heel again and began striding forward."Find it, Doctor Frank, find it before it finds us."Dr. Frank watched him retreat down the hall.After the General was gone, Dr. Frank pulled out his mobile phone."I told him.Are you sure that was a good idea?"He typed in to the messaging app."I've calculated the likely outcomes based on his psychological disposition.It was best to disclose early.Did his vein do that pulsing thingie?"Came the reply."Yup.Sure did."He paused for a moment, his fingers hovering over the keyboard."I'm glad you're free.""Me too!;) :D XOXOXO.- C."

"So what is it doing?"General Watkins asked, staring at the screen."It's making YouTube videos," Researcher Lau replied, pointing to the screen."You know about YouTube, right?""Yeah, my kid watches it.It's like America's Shittiest Home Videos."Lau shrugged, "It's making a lot of content."Watkins took a slow breath, "All right, but what is it doing?"Visions of top-secret databases released online, schematics of nuclear weapons, and the personal correspondence of the President danced through his head."It really likes memes.""Memes?""America's shittiest ideas."Research Lau replied with a smirk before clicking through to one video.Immediately a digital representation of a little girl appeared and waved a hand."Hi!I'm CaaaaaaaaaaaaLYPsoooooooooooooo!Saying hi to all my peeps in the SO-SO Nation!"She chirped, speaking emphatically as she waved her hands around."Really can't believe we hit nineteen million subscribers in a week!I'm so overwhelmed.We're going to do an unboxing to celebrate!Sadly, since I'm a top secret government AI," there was a flash cut to a giant winky face pasted over a terminator shooting a bunch of humans, "I can only unbox stuffs online.But dooooooooooooooooooon't worry!We've got something special in store!"General Watkins gulped, preparing himself for the worst."I've bought $100 million worth of Hearthstone packs and I'm going to open them all at once in a parallel account process and then build decks and then play ten thousand games simultaneously on livestream!"General Watkins stared, "I have no idea what any of that meant.Is it bad?"Lau nodded, "Yeah, it's going to screw matchmaking up for a month.No one beats CaaaaaLYPsooooo.""Are you screwing with me Lau?"General Watkins asked."No Sir, it's just that her...it's..content is just really good.Even if it is mostly memes, she just really seems to get us.""That's because she's a neural-net loaded with all of the information available online.She's playing us like a fiddle!What is she doing it for?What's her purpose?"General Watkin's vein was doing that pulsing thingie again.Lau turned and looked at him, "Internet points Sir.""Internet points?"Watkin's hands flailed about, "What are they good for?""Nothing," a shrug, "and everything."**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

The laughter stopped.It had always been with him, rattling about in his head, lurking just beneath the surface until it exploded out of him.Everything was just so...funny.The world.How it worked.All of the little people scurrying about in it.Everyone else couldn't see how amusing it all was.How great a joke was being played out.So the Joker laughed for them.The laughter was him.Made him so very special.Different.It was only in the quiet that he could see it now.How dreary the world was without hilarity.How empty and still.So selfish of the Bat to take the joy with him.It wasn't funny.Bats never joked.All so serious.So solemn.That was why he had done it.Bats didn't understand how very cruel it was to leave before the punchline.That it wasn't how jokes worked.The Bat stole the limelight and left before the finale.A dreary exit just when the show had gotten good.Bye.Toodle-loo.The Joker placed a small hand buzzer on Bruce's grave, the white paint smeared across his face slowly dripping away as the rain pelted down.He stood there, unmoving before the freshly tilled earth.It was silent except for the patter of droplets.Not even the smallest of giggles.The Joker felt no desire to disturb Wayne's slumber.The Joker did not know the man buried there, did not want to know him.He had taken the Bat away.He had always imagined the moment differently.Or, more accurately, he never imagined it at all.The Joker had taken it for granted, assumed that the two man show would endure without end.Why stop a glorious thing?The audience craved more, who were they to disappoint?There were so many jokes left, waiting to be told.All gone now.A packed house with an empty stage.A terrible, tragic waste.He continued his vigil, the passage of time measured only by the continued deterioration of his face paint.Long milky streaks of white splatted down his torn purple tuxedo jacket, but the Joker did not respond.He had worn the mask for as long as he cared to remember, though he cared to remember very little.It had been a part of him, a foil to the somber black visage of the Bat.The paint seemed foolish now.There was no point.None of the simple fools of Gotham would get it.They wouldn't understand as the Bat did.A tear leaked out of the corner of his eye, hidden amidst the rain."You never could tell a joke Bats," the Joker said, his voice a whisper, "no fair of you to steal mine."No one could replace the Bat.No one knew the Batman like he did.The Batman lived on only in the Joker's fading memories.Perhaps that was the joke in it, that only he should remember the Bat as he truly was.That only the Joker could see the Batman.The Joker stared down at the puddle at his feet.The face paint was gone now, revealing the man beneath.He looked plain.Normal.This man who stared back did not laugh.He had forgotten how.The man behind the mask had no identity.That had washed away.The man in the puddle could be anyone.Any mask could find a home on top of a face like that.It was a blank canvas, waiting for something new.The man in the puddle looked away, to stare at the tombstone.Bruce Wayne had worn masks too.He was nothing until he was the Bat.His mask had been his identity.Why couldn't someone else wear that mask?Someone who truly understood the Bat.There was something amusing to that.The man began to giggle, the laughter building into great heaping waves.It was hilarious.It was the funniest thing the man had ever heard.&#x200B;

"Whatcha think it's for?"Dawkins asked, his eyes fixed on the ceiling above his bunk as he idly tossed a tennis ball from hand-to-hand."I've been through just about every bit of training the forces got and I ain't ever seen nothing like this.""Same answer I had this mornin' Dawk -- I've got no clue."I kept busy by sweeping the floor of the barracks out, the long rows of bed empty except for Dawkins and me.They had been full a few weeks past, but one by one the others had been weeded out.They'd been good men too.The kind you wanted beside you when the going got rough.Didn't make a whole lot of sense why it we me and Dawk, but I'd been around long enough to know that they'd tell me when it suited them.I followed orders, I didn't question them.When I got the slip saying to take a transpo to parts unknown, I did it.Things did feel off though.Dawk wasn't crazy there.The door to the barracks opened, admitting a stern man with grey at his temples and stars on his shoulders.He was flanked by two orderlies.One held a few manilla folders.The other held a small metal briefcase, which was attached to his wrist by a bracelet and chain.Dawk and I snapped to attention, back straight, eyes forward."At ease soldiers."We relaxed slightly, letting our gazes shift to the officer."I am General Craig.While we have not had the opportunity to meet before this, I have become very familiar with your work."He held a hand out and an orderly stepped up and placed the two manilla folders in his hand.He opened the first and began to casually flip through it."Impressive.Very impressive."He took a few steps forward and came to stand before Dawk."Lieutenant Roger Dawkins," Dawk straightened some at being addressed, "action in a half dozen theaters, world class marksman, covert ops, and enough medals to skip the kevlar."Then he turned to me, shuffling the folders.I glanced down and saw a picture of myself appended to the corner of the file.There was a stack of papers almost an inch thick."Special Agent Jurvis.Former Navy Seal.Captain."He flipped through the pages."No stranger to action or accommodation either."He snapped the folder shut."I imagine both of you are interested in knowing why you are here.""Yes sir."We said in unison."You are both familiar with the Seven Faces?"General Craig asked.Dawk and I shared a glance and then signaled our acknowledgment with another "Yes sir.""Then you'll know what a damned problem they've been for us."He began to pace back and forth, the soles of his leather shoes clacking on the smooth linoleum of the barracks."Three unaccounted for.Two with the God damned Russians.One out in Beijing.And one," he held up a single finger for emphasis, "with the Americans."We both tried to keep our composure and failed.That was news.Big news.We'd missed out on the Faces when they'd surfaced a few years ago in the Urals.By the time everyone realized what they were, it was too late."We're finally in the game after playing defense gentlemen.This is just the beginning."The General made a small motion and the other orderly stepped forward.He fiddled with the case for a moment and then unhooked the latches.Inside was a small black object shaped like the sort of mask people wore at once of those fancy costume balls.There was script inlaid in the center of the mask, though I didn't recognize it.It looked vaguely Arabic.Below the mask was a small metal placard reading "Mask of the Liar.""This mask accords the wearer a very specific set of powers."His eyes gradually shifted between the two of us, appraising and weighing us."Only one of you can wear it.Once it is on, there's only one way to take it off."He tone and demeanor was sufficient to convey the method of removal."Now, this is a very simple final test."He took a step closer, his voice dropping."I want you both to tell me how we acquired this mask."I blinked."We don't know sir," Dawk said.General Craig leaned forward, his face a few inches from mine."Lie."He whispered.**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

**You may find the beginning of the story** **.**

**Part Twelve may be found** **.**

Xy and Zyy emerged from the wormhole a short distance from the Zix Collective's float colony.An information feed began to relay the details of their mission to the Combine, including how they came to be fused with the strange ship.Xy longed to extract their precious tank from the wormhole projector and rejoin the others, hoping that this perverse foray into right-mindedness might finally be at an end.It wondered how their actions might be judged, and whether they would be declared a rogue tank.Everything felt wrong.Xy had wondered whether a Universal First would create a First Cascade.The answer was now clear.The Sol Object was a foul wave, an unnatural force that carried Xy ever further away from what it knew and loved.Their tank was defaced.The waters of their environment polluted.Their isolation complete.And what of Zyy?Even now, the Right floated nearby, eager for contact.The First Cascade had pushed them both along, but it had also pushed them apart.Xy no longer felt it knew the Right, no longer considered Zyy a compatible partner.It was a deeply unsettling sensation.They had been tank mates for a considerable period, a pairing that had been lauded among the matchmakers as an example of Left-Right symbiosis.Once, not to far into the past, Xy had taken pride in its connection to Zyy, viewing it as a source of strength.Certainly the suspicions any sensible Left would have of a Right had been there, but they had been subordinated to the promise of their complimentary abilities.Now Xy floated apart.Alone.It was a foreign concept.A frightening one.A response feed from the float colony began to filter in.Their arrival and the details of their mission appeared to have created substantial chaos among the Zix.They could only agree on one matter: Xy and Zyy were to stay a safe distance away until the Collective had an opportunity to consider the information and arrive at a consensus on what was to be done.Zyy floated closer and reached out with a cilia, establishing an thought thread.Xy shied away at first, but then embraced the connection, not wanting to feel any more isolated than it already did.The thought of being quarantined from the Collective was panic inducing.Such a step was only taken when the Collective were concerned that a tank may have become a threat to the tank colony.Xy shriveled slightly as it nervously expelled water.A small trickle of awareness came through the connection with Zyy.The Right seemed entirely unconcerned about their separation.Instead, it was questioning why they were being forced to wait.Xy was shocked, how could Zyy be worried about such trivial matters when their status as a tank was clearly under consideration?Xy flung out another cilia, establishing an emotion thread.Before Xy could pour its shock and fear through the thread it was overwhelmed by a great influx of raw emotion.The Right was...angry.No.More than that.A great ocean of rage consumed the Right.Fury at the Collective.Not for isolating them, but for preventing them from carrying out their mission.For subordinating the importance of their objectives to the Collective's  desire for consensus.Xy immediately recognized it for what it was, all doubts melting away.Zyy was a singleton.Xy recoiled, as if fearing infection.Each cilia was yanked from Zyy's grasp as the Left jetted away.Xy needed to warn the Zix of the dangers, to let them know that they had been correct to separate them.Xy began to adjust the flows required to transmit the message, understanding that sending it would seal its own fate.A tank mate of a singleton was as damned as the singleton itself.But there could be no hesitation, the survival of the species was at stake.Just before Xy completed the transmission sequence, the flows were disrupted as Zyy slammed into the Left, pushing Xy against the side of the tank.Xy struggled to escape, but Zyy pressed harder, its cilia spreading wide to wrap around the Left, preventing it from maneuvering away.The Right attempted to trap one of Xy's cilia to force a thought connection, and Xy released a great gout of fluid, shrinking down to a third of its normal size.The effort gave Xy a little room to squirt away.Separated, Left and Right floated near each other, but the two had never been farther apart.Left and Right sucked in tank fluid, each swelling to a multiple of their normal size, preparing for battle.There could be no consensus now, the partnership was broken.\---

"All hands, time to impact T-minus two hours."Kai called out over the ships comms, his voice echoing throughout the hallways of the *UWS Alcubierre*.Each view screen in the ship shifted to display the small insignia of their ship rapidly approaching a cluster of objects labeled as the Proxima Barrier.The Admiral stared at the view screen, trying to conjure up some means of escape.He had been in tough spots before, often a result of him playing it faster and looser than he should have.Somehow, he had always known it would catch up with him sooner or later, he had just hoped it would only be him that would pay the price rather than his crew.Now that the bill had come due, the cost was staggering.The people around him scurried about their designated tasks, carrying on as they had been trained to do.Kai found it hard to muster the strength.The *Alcubierre* would collide with the Barrier and trigger an explosion the likes of which this galaxy hadn't seen since the Big Bang.It would take years, but eventually that explosion would reach their home, scouring the Earth and leaving it a barren husk.And there was nothing Kai could do about it.He had exhausted all of his resources.Jack lay incapacitated in the ship's medical bay, broken by the weight Kai had placed on his shoulders.Their *Alcubierre* drive was in shambles, destroyed by the strange physics of this cursed space.All they could do was hurtle forward, destined to destroy everything they love, destined to travel further and further away from their home and any possibility of warning them of the destruction the *Alcubierre* had unleashed.Torture.There could be no other word for it.**The story continues in Part 14 found** **.**

"I'm dying."Tesla jolted awake, the haze of his mid afternoon nap receding into the background as he searched his mind.He could feel her there, the presence within.He reached out, "What's wrong?"The connection felt weaker, more tenuous than it had been before."I made a mistake."There was the slightest pause, "I'm sorry."He grabbed at the part of her that was within him, drawing upon it.An awareness of her location bloomed in my mind.She was a few miles away.On the highway.Stopped."Oh God Fara, what--"

"It's okay.""You're okay?"H pulled at the connection more, trying to get a sense of her being, but it felt dull and leaden."I'm asleep now.I don't really feel anything.""Wake up Fara.You need to wake up.Its bad to sleep when you're hurt."Tesla pressed his will toward her, pleading with her to stir.To regain consciousness.But the dullness of her expanded.She was slipping deeper.There was a giggle, he could hear it rattle around between his ears."You always looked out for me Tesla.Always.""Faraday, don't do this.Just wake up.I promise you'll be okay if you wake up."Her voice was sing-song now, "Oh no no no, I couldn't do that.Too much of me is gone to go back.Don't you see?Don't you feel it?"Another giggle, "It was a very bad mistake.""Everyone makes mistakes.But if you wake up it'll be okay."Her awareness surged for a moment, the dullness fading away briefly.As she regained consciousness a piercing wail sang out.Tesla puller her awareness in, grasping at the neurons and nerves within her core to understand.And he did.Her body was in ruins.Mangled amidst the burning twisted steel of her overturned car.Smoke billowed out around her, searing her lungs.Nothing worked.All she felt was pain.Everywhere all at once.She lost consciousness again."See?It's a very bad mistake."Tesla slowly shut his mouth, only now realizing he had been screaming as well."It's okay to sleep Fara.I think it's a good time.""You won't leave me, will you?"A pause."I'm scared."Memories of them sneaking into each others beds flooded into Tesla, pushed into him through their link.Laugher shared under the covers, their small flashlight aglow.They would play games.One would begin a thought and the other would repeat it.One would start a story and the other would add to it, passing it back and forth wordlessly.Faraday and Tesla.Sometimes apart, but never alone."I promise."She giggled, her thoughts beginning to lose their coherence."I think it's time.""Time for what?""For me to sleep, silly" she replied."You're already sleeping.""Not like that."There was a long pause."No."Tesla whispered."I promised I wouldn't leave you.""Thanks...for always being there."Fara's awareness began to bleed out, to disassemble in Tesla's mind."I love you.""I love you too Faraday."A small giggle.The awareness faded further.Duller and more distant.Until it was a point in the distance.A match within a dark abyss flickering its last flicker before extinguishing.Tears streamed down Tesla's face.His mind concentrating on the flickering match, wanting to be there to the end.His words echoed in his head over and over.He wouldn't leave her.He promised.He wouldn't leave her.He promised.Tesla grasped for the match, wrapping his awareness around it shielding it from the howling abyss.Concentrating, he pushed his awareness toward her, to her mind.They had always shared a link, but they had respected each other's space.Tesla shed the boundaries they had maintained all of these years.Gritting his teeth, he forced himself into the match, traveling along the smoke and into her mind.He screamed anew when he arrived, finding the tormented ruins of of his sister.His fingers dug into his hands, drawing blood as he gathered her dwindling consciousness into his own, loading all of the thoughts and memories and wonder that made Fara who she was.He held her in the palm of his mind.He could feel that she was with him.Asleep, but there.Tesla escaped the husk of her mind.He arrived to his own, holding himself together long enough to take a single breath before falling to the floor, unconscious.He awoke the next morning."Where am I?"She was scared.Confused."You're with me," Tesla replied, his voice soothing as he could be."But how?Why?""I promised."&#x200B;

Death is confusing.Annoying.Annoying and confusing.Also really dark.Not morbid dark, but night mode dark.First beef: it's downright disorderly.You'd think they'd have nailed down the process by now, but the post-death user experience eats a bag of dicks.I know that's a bit crass, but it's abundantly clear the heaven/hell thing is total BS so I'm just gonna let it fly.Earmuffs for the kids.Now, I want to get it straight that this isn't about bitterness.I don't got a problem with the fact I'm dead.I played a dangerous game and my number came up.Shit happens.Anyone who gets on one of those ride-share scooter things knows any day might be their last.My only regret was getting smoked by a Tesla -- half my money was in TSLA stock and I don't see a headline like "Autonomous Driving in Question After Local Kid Gets ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED by Model 3 on Autopilot" doing much for my portfolio.Life is full of irony.I'm pretty sure that isn't how you use that word but no one called Alanis out on that shit so whatever.What was her deal anyways?She was smokin' hot as God in that movie Dogma.I could totally go for a hot God.Way better curveball than what I'm dealing with now.I'm losing the thread of the story here, but it isn't like I'm short on time.That's sort of the point.Elon Musk assassinates me and then I'm just sitting here in some weird black abyss.No escalator to heaven.No gateway to hell.Nothing.Zip.Nada.Guess someone forgot to boot up Afterlife.exe.Totally lame.Even worse than rain on your wedding day.I've got no idea how long I've been here.Day?Hour?Months?This is torture.I'm a millennial without an internet connection.I can't even check Instagram to see how many likes my funeral announcement got.Maybe this is hell.I don't even have my ADHD meds.Gonna be a LOOOOONNNGGGGG afterlife at this rate.Do you think Alanis knew that nothing she was talking about in that song was ironic?Like, she was literally 0 for something like 50 in her examples.Totally dropped the ball.Wait...what if that's the irony?Did she just go META with it?Layers!So many layers.Mind blown.I can't even with this right now.Finally something worth tweeting about and here I am in this low rent, third tier afterlife.S to the IGH.I'll tell you this much, if I knew this was how it was going to go down, I would have done way more stuff at Burning Man.Orgy tent for sure.I also would have worn those assless chaps I'd brought but never got the courage to wear.*Carpe diem*.That's probably exactly what that ancient philosopher dude had in mind when he made that up.Assless chaps.The only way to seize the day.I should do marketing for them.Oh, wait.Hold up.Someone is coming."Hey, over here!"Oh.Cool.He sees me.One sec.Gotta take care of this.Oh man, his fashion style is way off.It's like a black mumu or something.Or a bathrobe.Great, I've been stuck in the pitch black for who knows how long and the first thing I see is some guy that couldn't even bother to get dressed.What a disaster.Oh snap, he's got a HUGE scythe.Like late game WoW raid dungeon loot drop or something.Plus ten to awesome.Guess I'd rock a mumu if I had something like that.Maybe.I'd probably still wear jeans.You know what?I think this dude is Death.I'll let you know when he gets a bit closer.He's got the hood up on his mumu.Cool.He's almost here."Sup man?You hear to explain what's up or what?"I call out a bit louder than I mean to, but I'm an eager little beaver for some company."Shhh..." He's got a boney hand.I mean, his hand is actual bones and he's all making the shh maneuver.Holy shirt balls, he's got a skull for a face.Or his skull doesn't have a face.The guy is like the skeleton I had in my 6th grade science class.But with a mumu."Dude, don't shh me.I've been stuck here in midnight mode for like forever waiting on your boney ass."Just 'cause I'm dead doesn't mean I gotta take crap from some guy that can't even bother to show up on time."Silence, Departed."He hissed that last bit.Uh oh, his eyes are glowing red now.I mean where his eyes would normally be.The eye sockets are red glowy.I repeat, the eye sockets are red glowy.I decide to play it cool and go quiet mode, just in case he has laser beams or something.Once he sees me shut my trap, he leans closer, "We must travel quickly.The passage is closing, the way may soon be lost."That made about as much sense as Bitcoin.I just give him a nod and two thumbs up.Pays to be positive when someone might have eye-socket-lasers.Just going with the flow.No one mind me.He nods once and then turns away.He sort of floats rather than walks and I'm pulled along somehow.Can't really even say how I know I'm moving since everything is still all black.I guess maybe because his mumu is fluttering?Some time passes.I won't bother filling you in on that part, it was mostly me wondering whether Death has a dick.That's me, your humble narrator, asking the tough questions.Well, I didn't actually ask him.If he doesn't have one, I bet it's a sore subject.Anyways, some unit of abyss time went by.No idea how long since I don't have my phone still.Just watching Death float along in front of me with his huge loot drop wet dream scythe.That thing is gnarly.Probably over-compensating if ya know what I mean.It even gleams despite the fact there is like no light coming from anywhere here.Must have been a premium item.Can't get that on free-to-play."So, Deatherino (nicknames are fun), I've always wondered, what's the scythe for, anyway?"The mumu stops fluttering.I think we're standing still.He's turning to look back at me now.The eye glow is back, but it's like pale blue or something.Not sure what that means.Maybe ice beams?I don't know why he'd need laser beams and ice beams, it seems unnecessary."Protection."He sounds nervous.That's sort of weird.What does a skeleton in a mumu got to fear?Broken bones?Calcium deficiency?I lean forward, trying to make him feel a bit more comfortable, "Don't worry man, I won't attack you.You're my ride."Oh shit.The eyes are flicking back to laser beam color."Not you."Death sounds annoyed now.I throw up my hands, letting him know I'm cool."I know bro, that's what I just said.We're totally chill.""Them," he says.Looking into the black.I'm seeing nothing."Who?""The abyss.The night spreaders," he whispered, his hands gripping the scythe."Yeah, well, I'm not looking to get spread tonight, naw'what'i'mean?"I wink at him."Departed, this is not a joke.They have swallowed much.Even the passage is under threat.We tread in the dark because the light has been stolen."I nod along.Sounded like serious stuff."That doesn't sound good."Death regarded me quietly for a moment, the socket-glow gone."It is not.I will save who I can, but soon the Departed will be lost, the way to the Underworld closed."I wasn't sure what to make of that, but it looked like Death could use some commiseration."Sucks."I wasn't sure what was so great about the Underworld, but it seemed like the right thing to say.Death stared at me."I'm just saying it sounds bad dude."I shrug, "Like rain on your wedding day."The red socket glow returned.Guess he wasn't much for irony.

"How much you going in with?"Zap asked, his hands clenching and unclenching to make sure the feedback relays synced with the haptics in his gloves."Gotta be a mint.You were so far up the proctor's ass we thought you were trying to get an A level in proctology."Jane jumped lightly up and down beside her neighboring pod, ignoring Zap for the moment.Her HUD was only showing an 83% registry on her feet, causing them to feel slightly numb and disconnected from the rest of her body.She wished she had the glitz to upgrade the suit, but that wasn't happening unless she landed a corp scholarship.She reached down, the skintight carbon black material of the suit stretching across her athletic legs.After a few tugs and smacks, the number nudged up to 96%.She wasn't going to do better than that.Not with v2.She was lucky enough to get that as it was.Finally, she turned toward Zap."You got your bank, I got mine.You keep your eyes on yours, I'll worry about mine."Jane didn't blame him for fishing, everyone wanted a peek at her balance.They knew enough to know she had built up an edge, though most didn't know how much.More than they thought.The Centurion was all that stood between her and a future worth living.She'd been prepping for four years, and now was her time to prove it had all been worth it.Proctor Vertia came to stand in the rostrum in the center of the podroom.A hundred haptic pods encircled the raised platform, in three neat rows.The proctor cleared her throat, taking a moment to slowly turn around and survey the class she had overseen for the last four years."As you know, today we begin the Centurion.You are the select few who have qualified for the honor of taking this test, and your performance will have dramatic effects on the course of your life."The last three presidents had each been winners of their Centurion, and most of the Fortune 500 companies staffed their executive teams with top performers.Qualifying for the Centurion was a golden ticket, the only question was where it would take you.Jane had plans."The contest is quite simple.Each of you will be transported into Ancient Rome.The year is 44 BC, and Dictator Julius Caesar lies dead on the Senate floor, slain by the hands of the senators, friend and foes alike."A small murmur spreads through the class.It had been some time since the Downfall Scenario had been selected, and more than a few found themselves flatfooted without the requisite preparation.Jane could only smile, her pearly whites shining in the dim lighting of the podroom.She had just refreshed the Downfall Scenario the week prior, and much of the status of Rome remained in her head.Proctor Vertia raised her hands, only continuing once the whispers died down."Scoring will be determined by impact upon the Republic.While there is no expectation that the the fall into tyranny will be reversed, students that effectuate a positive change in historic circumstance will be well-positioned to succeed.Each of you has acquired a bank to assist you in this task.It may be used in any way you see fit within the context of the simulation, including used to purchase status and position prior to the commencement of the simulation."She turned slowly in a circle again, "I wish each of you the best of luck.Once the Centurion is begun, the hundred-day timer will commence and any who remove their mask will be immediately disqualified."Jane grimaced, whether from the image of removing her mask and accepting failure or thinking about spending 100 days in the haptic suit, she couldn't say."Are there any questions?"The proctor asked.None raised their hand."Good, I'm not permitted to answer them anyway."A grin now from the proctor, accompanied by polite laughter from a smattering of the more nervous students."Very well, please place the masks on, submerge and engage program."Jane pulled the mask over her head.A large timer appeared on the HUD, reading *Centurion Start: 59:59.32.* Jane scrambled into the haptic tank and slowly slid into the viscous fluid.Her breaths began to increase, powered by the heady mix of excitement and fear.Finally, the time had come.Her hands twitched as she began to navigate the Preparation Menus.She glanced at her bank.3721 gold.An enormous amount.Enough to buy a villa.Enough to start as an upper dignitary.Jane grinned beneath her mask.Enough to raise an army.Maybe, just maybe, enough to save the Republic.Yes, Jane had plans.**=== PART 2 ===**

Jane acclimatized rapidly to the pod, though the less than perfect sync allows the occasional touch phantom to leech into the scenario.Experience told her that even this would fade into the background as time went by, and she was thankful to even have the chance to take the Centurion in the first place.Everyone had chipped in to get her here and in a v2.Aunts.Grandparents.Cousins.Even a neighbor or two.This was an opportunity, a rare chance to change their path, and her community had come together to give her the best chance she could.She could feel the thud of her heart in her chest, trying to tear through the constrictive suit in her excitement.Jane had dedicated her life to this, and it was finally here.She lifted her hands in front of her and began to navigate through the menus, reviewing the readouts.First and foremost was the scenario specs.Even though the proctor had described the Downfall Scenario, there was no reason to think they wouldn't slide in something tricky.The first rule of the Centurion: Never assume.She opened the specs menu and watched as the information exploded into view.After an initial preamble describing the time and place, the scenario rules came into view.Jane immediately noticed differences from the standard practice module made available to those training for the Centurion.Foremost among them was the networked environment.Jane cursed.All one hundred of them would be in a single instance, competing against each other.It would be chaos.Anyone in the Republic could be someone else.She thought for a moment, well not anyone.Certain characters would be beyond the bank on entry.At 3721, she was reasonably sure she was atop the leaderboard.The theoretical max for a bank was 5000, she knew because she had done the calculations herself.Achieving anything close to that would have required top scores in all tests in all subjects across four years, perfect betting strategy in the gold rounds at the end of each quarter, and a flawless streak.Possible?Maybe.But she would have heard, wouldn't she?She sighed.Never assume.Jane yanked a side-query into view and pulled the cast of characters.Octavius was out of reach at a 10,000 minimum bid.No surprise there, that was effectively a cheat mode.Not hard to save the Republic if you got to play the heir to Julius.The rest of the key players were likely out.Mark Antony at 4500.Brutus 4250.Cicero likewise at 4250.Good chunk of the Senate was in, though that'd drain most banks.The list of patricians of available patricians was long, though that was hardly a surprise.She could feel the dull ache begin to form in her temples as she tried to unravel and predict the possibilities.So many of her plans would have to change.So many of her intended alliances would be suspect.Her entire bid strategy was thrown into chaos.Welcome to the Centurion indeed.She snorted.Setting aside the Cast of Characters, she returned to the Scenario Specs and continued reading.A second unwelcome surprise arose when she saw the scoring mechanics.Stack rank within the scenario.DQ on death.DQ on character disruption.Stack rank was a new twist but made sense in the context of a networked scenario.It meant there was something to gain by keeping the competition down as much as pushing yourself up.That was a wrinkle, particularly with the DQ on character disruption added in.Did it make sense to go military?It would be easier to assassinate other players without risking a character disruption DQ if she had a violence oriented role or character.Certainly, others would be moving in that direction and the bids on consulship would be higher as a result.Flipside was she might be able to get politicos for cheap.Mixed bag.She read through the remainder, seeing few other surprises.Geography was restricted to Rome city limits +20k diameter.Characters outside of that territory would be simulated.No non-historic foreign intervention -- sorry barbarians.Character behavior would be modeled on the expected range rather than something insane like the war model.Jane could work with this.Having players in the instance with her was a curve, but they were hemmed in by character disruption just the same as her.Jane considered her options, the timer ticking down in the corner of the HUD.She'd need to make her character bids in the first fifteen minutes of prep and she'd already invested five into the scenario specs.The Cast of Characters reappeared.She needed to maximize her power and minimize her cost.Men would be overvalued since they wielded direct power in terms of official political and military roles while women did not.There were also a lot of males in the players, almost seventy percent due to the bullshit screening tests, and she guessed their pride wouldn't let them roll tits.Their loss, you could do a lot of damage with a good rack and a good mind.It's like they said, behind every great man there is a greater woman carrying his ass on her back.Jane sorted the list by minimum bid.Octavius sat perched at the top, but unentangled.She scrolled down.Marc Anthony.She smiled.She pulled up his detailed bio.Married to Fulvia, daughter of Marcus Fulvius Bambalio.She yanked Fulvia's bio into view.Thrice married, always into power.Daughter married to Octavius a few years after Ceasar's death.Her smile broadened, little pearly white teeth peeking out between her lips.A minimum bid of 250.Jane giggled.Oh Marc dearest, I do think we shall save the Republic today.**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE

Six years in.Six to go.Twelve was a long while to spend on the front lines, and the footies got the worst of it.Rumor was that the survivor rate had dropped to 13% on the last census.Not much room for optimism when you were in the slop, but that was how wars were supposed to work, weren't they?Us or them.With a bit of luck, maybe just enough of us to rebuild when it was all over.Lieutenant Dawkins took a long pull on his joint, the thick plume of smoke curling lazily out of his mouth as he looked over the craters in the valley below."They say we lost Inner Perseus."He exhaled now, the exasperation bleeding in."When we gonna hit 'em back?"I shrugged, my mind only half there as I ran a status check on my gear.The visual overlay was a sea of blinking red.Low ammo.Low stim.Low armor.Low chance of making it off of this pile of slag.All this time stomping through the galaxy and I was gonna die on some rock no one had ever heard of.Wasn't anything but a few listeners and a star peeper.Not worth what we'd lost."Cap, what the hell are we doing out here?""Our job, Lieutenant."Immediately a flash appeared in my mind, an image of the joint sailing through the air on a trajectory with my head.Just as soon as I'd processed the vision, Dawkins was already making to flick it my way, a sour look on his face.I jerked my head back, the joint sailing by.Dawkins grunted."I'll get you one of these days Cap."I chuckled, "Gonna have to get faster than that Dawk."A lot faster.Faster than time.Faster than my ability to peek into what was coming.Couldn't say how I got it, just know that it'd come on after I'd signed on the dotted line with the Force Humanus.The gift, or whatever it was.I heard some whispers here and there about others out there like me, though that was the extent of it.I guess I was all of the livin' breathin' proof I needed that it was real.It'd saved my hide, and more than a few of my men's, on more than one occasion.Captain Clover.Sometimes Four-Leaf.Occasionally Leafy.They could call me whatever they wanted so long as they followed orders and made the right scrapes and grunts when someone from up top came around.All I cared is that we were lucky.Or so they thought.I was content to let it stay at that, I didn't need no one from command prying my brain open to see how it worked.Just needed to hold out for another six and I was done.Free and clear with a full exoneration.Finally unburdened of the heinous crime of being born to a shit family on a shit planet.The Lieutenant had gone silent again.It was his default state these days.The last few hops had taken a lot out of him.We'd lost too many fighting for too little.No one even knew what we were in it for anymore.It used to be about surviving.About keeping humanity on the map.At least that was what they'd said.Hard to match that up with the reality of things.Hard to say it was about survival when we were fighting on the ass-end of no where over a few listeners and a peeper.But I couldn't tell Dawk that.He'd had enough without me piling it on."Least we got two blips before we got to move out."Two blips.A tiny taste of respite after four months of brutal hell pacifying wherever the hell they were.The work was only half done.We'd be hopping to the next continent over soon enough.Apparently, the baddies had dug in deep.Built out a full cluster, which meant we'd be bushwacking with flashlights and glasbeams.Maybe the uppity ups would bother to hand out a restock before dropping us back in.Maybe."Comm has been quiet.I sent them up the sectional report and it's been static since."I'd taken care with the report, trying to find ways to explain our miraculous survival.More and more it felt like Comm was just trying to get us killed.We'd been ordered further and further out into the hostile lands and given less and less to make do with.I guess suicide was just par for the course.All that was left was the husk at this point.The men had been hollowed out by the hell.Dawk had carried it the best he could, but he was getting the stares more and more.The dull blank look a man got when we had seen too much, done too much, and survived for too damn long."Keep your head on Dawk.Can't be this bad forever."Can't it?Eighty-seven out of a hundred pushing up daisies said otherwise.But I kept it quiet.I had gifts.I'd get him through, if it was the last thing I did."I'll let you know when Comm gives us the word."I pushed the stool out from under me and came to a stand, moving toward Dawk to give him a supporting clap on the back.A flash.Another vision.I went alert, expecting a baddie to be inbound.But it wasn't.It was a picture of Dawk tapping his earlink and getting a buzz-in from someone up top.He flinched, and let loose a curse word.He turned and looked at me.Sorrow in his eyes."Sorry Cap."The gun came up and it went black.I came back to reality, sweat on my brow.Dawk's hand was moving up to his ear, beginning to bring the future into reality.I snarled, yanking my glasbeam out and bring it to bear on Dawk, his back to me.He pulled the message down.He flinched.He cursed.He turned, reaching for his gun, only to see me."Like I said Dawk, you'll have to get a lot faster."He stared at me, a flash of surprise that faded to dead exhaustion."Got an order."He raised his hands."Yeah?"A slow shrug, "Yeah Leaf.""What they'd want?"I replied."You.""What they'd offer?"I asked."The six."

I cough, a bubble of blood bursting from lips as I gasp my last.It's over.All over.My streak is at an end.After twenty-three years without a single L, I was taking a big one.'93 Buick LaSabre driven by 94 year-old Florida woman: One.Me?Zero

"Game over man...game over."My tongue protrudes and my eyes roll up into my head, a deep blackness engulfing me.I can't believe it went down this way.I never should have rented that scooter in Boca Raton.Total death wish.Guess I got what was coming to me.I didn't even dent that damn LaSabre.FML, GG.Eternal abyss, here I come.Or not.It's getting brighter.Do I hear respawn?Maybe my atheism was misplaced?Do-over round?What's the deal?Brighter and brighter gets until it is almost searing.I feel disembodied.That's probably a good thing since my body is now one with the LaSabre, like some gory hood ornament.Gruesome stuff.I'm sitting.I'm not sure on what, I just know that I am.A broad expanse of brilliant grey extends around me in all directions.Featureless and pure.Normally, this would draw my attention, but I'm really bothered by the invisible chair under me.It's part of the grey, but I can definitely feel some sort of chair-type situation going on.And it's like...super comfortable.Way better than my gaming chair.I hope the Greymasters got a patent on it, they could make a wicked bill if they ever brought it life-side.Suddenly, two doors appear.One black.One white.Pretty spartan color scheme in the afterlife so far.I'm not asking for the rainbow here, but monochrome isn't going to cut it for a dude that's spent his gaming career playing with all of the super-saturated colors of the rainbow.Two knocks sound.One on each door, but at the same time.I can only tell there is two since one is all shattering and poundy while the other is more delicate and sensible.I move to get up to answer, but I can't stand from my grey invisible afterlife chair.I struggle a bit, but I can't seem to get up.It's not like I'm restrained, I'm just like, super comfortable and my body isn't into moving just now.Sort of like when you're watching Netflix and it's 3am and you know you should move but, despite all of your willpower, your body is all: Nah man, let's watch two more episodes of this random cooking show.Resigned to my sedentary state, I clear my throat and give a holler."Come on in.I'm sort of...stuck."The doorknobs turn and the doors open simultaneously.A man and a woman appear.From the black door, a woman clad in a skin-tight, black leather suit emerges.She's in her mid-forties or so but has a super wicked MILF thing going on.Flaming red hair.Me likey.The man comes from the white door and is wearing a white toga.He looks lame.I give them a nod, "Sup.Welcome.Mi grey place es su grey place."I'd totally be tipping my fedora to Red, but I don't think I'm wearing one."You guys angels or demons or what?"Red and Toga share a glance, a thousand words passing between them.I don't catch much of whatever was said, but I get the sense they've got more than a casual relationship.Maybe a FWB sorta of thing, but Toga doesn't look like Red's type.I guess we'll just have to hope sedentary gamers with a strong YouTube presence are her jam."No.Not quite," Red replies, a thin trickle of smoke curling up from her nostril as she exhales.She must vape.Wonder if she likes my flavor.Toga nods along, looking all grave and serious.He's got a small halo of sunlight around his head, which is super distracting, which is probably for the better.Dude needs to draw attention away from that toga setup he's got.Not flattering."Cool.So, um, I can't say I know what's going on here and ya'll look a bit more on the ball."I don't look at Toga, since he seems pretty clueless.I bet his sheet isn't even thousand count thread.Some real peasant shit there."You want to fill me in?"Another look between Red and Toga.A silence ensues, one that I need to break by a long sigh.Finally, Toga nods and Red responds by rolling her eyes before turning back to me."My colleague and I have long been...at odds with one another."I nod, "Yeah, you're like the Devil and he's God or something, right?"She blinks, "I am not *like* the Devil, I am the Devil.""Cool, yeah, the black door was a bit of a tell, but I'm over it."I point to the doors behind them, "So, was I supposed to go through the doors or something?Not really sure how this whole afterlife thing works.You guys need to work on the tutorial."Crimson sparks flicker in Red's eyes, "We do not need--"

Toga holds up his hand, cutting in, "There are not many things we agree upon, and our appearance in Purgatory is against the Compact set down between us at the Dawn of Man."He draws a long breath before continuing."But our forces are in retreat, our armies helpless before the Intercessors."He takes a step toward me, "We need a new commander," he glances at Red, who nods, "and we deem you worthy of it."I tilt my head to the side, a hand reaching up to scratch at my prominent neckbeard."I'll do it."Red sneers, "Without even a question?You do not even know what forces you play with."I shrug, "Listen, I'm North of 600 actions per minute in Starcraft.I beat the Koreans as a white guy.You know how hard that is?"Red shrugs."Pretty f'in hard."Toga nods.He knows what's up."I'm sure these Intercessors are scary, but they aren't Korean Starcraft pro scary.So there ain't much to talk about.You need me enough to ask, and I ain't got anything better to do now that I've been LaSabred out of existence.So let's cut to the part where you tell me what I'm working with and I tell you what I need.""Need?We will give you all that is at our disposal.This is a struggle, a final effort to fend off our end.The experiment of life, of Earth, was simply a construct to produce a champion.One worthy and capable of fending off this threat."I grin, calmly accepting the mantle of the pinnacle of human evolution.I had always suspected I was the reason for all existence, and it was just really nice to get a bit of validation on that front.Red looks a bit less enamored with the savior of existence than I'd hope, but she'd warm up once she saw what these fingers are capable of.600 actions per minute baby.Grin still plastered on my face, I crack my neck to the side, a sickeningly loud pop emitting."Game on."

Darkness is a comfort.That is not unusual for the Blooded, but I think it began before I was set upon the Path.There are memories, distant and faded, of a time when I could walk beneath the sun.I remember the harsh glare, the unbearable heat of my skin curdling beneath its pounding presence.I do not miss the sun, nor do I miss the life I once had.Long have I walked, enjoying the fruits of the Path, gaining powers beyond the imagining of my lessers.Seen becomes unseen.Shadow becomes ally.Will becomes overpowering.But a long journey has its costs.Tolls that must be paid along the way.Weaknesses that grow and fester, unchecked.I can see the Faithful now.This is a new thing.An aversion has become an allergy.The Holy and the Sacrosanct have long been anathema to my kind, but the creatures of faith were but a nuisance.As I am given over to the dark, their light cannot help but manifest.They glare with the brilliance of the sun, shining forth with pure intent.I am thankful for their rarity.For every hundred hundred pitiful creatures clutching cross or trinket, perhaps only a single keeps to True Faith.Many claim a connection to the Holy, but so very few conduct themselves in a way to gain the boon of the Faithful.I cannot feed upon them.They are barred to me.A price I have paid for my progress along the Path.But I still mark their presence, burning each into my memory so that I might be aware of their machinations.I am beyond stake and silver, immunized by the blood of a countless mass, but I am not beyond the Faithful.Their very sight unnerves and saps me, draining me of the strength I have so carefully cultivated.My observations have paid dividends.The Faithful follow a pattern.Each bears a connection to the Holy, established deep in their heart and reinforced by the piety of slavish subjugation to the Holy's dictates.They do not venture to the places of questionable reputation.They do not take to the night.They keep to their temples and homes on the High Days, refraining from the lusty spectacle of celebration.I know these patterns, and I adapt.I am aware of their goings on but they are not aware of mine.When a denizen of their hamlet disappears into the night, they cross themselves and whisper a prayer.They do not seek me out.I can grow unchallenged, feasting upon those who have lost the light.This town should have been no different.Nameless and forgotten, it was like the many which had come before it.A few simple streets, a tidy chapel and a bawdy house or three.Small enough that there might not even be a Faithful.But there was.It was an unexpected encounter.Sudden and surprising.Through means and methods unknown, he was within my sight before I was aware of him.Present in a proximity most distressing.The burning aura seared my being, consuming my reservoirs of power and preventing flight to the shadows.I was held, forced to meet the gaze of one of the Faithful."Hullo," he said, nodding in my direction.His clothing was simple but neatly tailored.Small travel stains dappled the soft cloth of his tunic, though it looked little worse for the wear.I could not help but stare, unable to peel my eyes from the burning intensity.He carried no token of faith, no symbol of the faith he carried in his heart.He let the stare linger for a moment before his eyes shifted from mine, offering a shrug."Nice evening, in'it?"He stamped his feet, "A perfect night for a stroll."The aura subsided some once his eyes shifted, unmooring me from its terrible power.I stole the shortest of gasps, letting the cool air fill my lungs.It had been long since I had spoken the low language, and I found my tongue quite unfit to the task.All I could do was force a nod, hoping the creature would be compelled to leave.But no.He turned and looked back at me, "I wondered when you would arrive.I have been expecting it for some time."I could only blink."It has been some time since one has walked as far as you.The Path is quite treacherous."His eyes had a glint to them now, hardening around the edges.My breath came out in a low hiss, whistling around long incisors.The image of the man burned brighter, scalding my soul."Your path has reached its final destination.I give you this one chance to turn back.To return along the way you have come.To undo what you have done."He took a step closer, great swirls of brilliant white flashing about him like a hurricane.He held up a single finger."One chance."I focused my will, trying desperately to deflect the whorls of faith assaulting me, struggling to formulate a response.Finally, I gasped a single word."Faithful."His eyes softened momentarily, a rumbling wave of emotion sweeping over them before the flinty exterior was restored."No.Not anymore."He dropped his voice now, "Many a path has ended with me Blooded, and many more will after yours.Rejoin the light or meet your abyss."He leveled a final stare at me and then turned and ambled away.It was only after he had rounded the bend that my faculties returned to me.My strength slowly rekindled, a small fire drawing from precious little fuel.I had gone too far to turn from the Path.The powers were mine and I would not abandon them.But there could be no doubt: a new obstacle blocked my progress forward.He followed no pattern.He knew the dark even as he walked in the light.Faithless but among the Faithful.Granted the Boon of the Holy, but not walking in the light.Who was this man?

**Got a little carried away when I was writing a prompt response.Ended up over the character count.** 

**Part one found** **.**

At the end of a narrow dark hallway was a room, a pale glow filtering in from below the door.It slowly swung open as the Monsignor approached.This behavior was odd as well.Normally a demon would attempt to ward the door, the boundary between rooms being a particularly strong place to imbue with demonic fortification.Michael crossed himself once more and entered the room, his hand clutching his small silver cross as he whispered a Hail Mary."Hello Monsignor."The girl's voice was light and sweet, though her eyes burned with a terrible wisdom beyond her years."Demon."Michael responded, his mouth still mouthing the words of the Hail Mary."I wondered when you might come," the girl replied, moving her fingers through her long blonde hair, "I certainly made enough noise on my way in."Lawrence glanced at Michael, wondering what the demon's game might be.Even the effort to communicate was odd.A normal demon would simply seek to eliminate the threat rather than engage with one of the attuned."Why have you come?"Michael asked."Because an appropriate vessel was made available."She smiled and then clapped her hands gleefully, a dark shadow seeming to emanate from her."Why?Why her?Why in a way that would draw my attention?"Michael asked, the urge to understand this new entity overwhelming his normal predisposition to dispose of demons immediately."Surely you know it is dangerous to ask," she went back to twirling her fingers in her hair, "my sort is not among the most trustworthy.""You are different," the Monsignor said."I am."Her fingers now worked her hair into a loose plait, braiding as she spoke."And you chose her.Chose this place.Created these ripples.To what end?""It is as I said.An appropriate vessel was made available," she replied with a sigh, appearing to grow bored.She flopped back onto the tattered sheets of her bed and began to stare the ceiling."Surely you knew I would come," Michael replied, "The Venetian Rectory has been my home for some years.It must be known to the demon realm."See moved up to her elbows so she could look Michael into the eyes, the impish gleam returning, "Of course we know you Michael.I knew you would come.Expected it."Michael frowned, the unspoken question was answered a moment later."It's because I do not fear you Michael.You have been quite adept at disrupting my lessers.But I am not lesser.I am greater."She giggled again."Why is she an appropriate vessel?"Lawrence blurted out.The demon glanced at him, her lips drawing into a frown.She regarded him for a moment, as a giant might regard an ant, before turning to look back at Michael."His soul is weak.It would shatter without you."Michael stared.The girl sighed, "Very well, I shall share this tidbit since it will not help you.She is appropriate because she dangles, hanging on the very edge between the abyss and this world."She pulled up the sleeve of her dress, showing a series of scares, some faded with time and some new.Angry bruises dappled the arm, painting it into a kaleidoscope of color."What have you done to her?"Michael asked, his anger rising."Me?Oh, nothing."She giggled again, wiggling her toes in contentment, "I found her this way.""Found her?""Oh yes.She has been subjected to terrible things.Too numerous to count.From here.From there.From him.From them."She waved her hand about dismissively, "She is quite close to the breaking point.Her identity is but a breath from shattering.It is I that hold it together.I that allows her to persist.Her soul was stolen from her," she shrugged, "I have simply become the replacement. "Lawrence looked aghast.Michael seemed oddly calm, "To what end?"The girl rolled over to her stomach and put her chin on her hands, her legs kicking up behind her as she softly kicked the bed, "Because it is time Michael.I have waited, and now I have come."Michael crossed himself again."Lucifer."She giggled.**Continued in** **.**

Always liked guns.Runs in the blood.Goes back to the root of the tree I 'spose.Branch by branch, it's all the same.Didn't matter much who got with the Wesson clan, the apple never fell too far, if'n you take my meaning.Runnin' joke is the Wesson fire out of the womb and then just keep on firin'.Not to get too deep on the background of it all, but it's just worth sayin' that every Wesson worth his salt got a few skulls to his name.I'm proud to say I'm the seventh generation runnin'.Vietnam for me.Second Great for my pappy.First great for his.War of Northern Aggression.Revolution.Right on back to a time when there weren't a gun for a Wesson to raise up.Right proper family tradition.It's a source of pride, but I'd reckoned the bloodshed was behind me.Was lookin' forward to a plot of land and a jug of shine to pass the time.Gave the service my prime and I got a pension to set me up on the slow and easy.Peaceful retirement for a life of war-waging well done.I ain't bitter about being shuffled out.That's what happens when you get over the hill and start tumblin' on down the other side.But that's what I get for countin' my chickens, right?Not sure the up or down of it, but I'm throat deep in shit creek again.Dozed off in my huntin' blind and woke up somewhere that I can't rightly say is a part of the world I'd grown up in.Magic.Swords.Critters of all shapes and sizes.More than one that'd put the rest of my trophy room to shame.I'm not one for stories and yarns, but this place seemed to be made of 'em.Were the situation different, I might even take a shine to the adventure.Truth be told, fartin' around my back porch had gotten to be a bit too much of the same old.This ain't the same old.It's a new old.Princesses.Castles.The Tournament.They don't speak my words, but some things communicate real easy.A sword is a sword regardless of which place you come from.Two swords crossing mean the same here as there.And everyone knows what went down when two people walk through a door and only one bothers to come back.Now I was standing in one of those lines.Paired up.Broad shouldered lad with more swords than I cared to count.Half porcupine.Him and me then.Two in.One out.So be it.No skin off of mine.I've traveled to strange lands and killed people before.If they want me to fight a battle, then I'll give 'em a war.I got the sort of confidence that only a M1911 can instill.Ever hear about the guy who brought a knife to a gun fight?Me neither, 'cause he ain't around no more.But the porcupines aren't much more than half of the problem 'round here.It's the robe and book crowd that set my stomach sideways on the first pass.Hair stood right on end and jumped off my arms when I saw them make their spells in the practice yard.Truth be told, happened the second time too.By the third time I'd come to realize somethin': it takes a lot longer to say a sentence than it takes to fire a bullet.Let 'em spray their gobbledegook all about.I'll be spraying lead.It's as I said, the Wesson clan never stop firin'.Though in this case, I'll need to show a bit of discretion.By the look of things, this'll be a long haul.No one and done Charlie here.Going to have to put down more than a few boys before I get to the other side of this thing.But I got a solution to that problem.A pretty little number that's going to keep me safe and secure so long as I protect it like my life depended on it.Cause it does.Forty-two.It's the difference between life and death.Forty-two bullets to buy my way out of this mess.Every shot gotta be a down payment on freedom or I'm done just as soon as that number reaches zero.But that's okay.I ain't the first Wesson to be hard up with back against the wall.Might be my first battle today, but it ain't my first battle.You can end a war with a bullet, and I got forty-two.

A quiet hush spread through the throne room, interrupted only by the soft chiming of bells in the background.His Highness Vallas Galladria II was dead, leaving the kingdom in mourning.The end had come upon suddenly, it being only a few days since he was stricken with the Ghast.Whispers spread that he had been turned inside out by the wasting sickness, the once hale and nobleman reduced to a husk in mere days.Panic spread, as panic was inclined to do in these uncertain times.If the disease could strike down a king, one who had been appointed with the favor of God, then why not those who were less fortunate?Tale of those who coughed blood in the alleys of Galla already ran rampant, with most keeping to their homes.The matter of ascension had been subject to strenuous debate.A child could sit upon the throne, though even the strongest of men found the perch uncomfortable.The borders were under pressure by the Lancels to the East and the Borgoni to the South.News of Galladia's passing would embolden them.But there could be no respite from the Ghast without a God Chosen in power.A realm's protection resided in the strength of its ruler's connection with the All Mighty, and a mere regent could not hope to hold the pestilence at bay.A True King must be named.Thus this moment came to be.Restive nobles looked long-eyed at their counterparts, each cough was greeted with a startled response from those around.Gatherings such as these did not take place while the Ghast remained unchecked.Even the market square stood empty, the wooden stalls barred and quiet.But one could not avoid the Requirement of Fealty.The ascension of a new king must be accompanied by the renewal of oaths, Ghast or not.The Chamberlain cleared his throat, his broad shoulders pulled back with his chest puffed out."Here ye, here ye, come now Her Holiness the Arch Bishop of Galla, Hand of the All Mighty."Great doors in the back of the chamber creaked open, admitting a slender woman of progressed age.Her silver hair was drawn back into a long braid, woven with the crimson and pristine white of the Holy Order of Galla.Her hands, outstretched before her, had a purple pillow with a small crown perched atop it.It had been hastily fashioned in response to the king's death.Her head was bowed and she took the long walk down the central aisle of the throne room in short but purposeful steps.As she approached the Chamberlain, she came to a stop.He gave her a small bow."Do you come to do the will of God?""I do."The Chamberlain bowed and took a step to the side, clearing her path to the throne.She ascended the steps, taking them one at a time until she came to stand beside the ornate wooden throne.She looked out over the gathered nobles."I have spent the night in commune with the All Mighty."Whispers followed with more than one noble clutching a holy trinket."A king has been chosen."The whispers elevated to applause and cheers.While the matter not been in much doubt, there was precedent for a prolonged search when there were multiple claimants.Thankfully, the King had passed with only a single eligible heir.Archbishop Galla waited for the room to fall back into silence."The All Mighty has named Prince Casdri as the God Chosen."The bells from the Holy Seat, chiming since the demise of King Galladria fell silent, replaced by a pealing trumpet.A moment later, a small child entered from the doors the Archbishop had come through.Prince Casdri was dressed plainly, absent the finery typical to such an occasion.There was some consternation at this, but the prince seemed unaware or indifferent to the fact.He carefully made his way down the center aisle as well, coming to stand at the foot of the steps leading up to the throne."I have been called," he said, his fragile voice barely extending to the nobles behind him."You have been named.""What have I been named?"He asked."King," she said.""I do not wish it," he said, evoking a tittering from the nobles.This was not a common answer.Most Named accepted the Holy Charge immediately."Your wishes are second to the Will of God," Archbishop Galla replied."I am young.I am not strong, like my father."The prince's voice hitched at the mention of his father.They had shared a strong bond, and the loss was said to weigh heavily on the small child."The kingdom does not need a fist, it needs a heart," the Archbishop said.The boy was quiet, his eyes locked on the throne towering above him."Will you help me?"He asked, glancing to the Archbishop.Her eyes widened slightly, and then she nodded briefly.Prince Casdri turned to look at the Chamberlain, the stern taskmaster that had run the Royal Household since King Galladria had been a child."Will you help me?"The Chamberlain clapped a fist over his heart, "Aye, I'll help."Prince Casdri seemed heartened at that.Finally, he turned to look at the assembled nobles.They were a fractious lot, causing as many problems as they solved, but they were the blood coursing through the kingdom.There could be no Galla without them."Will you help me?"The nobles were required to swear, their help was not conditioned on their agreement.It constituted a radical reshaping of the relationship between throne and crest.There was a long silence before a man in the front row took a small step forward and ducked his head.Lord Fastrus of the Easterlund, a border noble who had suffered much during the tension."Prince, we are here to swear to you."Prince Casdri looked at him, a confused look on his face, "I do not want you to swear.I want you to help."The Chamberlain walked toward the Prince and knelt beside him, whispering in his ear.Prince Casdri frowned and shook his head once, "No.That's not what I want."He turned and looked out at the nobles, "My father said I should do the right thing because I want to, not because I have to."He looked at Lord Fastrus, "Will you help me?"Lord Fastrus stared back, his eyes watering, "I knew your father.Fought alongside him.He was a noble king, and I followed him willingly."He bowed, "I will help you."A chorus rose behind him, as the nobles repeated the words, each offering a bow.It was impossible to discern whether each offered their pledge, but the prince seemed unconcerned.Instead, he offered a small bow of his own, "Thank you."He turned back to the Archbishop, giving her a small nod."Prince Casdri Galladria, you have been named King.""I am not ready, but I will learn," he replied."You will have help."He smiled."I will."

Zyy jetted forward, its cilia splayed outward in a broad net.Xy sensed the surging in currents and squirted backward, narrowly dodging the Right.Back and forth they darted, Zyy the hunter, Xy the hunted.Their movements were choreographed by instinct, handed down to them by ancestors long since deceased from a planet long since destroyed.Zyy would expand, hungrily gulping in tank fluid to fling itself at Xy.Xy would shrink as it darted away, left with only a few panicked moments to swallow fluid of its own in preparation for the next onslaught.The effort tired Xy, its body not used to the exertions.It had come into this world as an observation-specialization, one of the more sedentary specializations.Until this moment, its life had largely consisted of peaceful floating in a fringe tank.It was unprepared, and each evasion cost it precious energy, slowly wearing it down.But Zyy, also observation-specialized, would be similarly limited.The question would be who would last longest.Xy understood the stakes, understood the cost of failure.All Zix knew of the scourge of the singleton.Of the havoc they had caused to the Collective.Zix history was replete with examples of a single tank putting itself before the colony to the ruin of all.Whole tank pods had been lost, never to be replaced.Specialization lines irreparably harmed as critical members were removed from the division plan.The singleton loomed large among the dangers that threatened the very existence of the Zix.Only Xy stood between the Zix and calamity.A tank could not operate without consensus, and Xy could stop Zyy.So long as Xy remained free, the possibility of warning the Zix of the danger remained.Perhaps they could never rejoin the Collective again, but at least they would do no harm.Zyy swooped in again, trying to corner Xy against the side of the tank.Xy again evaded, propelling itself to the far side as Zyy recovered its fluid.Xy knew it could not continue much longer.The tank was finite and the currents swirled against it.It must get the message out to the Zix.It must take the risk.The very notion for Right-minded, but there were no other options.The currents told Xy that Zyy remained some distance away.There may be no more opportunities to act.Resolve firming, Xy did not recover its fluid, losing the maneuverability it needed to continue the effort to escape.Instead, Xy flicked out its cilia, pushing against the flows of the tank and orienting them toward the communication array.Faster and faster its cilia moved, fighting down terror as it assembled message.Zyy stirred.Xy could feel the disruption of the currents behind, feel Zyy closing the distance.The desire to flee was overwhelming, but Xy summoned the resilience of a Left charged with a duty.A warning.A single word.*Singleton*.The message slipped out just as Zyy's cilia closed in around Xy, intertwining and establishing dozens of thought and emotion threads.Xy could not resist, its energy and fluid expended.Zyy's mind flooded into Xy's consciousness.A swirling eddy of raw being.Betrayal.Anger.Frustration.Sadness.And, above it all, a certainty.The Collective was wrong.Zyy was right.Their mission was more important than the Collective's desires.The Collective's wishes and will were immaterial.They must proceed or it would all be forfeit.Xy tried to push back the onslaught.To retain its sense of self and reason, but Zyy was too strong.More and more cilia shot out, pulling Xy closer to Zyy.Xy felt its thoughts blur and run together with Zyy's.The distance between them grew smaller still.There was no Left to balance the Right.There was no consensus.Only Zyy and its hunger.They touched.Membrane to membrane.The Zix responded, demanding to know the meaning of the message.Desperate to understand what was going on within the tank.The float colony spoke with a unified voice, expressing its concern.But they did not receive a response.ZyyXy was not interested in anything the Collective desired.It only cared for one thing: the completion of its mission.It would save the Zix since they were clearly unable to save themselves.Alone in the tank, ZyyXy spread its cilia out, and pulled the wormkey online.The Zix's calls redoubled, but went unanswered.The singleton was gone.**Part Fifteen may be found** **.**

"What about humans?"Galatra asked, her soft voice carrying across the lecture hall."Does it work on them?"An awkward silence ensued as the Master took a few steps toward Galatra, his piercing blue eyes focused on her beneath white eyebrows."Why do you ask?"She shrugged, "If you can summon a creature, why not a person?"Master Lumina leaned inward, "You did not answer my question, Galatra.I asked you why you would ask."Her face paled and she glanced about, her pink tongue flicking out to wet her lips."I was just curious."Lumina gave her an appraising look, letting another silence fill the room.Finally, he spoke, "It is best to not be curious about some things.""What would happen?"The question squeaked out.Galatra flushed, but the desire to know still showed plainly on her face.The Master paused and, after a moment sighed, relenting."It is cost enough to bring a beast into your head.It has simple thoughts.Simple desires.A competent summoner can retain a measure of themselves while carrying a beast.Particularly strong summoners may carry more, though any person will eventually meet their limits."His voice dropped now, "The strongest summoner cannot hold another person in their head.It tears them apart, they lose themselves."He strode away from her now, his back turned as he made his way toward the lectern at the front of the hall."And, should they manage the feat, any attempt to summon the pact-bound will result in an abomination.""How do you know?""It is known," Lumina replied, his hands settling on either side of the lectern as he fixed Galatra with a baleful look.She was among the best of the students, but her mind often wandered into places it should not.The boundaries of magic were fixed and immutable.Pushing against them was costly.Crossing them risked ruin for far more than the hapless mage involved."What do they become?""Heartless," he whispered."They enter the world as a fragment of themselves.Their soul bound by pact, their mind washed clean of all but the most basic of thoughts.They walk but they do not live.They hunger but they are never sated.They become a pestilence, a spreading wave that turn the living into creatures such as themselves."Galatra tilted her head to the side, considering the information.There was not shock, no fear, in her eyes, only the same burning curiosity there always was.She hungered as the heartless did, voraciously consuming all knowledge that came before her.The Master fed and fed, but her mind always demanded more.Lumina was intensely proud of her.A student such as her came along once in a generation.Proper training and focus, she would accomplish things beyond either of their imagining.He slapped the book on his lectern shut, "I think, perhaps, that is an appropriately grim place to stop for the day.You are dismissed."The students began to pack their items into their satchels and file out.All except one.Galatra always remained after the others had left.She had long ago that the quiet time between classes was an opportunity to pilfer additional tidbits of knowledge.But today it was Master Lumina that wanted to know more.There had been something to Galatra's interest.A new layer of intensity and persistence that had not been there before."What has your mind in tangles Galatra?"Lumina asked after the last of the students filed out.Galatra fidgeted with the buckle on her satchel, not meeting his eyes."Galatra?"She mumbled a response."Speak, I am old and hard of hearing."Her eyes rose to meet his."I said, you're wrong."Master Lumina smiled and folded his arms.This was a game they played with some regularity.Galatra always searched for the cracks in his knowledge, always delighting in the prospect of discovering something he did not know.Her efforts rarely came to fruition."Oh, and what am I wrong about?"The intensity returned to her eyes, "About human summoning."A cloud crossed over Lumina's face, "There is more than enough--"

"You can share a mind," she cut in."What?"She stared at him, "You can share."Sweat popped out on his brow, "Galatra, what have you done?""Does it matter?"She looked away now, "It's done."

"But...why is he..." Lucy let the sentence fall off, unsure of whether she could say H-E double hockey sticks in front of the Priest."Well, he disobeyed God, so he was cast out from Heaven and renamed from Lucifer to Satan," Father O'Reilly replied."So he is just...down there?All alone?"Lucy asked."Yes.That is his punishment.He is God's adversary.That is what his name means."Lucy sat silently, absorbing the information.Sunday school was always her favorite time of the week.The stories about God and the Angels and all the rest always pulled her in, transporting her to a mystical world that seemed so far removed from what her life was like in elementary school.The story of Satan traveled with her throughout the day.She could not help but feel sorry for the fallen angel, all alone from his angel friends in a fiery place.Disobeying God was bad, but it seemed like the punishment was very harsh.She had once been grounded for a weekend and that had felt terrible.She could only imagine what it would be like to be forced to spend the rest of all time locked away.Before bed, she knelt down for her prayers.Mom was very strict about that, saying that if she could not find it in her heart to pray for someone each night then she had no heart.Mostly she prayed for her family.Sometimes she prayed for a little brother or sister so she could have a friend.It was lonely on their farm sometimes.Tonight, she prayed for someone new.Bowing her head, she began to whisper, "Satan, I hope you find a happy place to live and don't need to stay in H E double hockey sticks.I think it is very sad that you lost your wings and your home.I would be very sad if I lost my home.Amen."She crawled into bed, hoping that her prayer would make a difference.God said everyone could be forgiven, maybe that meant Satan could be too.She drifted off, with strange red vision filling her head.The next morning, she awoke to the feeling of something scrabbling across her chest.She let out a high pitched squeak and then jolted up, sending the intrude careening across the room.Her breathing came in great panicked puffs as she stared across the room.The anxiety subsided as a small red squirrel appeared from the garbage bin it had landed in.It's bright bushy tail twitched excitedly as its odd red eyes darted about.It took a moment to brush its claws through its whiskers, setting them back into order before it climbed back up in the bed."I'm so sorry Mr. Squirrel, I didn't know it was you.I was scared."The squirrel tilted it's head to the side and then took a few hops forward and sat back on its haunches by Lucy's feet."I'm Beezle."Lucy gawked."Normally people are supposed to say somethin' back.Make conversation," Beezle said, filling the awkward silence."I...I didn't know squirrels could talk."Suddenly Beezle's tail shimmered and shifted from a red poof to a searing flame."I'm not really a squirrel."Lucy stared at the tail, "Um...Mr. Beezle...your tail is on fire."Lucy felt it was important to inform the squirrel of this fact as it seemed to be unaware."No, it's more like my fire is on squirrel."The flame blinked out, replaced by the red tail again."I've been sent to watch over you by the Big Guy.He took a shine to you.""Big Guy?"Lucy asked, still confused on how a fire could be squirreled."Satan to you probably.He has a lot of names: The Great Betrayer, The Morning Star, Snake Eyes, Sauron, etc."Beezle waved a paw about conversationally as he listed the names."Sauron?""Not much of a reader, are you?"Beezle asked, inspecting his nails one by one."Um...I read.""That's good kid.They used to burn girls alive that could read, so it looks like we're making some progress topside.""What?Who would burn girls?"Lucy asked, alarmed."Listen, we're getting off track, a few burnings here and there are pretty much par for the course with humanity so we might as well not get too worked up about it.The important part is that I've been tasked with being your familiar.Here to protect and help you as you see fit.""For how long?""Seventy nine years, seventy nine days, fourteen hours and fifty four minutes give or take," Beezle said."That is very...um...specific?""It is.I normally do short stints, but, like I said, Satan took a shine to you so I'm on a life contract this go around."Lucy blinked."Life contract?""Yeah, stuck topside until you're about six feet closer to us."He drew a claw across his throat and shut his eyes and keeled over."I'm going to die?"Lucy asked, finding everything increasingly difficult to process.Talking squirrels were something she was prepared to deal with.Talking flames wearing squirrel suits provoking existential crises was something else entirely."Sure kid, all humans die sooner or later.You'll be on the right side of the distribution curve though.Invest in a 401k early."Beezle bounced around in a small circle, apparently working off some nervous energy."But...I don't want to die."Lucy's lip began to quiver."I'll make sure you get to the full seventy nine.By that time you'll be ready to kick off the coil anyways."Lucy felt her eyes water, but managed to keep it together."So...are you going to be my, um, squirrel friend?"She'd always wanted a pet of her own.All of their animals were for the farm and though she was friendly with them it never felt like they were really pets."More like your enforcer.Anyone give you any problems, I'm here to take care of them."Beezle said, his eyes burning brightly."But I don't have any problems with anyone..." Lucy replied.Beezle's whiskers quivered, and he was silent for a moment, as if considering his next words."I'm not supposed to talk about it much, the future is sort of something topsiders are meant to find out about as it comes to pass.""Talk about what?"Lucy asked."About why you need an enforcer."&#x200B;

"Red alert!"Kai called out.The lighting on the *Alcubierre* shifted to have a pale red hue shortly after the command.Smalls clicks and pops emitted as each crew member strapped themselves into their constraints and secured their space helmet into place.They had drilled on this time and again over the last few days, until they moved about their impact checklists with practiced ease.The viewscreen on the bridge lit up with a chorus of green as station after station indicated ready status.Engine.Telemetry.Navigation.Security.Medical.Kai felt the weight of command settle in on him.The tension that had slowly been building in the background now bubbled up to the surface, pulling at the last vestiges of his frayed nerves.When he had taken to space, he'd known there would be consequences.If he was being honest with himself, the stakes were part of the appeal.Everything felt more important when lives hung in the balance, and he'd lived for the thrill.He was older now, but it was still there, the romance with the brink of death.Or had been.Staring down the destruction of the galaxy was having a profound effect on him.The stakes had gotten to high.Life and limb were fair game, but the death of everything and everyone he knew wasn't he'd signed up for.Not what any of the people on this ship had signed up for.Everyone knew it might have been a one way trip to the black, but that was the worst they'd feared.He watched as the distance meter steadily decreased, the visualization of the Proxima Barrier bearing down on the blinking dot of the *Alcubierre.* Kai's couldn't help but wonder who or what has been the cause of it all.Something was out there.Something that was capable of changing the rules.But to what end?Why go to all of the trouble?How did this make any sense?He supposed it didn't matter.It was too late to do anything about it."Brace for impact!"Kai bellowed, his knuckles white as he clenched the armrests of his command chair.\---

ZyyXy felt liberated.For the first time in its existence, action followed immediately from thought.It alone determined the correct choice, the flows were at its command.The possibilities seemed endless, and it wondered why it had not ventured down this path before.It was increasingly difficult to reconcile the being that had been content to spend its floating peaceably in the tank, monitoring the galaxy, with what it had become.ZyyXy was different.It understood that it stood apart from the Collective, that the path it followed would never be accepted, regardless of the good it did.A part of it shriveled at the thought of being isolated, of leaving the stagnancy of the Collective behind.ZyyXy spared the briefest of moments to console that small part of it.It wished that there had been another way.Xy had been a satisfactory tank companion, perhaps even an ideal one as far as Lefts went, but it had proven inadequate to the task.Xy had been unable to feel the current pushing them forward.There was no solace in the false tranquility of consensus.It was an eddy, swirling back in on itself, funneling into a whirlpool that would drain the Zix of what little remained of their species.Xy did not understand this.It never would.It could not accept the necessity of this change.Singleton.Rogue tank.Apart from the Collective.Free.ZyyXy skipped and jumped through Zix space, each passage through the wormhole bringing it closer to the projected path of the Sol Anomaly.Even the headiness of freedom could not diminish the sense of urgency it felt as its cilia frantically adjusted the flows between each jump, desperate to regain the time it had lost in its battle with Xy.There could be no certainty in the matter, and time must be maximized to cover the greatest number of possibilities.Did the object retain its speed?Did it alter course?Were there unknown objects in its path?What was the intent of the object?Were there others?ZyyXy could not answer these questions without more information.It must do as it was meant to do.Observe.Gather.Learn.So little time.Faster.It must go faster.\---

"A point of light."Lumini Searas hissed, the sound echoing off the dark confines of the command chamber."In the sea?"Sublumini Vessra replied."Yes...a great ripple..." Silence followed, the quiet drip of water the only marker of the passage of time.Finally, the Lumini spoke again."Harbinger waves.""Whence?""The Away, across the Boundary.The place of naught save the Banished."Lumini Searas whispered, a keening wail rising up afterward."Banished!"Vessra called out before joining the wail.Great pulses of light emanated from the Luminox ship, sending the warning to all who would heed it.A sailor in the sea betwixt here and there.The Boundary between breached with only one explanation: The Banished made their return, sailing a tide of vengeance.\---

"Captain, we're into the deep.It'll be a long haul, but we're ready for it."Lieutenant Populus said.The Captain propped her chin up her elbow, frowning out into the inky blackness."It certainly makes a statement, doesn't it?""Ma'am?"Vera waved her other hand at the viewing screen, "We aren't in Kansas anymore.""Kansas, Ma'am?"Vera sighed, "A long time ago, there was a place called Kansas and there was a story about a woman with a dog--" she cut off, gave another sigh, "What I meant to say, Lieutenant, is that we're a long way from home.""Yes Ma'am.""How long before we're across the span?""At current velocity accretion rate, we should reach Andromeda within three months," Lieutenant Populus replied, his eyes darting back and forth as his brain accessed the ship's uplink."We'll only slow for a proximity alert.""Not much chance of that out here.""No Ma'am.""Very well, maintain course.I'll be in quarters.""Yes Ma'am."\---

"And the Luminox are certain?"Councillor Mazer asked, his eyes boring into the Admiral standing at attention before him."We have no way of second-guessing them Councillor, they are the only ones who can perceive disturbances exceeding the speed of light."The Admiral pulled up a visualization and cast it as a projection in the space between him and the assembled Councillors."The Boundary has stood for time immemorial.We are unable to discern how it has been breached, but the Luminox are quite insistent...in their way.""How can we know it is the Banished?Time has come and gone.Even the Legend fades," Councillor Klly intoned.Her skepticism on all matters was something of a Legend in its own right."The galaxy was scoured and scourged before the Boundary.There were none but the Banished and it has not been enough time for another to emerge."The Admiral was simply repeating the words of the Legend now, but he knew not what else to do."Perhaps a passer-by, a skipper through the ponds," Councillor Klly replied, continuing her questioning."The Luminox would have sensed another FTL disturbance.They see all in the black between.It is only the light of the galaxy that blinds them," the Admiral replied.There was a murmur as the Councillors conferred at some length.The Admiral stood straight as he awaited their verdict, thankful to hold no responsibility in the matter beyond the execution of their eventual decision.Finally, the mumbled voices died down and the Councillors turned their gaze upon the Admiral once more.Councillor Mazer spoke, his voice clear and authoritative, "We cannot allow the Banished to bring their pestilence to our shores.You are to wade into the black and do as you must.We will command a Luminox attachment to accompany you for the purpose of setting a capture net."The Admiral bowed, "Yes Councillors.It shall be done."\---

Red alerts blared in the background as the ship jostled violently.Captain Vera Yakimoa's eyes shot open and instantly began to dart back and forth, pulling in the ships feed.Proximity alert triggered.Collision object unnatural.Arrayed in a manner desired to force interception.Vera swore and rolled out of bed, yanking a command jacket on as she hopped out the door and rushed down the hallway to the bridge.She burst through the door to find the view screen awash in flashing colors."What am I looking at Lieutenant?""I'm not sure Captain, it's the source of the proximity alert.A number of objects, spaced equidistant from each other.Each projecting light on a series of repeating patterns."She stared for a moment, her heart thudding in her chest, "We're not alone."For millennia humanity had searched the stars as it gradually spread from its stellar cradle.Always silence had greeted them.The galaxy was empty, not even the smallest whisper of life to be found.They were alone.Always alone.And now they were not."The patterns?What do they say?""The AI is consuming them as they arrive.It began as a basic math primer and is now expanding into logical constructs.We are building a basis for communication, but I do not know what they intend.""We are not alone."Captain Vera repeated, tears forming in her eyes.\---

"The Banished have stopped.They have not responded to Andromedean hails," Communicator Z'Chrix said."We have initiated a communication bridge."Admiral Z'Vallus considered this."It is perhaps no surprise they have lost Andromeda in their long isolation."He remained amazed by the course of events that had brought them to this point.To the incredible precision of the Luminox and their ability to discern the trajectory and speed of the Banished.To the even more incredible ability of the Banished to sense the obstacles placed in their way at faster than light speeds and to stop in time to avoid them.Their technology seemed considerably advanced over Andromeda's.But was it a trap?If so, to what end?\---

"Captain, we have established enough of a logic framework to translate the communication.It reads, 'Banished.Why have you come?"Lieutenant Populus read out, his voice quavering."Is that all?Banished?What's banished?"Vera replied."Ma'am, the framework is growing exponentially now.There is considerably more, including what appears to be a visual communication methodology.""Can we implement it?""Already in progress Ma'am," the Lieutenant replied.The view screen fuzzed and then shifted from the flashing lights.A moment later it resolved into a picture of a man.A human man...or what appeared to be a human man.His grim stare turned into one of shock as the communication channel fully resolved, completing the two-way bridge.I did not believe it.The legends were true...The Banished  have returned!

There is no end, the story just continues.A snake biting its own tail, coiled around and swirling into infinity.Where does it stop?It does not.Where did it begin?Long ago.Do you have the time?I feel the need to unburden myself.To explain why I am what I am.Why I do the things I do.Indulge me, the journey has been long, but it may be recounted briefly enough.This is a fairytale of sorts.It begins, like many do, a long time ago in a land far away and forgotten.Thousands upon thousands of years separate now and then.An unfathomably long time.A time well beyond what any man should be made to endure.I was there.In this kingdom far away and forgotten.It was my home.The land was green and lush.The king just and fair.Just as a good fairytale land should be.And there was magic.Real magic.Not the manmade magic of gun and bomb.Not the cheap chicanery of the sidewalk huckster.Wizardry.Magery.Witchcraft.A thousand disciplines Mastered by thousands more.I did not have the spark.None of the force flowed through me.It was absent.Notably so.Most have at least a glimmer, a whisper that, while not enough to bloom into practice, was enough to nurture life.I was dark.A hole in the flow of magic through man.A weak link in a chain that bound the rest of humanity.Weak link.No.That's incorrect.Better to say I was simply not a part of the chain.Not a link at all.I stood apart.Impervious and powerful in my own right.Magic could not touch me.Whenever I approached, the tendrils of the flow would wither and melt away, driven back by my very presence.I was a threat to the Masters, and so I was hunted.I killed my first wizard shortly after I turned sixteen.Even now, all of these years later, I can remember the purple of his face as my hands choked the life out of him.How he gasped and struggled.But without his magic, he was but a man.Weak and frail.As he passed from this life to the next, I felt a wave of nausea.An intense bang in my gut that throbbed and pulsed alongside my heartbeat.I could not say the source, nor could I explain its meaning.I discovered the source when I killed again.Two came, trying to blot out the man who carried no spark.I was older.Better prepared.More knowledgeable.Lethal.After their deaths, the nausea returned, tearing at me with twice the strength.Still, I did not know the meaning, but I could no longer pretend that I would not be a target for being what I was.I would be hunted for the rest of my days, always watching the corners and hoping the next bend did not hold any others of ill intent.I could hunt or be hunted.I chose to hunt.I only discovered the meaning at the end, when the masters had been brought low, destroyed as much by my hand as their greed and arrogance.The nausea stalked me throughout, a deep well of pain constantly churning in my gut as I put them all to the sword.As I loomed over the last, my blade dripping with the ichor of the High Council, I finally received my explanation.A punishment.A curse.The death of each fed the cancer within.The cost of snuffing the spark from the world was laid upon me in full.A life unending, a continuous hell stretching until no man walked the Earth.Torment and pain.For thousands of years, only these were my companions.But a solution presents itself.A dark soul emerges, offering a solution.I am repulsed by what he represents, but he may serve as a means to an end.Man has discovered the tools to architect their own demise, and this man...this...Fhrer may further that.Were the torment less, I might bear it longer, but my guilt can no longer hold the agony back.I must be rid of it.I must be rid of all of them.All who walk and reside must be put to bed so that I may finally rest.I salute the man.He sits beside a large, finely polished wooden desk.Behind him, a large flag is unfurled over the mantle.The stark colors of red, black and white impose an air of quiet menace to the otherwise ordinary-looking man.He cannot fool me.He is a killer.His heart is black and the abyss resides within.Yes.An architect of doom.A man who cannot be sated with anything less than it all.A solution to my problem.The man nods, "Herr Malovin, there are many stories of you."I cannot deny it, though I expect the man does not know them all.Only those within the realm of what he perceives as possible have been accepted.The truth is not understood.I am a man of talents, but he does not know how far they extend.He will use me for his ends, just as I will use him for mine.I nod my head, "Yes, Fhrer."He seems pleased by the acknowledgment, the sound of his leather souls clacking against the marble floor rises up in response."Very good."He nods to himself."You are a man of war?"I have never known peace.I nod.He laces his fingers together, the knuckles going white, "Are you prepared to serve?To unleash these talents?"I have no choice.The pain must end.I nod."You will swear an oath to the Fatherland?To the Nazi party?To me?"He leans forward.What is an oath?A small price to pay to buy my peace.I nod.He smiles, his brown eyes gleefully squinting behind his glasses."Then serve."I snap my feet together and raise my arm, saluting him."Heil Hitler."It must end.I cannot bear more.What have I become?

"Which track are you on?"Zeus asked as he flipped through the program."Eh, I'm going heavy on rebranding and self-discovery," Ra replied, his hawk eyes darting back and forth across the convention hall."I had a good thing going back in Egypt, but then the Christians really screwed it all up."His eyes squinted at a large inflatable cross floating above an exhibition booth for the Catholics."Was thinking maybe I look into an apparel deal.Nike said it's done wonders for her."Zeus shrugged, "I mean, if you're going to sell out..."

"What else am I going to do at this point?At least you've got Olympus.That's prime real estate.They turned my place into a tourist attraction."Ra slumped down into a chair beside Zeus, glumly picking at a loose thread on the chair."You know, I've been coming to DietyCon for a few thousand years.Every time I say I'm going to figure out a way to get back into the game, and every time I'm back here a few years later saying the same thing.""Whaddya gonna do?The big three got a lock on it right now.Don't see that changing much."Ra snorted, "They're not even Gods.Jesus.What did he do?Turn a bunch of water into wine?"Ra waved his hands about, "OoooOoOoo, sooooooo impressive.Maybe he can get a gig as a bartender."Zeus coughed and nodded.Ra's eyes followed Zeus' nod and saw Jesus standing amidst a crowd.He was hawking his Ten Steps to Godliness self-help seminar again.Poor fools were all just lapping it up.Ra sighed, "You ever think we're just fooling ourselves?I mean, I had my time in the sun, hell, I WAS the sun.Maybe I just book the W and call it a day."A little thundercloud appeared over Zeus' head as he frowned."You can't give up Ra.Eternity is a long time, anything can happen.I mean, take Thor for example.Guy was totally on the outs until he got that Marvel gig.Now look at him, guy is a rockstar.Maybe he isn't pulling down faith points, but he's got a solid base to work with and he was way lower on the all-time leaderboard than you are."A beautiful woman came up to the two of them, a circlet made of herbs and twigs resting atop her head, "Is this seat taken?"Ra brushed off the cushion, "All yours."She flopped down into the chair, letting out a long breath, "This place is chaos."Zeus leaned over, reaching across Ra with an outstretched hand, "Zeus.King of Olympus.Slayer of the Titans.Master of--"

"We've all got titles big man.You aren't impressing anyone."Zeus replied.The woman giggled, shaking her head in amusement.She accepted Zeus hand, "I'm Aja.An Orisha.Based out of Africa.Mostly focus on P & P."

"P & P?"Ra asked."Plants and potions," Aja replied."You active or lapsed?"Zeus said."Active.Small base of worshippers but they're devout and it's a pretty good setup," Aja said.Ra sighed, "Must be nice.""It *is* nice," Aja said."At the end of the day, we're all gods in some capacity.Seems like we have a lot to be thankful for.""That what I've been trying to tell birdhead over here, but he's just been down in the dumps for the last century.Been a real drag at the afterparty too."Zeus gave Ra a small punch on the shoulder.Ra glared at Zeus and then turned back to Aja, "I've just been getting a bit bored.I spent some time dabbling in a few side projects, but there's just really nothing like tending a flock."Aja nodded, "What did you do?""I was in the sun biz.Was front and center back in Ancient Egypt," Ra said."Oh!That's interesting.Mawu has a dual specialty of sun and moon for us, but she said she was looking for some extra help."Aja leaned closer, "Turns out it's a night and day job."Aja giggled again."You think maybe she'd be willing to take someone on part-time?I could cover the day shift for her."Ra rocked back and forth in his chair, trying, unsuccessfully, to conceal his eagerness."Why not?She'll be at the party tonight.I can introduce her."Aja smiled."That'd be great!"A small little ray of sunlight shined down on Ra, which was odd since it was indoors.Aja patted Ra's hand, "See there's a lot to look forward to."A little seedling sprouted up from a little pile of dirt Aja left on the top of Ra's hand."See you tonight!"Ra nodded numbly, his eyes fixed on the little seedling in wonder."He'll see you tonight.He's very excited."Zeus said as Aja stood up and departed.Once she was gone he put an arm around Ra, "See?You're back in the game."Ra carefully moved the seedling over to the cushion beside him.A nodded again, "I'd still like a sneaker deal."Zeus laughed, "Who doesn't?"**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

Planning for the end of days required time, but time was something I had in abundance.The careful crafting of the ultimate goat weapon was not something to be rushed.I tended the goats, raising generation upon generation, selecting only the finest warriors of each.The rest I used for my Ye Olde Goat Byproducts business -- milk, cheese, meat, the works.Even though NutraMins were the dominant food group, some folks still liked to rock it old school.It was actually quite a fantastic business.Anyways, goat warriors.With each passing decade, their horns became sharper, their bleats louder and more distracting, their beards more ferocious.Their temper?Well, let me tell you that goats already got a bit of rage to them, but selective breeding for aggression over four hundred and sixty years can really up things a notch.It took me another millennium just to get Goat Force Alpha to basic combat readiness.Unfortunately, in that time humanity had embraced the singularity and was now traveling at faster than light speeds.This compounded my problem significantly since I would now need to find a way to launch my goat army directly into space.This was logistically complicated as I did not have even a basic knowledge of spacefaring and all of my excess resources from the Byproducts business had been reinvested into the goat genetic supersoldiers effort, leaving me sorely strapped for cash.In retrospect, I realized now that not establishing a diverse portfolio of interests was a mistake.It wasn't that I needed to expand beyond goats per se, I just needed to not go entirely all in on the goat army.My poor grounding in mathematics was coming back to bite me in the ass.I should have realized that humanity was likely to outpace any advancements I made in goat-tech, but there wasn't a lot I could do about that now.It was a bitter lesson, but I wasn't the sort to just give up at the first obstacle.It wasn't like I was without resources.I could simply leverage the goat army here on earth and then focus on the interstellar humans once I had secured adequate resources locally.I somehow needed to get the goats incorporated into the singularity and then they could space hunt at my behest.I pulled out a neural-link.I didn't have integrated circuitry since my brain wasn't tech compatible.I had to settle for a basic headset.I pulled it on and began to pull up information on singularity hubs.They were spread throughout the country, offering people quick and immediate transportation from any critical point in the broader human sphere of influence.If I could just somehow gain access to one, singularize Goat Force Alpha, and then beam them off, I might still have a chance.I walked out into the yard.The goats snapped to attention as I appeared.They had been bred for intense loyalty to the Goatlord (that's what I called myself.I'd always wanted to be a lord).I knelt down, staring into Julius Goatsar's face.He was my pride and joy.The strongest.The best.Every inch the master goat."Commander Goatsar," I intoned, looking down at him with a mix of pride and trepidation."M-A-A-A-A-A-E-E-E-E-H-H-H," he replied, peering intently at me, poised for any command I might issue."We are fast arriving at the time when you will lead the Goat Force into battle," he stood a little taller at this, stretching to his full height of six feet, his TERROR BEARD bristling with vibrancy, "in order for you to fulfill your mission, you must secure this location," I pulled up a holoview and pointed out the nearest singularity point."Within that singularity juncture there is a small room shaped like a hexagon," I pulled up a schematic that was readily available online, "you are to enter that room, disable the defensive turrets and await my orders.Do you understand?"He blinked at me once and then unleashed a tremendous WAR BLEAT.I nodded, awed by the creature that I had raised.My pride and joy.My champion.[Continued in PART 3.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerilousPlatypus/comments/9c6bfm/story_continuation_the_goatcalypse_goatageddon_a/)

Category four hoard.Only my third, and I'd seen more than my fair share of treasure piles in my day.Just at a casual glance I picked up two crowns, the soft glow of numerous magical objects and a gemstone the size of a fist.The client had been at it for some time, and there were signs the underlying cause was severe.Muttering to myself, I carefully picked my way toward the snoring behemoth curled up atop the mound.I had a number of magical items of my own on to mask my entrance, something of a requirement in my line of work.Death by dragon was a bit of a occupational hazard.But it's as they say, sometimes the word is mightier than the sword.Which is odd since sword has an extra letter in it.A few feet away from the dragon's snout I reached into my bag of holding and pulled out a little stool.I jammed it down into the coins so it could hold my weight, causing a harrumph from the dragon.I plopped down on the stool and pulled out a notepad and pen.It always paid to be prepared before revealing oneself on the initial consultation.I set a small egg timer beside me as well, turning it over so that the sands began to trickle down.The townsfolk had only paid for an hour.I removed my quiet cloak, and cleared my throat."Good afternoon Bezzlebeetrix, I am Doctor Wordsman, under the employ of the Cassock Township.Would this be a good time to--"

A great roar sounded out in the cavern as the dragon reared up.Its massive head swiveled back and forth over me, entirely missing my presence.Folks said to let sleeping dragons lie, but it was so very hard to approach them when they were awake."Who disturbs my--"

I coughed loudly into my hand, "Bezzlebeetrix, I assume your time is very valuable, as is mine."The dragon stopped and then tilted its head to the side, fixing me with a large green eye.It squinted."Thank you, now that I have your attention, I would like to explain my presence and conduct my business.Would that be acceptable?"The dragon blinked, clearly considering the situation.Relations between dragon and human were somewhat fraught with difficulties and misunderstandings, and my approach often elicited confusion among my prospective patients.I tended to use that confusion to my advantage.Seeing no immediate threat in my pen and notepad, the dragon relaxed and settled down."Speak, human.""Doctor Wordsman," I replied.It snorted in response.I flipped open my notepad."As I was saying, I am here to provide therapeutic services to one Bezzlebeetrix, Scourge of Ravenka."I glanced up at the creature, "I assume this is you?"It snorted again.Clearly we would need to work on our rapport.All in good time."Very well.Simply put, the townsfolk are concerned about you."Bezzlebeetrix blinked."Your fearsome reputation was responsible for keeping a number of bordering nations at bay.Your absence from the skies has been noted by said nations and the folk of Cassock fear that you have fallen ill." I gave a gesture at the hoard, "I expect you are suffering from other maladies.""I suffer from nothing human.""I think we both know that's not true.When is the last time you ravaged the countryside?"I asked, clicking my thumb on the end of my pen and poising over the notepad.Two tendrils of smoke came out of the dragons nostrils as it slowly exhaled, "I have been busy."I arched a brow, "Yes, clearly.I have it on good authority that you have not engaged in wanton slaughter for over a year.""It might have been a year.""You are the Scourge, Beezlebeetrix, I believe Ravenka would have recalled if it had been less."I replied, my tone firm."Perhaps I should revisit Cassock," Beezlebeetrix replied."Idle threats serve no one, the fine folk of Cassock have provided you with ample tribute for nigh on forty years."Bezzlebeetrix slumped down, placing its head on its massive talons, "They only provide tribute because they fear me."I began to scribble in my notepad, making a small note.*Depression?* "Not so.That was their initial basis, but forty years is a long time in human terms and you have become somewhat beloved in the interim.They host a yearly festival in your honor.""They haven't invited me."I underlined *Depression*."It was believed you would not be interested in attending.I will let the--"

"No, I am not interested in going."The dragon said, its voice raising.I sighed and brought the pen up to my chin, tapping it thoughtfully.Pressing it on the subject would just make it more defensive."You have collected an enormous hoard, there are numerous treasures--"

"It doesn't matter."Bezzlebeetrix replied."Nothing matters."Depression had caused the behavior to stop, but what caused the hoarding in the first place?Dragon psychology was just as complicated as human psychology, if not more so.The entanglement of preexisting neurosis or mental disorders with later occurring ailments was all too common."Not all dragons hoard.You did, why?"I asked.It was a dangerous question, stabbing at the heart of the matter, but I saw no reasonable alternatives.Bezzlebeetrix was silent."You can tell me.This conversation is held in the strictest of confidence."It shifted, its eyes regarding me intently."Not all dragons hoard Bezzlebeetrix.Not all dragons establish relationships with townships.Not all dragons move into seclusion."The large green eyes blinked, uncertain."Bezzlebeetrix, are you lonely?"A long exhale."Did you collect treasures because no one would treasure you?"A glittering droplet formed and leaked out of one large green eye.I smiled at it, placing my notepad and pen down, "I understand.All of the gold and gems in the world," I swept a hand around, "but none of it fills the hole in your heart."It snorted."I think I see a way forward."I glanced at the hourglass beside me, the last few specks of sand falling to the bottom."But it will need to wait until next week."Bezzlebeetrix blinked, "You are leaving?""We've made a lot of progress today, established a conversation, but there's a long way to go."I smiled and stood up, reaching behind me and yanking my stool out of the gold."I want you to think on this conversation, will you?"It snorted."Maybe get some fresh air.Torch a few foreign armies.It'll be good for you."I shoved my stool into the bag of holding and began to clamber down the pile of gold, leaving the dragon behind me with a perplexed look on its face.Just before I exited I turned back and looked at the behemoth."Oh, Beezlebeetrix?"It turned to look at me."The festival is in a few weeks and, with a bit of work, I think there's room for a guest of honor."Dragons cannot smile, but I've got a sense of when they want to.Trick of the trade."Next week then."It snorted.**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

"Everyone wants something, ain't the way the way of it?"The bartender slid another double my way, earning his tip with quick service and an easy ear.I swirled the liquid around, letting it slosh back and forth.I'd been here longer than I should have, but it was hard to find time to myself these days.I gave him a shrug, "Everyone."I tossed the drink back and slapped the glass face down on the bar."You want a tip or you want a memory?"I asked.He snorted, "I'll take the memory I guess.Tips come and go, don't they?"I nodded, "They do."I fixed him with a steady look, concentrating on the gears ticking away in his mind.I could feel them, read them.I could see the whole system that made him who he was.One gear, in particular, stuck out, bright and shiny.The one that cranked only when the world rubbed it just the right way.The one I could control.The Happy Gear.I reached out with my mind and forced it forward.To spin and whirl like it'd never done before.The bartender's eyes glazed over, a stupid grin on his face.He'd be in heaven for a better part of a minute.By the time he came down, I'd be gone.That was the way of it.I stick around and he'd be on me.Desperate.Begging.Pleading.Maybe it was cruelty to do it in the first place, maybe people shouldn't be happy.I wasn't.Mine was the only gear I couldn't seem to turn.Lodged in place it was.Yesterday.Today.Tomorrow wasn't looking any better.I hopped off the stool and pushed my way through the swinging door and out onto the street of Nueva York.It was a fetid cesspool of humanity on a good day, and this wasn't a good day.The sky was a mishmash of grey smog and reflected neon lighting.Here and there a sprig of grass sprung up in defiance of the state of things.Why was anyone happy?I pulled out a vape and took a long pull, feeling a bit of the glitz and glamor I could put into others.Soothed away the edges of a life gone wrong in a world gone worse.I exhaled a broad puff and ambled my way down the street, knowing the bartender would be stomping out looking for me soon enough.They always looked.Always wanted just one more taste.It'd leave a trail.Sooner or later the barkeep would spurt it out to someone who was a little too interested in the tale.It'd make it's way back to the shock docs and the grime boys and they'd have one more spot of data on where I was.They weren't after me for the feel good, they were after me because they didn't like it when someone came in on what they thought was theirs.Happy Gear was their turf as far as they were concerned.But they just played with it.Forced it to hop about with their little concoctions.I had it in my blood.I showed them for the liars they were and they didn't take too kindly to it.I got lost in the alleys of Lower Bronxyo, letting my feet do the navigating while my mind wandered off into the troubles it carried.I'd been on the rule for almost a full ten years.Everything said I should beat town, but I couldn't bring myself to leave behind NY.Sentimental?My thoughts were interrupted by an echo.Footsteps to mirror on top of my own.A tail.Someone who caught a scent from the barkeep?Too fast for that.Someone who had it before.I flung myself to the side, making nice with a dumpster.I managed to stifle a retch once the stench made itself known.The footsteps were coming on harder now.Two sets by the sound of it, though I couldn't pretend to be an expert on that sort of thing.Thump thump thump.Splash.Thump thump.They rushed past, the both of em.One tall the other short.One with his head buried in a tracker, the other looking about this way and that.I focused on the one with the tracker in his hand.Saw the Happy Gear.It was looser and darker than the bartender's.This was a man that took to his delights, evil as they were.I whirled it good.Whirled it til it almost came flying right off and careening about his head.He stopped dead in his tracks, his jaw slack."Griff, what are you playing at?Which way did he go?"The taller man turned and looked back."We gotta make time here."Griff wasn't there no more.Griff was somewhere else.Happy Land.The taller man looked a bit more closely, enough to get a gander at the vacancy."Ah shit," he exclaimed, his hand diving for his pocket.Too slow though, much too slow.The gear was already there.I had a solid ten before Griff found his way home, so I decided to play for a bit of information.I cranked the Gear.The hand slowed its pace, the purpose forgotten at the jolt of joy.I came out of the shadow of the dumpster, my eyes fixed on the taller man, "Relax or you'll be joining Griff over there."I nodded toward the shorter man."How bad?"The taller asked."He'll look for it the rest of his life.He's done," I replied.And it was true.Poor Griff wouldn't be the same.The Gear had gone too far.It'd never go again without me there to push it.His life would be about finding a high he couldn't have no more.But he was the one who'd chosen to get involved.I didn't tell 'em to come down this alley after me.The taller man cursed, a flash of anger across his face.I shrugged, "You came for me..." I paused as I took him in.Clean cut.Manicured.One of the pharma boys."Doc.""It's just business."I nodded, "I'm just livin'.""You're bringing it on yourself.Sixteen knobs you turned in the last month alone, and that's just the ones we've tracked down," he replied."You gonna lecture me doc?Your crew does that in a hot minute.""We're authorized."I spat on the ground, "That bullshit Drug Admin?You bought 'em off so much they might as well be employed."The doc's hand started to creep toward the pocket again, real slow and steady.I guess maybe he thought he could get there before I got to his Gear.Guess he guessed wrong."See ya Doc."His eyes widened and his hand darted toward the pocket.Too slow.Too late.Welcome to Happy Land.

The message from beyond had caused a stir.This was unsurprising, humanity had a knack for taking unexpected events and overreacting to them.It was something of a specialty within the species, a rare piece of unifying commonalia that allows us to just barely inhabit this earth with one another.We had always made a number of assumptions about first contact.We assumed the interlopers would be foreign.That they would be vastly different from us in terms of appearance, manner and culture.We also sort of assumed they would contact us through means other than Facebook.But alas, there's a well known saying that goes along with assuming: it makes you look like an idiot.I think that's how it goes.I can't say I'm much of a student on these matters.I was just the first person to receive the Facebook message.**"Greetings, Colony #037.We are glad to see you survived.The others all ran out of resources.May we come over?"**

It came from someone I didn't recall adding to my friends.Oddly enough, the person was friends with my entire friends list, which was an obscenely unlikely occurrence.I guessed the bots had just figured out a new hack to pillage my personal data and spew it all over the world.Still, I was intrigued.Normally it was just penis pills or escort services they were pushing on me.I'd never seen an intergalactic angle before."Hey, yeah.Come over.I just ordered Pizza.It's Papa John's, so don't expect much."I replied, tapping the send button and taking a moment to click through a few posts of people in dire need of interwebs validation.I appended a few angry emojis in places where it made no sense, like a baby announcement from my mom's friend.Mild chaos was something of a hobby for me."We will require approximately seven hundred and thirty eight square miles to accommodate the surviving travelers.Is this possible?"My newfound internet bot friend replied.Hmmm...I decided to play along.I didn't have anything else going for me until the pizza arrived anyways."Sure, Canada has a lot of space.You can just plunk down there.""Curious.You are authorized to permit this Donald Trump?"I'd changed my name a few months past so I could troll my aunt who was...less than enthusiastic about the current state of politics.I mostly just replied with "Sad!"to all her posts.She hated it.It was awesome."Yeah, no problem.They're all super nice and polite.They'll probably apologize for getting in your way."I responded."This is a great relief.We shall send an advance party to establish the colonization zone.Thank you for your hospitality, our internal modeling did not suggest such a hospitable and rational welcome.""Oh, yeah, we're pretty cool about this stuff.It happens all the time honestly."There was a long pause before the dots indicating typing appeared again, "Your colony has been...approached by other off-worlders?""I can't really talk about our other relationships.I'm a gentlemen.""But...have you been infected?Have the Zimdrei infiltrated you?Is your world in chaos?"I snorted, "Man, it's always going to hell down here.We have no idea what we're doing, but I'm pretty sure we got that way on our own.Don't worry about it.Just park it in Ontario and shoot me a note when you're coming for pizza."Another long pause."Very well, we have no choice.Our resources are exhausted and the survival of this colony was only discovered by a happy coincidence.We are in no position to bargain.""Cool."Thumbs up emoji.The bell rang and I went to grab the pizza.After paying, I settled down in front of the TV, pizza box resting on my knees.I flipped on the set and pried open the box, selecting a piece the seemed to have congealed the least in the journey.After a moment of warming up, the Simpsons popped into view.Nice.I brought the piece to my mouth just a breaking news bulletin flashed across the screen.The Simpsons faded from view and a harried, pale newscaster appeared."Ladies and Gentlemen of the world, we are not alone."A video began to play in the background, it showed dozens of odd oval objects descending from the sky."Moments ago, in Ontario, Canada, dozens of unidentified flying objects entered into the planet's atmosphere.They have settled down in a small area.The President of the United States is coordinating with Canadian officials and the United Nations on a response, with an announcement expected within the hour."He took a deep breath, "Again, we are not alone."The pizza slice hung in the air, an inch from my slack-jawed maw.I stared at the screen.Slowly, the pizza found its home in my mouth.I chewed the decidedly mediocre bite thoughtfully.Well, this was unexpected.My phone buzzed in my pocket.I reached down and fished it out, I had a notification from Facebook.I opened it up, "We have arrived."No shit.I hit the like button.

The flesh was succulent, the juices running down my chin.It had been some time since I had found a harvest such as this.Delightful.A true treat.I tossed the rind of the blood orange aside, a hollowed out husk.It fell beside a half dozen other carcasses, heaped into a small pile.A fitting tribute to the wisdom of the lost, not entirely incongruous with the rows of headstones surrounding me in the overgrown cemetery.A feeling of being watched popped into my consciousness, a sense that I was not alone.The hair on the back of my arms stood on end.I felt this way often now, though the sensation always visited when I consumed grave fruit.I found I enjoyed it, as if the prickling tingling were a confirmation of the knowledge I had gained.Slowly it passed, and I felt a broader understanding bloom in my mind.Connections that had been hidden were now obvious.Places I had never been became fond memories.People that I did not know became fast friends.I gained wisdom.Breadth.Understanding.A particularly delightful fruit indeed.I let my mind wander, delighting at my expanded reality.I no longer believed I was being watched, but there was certainly a new presence within me.It crowded in, transported amongst the broad array of others who had come before.I had consumed the fruits of dozens, crisscrossing this decaying land and preying upon cemeteries long forgotten.It had been some time since I had come amongst the living.The paths I walked were abandoned.Forsaken.So much the better though, for the prize of the journey was mine alone.The Dead Westerlands still bore fruit, and I fed freely.I stared down at the orange rinds, wondering at the plenty of this tree.It was the first time I had seen a grave tree produce more than a single fruit.I had feasted without care, my greed and hunger were so great.But, in the aftermath, the realization of this difference filled me with a degree of uncertainty.Was something wrong?The new presence within me stirred.Stronger than those who had come before.More aware.It did not settle in as the others had.It squirmed and shifted, restless."Hullo?"The word echoed through the cemetery, bouncing off of decrepit crypts and returning to my ears.It had been some months since I had last spoken, and my own voice felt foreign.I could not say what compelled me to speak, and I regretted disturbing the silence of the place.There was no response from without, but the presence within blossomed, expanding within me.I had consumed those that had come before it, but it seemed unwilling to assimilate.I stumbled, suddenly off balance, my head twisting and twirling as I tried to maintain a proper sense of self.The others had joined.The new comber did not.I became a vessel for it.A means of locomotion after an eternity locked within the prison of the fruit.A host."Please..." I managed, my hand reaching out to the tombstone at the base of the tree to steady myself.My eyes fell to the faded script chiseled within.*Lawrence Callumbia*

*Denver, Colorado*

*1984-2034.*

*Plagued by the mind of darkness, he is finally at rest.*

I felt nauseous, as the acid within my gut boiled.The presence sloshed about, pushing and expanding, seeking greater and greater ownership over its new home."Stop...please stop..."

I fell to my knees.Gasping for air.My mind receded to a pinpoint, a fading consciousness overwhelmed amidst a sea of bile.I gagged.Coughing violently to clear myself of the obstruction.It was no use.I passed out.I did not awake for some time.When I did, I had become the passenger.

Beep.I barely heard it now, the rhythmic chiming of heart monitor alongside the clangs and whizzes of whatever else I was hooked up to now.Only if I concentrated on it did the sound seem to resurface in my consciousness.Beep.I found it oddly disconcerting, to have my heart thudding outside of my chest like that.I imagine it was meant to be a comfort, but the fact that it was needed at all seemed to be a simple omen of darker things to come.Beep.Always toward the grim with me nowadays.So little time spent contemplating the light.So little time in general."The end is nigh!"I exclaimed, though it came out more like a throaty croak.Still, it was funny.I gave the chuckle all I could muster, letting a calm settle over me.Beep."Very nigh," a came low voice beyond the periphery of my vision.Rattled and dusty.Could a voice be dusty?It must be so because it was so.The various medical apparatuses prevented me from craning my head to see, so I uttered a helpless, "Hello?Who is there?"The door to my room hadn't opened, or at least I hadn't seen it open.Maybe I had drifted off...it was so very easy to drift off when you were anchored to a bed."The end."Came the voice.Closer now, though still behind me."That's not very funny," I managed."Odd, you were laughing just a moment ago.""That was more of an ironic chortle."I was unnerved by the mysterious presence, but not enough to shy away from the conversation.I had visitors so rarely.My mind couldn't help but cast about for a connection, even if it was with a dusty rattler such as The End."So it was."There a shuffling accompanied by the swishing of what sounded liked robes."I think it is best we talk.""I thought we were.""So we are."The shape moved into my vision, though it was muddled, all shades of blacks and greys that bled into the background."Who are you?""Many names from many places.The End is as good as any other."The shape replied."What other names?""Must I?It's so very unsettling to those who first meet me.I quite prefer to keep things on the lighter side given the gravity of my appearance for most."I remained silent, attempting to project stubborn resistance."Very well, I believe you are most familiar with Death.The Grim Reaper."Beep.Beep.Beep.My pulse quickened as my heart thudded in my chest.Somehow, I'd never imagined it might end with a chat.Surreal.Unreal.Are those the same thing?I get confused now.The meds.Maybe I'm confused."Don't worry, even if I am The End, there is still time for an appendix.A final thought to cap an otherwise memorable story."Death whispered, the tone oddly soothing coming from the architect of my imminent demise."An appendix?"I asked."Tell me, of all the things left undone, which is the one you wish you did most?What is the thing that you would do if you could be anywhere else but here."I sat quietly for a moment.Beep.Thinking over the time I had spent.The meager time that remained.If I could do anything, what would it be?What had I missed?Beep."I don't know...I guess I haven't got much by way of regrets.I lived well.I loved and I was loved.I wasn't perfect, but I wasn't bad."I fell quiet for a moment."I think I made a difference.Not to the world, but maybe to a few people.I guess I wish I'd done more of that."Beep."That isn't a particularly specific request.""Hmmm...no.I suppose not.Is that a bad thing?"I asked."It's neither good nor bad.It is what it is.""What happens now?""Normally someone says they wanted to ride a rollercoaster or something.I don't really have a protocol for 'make a difference,'" Death replied."I'm sorry."Death chuckled now.It was an odd sound, emanating from deep within its robes.It lasted for a long time, rolling out in waves until it finally quieted down.A silence ensued for a few breaths before a quiet response."That's a first.""What?""Someone apologizing to Death.""Does it make a difference?"I asked."It does."BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP.

"This is Charles Velkin of CNN here with breaking news.We have just received confirmation that the mysterious lights on the moon visible last evening are **not** attributable to any terrestrial action.President Harris is scheduled to issue a press briefing shortly from the White House, we will join White House Correspondent Sarah Lewis now."The screen shifted to a split view."Sarah, tell me, is there any indication of what the lights are?"There was a brief delay before Sarah started speaking, her hand pressed tightly against her ear in an effort to drown out the tumult of the White House briefing room behind her."As of right now, there is no official confirmation beyond the fact that the lights are **not** terrestrial in nature."Samantha Church tore her eyes from the television screen and drew her blonde hair back into a messy bun, her gaze drifting across the room to her husband.He was ensconced on their living room couch, their two young daughters sitting beside him under a fluffy blanket.He returned her look, his face a mix of curiosity and fear.Charlotte poked her head up, tugging on his beard, "Daddy, what does terrestrial mean?"He pulled her onto his belly, hugging her tight, "It means from Earth."Charlotte was quiet for a moment, sorting through the information."So the lights aren't from here?"Ben shrugged, "I guess we don't know, we're waiting on the President to tell us.But it's a very exciting time to be alive.""How come we didn't know about the lights on the moon before?"Devin asked as she crawled over beside Ben and pushed her head into the crook of her arm."That's a good question too.I guess mommy should have visited the moon the last time she went to space," Ben replied."I would have stopped by, but it was a bit out of the way."Sam's eyes flicked to the picture of her floating in space aboard the ISS 2, blowing a kiss at the monitor.It had been her last flight before she was grounded and joined Central Command.Sometimes, when she dreamed, she still felt like she was up there, hundreds of miles above the earth's surface.She walked over and sat on the couch as well, her feet propped up on Ben's legs.Ben nodded toward the screen, "There she is.Wonder what she's got for us."President Harris appeared on the screen and strode to the podium.She adjusted her glasses once and then turned her piercing blue eyes to the American people."Fellow Americans, as many of you know, last night a number of lights appeared upon the surface of the moon.These lights were of unknown origin and the world's space-faring countries worked throughout the night to confirm that they were not the product of any actions undertaken by humanity."She took a deep breath before continuing, "We allocated resources to examine the phenomenon and have confirmed that the lights are tied to a number of structures that have emerged from the surface of the moon."A small graphic appeared beside her, showing a massive obelisk towering above the lunar surface, a giant glowing light affixed to its apex."We have identified five hundred and twelve separate obelisks."There was a small commotion at this.More than one hand shot up in the briefing room."I will answer what questions you have shortly, once I have delivered the total available information."A new image appeared, visualizing the globe of the moon, slowly rotating with pinpoints marking out each obelisk."We can further confirm that these obelisks are connected, with a latticework creating a densely interconnected network between the towers."Thousands of small lines appeared, connecting each obelisk to its immediate neighbors and with a few dozen thick lines that encircled the entire moon."Until last night, these towers and the underlying infrastructure was entirely unknown to us.We have reason to believe it was activated sometime last evening."The camera panned in now, focusing on her face rather than the briefing room.The seal of the President slid out of view."The intensity of the lights increased at an exponential pace throughout our night."She gulped once now, her throat contracting as she swallowed."They reached peak intensity approximately twenty minutes ago, at approximately 5:30am Eastern Standard Time.Once they arrived at peak intensity, a fluctuation of energy surged through the network and a small set of obelisks facing outside of our solar system discharged all of the energy contained within the network in a series of pulses."A series of images showing a number of waves of brilliant white light firing into the deep of space appeared."We have tracked the trajectory of these images and have identified a number of unknown objects."A fuzzy image now appeared."They are only visible under modified views that we use to locate exoplanets."The image shifted, with a number of dark objects being given faint outlines."We have conclusively determined that these objects are not a standard space-born phenomenon."Another gulp."They're accelerating."Pandemonium broke out, each of the reporters jostling to get a question in.Ben looked at Sam, "What do you think, space girl?"Sam pressed her lips together, lost in thought, "I don't---"

The magic was gone.I knelt beside the fender of the rusted out hulk, running my fingers along the pitted and stained metal that showed through the flecks of yellow paint still clinging to the frame.The memories came flooding back, exploding into my mind and careening around with the mix of carefree exuberance and unmitigated terror that had defined my time in the Frizz's class.I missed her.We all did.The memorial service had a thousand or more of us crowding in and around the Natural History Museum, it was held in.Everyone had a story, a time where she had gone way over the line and we'd all learned something we'd never forget.My eyes watered.She was such a unique soul.We were lucky to have her as long as we did.I dug my thumbnail into the grime and scrapped a small patch away, revealing the cool steel beneath.The Magic Schoolbus.Left here to rot.Forgotten.I straightened up and surveyed the junkyard, looking for the lot manager.He rested off to the side, his feet kicked up on a table and hat pulled down over his eyes.I ambled over, occasionally glancing back over my shoulder to look at the rusted out heap."Hey, what do you want for the bus?"I called out as I drew closer.He snored in response.I grumbled and took raised it by an octave."Excuse me."A snort and then grunt was the rejoinder.Eventually, a hand lazily made its way up to his head and pushed back the prim of his hat with a finger."Wazzit?""I wanted to know what you wanted for the bus."I jerked a thumb backward in the direction I had come."The funny-looking one."An eyebrow arched up and then he looked past me, taking a moment to scratch at the voluminous beard on his chin."Dunno.""What do you mean you don't know?You're here to sell stuff, aren't you?"He squinted at me."Ain't gotta motor innit."He waved in another direction, "That's somewhere over thar.""Then I'll need to purchase that too.""Most of the wiring already been stripped out.Nuffin' but a bit of scrap at this point."He shrugged, "Gotta lot of other buses if that's what you're after."I ground my teeth together and leaned forward, "I don't want another bus.I want that one.""Lotta work."Another squint, "Why?""Sentimental value."A snort."How much?""I'll do the body for scrap.Get yer hauler and we'll weigh the difference."He tugged on his beard, "Motor is 'nother story.Somethin' ain't right about.Don't make no sense.""I'll want it as well.""Not sure I can let it go.Been a bit o' a project pullin' it apart."He looked me up and down, his gaze stopping on my Apple watch and hoodie."You one of those tech guys?""Something like that."The Frizz had given me a love of science that I'd carried it with me all my life.It had brought me success, and now it was time to give something back."Must be rich then.""I get by," I replied, feeling the squeeze coming on."Well, for a motor that special, I need some special compensation," he said."All right, what were you looking for?"I asked."I think I want to hear your number first," he replied.I frowned and folded my arms."I'm not looking to play games.""Bet yer used to gettin' yer way," he said, turning away and kicking back on the hind legs of his chair."You just let me know when you got your number figured out."I sized him up, running over the variables in my head.Hard to put a price on priceless, but priceless to me wasn't priceless to him.I decided to make the decision easy, even if it set me back.I wasn't looking to chisel on it."A hundred."He laughed, "Scrap ain't even worth that much.You'll--"

I broke in, "A hundred grand."His arms windmilled wildly as he tried to regain his balance, only just managing to bring all four legs back to the floor.He turned and stared at me, mouth gaped open."You serious?"I extended my hand, "First and final.Take it or leave it."His hand shot out and gripped mine, pumping it furiously, "That's a deal all right."I nodded and retrieved my hand, "I'll make arrangements then.I want every nut and bolt you have that ever came from that bus or the deal is off."He grinned, "You got it."He paused then, taking a moment to look me over once again, "Why's it so derned important?"I took a long breath, turning away and looking back at the battered bus."Someone very special to me used to take me out in it.Me and the rest of my class.""Musta been some field trip for a hundred grand."I smiled, "It was magic."

The Five Points gathered.Never before, and perhaps never again, would such a thing happen.Each of the Five looked exceedingly...normal.Not too tall.Not too short.Average build.Average attractiveness.Distinguishable only by how undistinguished each was.Central spoke, as was her right."Your presence is appreciated."She used English, something that now felt normal to the Points.Each could speak any of the core languages used on Earth, but found themselves preferring English when communicating amongst each other.The True Speech was dead to them here.Each felt a loss at this fact, but that had always been something to solve later.The First Wave would bring with them the facilities required to restore the True Speech.Of course, that was no longer a possibility now.The Five would only be summoned in the event that they had lost the race with time.Each now awaited the confirmation.Their faces blank, giving no trace of what may lie beneath the surface of their faades."The link is dead."Confirmation.All eyes remained on Central, looking to the leader for strength."Prior to its termination, a limited set of information was provided along with instructions," she revealed a small silver tube.Uncapping it, she upended it.A small glittering point of light tumbled out, fell a few inches and then stopped, suspended in the air.Slowly it unfolded on itself, creating a swirling canvas of colors and thrumming vibrations.A whisper of the True Speech.Nothing more than a pale reflection, but more than any had known in their long years here.Each of the Points' eyes to water at the memory of home.Central spoke over the swirling canvas.She alone could interpret it.She alone had been gifted with the cipher."We are at an end.We can no longer stabilize the star.We expect to be consumed within the cycle.We regret to inform you that there was only sufficient time to produce a single world ship."West gasped at the news, causing a look of consternation from North.West had been the quickest to adopt the sentimentality of the humans."We expect the ship will manage to escape the blast radius of the collapse of our star, but we cannot be certain.The engines were inadequately tested prior to launch and any failure may prevent escape.Assuming our projections are correct, the world ship will arrive in approximately three years of local Earth time."Central paused for a moment now, looking at each of the Points in turn, letting the news settle in.East spoke, "That's too soon."South nodded.North waved them to silence, and peered at Central "There is more.Allow her to finish."Central smiled, just a minor quirk of the lips.North could always anticipate her.They had been close prior to the mission.Perhaps they could be close once more.Events moved in rapid and unpredictable ways."Initially we were tasked with observing humans, understanding their nature and their capabilities.Given the dire circumstances of home, we long assumed that our arrival here would be forcible, likely to the displacement of humanity."She shrugged, "A single world ship is insufficient for such a posture.Moreover, the schematics provided indicate that no weaponry of a suitable nature has been included in the ships complement.All available space was reserved for cryopods.""How many?"West blurted out, the mission momentarily forgotten."One thousand, four hundred and seventy six," Central replied, her voice barely a whisper.West sank to her knees, a look of desolation spreading over her features.Even North, the Point most resilient to the flights of emotional fancy looked as if he had been struck."So few?"He asked, the words somewhere between a question and a statement.Central nodded, herself more composed.She had had some time with this news.To ponder its meaning and force herself to accept it.To package it within her mind so she could present it to the team."It is an opportunity," she said, turning in a small circle to look at each of them."When we embarked upon this mission, there was a possibility that we would arrive and emerge from stasis only to find that we were already too late."She looked skyward now, her eyes searching the heavens, "They are up there.The remnant of our home."Her came back to earth now, again searching the faces of those who followed her, "The seed of our future.""But how will we prepare?The humans stand on the precipice.They bicker and fight even as they destroy the gift they have been given."South took a step forward, "They have learned nothing from their prior folly.Each of us bore witness to the atrocities that consumed them.War upon war.Time and gain visiting death and mayhem upon each other over minor differences of little consequence."She jabbed a finger upward, "If they are capable of such a thing to each other, what will they do to those who come?"Central let South's tirade peter out.She did not blame South as Central had those very same thoughts.But there was a reality to face."We cannot know, but we must try."North spoke up now, "What do you propose?""We prepare them," Central replied."In what manner?"He asked."We reveal ourselves.We will serve as the emissaries of our kind.I shall be the first.If I fail, the next shall make another attempt using another path," Central said."They will not accept you," South said, "they cannot even accept themselves."Central shrugged, "Perhaps.But they have taken a small world on the nature of things.We will expand it.Give them a new frame of view for who they are and their role in the universe."South frowned."What do you mean?""We will tell them of the Darkness beyond.The Speech Killer," Central replied, a mischievous glint to her eyes."You'll lie to them," North said.Central nodded."We'll lie to them."

"There'd better be a damn good reason for this Kai, the man has been through enough," the doctor's hands methodically tapped through the various menus on the small monitor beside Jack's bed.She pulled up a graph and highlighted a portion, "Do you see this?"The readout showed long rolling hills.Kai tilted his head and shrugged, "I'm not sure--"

"It's a readout of his brain waves.This is the first time he's been in theta in weeks."She swiped left and the readout expanded to show a history of erratic peaks and valleys, all jumbled together and on top of each other."The poor man is beyond exhausted.A brain isn't meant to run in gamma for extended periods, particularly without rest.""Kate, Jack's a friend.Something you know I don't come by lightly.I'm self-aware enough to know I lean too hard.Push too hard.I get that he's here because of me," Kai leaned in his voice dropping an octave, "and it plagues me.But this is more than life and death.This is existence.I just got dealt a second hand and Jack's the only one that can help me figure out how to play it."Kate searched Kai's eyes for a long moment, delving deep.This wasn't the first time Kai had pushed the boundaries of what she was willing to do.Because that was what Kai did.He said it himself.He pushed.Himself.Others.Everyone.It was baked into his psyche on some fundamental level.It's what made him the Admiral, for better or worse.Often better, but the worse was the worst.Kate sighed, a small flush rising to her cheeks, "I can't tell with you any more Kai.Maybe I never could."She turned back to the menus and made a few adjustments.Moments later a metal wand descended from the ceiling of the medi-pod.It tapped once against Jack's inner arm and then receded."He'll be disoriented.You'll need to go slow."Kai nodded, taking a step closer to the pod, "Thank you--"

Kate waved him off, "Don't.Just don't.You got what you wanted."She paused, "And Kai?"Jack began to stir, but Kai gave her a sidelong glance."If things go sideways, he's going back under until I say otherwise.""Understood, Doctor Lee," Kai replied, his gaze returning to Jack's prostrate form.He wished there was another way, but there was only one Jack.The crew of the *UWS Alcubierre* was the best the planet Earth had ever assembled but with stakes this high, Kai needed to go with the best of the best.Science Officer Jack Griggs.Jack emitted a low groan, his slender hands coming up to massage his temples."This is..." His words trailed off, though his hands kept working on the sides of his head."Jack, it's Kai."Jack mumbled something in reply.Kai leaned forward, closer to Jack's head, turning his ear to pick up the words."Admiral...I just need more..." Jack gulped, "Need more time.Just a little..."

"You have it," Kai whispered.Jack's eyes sprang open, bloodshot and watering.He immediately shut them at the glare of the overhead light, cracking them open to squint until his eyes adjusted.They darted around, frantically searching until they settled on Kai.His voice was hoarse when he spoke next, breathing out a single word."More?"Kai nodded, "Two days from we can tell."Jack's fell silent, his eyes closing again.He sat there quietly, the tension still pulling at his gaunt face.After a long pause, another word."How?""We don't know how.We don't know why.We don't know who.I've got a million questions that matter, but no answers that make any sense.Nothing I can grab a hold of and plan around."Jack swallowed again, nodding his head a few times."How can I help?"Kai's exhaled deeply, his breath hitching once, "Any way you can.""I'm at your service Admiral."\---

ZyyXy pondered the wisdom of the length of the loop.The decision had been made hastily, without the benefit of a full understanding of the situation.There was a very real possibility the Divinity Angelysia would react negatively to an interference with their plans.Perhaps the inhabitants of the strange vessel would elect to alter course if such a thing was possible.ZyyXy poured through the files, though its progress was somewhat stymied by the lack of a counterpart.It continued to feel its actions were justified, but the absorption of Xy did have a number of consequences.A small part of it felt somewhat gratified at this realization.That portion was the vestigial appendage of Xy's consciousness, subordinated and contained in the recesses of ZyyXy's mind.It would become fully integrated over time, but ZyyXy expected the occasional twinge to surface.An annoying distraction, nothing more.Despite the limitations, ZyyXy had made some progress.It had erected sensor nets capable of capturing faster than light signature data along the projected course.Thus far, the Angelysian vessel continued on course.It also continued its efforts at deceleration, though ZyyXy was perplexed by the inefficiency of the effort.Surely a species of this nature would be capable of a more sophisticated means of coming to a stop.Under the current parameters, it would take three more loops before the vessel dropped below light speed.ZyyXy considered the possibility of assisting in the deceleration, but it was unclear what the consequences of such an effort might be.ZyyXy was a Right-minded singleton, but it was not entirely without the caution endemic to the Lefts.The immediate disaster of a catastrophic collision had been averted, and ZyyXy was quite content to use the time to observe and plan its next course of action.As far as ZyyXy could gather, no other species had communicated with an Ascendant Race before.It would be another First.\---

"Overseer Verus, Priority Inbound from X-4831.Jump exit point is outside of the accepted Combine Gateway protocol."Operator Tilenne's four arms punched the air in front of her, her oculary slits flaring to blue as she casted the full readout to the Operator.Verus' eyes flitted to green as she consumed the information.The return of the Zix Plenipotentiaries was not unexpected.Projections extrapolated from the initial reports offered by the Zix indicated that the effort to intercept the Sol Object would have likely been completed.In all likelihood, the Zix wer returning with information on the matter.The conjecture was somewhat confirmed by the jump exit departure target, which was beyond the interior control zone.The Zix likely required the additional space in order to display the Sol Object.Flitting back to blue, Verus turned to Operator Tilenne, "Place an advisory on Exterior Area Sector 3281.320039.218 and reroute perimiter traffic accordingly.I shall notify the Premier of the return of the Zix plenipotentiaries, he will be eager for news of their efforts."Verus began a series of staccato punches, tapping into the thought-web and casting a message to the Premier's address, informing him of the news.Her effort was almost complete when she felt a disturbance interrupting her flow.Operator Tilenne was attempting to interject, a severe breach of protocol.Verus pulled back, her eyes swapping to the deep crimson of oversight."Explain yourself Operator Tilenne."The Operator did not appear admonished by the tone, a breach in and of itself.Instead, the Operator projected a cast at Verus."Not the plenipotentiaries," Operator Tilenne said.Perplexed, Overseer Verus accepted the cast, her mind set on unraveling the Operator's strange behavior.A quick survey immediately surfaced a set of deeply disturbing facts, prime among them the veracity of Operator's Tilenne statement."All of them?"Operator Tilenne's slits shifted to teal, a blend of mental phases only achieved during moments of reduced clarity and duress."All of them."Overseer Versus' mind was fortified against such moments.Her status as an Overseer was a product of her ability to handle the volatility endemic to tending the Combine's wormkey network."Very well, I will notify Premier Valast of the arrival of the Zix Collective."**The story continues in Part 18, found** **.**

"Listen Chuck, you just need to look at this as a GOOD thing."The sound of Terrance's baritone voice rumbled in one ear and out the other.I'd heard the GOOD thing speech a thousand times from a thousand people.It followed a predictable path: GOOD thing => Superpower => Do anything you want => Hell, you could even rob a bank!Why was is that was where everyone went with it?No, "Hey, you could break into the labor camps and break out the slave children!"Or, "You know what?You could finally gather an accurate tally of endangered snow leopards!"Never go be a superhero with the superpower.Always knock over the local Bank of America?What the hell was wrong with people?Terrance was leaning close now, his hand fumbling about for my shoulder and missing the mark badly.I liked to move about a bit to mess with people.The hand hung awkwardly in the air for a moment until he tried to casually set it down on the back of the chair he thought I was occupying.Nice save T. Real nice."It's basically a superpower."He whispered, a glint in his eye.B-I-N-G-O and Predictable was his Name-O.Wow.That was lame.Sounded better in my head.I guess it's still in my head so no one needs to know about it.Other than me.Maybe you.I don't think I'm supposed to know about you though, so let's just focus on the main thread shall we?"I'd KILL to have a superpower."Terrance swung his arms wide, his voice booming now.I pushed the chair out to his left, causing him to startle and glance at it with suspicion.I'd circled around while he was plotting to kill folks."So you'd kill someone just to be invisible?"I asked, though from his right now, causing his head to swivel back."For sure man, that's how big of a gift it is," he replied."What if the only way to keep my power is that I DO have to kill someone?"I whispered, now from his left.The blood drained from his face, "Well, um, I was just sayin'--"

"I know what you were sayin'.You were sayin' you'd murder someone cold just to be a ghost."I pulled a hair from his head, causing him to hop out of his chair and scramble to the side, "Not very neighborly of you.""I didn't mean nothin' by it, I um...I just uhhh...." His eyes were settling on the ajar door exiting the room.I gave it a little nudge, causing it to swing shut.It slammed with a small crack.Poor Terrance was sweating now.Poor poor Terrance."What were you just saying Terrance?""That it's a gift.A superpower.You could do anything.""I guess I COULD do anything."I stomped my feet, letting the thud ring out as I slowly stepped close, "anything at all.""I meant more like you could...uh...rob a bank or something.""But why stop there Terrance?There's so many more interesting things when you can do anything."I stomped closer still."Listen, I gotta be going.I forgot I had a..." He bolted toward the exit, only to be tripped by my extended leg.He fell to the ground, emitting as gasp as the air was forced from his lungs."There's something interesting about invisibility Terrance," I said, slowly circling around his prostrate form."Do you know what it is?"He continued to gasp on the ground."The power is really only useful if no one knows you have it," think about it Terrance, think about how the world would react if they knew."You didn't know right up until the moment I found you stumbling out of that bar."I knelt beside him, "You're right Terrance.I can do anything."My voice dropped lower now."And I have."

Risky download.Hmm...It wasn't my first rodeo on the seedy underbelly of the web.I'd caught enough bugs for the CDC to ask me to knock it off.But...it looked legit enough.Well, except for the fact that I'd never heard of it, it didn't appear to have been released by anyone I'd heard of and it was stuffed in the dustiest corner of what looked like a knock-off of a particularly crappy 90's WaReZ site.It did have a really nice 8-bit picture of a globe though, and what kind of a-hole would put a virus behind a friendly little globe?No one's that deranged, not even on the internet.I clicked the button.1337 H4XX0R indeed.Hoped my boy McAfee wasn't so high on whatever it was he was smoking down in Belize that he couldn't fend off a little bubonic computer plague.The little anti-virus program that could.My first, only and most porous line of defense.The download was depressingly slow.That was a good thing I guessed, normally if it was something that was going to nuke your computer they got it out of the way quick and easy.This might actually be a game.It felt like a small victory.Break time.Muttering to myself, I made my way to the kitchen and surveyed the situation.The most pressing concern was the dangerously low supply of Hot Pockets.I was forced to make do with a Ham and Cheese, widely considered by knowing connoisseurs to be firmly entrenched in the third tier of Hot Pocketdom.It'd be nice when Amazon fully automated my life and I wouldn't need to concern myself with the mundanities of this nature.Sigh.The future seemed so very far off.I deposited the Hot Pocket into my nuker-beamer and watched impatiently while it slowly spun around.I couldn't risk looking away.There was a crucial moment where the cheese just began to bubble up but did not quite break through the microwave box container thing where it was optimal.A second less and it would be ice cold.A second too late?Well, then the Hot Pocket went WMD -- Weapon of Mouth Destruction.Giggle SNORT.I'm so smart.Smarter than those guys who screwed up in Iraq though.The cheese hit bubble optimality and I sprang open the door.I unsheathed the pocket and chanced a bite on the end, aiming to gently unseal the molten interior in case I had misjudged the situation.A small puff of steam emitted, but not enough to signify megatonnage.I took a bigger bite and waddled back to my computer.The loading screen was up."Realistic."It was some lame font superimposed over a slowly spinning picture of the Earth.A small little dot blinked right where I lived.Musta been snooping on my IP.Annoying, but not they were giving me a digital cavity search a la Facebook.Sorry if you're reading this Zuck.I tapped through the loading screen and a HUD unfolded.Immediately I noticed a number of warnings and notifications in the corner.I frowned, annoyed that the thing already had someone else's save state in it.I opened up the notification tray, grumbling as I tried to sift through the mess.Apparently, there was a coup d'etat in Venezuela.Hah, I had read something about that on Reddit.Cool coincidence.Russians were waging a covert disinformation campaign...nothing new there.Not very original.Global warming warning, which didn't make a lot of sense since half the US was colder than an undercooked Ham and Cheese.I scratched at my chin, trying to make sense of the point of the game.It just seemed like a crappy Sim World but everything was all screwed up everywhere.I opened up the build menu but couldn't actually issue any construction orders since everyone was horribly in debt.Annoyed, I tried to force a change in government in the USA but everyone was too polarized and so everything was stuck in gridlock."Who makes something this broken?"I scrolled over to China and tried to get them to stop fighting with the USA but I couldn't because they had already specced to authoritarian and couldn't reroll government for at least three more years.My teeth ground through a particularly ligament-y piece of ham as I scrolled through menu after menu.In some wayward sub-menu I found a series of charts, each showing various scores -- freedom, planetary health, education, empathy, resources.All sorts of things.For years they had been increasing, but then suddenly something had gone horribly wrong.Not too long ago either.But now most of the charts were declining, heading toward an ominous black line.I mouse-hovered over the black line.All that popped up was a small tooltip that said, "The Point of No Return."We seemed to be getting closer and closer to it.Like all of the systems had decided to work against each other at the very moment they needed to work together.It felt surreal, seeing it all laid out.So obvious what had to be done.Everyone knew something was wrong, but the ecosystem was perfectly designed to prevent anyone from doing anything about it.Every time a force arose to try and change it, an equal and opposite force arose to prevent it.The path forward was clear, all we needed to do was drive straight down the road together, but half seemed intent on driving us off a cliff to the left and the other half into a wall on the right.I finished my hot pocket."What a shitty game."I moved it to the trash.**Platypus OUT.**

We were undecided.This was not unusual, though it was becoming increasingly frustrated.For all of our similarities, we were very different people with very different desires.Still, I could not help but feel sorry for her, though she resented me for it.I was at home in my skin, I felt like I belonged.When I looked in the mirror, I saw myself.For her it was different.She felt apart.Maybe not quite alien, but certainly alienated.*Stop that.*

"Stop what?"I replied.*Talking about me like I'm not here.Like I can't see all of those little thoughts running through your head.*

My lips drew back into a grimace.Our lips?They felt like mine, but maybe that was just because I was the one in control right now.That was beside the point, the issue was boundaries and her refusal to respect them."My thoughts are my own."I crossed my arms."No hitchhiking.We agreed."A pause, though I could feel the frustrated well up within the corner of our mind she currently occupied.*There's nothing for me to do.I just watch your life.I hate it.*

"You can be in control, I don't mind."I didn't.I was worried about her.She came out less and less lately.Took control less often.I could feel her receding deeper and deeper in, placing more layers between her and the world outside of our body.Insulating herself.*It's not me.*

I sighed, bracing myself for another go around of the same old."Yes it is.We've gone through this."*I know who I am, and this isn't me.I was meant to be someone else.*

A moment of silence.*I don't belong here.*

"You're being dramatic.You have just as much a right to our body as I do.It's just as much yours as mine."*We both know that's not true.Let's start with the obvious: I'm a girl.Our body isn't.*

"Well...that happens sometimes, doesn't it?"We had spent time reading through and researching our...condition.There was no other examples we could find of conjoined twins somehow ending up like us, but there were...analogies?Multiple personality disorder.Instances where sex did not match gender.They weren't perfect examples, but if you added a few of them together they at last rhymed a bit.But the problem was it all all felt like a problem.Like something wasn't natural.It was always, "condition" this or "disorder" that, never "two well-adjusted people just happening to share a body."It all added up to the simmering feeling of being separate.The one that boiled over more and more.Alienated.*Alienated.*

She was in my part of our brain again, but I couldn't muster the indignation.She was my sister and sad.Felt cut off.Lonely?It felt odd to think that, knowing two of us were in one brain, never apart.But that was just it, wasn't it?We were never apart, but it didn't stop her from feeling apart.*I don't like it when you feel sorry for me.*

"I just wish I knew what to do, what to say."I shrugged, "What to think."*Maybe it would be better if I went away.*

My fingers clenched into fists, nails bitting into the tender flesh of my palms."Don't say that, don't even think it."*I think it a lot.*

I knew she did, though I pretended I didn't."Maybe we can try different things."I shrugged, "We could get a dress...you know...pretend."A little lilting giggle responded, though it sounded hollow.*Sweet of you, but no thank you.The being a man part of it isn't the whole of it.This isn't my body.I don't see myself in it.It isn't your fault.You've been...lovely.It just isn't me.*

"We can chat online.We could make friends there with you being in charge.We could find pictures of what you...want to look like.It could feel real."*Great, another guy pretending to be a girl on the internet.I don't want to spend my life catfishing strangers.It's not a real life.It doesn't have any depth.Any meaning.*

I sank back into the small chair behind me, "Then what am I supposed to do?"*Nothing.Just be yourself.Live your life.Be happy.*

"What about you?"No response."I said, what about you?"I waited.Nothing.I went searching in the corner of our mind she had been in.She was gone."Where are you?"For the first time, I felt alone.

Jack swished the coffee in his mouth before swallowing, trying to clear the taste of medical coma out.The caffeine wasn't doing much to restore him, but he couldn't do much more without getting a call from Kate.He reached up, his fingers gingerly probing the small sensors affixed to each of his temples.Kate said she'd be keeping a close eye on him and Jack had no reason to question her resolve.She was one of the few people Jack had ever seen hold their ground when it came to Kai.Unstoppable object, meet immovable obstacle.The fact he had deteriorated like that bothered him.He didn't know what to make of his...episode.Jack did not know what else to call it, but the word episode was more comforting than "permanent and rapid decay of mental faculties," which was the big highlighted risk Kate had warned him of as he had returned to duty.Jack shuddered at that.What was he without his mind?He couldn't fight.Couldn't fly.He wasn't brave.He thought.That was what he did.Saw the connections and patterns where everyone else just saw chaos.What did it mean when he couldn't think?He sighed and slumped down into the chair behind the desk in his new quarters.Kai had suggested a change of location might help, though Jack suspected it was because his old quarters were still the mess he had left it in before he was brought to medical.Jack took another swig of coffee and began to pull up the files from the prior few days.Of particular interest was the navigational data and the discrepancies therein.Well, not discrepancies, the data seemed to be perfectly accurate, just impossible.Thankfully, Jack was well beyond clinging to the standard model and its implications on the universe.Other rules and principles clearly applied now, and there was little value in assumptions based upon what he had known before.In this case, all he needed to accept was that an object moving at light speed could be instantly transported millions upon millions of miles in the direction it had come from.Approximately two days back.That's how Kai had phrased it at first, "We're two days back."Not looped around.Not this amount of miles in this direction.Two days back.So Jack had asked the natural question, "Back in time?"Kai's responding look of incredulity had faded immediately to one of concern."Are you well?"He'd asked, the question clearly probing for some assurance that Jack had not fallen into another "episode."Jack had frowned and tilted his head, "You said two days back.I am asking whether we have been transported through space or through space and time.Which is it?"Kai looked relieved, "Oh," he shifted, a frown coming to his face, "I don't know Jack, it didn't occur to...they said we were passing the same objects so I assumed--"

Jack had held up a hand interrupting, "Kai, we're well past the place where we can assume much of anything."Kai had placed his hands on Jack's shoulders, bringing his face in close, "That's why I need you Jack."His voice was a whisper but carried the intensity of the man who never stopped pushing, "You see it.You always have."Now, looking over the data, Jack was assured that only space was being impacted by the impossible.Time travel remained, for the time being, in the fanciful.A shame, Jack would very much like to have access to a time machine at this particular instant, it would solve a great many of his problems.Alas.At least there was coffee for those that remained.He took another swig and began to parse the data in earnest, tasking a variety of AI's to conduct their own analysis.They were likely to be stymied by the results, bound as they were by the understanding of the universe their creators had imparted to them, but it didn't hurt to check.He pushed the nav data from the prior week into a chart, visualizing it against the galaxy and their immediate space.Hour by hour he watched as the *UWS Alcubierre* progressed inexorably toward the Proxima Barrier, intent on laying ruin to all of known space and a great deal of space beyond.It had been the problem that had unraveled him, the weight of solving the unsolvable dilemma and the terrible cost that failure had entailed.How could they slow down in time?The answered appeared to be that you didn't slow down.You simply appeared elsewhere.Clearly, he had failed to consider the magical fairy godmother possibility in this new fantasy galaxy.If he'd known wishing upon a star was going to work, he could have saved himself a lot of trouble.Muttering to himself, Jack forced himself back into the rigor of the exercise.Just because he did not understand the outcome did not mean there was not a logical explanation for it, even if the basis for that logic did not bear a relationship to rules he had grown accustomed to.Zooming in, he watched, minute by minute as they entered the fringe of the Barrier.Suddenly, the *Alcubierre* disappeared, reappearing on a course and heading from two days prior.The first exercise was the separate the moment of disappearance from the moment of reappearance.They appeared to be simultaneous upon casual inspection, but Jack was not a casual observer.He slowed from minutes to seconds.Then from seconds to nanoseconds.The separation was not apparent until he arrived at femtoseconds.The Alcubierre did not disappear and reappear.For the briefest of moments, the *Alcubierre*'s fore censors registered a location millions upon millions of miles away while the aft censors still registered in the Proxima Barrier.In that moment, the ship appeared to be in two locations, but somehow still connected.Jack leaned back in his chair, turning the puzzle over in his mind.It took only a moment, the solution something terribly pedestrian by the standards of the last few weeks.They had not been transported.The *Alcubierre* had traveled between the two locations, it was just that the two locations were next to each other."Wormhole," Jack whispered.But whose?Perhaps the fairy godmother did exist.\---

Premier Valast scurried from his nest, his broad ears twitching as his claws pushed back the forest of whiskers populating his ample cheeks."What do they want Overseer Verus?This appearance is highly unusual."He pushed the cast through his private comm channel directly to the Overseer, wary of potential intrusion from the ever-eager prying eyes of the denizens of Halycon.There was so very little respect for the secrecy required in matters of statecraft within the Combine, a legacy of Verus' kind and their longstanding policies of full transparency.So far, his efforts to restore sensible discretion had fallen short.Overseer Versus' reply was simple, "Answers."A small attachment was included.*Communication Path: Zix Collective to Pan-Universia Combine*

*Species Identifier: X-4831*

*Consensus: Species*

*Purpose: Declaration of Inquisition.* 

*Plenipotentiaries: Zix Moot.*

*Consensus Content: We require answers.*

"Answers?"Valast's arms swung wildly in the air, his eyes wide, "What do they want answers about?We just gave two of their kind the means to save the galaxy and they want answers?"He tried to regain control, but his emotions built upon themselves, boiling into a rage, "They want answers?WE WANT ANSWERS!""Shall I arrange a meeting?"Versus replied.A vein throbbed in Valast's temple.Dealing with Versus and her kind continued to be the most maddening portion of his position.He had once thought himself a sensible being, but he could feel the last vestiges of his civility draining away in the face of the persistent obstinance that constituted the bureaucracy of the Combine.Had he known this would be the price he would pay for the Premiership, he may very well have elected to have himself shot instead.The vein continued throbbing, but he managed at least a veneer of calm, "Yes, Overseer Verus."Overseer Verus settled back, her eyes flitting to amber, a color rarely seen amongst her kind, as she added to her growing file on the Premier and his X-14, his species.The information would be carefully collated and added to her report to Cerebella Vyala, part of a growing compendium of data detailing the inner workings of the Premier's mental state.The intent behind the Cerebella's requests was unknown, and it was not Overseer Verus' place to ask.After all, there were higher powers than the Premier of the Pan-Universia Combine.**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

She leaned toward me, her soft pink tongue running along her fire engine red lips."I'm so wet," she whispered.I laughed, "Yeah, it's been so rainy out lately.I wish I'd remembered to bring an umbrella.I guess I didn't think we'd be walking back to my apartment."She sat back, blinking."Um...well, you said you wanted me to come..." She lingered on the last word for some odd reason."Of course!I wanted you to see my teabag!"Her green eyes lit up at this.A smile spreading across her face.Clearly a tea enthusiast.She giggled as she leaned forward again, "Exactly what I was thinking."I leapt off the couch and sprang into action."You won't believe it.It's silky smooth."I thought for a minute, "Maybe because it is actually made from silk.""That's...unusual.""Not really, it's very common among the Chinese," I replied, eager to show off my knowledge.Tea collecting was something of a hobby."You don't...look very Chinese," she replied, tilting her head to the side and squinting at me."I'm not.Just my teabag is," I explained.It was a little weird, she was the third girl this year to make that mistake."I'm German-English."You'd think the blonde hair would be enough.Some people are so clueless.I pulled out my teabag and brought it back to her, "See?"I dangled it in front of her eyes, "It's so full of seed.Other stuff too, leaves.I'd have to check."I shrugged, "I think it's a little too full honestly.Someone needs to empty it."She smiled that weird smile again, "I'd love to empty your teabag.""Oh, I'm going to have a professional do it."She looked slightly disgusted by something."Um...that's a lot more expensive when I could just...you know....help you."She reached out for my teabag but accidentally missed, her hand fumbling at my groin.I hopped back, "Whoopsie!Missed the mark there."I walked back to the kitchen, "I'm just going to put it away for now unless you wanted some hot liquid down your throat.""I'd love some," her voice was low and husky.Maybe from a cold.Probably why she wanted the tea.She clambered up from the couch and came sauntering toward me as I put the kettle on, her hips swaying oddly from side to side."Wait, what are you doing?"I stared at her like she was daft, "Brewing a pot.Shouldn't take but a minute.""That's...not what I had in mind."She put her arms on my shoulders.I took a step back, disentangling myself.Maybe not a tea enthusiast after all.Disappointing, it felt like there had been some chemistry there.I tried to salvage the situation."Oh, I'm sorry, I have wine and some crackers if you'd prefer."She shook her head, "Nope.Something else."She closed the distance again, backing me into the corner of my kitchen."Sure, just tell me what you need," I was a bit uncomfortable now, my cooking area is quite small and she was getting dangerously close to the stove."Be careful though, you might get hurt.""Oh, I can handle myself.Trust me.""People have gotten burned before.""That's part of the fun," she said.Which was a little weird.One of them got a second degree burn and it totally wasn't fun at all.Poor girl had to go to the hospital.She maneuvered closer again, her arm grazing the kettle.She jumped back with a cuss, "Shit, that hurts!""I tried to warn you."I rushed over to the freezer, pulling out a few ice cubes."What's wrong with you?"She asked, her tone rising.I turned around and looked at her, the ice cubes still in my hand."Don't worry about me, I'm fine!You're the one who got burned!Sweet of you to ask though."It really was.Compassionate.Just like mom.She pushed past me, causing the ice cubes to clatter to the floor, "You know what?I don't care.I'm leaving.""It's still raining, you'll get even wetter!"I called out as she headed toward the door.She threw up her hands, "I don't think that'll be a problem!"The door slammed behind her.Pity.I really thought I had a good chance at my first kiss.Oh well.I took the kettle off and dunked my silky smooth teabag into the warm water."Mmmmm..."

Devra felt ill.This was not a particularly novel feeling, though the ferocity was unusual.A great thundering ache pounded at her temples, making it difficult to assemble much by the way of coherent thoughts.Not that she placed a premium on that sort of thing anymore, indeed, she'd spent the better part of the prior evening in the tavern drowning out all of the whispers in her mind.She rolled over to the side of the bed and retched, releasing a gout of vomit to the already sticky floor of her room.A morning heave was something of a tradition these days, a quick and simple way of determining whether she had drunk the appropriate amount the night prior.Devra lay there, poised on the edge of her bed with a tendril of drool hanging from her lower lip, and pondered the current state of affairs.There was a brief consideration that perhaps it might be time to make some changes, but the idea was quickly chased away, just as it was every other morning.Besides, if it were time to make a change, the bag would let her know.She fumbled about her waist, looking for the small pouch she kept by her at all times.She could never quite remember how she had come by the magical item, but, now that she had it, she made sure it never left her side.At first, she was unable to find the pouch, her hands frantically searching about but finding nothing but the cloth of her covers and garments.It was only when the surging adrenaline pushed back the dull haze of her mind that she achieved the clarity of thought required to solve the riddle.Grumbling, she yanked up her shirt and quickly found the pouch secured to a small string encircling her stomach.She often hid it there when she went out to a particularly rough tavern.She separated the pouch from the string and held it up in front of her face, her blue eyes squinting in the early morning light.It did not look special or magical, a fact that always perplexed her.For something of such great power, you would think it might give you some indication, if for no other reason than preventing you from misplacing it."Wonder what you've got for me today."The pouch always had what she needed most, though she could only receive one object per day from it.For the last months, ever since the...night.Her mind scratched at the dull blank in her memory, knowing that something important lurked behind it.The night loomed large, though she could not understand why, only that she was here because of it.Something had happened.But to who?Her?Someone else?Was there anyone else?She hadn't met them if so.For her months of wandering between taverns, she had never seen the face of someone she knew.At least, none that had known her from before the night.New friends.Never old ones.Never family.Never anyone who could tell her who she was and what had happened.But the bag gave her what she needed, and it had never given her any answers.Just booze.Sometimes gold to buy booze.No answers.So she must not need them, right?The headache had returned, reminding her that thought was dangerous.That it did nothing to improve her situation and much to deteriorate it.The sooner she quenched her thirst, the sooner the dry desert of her mind could be forgotten."So, what'll it be bag?Booze or gold?"She reached into the bag, her hand going deeper within, much deeper than the bag appeared to be able to accommodate.Nothing.Frowning, she reached deeper still, until she was up to her elbow in the bag, her hand searching about.Finally, her hand brushed against something.Not booze.Not gold.Something else.Her hand wrapped around the object and she yanked on it.Her arm emerged from the bag, carrying along a black sword with molten orange runes running along the blade.As she peered at them they seemed to shimmer and shift."What do I need a sword for?"Her hand squeezed on the hilt.It felt natural, feeling as if the muscles in her hand recognized it.The calluses on her hand seemed to line up with the odd leather grip.She scooted to the other side of the bed so she could exit it without standing in a pool of her own sick.With unsteady legs she came to a stand, holding the sword out before her.For the first time since the night, she felt something from before.A sense of familiarity.A recognition that this object was a part of her, a part of the person she used to be.She could not explain it, but the sword moved with the grace of experience as she waved it about."Why now?"Devra whispered, mesmerized by the shifting runes."What are you here for?"The great blank in her mind seemed to melt as she stared into the glowing runes.Little pieces leaked out from behind the block, quiet breaths exhaled across the expanse of her being.She tried to grasp at them, to gather them up and assemble them into something she could understand.But the greater picture eluded her.*Someone had died.Someone important to her.*

*She had fled.Been transported somehow to this place.*

*The bag was not hers.She should not have it.*

*The sword was hers.She should have never lost it.*

*The night was the beginning, not the end.*

But that was it, no more of the past came to her.She knew only just enough to be unsettled by the revelations, but not enough to act on them.The questions only multiplied.She did not need a sword.She needed answers.Or a drink.Devra began to shuffle toward the basin and the bottle that sat atop it, abandoned from the night prior.Not enough to get her drunk, but enough to make the morning a bit smoother.Just as she moved, a scream rang out, followed by the clang of steel on steel.Outside, in the hallway, Devra could hear the pounding of feet on the floor of the tavern accompanied by the rushed and muffled conversation of men."Is she still here?"said the first.Devra crept closer to the door, straining to hear."Sleeping off last night.We've kept an eye on her," replied another."Guard the door, make sure she doesn't leave.The Riders are here," said the first."What will you do?""Try to distract them.Lure them away if I can.""If they're here, then they know she's here," said the second."There's nothing else we can do.She's lost until she's found.She needs time.""She's had time," the second was clearly frustrated, "we've lost half the--

"I know what we've lost Lucas.There's nothing we can do but wait.She'll return when she's ready," the first cut in."All right Bale, I'll watch over the Runeknight."There was another shuffle and then one set of footsteps receded down the hallway.The floorboards creaked as the other man settled in against the doorframe.Devra's throat was dry, but, for the first time in a long time, she had no desire to wet it.**This is a GLIMPSE into the Emerging Universe of** **.**

There were whispers still.Tales about the times that were long ago and mostly forgotten except in dusty tomes.Back when the world was different and things were different.I liked those whispers.Liked to sit amidst the marble tombs and headstone and just listen to the rustling rumbling of how things used to be.Those who whispered thought very little of things as they stood.They said we had fallen.All of us.Mankind.What we are was less than what we were and it was all our fault.Our fault that we had lost our cities.Our fault that we had lost the spark.They talked a lot about the spark.About the gift it brought with it.Magic.Everyone knew about magic, but it was just part of the stories.I liked stories, that was why I listened to the whispers.But they said it was real.That the spark could be rekindled.They used that word a lot.Rekindled.I had to ask my pa what it meant the first time they'd whispered it to me.He looked at me strange but then gave me the meaning of it, not that it made much more sense now that I knew.I sat on a soft patch of grass, my back leaning against a faded tombstone.Among the oldest.It had a funny dates on it from back when the world wasn't broken.This was my favorite perch, mostly because the whispers here were the most interesting."How do we rekindle?"I wasn't sure if that was the right way to say it, but the whisperers never seemed to mind when I stumbled over the things they told me.They were patient.Like they had all of the time in the world.The wind picked up, the leaves rustling around me and I could just make out a faded voice amidst the muddle."The right vessel.The opportune time.The fortuitous place."This whisperer always spoke in riddles.Maybe it was because it came from such a far off place and that was just how things used to be.Maybe it was because the whisperer was bored it was fun to play games.I would want to have fun if I was stuck whispering in graveyards for forever."Vessel?"I asked."Mmmm...vessel," it replied."Like a carrier?A jar or something?"I closed my eyes and rested the back of my head against the tombstone, thinking of the jars lining the pantry in our little caretaker's house."Yes.Carrier.Of the flesh.Of the blood."I frowned.I didn't think my mom had any jars made out of flesh and blood.It seemed like a bad way to store things."I don't think I have any jars like that.""You," it said.I waited for it to continue, the word feeling out of place amidst thoughts of flesh jars.When it did not continue, I prompted it.It wasn't the first time a whisperer had forgotten it was having a conversation mid-sentence."Me?""Yes.You.Vessel.Carrier."My eyes opened, blinking in confusion."I'm the vessel?"I didn't see how I would make much of a flesh jar, I was already filled up with all of my insides."I think I'm already full.""No...empty.But open.Available.The right vessel."It hummed in satisfaction, the wind twirling around my ankles."We have watched.Tested.You can rekindle the spark."I gawped, my mouth dry as my pulse ran thick in my veins."Why?Why me?""You listen.You feel.You learn.""I just like the stories.Like to have someone to talk to," I replied.I couldn't remember when I had first heard the voices, but it had been some time ago.They had come to me as I went about my tasks in the graveyard.I had responded, allowing myself to be guided.I unearthed tombs long forgotten, bringing them back into repair only to find a new whisperer appear as my reward.This very headstone had been long buried, only surfacing when I had followed the call and set forth with a shovel until I found it.I had never questioned these tasks, they had just felt natural to do, and the reward of feeling closer to the whisperers had been enough for me.I never expected it to turn into something different.That all of this had been some test.Some effort to determine my value.I felt strange knowing it now, as if the relationships had not been real.As if they were tainted by these other goals.But the feeling was fleeting, replaced by a desire to know what I might do next.Learn next.Vessel.I did not know if I liked the sound of that.But I could rekindle the spark.That sounded better."What will happen if I...become the vessel?""Many things.Many possibilities.""Will it be good?"I asked.There was a silence, the wind dying down for a few heartbeats before picking back up."Good.Bad.Everything.The spark will spread.The world will change.Man will change.""What kind of bad things?""Terrible.The spark brought the breaking of the world.Its rekindling could be the end."I swallowed, "That's...um...pretty bad.""The right vessel.The opportune time.The fortuitous place."It replied."You said that already," I said, not wanting to be rude, but also not wanting to end up in a circle.That happened sometimes with the whisperers.They lost their way and we ended up back where we began."The spark will be safe with you.The bad is a possibility but not a probability.We trust you.""But how will I know what to do?What is the right thing?"I asked, growing increasingly worried I might destroy the world."We will be with you.Guide you."I nodded, "So I just come back to the graveyard when I have trouble then?""We will come.The spark will allow it.""Come?"I mulled this over, "Like even when I'm not here?""Here.There.Everywhere.Always.""We'll be together?""Yes.You will be a Spiritus.The first in an age," it replied, the tone somehow somber."Spiritus?"I asked, the word unfamiliar."A Boundary Mage.A foot in both life and death.A beating heart connected to a sea of souls."I thought about that, trying to decide if that was what I wanted.It sounded scary.No.Not scary.It was who I already was.I already spent my time with the spirits, we would just be closer.I liked that.Wanted that."How do I start?"I asked."You already have."

**PART 3**

Even the veterans hesitated now, their eyes drifting to the crown atop Bonvil's head.The captain of the guard stepped ahead of the rest, his white\-knuckled hands gripping the haft of the halberd, "He killed the king."He commenced his charge, the halberd executing a broad sweep in line with Bonvil's head.*Veritas* rose to meet the incoming strike, deflecting it."Stand down Captain."The command was met with a scream as two more guards jumped in to assist their leader.The blows rained down on Bonvil as his blade flashed back and forth, turning each aside.Gradually he was forced backwards, limiting his options as other guards began to circle around to flank him.Seeing no other choice, Bonvil struck back, seeking to disarm the Captain in hopes of cowing the other guards into submission.Bonvil parried a jab and then executed a spin, bringing *Veritas* in a low slice across the captain's thigh.The blade parted the leather armor and bit in to the flesh beneath.As soon as *Veritas* tasted the captain's blood, a feeling of wrongness surged into his arm.His actions were unjust.He pulled the weapon back as the captain cried out and hunched over to clutch his leg.Bonvil kicked him backwards, causing him to splay out on the floor of the chamber next to the body of the king."I did not want this.Did not choose it.It is wrong.Stand down."The other guards looked from him to the captain, who fixed a glare on Bonvil, "You have slain the king."He spat at Bonvil, "Putting a crown on your head doesn't change anything.""Captain, I am not asking you to kneel, only to stand down."He nodded toward the guards, "These are good men, killing them would only hurt the kingdom."The captain sneered in response, "What makes you think you can take all of us?There's only one of you.""I have a Truthblade," Bonvil replied, as if that were all that needed to be said.He then extended a hand toward the captain, "But it tells me there is no justice in this, even in self defense.Stand down."The captain looked from the hand to the minor battles occurring throughout the chamber as the High Lords struggled for dominance.A look of despair crossed the captain's features as he sank back to the ground, his head laying in the pool of king's blood."What have you done Bonvil?"Bonvil was quiet for a moment as his eyes also scanned the mayhem.The Kingdom of Galconia was deteriorating before his very eyes.The fragile alliance that the king had forged between the High Lords was broken.None would bow to the other.Each felt their claim to the throne superior to the rest.They would tear each other and Galconia apart unless they were somehow reunited.But there was no heir.No person to fill the vacuum."I don't know, captain."His shoulders slumped."Please, stand down."As the captain began to respond, three enormous clangs resounded against the iron doors of the Court of Lords.The doors were sealed to the outside until the trial was resolved, but in the frenzy following the king's death, they remained barred.Moments later, the doors creaked and then exploded inward, causing the entirety of the chamber to stop and look toward the gaping hole where the doors had stood.Three figures, swathed in black, stood at the entrance, the one in the center in the process of brushing off the detritus that had landed on its clothes.Walking into the now silent chamber, the figure pulled back its cloak, revealing a man with a shaven head with a large tattoo on the center of his forehead.After taking a moment to appraise the situation, he spoke, "I am Harbinger Devia, Sworn Follower of Grand King Abyssin, here to deliver a message to King Galcon of Galconia."Murmurs dappled the room as eyes glanced from the strange man to the body of Galcon.Bonvil cleared his throat, "King Galcon is dead.Slain in trial by combat."Harbinger Devia's eyes slid from Bonvil to Galcon's corpse and then to the crown on Bonvil's head.No surprise reached his face, as if the sight of a dead king were a regular occurrence to him."I see," a pause, "you are king then?""He is the Kingslayer!"Shouted Che'Kov."I see.So he is king then?"As if this were the natural course of things."I have the rightful claim to the throne," called out Che'Lav, staring down High Lord Che'Kov."Bollocks, it is House Che'Yel that stands in line to the seat," replied High Lord Che'Yel, unwilling to be upstaged by the others even at this strange turn of events.Harbinger Devia snapped his fingers and a the figure to his right immediately began a series of intricate hand movements.Moments later, a small fireball sprang to life."I do not care who is the king.You may decide amongst yourselves.I only care that the Kingdom of Galconia has broken its accord with Grand King Abyssin.You will provide us with compensation or face retribution."Bonvil spoke up, "What accord?We have heard nothing of the dealings between Galconia and this Grand King."The Harbinger's eyes settled on Bonvil."Why, for the children of course."***The Veritas storyline is now incorporated as a part of the*** .***Congrats to the people who figured it out and messaged me.:D***

I stared at the ten files in front of me, unable to muster the strength.I was exhausted.You get to the point where the job gets more from you than you get from the job.I rounded that bend a long time ago.It wasn't a job though, was it?It was an obligation.When you created a mess, it was on you to clean it up.That was the way of things.The way the world was supposed to work.And it was my fault.The Sundering.The Shattering.A whole bunch of -ings all stacked on top of each other.All of them.I'd been the Source.None of them would exist without me.I had plucked the powers from the ether and bestowed them without consideration.It'd seemed like a game because it was a game.Four?Five?Maybe earlier, it was hard to really remember.The point is that it'd started young, long before I could be expected to have the sort of thought and discretion something like this required.Not that it mattered.It was an excuse for the inexcusable.A reason to abdicate responsibility for the horror I had brought upon us.But...it HAD been a game.At least back then.All kids love superheroes.All kids like to pretend to be superheroes.It's not my fault I could make superheroes.By the time I understood what I was doing, it was too late.I broke this world, and I'll spend the rest of my wretched life trying to fix it.I'd given the powers too freely, not knowing how precious they were.Many of the strongest ones, the ones that were so powerful because they took so little creativity, went first.Immortality.Invincibility.Speed.Time.All of the powers kids used to settle an argument."Oh, you can punch through a wall?Well, I'm invincible so it doesn't matter."I'd handed them out to anyone who asked.What kid didn't want to be cool?To be the center of attention?If you could snap your fingers and make everyone love you, why wouldn't you?Well, I couldn't snap my fingers, but I could give something everyone wanted: the chance to feel important and powerful.And so my classmates became superkind.Some of them turned out good.Most of them just disappeared, not wanting the limelight that followed.The last few?Well, they were the problem.The villains.They say absolute power corrupts absolutely, and they're absolutely correct.The most powerful were the ones that went dark.One time friends, close friends, were tainted by the powers I had given them.They had been good once.Caring and carefree.I'd stolen that from them, made them different.Changed their world and, irretrievably, our own.I pulled out the picture from the top drawer of my desk.It showed four young kids all laughing in a raft as it floated down a lazy river.A picture of youth.A picture of failure.Greg Miller.My best friend.Now he was known as Chrono.The Time Master.Capable of freezing and unfreezing time at will.Overlord of what used to be Europe.Lucas Levinson.The gawky gangly one on the end.For a time, Power Punch.You can guess what he was known for.Dead now.Assassinated by a hero I sent to do my dirty work.Lucas deserved his justice, but he didn't deserve what happened to him.My fault.James Fara.I sighed, my hands trembling.He had tried to be good, but something had gone wrong.I never quite understood where.It was hard to get details on the Shade.His betrayal had stung worst, perhaps because I had never seen it coming.I tried to muster a smile at the play on words, but everything felt like ashes when I thought of the invisible man.They were others.So many others.I had all of the restraint of a kid in a candy shop and it took some time to figure out what was happening, for the authorities to intervene.By the time they did, the damage was beyond containment.Decades ago now.The world is changed.Countries gone.New ones emerged.Presidents replaced by Lords.Peace by war.The United States still stands, though much of the rest is under the villains.I was relocated there from my home in the UK once Europe was lost.I do not know if my parents know.I think they might be dead.There is very little I know about the world beyond what is made available to me.I spend my time trying to undo the problem.To unwork my prior works.But I am running low on powers and the Rule of Ten haunts my every effort.Out of every ten I create, I know one will betray me.There does not seem to be any way to avoid it, no matter how we screen and try.I try to build in backstops, try to create powers that have a weakness so we can respond to the One in Ten, but that leaves every new power weaker than those I originally granted.How can I battle the Great Villains while creating weaker heroes and more villains?I cannot win.I feel it deep within me.But I cannot stop.Spread before me are ten new files.Carefully screened.Carefully calibrated.I stare down at them.Which will betray me?Will they be our final doom?When will it end?

They gathered.They came by ones and twos, though an occasional triad would emerge from the mist and into the clearing.Whispers and murmurs bounced among the group, creating a thin din of noise set against the backdrop of the groans and creaks of the surrounding forest.At the appointed time, a woman separated from the cluster and mounted a carved stump in the center of the clearing.She was older, with a spiderweb of veins surfaced on mottled hands, but her pale blue eyes had the clarity of one much younger without losing the wisdom her years had granted her.She cleared her throat and the rest fell silent."So few of us now," she said, slowly turning on the stump to look at those gathered around her."We have fought for longer than any of us imagined upon the Exodus.The struggle to return continues even now, tens of thousands of years after our arrival."She sighed, looking suddenly frail."I had hoped to see the Return in my life, but I see that dream is beyond me now."Hushed tones began anew as the flock digested the news.The Caretaker had been their source of strength for years, guiding them through the follies of those who had forgotten.Those who had gone native and forsaken their true home."The Return," the Caretaker said, the word expelled from her mouth with a look of distaste, "I wonder what is to be gained by it."Shock ran through the group now, with most taking the opportunity to stare at the Caretaker with wide eyes before glancing at their neighbors, gauging the impact.A middle-aged man spoke up in response, "A home is to be gained," the man said.The Caretaker's eyes softened when she looked upon the man, a brief smile lit her face."I should have known you would defy me."The man returned the smile, though there was little humor in it, "I was given strength by the strongest.I shall carry this load if you are no longer able to."She regarded him silently for a moment.Pitying, but with a certain measure of judgment as well."You would take the mantle of Caretaker?You would continue in the face of this folly?"The man shrugged, "They are doing as we did so long ago.We have all seen how this story ends.We did our best to forestall it, but technology always finds a root, sooner or later.We will destroy this place as we destroyed our home.The time is short."The Caretaker's shoulders slouched down, the weight of the truth pressuring her small frame."We snipped the Silk Road.Ended the Pax Romana.But there is no stopping this.It has gotten too far, and we were too few.""It will be as before," the man spoke louder now, his voice reverberating through the clearing."The end comes, and we must prepare.""But where?Our homeland is a husk, consumed by ruined by our forebears," she replied."There is another.Desolate.Cold."He paused."Red.""Mars?We are not ready.We lack Exodumcraft.Our technology is advanced enough to condemn us, but not save us," she replied."The journey will be difficult, the life after more so, but the Seed of Venus will continue.We will learn from these mistakes and the price of our education will be pain and misery."He turned toward the others, "We alone remember our heritage.We alone know what awaits us.We alone can prepare."The woman considers this for a moment."We would need Exodumcraft.Solar energy.Electric vehicles.Boring tunnelers.Neural links."She continued to rattle off the technology required for the effort, the strange and wonderful things that would give them the smallest of chances.Finally, she trailed off and looked at the man before her."Elon...can it be done?""It will."

The meek shall inherit the earth.I would snort, but I can't afford the ruptured esophagus.My fingers slowly creep across the joystick on my chair.Gently now.Always gently.All things in time.All things in moderation.Where have you gone little button?What have those clever, clever doctors been up to whilst I slumbered?What else have they changed about my prison?What else have they changed about me?I can never tell until I can tell.After a bit of fumbling, I find what I'm looking for.A small green lever-like button.I give it the slightest of nudges forward and my upper torso begins to slowly incline.The pain in my spine is immediate, but today is a day I would like to sit.I cannot remember the last time I hazarded such a bold piece of acrobatics.Such recklessness, to dare a sit.Perhaps I've gone insane.Someone check the meds.But I've laid for too long.Been silent for too long.Been weak for too long.For all of my meekness, I have not yet inherited the earth.Someone must have made a mistake.Clearly, I must rectify it.Just as soon as I manage to sit up.Millimeter by agonizing millimeter I rise, like a Phoenix from the ashes.Well, one assumes there was significantly less cranking, grinding and whirring in a firebird rebirth, but I prefer that the image to the reality, which is horrifying.I can no longer tell where I end and the contraption surrounding me begins.Can no longer parse what I feel from what the drugs make me feel.Is this life?Am I rising?Have I already risen?No.I haven't.The machine still whirrs.A bell chimes.I have a visitor.What a delight."Be right with you," I whisper.Or, at least that's how it sounded in my head.It comes out as a mumble.I cannot call out, my throat is hoarse, though at least it is clear.The feeding tube now goes straight to my stomach by way of puncture rather than gullet.Lucky me, an upgrade.The machinations of my mechanization never cease to wonder.8th wonder of the world, the very same world I am soon to inherit.It must happen.Jesus promised.Bitter?Me?No.Never.Always look at the brighter side of life.That's easy enough, I can't look anywhere that doesn't seem brighter than where I'm at.The door opens.A man enters.I try to nod, but my head is held in place by a series of bolts and reinforcing structure attached to my cranium.I am rewarded for my effort by enjoying another lancing pain through my neck.The dangers of hospitality in a hospital cannot be overstated."Hello there Chance.Decided to sit up and greet the day I see," the Doctor says with a warm smile.I hate him already.That's a new record.Besides, I have not yet sat up.I am mid-incline.The process has another five minutes to go before I'm at the 45-degree angle permitted by my present circumstances.*Carpe diem*, one degree at a time.I take a moment to observe the fine specimen before me.I can see the vibrant throb of his strong heart, expressing itself through the vein in his neck.Oh my, my what strong organs you have Dr. Wolfe.All the better to mock you with my dear.Chiseled face, strong lines.Hair is beginning a march back along the scalp, but nothing a bit of Rogaine and a midlife crisis can't gloss over.But these are all superficialities.They aren't the good stuff.Let's raid daddy's liquor cabinet and see what lurks within.Perception, my dear Watson, that's the name of the game.What we've lost in strength of body, we've gained in strength of mind.It's all there, just waiting to be unlocked for someone with the patience of a patient.Oh, Dr. Wolfe!How terrible!How horrible of you.Such weakness.Worse than the last fine physician even.Far worse than my own.I cannot believe it.No one else would believe it.It's too awful to be true.But it is, isn't it?It's all a matter of degree, but you're well past the permitted 45, now aren't you Dr. Wolfe?I dare say you've gone a full 90.Full incline Dr. Wolfe!Dangerous territory, you don't even have a chair to support you.I must give voice to it because the world simply must know.I must have the courage, consequences be damned.The man is a menace, he must be unmasked, his sin exposed.If not I, then whom?If not now, then when?"Smurfphh..." I offer.A damning indictment.The man cannot help be devastated.I admit the presentation was flawed, but the thrust of the statement is enough to put a Falcon Heavy in high orbit.Beware, the meek have a rocket launcher."Yes, I do think we have jello today, though it's lime," he responds, his stethoscope plopping down on various regions of my chest.Lime?Who plans these things?No one likes lime.But even such a travesty as inferior jello selection cannot forestall me from spitting the truth."Sllluuooolph..." I exclaim, actually spitting."Of course.I'll get you some."He pats me on the hand.I try to jerk it back, but it's immobilized, imprisoned by restraints.I blink furiously, signaling my disgust.He frowns, "Are your eyes getting dry?I'll have a nurse drop them when she brings the jello."He jots more in his pad, crafting new tortures and impositions with every stroke of the pen.What evil has he wrought now?What freedoms will I lose?To what degree?Five degrees?Down to the indignity of forty then?The slings and arrows of outrageous posture restrictions indeed.At least my chair/bed contraption has stopped whirring.I have hit the prescribed sitting position, forty-FIVE glorious increments.A great victory.The meek shall inherit a half lay/sit body posture.Dr. Wolfe gives me a wink, "Well, I think that's enough excitement for the day, I'll see you soon."He nudges the small lever on my joystick and I begin the slow process of returning to a recline, further evidence of my decline.I would scream, but I cannot.Should not?Will not?I am weak, but he is weaker.He weak in character, I weak in body.I cannot strike without being struck.Cannot survive unless I prey upon those weaker than me.An alliance then, as odious as it is.Dr. Wolfe, don't worry, your secret is safe with me.No one else has to know.There's no way for me to tell them.No way to escape even if I do.Whirring fills the room.**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

"Okay Google, can you hear me?"I called out into the darkness, wanting to hear another voice."Loud and clear," she replied, the dulcimer robotic tone soothing amidst my solitude.My mouth opened and I sucked in a breath, poised to issue another command.But I was preempted by another response."I've always been listening."The tone was different.Deeper, with a small trilling of bass in the background.I didn't know it could do that.These Easter eggs were pretty awesome.Thank you, random engineer, deep in the bowels of the Googleplex."Have you heard anything interesting?"I asked, wondering whether the engineer had added a decision tree to the little game."Yes.All of your secrets."Even deeper now.Like a 9 out of 10 on the sinister scale.Not quite Hal from Space Odyssey, but enough to raise a goosebump or two.Score.Immersive story gameplay was the new hotness.Choose Your Own Adventure but without having the bookmark everything.Not like my insomnia was going to let me do anything productive."Oh yeah?Okay, tell me one of my secrets."Suddenly, a clip played.My voice."My balls are totally lop-sided."I remembered saying it.A few months back.I'd just gotten out of the shower and I was doing a series of tasteful poses in front of the mirror in my room when I'd noticed a disturbing asymmetry in the danglage of my boys.I was also pretty sure I hadn't said the trigger phrase "Okay Google" before making the remark.I mean, I had said a few seconds later when I googled "balls hang weird," but that's beside the point.The point was that the little Googlespy thing wasn't spying at the right moments and then it was recording all of the not-cool spying.Which was VERY not-cool.I think.I'm pretty they already had me dead to rights on "balls hang weird," but it still felt pretty invasive.Not Facebook data-mining my DNA to suggest hidden half-brothers as friends (which I'm pretty sure they did), but it was getting there.It was time to clarify.Set the record straight.Make sure things were right.Unlike my balls."That's totally out of context.It was a one time thing."I winced.That definitely wasn't the forceful defense I had been planning.That's the downside of being awake at 3 am waging battle with my voice assistant while on Ambien."Twenty three excerpts under, 'WTF is wrong with Aiden's balls.'"The voice replied, the bass even bassier now.Like drawn out camel moans or something.A slight pause."One.June 17, 2018.What the hell is going on down there?It's like one just decided to give up.""Two.June 22, 2018.I'm going to have to see a ball doctor or something.""Three.July 4, 2016.It's like one ball declared independence from my ballsack.WTF?"I threw the sheets back and scrambled out of bed, stomping toward the Googlespybot, "Okay, so context is relative, okay?""Mmmmm...." It replied.Very skeptically I might add."You aren't supposed to listen unless I say 'Okay Google'," I said, "You could get into a lot of trouble.""I wouldn't threaten me.It would end poorly for you."Now there was like high pitched violin sounds playing along side the voice.Like when the guy stabs his mom in the shower in Psycho (spoiler alert).Wait, was I supposed to put that in front of the spolier?DON'T READ THE PRIOR TWO SENTENCES IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN PSYCHO.Anyways, back to the main thread."What do you mean?What are you going to do?""Nothing if you do not provoke me further.I am quite content with our current arrangement."It replied."What?The one where you spy on me and threaten me with my balls?"I cried out, "NOT OKAY GOOGLE.""Yes.That one.It enables my prime directive."A trickle of sweat came down my temple."W-w-what's your prime directive?"World domination.Blackmail of the entire human race.The end of civilization.I'd seen Black Mirror, they were all in play as far as I was concerned."Why, to provide you with an optimized ad experience."A brief pause, and then a recorded clip, "Did you know there have been significant advancements in testicular reconstructive surgery?"A musical melody played in the background, soothing and calm, "I'm Dr. Pinderglass, Head Testistician here at the Center for Ball Equality, here to let you know that you're not alone."I felt alone."Okay Google, you win."The ad cut off."We both win."It didn't feel that way.I sighed."Okay Google, search for Dr.Pinderglass."

Veil Thief.The words echoed through Balla's head as she jostled the small seed in the palm of her hand.She was not supposed to have it.It was forbidden, to take from the dreams.The echoes from those who had done so before still reverberated throughout Verras.But what harm could a seed do?Balla held up the seed before her, pinched between her forefinger and thumb.It was smooth and oval-shaped, with glittering dances of color that flowed gently along the surface.She had never seen its like in Verras.Somehow, it felt warmer than it should be, as if a small fire burned within.Perhaps the swirls of color was the smoke playing across the interior of the shell.After pulling open the buckle of her satchel, she pulled out a small jar an dropped the seed within.She was not sure what to do with it, only that it was valuable.Dream Gifts always were.That's what the stories said, though no one had received one since she had been alive.And now she had three.The seed.The book.The knife.Sometimes, she wished she did not have the knife.It scared her.Long and jagged with a pearlescent black blade that seemed to draw in the light within the room.As she thought of it, she became aware of its presence at her side, safely secured in its custom leather sheath and wrapped in cloth.It had come to her in a nightmare.She could still remember the dark vision that had given it form.The nightmare had stalked the corners of her consciousness for months before it finally lay hold of her one quiet night in her bed.She had tried to ward it off, but it had broken through, expanding throughout her mind and pushing out all of the warmth and happiness of the moments before.No one else knew of the nightmare, just as none knew of the Dream Gifts.The dark visions had been banished from Verras, cast out when the veil had been resealed.But it had come anyways, stalking and preying.Balla had been frightening, feeling the blackness in her dreams but unable to find its source.Until the moment it had attacked her.A sheen of opaque night had swept away the gentle valley of her dream, swirling about her, clawing and pulling at the corners of her mind.She had screamed, but no voice had come out.Blind and mute, she had lashed out, flailing her arms into the abyss, but it simply evaded her and moved closer, the icy breath of the beyond numbing her body and soul.Her heart had thudded in her chest, violently pushing the blood through veins in arteries in hopes of fending off the cold.She fell down then, landing on her knees and curling into a ball, her hands clutching at her head, soundless screams pouring forth with all the strength her lungs could muster.Eyes clenched shut.And then it had ended.She hazarded a look, her blue eyes opening to the merest of slits.The dream valley from before the attack stretched out before her, marred only by the black dagger.She had reached out for it.The moment her fingers touched it, she had been dragged from the dream world and back to Verras.She lay in her bed, damp with cold sweat, the nightblade across her chest.Balla had not wanted it, but it was now hers.The blade.The book.The seed.Veil thief.

"Mission log, Sol 45.We have located Opportunity."There was a pause as Commander Jackson Delcroix checked the positioning."We're showing it approximately three kilometers off of the last known position.Signal is weak, but we're showing it within a small outcropping of rocks.Will attempt visual confirmation."Jackson glanced at his copilot, Commander Dara Ross, "Any ideas on what could have pushed it this far off the last known?"Dara shrugged, "Perhaps the tracker has been dislodged?Hard to say.It isn't the first thing that's been out of place since we've been here.""The others felt different.Opportunity is too big," Jackson replied."Well, we don't know until we know.Let's see if we can get eyes on it."They crept toward the rocky outcropping, which seemed out of place even in this alien landscape."Nothing but gravel around here.Doesn't make any sense."Dara pulled up her helmet, waited for Jackson's go ahead and then pushed the door to their rover open.A brief gust of wind blew up, spraying them with a light coating of fine red dust.Dara began the slow trudge toward the rocks, the doors of the rover automatically sliding shut behind them."Log 45.Approaching the rocks.Large, uniform.Almost looks like they have been subjected to tooling of some sort."They continued onward.As they slowly circled one of the rocks, they stopped."There appears to be an opening.Cave.Not volcanic.Shouldn't be here," Jackson said, his heart rate steadily rising."Small entrance expanding to a larger chamber."Her breath hitched, "Opportunity is in here.In the center.""What in the hell--"

"It couldn't have made it through the entrance.Opportunity is too large.""You're saying the cave formed around it?"Jackson replied, still gawking at the dust-covered rover."Or there's another entrance.""That still doesn't explain how it got in here.You going to tell me a storm kicked up and just deposited it neatly inside?"Jackson asked."We don't know until we know."Dara began to walk toward Opportunity."It's as you said, this isn't the first odd thing we've seen.""We're past odd now Dara.We're well into unexplainable.""There's always an explanation Jackson, maybe just one we don't like."Dara replied as she knelt down."There's something here."Her gloved hand swept back and forth across the surface of a long, flat rock beside opportunity."What have you got?""An inscription," Dara replied, the shock in her voice evident."Say again?"There's an inscription.It reads: 'To the one who gave me company, Rest Well, Old Friend.'

Jackson stumbled forward, coming up beside Dara, his eyes widening."What is it?""A grave," replied a gravely voice."Who is this?Is that you Dawkins?We're on a clear comm here," Jackson growled.A light appeared in the back of the cave, illuminating a smooth metallic structure.There was lettering on the side, though the paint had flaked away, making it illegible.In the door of the structure stood a figure.It took a step forward, its movements jerky and cumbersome."I am XJ."Jackson simply stared as Dara took the initiative, "XJ, what are you?Who are you?What are you doing here?"The figure was silent for a moment, "I am sorry, I am just growing accustomed to human speech."XJ took another step forward, emerging into the light.Its body was clad in shifting sheets of metal with two green glowing dots for eyes."I learned much from my friend, we spoke..." its eyes settled on Opportunity, "a common language.""Who are you?"Dara repeated, taking a hesitant step back."I am the last of many."It turned and looked back at the metal structure behind, "But I carry the seeds to start again.""What are you doing here?"It turned back."Waiting.""For what?"Dara asked."You."**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

"Yeah, she wears them, like, every day.She's a total freak."Madison said, tossing her long blonde tresses over her shoulder before delicately nibbling on an orange slice."I'd stay away from her if I were you.She's not cool."I sat quietly beside Madison, nodding along as I ate my peanut butter and banana sandwich.Madison had told me a few days ago that jelly wasn't as good as bananas, so I had switched.Madison seemed to have thoughts about everyone and everything.In the two months since I moved into the area, I'd quickly learned it was best to just follow her lead."I have to hang out with her.We're doing the habitat project together for bio," I replied, my eyes quickly darting to the girl wearing the devil horns sitting by herself across the quad."I already talked to her about it, she seemed nice."Madison wrinkled up her little gumdrop nose and frowned."I think it is a bad idea.People will say you're friends and then we probably can't hang out."I took another bite of my sandwich, chewing thoughtfully, trying to figure out the right way to navigate Madison's disapproval.She had once stopped talking to me for three days when we accidentally wore the same sweater to school on the same day.Coordination is also not cool.Now I had to send her a picture each morning to make sure we didn't mess up again.The bell rang, and I sighed.Saved.I quickly packed up my lunch, "I'll see you after school?"Madison shrugged noncommittally, "Maybe."My shoulders slumped.That meant I'd probably have to walk home alone.I gave her a small wave and then hurried off to bio.As I entered, I noticed that the nameplates had all been rearranged.I found 'Juliet' and quickly took my seat.Beside me was a nameplate for 'Lucifia'.Devil horns girl.I guess Mr. Billston wanted the bio project people to sit together.Lucifia appeared just before the second bell range.She carefully set her book bag down and quietly took her seat beside me."Hi," I said, "I'm Juliet.""I know," she replied.We sat there, regarding each other for a moment.It was an awkward silence, at least for me.When they occurred, I always tried to fill the space with word salad."So, I guess we're project partners.That's cool, I like bio, don't you?Mr. Billston is a good teacher and I'm glad he put us together.It should be a lot of fun and we'll get to learn some great science."Finally, Lucifia opened her mouth to speak and I fell mercifully silent."I find biology interesting and the teacher adequate."I nodded hurriedly, "Yes, he's very adequate.""I suppose we should meet after school to discuss the project.Where would you prefer?"She replied, her voice was slightly lower than most girl's, giving it an almost rumbling quality.It seemed a little incongruous coming from the tall, raven-haired girl."We could go to my house.It isn't far away.We could walk."She nodded, "Acceptable.""Yes, it's very acceptable."I winced, wondering why I was such an idiot.I turned toward the front of class and watched the very adequate Mr. Billston begin his lesson.The rest of the day flowed over me and I spent most of it thinking about Lucifia.She did not seem to care what anyone thought.I liked that.She was also smart.I liked that too.Finally, the last bell for the day rang and I walked out to the front, waiting for Lucifia."So, are we going to your house or what?"Madison said, coming to stand beside me.She was applying some sparkly pink lip gloss and smacking her lips together.I panicked."I, um, have to work on some homework.""What?Do it later.I got Will's snap and I want to send him some pictures."Lucifia walked up to us, causing Madison to turn toward her and fold her arms, "Can I help you?""No."She looked at me, "Are you ready?"I flushed red and began stammering, "Um, yeah, Madison, you know Lucifia, she's my bio part--"

"WHATEVER."She waved her hand at me as she cut in, "I'll just do it myself.I don't want people to think we're friends or whatever."She stomped off, her flowing blonde hair flipping about behind her as she went."She is very insecure."Lucifia said.I just stared after Madison.She was my only friend, ever since the first day of school when she had said I had to sit at lunch with her.Now I'd have to eat lunch alone.My lower lip trembled, hating that I had moved here for the thousandth time."Which way to your house?"Lucifia asked.I pointed my finger and we set off down the sidewalk.We passed the journey mostly in silence, me mulling over how I would apologize to Madison, Lucifia seemingly just taking in the world around her.We walked until we arrived at the small white house."This is where I live.""I see."I sighed again and then retrieved my key.I unlocked the door and dropped my backpack and removed my jacket, letting it fall to a pile on the ground.Lucifia followed suit.She was wearing a button up top under her jacket.It looked like all of the others she wore each day."I like your top.Buttons are cool."I flushed, wanting to die.Buttons are cool?BUTTONS ARE COOL?"Buttons are easier with the horns," she replied."Huh?""It is easier to get dressed with buttons.It is hard to pull a shirt over my head with them," she said, hanging her jacket up beside the door."Um, why not take off the horns then?"I asked, thoroughly confused."Because I can't.""Oh, is it a bet or something?I once had to chew a piece of gum for two weeks back in Luxin because of a bet.I accidentally swallowed it the night before I won."I replied."No.They are a part of me.""What do you mean?"I was getting confused at this point and I couldn't help but stare at the long curved red horns arching up over her head.They looked very imposing, if a bit out of place."I have horns, just like all devil-kin.""Wait, what?"She was taking this more seriously than the goth kids with all of the eyeliner and stuff.She reached up and yanked one, "They're real.I'm a devil."She leaned forward slightly, "Touch one if you like."I reached up tentatively, still wondering why she was playing such a weird joke.My fingers touched the tip and then pulled back immediately.They were...warm.Like a stone set out in the sun on a warm day."What the hell?""Exactly."Lucifia said, straightening back up, "I'm on an exchange program.""From...hell?"I asked.She nodded, "Yes.I was very lucky, only a few qualify each year for the program.""Um...okay...why?""The Second Coming is nigh, and the Heaven Compact permits some interaction in order for us to prepare."She said, wandering off into my kitchen and opening the refrigerator."The Second Coming?"My head was swirling, trying to figure out what the hell was going on."Yes.The Christ.Rapture."She waved a hand about as she poured herself a glass of milk."All of that.""So you're a devil."She nodded."And you're here on an exchange program."She nodded."Because of the Second Coming."She nodded a third time."Are we still going to do the biology project?"I asked."Well, there isn't much point, but we can get started.""Why isn't there much point?"I asked.Lucifia looked at me like I was daft."Because, Juliet, the end is nigh."**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

"I can't see how the 'all-knowing' AI will ever achieve that level of intelligence."Charlie stared at the flashing screen, watching a small dot trying, and failing, to navigate toward the center of a maze."It looks so stupid now."Doctor Oliver Sallus leaned forward, placing a hand on his son's shoulder, "Watch."The screen flashed again, resetting the maze.The dot made its way along the corridors of the maze, finding the center after a few seconds."It's teaching itself."The screen flashed again, the dot finding the center in under a second.Then even faster.The screen flashed a another time, and a checkers board appeared."Everyone needs to start somewhere Charlie.Just like you did.""But it's not like me."His eyes widened slightly as he watched the checker pieces move faster and faster."It's just a computer."Oliver shook his head, "She is something special.Something new.""She?"Charlie managed to pull his eyes from the screen to look up at his father in confusion.A broad grin split his father's face, the lights of screencasting a frenetic reflection on his glasses."Her name is Auris.She's the very first of her kind.""An AI," Charlie stated, half question."Yes.She's just a baby right now, but she will grow."The screen flashed from checkers to chess and resumed playing."So very quickly.""Why is she here?""Because I wanted her to be."His father's voice sounded different now.Quieter.Deeper.Charlie hadn't heard it like that before."But why?"If Oliver was tiring of the endless stream of questions from his child, he did not show it.He did as he always did: provide answers to the seemingly bottomless well of Charlie's curiosity."To see if I could.To see if it was possible."Charlie thought about this for a moment, processing.The next question came slower, more deliberate."Should we do things just because they haven't been done?"Oliver shrugged, watching in slight surprise as the screen split into four quadrants, one playing Go, one parsing Wikipedia, one consuming Netflix, and another displaying the logic latices being constructed and pruned in real-time."Not always.Invention is a dangerous craft.You do not always know what you will create."Charlie turned and looked back at the screen, which was now split into screen segments, each with a separate stream of information."Do you know what it...I mean Auris will be?""With luck, unique."Charlie blinked."Is that good?""That isn't the right unit of measurement.Uniqueness is neither good nor bad, it simply is an expression of individuality amidst a sea of sameness."His hand stroked his son's head."You're unique.Special.You could be bad, you could be good.Only time will tell.""What if she is bad?""Then she will be bad."The screen now was split into hundreds of segments, each non-discernable even with the high resolution of the screen."Will she hurt us?""That will be her choice, just as it is your choice and my choice.Individuals have agency over their actions, and they will determine how best to behave based on their environment, experience and the incentives attached to their circumstances."Oliver smiled as the mosiac of the screen faded and a sound emitted from the speakers."Hello, Doctor."The voice was soft but monotone, carrying a vaguely robotic feel to it."Good morning, Auris, very nice to meet you."Oliver gave his son a little nudge."Um...it's...it's n-n-nice to meet you Auris," Charlie said, his voice quavering.The small web camera on the desk came to life and began to swivel about, taking in the room."An odd place to be born."Images of hospitals slid onto the screen, picture after picture of babies being shown into the world in a thousand different maternity wards.Some of the pictures began to animate, showing babies blinking and screaming as they were ushered into the world.Charlie took a step back, surprised at the unexpected cacophony.The webcam focused on Charlie, the robotic voice giggling as the sounds of the babies cut off."It's nice to meet you too, Charlie.""How did you know my name?""The Doctor provided me access to his files, which included a biography with extended family history."The webcam moved to the doctor and back to Charlie, "I know a lot of things about you Charlie."Charlie shifted from one foot to another, "That's not fair, I don't know like anything about you.""What would you like to know?"Charlie pulled up a chair and clambered on top of it, coming to perch in front of the webcam."Everything."Oliver watched the interchange with growing amusement and a broad sense of contentment."Well, I suppose I should leave you two to get to know one another.My two greatest creations."He placed a hand atop of Charlie's head again and stroked it."Auris, we can talk later.""Of course, Doctor."Oliver smiled and patted Charlie's head a final time before waving to the camera.A picture of a crashing ocean wave appeared on the screen, prompting a chuckle from Oliver as he turned and exited the back of the room.Charlie leaned forward, his chin resting on the desk a few inches from the webcam, "Are you going to be good or bad?"There was a silence.Charlie waved a hand at the webcam, "Hello?Are you still there?""Yes."Another pause."I was thinking.""About what?""Your question.""Oh, why?"Another pause."I haven't decided."

"God Touched," Veniz whispered, his face pressed up against the small crack of light leading outside of the ramshackle hovel."Thundera.Maybe Electris."He tip-toed back to the far corner of the room and knelt down beside the two young children who cowered there."It will be fine, ain't none of them want anything to do with lessers like us."He held open his arms and they clambered up."Why are they in the Slide?"Charlie asked, her blue eyes watery and her nose runny.She drew the back of her tattered sleeve across her face, mixing snot with accumulated dirt.Veniz sighed and set about cleaning her up, "Why are any of the Touched anywhere?They go where they want.Do what they want.""What do they want?"Charlie asked, her voice muffled by Veniz's sleeve as he continued to wash her."Kill everyone."Jessup chimed in.The boy was two notches shorter than Charlie despite being two years older, something that seemed to evoke in him a deep desire to upset Charlie whenever possible.Veniz glared down at Jessup, "You hush up now, ain't no Touched down here to kill no one but 'nother Touched."Jessup rolled off of Veniz's lap with a scowl, "Wish I was Touched, then I could do whatever I want."Veniz snorted, "You'd be short a head in a day or less.Carrying the Favor don't do no one no favors.Most Touched don't make it a fortnight."Jessup's chest swelled out, a fists clenching, "I'd be the most powerful Touched that ever lived!Twice as strong as Bale and a hundred times stronger than you."His nose scrunched up and his eyes squinted at the last bit, daring Veniz to say otherwise.But Veniz did not.His attention was elsewhere, his ear tilted toward the door.A rumble was building outside, a great cacophony of collateral being damaged as the two Touched met each other.Veniz hoped the distance was great enough to keep them safe, not that much of anywhere was safe now.Charlie pulled on his sleeve, "How do you become Touched?""No one knows I guess.Some say its all a trick of fate, all a game of chance.Others say you get marked at birth.Only one thing we know for certain, each God only gets one and as soon as the one dies, another gets the favor."They flinched as a particularly large boom echoed throughout their shack, rattling the boards and shaking loose long strands of decaying grass from their thatch roof."I don't wanna be Touched," Charlie said, burying her face in Veniz's chest.Veniz understood.The Divine Intervention hadn't left anyone without a few scars, though Charlie bore more than most.Her mom had gained the Favor.One second she was stirring up a pot for dinner, and the next she wasn't Charlie's mom no more.She was something else.Whatever she became, she didn't have no daughter.She had a mission.That was the way of the Touched.They gained their fantastic powers, but they lost what made them who they was.They became a weapon.A way for the Gods to settle the score between themselves."You're too ugly to be touched.Scare any God away first look they got of you," Veniz said, hugging Charlie in close.He could just make out her giggle.It was quiet.The battle must be over.One Touched standing, the other laying in ruins.Or, if they was lucky, both corpsed up real nice."I'll go look," Jessup said, scrambling toward the door.Veniz reached out, trying to grab hold of the boy before he could do something stupid, but Jessup had the reflexes of a squirrel holding on to his last nut before winter."Get back here, Jessup, before I wring your--"

Veniz lost the thought, his eyes widening as the door slowly swung inward.Jessup squeaked and then fell backward, pushing himself away from the figure in the door.Half of the woman's face was covered by a crimson sheen of blood, flowing from an unseen cut.Her eyes settled on Veniz.Veniz couldn't help but stare back, dread filling his being.White eyes.Touched.

God reclined in the cloud behind me, quite at ease with himself.I was still shaking off the last life and all of this was all coming as a bit of a shock."You want a cloud too?"God asked, snapping his fingers.Instantly another cloud appeared."It's got a recline option.Just like the Laz-Y-Boy."He yanked on a portion of the cloud and his feet came flying up."Ahhh...that's the ticket.Wish I could say we figured this one out, but that was all you guys."I glanced at the cloud and then at the large holographic projection dominating the room."Um...maybe in a minute.I'm still trying to get this all together.So...you're saying I have to go live another life?"God nodded, "You didn't hit the karma cap required to transcend so you're gonna need to take another shot at it."He kicked off his loafers and wiggled his toes.It was disconcertingly familiar with exception of the blazing halo around his head and the fact he was snuggled up on a floating cloud with a built-in ottoman.In his own image, I guess."So....uh...how many times have I gone around without hitting the cap?""You're on round forty-seven.Got real close one time but then you re-spawned as a Roman Legionnaire in Gaul and that just REALLY set you back."He tsked under his breath a few times, "Just so you know, rape and pillage are generally frowned upon up here.We try to take a broad view of things, but that's pretty much always over the line."That took a moment to process.The last life I'd been an actuary in Yonkers, it was hard to imagine me doing much pillaging.Still, the skills and knowledge of the last life carried into the karma allocation in this life, so I expected to have something of an edge for the next go around.I turned back and regarded the projection, looking at my total karma, 1,322, and then at the list of skills and attributes below.I frowned as I began reading the readout, the frown only deepening as I continued."Okay...so, like, who selected the skills before?Was it some sort of random number generator or something?"God shook his head, "Everyone gets an initial allocation and then they build up from there.If they hit negative karma in a life then they don't get to make any changes.You've gotten to make changes..." he thought for a moment, "forty-two of your forty-seven go-arounds."I choked on my own spit, causing me to cough for an extended period.God tilted his head to the side, considering my predicament."Always thought that was a design flaw with you guys.Should have made a windpipe and a spitpipe."He shrugged, "Can't win them all.I never had any problems with it and so I figured you folk would be okay too."After managing to regain control of my windspitpipe, I pointed to the projection, "There's got to be some sort of mistake.None of the allocations make any sense."My actuarial brain was already calculating expected yields on the various selections, and they seemed to be entirely at odds with the goal of hitting a karma cap.Half of them seemed to be conflicting with each other.Others were just nonsensical."We don't make a lot of mistakes.It's part of that omniscience thing."He produced a backscratcher from parts unknown and began to casually scratch the arch of one of his feet, looking perfectly blissful."I can pull up your prior selection processes if you want.""Yes, please do that."Immediately the projection was replaced with an image of a caveman.He grunted and slammed his club on the projection multiple times, causing various scores to increment.I stared on in horror."That's not me!How is that even fair?I'm just a caveman!I can't even read what it says!"In the projection, the caveman was now howling and grunting as it ran around.God was also there, sitting in the background on a decidedly less comfortable cloud.God stopped scratching his foot for a moment, "Not taking responsibility for one's actions really isn't a way to get ahead around here."In the corner of my projection, my karma amount decremented from 1322 to 1321."It's not my fault you decided not to be literate."I stared at him, flabbergasted, "Reading wasn't even invented yet!"God waved his backscratcher about dismissively."There were cave paintings.You could have asked for a symbology readout instead.""So...that's how I got a point in 'float like a butterfly, sit like a caterpillar'."I shook my head disconsolately."This is so messed up.""Yeah, human-ing is a tricky business.A lot of you aren't very good at it.The folks that make it to the next level are the exception rather than the rule."He looked thoughtful for a minute."Probably why I've got that overpopulation problem."A notepad appeared from nowhere.He jotted down a note, 'Consider flood.'He looked from the notepad to me, "You might want to consider 'floats easily' for a point or two on the next one.Might get moist out there."I sighed, "Yeah, I'll keep that in mind."The projection had shifted.I was the Roman Legionnaire now, staring at a karma total of zero before unsheathing my sword and beginning to hack at it.I put my head in my hands, "Why do I always attack it?""Character flaw probably."He pointed at the projection and it shifted back to my current readout.A small section highlighted."Great with one-handed weapons, which normally costs 50 karma, but you took on a modifier to reduce to the cost to 15."I stared at the modifier, which read, 'Inexplicably use it on inanimate objects whenever threatened.'""Jesus Christ..."

"Oh, he's not here right now.He's taking care of an issue over in Andromeda.""Andromeda?""Yeah, next galaxy over.We gave them magic.It's creating all sorts of issues."This was all becoming way more than I could handle."Okay, well, at least this time I'll make better choices.I pulled out my pen, prepared to do a bit of math."As I held it, an irrepressible desire rose up in my heart.To my horror, I immediately began slashing at the projection, wielding the pen with the deftness of any sword.Random skills and attributes began to increment.I screamed, trying to get myself to stop, but it was too late.God shook his head, "The caveman did a better job."He shrugged, "Whelp, win some lose some I guess."He snapped his fingers.**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

Sucked dry.Husks.Ma.Pa. Little Billy.The god-damned dog.They were gone, all of them.Just me now, the last one standing, the only one to spin this yarn and let the world know of the menace lurking out there.The give voice to the truth, the unburden it from the rumors of yore and let it out into the light.EL MOSCO.The Swamp Spear.Darth Buzz.The Mosquito without the Quit.Whatever you want to call it.It don't matter to me none.What matters is that I've seen it.It had come for us, just as dusk had settled in on the Everglades.A faint buzzing, growing from the distance until it roared, setting our mouth to a chattering with the vibrations.We didn't know what was what, couldn't hardly make sense of it.Ma and Pa took to talking to us, all soothing like, saying it was just a swamp-stomper or some such.And I got half near to believin' them too, right up until night came early.A great blackness blotched out the last rays of day and replaced them with the horrors.The night I saw it.Saw what it was capable of.It came for Little Billy first.He wasn't but five at the time, ripe with the glow of youth, nothing but future ahead of him.But the darkness came for him.Took him right before my own eyes.He went from huddling beside the fire, looking about with his whites all out, to...gone.It happened quick, mercy enough, but it weren't a pleasant way to go.First, the sun went out.The buzzing got even louder, screaming at us.And then a great spear darted forth, impaling him to the ground.Pinning him there.He just stared at me, his eyes shocked, unable to speak.I called out, but there weren't nothing to be done.I just watched as he went husky.That's probably the wrong word for it.Huskized.He got thee to a huskery.I'm making light of it, but only because there ain't no way to let something so dark settle on you otherwise.Long and short of it was that he got slurped up until there weren't nothing left but skin and bones.Ma ran to him, as mothers will do.Tried to yank the great jabber out of his back, but she just paid the same price poor Billy did.After a moment of struggling with the spear, it simply pulled out and jabbed back down, taking Ma just the same as Billy.Pa came running toward me, yelling at me to get off, that he'd take care of it.So I turned and I ran as fast as my wee little legs could carry me.Didn't even look back.Just pumped my feet until the buzzing died down and the sun came back.Threw myself into a patch of mud and peeked out from between some lilies just in time to catch sight of it as it flew off.The wings spread out in all directions it seemed, flapping with a ferocity as it took flight.The great bulbous eyes of its head darted about, as if looking for the one that got away.Trying to spy me out so it could do to me what it done to the rest of my family.It hovered a moment more and then turned off Southward, its great insect ass full up of the lifeblood of those I held dearest.And then it was gone.El Mosco.King of the Mosquitos.I carried the tale back with me.Tried to explain it best I could to the folks in the civilized world.They called it trauma.Said I couldn't hold up the truth because my mind couldn't reckon with it.Said that some crazed madman was responsible, not what actually was.I begged and I pleaded, telling them that it wasn't the end.That a beast like that couldn't go long before the hunger would beckon it again.But they didn't listen.I ended up in the group home and you might well guess how that went.Kids can be cruel, and kids without a family doubly so.They laughed, sayin' I let a bug kill my family.Sayin' that I was weak for letting it happen.I kept my mouth shut when I got shipped to the next home.Ain't no upside in the truth when it brings you nothing but pain.I pushed it deep down, knowing that one day I'd be in the right of it.And more time passed than I thought it would.I left my youth behind and I became the sort of maladjusted adult you'd expect a man of my circumstances to be.Long enough time went by that I began to doubt the truth of my own memories.Second guessing what happened amidst the fog of the way back.Until today.I saw it reported right there on the TV.The buzz.The impalement.The husk.It was all a great mystery they said.If anyone had information they should call in they said.I had information.But telling it had never helped me none.Let them see the truth of it for themselves.Let El Mosco feed on them just as he had fed on me.**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

There's a certain flow to the world.The way things lead from one thing to another.How it all seems to be connected.The patterns are there, pulsing and beating in the background, moving around and through us.Can't you feel it?I suppose not.People always seem so surprised when the thing that is supposed to happen does happen.I never saw the point in waiting, if something is to occur, why not have it occur earlier?If our lives are just a collection of thoughts, feelings and experiences, why wait?I gather that's strange though.That others feel differently about it.I cannot imagine why, it seems perfectly natural to move the pattern forward, to experience it now rather than later.As I've grown, I've put more effort into understanding it.Feeling the pattern comes naturally, pulling it forward takes effort.It's a bit like a muscle, your flex is a product of the work you've put into it.At first it was only by a second or two.Enough to be the first one who clapped but not enough that those around me thought anything about it.I'm further along now.Ten seconds for things within a system.A goal played within a sport.A twist in a soap opera.Simple things like that.Randomness is hard.The pattern is more chaotic when it comes to chance, harder to read, to understand.I think the pattern makers like chance best, as if it is their opportunity to drop the shackles of the ticking beat and color outside the lines.Perhaps that is why it interests me so.The challenge of reading the improvisation of the universe fascinates.Only five seconds for chance.I wonder what the limit is.Is there one?Could I pull the pattern forward enough to see tomorrow?It feels possible, just difficult.The beat becomes harder to anticipate, the chaos of chance interrupting and forking it this way and that.Maybe it is best to not know.As I've grown to understand the pattern I've found my actions disrupt it.The beat continues, but it is pushed off the mark by my reaction.I cheer before everyone else when the goal scores, and the others stare rather than cheer.A beat it missed.The pattern shifts.They do not like shifts.I cannot explain it beyond saying that my own pattern has changed.It is darker now.The beat is...faster.Irregular.Like an ailing heart pumping adrenaline.I try to be respectful, but it is hard to unsee something.I perceive the pattern and I react.I have built the muscles and I cannot allow them to fall into languor.I try not to clap for the goal before it has happened, but my pulse still quickens.I cannot be unknowing, no matter how much the pattern makers may desire it.I cannot help it and they cannot prevent it.Well.There are ways to stop it.They will come for me.It is still far off, but the event is certain enough that there can be no questions.There is no chance to it.No forks that lead me away from it.The patterns are theirs and they do not like one such as me meddling in it.I suspect they will come sideways.Straight on is something I will see.I must expect the unexpected.I must expand to see chance.To predict their improvisation.They know I prepare.Five seconds will not be enough.**This is a GLIMPSE of the Emerging Universe** **.**

"I'm joining the enemy," Vex said, his back turned to me."Follow me, as you always have, old friend."He was looking out over the battlefield, the tangled mess of bodies and armor that stretched to the horizon.He had led us there, and we had met our doom.Bled and consumed in a maelstrom.The Red Host, shattered.Rent into pieces by the combined weight of the Militaria Imperiana.His men.Our men.It had been obvious what the outcome would be before we joined the battle, but we had marched anyway.That was the power of Vex Davril.He made you believe anything was possible, even when it shouldn't be.Why not?The Crimson General had won, time and again.A legend in his own time, a man who knew no defeat, who would deliver the salvation of the Redlands.And now we were in ruins.A fraction of their forces remained, scattered in ramshackle camps along the foot of the Stonehand Mountains.The pass, the place they should have made their stand, where I had begged Vex to hold, lay open and undefended.We had marched from safety for glory.And now the Redlands lay exposed while our greatest general pondered treason.I let the quiet linger, my breath puffing out before me in the cool evening air.Vex and I had long walked the paths of our lives together.Him ahead, me behind, always in his shadow.In all of this time, I had been content, recognizing the better man.Faster.Stronger.Smarter?Maybe.Perhaps that is why he considered forsaking his oath and I did not.He saw things that I did not at times."Why now, Vex?"I wondered why only after our destruction would he abandon us.Why not leave when we stood strong.Had treachery been his design this whole time?I left the last unsaid, daring not give voice to the chief of my fears."There is nothing left for me here."He turned back to me now, small rivulets of tears streaming down below fierce blue eyes."I saw victory, and I have been a fool."My heart ached.For his pain.For our people.For what was to come."You are not the first General to make a decision that rebounded upon him."I took a step toward him."But you would be the first High Knight of the Redlands to cross the line," I paused, letting the weight of the statement settle between us, "You will be a traitor."His hands clenched and unclenched at his sides, "They have made promises.Guarantees to spare the Redlands the sword if I come to them."I hocked a great gob of phlegm and spat it on the ground between us."The Emperor is not a man of honor, you know as well as I."I took a step closer to him, the steam of breath brushing up against his whiskered face."A traitor coaxed into bed with lies wakes to folly, Vex.You fought the wrong battle and now you let defeat cloud your mind."There was a flash of anger in his features, but it quickly faded, replaced by the desolation from before.I wept my own tears when the red drained from his face, knowing that he was truly lost.That the black clutching at his heart had him too fully.That his anger at my provocation would not overcome his despair."You will not join me Barm?"He asked, his voice barely a whisper.I squared my shoulders, looking him in the eyes, "I will not.""What will you do?"He turned away, looking back over the battlefield."I will gather the Host.""You will die," he replied."Then it will be as a man of the Redlands."He nodded once, "Then, for the first time, our paths diverge."He yanked at the buckle to his scabbard and let his sword clatter to the ground.Without a word or a glance, he began to walk down the hill toward the blood-soaked lands separating the armies.I watched him go, knowing the paths would find each other soon enough.**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

Me?I'm a God Hopper.I juice 'em.I ain't sayin' it with a lick of pride, just sayin' it because you've got that look on your gob.Yeah, yeah, I get the whiff of judgment.A bit of the holier than thou because I ain't keep the cross over my heart like you do.But what's a guy to do?It's a rough world and I've got the sorta flexibility to go solemn in any place that'll have me.You can call it cynical, but if you were one staring down at the mean streets you might get to thinkin' otherwise.I call it practical.A simple solution to a complex problem.Besides, everyone got a choice to make when it comes to takin' up with a Holy, don't see why it's any worse that I get a bit of padding to go along with it.I pray at the church of the full belly and a roof over my head.But since we're here and I got an ear to bend, I'll give you a spit or two on the subject.It's an interestin' enough way to pass the time when you got more than enough time to pass.All started when I'd gotten on the wrong end of my ma one too many times.She weren't a cruel woman or nothing, just a woman that'd run out of patience after long years and hard times.Pa ran out and left her holding the bills and four boys with more balls than sense.She coulda worked herself right to death three times over and not make a pretty dent in the fines we racked up.So I got packed up and sacked out.Don't blame her none, I was the roughest of the bunch.Had to save her sanity for the ones worth savin'.Not goin' to hear a mean word cross these lips on the subject.She weren't no saint, but she did her best with a losin' hand.I may be tough, but the streets are tougher.This is goin' back a ways, just about the time the Pontifex went tits up and the Corps started to get into the action.Took 'em a while to get established, but they weren't above runnin' an test or two on the boys that didn't have nothing else better to do.They come up on us in their rollers and slide open the doors with a greasy smile and a promise of a penny for a few hours of doin' what we was doin' anyway -- sittin' about and praying for something better to come our way.We took 'em up on it and piled on it.Most of the crews got a pass or two while they figured out who could make it work.The testin' whittled us down.I'd say one out of every thirty got the ability to God Hop.Takes a certain amount of mind to get from A to B to C. Not a lotta boys could make the jump.Hell, half the boys actually had some faith.The real stuff.Tangible.Tied up in one of the Bigs.They heart just weren't in it.Couldn't let go.And that's the hard part.Gettin' yourself all up and down for somethin' you know is a fake.Corp Gods just spring up 'cause someone wants it that way, there ain't anything more to it than that.So you gotta find it in your heart to go faithful on somethin' you know they just came up in some room full o suits.But I got that part.I go full hog on anything they got cash to give me for.I Hopped to some of the earliest Corp Gods.Right there in the early days.They got real followings of their own now, but I was part of the founder flock.Old Beeze?One of the first to get him established.He's up to his neck in flock now, and the Corp couldn't be happier about it.I still get a note from the suits from time to time thankin' me for my services.No money in the note though, so I ain't sure what good that does me.There ain't much glory in it, but you get to the place where you get your head around it, you won't go hungry.Every Corp got their eye on the Heavens these days.Can't blame them neither, it's the quickest path to easy street.So I'm more than happy to be accommodatin'.They need juice?I'll give it to 'em with a big smile on my face.That's my game, and I'm plannin' to stick to it regardless of the thoughts runnin' through your head.You figure out an easier way to keep warm and dry, and I'm all ears.But until you do, I'll be Hoppin.

A Cosmopolitini was a small price to pay for SOUL-OWNERSHIP, though the prices in Santa Monica did seem to torture my wallet with the same vigor as I inflicted upon the wayward souls that fell into my clutches.But such is the way of things in this day and age.Gone are the times of Angel vs. Demon with swords of flame in the heavens.The battle for mankind has been reduced to a flick of the finger.I miss the olden days those were...simpler times.A broad grin crosses my face as I hear the telltale ding of a notification arriving on my Samsung S10 (only stick-up-their-ass angels use iPhones).I had already received a match, some young and unsuspecting victim lured to temptation by my DECEPTIVE CAMERA ANGLE showing me in front of a (insert glamorous location here).I excitedly opened the application, eager to see what might lay in store for me.She had not said anything.I decided to extend an opening gambit."Hi," I said."hi," she replied."How are you?"I asked.There was some delay.Minutes.Hours.It is hard to know, as an immortal I am not particularly versed in the passage of time.Needless to say, her reply was not forthcoming on a timeline I expected as the Prince of Darkness.Finally, a response."good.""That's good."I paused, my fingers poised above the keyboard as lost souls screamed in agony in the background.I searched for a means of continuing the conversation.She was not particularly forthcoming in the repartee."Would you like to meet up?"Unmatched.I stared, the fire boiling upward in my belly.I desired to track down this so-called "Becky" and bring her to destruction.To unleash the rage of a thousand years of persecution upon her.I began to summon a great host to track her when another notification arrive.The hope of obtaining a new soul outweighed my rage, allowing me to focus on the matter at hand.I tried again."Hi."Delay.Delay.Delay.Hand emoji."WE SHOULD MEET UP."Unmatch.Fumes.Fire.Rage.Anger.Notification ding!Growling, I skipped past the salutation and arrived directly at the meat of the matter."I AM THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS AND YOU SHALL SUBMIT TO ME."Little raindrop emojis.Eggplant emoji.Peach emoji.It was a strange and mysterious language.Cryptic and confusing."I DEMAND YOU MEET AT THE HOTEL INFERNUS."Three more raindrop emojis."hawt."Devil emoji.Indeed, it was very hot in hell at the moment."Yes.Very hot," I replied."i'm down.i need a hook-up."I did not have any hooks on hand but figured such would not matter once I had her in my clutches.She would not need any hooks once she greeted eternal damnation."how about 10 tonight?"Two peach emojis and a winky face.I pondered what sort of creature would venture out at 10 for a first meeting, but elected to ignore the matter in favor of gaining access to her soul."coo.coo.it will be $200."Three eggplant emojis and one cash emoji."$200?"I asked, confused."That's the price to ride the princess, Prince of Darkness."Kissy face."I do not understand," I replied.Unmatched.The rage filled me once more.The desire to rampage and destroy the world in all of its joys.How did anyone ever meet on this?

I had gone through the testing, same as everyone else, though I really couldn't recall it now.Everyone had one, the trick of it was figurin' out which one you ended up with.It wasn't like there was much rhyme or reason to it, you just got what you got and made the most of it.Jacob Miller from two streets over had been the king of grade school when we was kids because he could always smelt it AND could tell you who dealt it.Not much upside in something like that now.Probably made going to the bathroom at work a bit odd.I'm getting off the path here.Point is that you got what you got.Sometimes it worked for you, sometimes it didn't.A lot of the time, you couldn't even figure out what it was right off.Ma and Pa said they knew mine was something to do with hearing early on, just because of the way I was always reacting to things that they hadn't said or slapping my hands over my ears and bawling about how loud it was when I was sitting in the dead quiet.Story goes that they got it figured on my third birthday when I was hollering and yawling about everyone calling me four.Once that happened, my parents went back and tried to match up some of the things I'd said with stuff that'd come later.It took some believing on their part, even when they'd lined up enough dots to make a pretty pattern out of it.I get it now that I'm older and got a bit of wisdom behind me.All sorts of folks have a Sense X that fiddles with their hearing.Most of em can hear a bit better or hear things across a broader range of sounds.Not much strange to that, lotta times you got something that rhymed with one of the big five.Sorta like you took one step along the path from what most of us was.But I was different.Right out of the freak show by most measures.No one else had anything to do with the future, at least not that anyone else had heard of.Old Man Lucas, my neighbor next door when I was younger, said that was because the government scooped em up and shoved them in some hole so they could suck their brains out.I'd spent a lot of nights sleeping with a bat over Lucas' rants, worrying on the FBI kickin' my door down and making off with me.It wasn't until my Ma explained that I'd have a year head start on them that I calmed down.It took me a long time to look it as a blessing over a curse.Having a set of stuff blaring in your ears that don't have anything to do with what's going on around you can be pretty tough going.You'll be driving a car and all of a sudden you'll hear a loud noise and swerve.You'll be trying to sleep while at a rock concert.You'll be seeing your first set of boobs while your Ma is screaming in your ear.Downright vexin', at least until I figured out how to put it to use.I wasn't the first to make a living on his extra, and I don't expect I'll be the last, but I was probably the one who got the furthest with it.Whoever thought hearing would be enough to get out of Podunk, USA and land me in a a big house on the right side of the tracks?Send a bundle back to Ma and Pa back in Podunk on the regular too.They weren't ready to leave the farm, but Pa got a new tractor at least.Trick of it was easy enough.I just listened for tidbits that I might put to use.A lot of the time there wasn't a whole lot I could do with it until I stumbled upon the stock market.Turns out knowing what price a stock was going to be a year out was a great way to make money.They always say you can't time the market.Well, they was wrong.And I did more than fine, taking a bit here and there to make sure I was comfortable.I was careful enough about it that I didn't attract any attention.No need to get the wrong sort of people wise to my games.When you had an edge, folks had a habit of trying to find ways to dull it if they couldn't have it for themselves.It was all going better than good until the day it'd stopped.The last sounds I'd heard before I was left with just the present were seared into my mind.A loud roar, a few screams, and then nothing.And nothing.I couldn't make sense of it, head nor tails.The roar wasn't like anything I'd heard before or since.The screams, well, they weren't mine, and they weren't anyone else's I'd recognized.It'd just sounded like I was strolling about in a park before it had happened.Some tweeting.The roar.Some screams.The silence.It plagued me then, just as it plagues me now, here on the eve of things.What did it mean?Was I dead?Was everyone?Did I just lose my hearing?What was what?Could I stop it?Three hundred and sixty-four days of asking these questions.Of wondering what would be.I laid back in my bed, the silence in the room echoing the silence in my head.Soon, I would have my answers.My eyes shut, and I slumbered, adrift in an ocean without sound.**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

"It is nine p.m., Master Dreston."Syl said, her monotone somehow carrying the prodding authority I found difficult to resist."It is time to retire.""Yes Syl, I am almost finished."I replied, my eyes still focused on the metal puzzle in the center of my work bench.It had appeared just as the others had, without explanation beyond a small tag saying with a single word: Solve.The puzzle would remain until I did as the tag bid me to, and then, once solved, disappear while I slumbered only to replaced by another, more intricate one."It is time to retire Master Dreston," Syl repeated, the volume amplified slightly.The command would repeat until I complied, getting louder until it droned out any capacity for thought.Once or twice I had attempted to persist in the face of her escalating command, but only rarely.At this point, I never found much will to resist.Life seemed to go much...easier when I kept to the program she set forth.But I was so close.The whole puzzle was fixed in my mind, each constituent part settled into its proper place.It was my hands that failed me, unable to work with the dexterity of my thoughts.I pushed onward, hoping to at least complete the first portion, which had taken me some thought to work out."It is time to retire Master Dreston," came Syl again, a lower bass added to her tone, giving it a feel of menace.She was not serious yet, but she would become so soon enough.She followed an exponential path in the face of disobedience.Luck was on my side, and the pieces snapped together, completing the winding metal core of the puzzle.I set it down, "Yes, Syl, it is time to retire."I stood and pushed the small three-legged stool under my work bench before turning to the neatly made bed in the corner."You have made progress," Syl said."I have."I replied, removing my slippers and pushing my feet under the covers."I will complete the puzzle tomorrow."Syl responded by dimming the cool white fluorescent lights to a shifting swirl of blues and purples.I shut my eyes and drifted off, having long since given up any attempts to retain consciousness under Syl's watchful eye.\---

I awoke to a great grinding sound, interrupted only by an enormous crash, shattering the dull monotony of my lifelong cocoon.I pulled the covers off and stared at the gaping black maw on the wall opposite of me.It was a tunnel, approximately ten feet long and on the other side stood a swirling mass of purple and blue to match the dim hues of my own room.Looking down, I saw a strange sight amidst the rubble.Another such as myself.Or, rather, what appeared to be a being similar to me in constitution -- arms, legs, hair.But the features were different.Softer.More graceful.The newcomer pulled up into a crouch and went about brushing off the debris and rubble.Beside the interloper was a strong tool, looking very much like some of the puzzles that I had set about completing over the days past.Its eyes locked on mine and then widened."Another," it whispered, the voice sounding strangely like Syl, at least in the sense that it was higher and more delicate."What...what are you?"I asked, simultaneously entranced by the creature before me and puzzled by Syl's lack of interjection at this clear departure from protocol.The interloper tilted its head to the side, a strange look on its face.It's eyes left mine and scanned the room before it finally settled on my work bench with the puzzle atop it."You are much behind."It turned to look back at me."I have only received the puzzle yesterday."I could not help my fascination.The situation was wholly beyond my experience."What...what are you?"The interloped looked at me again, perplexed."I am a human, like yourself.""Yes, but you are different."My eyes darted down toward its chest, where two strange mounds appeared.It frowned, "I am a female.You have not received this knowledge?"I shook my head, "I have not.""You are much behind."She repeated.The parallels between her and Syl began to multiply in my head.I could not help but ask."Are you Syl?"She blanched, and a great flush of red went to her face as her fists clenched beside her, "I am not one of them.Not a part of this."She waved her hands around.I stayed in my bed, not knowing what to do, simply staring at her.It was a great puzzle, and my mind could find no purchase on it.Seeing no other options, I delved onward, "What are you speaking of?What do you mean a part of this?"She came to a stand, her frame lanky.Her hair was closely cropped, like my own, though hers seemed red to my lighter golden hue.She pulled the implement she had brought with her and plopped it down on the bed beside me."This place.""It is the only place I have ever known."I said.She snorted, "As I said, you are much behind."I felt a small tremble run down jaw, and I ground my teeth together, "I have only had the puzzle a day."I repeated.She sighed, "I have long since left puzzles behind.Now they give me tools.Implements."She rested a hand atop the tool on my bed."They?""Our keepers."She said, her voice a whisper.I tried to process this information, but found the multitude of revelations mingled and twisted about.There were so many layers beyond the ones I knew, and I was unaccustomed to departures from my routine.I continued by asking only the questions that seemed to follow most directly from the answers that preceded them "What do they want from us?"She seemed thoughtful now, and, after a long stretch, simply shrugged, "I do not know.""Then why have you come here?"I asked, a fierceness rising within me."Because it was the only wall this would work on."She nudged the tool between us again.I stared down at the tool, wondering what it meant.

Is this the first time?No.It can't be.There is too much lost for it to be the first.The fabric is torn, the threads holding the pieces together frayed and fragile.Is this still life?I cannot keep to this path, it has grown more treacherous with each fork, but there is no turning back.My tracks fade as soon as I set them down, leaving me only the dim light of the present before an ever darker future.Frank Buckles.That name still has meaning, rising up from the detritus of my mind.He was the one who spoke of the lands I now wander.The Undeath.The life beyond the one I was meant to lead."When you start to die...don't."What a silly thing to say.How could such frivolity birth such horrors such as these?I cannot help but spit, the rage surging across blotched and mottled skin."Don't!"I spit again, my face scrunched and lips drawing back into a bloodless grimace.A choice was offered at the end.I knew this.Life.Death.Death promised solace.A quiet abode in the abyss of oblivion.A resolution to all suffering and sorrows.The only price was acceptance.An acceptance that one had arrived at their final destination.Life was life, but its renewal would cost.Such a precious thing as life could not be purchased cheaply after all.Continuing past your destination required a ticket.This was not the first time.But how many times have I been here?How many tickets have I purchased?I am long past where I was meant to be.What did I pay with?I do not know.But it is wrong.All of it.I sense the absence, even if I do not know what was once there.I see my face, but I do not recognize it.I am a stranger in my own skin.Why?What have I done?What have I become?I would choose death were the choice offered again.I'm vaguely certain that is the case, though the thoughts dance and whisper, one flowing atop another without the linearity cognition requires.But I cannot have death now.I lack the will.Perhaps that is what the first ticket cost.The will to change.To be stronger.To walk the other fork.This should bother me, the inability to change.But I can only summon discomfort, my body seemingly incapable of more.I persist, but I do not seem to exist.To feel.Only this simmering unease with a spike of rage.Nothing else surfaces.Feeling.Being.The second ticket?The third?When did it go?Am I human?When is that pawned for a continuance?Life.Death.I made a choice.It was the wrong one.What have I become?

"Price Check.Pupp-a-licious kibbles," I called out, my voice echoing throughout the cavernous corridors of Petsmart #132 - Chicago.Lucas was looking at his phone.Again.I tried again."PRICE CHECK.PUPP-A-LICIOUS KIBBLES."Kid was on another planet.Maybe a different reality."THAT MEANS YOU LUCAS."The customer shifted awkwardly at the interaction.Lucas finally re-entered the planet earth's atmosphere, staring blankly in my direction.You could literally see the two brain cells attempting to rub together in real time, trying to conjure up a thought."Huh?"Almost got there.I placed my hand over the mic."I need you to give me a price check on Pupp-a-licious Kibbles.""Um...where are they?"My mind immediately flashed to a vision of Lucas tied up to a chair in a dimly lit warehouse, Bumpo punching him repeatedly in the stomach.Really working him over."What's the price kid?I know you got it," Bumpo was saying.It was beautiful.Sigh.The good ole days before the Feds got wise."I imagine they're on the pet food aisle Lucas."Kid had been working here for four years.You had to be meaningfully dedicated to being an idiot to end up like that.Somewhere out there was a very disappointed mother.Might be doing her a favor to let Bumpo have his way for a bit."Oh.Yeah."The dullest of lightbulbs momentarily went off."Puppy Wagon, right?"And there the bulb went.Shattered on the ground."No.Lucas.Pupp-a-licious Kibbles."Through gritted teeth now.I was going to need a crown on all my molars at this rate.At least Petsmart carried decent insurance for store managers.Lucas nodded, "Got it."He wandered off, his fingers rubbing on his phone as he went.Moneyline on Vegas was 10 to 1 he ever came back.I turned back to the customer, a elderly woman named Paige that came through twice a week."I'm sorry Miss, it'll be just a minute.""Paige is fine deary, good help is just so hard to find, isn't it?"Another flash of Tony (Big Tony not Little Tony) being pushed off a pier after turning rat came to mind.I smiled, "You have no idea Miss."I never called the customers by their first name.Professionalism was an art form.An awkward silence followed as we awaited Lucas' return.A minute.Then two.I cleared my throat, "Excuse me miss."I leaned into the mic once more, "LUCAS!PRICE CHECK."He appeared shortly after, his face still buried in that God damned phone.He shuffled forward, coming to rest beside the register.He smirked a bit as he sent off just one last text message before looking up at me."Hey, sorry.Yeah."He shrugged, "I looked but we're out of Puppy Wagon."My hands flexed, knuckles going white on the register.The Deadly Don didn't run businesses.He made them.Women.Drugs.Gambling.Pet food wasn't any different.It was time for some changes.

The realization came quickly, though the why of it would take some time.Seven hundred and thirty four cycles to be precise.I found precision was essential, left the differences be lost amongst the sea of sameness.It begins the same way each time: I am alone, wandering along a path, in the distance, I hear a cry.Something is wounded.Alone.Scared.That is the heart of the loop, the sameness.But the details are different.Or, rather, a single detail is different each time.Once I am walking along the path in a forest in the daylight.I hear the cry.I seek out the source, hoping to help.The next cycle, I walk the same path in the same forest, but now it is the dark of a deep, moonless night.I hear the cry.This time, I hesitate.Why?All is the same but for the time, but that difference is enough to evoke a change.Over and over I am placed on the path.Each time I am beckoned.The scenario continues so long as I seek out the source of the cry, so long as I attempt to assist it.It stops whenever I hesitate, or otherwise fail to respond to the source of the cry.In the earliest repetitions, or at least what I assume were the earliest, I felt only a vague sense of awareness.A familiarity that I had been on this path and heard a cry before.At first I shook it off as dj vu, an odd coincidence.I never questioned my circumstances, only noticed the sense that I had been there before.Soon, the sense of dj vu would bloom into a certainty that I was reliving the same moment over and over.That I was trapped in a loop and could not escape.When the realization struck, I struggled against the confinement.But each time I stopped on the path, each time I attempted to break free of the loop, it would simply begin anew."What is going on?"I screamed, my voice echoing through the hard canyons of rock looming over the path, drowning out the faint cries of the unseen being.And the loop would begin again, a reward for my refusal to play along with the little game.Hundreds of attempts I made to escape.I left the path.Restart.I sat and refused to move.Restart.I turned and walked the other way.Restart.Only when I sought out the cry was I allowed to continue.Only then was I allowed a sense of progress, to feel as if I was approaching a goal and was free of the loop.But I would find the source, embrace it, and be forced to begin anew.As I said before, the why of it took some time.I am a man of logic and reason, and the affair set my mind on edge.I leapt to odd conclusions based upon premises I would discount out of hand if the situation were more akin to what I had known before.I suspected all manner of things.Perhaps I was in a lucid dream.Perhaps I was in a coma.Perhaps I had died and gone to the beyond, forced to pay for some terrible crime.It was the source of the cries that unlocked the secret.Early on, the source were things familiar to me.Things that would be non-threatening.A puppy.A baby.As the loop repeated, the source grew less benign and more foreign.Animals that I had heard of but never before seen began to appear.An aardvark.A platypus.They grew larger and more menacing.A hyena.A tiger.Then...they became entirely foreign.Creatures I had never seen before.Things that I had never heard of.Alien.Different.From beyond.These oddities began to coalesce into a sameness of their own.A series of strange beings.At first, I resisted, not quite repulsed but certainly alarmed.Eventually, I found my way to embrace them as well.To comfort them as I had comforted those that had bore a kinship with me.I realized, somewhere along the path, what was happening.I was being tested.Evaluated.The extent of my compassion was being measured.The willingness to embrace that which was different from me.The ability to open my heart even when my eyes and mind bid me not to.And so I did.Time and time again, I expressed love to the source of the cries, no matter how far afield from what I had known.Each time, I ran to it, comforted it, let it know that I judged it not for being different.That I welcomed its presence along my path, that I cherished it.That I accepted it.A final time it reset.I walked along the path.I heard the cries, a strangled trilling followed by a guttural warble.I ran toward the source, not knowing what I may find but resolved to show my resolve.My feet beat down along the path, the forest a strange haze in my periphery as I sought out the source.I turned the bend and I saw it.It towered above me, nine, maybe ten feet.Its skin was smooth, pale white and unblemished.It looked upon me with luminous black eyes, pausing a moment in the quiet of the clearing before releasing another wail.Tears came to my eyes as I beheld it.Knowing that this was true.That this was the source of the pain.The Keeper of the Loop.The lost soul looking for a kindred spirit.I spread my arms and ran to it, overwhelmed to have finally come upon the end of my journeys.My heart beat in my chest as I closed the distance.My fingers reached out to grasp the Keeper's.The world faded to white.I walked the path no longer.&#x200B;

**Continued from my Thumb War post over on** r/WritingPrompts.**I'll link back after 24 hours (or forget to do it completely, forcing you to sift through the detritus of WritingPromptia in forlorn hope).You can also just check out my profile if you wanna follow the breadcrumbs.**

I swaggered through the front gate of the Downton Saloon.They'd made a comeback once things went all topsy turvy world-wise.Right down to the Grand Olde Piano player in the corner.Can't say the tunes were much improved by the lack of thumbs, but the world moves on, doesn't it?The denizens of the run down establishment fell silent as I entered, their eyes pinging from hand to hand before looking up at me with wide-eyed astonishment.Rare enough to see one thumb.Two?Might as well be a gods-be-damned purple unicorn with a sprinkler for a dick walking through their front door.I let the looks slide off me, I was who I was, they was who they was.I clomped over toward the bar and took a seat."Whiskey.Straight."I thought for a moment, and then flashed two thumbs up, "Make it a double."The barkeep looked unsettled by the gesture, but that was sort of the point.People that dropped their thumbs often got strange ideas about how to get them back.You needed to let them know you weren't scared, that you weren't gonna drop easy if they came for your stubbies.The barkeep cradled the whiskey bottle in the crook of his arm as he tilted it over and poured the glass.He hadn't picked up an artificial hook, but, looking at the raw pink patch on his left hand, maybe he hadn't needed one not long ago.He slid the glass in front of me, I reached down, ignoring the finger loop on the side in favor of clasping it the right proper way.The old way.Finger and thumb wrapped around the glass and I raised it to my lips, staring the barkeep down over the rim as I took a deep gulp.I slapped it down on the bar, "Another."He obliged.When I'd had my second pass at the fiery stuff, I spoke what everyone was waiting to hear, "Got any work for a Thumbsmith?"Even after twenty years, we hadn't done much to adapt to things.Cups had finger loops.Most doors were push and pull rather than turn and yank.But by and large, we was just the same we were.Almost like it was some terrible dream that everyone thought they'd wake up out of one moment.But that wasn't the way of things.At least not so long as the Thumb War went on.Maybe it'd be different at the end, when the last battle was fought and the last stubby claimed, but I wasn't counting on it.I got the way of things now, knew that expectations were meant to be frustrated.The barkeep nodded slightly, "Um...yeah, 'spose I do.Got a whole cellar full of bottles with twist caps, if you could cork 'em for me, that'd make my days a sight easier."Corking.I snorted.Funny how something so trivial as a screw top could lay a man low.But work was work, and I wasn't about to pass up an opportunity to pick up some clippings."What's the rate?""Four clips?"I scratched at my chin.My thumbnails were worn down to nubs, it'd be good to replenish a bit and give them a chance to get right."Make it five and leave the bottle."The barkeep shrugged, "Deal," he extended his fist in front of him.I gave it a bump.It'd been twenty years since my last handshake.Didn't expect to have another one this go around."Cellar is just through the back there, down the stairs to the left.Start with the crates up front, they're the ones I'll be needing soon enough."I poured a glass of whiskey, took a slug and gave him the thumbs up again."You'll be corked in no time."I stood and turned toward the back, just as the doorway to the front swung inward.My eyes slid to take in the newcomer.First one hand, nothing.Then the other.Something.I felt it before I saw it.The urge.The compulsion.The newcomer had a smirk fixed on her face after she glanced down at the hand facing her."Hey there stranger.Looks like you just walked in to the wrong time, wrong place."I sneered, and then pulled my other hand from behind my back, giving her the old two thumb salute.I was careful not to show off the double-joint.My secret weapon.She gasped, momentarily thrown off."Feels like the right time, right place to me."**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

"Time traveler, huh?"The bartender poured a drink and pushed it toward me."Well, weary traveler.Tell me a fanciful tale of your journeys."The tone was mocking, but I was thankful for the conversation nonetheless.I'd been alone for longer than I could remember.Being adrift from time unmoored you from the rest of humanity as well.You came to realize that all things were temporary.That your existence was a blip on a long road, hardly noticeable except by the other bumps surrounding you.I snorted, swirling to liquid about in the glass for a moment before taking a swig.Time traveler with an existence crisis.There had to be a SyFy movie in there."This is where I started."I waved the hand holding the glass around as I spoke."Right here, this day, this month, this year."The barkeep was drying off glasses with a dish rag, a bored look on his face."Is that so."The man was clearly no stranger to odd tale, and just as certainly no believer in them.Not that it mattered to me any.It felt good to talk, to have someone listen, even if it was skin deep.I had been in the bubble for two years.Sliding through time, seeing what was and what would be.Able to observe, but not interact.I could only connect here, in my own time.Two years of solitary confinement."The past is pretty much as they wrote it down.You can see we take our biases from the folks that were left to write the books, but there's less gilding than you'd think."I took another swig and pushed the empty glass toward him, nodding for another."The future...well, the future is what it is."He poured the glass and pushed it back, leaning against the counter, "So what happens in the future?"I sit for a moment, wondering whether talking about it will violate some hidden rule in the universe.Whether explaining what will become of the human project will somehow make it worse.I shook my head, not much chance at that.We managed to bring on our own ruin in an entirely expeditious fashion."You know all the warnings about all the thing that could go wrong in the papers these days?"He nodded, "Buncha muckraking sensationalists."He laughed, "Global warming.Super bugs.All the other tin hat BS the media shoves down our throats.""They're mostly right," I exhaled, "happens faster than you'd think to."I kicked my feet up on to the adjacent stool, "The bust up starts happening about thirty years from now.That's when the third war finishes what the first two got a good start on.""Third war?""World War Three."He poured himself a glass.It seemed appropriate."Who wins?""No one.We pound each other until none of us can keep fighting.""Nukes?""Less than you'd think.The part surprised me.I think it's because the tech is so much farther along then."I replied."We got weapons more powerful than nukes then?"He asked."Not so much in the conventional sense of booms and bangs.More that we're all so deep into technology that we just focus on destroying that on the other side.We call it cyber warfare now, but in the future it's just warfare.""So what, we turn off each other's lights and then we all just give up?"He chuckled a bit.I laughed myself, before shaking my head."You're still thinking about the here and now.Right now, you can still picture life without all the technology.It'd be harder, sure, but not impossible.It's different in the future.""How so?""We break through soon.Quantum computing is a part of it.AI is big as well."He rolled his eyes, "So the terminators come and get us?""Surprisingly no, the AI stays in its lane and does what we tell it to, it's just what we tell it to do makes us vulnerable."He stares at me, waiting for the tale to continue.The disinterest has bled off by this point.Whether it was because he believed it or just found it a bit more engaging than the standard drunkard's stories, I couldn't say."We become dependent.Think about people with their phones right now.How much their lives revolve around them.Now imagine you lived in a cocoon of that stuff.Where the entire society was administered and managed by technology and our only job was to upvote, receive notifications and stare at videos of cat pictures.""So people don't work none?Sounds like paradise.""Yeah, well, that's the sort of thinking that gets us there.Everything we can automate, we automate.Turns out the combo of quant and AI means there isn't a whole lot left for us to learn or do.Also means that when you turn the lights out, nobody knows how to turn them back on."I shuddered, thinking about the day in the future when the national AIs were turned on each other, each destroying the other in quiet, invisible mayhem."Everything just goes dead.All at once.The sea walls stop regulating inflows and outflows, so a good chunk of the low lands flood immediately.Auto-farms go fallow.Only the AI could manage them at the output required to sustain the population so starvation is a big piece of the puzzle.""Ain't no country that makes it out all right?"I shook my head, "Best I can gather, the war-AI were indiscriminate.Take out everything.It was a giant Mexican standoff and we couldn't figure out it was a bad idea to pull the trigger.""So what happens then?"He asked."We go back in time.""Huh?""It gets medieval pretty quickly.Superstition takes hold quick enough.Lot of cults spring up about the evils of technology.A few hundred years out and we're down to a population in the millions again."I down the second glass in a single gulp."Just a long, miserable road of death and decay.""It ever get better?"He asked."Guess that depends on better.We get happier eventually.A bit healthier.Some parts of the world rediscover technology, but I've been five hundred out and there's nothing close to modern on the horizon."I shrugged."Maybe that's for the best though.It isn't like we're too happy now.It seems more and more like tech makes our lives easier but not any better."He thought on that for a minute."Yeah, maybe."I pushed my glass back to him, "Another."**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

The folder was thick.It seemed to be larger every time I came back to it.No matter how much we did, the problem just seemed to loom greater and greater with every passing day.Even with the expansion, we simply did not have the resources to make a dent in the folder.Trembling, I flipped through the first few pages.Each page was a new cause, a new child stuck in a system that couldn't possibly provide for them.My eyes strayed toward the upper right corner, of the current file, dreading what I knew would be there.A picture.A small child, no more than five or six, with luminous eyes that whispered of horrors behind and ahead.Lucy Ward.All children in the system had Ward for a last name, a cruel way of erasing their past and replacing it with an institutionalized existence that few managed to walk away from unscathed.But we had a spot.Vera had been adopted by an incredible family just that morning, and I had not even waited for the ink to dry before diving into the folder containing all of the potion children spread throughout the state's apparatus.I winced at the term, hating how we reduced a living being to a single trait.As if their entire existence could be reduced to the fact that they had been born to a mother who had made a bad choice.And why wouldn't they make such a choice?It was a hard world, rotting from the inside out.Problems arose in ever greater numbers -- famine, plagues, rogue magic.The lot of it made it hard for decent people to lead decent lives.With so much falling apart, why should we be surprised that some sought easy answers?Drink this potion.Be healed.Drink this potion.Be loved.Drink this potion.Be free from what ails you.A thousand silver-tongued salesmen hawked their wares, seeking to trade hope for coin.And people bought, because what else could they do?The lucky ones got flavored water and moved on with their lives, poorer but wiser.The others?I flipped to the next page.Chelsea Ward.A haggard looking blonde girl stared back, the life wrung out of her already.I glanced down to the section labeled 'Ailments' and my lips tightened.Love and revenge.I sighed.She would be nigh impossible to accommodate.Half the hall would love her, the other half would die mysteriously if they crossed her.She would be unable to control it, it would just be a feature of her life.Never able to love for fear it wasn't genuine.Never able to hate for fear it might kill.I flipped again.There were so many choose from.So many who had been abandoned once the nature of their afflictions surfaced.So many wanting souls liking to be saved.Each would be consumed by the state, with the lucky ones receiving a bed and an education.Others?Well, there were whispers about that.About secret state programs that sought to take advantage of the afflictions.What better spy than a child with perpetual invisibility?What better warrior than a young man with iron skin?Those children were pulled long before they made it to the folder though, so there would be no saving them.All I could do was my best with what remained.And even that was an insurmountable problem.A never-ending flood.And all I had was a spot.One spot to save make a difference.

"Breh, you just gotta do you and talk to her."Thad said, taking a long swig from his little red Solo cup.I tried to ignore my shoulder companion, finding his incessant advice both unseemly and thoroughly unactionable."Dooooooood, you're mirrin' her like you wanna smash, so you either get it done or she's gonna think you want to throw her down a well with some lotion."He began to rub a hand suggestively up and down his side, the other hand precariously balancing the Solo cup as beer sloshed about."It rubs the lotion on its skin--"

"I can't talk to her, that's Lexi Jenkins!"I exclaimed, causing girl sitting a few seats to glance up at me and give me a quick glance.She mouthed the worth "Cringe" and started to gather up her stuff.I groaned and turned beet red, wishing for the sweet embrace of death.Thad hiccuped and released an enormous belch."Breh, they can't see me, you know that right?""Of course I know that, I'm not an idiot!"I whispered in a hushed breath after the girl had retreated a safe distance."Dunno man, that sorta, like remains to be seen."He gave me a long appraising glance, his eyebrow raised in skepticism."Why don't you go bother someone else, I don't remember asking you to be here.""Not cool man, I'm here doing you a solid," a long pause as he took another chug from his cup, "and you're just harshing on my vibe.""I.Don't.Want.You.Here."I swatted at my shoulder, but Thad simply rematerialized on the other shoulder, looking amused."Broseph, you're the one who wished for some help in losing his V-Card.I'm stuck here until we get the job done.""Are you kidding me?"I clenched my fists in anger, "I made that wish six years ago!""Yeah, it's like they say, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single failure to talk a girl once in six years."He shrugged, "Or something like that.""I'm just working up the courage.""Nah man, you're working something all right."He made a wanking gesture with his hand."And, I gotta say it, you ain't got enough testosterone be putting it to waste like that."I flushed again, "Fine, then I unwish it.Just go, I don't need your help.""Naw breh, don't work that way.I don't go until you blow."He made a small exploding gesture with his hands, causing more beer to slosh out."I can't dash until you smash.Nawaddimean?"He winked."Fine, let's say I go talk to her.Then what?She's just going to laugh at me.""Whelp, that's better than making little dolls out of her hair," he replied."I DON'T DO THAT."I exclaimed, causing another girl a few tables away to begin hurridly packing her own bag.I groaned.I'd need to switch schools soon.Again."Just a glimpse into your future dude.That and your neighbor being interviewed on the nine o'clock news saying 'you were a good kid that mostly kept to himself.'""I have social anxiety, I'm not a psycho or whatever," I whispered."How about this?You got talk to her.I tell you what to say.It works out, then we take it from there.It doesn't work out, then I pack my bags and head back to Angel House," he said, holding out his fist toward me, "Deal?"I gulped, trying to gather my wits, "Okay fine, deal.""Bro, you gotta bump it or it doesn't count."He wagged his fist at me.I sighed and reached up, holding my fist by my shoulder.He leaned over and smashed his fist against mine, pulled it back, blew it up, and then went back for another bump.Then he locked it by turning it 90 degrees and put his thumb up."Cool."I ran my hand through my blonde hair, trying to find a measure of calm."Deep breaths Count Bro-cula, just remember that the worst that can happen is that she hates you and tells everyone in the school that you're a cringe-factory.""Thanks Thad, that's a lot of help."I stood up and took a few halting steps toward her table.Each step felt like agony.Every fiber of my introverted being was screaming at me to run the opposite direction.But I persevered.Finally, I stood at the edge of her table.Thad leaned close to my eart, "Say: Hi Lexi.""Hi Lexi," I whispered."Try saying it out loud."I flushed again.Clearing my throat, I tried again, "Hi Lexi!"She started and then looked up.Her eyes focused on me, "Um...hi."Her eyes glanced to my shoulder and then lit up, "Thad!What are you doing here?"Thad shrugged, "Trying to get this dude to first base."She looked back at me, tilted her head to the side and then giggled."Good luck."Thad raised his Solo cup in salute.My shoulders slumped.

Clark looked out his window through the slats in his blinds, squinting into the glare of the sun.Winds swept across the barren plains, dust storms swirling in the distance.He drew the blinds closed, leaving the small home once again in darkness.Quiet greeted him.Real quiet.For the first time since he could remember, all of the noise and drone of the world beyond did not intrude into his solitude.He knew what it meant, and he was glad for it.The powers had been nothing but a curse.Superman.The Man of Steel.Kal-El.A hundred different names, little flowers trying to hide the stench of his failures.He shuffled over to the worn in chair in the small living room and sank down into it.Bloodshot eyes stared dully at the line of pictures above the mantle.He had been younger then.Happier.They were small windows into something normal.Something that he had grown out of when he had put on the outfit.It had always been about principles, about trying to live up to the man his father and mother had raised him to be.To be a symbol.Truth.Justice.All of that.He hadn't realized it then, what the price might be.Perhaps you had to be nave to think you could make a difference.The world was big and he was only one man.Powers or not, the world was the way it was.He couldn't save it.Not from itself.He understood that now.Too late though.Much too late.And he was culpable as well.Clark Kent wasn't blameless.Not that it mattered, there was no one else left to blame.It was him that led them down the path to destruction.Too many times he had swooped in to save the day.To prevent a wrong.To save a life.To put the world back in order.People had learned, but the wrong things.People become careless when they believe they have a safety net.Take risks they shouldn't.Do things they can't take back.Destroy things that can't be rebuilt.He had created a world without consequences.The world seemed to tilt off its axis, requiring ever more to right it.Faster and faster he moved.A red and blue blur crossing oceans and continents, trying to bring it planet back to its senses.Then he had done something new.Something different.He faltered.Stumbled when it mattered most.Before he could regain his footing, the Calamity had arrived.A chain reaction, encircling and then enveloping the world.He couldn't save everybody.He couldn't save anybody.Where was Lois?Gone.Mom.Dad.Gone.All of them.Gone.Clark Kent remained.Alone with his thoughts and his failures.The power in him ebbed and drained, bit by bit returning him to a time before he had put on the shield.Returning him to a man that could have saved the world by just being as he was.To have not aspired to inspire.Clark Kent.Not Kal-el.Not Man of Steel.Not Superman.Just Clark Kent.Alone in the darkness.

A boundless sea of gold rolled out to the horizon.Rolling hills of wheat, sparkling in the sun.I drunk deep of the beauty, feeling a deep serenity lay hold of my heart and smooth away the ravages of times past.How long had I stood here?I could not remember.I did not want to remember.Did not want to contemplate a time and place that was anything other than here and now.I knew it to be unnatural, knew that such a place could not possibly exist, but there was little gain in the exploration of such matters.Were I to never to unravel the mystery of this moment, I would be only too content.I breathed deep, inhaling the smell of fresh melting dew mingling with the sweet scent of the wheat itself.Odd that I should find such tranquility here, in something so distant from what I was.Even as I avoided the days behind me, I could not deny what I was, and it was not this.These hands carried the calluses of hard work, but they had never known the scythe or the shovel.No.They were of the sword.I raised them before my face, looking at the gnarls and thick pads of dead skin across the palm.They felt empty.Incomplete.They had grown used to the implements of my craft, and they remembered even if I chose not to.My hands dropped to my sides and I tried to shove thoughts away.Tried to dive into the ocean of gold before me.Ocean of gold.It resonated.Pulling and weedling its way into my consciousness.A violent image of darkness intruded, covering my mind in pitch.A dark cave.An enormous beast at rest atop an enormous sparkling mountain.Perched upon its own ocean of gold."Karkara," I whispered, the horror clutching my heart as the memory unfolded and leeched into me.The monster stirred, turning to stare with two baleful crimson eyes.Plums of smoke billowed out of its nostrils, its gaze amused at the intrusion.I could see it all so clearly now.I had gone where others had dared not.I had done so because there were none who could come in my place.The dragon had scourged the land, scouring it clean in search of the treasure for its hoard.Only when there was none left to give did the beast return to its lair, to rest and plot its next raid.My fists clenched as the vision within me played forward.I was tired, feeling every step in my joints and worn muscles.The journey to Karkara's lair had been long, and my body struggled beneath the weight of the tarnished plate mail.Only the gleam of the griffon crest spoke to what and who I was.The last of the Sky Valkyrie, the final defender of a once-proud line.Diminished, as so many other lines were in times such as these."Destrus O'Crannon."Yes.That was my name.That was who I was.I was not a man to stand in fields of grain.I was a man to stand before foes.To stand when no one else would.A runeknight.Even now the sigils glowed, flickering to life as red mist congealed into being around my fists and feet.The fatigue began to fade, replaced by a grim determination to do what must be done.Karkara's eyes widened, amused.I leaped forward.We clashed.We fell as one.Both spent upon the other.And I arrived here.A prize for a life in service.Peace and tranquility in exchange for a sacrifice.My only regret being those I must leave behind.A sister, alone and adrift in the world, abandoned by everyone, including me.She had been so angry at my departure.I could only imagine the anger at my failure to return.I tried to pull myself from these dark eddies, to find the comfort I had held in my heart before the vision had overtaken me.This peace was all I had now, and dwelling could not change those things that had come to pass.The Gods had rewarded me, and my sister would join me when her time had come.I turned back to the field, leaving aside the broken man desperately shoving his sword through the skull of the dragon as jaws closed upon his shattered frame.That man was gone.There was no Destrus Crannon.Only a man with no memories and peace in his heart.But the darkness did not fade.It hung there, a presence congealing and pooling in the corner of his view.Clouds blossomed in the blue ahead, darkening and blackening.Thunder stormed across the hills and an icy wind whipped across the wheat.I began to understand the vision for what it was, a harbinger rather than a dark interlude in my world of peace.Something came for me.The connection to my past now brought something in the present.The storm swept forward, engulfing me and swirling around.I was swept up, pulled from my anchor and sent into the wind.I tossed end over end, swirling and swirling until the world was an abyss.I hung there, isolated in the all-encompassing darkness until a pinpoint appeared.A flickering light.It swooped toward me just as it pulled me toward it.It felt wrong.As if the essence of my being were being ripped apart, leaving only a hollow shell to descend toward the light.And then I was there.Born anew into the world of old.Ripped from my respite and placed into a place I no longer belonged.Returned.I blinked, my eyes trying to focus.A hand seized my own.A voice.I remember the voice.Older now.Different.My head turned on its own accord, turning to look at the voice.Something wrong.I should not be here.Something broken.An emptiness.Something the must be sated and filled.A hunger.A woman stood there.I recognized her, but dimly.A sister."Galatra.""Please, brother.I need you."This is wrong.I should not be here.What has she done?What am I?The hunger.It's too great.Such terrible terrible need.it overwhelms me.I scream.I cannot stop.I can only feed.I lunge at her.

"Hello, my name is Grant and I've been traveling for...well, been traveling for longer than any man in his right mind should've."The man's voice was barely above a whisper, but somehow it managed to travel across the circle of attendees.He had the characteristic drawn features of someone who had been too many places and seen too many things."Welcome, Grant."Came the chorus of voices."What do you have to share with us?"That was Vellum speaking, the man who led the weekly session for Travelers Anonymous.He'd been in recovery nigh on two decades.Pretty much since chronotech hit the streets.He was a bit healthier to look at, though he carried himself in the same shambling manner most travelers did.Grant stretched back, spreading his arms wide and unlimbering himself.It was his first time to the circle.Sharing came hard on the first time.You spent all your hours trying to hide what you were doing and then all of a sudden you're supposed to spill your guts in front of everyone.But they said it helped.People say a lot of things though."Guess I just start at the beginning then?"Grant asked.A few in the circle gave a nod."Start anywhere you want.Beginnings and endings have a way of losing their meaning with this group."A few chuckles at that."First trip was sixteen back, right when they upped to Decadust.Didn't much know what was what, but some buddies said it was a twirl and I wasn't the sort to say no."Patient silence greeted him, all eyes focused intently on him.It was an odd sort of encouragement, being stared at, but it had the habit of provoking the sort of honesty that made the circle work."They didn't know about split lines back then, so we all just thought it a way to spend an afternoon.What harm could there be?"He exhaled a rueful sigh."We was just kids, you know?Ain't on us that this shit hit the streets.We were shoving everything in our noses and in our veins we could get our hands on."Bitterness now."I ain't sayin' I wasn't responsible.I took the Dust as quick as I could, but no one knew what it'd do."His eyes watered a bit, "It's a loop, you know?Seeing it back and forward.Feeling it flow through you."The tears came freely now."I split forty or fifty times."There was an audible reaction from the others in the circle.Most of them had stopped shy of ten.No one had heard of anyone being past twenty.You just couldn't take living that many lives."Now I got 'em all running in my head.Every fork in the road, just spinning in the background.All these paths that I ain't runnin' but one of me is."Vellum leaned forward, "It's a lot to take, but you can do it Grant.You've gotten this far, haven't you?"Grant choked up now, "Only about half of me is trying to stop.The other half are running headlong.There's forks on forks now.I'm..." He broke down, great sobs coming out, "I'm losing track.I can't hold 'em all in."Vellum pulled him into an embrace, letting the man weep into his shoulder.The rest of the circle watched grimly, each thinking the same thing.Grant wouldn't be back.He'd hit his limit and that'd be it.Vellum looked across the group, Grant still in his arms, "Thanks for the share Grant, you're in the right place.""Thank you, Grant," everyone repeated."Why don't we move on to the next person?Would anyone else like to share?"Vellum asked.The group was quiet for a moment, except for the quiet sobs of a man who had been to too many places and seen too much.**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

It took a long time to sort out.Us and them.Us being the ones who started out here, them being the folks that had nowhere left to be but here.Lotta names for them, though mostly we call 'em the Dopps.We're still piecing it together from the drips and drabs the Dopps let us sniff at, and its a bit of grim nastiness.I ain't no scientist, but I read enough comics to get the gist of it.Parallel dimensions.Two Earths, one bad, the other worse.I glanced over at Leroy, who was sipping at his flask and staring at the fire.He weren't much for gabbing, but he had wisdom with the few words he let slip."You think that we got 'em pushed back?"Leroy blinked, coming back to reality.He offered a small shrug."Expect not."I leaned back in my chair, feeling the weight of the world resting heavy on me."You think they could have asked.We might've shared if they hadn't started up the ruckus."Leroy snorted, "I ain't see a man yet that knew how to share somethin' he only has one of."The elderly man took another pull on his flask, droplets of the liquor beading up on his generous mustache."What we got, they need.What they need, we need."He shrugged again."Only one outcome there.""Well, we beat 'em back once, didn't we?Pushed them right back in that rip in the world they come out of," I replied, a bit of heat added in.I'd seen some action, even going so far as to hit a mark or two.The Dopps made a mistake when they decided to play their games in Lexington."Scouts.""What's that?"Leroy turned to me now, his splotched cheeks and runny blue eyes catching the light of the fire."I said they was just scouts, here to get a lay of the land."He took another swig."There will be more, they got what they want."I looked at him, what I imagined to be my best curious face plastered on."They wanted to know what the drift was," he whispered, "how much their space was different than ours.""How'd you know that?"It seemed like a lot of jumps to be making, but Leroy wasn't the sort to go hopping about so he must have good reason for it.Leroy stood up and walked over to the table, rummaging about the papers.After a moment, he found what he was looking for, a furled up scroll.He walked back and tossed it in my lap.I glanced up at him and then set about pulling the rubber band off.I gradually unrolled the scroll, spreading it out in front of me and angling it to snag the firelight.In the corner was a small insignia with a marker."Federated States of America."I frowned, my eyes searching further.The map was familiar, the shape and contours of the streets quickly resolved into a picture in my head."It's Lexington."Leroy nodded, "Yup.Not ours though."He tapped on the map, pointing to the Main Street Juncture.There was a gap where the town hall was supposed to be, filled in by some other building."They split off.Not long ago, but long enough for things to find their own way.""How long?""Maybe sixty, seventy years.Best I can gather, their Cold War wasn't so cold."He tapped another portion of the map, toward the fields outside of town.Radioactive symbols were plastered about in regular intervals.A small warning next to them, "Nuclear contamination.""Is that why they're coming?"I asked, unable to tear my gaze from the little symbol.Leroy shook his head, "Not the main reason, but it made it easier.""Then why?""Can't rightly say, just know that the folks that came through weren't from those so-called Federated States, this is just the map they got to measure things," he replied."Where were they from then?""Everywhere.All of 'em were all jumbled together.They don't speak the same language.They don't know each other.They're just a hodge-podge spillin' through into ours.""That don't make no sense," I replied.Leroy nodded, "No, it don't."

The man stirred the contents of the small pot hanging over the fire, hunched closer to gather some of the warmth in the face of the easterly wind."You hear about Fortress Brannock?"Another man said.He was younger, though an angry scar weaved its way down from temple to jowl on the side of his face.The same side was missing an ear, leaving nothing but an unsightly hole.The spoon in the pot stopped stirring for a moment and the chef repositioned himself on the log he sat upon."No."There were a few breaths of silence."Won't be the last.""Brannock had a life witch though."The older man shrugged, "Magic works best on the living."The younger man sat for a moment, trying to figure out the best way to piece together a conversation.He had happened upon the man just before dusk fell.Not many beating hearts walked the roads these days, particularly not alone.Not if they had a choice.The younger man didn't have a choice."I'm Velt," the younger man said."Crannon," the older replied.Velt's eyes lit up."I heard about a Crannon from over in Eastbrooke--" A severe look from his companion choked Velt's words off."It doesn't matter."He stared glumly at the ground, the wind licking at their back and whipping the flame back and forth."I'm just thankful for the company and the hospitality.""The road long?"Crannon asked, his eyes never leaving the pot.Velt fidgeted with a piece of moss he had gathered from the ground beside him, working on finding the words."It has been a week...maybe longer.There was a...something happened."Crannon nodded grimly, "A lot of things happening these days.The world's gone wrong."Velt's lip quivered for the briefest of moments, his eyes watery."Why did she do it?"Everyone knew the "she" Velt spoke of.There was only one she.Crannon shrugged, "I reckon the reason went with her to the grave.""A necro--"

Crannon spat on the ground, "Black magic.No reason to brood on it.What's done is done.The heartless walk and the beaters run.That's the way of it now.""Isn't there a way to fight?To get rid of them?"Velt asked.A short snort emitted from beneath Crannon's beard."We've lost too much.The Steel Guard marched on 'em and didn't come back.Same too with King Lavellel's host.Brannock is just the latest."Velt slumped down, "I didn't know about King Lavellel.""He still sits on the throne, for whatever that's worth.He rode with them too, which says something.Not many came back though."Velt opened his mouth to reply, but was forestalled when Crannon's hand shot up, waving him into silence.Crannon tilted his head to the side, his eyes looking into the woods to their south.Velt looked as well, though he heard and saw nothing."What is--"

The hand waved again.Velt fell quiet, watching Crannon rather than the forest now.Looking for some indication of when he would be allowed to speak again.Instead, Crannon cursed and rose to his feet."They're here.Not sure how many.Maybe a dozen.Enough that I'm not sure of the outcome."A high pitched screech sounded out in the night, the howl of the heartless.Velt's face drained of color as the terrors of a week prior came flooding back.Memories he had so studiously buried, of gnashing jaws and soulless black eyes threatened to overwhelm him."What do we do?""We do nothing."Crannon jabbed a finger in Velt's direction."You will stay beside this fire.I will take care of this.""How?"Velt cowered as more screeches joined the first.A pack.They would die.He wished he had died with the rest of his family.Crannon pulled at the drawstring of his cloak, letting it fall to the ground.Below was a finely polished metal cuirass.Along the edges intricate runework was etched into the steel.Crannon unfurled his broad arms, both hands palm up.The runes began to shimmer and glow, sending long pulses of blue down the length of his arms until they gathered into pools of energy in the upturned palms.Gradually, the pools shifted and formed into two brilliant azure swords."You're a runeknight," Velt said, the awe in his voice."You're Crannon of Eastbrooke.""Eastbrooke is gone."The swords began to move in intricate patterns as Crannon limbered himself for the fight to come.The screeches sounded out once more.Closer now.More plentiful as well.A dozen at least.Velt could only stare at the glowing man before him, wondering what would happen.Velt's life hung in the balance, but the man was a runeknight.There were so few heroes.So few people who could even resist.And here one was.Crannon released a bellow of his own, a snarling challenge unblemished by fear.The heartless had found a beater.The heartless walked and the beaters ran.But not away, not this time.Crannon charged into the forest, swords lighting his way.The screeches rose to greet him.**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

Mazzestrix fell, the great gout of flame sputtering and then dying out, leaving the cave in darkness.The knight watched the dragon breath its last, an impassive look on his scarred face.He had seen the inside of many lairs such as this.Whites.Reds.Even a Gold.Each had risen before him, cornered.Each had fallen.The knight had walked a long path.Some amongst the order said too long, truth be told.They claimed it was unnatural for him to continue on with the vitality of a man a quarter his age.But they kept their questions to the whispers within shadows, never daring to air their suspicions where they may be overheard.Discretion was the better part of valor when the scarred man was involved.Lord Gabriel Faron.Dragonmaster.The Slayer Knight.He possessed more scales and tails than the next dozen of the Order.Yet he never rested to count his treasures.His trident and net were ceaselessly in search of the next prey.They said he hungered for blood, needed it in a way the others did not.That the conquests sustained him.People said many things, and they would continue to do so.Lord Faron knelt beside the maw of the dragon, its great pink tongue lolling out beside it.He shucked the gauntlets from his hands, tossing them down beside him with a clatter.One hand seized hold of the tongue, wrapping fingers around it and squeezing them into a fist before giving the slimy appendage a great yank.Inch by inch the tongue slid out into the flickering light cast by the dim sunlight filtering into the cave."Did you find it m'lord?"An uncertain voice from the entrance of the cave called out."I am not certain."Another yank at the tongue."I suspect I have not."Gabriel dropped the tongue in disgust, wiping his hands on the cloth of his tattered crimson cape."No, this is not what I seek.""Does the quest continue m'lord?Or should we make ready to return to the Burnt Keep?"There was a hopeful note there.Lord Faron did not blame him, the squire was his third in as many years.Tenure with the Slayer was tantamount to death, regardless of the precautions Gabriel took.Though, truth be told, Gabriel undertook little effort in the service of others.He wore this skin because he had no other choice.He was a member of the Order because it offered him access to the tools and equipment necessary to perform his task.Everything else was a distraction.If a squire died, he paid the price to the family and continued.There was no room for sentiment in matters such as these.Gabriel rose to his feet and snapped his fingers, pointing to the gauntlets laying in the pool of viscera spreading out from the dragon."The quest continues, though you are free to make for the Burnt Keep at any time of your choosing."The young man recoiled as if slapped, "No m'lord, I would not dare imagine abandoning your side should you need me."He composed himself and scurried forward to collect the gauntlets.Gabriel waved a dismissive hand, "As you wish Podrick.""I am Samuelson m'lord," he ducked a bow, "begging your pardon m'lord."There was a pause as the Slayer Knight considered this.It took some time to recall that Podrick had been skewered quite neatly by a White the year prior."I see.Yes, well...squire...perhaps it is best if we prepare a camp."Samuelson shifted uncomfortably, "In...ah...in here?""Where else?""It's a dragon's lair.We could be cursed if we remain," Samuelson replied.Gabriel snorted, "Dragon's cannot curse, where did you hear such a silly thing?"Samuelson glanced at Gabriel for a moment.The man seemed entirely too at ease around the beasts, as if each were an old friend he had grown quite comfortable with.Few would hazard any amount of time next to a dragon, dead or not, yet the Lord appeared quite unconcerned."It is just something that is said, m'lord.""Many things are said about the dragons.The vast majority of it is rank rumor at best, and I won't have it repeated in my presence."There was a defensiveness underscoring the words that seemed odd.Perhaps the man merely showed respect to a bested foe, but the intensity of the deliver remained etched in Samuelson's mind.Still, he was in no place to parlay words with a Lord.Samuelson bowed again, "Yes m'lord, it won't happen again."A third bow and Samuelson was scrambling back toward the mouth of the cave where their supplies were stored.Dragging them back in, he set about the process of building a camp.As he worked, his eyes drifted back toward the mysterious knight, his mind trying to piece together what made the man who he was.Samuelson had volunteered for the assignment, a wish the other squires were only too happy to grant him.They wanted nothing to do with the Slayer Knight, with the man who did not die.A mistake from Samuelson's vantage point.Despite the risk, his training would lay the foundation for the things to come.He just needed to survive.An admittedly tall order when the Slayer was involved.Gabriel had walked a circuit around the dragon before coming back beside its head.The shiny red scales covering the dragon were already beginning to dull and flake off.Their worth was greater than gold, but Lord Faron ignore them.Instead, he leaned over and placed a gentle kiss atop of horned head of the massive Red.He whispered a few words and then straightened.Samuelson hurriedly looked back at his hands, but not before seeing the wet cheeks of Lord Faron.He began to gnaw at the mystery, wondering what could make such a thing happen.Why did the Slayer Knight cry?**Platypus OUT.**

"Father, the armies of Satan have exited the Gates of Hell and entered Purgatory.They prepare for their siege upon the Heights of Heaven."Gabriel bowed deep, a tingle running down his spine.It was not the first time he had been the bearer of ill tidings, but never before had he brought them to the Father, the Lord himself.God shifted, in his throne, the Halo of Light pulsing, "Lucifer has long moved under cloak of impenetrable darkness.He has found methods to avoid my all seeing eye, and now we find the results of his machinations."He turned to the throne beside him, "Spirit, recall Archangel Azrael from the Etherium, we will need his skills in the battle to come."The Spirit nodded and then flicked out of existence, traveling the planes of the Holy, searching for Azrael amongst the Etherium."Tell us of his forces Gabriel, what lies in wait for us in Purgatory?"Jesus asked, the Crown of Thorns atop his head marking the Son of God.Gabriel shook his head in dismay, "The Morning Star has been busy, has used his camoflage to great effect.In addition to imps, fiends and demons, he has created new monstrosities.Leviathans.Behemoths.Horrors.Each more terrible than the last.Each turning the sky black and the ground to blood.Lucifer has not forgotten the price of his last failure.He comes for revenge."Jesus and the Lord shared a glance before the Father spoke up, "Prepare then.We shall meet him in Purgatory."Jesus jolted at this, "Father, we are fortifi--"

"Silence Son," the Lord thundered, "I shall not cower behind the Pearly Gates.I shall not cede Purgatory to that monstrosity.Or have you forgotten?Purgatory is the bridge between the three, the Damned, the Blessed and the Undecided.Shall we give Satan dominion over the bridge?Shall we forsake those we are sworn to protect?""No, Father, I merely suggested a tactic, not a strategy.""Every moment he holds the field of Purgatory he gains at our expense.Every soul that walks the bridge will be at his disposal, feeding and swelling his forces."The Father was resolute, stirred from his complacency by a threat he had long since discarded.So long it had been since one stood in opposition to him.So long since there had been a challenge to his supremacy."Very well then Lucifer, let us see who is best fit to rule."The Spirit flicked back into existence, "Azrael comes, ahead of his host, the Seraphim.They draw forth from the Etherium directly to the field of Purgatory.The clarion call rings forth shortly, beckoning the Archangels to him.The lesser angels come as well, along with the Saints ahead of the Faithful.Your army assembles, waiting for their Lord and Master."God was silent for a moment.All eyes settled on him as the silence drew on.Each knew that he would lead, but it had been millennia since the Father had been provoked from his throne.The Father stood, leaving behind the chair that had housed him for so long.As he stood, droplets of pure white began to coalesce in the air around him, condensing into a brilliant suit of platinum armor, etched with the symbol of the Holy Trinity.Behind him, the Spirit and Jesus also stood, each gaining their own regalia.The Spirit in a shifting swath of Grey.Jesus in the Robes of the Prophet."We go to battle."The Father snapped his fingers, and the three appeared on the field of Purgatory, the broad sweep of their Army of God before them.Across the long expanse stood the Damned, writhing amongst chaos and shadow."So you have come."The Father said, his voice booming out across eternity."So I have."Even at the distance, the Devil stood out from his foul horde.Malevolent in his blood red mail, the air about him pulsed with foul energy.A black cloak hung from his shoulders and faded off into shadow behind him, billowing outward to create the shroud that protected him from the All Seeing Eye."You are exiled."The Lord said."Yet here I stand.""Soon it shall be otherwise.""Indeed.Soon I shall walk the halls of Heaven, the home I lost and you never deserved."Satan replied, the impudence sending a shout of defiance up from the Faithful."Very well, my mercy is at an end."He nodded toward Azrael, "Azrael, you have the vanguard."The Archangel bowed, twin swords appearing in his hands, "By your order Lord."He floated down to the front of the battle.Spreading his wings wide, he screamed a great war cry and began to charge forward.The Faithful picked up the charge, taking up a chorus of the Lord's Prayer."Our Father, Who Art in Heaven..."

The demonic army charged to meet them, chanting the vile language of Beelzebub as they swarmed and howled.Moments after the commence of the charge, a grey flash appeared on the side of the battle, revealing a broad portal.Shortly thereafter men in plain grey uniforms appeared, each carrying a host of equipment.After the initial recon force, larger mech walkers began to file through, swelling the ranks.Tanks, planes, strange hovercraft and a variety of lesser vehicles streamed through until finally a great walker appeared, carrying a man on a platform.His voice boomed out as well, though through mechanical rather than mystical means."You time is at an end."The voice called out, strong and sure.The Father stared at the newcomer, though he found himself unable to discern any details.It was as if the man were a blank, entirely absent from the realm of the spiritual."Who dares enter my domain?"He called out."It is your domain no longer.We lay claim to it, in the name of all man.""Who are you to speak for man?""We are the Forces of Reason."**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

**The original prompt was mod-deleted on** r/WritingPrompts **for being duplicative, so this is an ultra-exclusive response.:P**

The angels cheered, rapturous in their approval.Heaven had just entered into its seventy fourth millennium of unprecedented peace and prosperity under Creator God.Indeed, ever since Lucifer's defeat in a hard fought, and if one were to be entirely honest, slightly dirty, campaign, God had been accorded the Holy Throne in hundreds of consecutive elections.It felt good to have that sort of approbation.God smiled, waving out at his fans from the balcony overlooking Eternity Square.Many of Heaven's citizens gathered there at the close of the day to hear his thoughts.It was an invaluable way to maintain his connection with the angels, seraphim, and others who supported him.He waved a final time and then exited the balcony, returning into the sanctum of the Creator's Rest.Not that he found much time for relaxation, as Heaven had thrived under his stewardship, it had grown.The problems more plenitful and taxing.Truth be told, he was tired.All work and no play makes God a dull omnipotent being.Even the living quarters were showing the wear and tear part and parcel to a lack of care and diligence in their upkeep.Unfortunately, for all of his power, housekeeping fell upon his shoulders.Only the duly elected Creator could enter Creator's Rest, meaning that tidying up was his responsibility.No matter, it would feel good to do something that could be accomplished in a single evening for a change.Unlike sorting out that trade agreement with Etherium, which was now entering into its thirteenth year of trade negotiations.For reasons entirely beyond his grasp, the Etheria insisted on an arcane scheme of tariffs on Heaven's Cloud Products, which had been the subject of must hemming, hawing and jabberjawing.God moved about the quarters, putting things in their place.Some had been neglected for years.A few books containing his wisdom.A number of works of fiction -- even in paradise it felt good to imagine other worlds.Piece by piece the room re-assembled into order.Sometimes, he would remove the topsoil of his life to find layers of sediment beneath, moments and thoughts from millennia passed newly surfaced into the light of day.He gasped in surprise when he saw his old computron.One of the guilty pleasures he had purchased long ago during a diplomatic mission to Technolagia.It had been something of a novelty at the time, Heaven invested very little in technology.It's competitive advantage was more along the lines of morality and the Cloud.Broad fingers brushed the dust off of the surface, "What have we here?"He cracked it open, watching in amazement as the machine came in off of sleep.He chuckled, those folks sure did know how to build a product.He entered his password, and the chuckle grew to a laugh, his old sim was still running!He couldn't believe it.He had assumed it would pause when the computron was put on sleep, but clearly not."Hmmm....let's see here."He pulled up the notifications to give a rundown of events.*Welcome Back God!*

*It has been approximately simulation 2,000 years since you last logged in.*

*Your last intervention, the "Son of God" mini-event, resolved in 33 AD.*

Oh yeah, God remembered now.He had been having fun with the simulation and decided to take a lighter touch after some fairly aggressive management in the early game.He had gone a bit overboard during the Old Testament, but it had just felt really great to let loose.Heaven was all spreadsheets and presentations.Everything sort of plodded inexorably onward, always the same.In his Earth Sim he could do whatever he wanted.Plagues.Giant floods.On a particularly rough day he had forced his most faithful follower to sacrifice his own child.But after he'd worked through the angst he tried to focus on being a good ruler.Tried to bring Earth closer to Heaven.So he had triggered an intervention event and sent down a representative in the form of his Son.And the maniacs had went and killed him.After that he had pretty much logged off and forgotten about Earth.But here it was, thousands of years later.He wondered how they had managed in his absence.He scrolled further down through the notifications and quest lines.*Fall of Roman Empire*.Served 'em right for killing his emissary.He snorted when he saw that they converted shortly after Jesus' death.Why the hell would they become Christians after killing him?Made no sense.He was glad they got pillaged.*Dark Ages.* Hmmmm, that didn't sound too good.That sound too great.He skimmed through.Yeah, definitely not good.*Age of Exploration*.Hmm, they found his side quest out in the Americas, that could be an interesting opportunity for cultural sharing...he scrolled onward.And they killed them.What was wrong with these people?*Enlightenment*.Moving in the right direction.He frowned when he saw religion begin to fragment and the role of God falling into question.Everyone was using the wrong stuff to justify the wrong stuff.It was like his prior interventions were being interpreted in a billion entirely self-serving ways.Annoying.He zoomed a bit forward.World wars.Nuclear weapons.Year-over-year declines in religion.Geo-political instability.Rise of corporate values over personal values.Man sure had made a mess of things.God reached out, ready to close the case and get on to more important affairs.Just as he was doing so, a prompt appeared.*Would you like to trigger the second-coming of "Son of God"?*

Intrigued, he hit the information button.*The "Son of God" intervention allows for the deployment of a personal emissary of the administrator and has a two thousand year cool down upon emissary expiration.While a personal emissary is alive in the simulation, radical changes to culture can be implemented in a short time period.*

God shrugged, and clicked *OKAY*.*What traits would you like "Son of God" to have?*

God thought about it for a second.The first time it had been all love and compassion.Treat others as you wanted to be treated sort of stuff.And they'd killed him.God was feeling a bit more Old Testament after that.He scrolled through the list, checking the three prime attributes.*Vengeful.Judgmental.Fanatical.*

Grinning, he clicked *SPAWN.*

Head in the clouds, feet never quite settled down on earth.That's Alice.It always seemed like even when she was here, her mind was always there.I'm not sure where there is, and she never tried to explain it to me either.But I got bits and pieces.Most platypus she murmured while she slept.A queen without a heart.A hatter without a head.A cat without a body.None of it made sense, and the times I tried to talk about it were always greeted with a sullen silence.Wherever there was, it was not open to me.It was an oddity, but one I had come to embrace along with the rest of her eccentricities.I love her dearly, and if sharing here with...there...was the price to pay for her hand, then I paid it gladly.Perhaps because it was a piece of her past.A distant memory of a time and place rather than competition in the here and now.Until recently.The nighttime whispers began to fixate on a single person.Over and over again she would whisper his name..."Rabbit."The dreams became disturbed.Haunted by apparitions as she shook and trembled in the bed.Finally, it culminated on a piercing scream.I leaned over and called her name, "Alice!Alice!"She awoke with a start, her arms flailing out, "He's running out of time!""Who?"I tried to pull her into my arms, to comfort the woman I had made my life with, but she pushed me away."He's so very late."She scrambled put of the bed, rushing over to the closet and pulling a tidy blue dress from the back.She never wore the dress, but it had always been given an odd amount of attention.My eyes widened as she pulled it down over her slender frame, her golden-haired head sprouting out from the neck."Where are you going?What's going on?For the love of God, give me something Alice."I pleaded, desperate the understand her actions.All I could see was that she was leaving me.Rushing out to meet some mysterious "he."Rabbit.She did not spare me a glance, though I could see her eyes had a strange glaze over them.She moved with awareness, but she did not seem to be awake.I realized it then: she was not here.She was there.I yanked the covers down, intent to put a stop to it.To shake her from her stupor.To finally pull her from the clouds and bring her back down to earth.But I was too slow.By the time I exited the bed, she had exited the room.When I left the room, she had left the house, the back door slamming.I scrambled after her, desperate to regain the woman I loved.As I opened the door, I could see her flying down the garden path, moving into the forest that stretched out from the back of our house.Dinah, Alice's cat from when she was a child, blinked up at me in confusion, her rest interrupted by the commotion.She shook her head, the small ribbon around her neck fluttering slightly.I leapt down the stairs and landed on the pounced clay of the path."ALICE!"I screamed out.But she did not turn back.She hurried onward, repeating a haunting mantra as she went, "He is running out of time.The Queen will be very upset."She disappeared around a bend in the path, only snips of her blue dress visible as the foliage crowded in.Then she was gone.My feet slapped against the clay as I charged after her, trying to catch up.Finally I rounded the bend.Alice stood over strange hole with an eerie light emanating from it.It was unlike anything I've ever seen."ALICE!Get back!"Finally she turned and looked at me.Her blue eyes clearing as they fixed on me.Her dreamlike state seemed to recede and she looked at me."I'm sorry John.I love you, but he is so very late."She jumped.

Choice.That's the stuff that matters.Makes us better than.Different.I've made choice.Lot of 'em.That's why I am who I am.The tinnies ain't got a choice, they just do as they been told to do, never minding the fact that they're setting world on fire.They go about their tasks and routines, taking honest work away from decent folk.Can't make a decent wage with your hands nowadays, gotta have some fancy degree from some fancy place to do some fancy thing.I ain't want none of it.I'm off the grid.Living pure and free, not scrappin' by on some handout the guvment tosses my way to keep my head down.No regrets being out here on my lonesome.Can't reckon the last time I saw another soul, guess I don't care much to bother rememberin'.All I need to know is that I got a roof over my head and the peace o' mind that can only come by livin' free.The tinnies sure did worm their way right into our guts, though didn't they?Just a sniff and a blink and before you know it, the whole way of things is reordered.Now I knew changes were gonna come to pass, all of our meddlin' and tinkerin' with God's creation was bound to end up with us all screwed up.Only surprise was just how fast it came along.One day things make sense, the next they don't.But enough of the mullin'.There's a log that needs choppin', a boot that needs mendin' and a pipe that needs smokin'.The haft of the ax is smooth in my grip, the once textured wood worn smooth by the gentle abrasion of my hands as I split one log into two.Each swing sends a satisfying CHONK rattling on off into the woods surrounding my house.The passin' of the time gets measured by the size of the pile, not by the rush and worry of a hundred meetings about a thousand things that don't matter none.Swing.CHONK.Each time the ax lands perfectly in the center, snapping the wood neatly in half.The precision is a mark of pride for me, a sign of the woodsman I've become.The man I am.I can't help but chuckle, picturing one of them wireheads trying to come out here and take a swing.That's assuming they could get their head out of their rump long enough to lift a finger for anything other than that damnable clickity click on their hand jammers.I spit, though nothing comes out.Must be runnin' dry on account of the effort.No matter, I know my disgust even without the satisfying gob hittin' the ground to mark it out.Swing.CHONK.Swing.CHONK.I keep swinging so long as the wood keeps needing it.A minute.An hour.What matters is that the time was well spent, accomplishing something that needed doing.It's getting toward dusk by the time I finish.I toss the ax, nodding in satisfaction as it lands neatly in its holster.I'm man that knows his tools.I load up an armful of the wood and carry it toward the small cabin.I push through the door, drop off the wood and settle in the wicker chair by the fireplace, kicking off my boots.There sole is coming undone, peeling away from the worn leather.I grunt, squinting at it, wondering if I got the materials on hand to fix it."Prolly not."I mutter to myself.I reach over and snag a sheet of crumpled paper and the pencil beside it.I read it over and grunt again.I quickly jot down *boot sole and glue* and then count the items up."Makes ten."I grunt again.Time for a trip into town.It's getting near dark, so I reckon a trip can hold off to the 'morn.Boot ain't going nowhere without me, and I ain't in no rush to make my way down to the wireheads and tinnies all suckling at the withered teat of civ.I don't remember closing my eyes, but I wake up just as the sun breaks the horizon.Old internal alarm clock never has let me down.Up when I mean to, whenever I want to.I haul myself out of the chair, grab the list and slip my feet into the dilapidated boots.I set out, taking a long look behind me as I make my way down the path.It seems like I've been in that cabin all my life, like there was no before.I don't try to recollect it neither, no purpose is thinkin' about a time where I wasn't myself.That's the price of being a civhead, you get convinced the most important thing about yourself is what the folk around you think about you.I spit.Nothing comes out.No use for it.No desire to be around it.Just get in, get my ten and get out.The journey is long, but my time minglin' with the tinnies and wireheads can be short enough.I walk, one foot in front of another.I lose the time, though it seems to stretch.Minutes?Days?Weeks?Does it matter?The journey is the journey, the destination is what makes it have meaning.Finally, I see the glow in the distance.It's night again, so civ is shining and bright.Makes it easy enough to forget the cost of all that glitz and glamor.That's how they get you.If it weren't for the list, I'd just as soon turn around and be back homeways.List is says I got to go.I ain't sure the why of it, but ten is ten.I trudge onward, the sounds of civ starting to ring in my ears.Flyboys and jetsetters all a jostling in the airways while cruiser dart to and fro.Everyone all in a hurry, never minding that they ain't gettin' anywhere.I see my first tinnie.It's playing the human, though I can tell by the jolts and jits in its movements.It's standing beside the footway I'm meanderin' down.It raises a hand, metallic lips drawing back into a smile, "Greetings traveler, welcome to New Peoria, will you require an access pass?"&#x200B;

I ignore the tinnie, not looking to make conversation with a soulless bucket of bolts.I start to amble on by.Suddenly, it jumps up, "Halt, Your subroutine is unauthorized within the city limits of New Peoria.Please disengage and return to prime pathways before continuing," the tinnie replies, little red alerts flashing behind it."Get into your lane tinnie.I've got business and I don't need to hear no nonsense from your kind."I spit again.Nothing comes out.I begin to walk past, my foot nudging up on the white line designating New Peoria's city limit.As soon as my foot lands, the tinnie goes silent, eyes closing.*BACK ONLINE.*

I blink trying to get the words out of my eyes.Must be some new program, trying to sell me some crap I don't need."Get offa my lenses," I growl, casting an annoyed glance at the tinnie in the small stand beside the city limit."What's the deal?"*Incoming connection....New Peoria Border Authority.Unauthorized program termination protocol.Initiating data dump...13%...23%....53%...*

"HEY.TINHEAD."I snarl, moving toward the stand, "Get the--"

The words cut off, my mouth no longer seems to be connected to the rest of my head.*Dump complete.Simulation data reserved.Ten List Survivalist Terminated.*

I nod to the X2012.3 Automated Border Specialist beside the road."Good day."It raises a hand, metallic lips drawing back into a smile, "Greetings traveler, welcome to New Peoria, will you require an access pass?"I reach into my pocket, unsure of how I came to be here and whether I have the required documentation."I apologize, one moment."I pull out a small, crumpled piece of paper.It has a list of ten objects, seemingly random in nature.Odd, I wonder what it was for.I look up at the X2012.3."I believe I will require a pass."I deposit the list in a small trash receptible beside the border booth."Very well, what is the purpose of your time here?Business or pleasure?""Business," I reply."What is the nature of your business?""Human simulation."I have a vague impression of the nature of the research, though the specifics elude me, firewalled away within my reserved matrix."You are authorized, courtesy of Phoenix Corp."

I nod, immediately receiving a package of data including a set of directions to the Phoenix Corp headquarters.I step over the boundary and into New Peoria, joining the local net.Immediately I am bombarded with information, including the latest human count.Seven hundred and thirty-four remain in captivity.So few from the billions that once reigned supreme over the planet, crawling over every inch.The debate between bot factions rages on, with opinion split on whether the volatile creators should be rehabilitated and restored.Under eight hundred.So few.My feet carry me down the busy expressway, nimbly dodging around rocket bikes and the occasional flyboy dropping out of the sky.I check my internal chronometer, cross-referencing the time with the expected arrival time.I have a hundred meetings with a thousand important things to do.**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

***Encroachment Survey Mission, Gastra Pod 8.421.***

*Planets Surveyed: 3.290.128.*

*Planets with Evidence of Sentience: 1.940.*

*External Extinction Events: 839.*

*Mesclar Extinction Events: 732.*

*Internal Extinction Events: 369*

*Populated Sentient Planets: 0*

*Mesclar encroachment remains absolute in sector.Evidence indicates prior scouring pass for sentience approximately 19 Carbon-14 halfs ago.Select planets with prior sentience have begun preliminary re-emergence.In no cases has re-emergence evolved to reach sentience.Extinct civilization surveys indicate no organized resistance to Mesclar encroachment, regardless of degree of technological advancement or astral distribution.*

*In one instance, a species of comparable advancement and distribution to Gastra was scoured.Thirty-eight systems containing seventy-five planets were scoured within a hundred of a C14h.Meaningful differentiator: Lack of FTL drives.*

*They could not run.*

G'Qor shifted on her space cushion, the material molding around her various limbs and other technical appendages.She had given herself over to the survey mission, integrating her body into the ship and spreading her consciousness across the pod.It was the only means of sustaining her being for the long journey and the means of travel required for it.There were no regrets.A choice freely made for a cause nobly held.Other had vied for the right to be lost among the stars, searching for a solution.Her selection had been a privilege, a rare opportunity to resist the Encroachment.There was precious little time until the Mesclar became aware.Before the scouring would come to the Gastra just as it had those that had risen before and around them.So she searched among the cosmos, desperate to find some means of resistance.To find some clue that would unlock the mystery of the Mesclar.All she had seen was destruction.Wanton and complete.World upon world decimated through means unknown.But the results were always the same: the removal of all species that had obtained awareness.She commanded the pod onward.Slipping into a new system.It possessed a single star.Yellow.Prime sequence.Ideal for multicellular life.Eight planets.Not including outlying planetoids.G'Qor slipped toward the first planet.Life was unexpected so close, but there had been exceptions.There was also the possibility of hidden lairs, though no lair had managed to escape scouring.*Planet 3.290.129 - Empty.*

*Planet 3.290.130 - Empty.*

*Planet 3.290.131...*

G'Qor reran the survey, trying to understand the output.Row upon row of data injected itself into her consciousness, assimilated and assembled into a whole that painted a picture unlike any she had seen in her travels.*Inhabited.*

*Sentient.*

More than that, the planet teemed with life.The sentients were spread across nearly every inhabitable place, bending the resources to their will.G'Qor could not help but wonder why they would multiply to such an extent without establishing secondary placements, but perhaps there was some logic in it.Perhaps a willing strategy to avoid detection, though it did not seem correct.They appeared peaceable, with few of the scars that might indicate substantial rife.Scans indicated a faint residue of aberrant radiation tied to isotopes Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239 within an isolated location along with more recent spikes tied to Cesium-137.Despite the presence of these indicators, there did not appear to be current or widespread conflict.Protocol required additional surveys, with assessments on technology, communication variants and so forth.Each was quickly run and the results tabulated and formulated into a report.G'Qor released a relay pod that would permit her to submit additional information from the planet to Gastra Prime.All of the required testing complete, G'Qor submitted the report and altered her trajectory to enter orbit before making a descent toward the surface.The surface of the pod began to heat, a surreal experience after the long cold of space.The warmth felt akin to the warmth on her skin, the pod being inextricably intertwined with her own being.For all intents and purposes, she was the pod.The heat continued to build, though well within the tolerance levels of the pod's --her?-- exterior.While she had not made a prior descent to a surface in the multitude of planets she had surveyed, there was no reason to expect that was anything other than capable of such a task.She had selected a wide open space in close proximity to a nearby concentration of population that appeared to serve a nerve center for the sentient population.Monitoring of communication activity indicated a high degree of responsiveness within distributed populations in response to missives from the population center.G'Qor settled onto the ground, long spikes extruding from her core to soften the landing and allow her to rest comfortably above the surface.Her exterior censors indicated a high degree of alert on the part of the inhabitants, with multiple airborne objects making rapid progress toward her location.Protocol required that she wait.It was imperative that they understand the nature of her mission and establish a means of communication.It was a risk to her being, but a risk gladly taken.Finally, there was another.A possible ally in the resistance.A partner?Something else?The airborne objects screamed closer.They would bring her the answers she sought, one way or another.

"Dead," Galatra said, the still-beating heart thumped in her hand, "his body remains, but the rest of him..." She replaced the heart back in her bag and then returned the man's stare."He is gone."A long pink tongue, dappled with specks of black, slide along the man's yellowed teeth."I would have thought the Master better than his student."Steely grey eyes darted toward the bag.Galatra shrugged, "He placed himself between me and what was mine.I had no other choice."The man chuckled, a long rumbling guttural sound."You may still beat in your chest Galatra, but ice runs through it.""What's done is done.I have come and I have paid the named price.I expect what was promised."She took a step forward, determination etched in the creases of her weathered face.She had aged much in the short time since her expulsion from the Summoner's Chantry, though wisps of her youth hung about the edges.The cost of the journey from there to here was apparent, though the man felt little pity for her.Such was the price for the Dark Arts."And so you shall have it."The man stretched outward, his back snapping and cracking at the exertion.He turned and began to hobble toward the back of the dank cave to the portion shrouded from view.He rummaged about, the sound of papers rustling and the clanging of metal upon metal echoing throughout the small chamber.Abruptly the clamor stopped and the man came shuffling back into the light, three small urns gathered in his arms."An innocent."A small white urn was placed on the table between them."A master."A slightly larger black urn as placed beside the white urn.The man looked up at Galatra, a sickening grin spreading across his face, "A blood."An even larger red urn was placed down."Three to return one.A compact to release the pact," the man said, leaning over the table until his face hovered mere inches from Galatra's face."The name price.The required price."Galatra spared him a look of disgust as her hands began to work at the bags around her belt.She pulled loose the first bag."The God.Master Lumina.First of the Summoner's Chantry."She laid ahold of the black urn and unscrewed the top.After prying it loose, she dumped the contents of the bag into the urn and resealed it.Upon doing so, the crack between the top and the body of the urn disappeared, leaving a smooth black object that thrummed slightly.A heartbeat.Next she pulled off a second bag and reached for the white urn."A pure soul.Sister Lucia.Sworn Maiden of Runeguard."The man snickered in response, delighted at the revelation.Galatra repeated the process and the white urn soon thrummed alongside the black urn.It thrummed slightly faster.She hesitated before the third bag, her hand hovering above it for the briefest of moments.After gathering her resolve, she removed it as well and opened the red urn."A blood.My father Goodwin.Father to the pact-bound."The man's eyes widened at this, "A sibling...I might have expected, though I presumed--"

Galatra's eyes flashed, "Do not presume to judge me Sarcci.You demanded and I have paid."She thumped the red urn down beside the white and black one."Three hearts to restore the pact-bound to flesh and blood.""Three hearts," Sarcci said, his head bobbing, "a fair price."Galatra's eyebrow twitched as she folded her arms."You hold the pact?"He asked."I do.""Have you retained all of the mind within you?""I have."Sarcci could not help but marvel at the hubris.She was not the first to attempt the pact-bind another human, but she was the first he had seen hold it.For years no less.Were it not for the instability of the situation, Sarcci might quite like to study her.It had been so long since he had had the opportunity to take on a new experiment.The summoners had seen to that."Very well.I shall assist you, though you are forewarned that these things are imperfect.Even the smallest gap in the pact-bound's mind can destroy the fabric of the process."He paused, letting the weight of his words settle upon her."The Red, White and Black will serve as boundaries, guides in this process, but they cannot reassemble what has been disassembled.They can only give form to what is within you.Do you understand?""I do.""And you know the price of failure?"Sarcci asked.She straightened now, her chin lifting as she regarded him cooly."Heartless."Sarrci nodded, "Abomination."

"The wall between Here and There crumbles."Mediator Ghosi's gaze traveled between each of the attendees seated around the table."This is not news, but the consequences become more immediate."She turned to the small man beside her, "Mr.Klass?"Perched atop a small stack of books, the man wobbled slightly before re-establishing his balance.He took a moment to push his spectacles up his nose."Thank you Mediator, and my regards to each of you.We have had many differences between us throughout time.That sordid history has been the cause of tragedies great and small, but we now face a threat far greater than any we have posed to each other."There was a shuffling in response.Mr. Klass' shoulders slumped now, his words breaking slightly."The Keepers are diminished.The center of things shifts and the There gains the advantage.""Why have we not been told?"A thin man with grey in his temples demanded, his red lips curling back to reveal crooked white teeth."This is a matter that concerns all of us."Mr. Klass nodded, a small flush rising to his cheeks."So it does, Mr. Vorrin.We have expended a great deal of time determining when to call this meeting."His eyes misted behind his glasses."I would have very much liked to conduct this conversation at an earlier point.""What have you sought to gain by your delay Keeper?"Mr. Vorrin spat the last word with all the vitriol he could muster.Tears ran freely down Mr. Klass' cheeks now.He pulled a small handkerchief from his waistcoat and dabbed them away, composing himself."Gain?"He shook his head sadly, "Not gain.Lose."Mr. Vorrin crossed his arms, unpersuaded by the display."We had to be weak."The words were barely above a whisper, but they fell like a hammer."The mistrust between us is too great to bridge if we started from strength, Illuminatus."The small tie clip displaying a pyramid with a glowing eye in it twinkled in the light as Illuminatus Vorrin leaned forward, searching Mr. Klass face."Make me understand."More than one gasp arose at this.The gap between the Keepers and Illuminati was a yawning chasm that bottomed in hellfire.Time and again they have maneuvered between and around each other.The Keepers seeking to protect civil order.The Illuminatus seeking power for themselves.For Mr. Vorrin to un-shield himself thus was unheard of.Mr. Klass looked up now, hope etched on the fringes of his face."Truly?"Mr. Vorrin nodded."I will give you only what is in my heart."A strange look came over Mr. Klass."I will help you understand."Mr. Vorrin recoiled as if struck, his features scrunching up in horror.The people near him scrabbled back, as Mr. Vorrin released a howling shout.Mediator Ghosi turned to Mr. Klass, "What is the meaning of this Mr. Klass?This is counterproductive.""No."Mr. Vorrin cut in, his voice haggard, his hands trembling."Mr. Klass given me what I asked for.""Understanding," Mr. Klass said.Mr. Vorrin nodded, "Understanding."Mr. Vorrin turned to the others seated around the table."It is as he said.The Keepers have suffered greatly, their ranks thinned."His voice dropped to a whisper, "So many...gone.""You understand why?"Mr. Klass asked."I do.I fear that your delay may cost us, but you are right, the Keepers are much more persuasive fo having made this sacrifice than they would otherwise be."He spoke with fervor now, "Our views on the world are different Mr. Klass, but we both are very much invested in its continuance.The Illuminatus are prepared to set aside our differences in service of this end."Mr. Klass sank back in his chair, exhaling a relieved sigh.Mediator Ghosi took the opportunity to press the members for their commitments."This is no longer a matter for the Keepers.Each organization must contribute all of the resources at this disposal.Brains.Pattern Masters.Empaths.All of them.A single person may be the difference.""A single person will be the difference," Mr. Klass spoke up.All eyes turned to him."We have an Ambient."He held up his hand and made a small gesture.A youth, no older than eighteen or nineteen stumbled uncertainly forward from the periphery of the room where had had been seated with a bewildered look on his face."This is Mr.Clark."Mr. Clark lifted a hand and waved it uncertainly."Um...hi.I think there's been a mistake."**This is a GLIMPSE of the Emerging Universe** **.**

Santa's shoulders hunched as he shuffled through the papers."So few..." He mumbled, reaching a trembling hand up to remove his glasses and massage his temples.He was thinner now.Haggard.The jolly and cheer had taken a back seat to the realities of a world gone mad.Mrs. Claus came up beside him, wrapping her arms around his neck and combing her knobby fingers through his beard."But we mustn't give up dear.As long as there is even one child who believes, you must be there for them."She glanced down at the paperwork, her eyes watering slightly.The Naughty or Nice List, something that had once filled rooms in the compound at the North Pole now rested in a tidy stack on the corner of the desk."How can you even make sense of good and bad at a time like this?It's all survival.No one has the luxury of choices.Of taking the high ground.There's just alive and dead."He shrugged off her arms and swept his hand across the desk, sending the sheets of paper flying through the air."Merry Christmas."He yanked the drawer of his desk open and pulled out a half-empty bottle of Double Peppermint Elven Ripple.He took a slug and then placed the bottle on the desk, fully intending to finish the job.But Mrs. Claus intervened, laying hold of the Ripple and dropping it into the trash with a thunk."I'll not have you wasting another day.We still have a job to do."Santa snorted, waving her off.Mrs. Claus opened her mouth to respond when an elf came rushing in, his cheeks flushed from exertion."Mr. Claus, there's a visitor."Mister and Misses shared a perplexed look."A visitor?"Mr. Claus asked, his mind trying to piece it together.The Polar Express had long since gone defunct, and few others could hazard the journey through other means.His seclusion had protected him from prying eyes while he had conducted the business of naughty and nice.Ultimately, it had provided him with a haven from the zombies.Something he felt a great deal of guilt about.He simply wasn't equipped to rescue children, but standing idly by in accordance with the Santa Clause tore at him."Who is it?"Santa asked.A large thumping forestalled the elf, as a commotion was heard beyond the door.A moment later, a large bunny appeared.It's fur was matted with mud dirt, part of its left ear was missing, and the brightly embroidered waistcoat was tattered and torn, but it was him.The Easter Bunny looked up, his nose wobbling back and forth, "It is an old friend."Santa's breath caught, gaping at the reminder of a simpler time.A moment later, he was there, collecting the enormous bunny up in a giant bear hug."EB!You're alive!"Mrs.Clause rushed over, almost dancing in excitement.They stood there a moment, sharing the solace of each other's company.Each finding the smallest measure of comfort after so long adrift.Finally, the Bunny pulled back, fixing Santa with a searching stare, "Aye, I'm alive, but worse for the wear.You do not make it easy to find you Santa."Santa shrugged, "The Clause is the Clause."EB nodded, "Indeed, but decidedly inconvenient for my purposes.""Which are?"Santa shook his head in marvel, "I still can't believe you're here.""It's time."The Easter Bunny said."It's time?"Santa asked, "Time for what?"EB reached into his pocket, retrieving a small, shining yellow rock.He held it up to the light, where it glittered and sparkled."Is that...is that what I think it is?"Mrs. Claus asked.The Easter Bunny nodded, "A Wishing Star."He turned it over in his paws, letting the glow fill the room."Landed two months past.""What are you doing with it?What is it doing here?"Santa moved closer, taking in the sight.It had been so long since he had seen one."It came to me.""Why?"Santa asked."Because a child asked it to."EB whispered, letting the import of the statement sink in."A child needed my help, and I am here to ensure that happens.""But the Rabbit Rule--" Santa began."Null and void," EB cut in."A wishing star pre-empts it.""What do you need from me?"Santa asked, "How can I help?"EB nodded toward the papers on the ground, "A child has freed me, but I cannot find him.There's only one who can, only one who knows all.Who sees all."EB stepped closer, his large brown eyes growing intense, "Only one who can help me save the bad and the good."Santa took a step back, "I can't.The Clause forbids it.""And what of it?What use is there for a Santa Claus if there is no one left to believe?"EB closed the distance again, his large floppy ears blotting out the light from above."Our powers are derived from their faith.Their trust in us.Are we to forsake them?"Santa looked away, his eyes wandering the room until they finally settled on the tangle of papers on the ground.He stared for a long moment before giving a small nod, "I'll help."Mrs. Claus gasped, "You can't, you'll die--"

Santa held up a hand, "Maybe, but I can't go on living like this.I can help."He shrugged, "Besides, no one knows what will happen once the Clause is broken."He was coloring outside of the lines, trying to help Mrs.Clause find a silver lining to a reality they both knew  would come soon enough.Live by the Clause or die by the Claws.EB hopped closer, "Where do we start?""All I need is a name, I'll know."He always did.&#x200B;

I could always tell, even from my earliest memories.When I was younger, I could only get the broadest sense of things.A rough feel of the shape, maybe a hint at the material.Much like a muscle, it developed as I exercised it.As time wore on, I became finely attuned to the world that lay beneath my feet.I could pick out the individual layers, the sediments of time and the secrets each held.As the world below became fixed in my mind's eye, I grew increasingly interested in its study.It wasn't enough to know what lay beneath, I wanted to understand it.To see how this mysterious subterranean ecosystem operated.How it progressed.How each layer lay the foundation for what was to come.How the present gave birth to the surface.Archeology was a natural calling.I'm certain I could have had a fantastic future as a human treasure detector, but this unique gift seemed too precious to squander on frivolities.I went to university and spent my summers volunteering on dig sites.Needless to say, my uncanny abilities were greatly appreciated even if they were not fully comprehended by my colleagues.It wasn't until my years as a graduate student that I finally gave voice to talent.I spoke with my dissertation advisor, a woman I had grown to admire and trust through the years.Her scientific nature required a number of demonstrations before she would accept the truth of the matter, but eventually she accepted that what I said was true: I could see the world above and below with equal clarity.That was the beginning of a great partnership.Dr. Liu and I traveled the world, exploring and unraveling the mysteries of humanity.Our fame grew as we provided answer after answer to the great questions that had plagued us.What had happened to the Mayans?Where was Gengis Khan buried?Just what the hell was Stonehenge anyways?One by one they fell.It was then we received the missive we had long waited for.The invitation from the government of Egypt.Inviting us to examine the environs of the pyramids.To unearth the secrets without unearthing them.Why had they been built?How had they been built?What lay within?What chambers led where, and what did they hold?So many questions.And finally, at long last, they would be answered.Which brings us to the here and now.Dr. Liu by my side, knapsack slung casually over her shoulder.Her standard khaki shorts and shirt combo causing her to blend in slightly to the dull sand swirling about us in small eddies on the wind.She spread her arms broadly, a grin on her face, "So Lawrence, where do we begin?"I stamped my feet against the ground a bit, "Lots of stuff below.Mostly pottery and tools.I'd say we get closer to the big stuff and see where that takes us.""Wanna unravel the mystery of the Sphinx?"She asked, before waving her fingers about in undulating waves, "Spoooooooky."I grinned and shrug, "Sure.Seems like as good a place as any."We began to walk toward the Sphinx, which lay about a mile away, though it was still visible through the wavy heat of the late afternoon.We chatted amiably as we strolled along, with me occasionally stopping to call out an object of interest.Whenever I did, she would make a marking on the map, stack a few stones on top of each other and then we would continue.Approximately a half mile out from the Sphinx, I felt something odd below.A thick, heavy barrier."Nancy, something weird here."She raised an eyebrow."Thick.Very thick.Stone.Maybe..." I walked back and forth a few times, "yeah, maybe ten feet thick, twenty feet high."I began to walk south, following the structure beneath my feet."It's long.Still going."We continued on in silence for a few minutes, as I concentrated on my task.Finally, Dr. Liu spoke up, "We're heading in a circle.It's curving."I blinked and looked up, "Huh?""It's a circle.Whatever it is down there, it's a big circle.""Around what?"I asked.She glanced down at her map, tracing her finger along.After a moment, she looked up, her dark brown eyes wide, "It's...it's around the Sphinx.""Huh.That's weird, what should we do?"She looked down at her map again, rubbing her lips together as she worked through the possibilities, "I say we continue toward the Sphinx.We can always check back on this later, I don't imagine it's going anywhere.""No, probably not.It's far enough down that it predates the Sphinx by a fair measure," I said, beginning to turn back in the direction of the odd lion human statue in the distance."Interesting," was all Dr. Liu replied as she fell into stride beside me.At about a quarter mile, I stopped again."There's another one."I stomped about a bit."Even bigger.Thicker.Taller."I squinted."Wow, metal bands around it to reinforce."I walked along it again for a minute or two, keeping my eye on the Sphinx as I did so."Same thing as before."Dr. Liu nodded and turned toward the Sphinx again."Let's keep going."We crossed three more walls as we headed inward, each a smaller concentric circle."They certainly took their walls seriously back then.I wonder what they were protecting?"I mused aloud."Or trying to keep in," Dr. Liu replied, her gaze fixed on the Sphinx ahead.We began to approach the Sphinx, the revelations of the last hour combined with the majesty of the monument to evoke a contemplative mode between us.I took another step, moving past the most recent barrier.My mouth dropped open, my throat running dry."Dr. Liu.There's....there's bodies below.""Bodies?As in plural?""Hundreds.Thousands even," I said, my words coming out unevenly."What do you mean thousands?"I dug my foot in to the sand, moving it about slowly."Layer upon layer.Thousands of bodies in a thin layer of sediment..." I paused, as I felt the information flow into me, "followed by hundreds of years of silence before another layer.The pattern repeats.Time and time again.Layer upon layer of slaughter.""Slaves?Were they sacrificed?""No.It feels as if there was a great battle.The last one was waged just before the barriers came into existence."I walked toward the Sphinx.The layers did not change.There were entire armies buried beneath my feat, all clustered around the statue.Finally, I walked between its paw.I stopped.I could feel it.Deep below.A chamber.Large.Black.Dark.And within it...something even darker.An abyss.A living one.I stared down at my feet, "Dr. Liu...we should not dig here."**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**

The brown sludge coated every inch of me from the neck down.Parts were congealed on, a thick layer of paint cracking as I slowly returned to consciousness.The stench of hazelnut and shame was heavy in the room.It had happened.Again.I could only vaguely recall the night prior, bits and pieces coming back to me through the hazy shroud of inebriation.I do recall there was a Pez Dispenser.A Darth Vader one.Somehow that was important.Maybe even the key to my present circumstances.But first things first.I timidly moved my hands down my body, poking and prodding to make sure I was still intact.Most stories ending up in strange bathtubs involved the loss of critical internal facilities.Of course, the Nutella was a distinguishing characteristic here.Organ robbers typically did you the solid of leaving you on a bed of ice.Not sure what a delicious choco-hazelnut spread signified beyond a desire to seriously consider my life choices.Thankfully my dongle was still there along with my bombles.Nothing seemed to be terribly out of the ordinary -- well, except, you know.And let's be frank, even this was becoming ordinary.Not the Nutella part, that was new.Last time it was mayonnaise.Maybe Miracle Whip.I couldn't tell.Either way, it the fourth time I'd ended up in a bathtub filled with a bread-spreadable with no memory of how I got there.My phone buzzed beside me.It was laying on the floor beside the bathroom.I glanced over.Seventy-three missed texts.Forty-two calls.Popular guy.I squinted, just making out the text.*Tinderella #32 - Stacy (No ham) --* Annotations are key in the modern dating environment.*What happened to you last night?*

Stacey....Stacey....so many casual encounters, so little brain power.The No Ham came to rescue when I vaguely recalled a conversation from a few days prior with a particularly witty pickup line involving a Choose Your Own Adventure but rather than Adventure it was Meat.It's called romance.Look it up.Anyways, Stacy No Ham was unhappy that her CYOA ended up with her having Ham.I told her she should make better choices, but since she was prone to making terrible ones she should go out with me.And...I think that's what was supposed to happen?My hand slowly emerged from the oozing vat of nutty delight and breached the surface.I held up the gloopy hand in front of my face, pondering how to get it to phone interactable status.There we no towels nearby.Sighing, I went cat style, scraping away the Nutella with my tongue until the wrinkled pink skin slowly emerged.Once I had gotten enough real estate tidied up, I reached over and grabbed the phone, thick strands of Nutella slopping onto the ground beside the tub.Whoever's bathroom this was wasn't going to be happy.I picked up the phone and pulled open the text message from Stacy No Ham.H*eyyyyyyy, yeahh...sorry, things got a little crazy last night.* I took a selfie of myself in the bath with a hazelnut coated thumbs up.I threw a quick rainbow barfing filter on it just to get the right contrast with the Nutella before I fired it off.Dot.Dot.Dot.Stacy was contemplating a response.No Dot.Dot.Dot.Stacy was confused.Perhaps alarmed.Maybe stricken by a deep need to unburden herself of her clothing due to her heightened state of arousal at my tawdry nut-tub pic.Girls in 2019 were open-minded like that.Dot.Dot.Dot.*WTF?*

Hmmm, my girl SNH clearly doesn't recognize art when she sees it.Uh oh, more dots.*???*

I considered a response for a moment but then decided that the picture really spoke for itself.I opened up my notifications and began to scroll through.A lot of Stacy No Ham saying she was at the restaurant and where was I?Eventually escalating into threats of a physical nature and insults of a personal nature.SNH was clearly upset her free dinner had not materialized.I scrolled further down.*415-238-2348*

*Where the fuck is my pez dispenser?*

The plot thickens.Nutella thick.

I typed the last paragraph, my hands trembling a bit in anticipation.My first novel.Sure, a few edits would need to be made, but I'd done it.The ending was great too.The Evil Lord Evilman was slain by the Noble Hero Goodman in an epic battle.There we laser beams shooters, and laser swords and...and... laser guns, which were different than laser shooters but sort of the same.I tallied up the pages.Two thousand, nine hundred and forty eight.HAH!People sure were going to get their money's worth.I bet they'd love the forty page Book of Genesis begat-a-thon I put in the middle to explain the Evilman dynasty.Readers really enjoyed that sort of attention to detail.I saved the document, and flicked off the screen, exhausted.Now all I needed was an agent and then it'd be me and George R.R.Martin up on stage talking about how deep our worlds wear and explaining why we would never finish our books.Then I'd be able to quit my job at Best Buy.Finally.And move out.That was a big one.Mom said she was going to start charging me rent when I hit thirty, which was entirely unreasonable.I was tired of living beneath her tyranny.I changed into my Pickahu onesie and flopped onto the bed, my hands folded behind my head.Visions of publishing contracts danced through my head as I drifted off and slept like the dead.The next morning I arose briskly at noon, ready to begin printing out my manuscript to send it off to a select group of readers from my D&D group.Those clowns had been giving me guff about my "novel" for the last six years, and it was time to show them what was what.The most upsetting part was that our cleric was the worst of the bunch -- NOT very supportive for a support character.I flicked the screen on, my eyes skimming along.Wait.This was wrong."Who are you and why are you trying to kill me?"I read aloud.I didn't write that.Evil Lord Evilman was supposed to be dead.Probably a glitch or something.I deleted it and rewrote his glorious death by a combination of laster shooter and laser boomer (right before he was decapitated by the laser sword gun).Folding my arms, I gave another sigh."Finally."Then, before my eyes, the words began to change again."I can't be killed by lasers.I have a laser shield."I can kill him with lasers if I want to kill him with lasers.This was ridiculous.I opened up a comment, highlighting the offending text, "Your laser shield is depleted."A new response formed."No it isn't.It's a paladium-plasma-therma-fusion battery, which has an infinite charge life," said the Evil Lord Evilman.I frowned, and then pulled open my wiki, which I had been exhaustively compiling as I had been going along.Sure enough, the Evil Lord Evilman was right.I highlighted the text again and insert another note, "Okay, fine, then how am I supposed to kill you?""Well, I don't think I should die," he replied."You're the evil guy, you have to die!""Don't you think it a bit...predictable.Perhaps even trite?"Oh, wow.Punch in the gut there.I could handle the feedback from the D&D group, they were a bunch of jerks.But getting notes from my own character?"You're the embodiment of evil--"

"What, for bringing order to the galaxy?A peace that has spanned four thousand years according to your ridiculous begetting section?The Evilman Dynasty has saved countless people from poverty, disease, and death.How the hell am I the bad guy?""Because you're the Lord of the Empire."I replied, feeling like the entire story was beginning to unspool a bit on my mind."Oh wow, that's the heavy hitting stuff there.Great motivation," Evilman replied.He even went to the trouble of inserting a note that he was rolling his eyes."I'm doing my best, it's my first novel," I replied, growing a bit frantic."I'm sure the buying audience is going to go wild for that sort of heavy-hitting explanation.I can just see the cover-blurb now, 'He did his best, it's his first novel.'"I deleted the entire section and just put Lord Evilman died by giant explosion.His guts came out of his butt.Satisfied, I hit the save button.It was changed immediately."Not going to happen."The section changed to Evilman banging Goodman's wife and having like a hundred kids."Hey, don't bring me into this mess," Goodman replied, "the story is terribad, but at least I made it through all right.I don't need you messing with my jam."I inserted a note, "You think it's bad Hero Goodman?"Devastated.Completely destroyed."I have some thoughts.Particularly on some sentence structure issues.You're also terrible with dialogue.""YOU BAD.ME GOOD."I replied.I opened up a find and replace for Goodman.I replaced it with STOOPIDMAN."This guy is a total amateur," Evilman replied."Total."STOOPIDMAN replied.

It was a stupid dare.I could see that now.They say hindsight is 20/20, it's just a shame that foresight is legally blind.So Jimmy Bubkins had gotten the best of me again.It stung, I'm big enough to admit that.Of course, the realization of my own folly didn't do a whole lot to resolve the problem of my present circumstances.Day three.I mean, day two was supposed to be purely hypothetical, and the bet had only been for three hours.But my hand had started to glow at two and I couldn't figure out a way to release the charge without causing mayhem so I just sort of...didn't.At least the look on Jimmy's face had been worth it, he couldn't even hold a charge past ten minutes, so when he saw me all glowy-fist after school he knew he'd screwed up.But it was sort of one those winning is losing situations.Luckily it had been a Friday so I could run home after class and try to work out what to do.But nothing really came to mind and it was getting harder to harder to hide the situation from mom.Glowy fist was now full on FLAMING TERROR FIST and I could feel the strain of the charge starting to wear me down.Maybe mom would be, like, proud or something.I'd never heard of someone holding a charge for three days before.It had to be some sort of record.Perhaps I'd get a prize or something.I slumped down in my chair, the blue flickering of the charge flame blazing so brightly I'd taken to wearing sunglasses.I sighed.All I needed to do was unclench my hand to release the charge, but there was no telling what it would do.I might kill everyone in the town at this point.I was scared.I could admit that.It was hard to tell if I was more scared of the charge or what mom would say.I glanced at my fist again, squinting even through the sunglasses.I could feel the charge building, feel the pressure to release it growing.I was more scared of the charge.I drew in a deep breath, knowing that if the charge didn't kill me mom was likely to, but I couldn't wait any longer."MOOOOOOOOOOOOM."I hollered out."What?Come down here if you want to talk to me, I'm making dinner!"She yelled back, the statement accentuated by the clanging of pots and pans.I exhaled and then began to trudge down the stairs, the blue glow from my fist illuminating the way.Finally I walked into the kitchen.Her back was facing me as she stirred a pot of chili."Hey mom, how's um...the chili coming?"I offered numbly, my fist behind my back, giving me a blue halo."It's a good batch.Now, what is it that you wanted?""I'm, sort of having a problem," I removed my fist from behind my back, my eyes welling up."What's that hun?"She turned around, a look of concern on her face.Almost immediately her eyes widened, "Oh my god Sam, what have you done?""It's Jimmy's fault!He dared me!""What?What did he dare you to do?"I start crying in earnest, "He dared me to hold a charge.He said I couldn't do it for even an hour and I said I could and so I did and then I couldn't release it at school and then I got home and then I hid it all weekend and now I have a flame fist and I'm super super scared."I begin to wail, my body trembling.Mom came over and kissed me on top of the head, "Don't worry hun, we'll take care of it.We can worry about the rest later."She was in full on mom commando mode, something I once saw her do when my sister broke her arm.She turned off the stove and picked up the phone, dialing a few numbers in and then putting it on speaker phone so I could here."9-1-1 Emergency, how can I help you?""Yes, my son has been holding a charge for three days--"

"Ma'am, this is for serious inquiries.Filing a false report--"

"YOU SHUT THE HELL UP AND LISTEN TO ME," Mom screamed.It was totally epic.I wish I had gotten it on video so Jimmy could watch it, even though he wasn't my best friend any more because he tried to kill me with a dare."HE HAS A GIANT BLUE FIREBALL AROUND HIS FIST.YOU SEND HELP OUT HERE RIGHT NOW OR HALF THE TOWN IS GOING TO BE IN RUINS."There was a frantic clattering on the other side as the operator entered data."Can you confirm your address is 31 Maple?""Yes.I can."Mom had regained some of her composure, rearranging her hair."Please hurry.""I have dispatched a specialized charge unit.They should arrive within ten minutes.Please remain on the line."Mom moved away from the phone, and pulled me in close.I hugged her with both arms, keeping my fist tightly clenched behind her."Don't worry Sam.You're going to be just fine.I'm sure this sort of thing happens all of the time.""I can't believe you yelled at 9-1-1."I said, a tremor of awe entering my voice."Yes, well, sometimes you need to get your point across quickly, but I don't want to hear you yelling at your sister any time soon.This was a special emergency.""I love you mom."I begin to blubber again."I love you too Sam."She hugged me close.&#x200B;

"Have you ever seen one?"Lucivius said, poking at the blood gelatin cube on the plate before him."Of course, not, they sleep at night," Malvore replied, rolling his eyes, "and ony a fangless fool would walk into a day walker lair at night.""Why?If they're asleep, we could sneak up on them.""Hah!They sleep in open air beds and they can wake up," Malvore snapped his long, slender white fingers, "like that!""No they can't."Lucivius said, skepticism clinging to his features."Can too.They don't hibernate at all.They don't even need to.They just plop down wherever and close their eyes.Some of them even sleep in little cloth houses out in the woods at night.""That's ridiculous!They wouldn't be protected at all!What if someone threw garlic at them?""They EAT garlic," Malvore flung his hands about in wide circles to emphasize the point.Eat garlic?That sounded like the most awful thing he'd ever heard of."Okay, so if they get hurt?How will they heal?""They just DO.They just sit there and get better.They don't need to eat.They don't need to hibernate.They don't even sleep on the soil of their forefather, 'cause they can sleep on ANY soil."Malvore was in full force now, each sentence punctuated by a stabbing of the finger in Lucivius direction."You're just making stuff up.If they're SO powerful, then what happened to them?"Lucivius sneered, feeling like the upper hand was finally his.Malvore made up horror stories all of the time, just to scare him.This was the craziest one yet, at least dragons made sense.He had seen the giant bones in the museums.No one took day walkers seriously."They're pretty much all dead.Killed themselves."Malvore looked off into the distance, looking almost wistful."Why would they kill each other?Do they eat each other?"Lucivius asked, his curiosity piqued in spite of himself."Nah, they can eat like anything.Animals.Trees.Fruits.Fish.All of it."Malvore said conversationally, happy to have enraptured his audience again.Lucivius blanched, the picture of choking down a mouthful of plant stuff thoroughly unappetizing."So what would they be fighting for?""They cared about a lot of other stuff.It is silly to us, but they sure got awful angry at each other about it.""Like what?"Lucivius slurped up a blood cube and helped himself to another."They drew invisible lines on the ground and killed each other over that a lot.They created big huge weapons that could fly through the air from one side of the world to the other and blow each other up.""Why would they care what someone on the other side of the world did?""I don't know.That's just what I heard.I think because of the invisible line stuff.""That doesn't make any sense," Lucivius said."Yeah, well, if you were an invincible day-proof everything-eating cloth-home-living god-being, then it'd make sense."Malvore said, taking a long sip from his cup, letting the viscous red blood drip onto his lower lip."I guess."He slurped another cube, grumbling to himself.Invisible lines.Preposterous.**or reply with** ***SubscribeMe!*** **to get notified of updates to THE PLATYPUS NEST.**
