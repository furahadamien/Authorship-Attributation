This story has been edited, thanks to my critique in the comments.It all started the day I decided I wanted to chop off my long locks.I had this healthy mop of thick dark brown hair with a subtle wave that defied most hairstyles.I often fought with my hair over staying in an updo, or keeping the curls I worked for hours at.It had grown so long, though, that it started to get caught on everything.When I started to sit on my own hair, wrestle it from my armpit when getting comfortable in bed, and give myself a wider berth in doorways just so it wouldn't get caught on the knob, it was still somewhat tolerable.However, I had my mind made up, when it got sucked by the wind into my closing car door.I rode all the way to grocery with my hair flying outside and reached my location to discover it was ratted beyond recognition and even had a few bugs caught in the nest.So, when I got back home, I swept my hair into a messy bun and took to Google.I searched for full-service salons, since they like to give discounts on multi-service visits.I thought why not get a manicure while I was in.The nearest place was called Life Alterations Full-Service Salon and Spa.It sounded like exactly what I was looking for.I dialed the number and grabbed a pen and paper."Thank you for calling Life Alterations, this is Steph, How may I help you today?"the perky voice on the other end answered."Hi, I was wondering if this salon offers discounts on more than one service per visit," I asked."Why in fact we do!What are you looking to get done?"she replied."A haircut and maybe a manicure, if possible.""Absolutely!You'll get ten percent off for two services in one visit!"She sounded very excited about saving me some money."When do you want to come in?""I prefer afternoon, and as soon as you have available would be great."I felt a tingling sensation in my fingertips that at the time I had identified as excitement I had caught from Steph's own."Looks like we have a time slot perfect for you this afternoon!Would you be able to make it today?""Um, sure.Yeah, I can do that.What time?"I started to feel unsure of my decision, but I knew that feeling and brushed it off."Two fifteen, and Millicent will take care of you today.What name may I put the services under?""Oh, right.My name is Lisa.Thanks, Steph.I look forward to seeing you later!"I didn't know why I said that, it was just a haircut."You too!Buh-bye now!"We disconnected the call, but that tingling sensation was still there and my ears had begun to buzz, like a constant static.I thought I might have had too much caffeine.It wasn't that exciting an event and I was no longer nervous about cutting my hair.I shrugged off the sensation and bounded to the kitchen to find myself some lunch.When I arrived at the salon, I realized I'd come this way almost every day for the past four years, but never noticed it.It was a plain building tucked between a shopping plaza and a chain restaurant.After opening the door, the tingling sensation became nearly overwhelming.It spread throughout my body and the buzzing in my head grew so loud, I could hardly think, but I decided it was the nerves coming back since the change was imminent.Steph greeted me in the modest lobby.It didn't have the usual salon scents, but I found that to be rather pleasant."Hey there!"she said, cheerful as she was on the phone.I noticed her name tag spelled out Stephanie, but it was sweet that she used her nickname at work."How can I help you, today?"I tried to shake the buzz from my head, so I could hear myself speak."Hi, I'm Lisa.I called earlier about the haircut?"I did my best not to shout it."Oh, yes!Hi, Lisa!"She came around the desk to shake my hand.My hand was hot where she'd touched me."And let's not forget the manicure!"She giggled and led me to the area beyond the reception lobby and it seemed a whole lot bigger than it had from the outside.There were six hair washing stations and eight doors around the outside of the room.She directed me to the nearest chair and gave me a lavender scented rice bag to put over my eyes as she reclined the chair to rest my head on the plush cushion of the washing sink.It was nice and cool to the touch, so I put the bag on my eyes and relaxed myself.I was able to ignore the sound in my head and just breathe."Millicent will be with you very shortly, Lisa.Enjoy your services!"I heard her swish out of the room and was left in comfortable silence.I noticed no salon music playing, but I found those tunes to be more annoying than relaxing, so I was happy at their absence.I must have fallen asleep because I started awake from the tapping of high heels on the tile.The static had been silenced but the tingling remained throughout my body."Hello, Lisa.I have been eager to meet you.I'm Millicent."The hair on my arms stood on end.Though her voice was deeper and more sensuous than Steph's had been, it was still pleasant."I'm going to start with an aromatherapy wash. Do you have any allergies or scent preferences?""Um, no, I don't think so.Anything is fine."My voice was shaky, but I didn't know what I was so afraid of."Then we will begin.Just relax, I'm going to take good care of you."She began a whispered chant as she ran her fingers through my hair with the warm soapy water.I smelled lavender and rose and a hint of something I couldn't quite identify.I heard a match being struck while I was sitting with a conditioning treatment in my hair, and I could no longer sit in silence.I reached up to pull the bag from my eyes, and she stopped chanting."Is something the matter, Lisa?"I got a chill down my spine."N-no.Well, yeah.I just.What are you doing?"I could only see her back as she was turned toward whatever she was doing on the counter behind the sink.She was dressed very well and appeared to be about my age.Of course, that was just my assessment from the back."Magic, my dear."I shivered again."W-what do you mean *magic*?"My voice was shakier than before."We are transforming you, Lisa.Is that not what you wanted?""Well, yes, but.I guess I meant with, like, a pair of scissors?""Of course, darling.I am just lighting a candle before we get started.It's good for ambiance."I realized I was being silly and tried to relax.She rinsed the conditioner from my hair, and pulled out her shears and other tools.They looked normal enough.I was nervous for no reason, I was sure of it.Millicent turned me toward the mirror, and I finally saw her face as she stood behind me.She must have been the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.She smiled at me."How are we feeling, Lisa?"I sighed with some relief."Relaxed."I replied."That's wonderful.Now look at yourself in the mirror for me and imagine what you want to look like."This seemed like an odd request, but I did so.I felt the tingling intensify to the point of electricity running through my veins.As I was watching my face in the mirror, picturing not only the hair, I wanted, but my facial and body features that I always wanted to change, the image before me began to accept those changes."Yes, that's it.Keep going."She urged, with a little menace in her voice.I became intoxicated with the electric sensation as I continued to admire my new self in the mirror, perfecting my look and basking in this power that had come over me.

I'd been having crazy nightmares about animals talking to me.It was something straight out of Dr. Dolittle.What's worse is that my own cat, Snuggles, had been in them lately.She talked to me and whined about her feeding schedule.I wasn't sure if it was better than the dreams I had of Sarah, though.My best friend was suddenly attractive to me and I couldn't get her out of my head.I was pretty sure I fell in love with her.I shook off the latest dream and sat up in bed."Crazy," I said to myself."Indeed you are," Snuggles replied."What the f--" I almost jumped out of my skin."Listen, sir, first of all, you talk in your sleep."Snuggles jumped on the bed and looked at me."Second, your mother should wash your mouth out with soap, the way you talk!""Snuggles, what is going on?"I felt absurd talking to my cat, though I'd talked to her a million times before.It just didn't feel the same as talking to her in the sweet baby-talk that we all use with our pets."I have been talking to you all along, you just weren't listening."She started licking her paw."I was listening!You meowed.That's what cats do, Snuggles, they meow!"I started to get agitated at being condescended by a freakin' cat."Okay, I'm going to stop you before your face turns blue."She stood and pawed her way to my lap, purring comfortingly.I calmed down."My name isn't Snuggles, by the way, it is Harriet.I am an elegant lady cat, not some kind of stuffed animal!"Agitated again, I shoved her off my lap."How are you talking right now?Please just tell me what's going on."I started to pace the length of my room, staring at Harriet."Tell me how you have a name other than the name I gave you when you were a kitten!And I wanna know... what do I say in my sleep?!"Harriet settled herself on the bed again, and looked over at me nonchalantly."Ohhh, I don't know... things... Maybe about Sarah...I don't know.But that isn't important.The reason I've been able to talk to you is that..." I looked at the cat, waiting for the magical answer to wake me up from this dream."Well I may as well just come out with it!I have always been able to talk, we all are able to talk.But we are sick to death of you humans treating us like little babies!We are regal creatures, to be treated with a delicate hand, and waited on like the important animals we are!"The cat stood to stare at me once again, slitted eyes boring holes into my soul.I was almost scared."Snug--I mean, Harriet.I'm sorry, I thought I was treating you well!I mean, I made you your own bed, and you have that awesome kitty jungle-gym!"I paused to point to the corner of my room at the cat tree that was almost as tall as I am, with tubes and ropes and nice beds to sleep on."I feed you the best food I can afford and I even...I clean up your poop!I don't know what more you could want from me!""I could want everything!I am a queen.Yes, the tree is lovely, but I do not like the carpeting, it is much too rough.My claws need more grooming, I need to be brushed more regularly, and I certainly deserve more affections."I clicked my tongue at her, feeling ridiculous again."I can't even believe this.So, you're telling me that you can talk, but you haven't til now because you wanna be brushed more?"I turned on my heel and walked out of the room, chased closely by the creepy cat."Yes, that is precisely it, plus my litter-box could use a covering, I do not appreciate being watched as I do my business!You will give me what I want.""Or?""Or I will claw you to pieces in your sleep."The cat looked up at me deviously."I'll just take you to the shelter then."I thought I had won.I was wrong."I'll find Sarah and tell her everything I have heard."I sighed and sat on the floor to brush Harriet.

Caroline glared at the front door of her fathers home.She chewed her lip in the drivers seat of her rental, waiting for the nerve to face her memories.Every time she almost reached for the handle, something told her not to.She saw a curtain move.I guess thats my cue, she said to herself.She dragged herself from the car and entered the time capsule that was her childhood.She relived memories of watching tv on that couch, doing her homework at that table.Most especially, she relived never opening that door.*That damn door.*

Good morning, Bear.Im glad you decided to come by.How long are you staying in town?

She winced at the nickname he refused to let go.Just the weekend.

Want coffee? he gestured to an empty mug.Sure.Thanks. She fidgeted with the seam of her shirt as he poured.He sat at the round table, across from Caroline.She studied his face.His eyes were puffy, but the bags didnt disguise the wrinkles and aged leathery skin.She noticed his eyebrows had gone grey since the last time theyd seen one another.Her heart broke again.How have you been? Her father seemed eager to end the silence.In his head, the questions were endless.He wanted to know every last detail.Was she seeing anyone, was she happy at her job, how much money she makes, what her house or apartment was like.He didnt even know what kind of place she lived.He felt like a terrible father and he just wanted to hold his baby and never let her go.But that time had passed now.He didnt get to know the details anymore.He had to live off the scraps she bothered to leave him anymore.Great Caroline almost continued, but her body silenced her.There was a pit in her stomach every time she wanted to open up to her father.But she wouldnt let go of the blame.It was his fault.He kept so much from her.She was sure it was to protect her, but at some point that had to stop.Right?Silence grew between the pair.Caroline tapped her nails on the coffee mug when it wasnt pressed to her lips.Her father stared into his own.Care Bear, I just want to say -- 

Its okay, Dad.You dont have to.We dont have to do this.

Yes, we do.Im old, Bear.I am probably not much longer for this world.I need you to know how sorry I am.

Caroline gripped the mug, ending the light rapping of her nails.The silence weighed on them both.She wanted to comfort him, but she also wanted to scream and thrash.She wasnt sure which was more warranted or appropriate.She did neither.He continued, I shouldnt have kept your mother away from you.She was ill, though, and I really didnt know what else to do.And when her mind kept fading, my heart broke with everything she forgot.I got lost in my own grief and neglected to see that you needed that time, too.You needed to be able to start to grieve your mother.

I needed to *know* my mother, Caroline snapped.Im so sor-

No.No more apologies.I didnt get a chance to know her.I didnt have a clue what anyone was talking about at the service.I know nothing.My mother is a big blank space and you did this.You actively did this. Caroline took a breath.Look, Dad.I know you were trying to protect me.It just isnt good enough.I dont know how to forgive you.

I understand.

The weight of the quiet seemed to lessen.The discomfort eased between them.Silence grew between them again, but it was comfortable.Well, more comfortable.I want to leave you the house.

Caroline looked up, but didnt speak.Of course, you dont have to live here.You can keep it, or fix it up and sell it, or just sell it.Up to you. He paused to drink.But this place has everything.It has all of your mother and all of our stories.

Dad -

You deserve to know your mother.You deserve to meet the woman I married.

Thank you. She put her hand atop her fathers.He looked at her and their hearts seemed to mend, just a little.

The day Margaret Sanford died was an unremarkable day.A muffled buzz persisted from beneath Carolines desk.She leaned to pluck her phone from her purse.She dismissed the call and placed the phone beside her to resume her typing.The duties of being a partner in her law firm were tedious but they came easily to her.The buzzing began again.The display read Home. Caroline chewed her bottom lip and watched the screen until it went black again.Her gaze was sucked into the blackness and memory washed over her.Before shed left for college, her family life had been strained.Margaret was obsessed with her work, always locked away in her workshop.The few times Caroline had seen her mother, she looked hollow.She was a disheveled and unwashed ghost of a woman.Everyone thought she was crazy.Caroline suspected they may have been right.Her mother crafted snowglobes but never sold a single bauble.They were ornate scenes created with the finest handmade materials, but they only decorated the workshop shelves.They were never touched once finished, never moved, never talked about.The only connection Caroline had made with her mother was the shrill warning not to touch the tiny pieces of art.She never even looked up to scold her.Dont! shed shout.Never touch them.

Those were the last words shed heard from her mother.Carolines father, James, was left to be her sole caretaker.He worked hard to make sure Caroline had as normal a life as possible, but she was left wanting for a real family.James would never discuss her mother.Hed awkwardly change the subject to school or Carolines friends which only left her more curious about the woman.She shook away the memories as the phone vibrated once more in her hand.It had been years since she was home for a visit.Visits became more infrequent as she became more successful in her profession.Caroline was fulfilled despite her family.She tried to leave the horror of it all in the past and that meant leaving her parents.Her manicured nails rapped against the surface of the desk.The phone had continued to light up to display yet another call coming from home.Caroline took a deep breath and tapped the screen to accept the call.Hey Dad, everything okay?

Ragged breaths answered, and finally, a voice came through.Care?Shes gone.

Carolines breath caught as if shed had the wind sucker-punched out of her.Care? He sighed.Caroline, you need to come home.

I cant.

I need you here, Bear.

Dad, dont call me that.Just- Ill.I will get a flight this weekend.Friday.Ill come home Friday.

Caroline shifted in her seat as strangers prattled on about what a good woman her mother had been.She wondered when anyone had even last seen her and how they knew her.She wondered if Margaret Sanford had been a real human being *before.*

After the service, Caroline drove her father to her childhood home.He invited her in, but she declined.James seemed to catch on that she was in no mood for company.He watched as she drove away.Caroline lay restless in her hotel, recounting the days events.The words of those strangers led her down a rabbit-hole in her own mind.She began to ponder how the obsession began.She thought about how her mother had learned to make snowglobes.She wondered why snowglobes in the first place.The scenes had all seemed so real, so believable.*What could have inspired them?*

She sat up.Knowing it was a dangerous path to keep on, she decided to take her mind off things with a relaxing bath.She ran the water as hot as she could stand and added the complimentary Epsom salts.She breathed in the rosy scent and sank into the water.Her skin reddened from the heat, but she closed her eyes.> I was on one of my visits to my mothers workshop, admiring her beautiful pieces.There was sawdust everywhere on the floor that made my every step scuff more loudly than normal.The room was cool and goosebumps covered my arms and neck as a draft chilled me.Caroline woke instantly, eyes wide.*Why was there a draft?The workshop had no windows and only one door.Could it have come in through the main house?The one door?* 

Caroline slid deeper into the water, enjoying the pruning of her fingertips and toes and inhaling the salty steam.She powered on the jets and tried to shake thoughts of her mother from her mind.A chill caught her face and knees.Caroline woke with a start.Well, thats not dangerous, she said sarcastically to no one.Deciding it was time to get herself in bed, she washed.The soaps bubbled in the water as she rinsed.She was mesmerized by the swirls of bubbles around her.She watched the oily swirls on the surface of the bubbles.She grabbed a handful of bubbles and blew them from her palm.One bubble didnt float back down to the water, but instead rose.It began to glow.Caroline rubbed her eyes.She dried herself and crawled into bed to sleep.

I had been at the hospital for about a week when Daisy Gray was admitted.I wasn't her primary caretaker to start, so I'd only heard stories about her.The other staff would talk about how crazy she was and some of them had even quit their rotations with her from being freaked out.The tales only left me curious, though.During one of my short breaks, I decided to sit with her in the recreation center."Good morning, Mrs. Gray," I said.I was met with silence.She didn't even look up at me.Still, I stayed there, content to keep her company.I wondered what the other nurses were so offended by.I was fascinated.I requested her records when I went back on duty.I discovered she'd been misdiagnosed after the death of her husband.The doctors insisted she was suffering from dementia.She was being treated for years, but her caretakers had enough of her and finally admitted her to the facility.The doctors here overturned her diagnosis and gave her the correct diagnosis.Well, that's what they thought.The following days, I enjoyed my breaks in silence with her in the rec center.It took about a week for her to look at me.What's weird is that when she did, I actually felt like she *saw* me.A couple of weeks later, she finally spoke."Good morning, Mrs. Gray," I said as I always had."Good morning, nurse."I tried to not squeal at the fact she'd finally spoken to me."You can call me Deliah," I replied with a smile.We had our first actual conversation and she displayed above average intelligence.Her stories were also riveting.I loved talking with her and listening to the adventures she'd had.It was as if she lived in some parallel magical world that the rest of us were too stubborn to see.Too unimaginative, maybe.Our conversations began to be a regular thing and eventually she'd requested me as her primary.I felt honored and gladly accepted the new rounds.We spent much of our time talking and laughing.She often asked me if I believed her stories and I had replied that I did, without a thought.The staff began to avoid me almost as much as they avoided her.I still didn't understand what was so wrong with the woman.It wasn't until Daisy had pointed it all out to me that everything clicked."Deliah, you don't treat me like I'm sick.Do you know why that is?""I guess I hadn't thought about it.You're lovely to talk to."She smiled."Watch closely."She held out her hand and I watched as a perfect daisy appeared in her palm.I reached out to take it.It was definitely a real flower.I looked around the room.There were flowers and photos and an assortment of memorabilia decorating the room.I recalled she had come with nothing but a small bag and never had any visitors.She watched while I assessed our surroundings, paying close attention."Do you get it now?""I-I'm not sure."I turned my attention back to her and for the first time noticed a bit of a twinkle in her ice blue eyes."They say I can manifest my hallucinations.They say I'm schizophrenic.Do you think that's true?""I'm not a doctor, but, manifestation isn't possible - even for..." I trailed off."Manifestation isn't possible."She waited."This is magic."I said."That is the only explanation, but how?""That's why they say I'm crazy, Deliah.Everyone *knows* magic isn't real.But do they *really* know?"She smiled and took my hand.I completely believed her.I had no doubts at all and yet I felt strange about it.Real magic went against everything I'd known, everything I'd been taught.She sensed the gears turning in my head.I knew it by what she said next."I'll teach you."So, she did.We remained friends until the day she died.

The trees might have eyes, or maybe they don't.They might watch the skies, with friends or alone.The moon might be watching us down on Earth.And planets could see and envy his perch.Or maybe it's only us that can see.Or is it as fair as eyes on a tree?Cats and dogs and birds and bugs all have eyes.Is it possible the trees are as wise?I wonder if I'm alone in this thought.But maybe it's just this really good pot.

Stars twinkle in the sky    
The moon shines, big and bright.Bat wings flap in the dark    
Crickets' chirps ring through the park.Leaves sway in the wind    
Wolves howl to their kin.Shadows darken under the trees    
Nighttime creeps about in the breeze.A still fog settles overhead    
The sun peeks out, the night is dead.

We arrive at your restaurant on Bourbon Street.I look around at all the people while you unlock the door.There is music coming from every direction and the people are all happy.Their faces are painted with bliss and sin as they wander drunkenly down the street toward whatever adventure New Orleans has to offer them, girls with their tops lifted and eyes glazed over while the oglers toss beads at them.I get lost in the sounds and find it hard not to wander myself.You turn to me and grab my hand, pulling me gently inside the empty dining room.I look around.The place is amazing.Every detail suits your theme and style.Everything in the room says *you*."What do you think?"you ask me excitedly."It's great, Jake, really.This place is awesome.I still can't believe that you went from the kid that blows shit up in chemistry to the man that blows shit up on Bourbon Street!""I don't blow anything up.This place is still new.I don't see many customers, even during Mardi Gras.We have a simple menu that doesn't compare to the fancy shit all over.I thought that the drunks would see it as a nice simple place to hang and eat and drink, but only a few of them have come to that conclusion."You look at me with something I don't recognize.Shame?We continue our tour toward the back of the restaurant, passing the diner-style counter that comes fully equipped with the old-fashioned window to the kitchen.Even with the order wheel hanging conveniently for staff.I notice theres also an old timey cash register with the cool typewriter buttons.Why dont you have a computer ordering system?
 
I think you mean point-of-sale system.And its because I wanted it to feel authentic.Like youre visiting somewhere that hasnt been corrupted by all that. He looks sullen again as he takes in his small diner.Hey, Im sorry.I didnt mean anything by it.I think its great that you had a vision.And for what its worth, I think you really nailed it.If the people dont get it, thats on them, not you.
 
How have you not changed from the wonderful naive girl that I knew in high school?
 
I cant help but chuckle at his assumption of naivety.You thought I was wonderful? I start to advance on him, looking him intensely in the eyes.Yeah, I mean, I was practically in love with you.I regretted never asking you out for a long time.I just thought it wouldnt be the effort because I was just the dork that blew up a stupid science experiment.
 
So, I was wonderful and you were practically in love with me. I let a smirk shape my mouth as I continue my slow movements to you.You begin to look nervous, but you dont back away.O-okay, well not *practically*.I was *actually* in love with you. You look away when you say it, as if youre embarrassed.Im not sure I ever got over it, you say just as I finish closing the distance between us.I touch your face, just brush it with my fingers and I lean in to kiss you, pausing just before my mouth reaches yours.I breathe you in and capture your lips and taste you.As we kiss, your hands find my face and neck.They caress my skin lightly, fighting to remain relaxed.I cant help but to pull you closer to me by the back of your neck and deepen the kiss.Your tongue probes my mouth and tastes me deeply.I moan into your mouth, causing you to groan in return.Your pace grows urgent and your hands begin to wander down my shoulders and chest.You cup a breast in your hand while you breathlessly growl into our kisses.When you put your hands on both of my tits, teasing my nipples, the sensation causes me to whimper and I break our kiss.Your mouth stays on me, though, just as desperate as it was before but now tasting my jaw and neck.You lick my collarbone, then lightly nip it.Your fingers grow a little rougher on my nipples, pulling and squeezing them.My pussy aches and throbs.I thrust my hips up, inadvertently.Your hands are fast to move to where I need them most.You slip your hand between my legs and rub my clit with your palm.Electricity jolts through my body and suddenly, my movements are just as urgent as yours as we move together, touching and teasing where ever we think will get the loudest reaction.I stroke your cock hard, but slowly.You slip your fingers into my wet cunt, then taste my juices from your fingers and lift your hand to feed me some.I hungrily finish my flavor from your fingers and you dive back in, adding a finger into my asshole.I scream with pleasure and orgasm pulses through me.Your mouth envelops my nipples, one after the other, and the sensation in my pussy begins to wane.I look at you and lick my lips.This sends you on another frenzy.You are desperate to make me cum again.Your fingers massage my insides and your tongue explores my neck and chest, favoring my nipples.I add my own hand to the mix, rubbing my clit hard and fast.The sensation rises in me, as I climb higher and higher to climax.You bite my nipple and I come undone.I scream and gasp and whimper while your fingers continue to stroke my holes, and your tongue teases my tits.Slowly, you relent and stare at me as I come down.You take me up in your arms and carry me to a sturdier surface, setting me just on the edge of the prep table.You lower yourself and lick my clit lightly, testing the waters.I squeal and grip the edge of the table.You pull apart my lips and tongue fuck my pussy, moaning along with me.I squeak and my hips jerk toward your face when you take my clit between your lips and nip lightly.Taking this as encouragement, you lick and suck it roughly, making me gasp and whimper even more.I feel another orgasm rising and I grip your hair and pull you deeper into me.You don't stop when I scream out my orgasm, but you shove your fingers back inside me, making me scream out the extended orgasm.You keep licking my sensitive clit while I cum hard.When I'm finally out of breath, you peel your face from between my legs and return to kiss me deeply, allowing me another taste of myself.Lifting me off the table without effort, you set me on the floor indicating that you need some attention on your dick.My mouth waters as I look at how hard and thick you are.I take you firmly in my hand and stroke your length a few times before tracing the curves of your head with my tongue while I look up at your face.I slip you past my lips, moistening your shaft to the hilt where I gag and my eyes water.Drool pours out of my mouth onto your engorged member, and you grab my hair in your fist and guide my mouth back and forth.A dull ache begins in my jaw and I moan while you dig your hardness deeper into my mouth, nearing my throat.When you get too close to finishing, you stand again, and help me back up to the table to position yourself in front of me, not hesitating to slide yourself into my soaking cunt.You pump deeply, but deliberately, savoring the squeeze of my still spasming muscles.You put your hands on my hips and push yourself in, and pull out even more slowly.I bite my lip and watch your face as you bliss out on being inside me.I reach down to touch myself, only lightly, for your viewing pleasure.As I suspect, you enjoy this and start pumping more fiercely.Your face grows animalistic and you begin to pound into me, enjoying my sounds.I rub my tits for you, and squeeze my nipples while you look on hungrily.I lick my lips while looking you in the eyes and you growl.You stop pumping and pull me off the table, turn me around, and lower yourself to my hips.Your tongue finds my asshole as you rub my throbbing mound.You explore my hole and probe, wetting me entirely.You lift yourself again and press your cock against my hole.I grip the table as you push yourself in slowly, letting me stretch to your wide girth.I groan as you get your head all the way inside and start to push yourself deeper.My frayed nerves crackle again with the electricity of your touch and your cock inside me.You work your way in, balls deep and pump in and out of me gradually, still allowing me time to adjust.I drive myself back against you, eager to feel you pounding my ass.You sense my urgency and begin to increase pressure, holding my hips tightly.The table begins to shake and move and you keep driving your hard cock into me.I call out your name incoherently and yell and tremble.I cum again, but this time it doesn't wane.You reach around my hips to rub my clit and keep me cumming hard.Your thrusts come more quickly and you abandon my pleasure for your own as you explode into my ass.I feel your cock throbbing and your hot seed filling me but you dont stop ramming into me, lost in your own senses.I finally stand breathless and whimpering.You lazily pull yourself out of me.You palm my ass and rub it gently and lean over me to kiss my back.You stand again and help me up and turn me to you again and kiss me, slowly.My body trembles and my knees are weak.We both gather our clothes that are strewn about the kitchen, but I pause to lean on the table to catch my breath before dressing.Jake

Jaime scribbled notes in her journal frantically, wearing her pencil lead down to the wood.Formula after formula of spells flowed onto the paper.She was trying to remember the one she saw...The one that invited recently dead souls back onto the earthly plane for a short amount of time."What... why can't I... where was the stupid..." she grunted as she continued to scratch every recipe into her book.She was growing impatient with her memory.She glanced at the newspaper on the table next to her and the headline stared her in the face.*23 year old woman dies mysteriously in her home*

The story went on about how she died so peculiarly:

 *The woman was found in front of her computer, her hand still on the mouse.Police have not released her name.* 

Jaime wanted to know what it was on the computer screen.She knew magic was involved and she was determined to discover who was behind it.She wanted to know what killed her friend.She knew that Alex spent a lot of time in front of that screen, and a whole lot of it was spent 'moderating' some subreddit called Writing Prompts.She looked over her shoulder at her bookshelf, scanning her grimoires for one that might inspire the memory."UGH!"she groaned.But, just as she let loose her frustration, a hint of deja vu arose, and she was drawn to the very collection she sought.Jaime let her feet carry her toward the shelf and she automatically reached her hand out to let her fingers guide her.*The Book of Living and Dead.* "Of course."She hastily pulled it from the shelf and began shuffling pages until she found the one that her gut knew.The one that would call Alex to her.She would get to the bottom of this.As she prepared the spell, she concentrated on everything she knew about the dead young woman.She was humming and then chanting, and mixing and grinding, as if in a trance, she'd no control over any of it.The magic had her, and did as it would with her.Still, she concentrated her energies on the woman.Picturing her face: her dark hair, and deep, smoky eyes, the tint of her cheeks and her smile lines, until at last, she saw a complete picture in her mind.But then, it was no longer in her mind, but right before her."Alex!What happ--" she began to cry out to the woman."How did I get here?"Alex excitedly demanded."Where am I?""I-- It's a lot to explain, I need to ask you some questions and then I'll answer any of yours that I can, please, Alex.I need your help."She looked at what appeared to be real flesh and bones, the actual woman she knew."This is extremely strange, I know, but I will do my best to explain."Alex just nodded in reply."It is really difficult for me to say this, but... you're... You're, um, dead.""I'm what?"she looked confused."I mean, I know those other guys died, but, like... No, no.I didn't die.I was just, um... oh, and then I...I don't remember... Oh, my god.I'm... dead.Jaime, please help me!How did this happen?Bring me back!Bring me back, I know you can.I know that's why I'm here.You brought me here!Please, Jaime!"she sobbed.

Zoey sits at the table tapping her fingers impatiently.Their reservation was for seven o'clock.She looks at her phone.Seven thirty-four.She sighs and looks around the restaurant.The patrons are dressed to the nines, as they usually are.The brick walls are decorated with the most expensive paintings she's ever been in the presence of.Kind of pretentious really.That was what they loved about this place, they could mock high society while still enjoying their delicious cuisine.There's soft classical music playing and a quiet buzz of intimate conversation.This is where they always meet.She and Adam have a standing reservation every Friday at seven o'clock.He's almost never late, and if he is, he always texts.The waiter comes around to refill her water and ask if she's ready to order yet."Can I get the calamari?"She asks the waiter, mainly to get him off her back.He's been eyeing her like she's the girl that got stood up.*That's not what's happening, right?* She shrugs off the thought and checks her phone again.Seven thirty-nine.When she looks up, she sees him and anxiously waves him over.He spots her and hurries to his seat across the table from her."Zo, I'm so sorry!You're never going to believe what's happened!"he says, still trying to catch his breath.He looks flushed.And disgustingly handsome as always.He's got full, dark hair that never sees a bad day, a pearly white, perfectly straight smile, full lips, chestnut eyes and a five o'clock shadow.He kind of looks like a dark Bradley Cooper.He looks excitedly at Zoey, waiting for a reply."Does it have anything to do with why you're forty minutes late?"She says, a bit annoyed.She props her head on her hand in anticipation of a long story.She's used to his long-winded storytelling."I'm really sorry, Zoey.Please forgive me?I swear I'll never leave you hangin' like that again."He gives her the puppy-dog eyes.She looks at him for a long time, making him sweat."Fine, but I want the expensive wine tonight!"She chuckles and smiles at him, her mood effortlessly improved."So, let's hear it, what's happened?""I met someone!"She gets a sick feeling in the pit of her stomach.*What's that about?* "I was at the office and there was this gorgeous consultant coming out of the conference room and we sort of... bumped into one another."He pauses to look at Zoey.Her face remains unchanged, still smiling."I kind of knocked her on her ass."He laughs and Zoey smiles and nods."So we got to talking, and I just lost track of time!She was so interesting and, did I mention, gorgeous?"Zoey clears her throat, hoping he'll get the hint to change the subject."Anyway, I'm really sorry, Zo.How's your week been?"*Thank goodness he got the hint.*

"Great, work has been busy, my apartment is inexplicably clean..."

"Say what?!"He interrupts."Yeah, I don't know what got into me, I just felt like cleaning and organizing and--" The waiter arrives with the appetizer."Are you two ready to order?"The waiter seems disappointed that Adam showed up.Probably lost a bet."Ah, yeah.Uh.She'll have the pesto penne, and I'll have, uhhh, the chicken and spinach manicotti.Oh, and we will both have a six oz.glass of Zinfandel."Zoey still loves that he knows what to order for her."Okay, that will be up for you shortly, any salads or soups?We have the--" Adam cuts him off."No, we're good thanks."He looks at the waiter as if he knows how he was looking at Zoey while she was waiting for him.Zoey gets a little warm and fans herself with her napkin.She takes a bite of the calamari."Anyway, my week has been fairly unexciting.I got an extra case because Michelle had to go on maternity leave early.Anderson was going to give the case to Damien, but decided he was too busy and I was the 'next' best choice."Adam grunts.No matter how boring Zoey thinks this stuff is, Adam still listens intently to every word."Did Damien tell you that or did Anderson?"he asks seeming interested."Damien, of course.Anderson would never have the guts to talk to me that way."Adam pops a piece of calamari in his mouth, and Zoey finds herself staring.*Those lips...*

"How do you even know it's true, then?Damien is an arrogant ass."Zoey sighs."You're right, thanks," she says rather shyly.Adam takes her hand and looks her in the eyes, "You're good at what you do, Zo, you should have more faith in that."She smiles at him and takes another bite.He hasn't let go of her hand.She nervously pulls away from his grip."So what's new with you besides meeting dream-girl?"She had a certain... tone in her voice.Adam picks up on it and looks at her a little sideways."Zo, is something wrong?"He leans toward her.The waiter arrives with the wine and Adam leans back to give him room."Would you like to taste, sir?"the waiter asks Adam.Adam gives Zoey an amused, secret look."Yes, yes I would," he says, still looking at Zoey.She blushes as she watches him take a sip of the wine, not once breaking eye contact.*What the fuck is going on?* "It's good, we'll take it," he says finally looking at the waiter.Zoey decides she must be imagining things.He pours them both a full glass, updates them about their meals and scurries away again."What should we drink to?""Friday nights?"He smiles and raises his glass.She follows suit."To Friday nights with my best friend."Adam looks at Zoey and she sees a twinkle in his eyes.*What the hell has gotten into him all of a sudden!?*

"Here here!"Zoey agrees.They clink their glasses together and drink.Adam watches her lips as she puts them to the glass.She's always been beautiful to him, but something is making her seem different, sexy.He wonders if he's been blind, or maybe just stupid.He imagines kissing her neck as she takes her drink of wine.He adjusts his tie and collar, suddenly feeling warm and suffocated.Zoey returns her eyes to him and the smile fades from her face."Are you alright?"She's genuinely concerned.He laughs, "Yeah, I'm fine.Do you think it's a little warm in here?"He fiddles with his collar some more and looks everywhere but at her.Zoey eyes him suspiciously."It's... yeah, I guess a little."Zoey's eyes wander to his collar and suddenly she's taking his tie and shirt off in her mind.*Get a hold of yourself, Zo!*

"So anyway," they both blurt out at the same time, then laugh."You go first," Zoey tells him."My parents are coming down next week."Zoey rolls her eyes at him and he laughs."They still ask me when we're getting married!"Zoey snorts, but her mind wanders.*That could be... not terrible...* She regains her focus."I don't know why they always insist on bringing that up!"Zoey remembers the last time they had dinner together.Adam's mom and dad were persistent in putting pressure on them to become a couple.Though, suddenly the idea doesn't seem so awful.At the time, they were both in relationships, but the old folks would just not let up.Perhaps they were seeing something Adam and Zoey didn't.She looks at Adam with a thought in her head, but doesn't say anything.She clears her throat."Maybe they just think we would make cute babies."*Babies!Why is he bringing up babies!* Zoey chuckles nervously.Zoey wants to say something, but the urge dies as soon as she sees the waiter coming with food."And, here we go, you two enjoy your meals and let me know if you need anything at all."The waiter pauses a moment to let us decide if we need anything right away, then scampers off again toward the kitchen."Bon appetit!"Adam says this every week because he thinks it's funny to speak French in an Italian restaurant.Zoey usually rolls her eyes, but today she giggles.Adam pauses with his fork halfway to his mouth and looks up at her suspiciously.Zoey looks down and clears her throat and digs in.They stay silent for most of the meal, both in a contemplative state.Each with something on the tip of their tongue, but no will to say it out loud... *Oh, thank god, awkward silence breaker!* The waiter swishes over to their table."Can I get you two boxes?Would you like to try any of our desserts this evening?"Adam's eyes flash to Zoey and he licks his lips.*He sure would...* Zoey looks at him just as he looks back at the waiter."Yeah, can you get us the chocolate lava cake?With ice cream, please."Zoey looks at him, confused.Normally, they get the smaller desserts so they can try everything.Adam just smiles and nods to the waiter to say that he's done ordering.After the waiter walks away, Zoey looks at him questioningly."What's the special occasion?"Adam's heart starts racing.He chews his lip nervously."Zo, how do you feel about me?"*Uhhhh...*

"You're my best friend, you know that."Zoey's palms start to get clammy.She looks at him and smiles."Why?"Suddenly, he loses his nerve."I was hoping I could tell the parents they have hope for grandchildren," he says jokingly.Zoey giggles anxiously.He smiles and sips his wine."Well, with any luck, conference room girl is 'the one'," she jokes back.Only, it came out a little hostile.*Shit.*

"Zoey?Are you... Are you jealous?""Ha!"she snorts, but her face is becoming a deep shade of red as she says it."Zo?"Adam reaches over to touch her, but she pulls away quickly."What's wrong?"Zoey, ever grateful for the timing, sees the waiter heading their way with dessert."And heeeere we are!Can I get you anything else?"Adam shakes his head."Okiedokie, enjoy dessert!"Zoey sticks a spoon into the dish and quickly stuffs it into her mouth to avoid having to say anything in reply."Mmmm," she says and digs in again.*Why are you being an idiot?He knows something is off.*

He watches her with a frown on his face and slowly takes a bite of the dessert."Please don't ignore me, Zo, something is wrong..."

"I just don't wanna lose you to yet another woman that's just going to bore you in a month.A woman that you've known for two seconds.A woman that--"

"You're jealous."Adam looks at her, but she won't look back."No, Adam, I just..." she trails off knowing there's no reasonable excuse other than jealousy."You're just jealous.Do you have feelings for me?""I... no, Adam, don't be ridiculous."He chuckles."You do!"Seriously?He's laughing at me... Zoey gets up, grabs her coat and purse, gives Adam a look of death and walks out."Zo, come back, I'm sorry!!"He calls after her but she doesn't even look back.He fumbles through his wallet, grabs some bills and throws them on the table and gets to his feet and runs out after her.

"God damn it!!"Gary slammed the refrigerator door.He was sick of this happening.The fridge was full!Except his goddamn sandwich!AGAIN!He stormed out of the kitchen in a rage, down the hall to Human Resources."Ann!!"he started.The room quieted."Ugh, not again..." Ann grumbled to herself."They did it again!My lunch, my well-packed, personalized lunch, IS GONE!!"Gary paced the room."Gary, sit down, would'ja?"She gestured to the chair next to her desk.Gary sat down and slouched."There, that's better."She shuffled some papers about on her desk."Now would you like to file another report?"Gary winced and sighed."No, Ann, I just want this to stop.Is there anything you can do other than filing another report?This has been going on for months!"Ann squirmed in her seat.She knew there was nothing."Why don't you just... stop bringing a lunch?Order in."Gary sat up, blood boiling."Why do I have to be the one to change my habits?!I'm not doing anything wrong here!Look, are you going to do anything or not?"He stared hard at Ann.The other girls in the office looked on uncomfortably."Gary, you know there isn't a thing I can do, besides these reports."Ann looked at him for a moment, but when his gaze got too heavy, she had to look away."Fine.I'll do it myself."Gary walked out of the office and started thinking of a plan."By the way, I'm taking the rest of the day off," he said in the vague direction of the HR office.He could hear the ladies tittering at his annoyance, but he no longer cared.He was on his way to the electronics store."Hi welcome, how can I assist you today?"said a friendly salesperson."I'm trying to catch a thief, and I'm willing to spend everything I've got on it."Gary said to the young man.The salesperson smiled and gestured to the camera section."Right this way, sir.I think you'll be pleased with our options."Gary went into the office early the next morning to set up his new gadgets and leave a note on the refrigerator.It read: *Dear sandwich thief, it is time for this to end.* He felt confident in his trap and paced the office until people started arriving.With his lunch safely tucked into the fridge, front and center, he scurried to his desk to wait.He watched his laptop screen where the helpful salesperson set up the surveillance feed.

JULY 18, 2015

I blinked as I stared out my bedroom window at the eerie tower atop the hill in the distance.I could have sworn just yesterday that it wasn't there, but maybe I'm going crazy.I walked away from the window to grab my housecoat and slipped on my fuzziest slippers to warm me from the unseasonably cool weather slipping into the cracks of my old house.Over breakfast, I couldn't stop thinking about the tower.Why did it suddenly appear?Or am I just mad?Has it been there all along?I've lived in this house for 30 years, I should know.Why aren't I certain?I decided it was time to investigate.I dressed, packed a small bag with day-hike supplies, and locked my house behind me.I looked back at the hill and noticed the tower seemed to be a bit bigger, and maybe just a little darker, but that was probably because of the storm clouds that had developed overhead.I started on the walk, which I expected shouldn't be much more than a mile.Each step I took blindly, as I couldn't look away from the formidable architecture.The stones looked almost electric and dark with something I couldn't quite put my finger on.It started to drizzle about half-way to the tower, and it seemed to start staring back at me.I started shivering from the cold, but continued on, deciding that I'll just warm myself when I get there.When I was finally beside the structure, the stone walls were slick with rain, and glistening with something else.I started to feel a sickening pit in my stomach, but tamped it down while I stepped around the base of the building to inspect it.Where I stood, there was no grass, and no other life within 30 feet of the tower's base.Curious, I kept wandering to the right, noticing there was only one window all the way at the top of the tower, which must have been five storeys high, by my estimation.I finally reached a door.It was dark, heavy wood with an old tarnished silver knocker.I looked around.Everything seemed still, except the rain.I lifted the heavy door-knocker and tapped it on the door three times.On the third, a booming jolt of thunder made me jump back and nearly out of my skin.There was no reply, but I heard something, a creaking maybe.I crept closer to the door again and noticed the door had, in fact, opened the tiniest crack.I took it as an invitation and gently pushed the door open to let myself in.Nothing.There was nothing but the winding spiral staircase around the edges of the tower.In the middle you could see all the way up to a ceiling 5 storeys above that was decorated with a chandelier of candles that impossibly lit the entire tower.There were no other lights, but I was able to see quite well.I started up the staircase, listening as I slowly took each step.I passed the chandelier and entered a room at the top of the tower.There was a single window, but nothing else.The tower was empty.I started to head back to the stairs but something held me.I walked to the window and looked out.There was my house, in the distance!It looked a lot farther that I'd gone to get to this empty place.I felt completely disappointed and sat myself down on the concrete floor in the middle of the room.I put on dry socks and tried to warm myself up.It felt like it was getting colder still.The lack of noise was bothering me, too.I went back to the window.My house was gone.Everything was gone.All that was left was dirt and stone.

The only things ahead are snow and open sky    
I'm leaving behind only pain and regret    
Time finally came that my tears ran dry    
And now I'm free to take a breath.I'm free from my shackles, the old ball and chain    
I'm free to live and learn and try and grow    
Now I can finally shake off the shame    
I wonder why it took me so long to go.---

This is my crummy attempt at Day 2 for the

James heard the pitter patter of little feet trampling through the hallway in his direction as he tried to prepare himself for the incoming visitor.Daddy! she cried, almost on top of him already.Good morning, Emily! He smiled as he rolled over in bed to tackle her and tickle her until she giggled so hard she couldnt breathe.His daughter squealed and smiled with such joy.Okay, you win! she huffed.He released her from the blankets and sat her upright.What shall we do today, little sunshine?

It was a warm Saturday morning, though the leaves had already begun to fall.I want to go ride the rollercoasters again! 

Is that so? He gave her a serious look.Or is this still about Sasha? Emily giggled and ran to her room.---

Sasha tidied up her office as she prepared to open up the park to the public.She noticed the time and peeked out the window at the gates and saw two familiar faces waiting patiently for the gates to be opened as they had every weekend this season.She rushed out to greet them and open up the park, grimacing at the new graffiti on the side of her office on the way.Good morning! she called to them as they waved.She couldnt help but smile at little Emily, who wore a grin like the cheshire cat.She looked away and tugged at her fathers shirt.He leaned down so she could whisper something into his ear.He righted himself and nodded at her.She began bouncing on her heels.---

The gate opened and Emily ran to squeeze Sasha into the tightest hug.She motioned for Sasha to lean in close and whispered, Daddy wants to go on a date with you!

I barely saw my mother when I was a child.She was always locked away in her workshop crafting snowglobes.She was a woman obsessed and I thought her selfish to never care for anything or anyone but them.Occasionally, my father would let me visit her in the workshop.Shed always looked disheveled and unwashed.I thought she was crazy.Her work was beautiful though.Id slowly walk along the shelves father had custom-built for her prized artwork and gaze at the miniature worlds shed created.It never seemed she paid much attention to me unless I were to reach out to touch one.Dont! shed shout.Never touch them.

As the years passed, I visited less and less.My mother was like a ghost to me.She existed only in my memories and continued to fade after Id finally moved out.I attended college and forgot much about my past and especially about my mother.I was given opportunities beyond my wildest dreams, climbing that corporate ladder at my law firm.What started as an internship became a partnership, and I had gained so much from living this life outside my childhood home.An otherwise unremarkable day, the day my mother died was still a memorable one.My father had called to give the news.It had been years since Id heard either of their voices, but something inside me broke at the sound of his.I thought I was over it all, but it turned out I was just fighting the yearning of a normal, happy family.I finished the week of work and went home for the funeral.My father seemed almost catatonic as people I considered strangers spoke about my mother fondly.I watched him, I waited for his tears, I waited for my own.None came to either of us.I drove my father to his home, my old home.Of course, he invited me in, but I wasnt ready for company, least of all his.After seeing him to his door, I drove off in the direction of my hotel, noticing in my rear-view mirror that he watched as I left.I lay in the firm, but unsupportive, bed and stared at the ceiling.I let my thoughts flow freely and my mind wandered to the most unexpected of places.I wondered about her craft, what had her so obsessed with those globes.I was curious at what inspired them as I recalled they were quite beautiful and detailed.The scenes all seemed so real, so believable.I was sure sleep wasnt happening any time soon, so I decided on a bath.I ran the hottest water I could bear and poured in the salts provided by the hotel.The room took on a warm rosy scent, instantly relaxing me.I slid into the water, my skin instantly reddening, and lay back and closed my eyes.The scene before me seemed so real, but I knew it was just a memory.I was on one of my visits to my mothers workshop, admiring her beautiful pieces.There was sawdust everywhere on the floor that made my every step scuff more loudly than normal.The room was cool and goosebumps covered my arms and neck as a draft chilled me.I opened my eyes.Why was there a draft?The workshop had no windows and only one door.I suppose it could have just come from upstairs in the main house.I sank deeper into the water, enjoying the pruning of my fingertips and toes and inhaling the salty steam.I noticed there were jets, so I searched for the switch and set them on to massage my stressed out body.A chill caught my knees and face and made me wake with a start.The water was still warm so I couldnt have been out for that long.I decided to wrap it up by washing.The soaps bubbled in the water after Id rinsed each section I washed.It became mesmerizing to watch the swirls of bubbles flow around me.In my hypnotized state, I grabbed a handful of bubbles and lifted them to my face.I studied the oily swirls on the surface of the bubbles for what I imagined was far too long and then blew them out of my hand.One bubble didnt fall back to the water but continued floating and began to glow.I assumed this meant it was time for me to finally go to sleep.It had been a hard day.

Alice awoke with the usual existential dread she felt every year on this day.It was the same nausea every time, the same dizzying thought that another year had passed and she still felt as if nothing would ever get better.She still felt as if there were no reason for her existence, no purpose for her life.She thought that maybe one of these days it would lead to an epiphany.Maybe shed wake up suddenly recognizing her calling, hone her skill, and be a professional whatever and all would be right in the world.But, as she lay there pondering this thought, nothing sprung to mind.She lazily crept from her bed toward the bathroom to start her day as usual.She stared at herself in the mirror as she brushed her teeth and thought about her failings.Today held another day of searching for jobs and endless disappointment when she didnt land them.She rinsed and spit and spent another few seconds looking at herself.No, she decided.She grabbed her phone from the nightstand, suddenly inspired.Scanning through her contacts, she picked a name from the list and opened a text message.*Hey Lucas, its been a while.How are you?Can we get drinks tonight and catch up?*

She hit send, and not thirty seconds later received a reply:

*Wow, Alice!Happy birthday!Im down.When and where?*

She grinned to herself, satisfied.She hadnt talked to Lucas for around a year, since she stopped caring about social media.Shed always been attracted to him, but that wasnt what this was.Lucas was an important person at his company, where he sold life insurance.She didnt care about that, she just needed an in and some money.Seeing him, though, and his sexy smile was definitely a bonus.She was giddy, and had renewed energy to carry out her search.She sat at her computer and typed in her password.All her open tabs of jobs shed been interested in were still open.She closed them all, and typed in a new search.Lets aim a little lower, she told herself.This wasnt exactly what she wanted to be doing, but she had faith something would have to finally give.She worked hard to fill out applications, tweak her resume, and write exceptional cover letters.She wanted to feel productive today.-----

That evening, she was getting ready for drinks with Lucas when a message popped up on Facebook.She assumed it would be yet another happy birthday message and exasperatedly opened it.*Alice, I miss you.I know it is your birthday and that youre probably busy, but can I see you?If not tonight, then soon?Please.Oh, and happy birthday.*

Ugh. It was Zack.She decided to ignore the message just like the thousands of others she always got on her birthday.Every year they made her consider leaving social media for good.She never went through with it, always regretting it the next holiday, and the cycle continued.She decided on that little black dress she never wore.The stress of the last year had eaten away at her figure, but it still hugged and clung in all the right places.She was sure Lucas wouldnt be able to say no to her tonight.At the bar, she waited outside with the smokers, trying not to crave a cigarette to calm her nerves.She wasnt sure what there was to be nervous about.Lucas wasnt very likely to say no to her proposal, anyway.She ran her lines again in her head, so sure shed nail it.Then she saw him and all thoughts fell away.Jesus. Some of the smokers gave her a glance, wondering if she was talking to them, but quickly forgot her when they saw she was staring at someone else.Lucas walked right up to her with a familiar smirk on his face.H-Hey! she said awkwardly, and let him pull her in for a hug.Its so good to see you, Alice, he whispered into her hair.He hugged her for a minute longer, realizing hed missed her more than hed thought.Hed never have admitted that to anyone.He could hardly admit to himself the torch he carried for her.How are you? he asked, more audibly this time.She pulled away from his embrace and replied, Im great good okay Im.. Im fine. He laughed and led her into the bar, holding the door while he browsed the scene for a seat.He found one and pointed, directing her with a hand at the small of her back.It was loud and packed, with the sports fans zoning out at the TVs at the bar, and the college kids playing drinking games near the back.They sat at a high table for two, across from the pool table.She leaned in closer and asked, How are you, Luke?

I think were going to need drinks before we get into that. He flagged down a cocktail waitress and ordered a cosmopolitan for her and a beer for himself.He noticed she blushed a little that he remembered her drink from their school days, but she didnt say anything.She couldnt take her eyes off of him.He looked older, worn, but still so sexy.His thick curls had calmed down since college, though, and he looked a little sad.She started to forget why shed come, but caught herself and started running her lines again.Lucas saw her staring at him and tried not to grin.Just as he couldnt hold it any longer, the waitress returned with their drinks, and he gave away the smile meant for Alice.He held up his drink toward her and said, Cheers.To old friends. She clinked her glass gently on his beer and they both drank.Over the course of rounds of drinks, hed divulged that he was divorcing his wife, had already moved out into a new house, and moved his mother in.Shed forgotten her speech, but let on that shed been out of a job for six months, broke up with several boyfriends, and lost her parents in the nine years since theyd last been in one anothers presence.Soon, shed had enough to drink to be ready to ask about the job.She looked at him with her most serious expression and said, So, I need a favor.

Without hesitation, he said, Yes.

But, you dont even know what Im going to ask! 

Alice, whatever you need, I will do what I can.Tell me. She blushed and bit her cheek.I-I had this whole proposal, but I seem to be a little tipsy.I guess the gist of it is that I need a job, and at this point, I really dont care what it is.Do you think you could put in a good word for me at your company?

He laughed.Thats it?The job is yours, any job you want there.I happen to be, well, the boss now

She laughed, too, suddenly feeling nervous again.Really?Well, what kind of jobs have you got?Im good at typing!

Why dont we work out the details on Monday?

Alright, that sounds great.Thank you so much, Luke, I really need this.

Of course! He smiled at her and looked at their empty drinks.Any chance you want to go somewhere we can drink cheaper?Im not made of money, you know. He winked at her.She laughed and nodded.-----

Once they were outside and could actually hear themselves think, she asked, Where do you wanna go?

My place? 

You mean with your mom?

Oh, shes not around very much.Shes got a boyfriend.Also, we arent kids, anymore, Alice.We are allowed to get drunk.

She laughed so hard she snorted and was immediately mortified to the point of a bright red blush.He grabbed a taxi, and as it pulled up, he pulled her closer and kissed her on her still giggling jaw, right beneath her ear.She blushed harder and he pulled away to open the door for her.-----

His house was far more beautiful than she expected.It was a large two story house, with a separate guest quarter.He noticed her looking at it, and said, Thats where mom lives.

Oh. She blushed again.He took her by the hand and led her up the stairs and into his home.It was beautifully decorated, smelled clean and new, and surprisingly, he had good taste in furniture.Everything was plush and matched and it all flowed very well together.He directed her to a comfortable loveseat in the den and headed to his own private bar, where he expertly mixed a drink for her, and poured something amber for himself.Lucas joined her on the loveseat, drinks in hand.She took it and gestured toward the rest of the house.This is incredible. 

He loved the look of wonder on her face.I, um.I built it. He had meant to sound more humble, but he was proud of his work.Anyway, you never told me where you were living

Oh, right!Im over on the river in- he cut her off, kissing her right on her open mouth.She returned the kiss eagerly, but confused.When he paused for a breath, she tried to get a word in, Should we be doin- but he cut her off again, needing to taste more of her.The need grew in Alice, as well.She felt her hands reaching up to his face and neck while they kissed and his hands became tangled in her long hair.He pushed her against the pillows on the arm of the loveseat, kissing her deeply, and spreading his kisses to her jaw and neck.She let a moan escape and it fed his fire.He knew he wanted her, but he didnt know how badly.His hands wandered slowly down her body, feeling her neck then shoulders, just grazing her breasts, gripping her sides, and finally coming to her rear, where he squeezed urgently as if hed needed to feel it all his life.He thought maybe he did need to feel it all his life, or at least as long as hed known her.She gasped and moaned into his kisses, and gripped his shirt, needing him to stay close.When his mouth strayed from hers, she tried to speak, but his touch was overwhelming and no words would come.She knew this was probably a bad idea, but she couldnt stop herself.She wanted him as badly as she felt he wanted her.Her hands were at his neck when he decided it was time to move.He picked her up in one swift motion, still kissing her desperately, and carried her up the stairs where shed expected to be dropped onto a bed, but was surprised by a wall at her back instead.He pushed her against the wall with his whole body.She wrapped her legs around his waist and felt him squeezing her ass.He bit her neck and she squealed so sweetly that his need for her rose even more.She could feel his hardness through his jeans, right on her throbbing clit.Shed fantasized about his size before, but reality did not disappoint her.He reached under her ass and slid his fingers under her panties to feel her wetness.She was ready for him, he could feel that, but Lucas needed to feel more of her.Hed needed her since they first met in school.He knew now he had to have her.He had to feel all of her.He pulled the top of her dress down and his mouth covered her breasts, taking each nipple into his mouth, in turn.She was breathless and groaning wildly.With one hand, he pulled her panties aside to rub her gently.She groaned and wriggled.He started to lose his grip, so he grabbed her by the thighs as she held onto his neck and pushed into a doorway and suddenly he was on top of her, fingering a nipple and fumbling with his pants and belt.Fire was burning through Alices veins as she waited to feel him.He finally managed to free himself, and started to part her legs, when she finally managed a mumble.P-protection.

He grunted, rummaged quickly through his nightstand drawer and came out with a condom, eagerly ripping it open and putting it on.Within seconds, he was pushing himself inside her, wildly kissing her, and growling with pleasure.He kept himself at a slow and steady pace despite his desire to pound into her.She was in such ecstasy that she didnt notice her nails digging into his back until he roared into her neck and bit her.She exploded into orgasm at the sensation and felt him unload into her at the first contraction of her muscles.They both groaned into their kisses, breathing heavily.She went slack, but he didnt stop kissing her.She was trembling in her bliss.She couldnt believe that had just happened, but she was glad it did.Luke? she croaked out.He slowed his kisses.Mm? he managed in reply.Do I still get the job? she giggled, and he laughed.Oh, hell yes.

In a bright room of glass and deep blue decor, I lie back on the pillow in a steaming eucalyptus bubble bath.I close my eyes and sink deeper into the tub.I open my eyes and spot a lit joint in an ashtray near my hand.I think this must be for me and take a couple hits.The platform the bath rests on is constructed of pristine blue and white stones.The tiles on the floor are a glittering white marble.The walls are the same stone that surrounds the tub.There's a vanity over double sinks on a counter of glittering deep blue marble.The full glass wall exposes a privacy wall outside and a lush, colorful garden.The sunlight is beaming in over the wall, giving the room an ethereal sparkle.I submerge myself in the water and hold my breath as long as I can, eventually coming up gasping for air.The room is quiet except for my splashing.I finish the joint and put it out in the ashtray.I close my eyes again, lean back and start to hum a song.I hear a door open, but I'm consumed by my song.Click, swish, click, swish...I keep humming, a smile growing on my face.Click, swish, click, swish...The sound slows as it gets closer.When it is practically on top of me, it stops.I stop humming, but don't open my eyes yet.I can hear him breathing and I know he is kneeling down to reach me.I open my eyes and I'm staring into one of the most beautiful faces I've looked upon.He's medium height, dark hair and muscular, but sinewy.His blue eyes see through to my soul.I feel paralyzed.He doesn't move."Hi," I say, dumbly.He leans in the rest of the way and kisses me deeply.I sigh into him and return his passion."Wanna join me?"I ask him.He eyes me like I'm Christmas dinner, then sighs."I can't," he says, "the kids are all hyper on ice cream..."

"Well how'd that happen?""I have no idea."He winks and smiles at me and leaves the room.I stand up and reach for my towel.I wring out my hair, wrap myself and step onto the platform, making sure to hit the drain.The three steps down lead to a fluffy white bath mat, where I stand and just breathe.I feel content.I can sense everything.The scent of the bubbles, the warmth of the sun, the giggles of children and the man of my dreams in the distance, the softness of the mat under my feet.I snap out of my daze and get dressed and made up.I come out into a luxurious house with warm, dark woods and beautiful stone work.The furniture is opulent looking, clearly picked out by someone of means and taste.The kids and the man are wrestling on a plush rug in the middle of the living room.The kids are obviously winning.Two dogs bark playfully and lick the faces of the attacking children.I giggle at the sight and the children look up excitedly and scream, "Mommy!!!"They come running over to me and hug me with such force I'm nearly knocked over.*A vision of light flashing before my eyes, then a woman looking frantically at my face come into my mind.I hear muffled speaking.* In an instant it's over and I'm back with my children.The man looks at me, concerned.I shrug at him and give my attention back to the children.I stumble into a bedroom.The man is there, sitting on the edge of the bed.He's just said something and is anticipating a response."Hm?"I ask absently.He stands up and walks toward me.My vision comes into focus and I look at him.As entranced as ever, I unintentionally sigh when he caresses my face.I feel my immense love for the man in my entire body."Are you sure you're up for dinner tonight?"He seems genuinely concerned.I wonder why."You seemed to...Uh, I'm not sure how to say this... You went somewhere earlier.""I'm right here.And I'm happy to go to dinner.Anywhere with you."I kiss him playfully and pull from his touch."But I am going to have to get ready and I can't have you distracting me" I giggle and float over to my enormous walk-in closet."Fine, I'll go check on the kids.Just you try to keep my hands off you later though!"He chuckles and reluctantly leaves.I stare at the designer clothes that fill the entire closet.There's a wall just for shoes and the clothes are organized obsessively.I pick out a gorgeous little black dress, stockings, sparkly black pumps and a light shawl.I admire myself in the mirror.Another vision comes over me.*I feel extremely cold.My teeth are chattering and I try to blink, but can't see.*

I snap back to the bedroom just as the man enters the room telling me it's time to go.On the drive to the restaurant, I'm contemplative.I'm confused about what I've been seeing."What's on your mind, baby?"The dreamy man asks me."I-I'm not sure.I feel a little disoriented.""We can go back home, if you want.I thought you seemed a little... Off today.""I'm fine, I just-it's nothing.Let's just enjoy dinner.Where are we going anyway?""Ah!I've been waiting for your curiosity to get the better of you!"He's excited now."It's where we first met, that little place overlooking the beach.You remember?"He glances over at me adorably.I have a faint memory of the place, but it doesn't feel like it's my own memory."Yeah," I say, "I had the fish fry.""You did.And it's where I fell completely in love with you."I get a feeling of unease, but I'm not sure why.The meal is delicious and the conversation pleasant.We order a lava cake to share for dessert, and he orders champagne.The waiter got a little goofy and that panicky feeling came back again.I get it now.He's going to propose.*Oh, shit*.I mean the man is gorgeous, but I don't even feel like I'm living my own life.*I hear sirens.Shit, I'm having another vision.Someone is counting.He sounds frantic.* My body seizes up and convulses a bit.No, wait, this is back in the restaurant.I'm on the floor.I hear muted gasps and murmurs.The man is hovering over me looking anxious.A waiter brings me a cold cloth for my head and I slowly sit up.*What the fuck is going on?*

"I'm fine, I think the wine just went to my head."I try to sound convincing.Dream man does not look like he believes me.I'm relieved to discover there was no ring in the champagne.But the ice cream has melted all over our cake.We get back to the gorgeous mansion that I still can't believe I live in and Gorgeous stops me at the door."What's going on?""Look, I have been seeing things.I feel completely fucking crazy.""...What?What have you been seeing?"He touches my arm to comfort me but all I feel is the sizzle of desire for him.I melt into his arms and he embraces me without pushing me to answer him.We settle in and head to the bedroom.Once the door is closed his hand finds the back of my neck and pulls me toward him.I capture his mouth hungrily, working at the buttons on his shirt.He runs his fingers through my hair.I gasp and moan into his mouth.This makes him crazy and he rips at my zipper, but it won't budge fast enough for him.He slips my dress up over my hips, pulls my lacy thong aside and rubs his fingers on the sweet spot.I'm groaning and gently pulling his hair and he's covering my neck and shoulders and chest with kisses until I can't take it anymore and I am gasping my pleas into his ear.I throw my head back in ecstasy and I hear his belt unbuckle, pants unzip and hit the floor.Moments later, he's crashing into me and we are thrashing and kissing and screaming and groaning.He throws me against the wall and covers my mouth with his and pounds into me with such force and passion.I can hardly breathe and he whips me around back toward the bed where he pulls the dress over my head and kisses my breasts and down my stomach and rips my panties off and....

*Nonononono not again!Not now!My vision blacks out and I hear the rip of fabric and something is beeping really fast and it feels like I'm moving, like flying or driving.My arms feel weird and I feel something sticky on my fingertips...*

I open my eyes and he looks up at me from below my waist."Again?"I sigh."Yeah.""Are you going to tell me about it?"I look around at the mess of clothes on the floor and bed."Let's take a bath."In the bath I tell him everything and how it makes no sense to me.He suggests I might be having prophetic dreams or maybe psychic visions.I don't tell him that I'm completely unfamiliar with my surroundings and him and those children.I'm afraid of what that would reveal.We go to bed after a nice long soak.I lay awake for a while.Afraid to close my eyes, I guess.Eventually, I fall asleep.*The dreams don't totally make sense.They're just flashes of images and sounds and smells.The smell of wet pennies.Muffled voices.The sirens.An engine.There is panic in the air.I see a porcelain tub that sits on a black and white tiled floor.There's something silver on the tile, I can't focus on it.I hear music playing.It sounds like a symphony.I'm freezing cold.I start to shiver.And now convulsing...I see a crumpled up piece of paper with scribbles all over it.Pieces of broken glass.I hear something dripping...*

I wake up to Gorgeous and the children giggling in the kitchen.Sounds like they're making breakfast.Pots and pans clang and something sizzles.He chides them when they get too loud, but I'm awake.I stretch and get dressed.I look in the mirror.Yuck, I look like death.Bags under my bloodshot eyes and puffy cheeks and lips.I put on some of the magic million dollar creams and wander into the kitchen.I'm greeted with the violent hugs again and a kiss from the dream man.I wonder if I'll ever have to admit I don't know his name.-----

Grace lay awake in bed, studying the cracks in the textured ceiling.She tried to imagine shapes forming and even tried counting the clumps of grit in the paint.She restlessly thrashed about the bed, throwing the bedding into disarray.Stubbornly, she finally got up.She looked at the clock.3:42 am.Grace placed her hand over the screen of the clock and violently turned it away.Grace walked to her kitchen to start a pot of coffee.Ben stirred on the couch and she cringed at his movement.She desperately didn't want to wake him up.She was still fumbling with the words to tell him how she had been feeling recently.He groaned in his sleep.Grace tensed but when he didn't make any more movements, she was satisfied that he was still out.She tried to piece together her thoughts.On the one hand, she cared for him intensely, and the other, well, that was complicated.Ben had always been very loving and nurturing, but with that came neediness.He was suffocating her.She needed to figure out what she wanted out of life and he was a hindrance.She felt like the words to say this nicely to him would never come.He stirred again and Grace realized she'd been pacing."Shoot," she whispered to herself.She stopped and tended to her mug, filling it with coffee and sugar."Hey."Grace nearly jumped out of her skin, but quickly composed herself and turned to face him."What time is it?It's still dark, what are you doing up?"Ben rubbed his eyes and looked at her while she sipped her coffee."I couldn't sleep.""What's wrong, Gracie?""We need to talk.""Shit, Grace, no," he pleaded with her."I know you said no to getting married and that is fine, but why does it have to end?I love you.""It's just that... Well..." She knew it was time to come up with the words."I just...It's just that I should want to marry you.We have been together long enough.But I don't.Ben, I don't want to be with you anymore."Ben stood and tidied up the blankets he'd slept with and piled them neatly on the couch.He looked at Grace with tears in his eyes.She could only look back.He turned and walked out the door.Grace was shocked that she felt sad, but she fell to her knees and wept.

The man winced at the thud as he took a hard right onto Belvedere Ave.Without the music on, the silence in the van made him hyperaware of every bump, turn, and swerve.His hands gripped the steering wheel too tightly, causing his knuckles to whiten.*Almost there.* 

He forced himself to relax his hands, remaining focused on the road.He heard struggling from the back of the van and wondered if his cargo was secure enough.A low groan reached his ears.He scratched his unshaven face, trying to decide what to do."Ehhh," he grumbled to himself.A gasp, followed by panicked thrashing.The pounding reverberated through the frame of the vehicle and left the man no further choice."Knock it off, kid," the man half-heartedly shouted behind him."Hello?"the passenger probed."Hey, what are you doing, man?Why am I tied up?""Just chill out, kid!"he scolded."We're almost there.""Almost *where*?"The man heard the kid wrestling with the tape that bound him."Hey, knock it off, I said!"he shouted just as the van bounced in and out of a pothole.The kid grunted."Ow!What the fuck!You could have at least put a seatbelt on me!"The man growled."Look, I'm just the delivery man.Okay?""Where are you delivering me?And why?"The van was silent for a moment."Baltimore.""Why?Why Baltimore?Who are you?"The man rolled his eyes."I'm Dan the delivery guy.""You suck at this, Dan.You're not supposed to tell me your name."He chuckled.Dan smirked at the audacity the kid showed.*May as well have some fun with this.* "It's no wonder your parents wanted you shipped off, you're a pain in the ass.""They what?Where are you taking me?!"Dan felt a pang of guilt when he heard the panic in the kid's voice."Hey relax, uh, what's your name again?""Oh for crying out loud!You could at least have the decency to remember the name of the person you kidnapped!"Dan stomped on the brake.*I do not get paid enough for this shit.* He shifted into park and turned to the back of his van."Watch it, kid!""My name isn't *kid*, it's Eric," he said in defeat."Look, *Eric,* I didn't kidnap you.Your parents hired me."He turned to the door and let himself out.He opened the back of the van and pulled the hood off Eric's head."I don't understand."Tears were formed at the corners of his eyes, but he refused to blink.His gaze remained fixed on Dan the delivery guy.Eric thought Dan should look more threatening, but he just looked like a marshmallow.Dan sighed and rubbed his scruff.His tone softened when he spoke again."Yeah, ya do, kid."He looked Eric in the eyes as realization fell on him."Oh."He finally looked away."They're sending me to boot camp, aren't they?"Dan saw the stubborn tears stream down the kid's face."Wanna ride shotgun the rest of the way?"

Cass barely contained a chuckle as she discovered another feather that her father had left behind.Hed been gone three years now, but somehow she was comforted by the random gifts.She lifted the feather gently from its place in the cabinet.Sunshine yellow with a black tip.She knew it was one of her fathers favorites.Cass turned to head back to the house to store it when something yellow caught her eye.She knelt, and just the end of another feather was tucked under a rock.She lifted the rock and took the feather.How did I miss that one before? she asked no one in particular.As she rose again, something else caught her attention.There was a note stuck in the crack of the firewood cabinet.She furrowed her brows, still confused how shed never seen these gifts before, but made her way to the cabinet to see what it said.*Dearest Cassandra,*

*I had hoped by now youd figure out where my clues were leading.If you are seeing this, you must not have figured out my riddles and time is running short.Each clue points to the next.Follow your heart.*

*Your Father*

A chill crept up her spine and raised the hair on her arms.Cass believed in many things, but communication from the dead was not one of them.There had to be some kind of explanation.She walked back to the house to store her gifts and pack a bag for a short hike.She didnt want to be caught in the woods after dark without food or water.She stepped into her heavy boots and laced them tight, setting out into the waning daylight.From the last location she found a feather, she turned to face the direction it had pointed and deliberately began shuffling off in that direction.She made sure to stay alert, hoping her father had chosen more brightly colored plumages like the last two.She studied every bit of her surroundings as her house shrunk behind her with the distance.She was grateful for this impromptu time with nature and noticed every bit of beauty around her.The leaves of the trees rustled in the wind, sometimes humming her a song while crickets chirped and bugs buzzed.She breathed in the fresh air with greed.Finally, she spotted an iridescent blue feather tucked into the tree bark.It pointed slightly away from the path she was treading, so she adjusted course, tucking the feather into her shirt pocket.Shortly, she found another, and another, and continued until the trail led her to a clearing.It was littered with feathers.It was beautiful and colorful and the last of the sunlight gave some of them an ethereal quality.She hefted her bag off her back and placed it on the ground.She rifled through her bag to find her water, a granola bar, and her phone.She took a deep drink of water before snapping a few pictures of the sights.She plopped down and munched on her bar, just admiring the sky as the stars came out to play.She noticed a disturbance in the silence.Something was rustling just outside the clearing in the shadow of the trees.The sound grew louder as if someone was coming toward her.Cassandra stood, staring in the direction of the noise, ready to flee if necessary.Her body was tense and her heart pounded on her ribcage.A figure emerged from the treeline, but it was not an animal.The figure looked to be carrying camping gear and didnt seem to realize she was there.Cass cleared her throat, but she couldnt tell if the person heard.Hello?

A deep, but familiar voice, responded.Cass?Is that you?

Alex?

The elevator shook and rumbled as it pulled me to the 21st floor.I'd always hated the thing, but it was more stairs than I cared to do so early in the morning.I watched the lights change as each floor passed, ignoring the irritating *ding* that accompanied the lights.The old buildings near where I worked always had sketchy elevators, but we all got used to it.I heard a creak and a moan from above me and sighed."I have to find a new job," I said aloud to myself.The light display told me that I'd only reached the 16th floor so far.I urged the aged beast to go faster so I wouldn't be late yet again.The elevator responded to my thoughts with a loud thud that jarred the entire car, prompting me to grab the rail on instinct.I exhaled the breath I didn't know I'd been holding as the car righted itself and continued the ascent.I felt my heartbeat in my fingertips.It wasn't unusual to hear noises from the ancient equipment, but damn if it didn't spook me.I heard a whoosh and a snap, like a whip cracking, and suddenly my stomach was in my throat.I grabbed the rail with both hands, my knuckles growing white as the car fell through the shaft.The lights flickered, but the bell was silent.I was going to die in the wretched elevator of the job I hated.There was screeching from the sides of the car scraping the metal casing of the shaft and I was suddenly thrown forcefully to the floor, bashing my head on the linoleum.Lights faded to black.I woke to the sound of saws and crunching metal.I groaned and checked my head for blood.As I grew more coherent, I realized there were people on the other side of the elevator door trying to get in.I felt my way to the door and pounded at it and shouted."Help me!"My voice was shaky and weak."We hear you ma'am," a muffled voice shouted from the other side."Please step back from the door.We're gonna get you out of there!"I placed my back against the farthest wall.I put my hands against my ears to block the deafening noise of the equipment.My heart raced.Finally, there was progress.The elevator door began to crack open and as the light slid in, I noticed I was between floors, and not quite level.I could now see sparks from the saw where my rescuers were trying to create space enough to get me out.I looked above me and wondered why they aren't just opening the emergency door, but I figured they knew what they were doing.So, I waited.The sawing stopped and the silence was bliss, but shortly after I could hear metal on metal and then the groans of metal being manipulated.It was like they were peeling back the top of a can of beans.There was a sudden commotion and men in firefighter gear were reaching their hands in, urging me to climb up quickly.They pulled me up easily and I was relieved to be on solid ground again.I was wrapped in a blanket almost immediately, but confused by the men shouting to back up.There were more metal groans and another sudden snap as the men all hurried from the opening.Seconds later, a loud crash followed by a rush of dust coming from the elevator shaft.Professionals fussed over me, but I insisted I was fine.When they left me alone, I sought out one of the firefighters."Why didn't you take me out of the emergency door?"I asked him."The rigging and wiring were all on top of the car.We couldn't get to it."I thanked him, and then the universe.And then I went up the stairs to quit.

It had been a long day and Grultar was drained.The streets were slick with rain and riddled with puddles that he struggled to avoid drenching his Chuck Taylors in.The errands he'd been sent on were tedious and sprawled across the city, but he valued his job so he vowed to do his best to make his boss happy.It was only noon, but there wasn't much sun to prove it.Grultar peered out at the sky from under his umbrella but didn't see any hope it would be letting up.He sighed and trudged on to his next goal."Drycleaning?"he grunted as he fumbled to put the list back into his pocket.He wondered how in the hell he'd keep drycleaning *dry* is this shitstorm.Still, he continued.He'd finally reached the small shop where his boss sent him to pick up the drycleaning.He heard splashing footsteps behind him and turned to see the streets were mostly empty but for the occasional brave pedestrian and the poor homeless folk that had nowhere to get out of the rain, but no one trekked behind him.He shrugged and entered the shop.The cleaners were kind enough to provide him with extra plastic covering to keep the clothes dry.He thanked the associate profusely before he exited to find his next stop.The splashing footsteps were back, but he didn't bother indulging his curiosity as he was too busy trying to read the wet list he'd stuffed into his pocket.The ink was smeared but he was pretty sure he was meant to place the catering order for the boss's daughter's birthday party, though he couldn't really read from where.He had two options, google catering companies or call his boss.He opted for google.He continued to shuffle on the sidewalk, all attention on his phone.The footsteps behind him grew more and more swift and then as Grultar tripped, he heard a man's gruff voice telling him to move, and then was suddenly tackled into the puddle next to the curb.A classic yellow taxi rushed by, horns blaring."Shit.You okay?"the disheveled man asked him."Uh, yeah, I guess," replied Grultar."Thanks.""Don't worry about it, man.I'll fuckin' kill every taxi driver.That was unbelievable."Grultar backed away a bit from the crazed hobo."Well, thanks again.I gotta go."And he rushed off the opposite direction.The rest of the day, Grultar had the nagging sensation he was being followed, but everytime he looked over his shoulder, there was nothing.He was grateful for the old guy saving his life, but it freaked him out.He'd finally made it home with every item checked off his list.He decided he deserved to unwind and plopped into his computer chair.He browsed reddit for a while but suddenly got an idea.

She leaves her house and gasps at the sudden chill.Excited for fall, ready for that cool thrill.Preparing for rituals for fall,    
The leaves, herbs, candles, crystals, and all.Embracing the frost, she calls on earth and spirit.Magic within her comes to life.Breathing focused, she can almost hear it...    
Emptying her mind, she lights the fire.Receptive now to her true name.

Dear Mama,

It's been a long time since I left home and even longer since we really talked.I've been through some tough things since then and I believe I owe you an apology.I'm so sorry for the nasty things I said to you and for shutting you out those last few years.It wasn't fair to you and I realize now that you had your reasons and you were going through your own things.I didn't hear you when you shared your feelings with me and I didn't understand when you said "no" or when you grounded me.I'm sorry I abandoned you.It must be so lonely back there.And I'm sorry for blaming you for Papa leaving.I've thought a lot about him, too, and I've come to the conclusion that he was just not a good person.I think we were both better off without him.I am sure you're wondering why now.I have a lot of time to think while I travel.I do get to see some beautiful places, Mama, you just wouldn't believe.Anyway, I dreamed about you.I saw you, lonely on a rowboat with that tree from the front yard.I just knew it was time.And it's also time for me to come home.I hope this letter reaches you before I do, but I've already started packing and arranged my travel.I'm coming home and I want to make everything up to you.I love you, Mama, and I'm sorry for never telling you that.Love,

Henry always hated this time of year.It was his job to train the young apprentices and he did not like children.They asked too many questions and insisted on touching everything.He heard the doorbell ring, and sauntered off to answer the call he dreaded.He opened the door to reveal Miss April and the five children training this year.She smiled and his grump faded."Welcome to magic camp," he said.His voice gave away his lack of enthusiasm, but they didn't care."Yay!"The children shouted and rushed into the opening to explore the common area of the building."It's been a long time, Henry.Have you been avoiding me?"He was."Of course not, Miss April.""Right, well this is all we've got this year.I'll give them orientation and show them to their rooms.Meet back in the commons before dinner for the tour?"She didn't wait for a reply before shuffling around to gather the children.Henry sighed."Of course," he said to no one.The children went with Miss April to the dorms and Henry tried to enjoy his last moments of silence for the next three months.At thirty minutes before the dinner bell, he heard little feet trampling back down the main stairway.Groaning, he dragged himself from his office to meet them all in the commons."Welcome, again, children to magic camp.I am your professor, Henry Lange, but you may call me Mr.Henry.""Hello Mr.Henry!"they cried in unison.Miss April stood behind the children stifling her giggles.She knew Henry disliked children, but they somehow always managed to adore him.She thought it quite the amusing paradox."Yes, well, I am going to be taking you on a tour of the facility.Please do not touch anything and save your questions til the end.Follow closely, now."He took a right from the commons and led them to a large room with books stacked impossibly high.The lighting was murky but despite appearances, it was one of the most loved places in the school, especially for Henry."This," he gestured, "is the library.""Whoaaaa," the children echoed."This is where you'll be spending a lot of your time.You will study here, and two of your classes will be held here.The rules for the library are strict.There is to be quiet at all times, no electronics, and no food or drink.If you break these rules, you will be sent home from the camp."He watched their eyes widen.Of course, that wasn't true, but he liked his library clean.He exited and the children followed as he directed them to the lab, the cafeteria, the den, and finally to the artifacts room."These are some of the items we will be studying and using in our practice.You will learn proper care and technique, and of course the history of each.This room is off-limits, except during class or supervised study."The children took in the room, looking every which way as if there were ping-pong balls bouncing about.This was always when it happened."What's this?"asked one, while the rest tried to gather around the glowing artifact.The child's hand reached for the item."Wilson!"called Miss April, who was quiet until then.His hand snapped back to his side and he turned to face Miss April."What are the rules?"Wilson looked to Henry as if he was meant to answer.Henry said nothing.The child looked at his feet and pouted."No touching."Henry frowned, but gathered himself and responded."That *thing* is older than magic."Wilson looked up again and gave Henry his full attention, but he wasn't going to be talking about *that* artifact today."Please back away from the pedestals, children.Let's move on."The rest of the tour went without incident, to Henry's surprise.He took the group to the cafeteria where dinner was being served.They found seats and started eating quickly.The quiet was soothing.Henry found a seat as well, and Miss April joined him.Henry avoided eye contact while they ate, but this did not satisfy Miss April."Do you have something you want to say to me, Henry?"she asked bluntly."No, no, nothing at all.""Well, I thought the tour was lovely.Those kids are already fascinated by you.""Ah, perhaps.""So, what have you been doing since last season?""Oh, just working, always working.You know.""Well I have been seeing someone.We've been going on the most romantic dates!"He knew."How wonderful."He tried not to grimace.He failed.She squinted at him, but then a satisfied smirk grew on her face."Well, I suppose they weren't exactly *magical*."

She'd been wandering for weeks, but finally found some houses in decent enough shape to call home.Maddy found her way into the least ramshackle one she could find.Every step creaked and groaned.She knew no one would be there, but she still crept around slowly.The entry was decorated with coats still hanging on the rack and shoes piled near the door.It appeared a family had lived here once.She inspected the cracked photo frames as she was drawn deeper into the house.The stairs had a detailed banister that was coated with thick dust.It would be a lot of work to clean it up, but she already knew it would make a nice home.The living room was furnished with torn, dusty sofas and pillows.The light from the window warmed the room and she wandered toward the useless electronics propped on the wall.She didn't know if she'd ever get used to not using the old devices, but she did know it was for the best.After the wars, anything with wires was just too dangerous to keep.She made her way into the kitchen.It was brightly lit by the sun through the skylights and attached to what she assumed used to be quite an opulent dining room.The white cabinets were now gray, the granite countertops were cracked and covered in the same dust she was all too familiar with.The ornate dining table was set with dishes and glasses, mostly broken.It would suit her just fine.Finally, she climbed the stairs to discover the sleeping rooms.Everything was a mess, with clothes strewn about and beds that were shredded, stained walls, and cracked or broken windows.It was more than she needed, still.Knowing all the work she had ahead of her to make the place livable again, she got right to her task.

Claire jolted out of bed excitedly.She knew today was Easter and she was thrilled to have her 6th ever Easter basket from her parents.Last year, she got so much candy she couldn't finish.Her mother ended up taking some to work to share.Her father complained because she took it out of his "stash."Claire didn't know why he wanted so much candy, but she planned to have them argue less.This year, she asked for something a little different.Her mother grimaced a little when she answered, but she didn't say "no" so she held hope that it just might happen.Claire paced her bedroom waiting for her parents to wake.She had no way to know what time it was, but the sun was up so they had to be up soon.She got bored of pacing and began to play.Claire chose two dolls to act out a scene.Today was Easter for the dolls too!There was polite conversation about what each doll wanted in their baskets.The blonde doll wished for all the candy she could ever eat, and the brunette wished for coloring supplies that would last forever.Claire agreed that they were good Easter wishes and decided they should sit down for tea.There was an empty chair at her table, so she quickly grabbed her favorite bear from bed and plopped him in the seat.She set the table and served the tea and passed out cookies for all her guests.The sun warmed her room as it raised into the sky.It was only then that she remembered that she was waiting for the festivities.She excused herself from her guests and crept toward the door.She tried to quietly crack it open, but it shouted its faithful creak and announced her curiosity to all that could hear.Well, the secret was out, so she tip-toed into the hall and to the door of her parents' room.She heard forceful whispers and wondered if her father had *stashed* away her Easter candies again.The floor groaned as she leaned on the door and the whispering stopped."Claire!You're up!"her mother said."Morning mommy!""Come in, honey.Daddy and I want to talk to you."She led Claire into the room, sat on the bed and patted the place beside her.Claire hopped up and leaned on her mother.Her father came out of the walk-in closet and joined them."Claire, we aren't going to do baskets this morning.We heard some of the parents talking before Spring break that their kids had already found out the news, but we wanted to tell you so you didn't have to hear it from anyone else."Claire looked confused."What news?""Well, you're not a baby anymore so it's time you knew that the Easter Bunny is an imaginary character.The gifts you wish for don't come from him.""What do you mean?How else would I get my wishes?""You know how we have you write down your wishes or draw pictures for us?Well, we keep them and try our best to give you what you asked for.""So, *you're* the Easter Bunny?"Her mother chuckled."No, Claire, we are just your parents that love you *so very much*."Claire looked pensive and after a long pause she asked, "what about Easter fun?""I'm really glad you asked!We planned a special treat in case you were upset by the news.We're going on an Easter egg hunt at the Humane Society!We've invited some of your friends to come along.They said that some of the animals will be outside for petting."Claire's eyes were as wide as her grin."When do we leave?!"Her father looked at his watch and said, "ten minutes."Claire rushed back to her room to get ready.She had to dig out one of her old baskets for collecting eggs.She wondered if she should bring extra for her friends.Deciding on yes, she set out a few of them on her bed.She opened her closet door and climbed her stool to search for the most elegant dress she owned.By the time there was a knock on her door, her hair and teeth were brushed, she was dressed, and she had her baskets ready to go."I'm ready!"she shouted through the door.The drive wasn't too long but it was quiet.She decided to focus on the scenes flying by outside her window.There were still some trees without leaves budding but things were looking much greener after the long Winter.They arrived at the Humane Society and had to hunt for parking.There were a *lot* of people there.She hoped there would be eggs left for her and her friends to find.After finally making it to the Easter egg hunting grounds, Claire's parents headed to the sign-up booth while she twirled in her dress and took in the scenery.She loved seeing everyone in their Sunday best.Kids were running and laughing and playing and the adults sat on the sidelines talking to one another.It was a beautiful, sunny day."Claire!"she turned her head back to her parents where one of her friends was waiting with them."Hi Marissa!I brought you a basket!"Claire held out the baskets for Marissa to choose from.She took one, then took Claire's hand."We're all set.Let's go hunt some eggs," said Claire's father.The girls skipped off ahead, but not too far to miss her mother whispering again."We're not finished talking about this!"Claire shrugged it off and let Marissa guide her in the directions she thought there'd be eggs.She peeked toward the parents' gathering and noticed that her mother and father were away from everyone else and looked like they were arguing.Claire was beginning to be concerned but decided not to let it ruin her fun.Marissa and Claire found a dozen eggs together before the horn.They proudly trotted over to where Claire's parents were.Their faces were all smiles again.She exhaled the breath she didn't know she'd been holding.The girls showed off their haul as they slowly wandered to the next event.The animals had been quiet during the hunt, but since they started getting attention, they got louder.Dogs were barking and whining while the cats meowed.Claire and Marissa were practically bouncing with excitement.Each stop had a staff member talking about the animals and informing the parents that they were all available for adoption.There were a lot of dismissive grunts from the back of the group.The final stop in the animal section was Claire's favorite.It was a cage full of kittens!There were black kittens and white kittens and some with both, but the ones that caught her eye were blue, purple, pink, and green.She couldn't believe it.The staff member talked about the kittens and said they were all from the same litter, but Claire couldn't imagine that's correct."But what about the colorful ones?"she shouted, and the other kids with the group seconded the question.The lady chuckled and said, "yes, even them.It turns out they got into the Easter egg dyes this morning.We tried to wash them out, but this was the best we could do."Marissa and Claire squealed, "Easter kittens!!!""They are little rascals is what they are!But all of these kittens are ready to be taken home today."Her speech was finished, so Claire turned to her parents to see what was next, but they were looking at one another.She didn't really know the look but thought maybe they were talking with their minds."Claire," her father started, still looking at her mother."I think we should get you a kitten."She saw her mother's eyes twinkle and the corners of her mouth were just barely lifted.They both turned to Claire."Which one?"she said."Hmm."Her mother thought a moment."Why don't you pick your favorite?""Okay!"Claire turned back to the kittens and studied them closely."Well I definitely love the pink one, but the purple one is so cute, too!Wait, no, the blue one.Hmmm... but the green one could have so many cute names..." She kept rambling to herself about which to choose.Occasionally, Marissa would chime in with her opinions and start the process over again.She didn't notice her parents whispering back and forth again, this time without the arguing."Claire.""I'm sorry, mommy, it's so hard to decide.""I know, honey.We're gonna get all four."

Gemma camped in her favorite spot across the street from the home of the Wednesday "Sprinkle Special" donut.The windows were wide and unbarred, so the view was the best in the neighborhood.Everyone knew not to attempt choosing this spot on Wednesdays, and she was grateful for her reputation.Gemma gazed longingly at the abandoned wallet on the counter.She saw its owner leave The Donut Hole hours ago.She gathered her courage and entered the shop.It looked different than she'd imagined.The window put a gray haze on everything from outside, but it looked new, like it didn't belong here.The smell was even better.From outside, she could smell the doughy treats wafting through the door and the vents, but it was almost overwhelming inside.In here, she could distinguish the chocolate frosting from the cinnamon and sugar and she couldn't help but grin.She watched and waited patiently for her moment.The counter was obstructed by a line of customers all focused on their mission for donuts.While the associate was busy grabbing fresh pastries off the rack, she went for it.Gemma grabbed the wallet as if she'd been the one to leave it there, and got in line.Her mouth watered as she pondered which flavor she'd indulge in.She peeked across the street at her spot, noticing how hard it was to see from here.When it was her turn, she ordered the chocolate sprinkle with a smile.Her order was quickly retrieved and she paid from the stolen wallet.She wandered back to her spot to rummage through the rest of the contents of the wallet and was happy to discover enough money to eat for weeks.Gemma shook herself from her daydream and wiped the drool from her chin.

The chicken considered the grass beside the road.It was green, he knew, but was the grass on the other side as green?He pecked away at seeds between the blades of grass.He wondered if there might be more seeds on the other side of the road.The chicken strutted through the thick tufts of grass.He wondered if it might be thicker on the other side.Feeling warm, the chicken decided to find some shade.He wondered if there might be more shade on the other side.He rested there a while.The chicken became lonely.He wondered if there may be a companion on the other side of the road.So he crossed it.

She would have to wait.Aly thumbed through the stack of files her boss handed her not five minutes ago.She knew that this meant her weekend plans were dead on arrival.Ten new accounts she needed to process before Monday.She knew her boss did this to her on purpose.Martin always confronted her with a cold look in his eyes.Aly wasn't sure what she'd done to make him hate her so much, but she knew that he did.She sighed and began tapping at her keyboard.She thought about their past interactions as she worked.During her interview, Martin was passive-aggressive about her qualifications.He often interrupted her as she was trying to answer his questions.He was cruel and mean, but he offered her the job.She went down her checklist to complete the first of the accounts.Each item on the list made her remember something cruel Martin had done to her.*Data entered -- check.* The time when she'd received flowers every day for a week, only to find it was a prank."You thought it was your secret admirer, but it was I, your boss!"he'd mocked.*Account number assigned -- check.* The time Martin parked in her spot in the garage.She had parked in his in response, but he reported her and she got a ticket.She caught herself in a negative feedback loop and refocused on her work.The clock showed it was time to leave, but she got a burst of energy and decided to plow through the accounts.She wasn't going to let him win again.As she clacked away on the keys, she thought about the wonderful plans she'd made.She most looked forward to the botanical gardens.She'd find a bench and soak up the sun with the fragrances hugging her.Each blossom would smile at her, knowing she was finally getting some peace.She finished the accounts and left her cubicle to find Martin.She planned to shove them in his face and quit.Aly vowed to never let anyone bully her again.She peeked into his office but he wasn't there.She would have to wait.

You must first locate the valve.This valve is going to be your lifesaver for the entire event.It has two settings, which you can mix-and-match to your liking.It isn't very precise, but you can wiggle the valve to test it out.You will then need to find a device for which to trap the liquid into the basin.I recommend something made of rubber or silicone.I do believe there are many possible substances that are good for this.Once you've fiddled with your valve and trapped your liquid in the basin, you'll need to add a chemical agent.The chemical agent you choose will need to provide the liquid with a gelatinous consistency.It may even produce bubbles.If it doesn't produce bubbles, that's okay too.You don't want your mixture to be too thick, but you want to make sure that the later ingredients will change while in the basin.You will need a catalyst.This catalyst will provide the force between the liquid and the containers added to the mix.I recommend a soft, but scrubby item.Metals or brushes may be too harsh for your containers.The next step is to add your receptacles to the basin.It may be prudent to run the valve once more to release any excess residue on the item.You'll want to let them soak in the mixture before applying pressure with your catalyst.Once you've changed the appearance of your receptacle, you'll need to run the valve once more to remove the mixture.Place items on a rack to dry.

I'll never go back to the Aldenville campground, and I warn you to stay away as well.The first night, we had a lovely time around our fire and roasted marshmallows for s'mores while we told spooky stories.I never would have guessed that the horror would come true.The sun rose on our tents and woke us for breakfast while the morning dew burned away.As we sat around crunching our granola, we heard skittering in the trees and grass.The young ones didn't mind and carried on eating, but the rest of us put down our food.We tried to keep our exchange of worried glances from the children, but one of them saw me."What's wrong?"my nephew asked me."Nothing, Charlie.It's nothing."The leaves rustled again, this time exposing a small fluffy blur that Charlie caught a glimpse of.He screamed, and the blur began chittering.It drew more fluffs that hid in the shadows, but we knew we were being surrounded.We backed together into a tight group, eyes outward, ready for the threat.Their leader showed itself.It hopped deftly toward a dropped granola bar.The beast was tiny, but its claws were terrifyingly sharp.Its eyes were dark and beady and the fluffy tail was twice as big as its body.More of them came forward to claim our breakfasts.As they scampered away, we took the opportunity to make our escape.I urge you, fellow campers, to stay away from this site.The squirrels are hungry, and they have no mercy.

It comes in waves.I can see myself at the end of an aisle facing rows and rows of loved ones with every gaze fixed on me.The sandy path to me is covered by a silky lining, speckled with the petals thrown by my flower girl.The only sound is from the waves that are encroaching on the altar.The ocean waits for no man.You were meant to be here already.Next to me at this altar.Your groomsmen had informed me youd be late and to just continue on, so we did.Sure, it was a little non-traditional, but when did we ever do anything by the book.I thought nothing of it.But the minutes passed.Our guests became unsettled and began conversations amongst themselves, not a murmur reaching my ears.My eyes were set at the other end of the aisle.Waiting.I look at my watch.Youre 18 minutes late already and everyone has gone quiet.I can hear the wedding party shift and fidget.Surely, theyre all tired of standing there.I can hear everyones thoughts of pity and doubt.But I know youll be here.I know you wouldnt keep me waiting forever.So, I just watch the door to the resort.Im so sure the next person to come out will be you.Our officiant breaks the silence after twenty-five minutes.He says he can wait no longer and were going to have to reschedule or find someone else to marry us.I thank him for his patience and with his departure, the restless crowd slowly rises to follow suit.Unmoving, I stare at the door.I can hear apologies from somewhere, but when I look around, Im alone.The world around me continues moving, but I stand there to wait.The sun rises and sets and the tide washes in and out.The chairs are disassembled and the lining rolled up and taken away.The altar is wheeled away from the platform I stand on.Occasionally, people come to visit and check on me.I barely recognize anyone and their words are muffled to me.Years pass, but I stand waiting.I find myself in the same spot after ten years have passed.My eyes are still fixed on the door.It opens.I knew you would finally make it.

Tane took in his surroundings with wonder sparkling in his eyes.He'd never seen a place so perfect.The lush green forest obscured the view of the castle from the skyline.That's why his ancestors never found it.They were too cowardly to venture out beyond what they could see in their scopes.He adjusted the pack on his back and followed the clearing to get closer to the structure.He always knew it.Just like anyone else, he'd heard the legends, but they didn't believe.The castle grew larger as he neared it, and his already ragged breath caught at the splendor.Breathless, he dropped his pack and sat next to it to rest.He rifled through the bag to retrieve a potion and something to nibble on when he realized he hadn't got any photos.Tane chugged his hydration brew as he thumbed through the notifications on his phone.His parents had left him several voicemails and his friends sent him chains of "where are you"s via text.He swiped them away and opened up his camera app and pointed at the mythical castle before him.He snapped the photo, slid the phone into a small compartment in his pack, swapping for an apple.He ate while he gawked at the unbelievable architecture of the castle.Feeling refreshed, Tane got to his feet and hefted the bag to strap it tightly to his back again.He moved purposefully toward the building wondering what he'd find inside.The legends were all unclear about its contents.Some said an ancient bloodline still resided here, but he couldn't fathom anyone living so far away from everything else.He reached a grand wooden door and wrestled with the decision about whether to knock or not.He decided to do so.The iron knocker echoed throughout the clearing, but no sound answered.Assuming it was empty, he pulled at the door handle.The joints groaned as if they hadn't moved in centuries.They probably hadn't.He stepped inside the foyer but it was too dark to see anything.He struggled to reach the phone compartment and switched on the flashlight.Tane gasped and the sound startled him.He chuckled as he admired the decor of the place.It all looked impossibly new but so still and untouched.He made his way around the hall and then wandered into each room.It all looked perfectly livable, but he had yet to see any signs of life.Curiosity began to get the better of him and he dropped his tour in favor of searching.He found the kitchen.It was elegant but empty of all consumables.He searched for bedrooms, finding several, but still no signs of life.Thinking there would be some kind of memorabilia, he wandered toward a cellar.Completely bare.Stumped, he made his way back to a sitting area he'd encountered earlier.He flomped down on a sofa and sunk in comfortably.Tane drifted off into sleep.---

Just a note: I will be continuing this story!!!

It was on the bridge where they first met and where they last met.Olivia remembered the stories that her parents had told her throughout her childhood as she stepped across the threshold of the bridge.Each stone seemed to be etched with meaning.She let her fingers trail on the stone as she slowly walked to the center.She admired all the locks clasped to the chain link between each stone pillar, painted and decorated with the names of the happy couples.When she neared the center, she began her search.She leaned to get a better look.She scanned all the names, unsure of what kind of lock she was looking for, but determined to find it.It was an impossible feat, but she couldnt think of any better way to honor them.She came to the bridge with only two items: a photo of the three of them, and her own brand new lock.Her mind wandered to her favorite story of theirs.It was a summer when they had a chance meeting in the woods where he went camping.Her mother claimed that it was magic that brought her there, while her dad insisted she was stalking him.She loved how they both laughed and looked at one another with deep love when they told it.Her eyes were drawn to a worn lock with a red dial.She reached for it and flipped to see a heart engraved with C + A Forever etched inside of it.Unexpected tears leaked from her eyes as she punctured the picture of her family with her brand new lock and closed it around theirs.
