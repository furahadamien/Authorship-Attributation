Hey, I'm a regular reader of the "Star Child" story, and I would definitely be on board to buy it in book/ebook form. 

I made this post to see if their was anyone else that was of a similar opinion, and give leo an idea of what pre-orders might be like.

Leave a reply in the comment bellow that simply says "yes" if you're willing.
