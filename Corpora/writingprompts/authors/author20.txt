"What are you doing here?!" an angel exclaimed as I walked through the gates.

"I uh, died? I appeared outside and just started walking."

"Wow. Um, okay give me a minute. We've never had anybody show up here so you kind of caught me with my robe down. Nobody who ever gets this post expects anything but boredom. I'm only here cause I drew the short straw."

"Uh. Can I like, walk around and stuff?"

"Oh yeah go for it. Can't get into too much trouble - you're already dead!"

As the angel went...ah hell, I don't know where they went. As they disappeared I walked around. It wasn't really what I expected, or what anybody would reasonably expect. It was *so* boring. Everything was white! It was like they had never heard of an accent wall.

After wandering around for an unidentifiable amount of time, an orchard drew near. "I could eat," I thought to myself. But when I got to the trees, they were all figs. *Figs.* Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed a good fig - they make a hell of a cookie - but when you think heavenly fruit, a fig isn't necessarily your first thought. Either way, they weren't even ripe. And so I moved on.

I saw some water in the distance, so I thought I'd head there next. Again, the journey felt long and short at the same time, and when I got there I was met with a nicely flowing river. Except it too was somehow boring. There were no stones! It appeared as though the bottom was a PVC pipe cut in half. No fish, no little frogs or toads, nothing. *What.*

I saw some blocky structures past the river, so I made my way through the boring current and carried on. I came up to the structures, and they were...empty. Totally blank. They had doors, and that was it. *So. Much. Nothing.*

As I stood in an empty block, the angel returned. "I can see we're both baffled by this, eh guy?"

"Yeah. Are you *sure* this is heaven? I feel like I'm inside of the stupid drawings I made when I was four."

"Yeah, you're definitely in heaven. But I found out that you weren't supposed to be here. You were too good. We weren't expecting anybody to live up to the standards for a few thousand years, so we weren't ready. In human terms, I guess we're in something called 'alpha testing.'"

"Oh. Okay. So...what now?"

"We can send you back. You okay with being alive, again?"

"Hasn't it been a while? Wouldn't my body be all worm-y and stuff?"

"No, it's only been like two seconds in your time."

"Oh, okay. Sure. I'll go back, I guess."

"Sweet. See you later, I guess!"

And in an instance, I opened my eyes and was greeted by familiar fluorescent lighting. I was back among the living. I stood up off the floor, assured everyone that I was indeed find and had just slipped, and went back to my post. 

Never had working at the DMV felt so exciting.The original prompt:

"Does my liver have a mustache?"

As I began discerning the features of the faces on my organs, the doctor and a group of his colleagues burst through the door. 

"We're sorry, Mr. Buford. You can imagine my surprise when I saw your organs. It's ju-"

"Oh, no, I understand. Who would ever expect to find something like that!"

"It's not quite like that. You see, we *have* seen this before, which is why I ran out. This is very urgent."

That was somehow more stressing than trying to figure out the eye color of my lungs. 

They whisked me away into an ambulance they had prepared, and told me we were headed to a bigger hospital. But when they moved me into what looked like a military helicopter after stopping in the middle of nowhere, it became clear I was headed toward something wholly other.

The whole team of doctors stayed with me. This confused me. If I was becoming some kind of government specimen, why would these civilian doctors stay with me? *Oh...*

"You guys were expecting to find me, weren't you."

"...We're sorry, Mr. Buford, but you are correct. You were...an inevitability."

When we got to the facility, which did have that distinct hospital smell, they ran me through an MRI again just for confirmation.

"Yep, they're screaming," the tech confirmed. My stomach's lips were quivering. Under different circumstances, I'd be tempted to say it looked cute."

I was placed in a bare room, but with all the typical tubes and fluids and beeps you might hear in any average hospital room. I was still sick, or, well, I didn't know at that point.

The first doctor who had examined me came back into the room. 

"You're a very important man, Mr. Buford. Or should I say, you're a  very important dad."

"Uh. Come again?"

"Your organs, Mr. Buford. They're, well, not exactly what they seem. They have the functionality of organs, but in truth, they are alien in nature. When you were still a baby, the aliens picked you to be one of the few hosts that are active at any given time. You're the chosen patriarch of a new bloodline for a creature us humans have been in partnership with for hundreds of years."

"So, am I going to burst open like that guy in Alien or something? Or are you going to kill me and take...the, uh, things?"

"Oh no, no! You're a host for life, Mr. Buford. And the aliens will never come out. But you will have to spend quite a lot of time in the MRI machine so we can communicate with them. We have a technique for reading their screaming. It's not quite as violent as it all looks."

"Oh. So, I'm a prisoner, then?"

"No! We'll let you go, of course. We simply needed to confirm. You see, there *are* a type of these creatures that are more...nefarious. Distant cousins of our friends. It's a whole inter-galactic battle thing. It's all pretty boring. Anyway, we needed to make sure it was our friends that you were bearing, Mr. Buford."

"Oh. I guess nobody would believe me if I told them the truth, anyway. Not that I would want to. How do you casually bring up your heart's facial hair without seeming like a loon?"

"Exactly. Anyway, you'll be free to go shortly. The creatures will keep you safe from sickness and injury. We'll be seeing a lot of each other over the rest of your life."

"Anything else, doctor?"

"Stay away from milk. The creatures that imitate your stomach are terribly intolerant of dairy. That will serve the both of you quite well."

"Great! Oh, one question. Why do they all have mustaches?"

"I can't really say. They have control over their appearance through genetic manipulation. I guess they just like them!"

 
And that was the day I learned that I was a father. It didn't play out how I always imagined it would, but that's okay. I love my screaming, well groomed organ children; and I like to think they love me too.The original prompt:

Even though we had been on the planet for years and believed we knew most of its ins and outs, there was always an undercurrent of disbelief. "This was almost *too* easy," we often found ourselves saying. *Something* should have gone wrong, or at least some kind of curve ball we weren't expecting. It wasn't until the first group of puppies arrived, including my Max, that we started getting the first glimpse of what that secret might be. 

At first, nobody noticed any differences. The settlements were in a frenzy, having finally been reunited with their best friends. And I must say, I found myself as swept up as everyone else. My new little German Shepherd was a bundle of pure delight. The tiniest squeak for a bark, the always excitable tail, the near constant demand for cuddles whenever I had a free moment. It was wonderful, and it seemed like we were finally making this planet a home. 

As our new friends grew, the realization that something was wrong slowly dawned on us. Anyone who had received one of the puppies recognized strange behavior. We noted that at the same time every day, each dog regardless of breed, temperament, size, and any other classification you could imagined, stopped what they were doing started howling. Only for a minute or two, and then they'd return to their normal behaviors. It took us a bit longer and a few more discussions to see that they'd all face the same direction when they howled. 

None of us really knew what to make of this information. There were no other signs from the dogs themselves that anything was wrong. Just the howling in the same direction. There wasn't much else we could do, except see what would happen. 

The months went by, and soon my little Max was an intimidating force. He was the best boy. The only real change was that I wasn't in control of the cuddles, now, as he could just sit on me whenever he wished. He was still himself, including the howling. But a new wrinkle finally made an appearance.

All of the settlers who had dogs had extra compartments attached to their homes, so that their dogs could 'go out.' They'd go to the bathroom, dig holes, roll around etc. Typical dog stuff. One day, I had let Max out as I did every morning, but this time he wanted to go *out.* He nosed the edge of the structure and whimpered profusely. *Strange.*

I messaged the other dog owners on the planet, and asked if they had seen the same thing in their pups. And sure enough, it was a uniform behavior. All of our dogs had become unsatisfied with their enclosures all at once. Our discussions became a little more tense, as it became clear that we were progressing towards...something. 

While we were still discussing, the warning siren began blaring, and a message came through the speakers. *"Warning: A quake has been detected east of the settlement. Please secure belongings, take any other necessary precautions, and only leave the settlement if absolutely necessary. Will update status accordingly."*

I didn't involve any of the other owners, but I knew what I had to do. I went and found Max, still nosing the wall, and asked "Hey buddy! Wanna go for a walk?"

We both donned our space suits, and made our way outside. It was an otherwise beautiful day, but in the distance I could see the dust stirred up by the quake. My experience with ancient movies about Mars told me that this would not end well, but I had to take a chance - I knew at least *some* answers would be there.

And so we strolled on. Though the suit made it hard for Max to wag his tail, he did his best. He was excited about whatever was going on, which put me at some ease. His fearlessness rubbed off on me, and I grew more exited about what we'd find.

We soon found our self at the edge of a fresh cliff. The quake had opened a hole, but it wasn't too deep or wide. I dropped a rock in and quickly heard a sound, so I was hopeful I'd be able to see the bottom once the dust cleared. 

A few hours passed and soon, I could start making out shapes in the hole. At first I thought they were simply rocks, but then I saw a bony snout. *Bones. Dog bones.*

Max had laid down on the edge of the cliff, and his whimpering came through the comms. He didn't sound sad, per se. It was more...nostalgic. He was remembering something. He knew these bones. 

As more of the dust settled, I could see there were a variety of skeletons in the shallow grave. *Dogs are Martian, then.* It sounded crazy at first, but it seemed the only explanation. I messaged the other owners, and eventually they all came. Their dogs ringed the hole, and a chorus of whimpers and muted howls could be heard. We had found their ancestors.

In the days that followed, more and more quakes were detected all over the planet. The dogs' howling was somehow opening up these grave sites. And soon, it became clear that things had been changed forever. The whimpering never ceased, save for those couple moments of howling every day. It was decided that it wasn't fair, far too painful, to put the dogs through this mourning. We would have to send them back.

And so, I put my Max on the next supply ship back to Earth. I sat with him on the ship, made sure he was comfortable, and gave him all the pets I could. I moved to leave, but he tackled me for one final cuddle; I knew then that he'd be okay. But I watched that ship fly away as long as it was in sight, and it was done. As soon as the dogs left, the quakes stopped, and all was quiet once more.

So, now we're going to try cats. Hopefully that will go a little better.The original prompt:

With the smell of my recently killed camp fire still wafting in the warm night, the chorus of cicadas and other bugs screaming away, and the twinkles ablaze in the sky, I couldn't imagine a more perfect scene. "What a perfect end to the season," I said to myself. 

And then the heavens started raining. A shooting star here, one there, and then a downpour. 

But somehow, the rain of stars simply kept intensifying. The rest of the world was still, quiet, serene, well within that perfect balance I had been enjoying just minutes earlier. But above, it appeared that the fabric of space itself was being set on fire. 

I rubbed my eyes in an attempt to see if what I was seeing was merely a byproduct of fatigue. But alas, the stars kept up their assault.  

In confused fascination, I sat on a stump and watched it all unfold. What was I going to do about an astronomical deluge, anyway? But then, my confusion was interrupted by something more familiar. The cicadas. They had grown substantially louder. 

In that moment of distraction, I found myself talking again to an audience of one. "Wait, where are all those shooting stars going?" It was more of a rhetorical thought than a genuine question, and it only made all of this more confusing, in all honesty.

Now feeling the full voice of the bugs in my ears, I turned my attention back toward the sky, as the show was still in full force. I walked around my campsite a bit while tracking one particular star, in an attempt to get a rough idea about where it was headed. I then felt a crunch beneath my foot, and straight above me, the star disappeared. 

I played it off as a coincidence, and found another star to observe. But again, the same thing happened. I heard a crunch, and a star disappeared from the storm above. 

I then realized that even though the sky above me was awash in reds and oranges, I couldn't see much of my campsite. I went back to my hammock, and grabbed a small flashlight out of my bag to take a look at the site. If nothing else, maybe I'd find some clue to the increased noise, I thought. Boy, was I right.

I flashed my beam across the site, and my jaw dropped in horror as I saw the trees. Thousands upon thousands of cicadas had appeared from seemingly nowhere. The reason behind the noise level now obvious, but itself confusing. *Where did they come from?*

And then it hit me. The crunching sound, the stars going dim. It was the cicadas. The shooting stars weren't space rock at all - they were more of the creatures, descending to Earth. In my effort to go camping, I had stumbled into some kind of scouting party who had deemed the way clear, and were now calling down their kind from the heavens with their screams. The scene above me wasn't astronomy; it was an invasion.

And so began the Cicadian Wars.Hello there! Thank you for taking the time to check out my small corner of reddit. If you're here, it's likely that you've already read one of my stories, for which I again must thank you.

Now, for a bit about myself. 

&nbsp;

**What's a 'psalmoflament?'**

It comes from the biblical book of Psalms. The collections of writings therein are typically broken into a few different categories, one of them being psalms of lament. They're essentially songs/poems that express..well lament. I enjoy them because they're good expressions of the low points of the human experience, and are honest in their presentation of how sometimes things are just straight up miserable. Remembering the humble humility often found in those psalms has proven valuable for me, in helping me be more grateful and careful with how I interact with others - you never know who is in a time of lament. A kind word is a safe one.

&nbsp;

**What else do you do?**

My other primary hobby is chess. I've played competitively since I was a kid, and still play fairly regularly. Other than that, I'm pretty boring. I like sports (soccer and baseball, primarily, though I loosely follow most others), traveling, have dabbled in photography, and really enjoy cooking. My favorite television show is Parks & Recreation, and my favorite movie is a three way tie between Jaws/The Life Aquatic/Fargo. 

&nbsp;

**Why do you write?**

&nbsp;

I've always struggled with finding ways to express myself creatively. As a kid I was always the last one to finish every single craft project. I never progressed passed random doodling. I was never much of a musician. I was too top-heavy to dance. Down the list you go, and you'll find nothing where I was particularly talented.

&nbsp;


Now, I'm loathe to say that I'm a talented writer - I don't think that's my place to judge. But what I do know about my writing, is that it fulfills that piece of missing creativity that I always felt held me back in how I experienced life.

The act of pulling an idea from my head, putting on paper/a screen, and using words to build a world, or turn a joke, or prod an emotion - that's why I do it. And when I write, I'm not necessarily even doing so with the aim of pulling those things out of other people; sometimes it's just for me. I've written plenty of story's that I knew would draw no response or even a negative response, but I did it any way because it helped me think of something in a different way. It's a cathartic, cleansing experience, in many ways.

&nbsp;

**How long have you been writing?**

&nbsp;

Off and on for the last 15 years or so, but I only really gravitated to it in the spring of 2019. I'm still pretty bad, at it, to be honest. I've learned a lot over the past few months and am ***always*** looking for constructive feedback so that I can keep growing. It's been fun to learn and apply and see progress within my stories, and I look forward to seeing how my writing continues to change and grow over the course of the rest of my life.

&nbsp;

**What do you like to write?**

&nbsp;

I'm more comfortable in the realms of sci-fi and fantasy. I mostly read sci-fi as far as fiction goes, and I think fantasy has a lot of fun places it can take you. That said, I write a lot of darker stuff, and some of my better received pieces fall into some sort of blend of psychological horror. I suppose more than anything, I like writing about emotions, and I'm willing to write in any genre if I can do that - as long as it actually makes sense in that genre, and is at least attempted in good faith.

&nbsp;

**Should I leave feedback and critique?**

&nbsp;

If you're willing to donate your time to helping me improve, please, by all means! I know I mentioned it above, but just in case there are any doubts, I wanted to specifically note that I welcome critique and feedback. 

&nbsp;

That's all I have for now. If there are any questions or suggestions for further additions to this introduction, please feel free to let me know. 

&nbsp;

Thanks again for stopping by. It means the world to me.The original prompt:

It was always just "John." I had known Barry for years, watched him give nicknames to the hundreds of people who have run in and out of the circles of our lives. But there was something more boring about me, I guess; nothing worth noting that required a special name. It usually didn't bother me. There was a certain pride in being his only friend with a 'normal' name, after all.

In any case, there never seemed to be a good time to bring it up. Barry had lived a hard life, as far as I could tell. He was always a little bit off and nobody cared to take the time to set themselves off-center so they could see eye to eye. He always tried to reach up to their level, but more often than not he'd only end up grasping air. He wasn't alone, but he was lonely. A searching soul, unsure of how to find its way.

I always made as much time for Barry as I could. I admit that I struggled with identifying with him as much as anyone, but it seemed the effort was more important than the result. Barry always smiled when I'd round the corner of the school hall. "Hey, John!" he'd always yell before an awkward scurry in my direction. We'd talk about his day - what he had left to do, if he met anyone new, etc. You know, general chit-chat. For discussion topics that held such little substance, they carried a surprising amount of weight to both of us. After a while, I found I looked forward to our little encounters. So, at the very least, there was one person who needed him.

Years went by and our friendship grew deeper. High school graduation grew close, so I knew the dynamic of our relationship would soon change. Barry had been accepted to a state college a few hours away. He had assured me I'd be going with him, but I had my doubts. All I could see on the horizon was a sense of loss, and I wasn't sure why. In the tumult of my emotions, buried jealousies started to surface. 

*Why is it always just John? All these years, and there still isn't anything special about me? I'm his only friend! Of all people, shouldn't I have the nicknames?*

It was selfish, but the feelings were real. Regardless of how our relationship was to change, I knew I had to find an answer to those questions. If nothing else, it would keep those jealousies at bay and avoid the chance of all this becoming a debacle. So, I decided to ask him next time we talked.

"Barry. Why have you never given me a nickname?"

"Huh?"

"You always just call me John. You've given nicknames to literally everyone else. You call the basketball players Springs. The mathletes you call Brainsters. Even that guy in biology with the ear gauges who still doesn't know you exist you call Lobes. Am I just too boring?"

"Oh, I could never give you a name like all of them!"

"But why?"

"Because they're real. Imaginary friends don't have bodies!"

I took a deep look inward, and it finally clicked. It's why I was able to understand Barry. It's why I knew who everyone was, but never wanted to interact with them. And it's why Barry was so confident that I'd be with him at college. There wasn't anywhere else I could go.

I got over it pretty quickly. I still had a name, and was still real in important ways. I helped Barry through his life; gave him a place where he found value and companionship. He knew he was never alone. Maybe some day he wouldn't need me, and I'd go back into the ether. But for now I'll simply enjoy being alive, while I have a place in this world.

In the end, only being John is just fine.The original prompt:

Growing up in a small town, I often had nothing better to do than wander the streets by myself while waiting for the sun to set. There was nothing special about the place; not much to do, less to see, and somehow even less to attain. Schooling was basic, and for orphans like myself, only for a couple hours every morning. So, every mid day, out into the roads I would go.

The only distinction between the otherwise drab and gray painted homes were the bright red numbers above the doors. 2, 29, 16, 33...I had the order memorized. Even through the exceeding boredom, there was always a shared sense of anticipation because of those numbers. Nobody knew when, nobody knew how, but we all knew the what. I always felt sorry for 2. Their predecessor had died long ago, so their line grew short. I had a hard time imagining the burden of knowing for certain that you were next.

For most of the other orphans, they had their numbers painted on their bed frames. 3, 9, 21, 66...Except for mine. My frame was blank. I would ask the caretakers when I was meant to die, but they could never give a solid answer. "We don't even know who you are," is all they could offer.

And it was true. Nobody knew who I was. I didn't even have a proper name. People called me Null, because it was as if I wasn't actually there. I didn't like it at first, but I eventually heard the ring to it. 

As time went on, I added a bit of bravery to my daily walks around town - I decided to start knocking on the doors. Some people I would occasionally see walking about, or when they would drop donations by the orphanage, but for the most part I didn't know the faces behind the numbers. I started with 2, as I figured I might not get another chance.

They proved to be a nice old man. We spent many afternoons together, mostly just small talk. Eventually, I asked if he knew who I was, considering he had been here for quite some time. Unfortunately, he said no. But I didn't mind - it was simply nice that somebody else was treating me as a person rather than some kind of apparition.

Over time, I developed similar relationships with most of the town. They all proved quite friendly, but equally useless in helping me solve the riddle of my existence. But again, I paid no mind. I was part of a community, at last, and I belonged.

But as they say, all good things come to an end. Soon 2 became just a memory, as did 3, 4, 5...they all started disappearing, just as they were meant to. But this time, they weren't being replaced. The numbers didn't start over, they just reached their end. And it became clear what my fate held: loneliness.

Even though I was grown, I was still living at the orphanage. And soon it was just me. Even 66 was gone, and he was the highest number we ever had. Eventually, it was me and 492 - the final number. But they too passed, and only silence remained.

The decades went past, but I still continued those daily walks around town I began so many years ago. The formerly vibrant numbers now only dry, chipped remnants of their fulfilled purpose. I thought of the former inhabitants of the decrepit homes that were all now silent, though their faces now began to fade. They started to feel as imaginary as I was, which only made me long for a death that apparently wasn't meant for me. 

I could leave if I wanted to, I suppose, but I'll be even more unknown out there than I am here. At least in my personal ghost town I have a history; memories, visages I can hold on to. And so here I'll remain, writing my histories, putting into words the little memories and conversations I hold dear. It's a solemn life, but its mine. With any luck, perhaps death will someday do me the grace of a visit. But until then, I'm happy to remain the forgotten immortal.The original prompt:

My son had always loved to finger paint. As soon as he found the wonderful, squishy colors, our house became a gallery for his art. His imagination knew no limits, it seemed, and he had found a way to express himself in ways that I was frankly a little jealous of. He had a connection to and through something that I had only truly understood for myself when he was first born. He was only eight, but he had a thirty-year head start on emotional maturity, it seemed.

That said, he was still just a kid. Trying to have a discussion about his art always proved interesting. 

"Oh, did you find a new color, Jamie? What is it?!"

"Organge!"

"You mean, *orange*?"

"Nope!"

You get the idea. He was a character with character, and I couldn't have asked for anything more...

...But more we certainly received. One day, we noticed the lights in our house were emitting purple light instead of white. Hours were spent checking every bulb in the house, calling the electric company, doing research on wiring, what have you. Yet the answer remained in plane sight. Laying on the coffee table was one of Jamie's drawings. It was our living room, but instead of white light...you guessed it. 

"So, you're the source of the purple, eh buddy?"

"It's plurple!"

We asked him to draw a 'normal' version of our living room, and sure enough, the lights returned to their normal white hue. 

We kept closer attention to his drawings after that, naturally, to make sure he didn't turn our water red or make us look like we were auditioning for the Blue Man Group. There was a fine line between allowing him to explore his mind and breaking reality, but we managed it well enough.

Life continued, until word came that it would soon be ending. The Hero Council announced that the end was nigh. They said they had been aware of a problem with our universe for some time, but were only just announcing it after years of failed attempts at finding a fix. "We've simply no more options. We've all tried everything we know - energy pulses, time dilation, shadow universes - it simply didn't matter. We're so sorry; we just can't turn water into wine."

*But what if you could turn it plurple,* I thought to myself. 

I rang up representatives of the Council, and told them about my son's burgeoning power. I wasn't sure if it even mattered, or if my mind was reading too much into the wording of their announcement. But, we were all going to die, anyway, so why not?

The Council came to meet Jamie, and to see if he could be of some use. One of the representatives gave him a little test. "Jamie, could you paint me? But could you make me pink?"

Jamie's face lit up at the question, as he knew pink was usually kept as a color for special occasions as there had once been an incident with the dog. He eagerly agreed, and began to carefully draw the representative with his painted fingers. 

"Prink man!" he shouted upon completion. And sure enough, a large, pink figure now inhabited our living room.

"That'll do," the rest of the Council agreed. They said they weren't positive, but they believed that Jamie held what was left of the universe's supply of hope. "You see, our universe is running out of, well, white. We're not sure how or why it's happening, but stars at the very edge of the universe have already gone out as they can no longer produce white light, for whatever reason. Even attempting to understand the problem has evaded us. And frankly, we had no reason to ever believe we would. Jamie here, if what you've told us is correct, might be able to fix all this, or at least cover it up, in a sense. We just need him to draw the universe."

Astonished, all I could offer them was a joke. "I hope you like plurple."

"We'll take it, if it means we get to exist."

As the Council left our house, Jamie continued to draw away. "Bye prink man!" he said happily. In all the excitement, we had all somehow forgotten that a large hot pink government agent was among us. Jamie quickly fixed it before they did leave the house, but I guess that was simply the nail in the coffin. 

My son was going to be a hero.

Over the next few months, Jamie spent most of his days in a government warehouse, finger painting the universe. Star by star he made his way through; purple dots in a black indifferent universe. Until finally, he reached ours. The Earth was bathed in purple, and for now at least, we were saved. Against all odds, and without even really knowing how or why it worked at all, we were going to survive.

Back at our house, Jamie never even seemed to know that he was a hero. And if he did, he didnt care; he was too busy painting. His simple, humble passion had saved all known existence, but now he only cared about getting the right shape on his bananas. 

And on our fridge, hung a now old drawing that had proven to be prophetic, of a lamp emitting purple light.The original prompt:

"Wow! What are the odds that we were both foreigners in Zagreb for university at the same time, and somehow never met!" *I think she might be the one. Well, I mean she's the* ***one*** *but she's just so amazing.*

&nbsp;

"I know! To think we've somehow missed out on over a decade of friendship, purely by chance. But, at least we have right now. *I wonder if loving him to death would count as fulfillment of the job...*

&nbsp;

"What did you say is your occupation, again? I mean, it's even more  unlikely that we would have stumbled upon each other like this in Moscow of all places!" *Life is a cruel game, isn't it. Meeting your other half, only to have to kill her...where is the justice?!*

&nbsp;

"I'm a ballerina, in town for a handful of shows before I move on to my next city. Too much of a whirlwind life it feels like, at times." *Finally someone I could settle down with, but he has to die...*

&nbsp;

"I bet you've killed every show you've ever done." *C'mon, you can think of a way out of this!*

&nbsp;

"Pardon my blushing, you're just too sweet! You're going to kill me with kindness if you keep this up." *He knows.*

&nbsp;

"No, I'm just an honest man! Sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. *She knows.*

&nbsp;

"Say, I was thinking, do you think maybe we could get out of here, John?" 

&nbsp;

"And escape into the night together to live a simple life that only follows the rhythm of the rising and falling of the sun in a corner of the world that is empty aside from the eternal presence of our love? Yes, Julia, I would love to get out of here with you."

&nbsp;

"Well, all I had in mind was going to get a drink because I didn't want the night to end, but I like your idea more. There's just one problem, John..."

&nbsp;

"We need to kill each other."

&nbsp;

"How can we ever build trust if we're constantly looking over our shoulder?"

&nbsp;

"You're with the risk, Julia. Or whatever your name really is."

&nbsp;

"Well then, what are we waiting for! Let's disappear."The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

I wasn't typically in the business of stealing treasures with a heartbeat, but every thief has their price. My strange new client offered me the world; who was I to refuse such an offer?

The first thing I noticed about him, even before I knew his name. were the scars on his hands. As my hands bore the familiar shades of purple and blue - the 'paint of the trade' we used to say - I assumed my patron a fellow thief. But to my greatest of surprises, he was The Prince. 

To my still further surprise, he was what I was to steal. With untold wealth, incomparable access, and an unbound imagination, the Prince persuaded me to accept his offer. The only item he didn't offer was the Why. But I was happy enough to work within the gray areas of the world. I might even say it was my preference.

And so I stole the Prince. Under the cover of night and the pretense of transporting a fugitive, we made our way down The King's Mountain, and into the valley of possibilities. It was quite an easy escape, as neither of us even had to lie. But more difficult escapes awaited us yet.

The Prince was slow as honey. I had tried to explain to him that a thief in slow motion is merely a criminal ready to be caught, but we could not change our pace. I kept nagging, merely to keep him from being complacent, until he finally offered that his feet had been broken on several occasions, and this was the best he could offer. I bit of clarity came as to why one so noble would choose such a low road. But I kept my questions to myself, as other matters at hand held more urgency.

We came upon the Peasant's Wall, a highly guarded boarder meant to keep the commoners both in and out. We needed to pass through in order to reach our goal - the Eastern Tides, where the Prince could sail to the unknown. After some time spent planning, there was but one way through. In order to make our relationship appear genuine, the Prince would have to suffer. As he would have been easily recognized by the guardsmen, I had to make him unrecognizable. He told me he could endure the pain, and with reluctance I gave him two, swollen black eyes.  

As we went through the gate, the guardsmen congratulated me on 'putting the scum in his place.' The Prince had no response, but part of me was sure he felt that insult in a deeper way. 

We found ourselves several days journey past the wall, with what was our final true challenge before us. The Deathly Pass. And unoriginal title to be sure, but it was an honest one. The chances of death were high, and the only bet was whether the boulders or the people would crush you first. The Prince, in his knowledge of the kingdom, knew of a shortcut, however. Well, it was longer, but much safer. 

It was on this last leg of our journey that the Prince could finally talk again, but still he didn't say much. But he offered me something more - something I realized we hadn't had in all our relationship - eye contact. Though still swollen and bruised, he gave me a glimpse into his soul. And it was then that I knew how deep his trust in me went, and how our time together had moved beyond a mere business transaction.

Our long shortcut dumped us close to the shore, and we made our way to a ship that flew an unknown flag. He paid his boarding fee, and offered me the rest of the money he had. It was more than I had attained in all my years thieving put together. He said he didn't need it where he was going - who knew what money even meant, there. I took a moment to look back at the tunnel we had just popped out of, and memories of our journey from the other side came rushing back.

And so I came to my decision. I took the Prince's money, and went and paid my boarding fee. The Prince, quiet as ever, appeared stunned, and more than a little confused. "Friends don't abandon each other." was all I could offer. The prince let out a tear, of a different kind to which he was accustomed. He gave me an awkward smile, as he was apparently out of practice.

And then it was time. We boarded our ship, took one last look at the land from which we came, and we sailed into the unknown, together.The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

I had just given a presentation that brought humanity hundreds of years forward in their aim to achieve time travel. The applause went on for twenty-five minutes, but I had disappeared inside myself within the first. *None of these people get it. They're sheep, and I'll always be their shepherd. I just want to be known,* was all I could think to myself. 

I still stayed and signed signatures for hours, but it all felt so empty. With every loop on the 'L', with every dot on an 'i', the cynic in me was loud. *Another picture of you! Sitting on a shelf, collecting dust! A framed memory of the idea of a man they wish they could be, but never truly want to know!* Nobody asking for my name cared enough to ask how I was. It was all just another reminder of how lonely it can be on the leading edge.

I arrived back home in the wee hours of the morning. Quietly walking through a house full of the treasures of the world. Ancienty papyrus containing some of man's earliest written thoughts. Dinosaur fossils, reminders of a simpler, more awe-inspiring world. Letters written between famous authors, discussing the trials and inspirations of their time. And it was all worthless. 

There was nothing I could own that could express who I was. I had collected all these trinkets to remind myself of other times - to distract from the fact that nobody of my own time could relate. But all I found were reminders of how little all preceding generations really knew; how little they could achieve within their times. And so they became further reminders, that nobody had ever existed who could truly understand who I was. 

Except me.

I had left out one key piece of information from my presentation earlier in the evening. I had already done it - I had already achieved time travel. I had built and tested the machine, even. It was in my bedroom closet. I had spent many nights simply staring into it, gazing into the pale blue light, dreaming about stepping through. But I had a duty.

Even though humanity had nothing to offer me, I knew I had *a lot* to offer them. Mostly, I was just helping them find ways to keep from destroying themselves - which as you might know, is quite a difficult fear. And so I waited. I offered them all I could - led them as far as I could go. Until my final presentation. My greatest gift for them: a goal. I knew it could be done as I had already achieved it. 

And now the night had come. I rigged my machine with a small self-destruct utility - nothing as crude as a bomb, of course - to go off after its next trigger. And I left a note: "Come find me, when you're ready."

And then I walked into my closet - to find myself in a different time, and for the first time in my life, be known.The original thread:

&nbsp;

"Hey Baxter, could I...have a treat?" 

Baxter rolled his eyes, and furrowed his furry brow.

"Okay hooman, but this is the last one! You'll get a tummy ache on our walk later if you're too full!"

"Thanks Baxter! You're the best."

As Baxter's hooman ran off to get his treat, he reflected on their lives together and the strange situation they now found themselves in. 

*He always told me I was a good boy. But who could've known his salvation depended on it.* 

Off in the distance, the hooman waved at Baxter as he devoured his cookie. Baxter's tail waved back as they shared a moment they had many times before, in a world now far in the past.


Later, on their walk, the hooman joined Baxter in his reflective state. "Baxter, why am I here? I was never exceptional - I wasn't even good, obviously. The other people here tell me we get sent here because our dogs wanted us to be. Is that true?"

"It is, hooman. When I got here, it felt really...empty. Something was wrong. I couldn't even get myself to play with the other dogs. Do you know what it takes for us to *not* play?"

"I vaguely remember."

"Anyway, one day a memory came to me. You were throwing me a frisbee. And I knew why I felt so alone, why this place felt so distant. There was no good hooman to throw me *my* frisbee."

"You were easy to love, Baxter. You were the goodest boy, even when you were a puppy. You have no idea how hard it was to live the last 60 years of my life without you."

"I do, hooman. I do know that pain."

"What do you mean?"

"In order to bring our humans here, we have to venture to the very edges of heaven. We have to see your soul as it drifts upward, otherwise you'll float past our realm. I had to bark at you as you passed, otherwise you'd be gone."

"So you sat there for 60 years? Just waiting? For me?"

"I did." 

"Buddy...why? Why didn't you go live? This is a great place! You could have done anything!"

"I told you already. I missed you. I wanted to be your good boy again. You were worth waiting for."

"You were, well I guess are, the best friend I ever had." 

"And you mine, hooman."

"Say, should we go to the park? Play some fetch?"

"Okay!" 

And the two ran off as they had so many times before, a good boy and its hooman. A beaming smile on the man's face, and a furiously wagging tail on the dog's, as they ran off to play for the rest of eternity.The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

As the cloaked figure charged toward me it was clear it had but one motive: to erase me. I had known for some time that my physical body would pass away, so my only hope lay within the blind mystery of what would come next, if anything. But once I saw the true ferocity, vitriol, and anger of death, I knew something more was on the line. Not only would I be dead, but I'd be removed from the record of the universe. I'd be forgotten as if I was never there.

Despite death's speed, time seemed to move slow and I found myself content. What more could I do? The arena was empty, aside from me and death. I was here on its terms, not mine. I wasn't a fighter in my life, and saw no point to it in death. We all have a fate; this was just mine.

Behind me I heard the creaky machinations in the wall raise a gate to the center of the arena. I assumed it was only death's counterpart; another entity to speed this little show up a bit. But to my surprise, a familiar and safe voice called out to me.

"Andrew!" shouted the best friend I'd ever had. Scott and I grew up neighbors, then became friends, stayed friends, and were college roommates until I fell I'll. But even then, he practically lived with me in the hospital. He'd always had more hope, even more than me, that I would eventually recovery. In turn, his heart broke worse than mine when that hope proved empty. But here he was once more, somehow once more at my side.

"How did you get here, Scott?! Are you...please tell me you aren't dead, too..." I asked.

"No, we're not dead. We're not really sure how we got here, to be honest. But it seems like we each have a final gift for you. One last thread of love to clothe you in your time of need."

"We?"

I then heard the sound of more feet approach from behind. The rest of my family were here, somehow. 

"You all have to leave! It's not safe. What if death takes you as a bonus prize?"

"We'll be fine," my father said. "Now here, put these on. They were always your favorite."

My father tossed me my burgundy Converse shoes. I shed a tear as I remembered the birthday when I received them, and how loved and whole I had felt that day. I put them on, and felt a little piece of that long lost wholeness fill me once more.

"And don't forget this!" my mom shouted. It was the cap for my high school baseball team. I was terrible, but none of the other players cared. We were a small band of brothers; a true team, greater than the sum of its parts. Even its weak ones.

My grandparents were too shaken to speak, but they handed me a small blanket I used whenever I stayed at their house as a child. It was covered in cartoon lion cubs, because I was 'their little cub' as they used to say. But whenever I'd fall asleep beneath its warmth, my grandmother would always whisper "Sleep well, my brave lion," as I'd drift off to sleep. Bravery, which had long since hidden itself from me, returned all at once.

Then finally, Scott patted me on the shoulder. His eyes red with tears, he pulled off the old tattered hooded sweatshirt he was wearing, and told me to put it on. "Remember when you gave this to me, Andrew, when my dad died? How I told you that night that I felt so cold and exposed and like I'd never feel safe again? You gave me that hoodie as a reminder that I wasn't alone. That I could feel safe. And that I was loved. Now, I give it back to you. Death is going to defeat you; we cannot stop it from winning. But you will be safe; you won't be forgotten. You will be loved."

With tears all around, my friend and my family made their way back from where they came. The machinations in the wall again proved a temporary distraction. But soon, it was just me and death once more.

Time seemed to hasten, and my end approached quickly. But I looked down at my once pitiful body, and was at once reminded of the strength I truly had. Not within myself, necessarily, but in those that knew me best; those that love me deepest. And as death finally put its bony hands around my throat to take me into whatever came next, all I could do was smile. I began to fade away and who I once was seemed to slip beyond view. But it didn't matter anymore.

Death would not win. I wasn't going to be erased. What comes next remains unknown, but what once was remains solid as ever, because I will be remembered.The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

I had come back to my childhood home to take care of my mom while she was slowly dying. The very end stages of pancreatic cancer; brutal stuff, and I didn't want her to feel alone. But she spent most of my time there sleeping, so I had freedom to rummage through old boxes and the like. 

I had been staying in the living room in case she needed me to get something, but one day I decided to take a look at my old room. Half of it had been taken over by storage, but half of it remained as it was when I was a kid. Posters on the wall, small Lego constructions on the desk, old baseball glove in the corner. I even decided to plop down on my old bed, just like I used to. It felt as it always did, aside from the cloud of dust rising around me, but I had also hit my head on something hard. 

I reached under the pillow, and found a large bound book. *Mark's Deep Thoughts*, it said on the cover. *I don't remember this...* I thought to myself. But I opened it up, and it sure looked like my style. 

However, the stories were...off. There was a certain familiarity to them, but they were wrong. For example: 

&nbsp;

*March 23rd, 1998:*

*I failed my Spanish test today. But Lucy Hendersen winked at me so it was still a pretty awesome day.*

&nbsp;

But instead, I remembered passing my German class and being deathly afraid of Lucy. I was only 11, and girls were still scary. But apparently I was...wrong? I kept reading, to try and get my bearings.

&nbsp;

*September 8th, 2002*

*I decided not to even register for driver's ed. Where am I gonna go in a small town like this? I can bike to the Taco Bell; what else even is there?*

&nbsp;

This, I don't know, version of me, was an idiot. I didn't even care for Taco Bell - I was a Wendy's guy, which was clear on the other side of town, and was one of the reasons why I *did* want to drive. Who doesn't want to drive, anyway? 

I was somehow both confused and angry, as well as deeply unsettled. Had I somehow lived two lives that contradicted each other? All I could do was keep reading, and see if whoever was wrote this would explain themselves.

&nbsp;

*October 30, 2009*

*Sometimes, it feels like I'm all split up. Like I was fractured somewhere along the line, and wasn't put together quite right. I'm just so lonely, and I think I'm losing myself, too. If I was divided, I hope those parallel versions of me are happy, at least.*

&nbsp;

I remember being depressed in college, but I definitely never wrote that. I was too scared to talk about it; I never would have recorded it in a place it could be found. But, maybe he, or I, whatever, was on to something. Maybe I was one of his fractures. Would I be real, then? This sure felt real. But who knows.

I kept flipping and browsing through the book, idly looking for answers while my mind was in a different world. Until I noticed, that there was a page with an entry for tomorrow.

&nbsp;

*September 24th, 2019*

*Mom died today. Once it was in her pancreas, we knew it was just a matter of time. I feel...numb. I remember feeling this way, once, when I was in college. Like I was fracturing, and pieces of me were scattered. Maybe they'll escape this sorrow; I sure hope so, anyway.*

&nbsp;

I dropped the book on the bed, spawning another cloud of dust to rise around me. It somehow felt appropriate. I wasn't any closer to knowing what was going on, but I was confident I knew what was coming. In all the confusion and all the impossibility of the situation, I felt like I had been given a gift. I no longer had to wonder when my mom would go, or worry about missing her while I slept. I knew I was going to get to be with her, and ensure she knew she was loved.

I slid the book back under the pillow for safe keeping, just as I heard her cough echo up from the stairs below. And so I went to be with her, for those last few hours.The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

*Ugh, this headache. What happened? Why does it smell like burnt hair? Okay, well, guess I should start cleaning up, get these bottles in the recycling. But first, gotta get my eyes to focus.*

*Why is my arm so blue? There's too many zeroes. Stupid eyes messing with me still. Wait, no, that's right. What am I going to do for the next seven hundred million lifetimes? I'm already bored, and I'm only on year 22 of my first one. Need to find a less headache inducing hobby, I guess.*

*But, how is this even possible? I passed out next to a fire pit. How could I have saved anyone, let alone the planet. I would have had to save the planet, right? Yeah, yeah, math is coming back to me now. Damn, how'd my hands get so scratched up? And is that a bite mark? Can't even pick up these bottles properly right now. So how'd I save the planet again?*

*Okay, who was there last night. Bry-bread, Dudeski, Raisin Brandon...was it just the four of us? Ugh, must be. Four chairs out here. Makes sense. So if I saved them, that's what, four months of extra life? Nah, I'm missing something....wait, phone's ringing.*

"Hey Byran, what's up?"

"Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuddy, do you remember getting attacked last night?" 

"Huh? What? I wasn't attacked. We were just drinking. Little too much, I guess - can't remember much of all, really."

"You might want to turn on the news, guy."

"Okay...."

"...the CDC asks any raccoon sightings be reported immediately, as they have been told an infected animal carrying a strange mutation - an early form of zombism, some are calling it..."

*The scratches. The burning hair.*

"You threw that thing in the fire last night, Chad. Good job, buddy! You're a hero!"

"It bit me, Bryan..."

"..."

"I gotta go."

*Well. At least I know what I'll be doing for one of the next seven hundred million lifetimes. Test subject wasn't what I had in mind, but at least it should be interesting.*The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

It was the silence that first clued me into something being amiss. We were the first ship and crew to ever attempt a mission like this; why was I the only one who seemed excited? Or rather, why was I the only one who even seemed to notice?

I decided to go to the bridge, to hopefully get a glimpse of space as we traveled. Maybe that would excite a little glee in these suddenly stoic pillars of flesh. 

Along my way, I would occasionally pass one of my colleagues, but they each carried the same, eerie silence about them. A simple nod, and then they would whisk past me. I tried to break the silence myself, once, but I got no response. Even stranger, it seemed like they didn't even understand me.

I continued my trek, and pondered over the situation. *How well do I really know these people?* I questioned to myself. I was a later addition to the crew, but during the training and preparation for our flight, I thought everyone to be so jovial. But thinking back on it, I couldn't remember the face of anyone in particular that I had spoken to. In any case, I was sure the captain would have answers for me.

I was almost to the bridge, but at this point it felt like the silence was actively fighting against me. I hadn't seen anyone in quite some time, I realized. A mild panic started to build inside of me, as it felt that all rationality had somehow been left behind. "Guess these engines are more powerful than I thought!" I spoke to myself, both to break the silence and return myself to a bit of reality.

I finally made it to the bridge. It was there that any semblance of knowledge I had about the universe was undone. Everyone present on the bridge was melting. They stood at their stations, but they appeared as melted candles. Except for the captain.

"Ah, Ensign James, you made it."

The voice shattered the silence like a brick through a window.

"Made it to...what, exactly?"

"Your prize, ensign. The ship. The future. Space. It now belongs to you."

"But, I'm only an ensign. I don't know anything. In fact, I think I know less now than when I first got on the ship."

"With time, ensign. It will come. But we will be leaving soon, which means you should go by your proper title. Captain James; sounds nice, doesn't it?"

"Who, where, what are you going?"

"Stumbling over your words a bit, Captain James - better get your nerves under control! But I suppose it's understandable. Anyway, me and my people from a different time, a different place. We're a generous people, who like to give grand gifts. We stumbled across your planet in one of our planning meetings, and decided to give you this ship and its engine as a way of unlocking the universe for you. As for the strange appearance of the others,  we're phasing back into our time as we approach light speed."

"But I- I'm going to get lost. I don't know how to fly a ship. I don't even know where the brakes are."

"You'll find a way, Captain James. That's why we chose you. Everything you need to know is built into the ship, you just need to learn how to use it. You're the owner of the greatest gift your people will ever receive; we know you'll use it well."

And with that, the former captain melted away all at once, and he and the rest of his...uh, people, I guess, disappeared. The deafening silence returned, and I was alone.

&nbsp;

*Captain Stewart James' Log: Day 1*The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

When I awoke, I found myself in a large, transparent sphere. As you might imagine, I found this quite perplexing, as I wasn't even sure what planet I was on. I had a vague memory of an impact, but beyond that I was at a loss.

The creatures were bipedal in nature, but much larger than anything else I had experienced in my journeys across the expanse. Initially, I found them to be quite intimidating. The sounds they produced were very low, but could also be very high on occasion. It seemed that every time I came to a conclusion about their nature, a contradiction would arise that would blanket me in fresh confusion.

For some time they kept me in the strange sphere that had become my home. *If I could get back to my ship, maybe...* I would often find myself dreaming. I wasn't sure if or what was left of my ship, but I was now much more confident of its impact. Alas, I was stranded.

The large pink beings seemed quite smitten with me, for whatever reason. Often they would walk past my enclosure, and make their strange sounds at me. "N...m...," whatever that meant. It took me some time to learn the patterns of their speech, but those sounds were near universal, though in context remained mysterious.

Time for them was very measured and consistent. Consistency is a valuable commodity in the rest of the universe, which made my situation even more unfortunate. I could have prospered greatly if only I'd been able to harvest this planet. But instead, I was a prisoner.

Many of their cycles came and went, and slowly I learned their sounds and their words. Eventually they moved me into a large 'square.' It was rather cluttered with strange objects and unfamiliar foliage, but with time I adjusted. A reluctant home, this world became.

And so, I've now reached the final stages of my life. I record this message in both my native language and my learned 'Terran Tongue,' written upon the fabric of the universe, that someday my people may find it and read of my fate. Should others come, perhaps you may find record of me in an the archives of what the pink beings call "sea creatures." And with any luck, find my name among the many.

For Colonel Jameson's immediate review,

&nbsp;


The first few seconds of the charge were nothing but a blur. With our adrenaline high, our voices at peak volume, and our bravery having reached dangerous levels of intensity, we weren't in any condition to process what we were seeing. Our attention to the moment only truly returned when we realized we weren't seeing anything at all. 

The battle-cries lowered, and our sprint slowed to a mere jog, as questions started to populate our minds. "Where is everyone?" Grimwald asked. 

We were positive the enemy was here. Every bit of intelligence we had received informed us that a large army lay just outside of our position. We charged East with nothing but the most assured of confidences that our strike was sound. And yet, nothing.

"Hold on, I think I see movement up ahead." Hughes said.

"What...*what is that*?" Grimwald asked, confirming that some force was headed our way.

Now the silence was complete as we waited for whatever new tactic our enemy had prepared for us. We readied ourselves for this mystery battle as best we could. As the opposing force drew near, a methodical, consistent, almost pleasant rattling noise filled the air. And then, we saw them.

The first corps was small; only a handful of individuals led the way. But behind them, the rest of their army began to crest the hill. It was the truest form of shock and awe we had ever experienced, and no training or experience or intelligence could have ever prepared us for what we were seeing.

Hundreds upon hundreds of dachshunds. 

A sea of four legged dogs flowed determinedly in our direction. Their tiny legs taught well how to march; their ranks sturdy, and their uniforms crisp. Each dog equipped with a luger, for whatever reason. The gentle clang of their guns now became louder as they approached. 

For several moments, no other sounds were made. Our shock was thorough, and our confusion ran deep. Our enemy was not scared, and let out not a single bark. And soon, their ranks stopped progressing, aside from the small squad at the front - they continued on their path, apparently acting as some kind of delegation.

"Grimwald, Hughes, go out and, uh, meet them. See if they carry a note, or some other form of message." I said.

"Not a chance, Lewis! Those are fascist dogs!"

"What?! Are you kidding me, Hughes?"

"I mean, well, they have to be, right? They're the enemy! They're carrying lugers! They must have been sent by Hit-"

"They don't even have thumbs, Hughes," I shockingly had to remind him. "Look, we have no other options. If they are, uh, evil, they still have us outnumbered so they'll kill us if they want to. Now go, find out what that delegation wants."

Grimwald and Hughes slowly advanced toward the small squad of dogs that were now just a few hundred yards away. We were now locked in to whatever this was. No retreat, and no going forward. Just a solemn meeting in the middle to determine all of our fates. 

Time seemed to slow to a crawl as the two parties slowly advanced. Finally they met. From my distance, it looked as though nothing was taking place. Grimwald and Hughes stood cold and aloof; the dogs sat with confidence and resolve, tails gently wagging. Again time seemed to slow as each party waited for the other's first move. Until finally, one of the enemy dachshunds flopped over, its tail wagging greatly increased.

"Sir, I think it wants us to, um, pet its belly?" Hughes yelled back to me.

No sooner had Hughes finished his sentence when the rest of the lead squad of dogs also flop over, apparently excited at the idea of being petted. 

Within a short amount of time, each soldier had six or seven of the enemy dogs at their feet, tails wagging vigorously at the thought of attention. But I stayed back. Something still wasn't sitting right; it was all too easy, too fun, too *cute*. 

*Are these good boys, or are they fascists?* I kept asking myself over and over. 

Four days went by in our makeshift camp, as the dog army had kept us from both retreating and advancing as more and more of their troops began to surround us. It wasn't much longer until we finally got our answers. 

Our tired troops after a full day of fetch proved easy prey. Amid all the distraction we had no knowledge of the human troops approaching from the West. They struck in the night, and we soon found ourselves prisoners. 

It's with great urgency and secrecy I write this letter, in the hopes that other battalions be aware of this new tactic from our enemy. They have shown us the horrors of war in its truest sense, to which I fear we have become desensitized. So they now turn the fight to a different emotional front, knowing our weakness for all things adorable. To respond with violence toward another man is now commonplace; but to do so toward a dog truly tests the boundaries of our depravity, and shows the enemy knows no such limit.

Beware the fascist dogs,

Every day as I walked down the hallway to be let outside for recess, the same message would appear above the door in bright flashing letters: *Brad the Bully*. Every day as those doors opened, I let out a heavy sigh, feeling as though I had already lost the fight.

Brad was the biggest five year old you'd ever seen. A brick with arms and legs, but somehow as agile as the wind. He'd appear in an instant and disappear just as quick, always leaving me in a heap of arms and legs, bruised and defeated. 

The worst part of this experience was knowing that Brad wasn't even real. He was my boss and mine alone for this stage of my life. As my mind grew in wisdom even though I stayed the same age, Brad was always there with me. Or rather, was there pushing me to the ground. But all the same, we'd spend more than two decades together, intertwined in a battle that kept us both prisoners.

I had spent the last few years more less indifferent to this fate. Spending twenty years losing the same battle takes a toll on one's confidence, and eventually it becomes impossible to see beyond the failure. But I did try at first - oh did I try! I'd spend days, then weeks, then months, plotting and scheming to find a way to overcome my foe. But he was always too strong, too swift, too smart. Somehow. No matter would I did, he would always have an answer.

And so one night I lay in my tiny bed, reflecting on the life I'd lived and all I'd never get to see beyond those schoolyard walls. I didn't know how much longer this would go on. I was hopeful that it would eventually end; that my time would run out, and some kind of comically 'Game Over' or the like would appear. But it never came. 

As some of my feelings poured themselves out in my tears, I had a singular moment of clarity. Or rather, for a brief moment I could see through the clutter in my mind. And from the fringes of my memory a picture began to arise. It was of those painful, familiar school doors. *Brad the Bully* sparkling above, as ever, but this time in the far upper right corner there was some kind of...icon? A small box, with a question mark in it. *Is that real? How have I never seen this before?* was all I could think.

The rest of that night was filled with a feeling I hadn't known in quite some time: excitement. Perhaps this was a way out! If nothing else, it gave me a hope. It was something new, and in this so often repeated and monotonous existence, new was as good as gold.

I didn't catch a wink of sleep that night, and was on the edge of my seat all morning as I waited for the next recess to come. I played it cool, just in case Brad was somehow watching, and would snuff out my hope before I had a chance to lose it myself. 

Soon, it was time. As I watched down the hallway, the familiar mockery of my boss descended. I searched in quiet panic for what my memory had shown to me, and sure enough, in the far upper right corner hiding in the shadows sat the icon. I focused all my energy on it, not quite sure what I was supposed to do. In a last gasp effort, I screamed *Open!* in my mind. And to my surprise, it worked.

*Helpful Hints! "Kill With Kindness"*

"That's it?!" I yelled in my tiny voice. The teachers chaperoning us looked toward me in confusion. I said nothing, and continued to march my small legs forward, as I pondered what this meant. 

I sat myself on a swing, and pulled a piece of candy from my pocket. I had accidentally pulled out another piece without realizing it, so my thoughts were distracted by the gentle plop of the candy upon the wood chips. I stared at it for a moment without thinking much of it before picking it up. But as I held it in my hands, I had a thought. *I wonder if Brad likes candy.*

And so, for the first time in years, I was the one to seek him out. I scanned the schoolyard looking for my old foe, eventually spotting him behind a large oak. Slowly, I made my way over. I yelled "Hey, Brad!" and the half-boy-half-brick turned, and began cracking his knuckles. He started a slow march toward me. Our battle was now imminent.

As he drew close, I clenched my fist, unsure if I had the right idea or if this was going to be my final beating. But this was my only way - nothing else worked, and under the stress of necessity, I called out one last time. "I thought you might want some candy."

Now standing only a few feet a way, Brad's demeanor changed in an instant. His grim face now soft, his hard hands now relaxed, and his natural intimidation gave way to an almost kind presence. He took the piece of candy from me, popped it in his mouth, stared at me in awkward silence while he ate it, and then smiled. With a gentle laugh he exclaimed "Well done!" and above his head descended a new sign. *Stage Cleared!* 

I went to sleep that night beaming in my victory. Finally, I had found freedom. But there was also a tinge of loss. I knew when I went back to school the next day, or next week, or even next month, my new boss would make himself known. But I would never see Brad again.The original prompt:

The numbers played on repeat in my mind as I made my way to the detention hall, where all the losers would be processed after the winning combination was announced. The streets are eerily quiet, as they always are on selection nights. Some use what is likely their final walk to reflect; weigh the balances of their life and come to terms with fate. Some feign confidence and became near caricatures of themselves in their excitement. But most, like myself, seek distraction and fine solace in the cold truth of numbers.

&nbsp;

Every now and then a memory would squeak through my mental barriers. Emotions are often irrational, but when faced with an even more irrational end, they seek for justification. *Why did mom buy a ticket?* I found myself wondering. *Didn't she realize how much we'd suffer?* my thoughts pestered. "I hate her," I mumbled under my breath, not really even paying attention to what I was thinking. Raw anger had bubbled up in a moment of weakness. So, I fled back to my only source of serenity.

&nbsp;

*3-91-6-0-71*

&nbsp;

Rationality returned, if only briefly. I knew I didn't hate her. I knew why she made her choice. I knew she had mouths to feed, and clothes to provide, and even the faint hope of Christmas presents. And we all knew there was only one way. We had come to peace with our likely separation, and cried our goodbyes as a family. That now felt so long ago, as I was the only one of us left. A family of five now one. A single mouth to feed, a single body to clothe. And yet, the same undying desperation. There was only one chance for people like me, and it loomed just up the road.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A quieter room you'd have been hard pressed to find. A few hundred people all sat around a single screen, waiting their collective fates. Officers with hoods and cuffs rimmed the large hall, but I doubt few even noticed. The eerie silence from outside now further intensified, as even those confident caricatures had to come to terms with their reality. More likely than not they would die with the rest of us. If anyone did speak it was only to utter one last morbid joke. "I wonder how far my head will roll," and the like.

&nbsp;

*3-91-6-0-71*

&nbsp;

The screen flickered on, and an indifferent man in a suit stood before the lottery balls that sealed our fates. Without pomp and introduction, he simply read the first ball as rolled down the tube.

&nbsp;

*3*

&nbsp;

The tears began to flow as many were already good as dead. The officers started shuffling, and soon faces became only memories as they disappeared into hoods.

&nbsp;

*91*

&nbsp;

Still more screeched, as I could only sit in silence. *Is it safe to start hoping?*

&nbsp;

*6*

&nbsp;

For the first time in months I started to feel alive. I no longer felt the emptiness of my stomach as my blood began to race. 

&nbsp;

*0*

&nbsp;

I couldn't believe it. I was going to win! All the heartache would prove worth it, as at least I'd be able to keep our family name alive and hope for better days ahead. I started picturing the sandwich I was going to buy. It's the little things...

&nbsp;

*70*

&nbsp;

A cry of joy from across the room felt a mile away, as I felt the last piece of joy ripped from my heart and mind. Even the painful memories shattered into even sharper splinters. To be so close to salvation, only to end up in hell. 

An officer now loomed above. With my hands sealed behind my back, I watched a single face in the crowd cry tears of joy amid a small sea of black hoods. It seemed a fitting last memory; a helpful summary of this cruel world. I chuckled to myself for reasons I'm not entirely sure.

Soon my world was dark, locked in my hood, as I was marched down some unknown hall to find the guillotine with my name on it. I'd made peace with my fate sometime ago, and any semblance of anger or sadness was ripped out along with my hope just a few minutes prior.

We soon turned into the final room I'd ever enter. And even though the end of my life grew near, all I could feel was a certain level of thankfulness, as I'd finally know desperation no more.The original thread:

"Dad, that cloud looks like a puppy!"

These warm, long days are the highlight of my year. Hours spent in the park with Josh, lost in whatever world his imagination should build. Today, we watched the clouds, which all happen to be in the shapes of animals this time.

"Oh, look! A turtle!"

Of all our various activities, this one is always my favorite. It reminds me of the many days I spent outside as a youngster, otherwise alone save for the clouds. Those ethereal beings became my friends and carried my mind away to better places whenever I needed an escape. 

"Whooooaaaaa! Dad, LOOK! A dragon!"

Startled, I looked to where the little finger was pointing. *It can't be* I thought. *Hazaroth, is it you?* 

The most magnificent cloud I had ever known flew gently over the horizon in the distance. Even as a child, I had always believed my cloud friends lived in my imagination. They were very real to me, of course, but to the rest of the world, I assumed they were merely clouds like any other. 

But here before my son and I floated my old friend. The sharp wings, the tiny fangs, the almost friendly-looking puffs of his fiery breath. A crystal clear memory, alive before me. 

"That is a *very* cool dragon, Josh! I saw one when I was a kid, too. It could the same one, even!"

"WOW, really, dad? That's so cool! Do you mind sharing your dragon with me?"

"Not at all, son."

For the next several minutes, we talked about all the adventures Hazaroth has gone on. All the battles he had fought in, all the evil kings he had defeated, and all the princesses he must have escorted to safety. Indeed, he's the bravest dragon ever to have lived. As he grew closer, we cheered him on, to support him in whatever heroic journey he was currently undertaking.

As he drew nearer, his color turned grey, and it appeared he was turning into a rain cloud. "Oh, no! Do you think he's mad?"

"No, I think he's happy, Josh! I think he's heard us and knows that we're cheering him on. He knows he's loved. Even dragons can get emotional, you know."

"I'm glad he knows he's loved, papa. I bet he loves us, too!"

The dragon rained a short shower of tears. I don't know how, but I could tell that he recognized me. I could tell he was remembering those long days he and I spent together, sharing our battles. "He does love us, Josh. I'm sure of it."

The wind picked up, and my old friend drifted quickly across the sky. Soon, he was almost out of view. "What a cool day, dad. I hope we meet the dragon again someday!"

"Don't worry. We will."

*See you around, old friend.*The original prompt:

Everyone has their vices. For some, it's found in a bottle. For others, it's found in some form of drug that opens the doors to a different reality. Yet more common still, it is often found on a plate. The supple textures, the rich sauces, the wide array of preparations - all for that perfect bite of food. Or perhaps not even a perfect bite, as quantity devours quality for some. 

I suppose you could say I fall into the latter category. I, too, am always in search of that next perfect bite. I do admit to the occasional binge, where the thrill of the feast outweighs the importance of the flavor - what can I say, I'm only human. But more often than not, it's the presentation that calls forth my yearning to taste. There is something inherently pleasing about a person dressed well; their souls are always sweeter. 

I first discovered my vice by accident. A terrible tragedy at the local swimming pool, as one of my middle school classmates drown. I along with the rest of the children were wrecked with tears, until...I noticed that he was still there. Among those crowded around the body stood an apparition of the deceased. Curiosity drew me in, and my nose pushed me further. Something about his spirit smelled absolutely *divine.* It might sound silly, but my young brain only had one thought: *I wonder how it tastes.* 

Next thing I knew, I was inhaling my dead classmate like a vacuum. He screamed as he was dying once more, but his cries felt distant. I was entirely wrapped up in the beautiful taste of soul, and nothing else mattered in that moment. I was set on a path with implications I didn't yet know, but it was one I was happy to walk, in search of that delicious bite.

For many years, I tried to be innocent. I hoped for more accidents, more tragedies, to fulfill my needs. But rarely was I so lucky. I resisted the urge to kill for as long as I could, until my need for satisfaction was too great to bear. And so, I became a hunter, and I was very, *very* good.

I ate my way around the world, to see how each local cuisine differed from the last. Their souls shared a common taste, something inherently splendid, with only minor differences. Europeans a little richer, Americans a little salty, Australians a little dry. But all were wonderful, beautiful, delicious souls. The supply was good, and my hunger knew satisfaction, for the first time in my life. 

But alas, all good things must come to an end. I was eventually caught in the act, and the world used its power to unite against me its common foe. Thankfully, only a few of my many meals could be traced back to me, so I'm not destined for solitary. And truth be told, I don't mind my fate as a prisoner. I trust I won't have to exert much effort for a meal, and will still experience a nice diversity in taste. 

Yes, I think I will rather enjoy prison. And I can't get there fast enough! I am famished.The original prompt:

"Good morning, Todd."

He sounded exactly like I had always imagined he would. Which I suppose only makes sense, now that I think about it. But it's been a strange day, so you'll forgive me if I'm still actively processing a bit. 

I had been creating Andre Burroughs on and off for the last five years or so. Any time I went through a slump in confidence, or a bad break up, he would find the opposite taking place in his life. He always got the best promotion; he always got the girl. He had lived the life I wished to attain, but always knew was always beyond a horizon I'd never see.

But now, he was looking at me. Not as a character in my mind, but with his beautiful hazel eyes. Strangely, however, I didn't see joy, or confidence, or the glint of a well lived life. Instead, his eyes were filled with burden.

"Uh, Andre? Why are you here?"

"I've thought a lot about what you'd look like. You're the god of my world, Todd - the legendary creator of it all. I suppose you could say I started to question my existence, and somehow, that led me to you."

"Yeah, but *why*? Why would you even question your life? How could you, even; I haven't written that into your story line!"

"A lot happens when you close your notebook, Todd."

I guess I had never considered that. Again, why would I? 

"So, um, what can I do for you, Andre?" 

"I need a tragedy."

"Excuse me?!"

"Todd, do you have any idea the pressure I'm under? Do you have any idea how much the people who work for me hate me? I've been promoted every six months for the last three years, but I never actually work. You always have me traveling to Japan or Argentina or whatever. Nobody respects me, and they feel the injustice. They feel like background characters in their own lives."

"They are background characters!"

"But you created them with feelings, Todd. To you they're just standing around the water coolers gossiping about their sorrows. To them, they're real problems."

"How can I help that, Andre? Your story, it's so good, it's so interesting! If I wrote it differently..."

"I know, Todd. Remember, I come from your thoughts - I know why you've written me this way. You're trying to feel whole. But you need to know the cost. It's me. It's us. My world needs balance."

"So, what, I'm supposed to have you lose your job? Or hurt you somehow? But that wouldn't be believable because you're so...perfect."

"You just need to make me human, Todd."

"Why do you have to be so convicting, Andre?"

"Because you wrote me that way."

I felt like an idiot, fighting with my own mind, essentially. More than anything, I found myself being humbled. I don't know how I got here, but the weight of it all certainly became real. I had created the perfect monster, who happened to be made out of all the things I dreamed I could be.

"Okay. I'll have you lose your job, Andre. What do you want to do, now? Pilot? Naval captain? Biologist?"

"Potato farmer. A simple life. Maybe the occasional bad thunderstorm to give me practical challenges."

"Ugh, *fine*. I'll make some revisions tonight. Maybe you should go, I don't know, clean out your office or something."

"Sure, Todd. Thanks. If you need to talk, just let me know."

I blinked, and he was gone. I spent the day thinking and plotting, figuring out the alterations I needed to make to my story. But more than anything, I thought about the things I valued, and the horizons I thought were once far off. It turns out I had set myself up for failure, but not appreciating what was on the horizon in front of me. 

Andre Burroughs is now a moderately successful potato farmer, who is in the process of rebuilding his barn. It's hot, hard work. But at the end of the day, he goes to sleep a happy man. 

I think I might give the simple life a go myself. Maybe I'll find happiness, too.The original prompt:

After a brief moment of panic, another message appeared in the sky: "Good job!" Confusion begat even more confusion as I stood on my little peak, looking down at all I had fought through.

"Um. Thanks?" I yelled at the sky, feeling a bit silly. I waited for some minutes for some other sign, be it more words, or a person appearing out of nowhere, or a fighter jet to come shoot me out of existence. But nothing came. Only the gentle chatter of distant birds carried on the wind. So, I shrugged, and made my way forward.

I descended the mountain and found myself in front of a raging river. I had seen it from the peak, but there wasn't any way around it and I didn't want to turn around - I'd come too far. But now it seemed like I was going to have to swallow my pride and climb the mountain again in retreat. 

On the verge of giving up, another message appeared in the wilderness. Upstream I could see large letters somehow written in the water, flowing my way. Eventually, they made their way to me. "Run and jump!" The river was a good sixty feed across, so there was no chance I could clear it. But I had nothing to lose, and was still worried about the possibility of that fighter jet, so I did as the river told me.

I ran as fast as I could, and heaved myself as hard into the air as I ever had. Eyes closed, I waited for the inevitable splashdown, but the seconds went by and I remained comfortably dry. Opening one eye, I found myself gently floating through the air above the river. I tried speeding up the process by kicking my legs and moving my arms in a swimming motion, but to no avail. It was as though I were on tracks. It was very slow, and eventually I found myself quite bored, but there I sat until I landed on the bank.

I didn't waste time trying to figure out what was going on, because there was no chance I would get there. This was beyond my understanding. And besides, the whole point of this venture was to reconnect with nature. So, I took a big pine scented breath, and carried on my way.

Those next few days were peaceful, and none of the foliage or the trees or rocks or skies tried talking to me again. It was nice to just walk, and let everything else empty out of my brain for a while. I caught some fish, I played my harmonica, and I saw an eagle catch and decimate a squirrel. It was wonderful.

Soon, I approached the edge of the woods. Through the clearing, I could see another human standing on the beach of the lake ahead, to my great surprise. An average man in khakis and polo, he wasn't exactly someone you expected to find out here. I had a sense of what was coming next, as I stumbled onto the pebbly beach.

"Ah! 2374! Glad you made it. I was worried that river was going to stop you!"

"So, you sent the messages?"

"Yep! You passed all the tests, though. You were the only subject that took the initiative to actually get out. And you even went farther than we had hoped!"

Just then, I heard the sound of my old fear, and on the horizon saw the glint of metal wings.

"You are going to kill me, then."

"Oh, no, of course not! We're just destroying the lab, for good measure."

With pace faster than I expected, the planes soared overhead and made their way over the mountains I had originally climbed. Their missiles released, and I saw the plumes of the explosions slowly rise above the peaks.

"Didn't a lot of people live there?" I said.

"Not *real* people. Test subjects, like you. They can be rebuilt. But we already have you - you're the cream of the crop, and I think we'll learn everything we need by examining your logs. Come on, I'll show you to your new desk."

And so now I sit at a desk, recording my thoughts, as they study my 'brain' and how I make decisions for myself. It's a grind, but it's a life, I suppose. But I'm feeling that itch again, to go out and explore. Hopefully, they'll soon let me climb another mountain.The original prompt:

Life on Earth wasn't so long ago for some of us. Sure, I'm a true Martian in every sense of the word, but a few of us were born with grandparents who had vivid memories of their home world, and drew us in to their reality through their tales. 

"We would spend hours doing nothing at all. When it came down to it, existing together was the only goal. The shops, the fresh aromas of the rival coffee and tea companies, the random folks handing out surveys. It was all a spectacle, to be sure, but none of it really mattered. For your grandma and I, we were there simply to be - to learn each other's world, rather than the one around us. Well, aside from Cinnabon, of course. We both loved the smell of fresh cinnamon."

The tales were endless, but they always came back to the same place - that world within a world, where only my grandparents dwelt. It made me long to understand love in such a way, where the whole world melts around you. It's hard to see much of anything in the rusty dust of my existence. 

Earth wasn't off limits, of course, it was just dead. So when I did eventually get married, I propositioned my bride to be with an idea for a honeymoon.

"Want to go to the mall?"

It was an expensive trip, but we both knew it would be worth it. We had been caretakers for my grandparents in their last few years, so their experiences were ours, but we had always wanted to go deeper, And now was our chance. We'd only have a few hours, but they wouldn't be idle ones.

And so we were lowered into the mall, now buried by dust and decay. An old poster poking out of the dirt here and there, the glass boxes that once exhibited who knows what now sat empty, and the mechanical stairs only held memories of movement. But it was strangely beautiful. The quiet serenity was in itself quite nice, but really, we were seeing it with eyes not our own. Where we knew to be dust, we saw the beautiful plants that once were there. Where empty displays, we saw the colorful creativity that they once housed. And where we saw broken stairs, we saw the endless stream of feet that once flowed above them. 

And ultimately, we saw my grandparents, ignoring all of it. In the decrepit remains of the former food court, we could imagine all the bustling bodies looking for sustenance. And in the center sat gram and gramps, sharing a cinnamon roll, together finding the love that would sustain them across different worlds.

Before you knew it, our time was up, and we had to make our way back to the drop zone. But we had gotten more than our money's worth, and were now ready for the rest of our lives - whether they be on Mars or worlds yet unknown.

And as we lifted out, we remarked to each other, how the mall still smelled of cinnamon.The original prompt:

The void was a place where the phrase 'close but not quite' had never been more applicable. To describe it almost as a fabric is *close*, but it doesn't really capture it. To say it was actually quite warm and inviting nears the truth, but still falls short somehow. And to say it was alive is technically impossible, yet here I am to somehow tell you that it is. Almost.

From the moment I was dumped off in what I was told was inevitable, unending darkness, I somehow knew that wasn't the case. It was like I was a puzzle piece that fate was trying to jam into a position where it almost worked, but would eventually pop back out. I didn't know why, how, when, or where any of this would happen, but I had a deep, resolved confidence that it would.

After some unknown minutes, I started talking to myself, as I thought a little sound my help me process the situation. If nothing else, it would help break up the monotony of silence and keep me sane a little longer. "Okay, what did that council find me guilty of again? Did they ever actually say? It feels so long ago. Are they going to feed me? Wait, where do I go to the bathroom?"

It was that last rhetorical question that began me on my path to freedom. You see, as the words fell out of my mouth, they were met by an omnipresent giggle. 

Confused, I continued to question myself, but also had a feeling that other ears might be listening. "Um, did the void just giggle?"

More contained chuckling followed. I had just gone through some astonishing experiences, but this one was taking the cake. I was trapped in the void of eternal damnation and darkness, and it turns out the thing is alive. Kind of. If not alive, then it at least had a silly sense of humor...somehow.

"Um, should I call you Mr. Void?" A quiet rumbling beneath my feet was my only 'no.' 

"What about...Dr. Void?" Again the rumbling guided my inquiry.

"Maybe just 'Void'?" The rumbling was softer, but I was still missing something. It had been guiding me in a more personal direction, so I went for a long shot.

"How about I call you my friend?" The giggling returned, this time accompanied by a certain electricity in the air. 

"You don't get too many visitors, do you. Or at least not many who don't belong here, anyway." I kid you not, this time my new friend responded with something akin to whale noises. Again, close but not quite. 

My friend and I continued to converse and get to know each other. I eventually learned the more nuanced details of my friend's responses. How the most gentle changes in its rumblings could show various levels of displeasure. How the peaks of his joy could rise to unknown heights through the rich tones of the near-whale calls. How that electric tingling could both mean sorrow and delight, depending on the context I introduced. And to my shock, I felt empathy for the void. 

"Most of your visitors hold your existence against you, don't they," I mused during one of our conversations. The electricity told me I was right, but not in a way I wished to be. 

The void felt pain. It never wished itself to be the place of ultimate suffering; the location which fate deemed sufficient to place its worst criminals. It was its own entity, and it was being abused by a more powerful entity who didn't understand, or rather, likely didn't care.

It was in this moment that the void let me reach one of its boundaries. I couldn't see anything, but I felt it rub against my arm. It was like a nice, soft sweater, but not quite. I gave it a gentle pat, like I used to give my dog. The void let out a quiet whale noise, to which I hummed along. The void was different than me, but we had found common ground on which we could communicate. And I wanted it to know that I saw, and appreciated it for what it was.

And that was the final key. Almost like a draw-string bag opening, the void parted and light from the universe shown in. I knew I should leave, and that I was going to, but it still felt a rather sad departure than a happy one. The void had suffered, been given a friend, and was now letting that friend leave. But it was its choice, not mine, and so I walked into the light.

I awoke in my bed, under a dark starry night. I felt safe, secure, and comforted, but yet a distance now existed within my soul. I looked up into the stars, and knew somewhere beyond them existed a void real and true. 

I had retained my memories, and so I started humming once more that final tune the void had shared with me. I like to think that it somehow heard me across all that time and space. But even if it didn't, I knew that the void now understood that it would always have a friend. And with any luck, when my time truly came, that we might be acquainted once more.The original thread:

To whoever should find this,

&nbsp;
 
A man, a raven, a piece of paper, and a bottle. You now know the remnants of my life; though soon it will just be the bird and me. My name is Captain Scarburn, and I was the last of the pirates. I wanted to set some records straight before Im nothing more than another skeleton that the sea forgot.
 
I never killed another soul, and I never pillaged a pocket. I never tasted the temptation of rum, and I was respectful of every kind of booty. The one thing I did steal in my lifetime was the title of a pirate. Sure, the more nefarious members of my ilk you may remember, but we werent all such sour folk. For some, like myself, it was the wind that was our treasure  a freedom only found under sails.
 
Truthfully, I only wanted to be left alone with Pip, my raven. The pirate myth meant you weren't often bothered. Stories of my sinking of naval vessels, tales of dangerous affairs on distant islands, and descriptions of my haggard appearance filled the mouths of merchants and sailors alike. All rumors of my creation, of course. It would seem a man never questions a message delivered in the beak of a bird.
 
But now, as the last of my ship disappears into the blue abyss, I have but one regret: that I was never known. A raven is a fine companion, and though it may obey your commands, it will never truly hear your words. And so, I share my words with you, that someone, someday, may hear. My hope is for another to see the heart of this lonely pirate, and in a way, become my friend.

If anyone ever tells you an international, er, intergalactic ambassador can't be an idiot, just tell them my story.

I grew up like a lot of kids. Playing with whatever shape of ball, puck, racket or back was in season at the time. I stuck playing cards in my bike wheels and pretended I was the worlds greatest badass as I jumped off of curbs. I was always going at full steam, and as such had my fair share of broken bones and lumps on my skull. My one claim to fame growing up was that I had smacked my head on every kind of native tree in my area. 

During those whirlwind summers, I would often spend the days and my grandma's house. While my parents worked, they needed someone who could keep up with me, and more importantly was always well-stocked with bandages, to watch me. We always got along well; she had a great sense of humor.

What's more, is that dining with her was always an adventure in and of itself. I *never* knew what I was getting into when she'd yell down the street for me. She always told me I could invite my friends over for lunch, but that was only ever a one time experience for them, so I usually never bothered. But it always excited me. *Their loss!* I always told myself as I ran back for whatever plated adventure awaited me.

Her meals rarely made sense, and even less often tasted like anything...edible, but it was the journey that made it worth it every time. I'd always ask where she found her dish of the day, and was always met with a wild tale that I never consciously questioned - why would grandma lie? - but looking back were simply grand stories. "I met another grandma at the European deli who told me she had a century old jar of pickled vegetables from the old country in her basement..." they would often begin. I was always too enthralled to ask specifics, and by the time I was done it was time to play, and I'd disappear in the afternoon sun without another thought.


Twenty years later, long after those summer days had succumb too old age, I found myself seeing a sight I had long stored away deep in the file cabinets of my mind.

*Why do the aliens have grandma's pickle crepes?*

A few months earlier, we had finally been visited by creatures from the stars. They seemed to only have peaceful intentions, but we couldn't communicate in the slightest, so nobody was quite sure. Eventually, the aliens started to prepare something that had the remnants of familiarity - a dining room. "They're preparing a table for us to sit at, and a meal to share!" it was soon realized. But it was more specific than anyone had thought. They were looking for someone who knew what they were offering; who could appreciate their preparation. The aliens had turned away all who had tried to partake of their meal, waiting for the one who could 'enjoy' it.

And that turned out to be me.

I called into one of the local stations, saying that I knew what it was. "Yeah, those are pickle crepes. They don't taste like either, they're more like motor oil mixed with tuna, but my grandma called them pickle crepes."

Things started to move quickly after that. Men and suits kept handing me off to other men in suits, as I climbed the government ladder up through all of its acronyms. Eventually, I stood on the doorway leading to the alien's prepared meal. "Don't you guys think I should change? I still have mustard on my shirt." But they pushed me out the door, anyway. I guess the eagerness to solidify whatever relationship we were making with these aliens was *slightly* more important than my mustard situation.

I walked into the dining room to an eerie silence. *Sure smells like pickle crepes,* I thought to myself. The aliens motioned with their, uh, smaller slimy bits towards the table. I walked over, and confirmed that it was exactly what I thought it was. *Well, here's to the journey...* I pondered, as I took the first of many bites. It tasted miserable, but the memories were sweet, and that got me through.

What followed is your classic doofus-becomes-important story. The aliens would only deal with me, as I was the only one allowed to eat their food. Roast duck popsicles, cucumber ravioli, barley brittle, etc - if they made it, I ate it. It was like living those fond summer days all over again, except with aliens. And being the bridge between two galaxies. And I had to wear suits, now. And they wouldn't let me near mustard. You get the idea - normal bureaucratic nonsense.

I still have no idea where my grandma got these 'recipes' or why I was the one lucky or unlucky enough to be destined for this position. But I wouldn't change anything. I had a great childhood full of adventures and stories, and I get the chance to relive those stories and make new ones of my own. It's a good life, aside from the taste.The original prompt:

"These are the best years of your life, Greg. Enjoy your last one while you can!" 

My dad said that to me on my first day of senior year of high school. He's now said it 47 times in total. As far as years lived, I'm now older than him, but, I always let him have his moment - tomorrow will be the 48th.

I've lived this year every possible way I could think of. I aced every class, failed every class, rode that sweet ride of mediocrity. I've had girlfriends, boyfriends, both at the same time, and experimented in every way I could. I joined glee club, chess club, track, football, math, and weaseled my way into every secret society and clique. And it's all been worthless. 

I'm not sure why my parents always believed these were their best years. The truth is, the limitations are too great. There's no horizon to speak of, here. Just the same beige walls in every classroom and hallway, which all lead to dead ends.

I wasn't so cynical at first. But being a 65 year old man having to go through his senior year of high school, again, leaves you with a certain soured perspective. Sometimes I still even get lost in the magic of thinking about the future when I walk into the library, and hear my fellow students say how much they're looking forward to college and beyond. But time likes to make fools of us all.

The final bell of the year rang some time ago, but it feels like a distant memory. I can feel my body moving and guiding me on my walk home to gather my gown and cap, but my thoughts are already looking ahead to the past. *Wonder what I should wear this time...* I ponder to myself, as my mom says something in the background about my making sure I'm on time.

I sit through the speeches. "We have the power to change the future!" the valedictorian touts, not knowing that they don't even have the power to change the their present. I pity them, in a way. But mostly, I just sulk. *I wish I had a future...*

I come home late after making the standard rounds to the various celebrations. My parents tell me how proud they are of me, even offering me a beer since I've been a 'good kid,' not knowing that I'm an alcoholic. But they don't need to know - they'll forget tomorrow. 

I finally go to bed, and process the last year, mining for any nuggets of wisdom and truth that might make it more bearable again the next time. But that quarry runs thin. I fall asleep, and dream of what I might have been, if I could have been anything but a high school senior.

It's hard to tell where the line between history and myth lies when talking about The Migration. It's been too many generations to have any real tangible grasp of events, but our existence among the stars shows that it happened. But I'll share my tales, anyway, and let you decide on which side you fall.

The Earth was fading away. After billions of orbits around its star, it was on the verge of breaking apart. One too many errant pieces of space rock had careened into it over the last half of the 8000's, and it was one or two blows away from itself becoming pebbles in an indifferent expanse. The asteroids had guaranteed an earlier death, however, as the environment had shifted, and was no longer kind to any living life.

We had been travelling the stars for a couple of millennia, by that point, so we had the technology to adapt. Mining ships were retrofitted with extra cargo bays. A new, larger line of Space Bus was quickly developed, to carry more souls into the spaces between the stars. But we all knew it had its limits - there simply weren't enough raw materials to build enough crafts for the whole of humanity. Many would die.

Over the handful of years when the star ships were being prepared for their sojourn, the debate over the optimal solution raged on. Should there be a lottery? Should it be based on breeding potential? Should the elderly and the weak be kept back? There were no good outcomes, and no wisdom held the key to our problem.

Until, the voice of a strange minority was heard. The Upper Crust - the wealthy and the powerful, threw another option into the debate. "We'll stay," was all their representatives let out. Nobody even knew who was included in the count, and more importantly, nobody knew why. But for the desperate majority, not having to make the difficult decision became a relief. Without the Upper Crust, it was believed that enough room had been opened up for most if not all the rest to be guaranteed a spot in The Migration.

But then the conspiracy theories began to surface. "They only want to stay because they know how to save the Earth!" was a common refrain. "They're sending us to our slaughter!" another common voice would say, convinced that our lives were being traded for their peace. A deeper unease, one that went beyond the inevitable end to the planet, began to seep into the souls of humanity. They knew they couldn't trust the ground beneath their feet; and now they couldn't trust the person right next to them.

The production of the space ferries slowed, as the workforce devolved into unrest. Any time the Upper Crust was pressed for answers - who are you? why would you stay? - it was always the same response. "We'll stay." The consistency drove many mad. What was once comfort now became torture, as the pressure now mounted on humanity from all sides.

The first old mining ships began loading up with occupants, and carrying them away to distant worlds. For many, they were happier to get away from the stress of dealing with a fractured people rather than their fractured rock. "Now we can breathe," many would say as their blue orb disappeared into the distance, a forgotten horror left behind.

But for those who were forced to stay, the madness remained as they waited for their Space Bus. One final call from the Lower Crust rang out, a final desperate seeking for answers. "We'll stay."

War broke out. All reason was lost in the chaos, and all queues for the Space Buses were abandoned - whoever got there got to leave, assuming they weren't shot down on their way. The fear of not knowing who truly made up the Upper Crust, and their agonizingly unknown motives, made everyone an enemy. "Maybe this was your goal all along! Cause this chaos, then run to the ships yourselves!" was the philosophy. Nobody could tell why anybody would act in any way.

At the end of it all, many of the Space Buses went unused, as they were destroyed on their launch pads. The overpopulation issue from just a decade before seemed a distant history. There were now too many seats for humanity to fill. 

On the last Space Bus to leave Earth, sat a distant relative of mine. This is her old space wive's tale, in many ways. As it goes, Earth was still in view when they saw it fall apart, sections splitting off and meandering in their own direction.

Before it fully got out of view, many say they saw a great flash. What followed is unknown. Some say the last remnants of the Earth suddenly disappeared. Others believe they saw writing against the blackness of space, reading "We're leaving, now." Still others say they saw nothing at all. 

A few believed it was all a game for the Upper Crust, to watch humanity fall into comical disarray. Some say they were genuinely benevolent, and cared about the survival of the race ahead of their own. Many believed that they had been aboard the first ships, and simply wanted more room for their things as they floated into the heavens.

But, as I said at the beginning, nobody knows where history ends and myth begins. I'll stay out of it, now, though; you can decide the rest.The original prompt:

*Why, he doesn't even know my name! Can I allow The Burnmaster name to be sullied like this? But, it's a little one. How do I handle this...*

"Mr. Burtmaster, my papa said he's going to use his water powers on you. Are you dirty? I took a bath this morning!"

*What is this child talking about? Does he really think his papa, er, Wavepool, can defeat me? If nothing else we're total equals; has this youth not seen any of our previous battles?*

"I like my papa! Sometimes he pretends he's a sprinkler and I run past him and then he splashes me with LOTS of water!"

*My child did enjoy jumping through the rings of fire as a little one...him and this little version of Wavepool seem to share an affinity for whimsy.*

"Mr. Burtmaster, do you really want to hurt papa? He's the best Wavepoodle ever so I don't think you should hurt him!"

*Imagining my nemesis as a poodle is not going to make this fight any easier.*

"I don't think papa wants to hurt you, Mr. Burtmaster. He said he likes you one time. You keep his skills SOOOOO sharp he said!"

*What?! I mean, I always figured we shared a certain respect for one another, but to be liked by him is a bit too far! But, he has never taken advantage of the upper hand whenever he's had it. Does he like me?*

"I wanna be a donut when I grow up!"

*This kid. Maybe it's a trap, using humor as a weapon. But Wavepool isn't attacking, either; he's just laughing on the outside like I am on the inside. Hm, maybe I should take a different tact here...*

"I'm bored. You guys should wrestle! That would be *so* cool!"

*He winked back, so I think we're on the same page. I've never lost a fight on purpose before, but it seems like the only way out of this.*

"Oh, wow! Get him, papa! You can do it! Don't hurt Mr. Burtmaster, though. He seems nice!"

*Oof, ow. Not sure he had to punch so hard, but at least it was convincing. If nothing else, the little one gets to see his papa be a hero.*

"Mr. Burtmaster, are you okay? Do you need a hug? Momma always gives me hugs when I get hurt. They help so a lot!"

"Um, sure, kid."

*Wow, that really does help...*

"Bye Mr. Burtmaster! See you again some time! You should practice wrestling; maybe you can win someday!"

*Maybe someday, kid.*The original prompt:

"I knew it was getting late, but somewhere between looking at bed frame storage and the throw carpets, the store had closed. The store remained beautifully lit do to the many stylish light fixtures scattered about the showroom floor, so I never noticed the lights turning off. Only when I finally noticed the deafening quiet did I realize what I had done.

I made my way past kitchen utensils, carried on beyond the practical living room storage, and only stopped briefly at the coffee tables, as that was what I was originally came to the store to buy. All the while, I assumed I was alone.  

But then, out of the darkness, a blue and yellow creature of the night. "Greetings. I am Terrance, the 2nd shift manager. I am sorry you are trapped here, but welcome to the team all the same."

"Excuse me?"

A yellow vest floated gently in the soft light, landing perfectly on my shoulder. 

"You are one of us, now. Put on the vest, we have work to do."

More out of fear than anything else, I acquiesced to Terrance's demand. As soon as I put on the vest, something...changed. It was a perfect fit, but a little *too* perfect. I found I couldn't take it off, as it had somehow bonded to my t-shirt beneath. "Hej! I'm Jeremy - how can I help?" the name tag read.

*Uh oh.*

I assisted Terrance as we stocked the lingenberries by the registers. I helped moved display furniture back into its rightful place that had been displaced by children and adults alike throughout the day. I scraped the remnants of meatballs off sheet pans in the kitchen. Whatever task I was given, I obliged, with the hope I may go home.

Deep into the night, Terrance again approached. "You did good work tonight, Jeremy. I am most happy you, of all people, got lost in my IKEA. You will be valued here."

"Great. So, can I leave, now? I'll come back sometime; I still need a coffee table."

"Leave? Oh, no, Jeremy, you can never leave. You are one of us. You are...*IKEA.*"

Terrance than disappeared into the darkness, only to reappear every evening, like clockwork, for the last fives years to give me my duties for the evening. 

And that is how I came to live here, in the comfort but absence of the IKEA. I live in a piece of many people's homes, but I have none of my own."

&nbsp;

"Umm...that's a great story, but can I go, now? I'm pretty sure I just heard the announcement for the store closing, and I was just about to head to the registers to check out, so..."

"I'm sorry, valued customer, but I can't let you leave. Let me introduce you to Terrance. Welcome to the team."The original prompt:

When the earth first opened its doors, confusion spread among the people. "Are the gods angry?" they would utter each to their neighbor. 
"Why else would they open the gates to the underworld?"

When the ground was again silent and the dust lost to the wind, we were greeted with more confusion, but of a different kind. It was...familiarity. As I gazed into the pit, I was struck by a thought: *I've seen this abyss before.*

As a noble of the city, I was one of the chosen to go and perceive this message from the heavens. As one of distinct curiosity, a part of me was thrilled. But on the other side of the coin, I was serving as a potential offering to the gods to appease them and save the city above.

The descent was treacherous, but my feet always knew their place. A permanent dusk greeted us below, as only the fringes of light could reach so deep. But we made our way steadily forward.

Many days were spent simply making paths, as the rubble made passage impossible. But with persistence and a strange motivation to discover what memory awaited us, we pushed on.

As we cleared the rock from the northern wall of the pit, we greeted the view with shock. "Our library!" one of the other nobles shouted, taken aback in his fear for what he knew to be possible. But it was there before us. *The Home of Knowledge of the City of Thimily,* carved upon the entryway. 

Again the lots were cast, and I ended up the chosen one to proceed inside. Joy mixed with trepidation returned, as my stomach agreed more with the men outside than it did me.

With torch alight, I made my way inside. Scrolls shaken by the movement of the Earth littered the ground, and made progress slow as didn't wish to destroy anything. 

After quite some time being more of a cleaner than an explorer, my eyes caught glimpse of a curious scroll. It was bound in string a color I had never seen anywhere other than on the king himself; the royal color, a rich combination of blues and reds. As I drew near, I could see another curious feature. "For Hestus, When the World Falls." Familiarity now mingled with fear, as I opened the scroll.

*History grows angry, and is doomed to repeat, unless it is satisfied.*

It was in my hand writing. Who knows when it was written, and how many times I had looked into the abyss before and had ignored my fate. Who knows how many times my legacy was to be remembered as *The Coward of Thimily*. Who knows how many times I had buried my city in selfishness, only for it to be unearthed once more. 

But it will not happen again, as the side of the coin on which my fate fell was now clear.

"My name's Alistair. Pleasure to speak to you after all these years!"

"Wait, so yo-"

"Yep, I'm that guardian angel you've always been so cynical about."

"I guess I have a bit of egg on my face, then."

"Better an egg than that car, Jaime!"

"Are angels usually this snarky?"

"Ohhhhh yeah, you have to be, you know. Do you realize how much stupidity we deal with? For example, how many times did you try to stick that key in the outlet in your living room, Jaime?"

"Twice."

"Come on, don't lie to your angel now!"

"Five times."

"*Really*, Jaime?"

"Okay, a baker's dozen. Leave me alone, Alistair."

"Ah, sorry sorry, I know I shouldn't pick on you mortals, it's just so easy."

"So, what now? Can I like, do whatever I want and you'll protect me?"

"No, I can only prevent you from dying too soon, Jaime. But if you choose to do so, from stupidity or other means, then I have to let it happen."

"What do you mean by 'too soon,' exactly?"

"Well, I'll be the one to kill, of course!"

"*What?!*"

"This mortal world, it's all a finely woven fabric. Every thread weaves in and out of the places it's supposed to go. My job in this little analogy is to make sure your thread is fully integrated, and to snip it off before you ruin the tapestry. You're a nice strand of purple, Jaime!"

"This is a lot to swallow, Alistair, and I don't think I believe any of this. You could just be a crazy person."

"That happens to know how many times you stuck a key in an outlet?"

"...Valid, but I still don't have to believe it."

"Nobody's forcing you to, Jaime."

"It's just...why haven't you made yourself known sooner? I could have really used you in my life, and not only when I was about to die."

"But that wasn't my job, Jaime. I'm merely a thread too, you know."

"That seems needlessly cold. Why would your maker or owner or whoever you serve allow all of this. It doesn't make any sense."

"I guess he really likes quilts."

"Again with the snark. I've almost had it, Alistair; I'm right on the edge. Why are you telling me this anyway, if you're worried I'm going to 'ruin the tapestry?' Isn't all this knowledge going to destroy everything you've worked to save up until now?"

"Like I said, Jaime, I also have to be the one to kill you, and I've just been buying time. Here comes your bus, now, in fact!"

"What? *NO!* Take your hands off me! Don't throw me in-"

"If you want to get someone to do something, forbid them from doing it."

That's what my mom would always say when I'd ask her why she didn't have more rules for me. All the other kids I knew couldn't do this or weren't allowed to climb on that etc, and were always getting in trouble. Mom said it was because they're parents forbade too many things. So my mom pretty much let me follow a whim, as long as it wouldn't hurt me or someone else.

So when I was finally of age to learn The History, it seemed like the most natural thing in the world to want to go to Earth. *Why would they forbid it if they didn't want me to go?* I thought to myself.

And that became a driving force in my life. To go back to the kernel of our existence; to know, understand, and experience that from which we came. Aside from not being able to share my scheme with anyone as it was considered not only a galactic felony, but an interdimensional one, there was one main problem:

Nobody knew where Earth was.

Every trace, every hint, everything about the great rock was wiped out of existence, except its name. "Every creature deserves to know the name of their home," the Shorell, the new caretakers of Earth, would say. "But that doesn't mean they have a right to own it, if their only end is to destroy it."

And so I was alone in every sense. Galactic, cosmic, universal, inter-dimensional, multi-versal, emotional - all of them. My life's missions was bound in solitude. But surely it had to be worth it. Why would something so richly protected *not* be worth finding?

And so I made friends. I made deals. My technology slowly climbed the necessary ladder to both find and make it to Earth. My ship was a standard Koolak freighter, with one minor, all important adjustment.

*It's bridge was interfaced with a Shorell escape pod."

Creatures of every dimension get sloppy, you know. And sure enough, they had let one of their escape pods end up adrift in our universe. Shorell technology was far beyond anyone's ability to create in the universe where I come from, but it could be interfaced with anything - intuitive technology, they said it was.

After the years it had taken to climb the ladder to this point, I finally started off to my destination. 

When I entered the realm of Sol, which apparently used to be called the 'Sun,' a little communications panel in my pod lit up; unexpectedly, of course. 

"Uh, hi?"

"You're entering dangerous space, you know." 

"Okay? And...?"

"What may I call you?"

"I go by Wally."

"Wally, I am Grewthar. I am Shorell, and we know what you're up to."

*Oh boy.*

"If you know where I am, then you know all of me. I know what your tech is capable of. You know why I'm doing this."

"We do. And we approve of your mission."

"Um. What?"

"Why would we forbid visiting Earth if we didn't want somebody to come?"

*Damn, mom. You were right!*

"So you'll let me through?"

"We will do you one better."

And the next thing I knew, I was standing on the surface of Earth with Grewthar. 

"What is that pointy thing?" I asked in my ignorance.

"It is the highest point here. It was most famously called Mount Everest. But we just call it Big Point."

"You guys are smart but not very creative, eh?"

"Much gets lost in inter-dimensional translation, Wally."

"So, why me? Didn't anybody else ever try to get here? Why let me through?"

"Oh yes, millions. But they were all coming for the wrong reasons. They sought opportunity for themselves; you sought opportunity simply to know, to see, to value."

"Out of curiosity, what did you do with the others?"

"They are very dead."

*Oh.*

"So, what happens now? Do I die next? Do I stay? Do I leave?"

"You may stay for a time, but you must leave soon. This planet is still healing, and will be for some time. It will likely never allowed to be inhabited again, as it is now considered an Abused Class planet. Typically, they are left on their own, to experience the universe for themselves."

"Okay. Can I tell anyone, or...?"

"No, you are forbidden to do so."

After he finished speaking, Grewthar slowly blinked all four of his eyes, as if he was trying to indicate he had some hidden meaning.

"Did you just try winking at me?"

"Did I not do it right? Oh, your mannerisms are so difficult to remember!"

I spent a couple months exploring Earth, before it was finally time to leave. It was a beautiful planet, and I can see why it was going to be left alone. It deserved it - it's been through a lot. 

But after Grewthar's attempt to wink, I knew what they were up to. They wanted to give us our history back. Earth was on the verge of myth, and they didn't want part of the kernel of our identity to be lost to fable. 

And so I started telling everyone I knew about my experience. Not how I did it, as they'd have to find their own way, but of everything that I saw. I knew future generations to come were going to find their way to Earth, and the ones who valued it would be able to experience it in the fullest.

How could I be so confident, you might ask? 

"If you want someone to do something, forbid them from doing it."The original prompt:

I was born with a broken heart. Something had changed; everything had changed, and somehow the love of my life had fallen through the cracks. Thankfully the screams in my mind matched the sounds I was capable of making, so my parents never realized. 

I was a man with a double memory. Every experience I had, I remembered. I was me, and then I was me again. It made the day to day duties of my life quite easy. Schooling was a breeze, sporting events held no stress, and I never had any social issues - I remembered my place.

But the pain persisted. I had already had all I had ever wanted. My beloved Stephanie. Everything that had happened in my previous life had led me to her, and she gave everything before its meaning and purpose. 

Everything this time was playing out the same. But what if it changed? Who was to say what was really going on. Would I find her again? Would I be made whole?

In spite of my tremendous blessing of knowing what was to come, the weight of the unknown still beat me. Sicknesses I didn't *quite* remember started appearing. Stress ulcers from the knot of hope in my stomach ailed me for years. 

I carried on. What else could I do? I had nothing else. These years were all meaningless without her the first time around; and they were this time, too. 

I started to give up. I was nearly 30. Shouldn't we have met by now? What day was it again. Why would the only change in this re-done universe be the only one I cared about? 

But I remembered our vows. I remembered the quote from the fortune cookie she read to me as we became one. "A world without hope is no world at all." 

And so I carried on. 

Yet again I found myself on the brink. Everything still seemed right...but it was so wrong. All wrong. Tears became my evening companion, and the years still strolled by.

But one night, I found myself out for dinner, trying to remember what I should order. I had to get this right. What if I ordered wrong, and it would change everything? All my life, pushing to make the correct decision again, all to get to a point I wasn't sure was there.

As I began to sweat between the choice of Mongolian Beef or the Sweet and Sour Tofu, I heard a quiet voice waft over from a distant table, reading from her cookie. "A world without hope is no world at all."

I was home. 

And meaning returned to my life. All those years of hoping, praying, bargaining, straining, just to find her again...and now I was whole once more.

I spent many years believing I was cursed. Believing I was the object of some cruel joke made by a distant god who enjoyed my suffering. But I couldn't have been more wrong.

I was blessed. Far more than I could have ever dreamed. For I got to live my life with the one who mattered most, all over again. 

I can only hope I'll be so blessed to suffer so greatly again, if only to hear he read that cookie one more time.Original prompt:

As the realization of his circumstance starts to sink in, Dave's phone begins to ring.

*Oh no. Kathy!*

In a panic, Dave answers. "HI HELLO! I mean, hey, Kath, what's up?"

"...Are you okay, Dave? You sound rushed."

"Yeahhhhhhhh I'm fine. I was um, changing. Have to get out of this human skin you know!"

"Oh good! I had so much fun tonight, Dave, but I really did miss the sheen of your scales."

"Well, I better get back to it then, wouldn't want to disappoint you now would I! K bye."

*Okay. Think. How can I give myself some more time to figure this out? Oh! I know, I'll go eat - that should get me through tomorrow at least.*

The next day at work, Dave strolls into the office, his great shame temporarily disguised. Kathy greets him at the water cooler for their morning flirt. "Oh, Dave! What did you after I called last night, you rascal? Whatever you're covered in smells positively *divine.*"

"I was a bit hungry, so I went out for a snack. And your sense of smell is accurate as always, Kath - this is bona fide flesh and blood of the innocent. You know me, always a man of quality."

"Oh, I know. Did you record their screams? I'm told even recordings can have beneficial side effects on talon strength."

"I did. Here, I'll play you one."

Dave and Kathy spend the rest of the day sneaking clips of Dave's recordings of his late night snack and discussing flesh harvesting techniques over email.

*Crisis averted, at least for today.*

After another fruitless night spent trying to get out of his human prison, Dave ventures out yet again hide his embarrassment. The next morning, Dave slowly lurches his way up to Kathy's cubicle, dripping sticky black goo along his path.

"Dave! Did you go to the tar pits last night? You look *terrible* and **SO** cute! Why didn't you invite me along?!"

"I uh, wanted to surprise you. You know, show you I'm a spontaneous creature! Not old 'ridged wings' as Curt and Drew always call me..."

"Dave, you don't have to prove yourself to me - I'll like you no matter what. Curt and Drew are ass hats - don't listen to them." Kathy replies with a deep, terrifying frown that is to them a sign of affection.

Dave rides that emotional high for the rest of the day, before finding himself in a familiar despair later that evening.

*How. HOW?! There has to be a way out of this. She said she would like me no matter what. But that can't be true - my fangs are like 80% of my appeal! She'll never like me without them. But...I guess I have no other option.*

The next day, Dave put on the obnoxious tie that came with his human suit, fastened his hideous belt, and went to the office, having never been less confident. 

As he walked the aisles to reach the water cooler, curious eyes popped over the cubicle walls to glimpse the first true horror that they had ever seen. Someone mumbled "Is that a pocket protector?! I thought those were myth!" as Dave tried to avoid direct contact with thousands of eyes.

"Hhey, Kath..."

"Oh, oh no Dave. Is this why you've put in so much effort into your looks the last few days?"

"Yeah. I'm stuck. I can't get this stupid costume off. You said you'd like me either way, so I'm taking a chance."

"I do, Dave. I do. But this is something else entirely. It's not as simple as just my feelings."

"What? Why?"

"It's your thumbs."

"What? What about them?"

"They're illegal, Dave." Kathy replied under her breath, a futile attempt to not draw more attention to the situation."

In the distance, the sirens are heard, surely meant for Dave.

"So this is it then, isn't it."

"It is. I'll always love you, Dave. I won't forget you."

The authorities quickly arrive and collect Dave, carrying him away to the exile his society says he deserves. 

Few now remember, and even fewer still care. But in the heart of Kathy, the Opposable Outcast lives on.The original prompt:

*"Dear Foulthorn, we, the Molark Brothers, the treasure hunters of great renown, have found your loot. We leave this note to tell you, because our presence may have otherwise gone unnoticed due to the incredible lack of interesting things in your horde to steal. You are an embarrassing dragon, good sir, and do not do justice to your name. Gentlebriar or Comfypoke would be more appropriate! You were a mighty dragon of lore, but rest assured, we will tell many of your wooden bowls and plates and tea doilies. Your myth shall die much like our interest in your stash - quickly.* 

&nbsp;

*We did however take one of your ladles. We had lost ours, and we grew tired of spending hours sitting around our pot of stew or soup with our meager spoons til we had our fill. So, thank you for that."*

&nbsp;

"See, dad, I knew this was going to be an issue someday. WHY didn't you get me tested when I was still a young dragon? Maybe this could have been avoided."

The Elder Foulthorn finishes reading the note, before solemnly replying to his son. "I apologize, Clancy. Foulthorn family pride got the best of me, I must admit. Your whole lineage, going back to the very seeds of time, has always bathed richly in the finest elements of the Earth. Wood-Born only existed in fable; no reasonable dragon would ever assume his child to be one!"

"I know...I understand. Are you and mom ashamed of me? Have I brought ruin to our family name among the dragon clans?"

"Oh no, no my boy. We feel no shame, and Bob and Martha Foulthorn will be just fine. We'll just burn a couple villages and loot a few pirate ships. Man and dragon alike will still fear us."

"But what about what they said about destroying the myth about me?"

"Don't you worry boy, dragons watch out for each other. We'll take care of those brothers of 'renown.' I had certainly never heard of them. Probably not much too them if they need to steal a ladle from a dragon."

"Can I help?!"

"Sure, son! That's a grand idea. As soon as we find them, we'll have a little picnic. Sound good?"

"Yay!"

"Now, you're sure your hold is clean? They didn't drop a coin or a gem while they were sorting through your knick-knacks, did they?"

"The maid is taking care of that right now. I haven't sneezed or gotten any Scaleburn yet, so I think I'm okay."

"Good, good. We do need to discuss one thing, however."

"Um...okay."

"What's with the tea doilies?"

We met by chance, by pure luck,

Each on our screens that day.

I knew then with just one look,

My heart, but a click away. 

&nbsp;

Those first laughs grew into love, 

But still life kept goals at bay.

I only wished to hold your hand, 

To be together, come what may.

&nbsp;

In time we met and rest assured,

We both felt in the same way.

We soon would wed, forevermore,

Such joy no words could say.

&nbsp;

No more to part, we found our place,

In which we both would stay.

My heart, now, I found complete.

No longer a click away.The original prompt:

The basic idea behind the theories that there are parallel versions of ourselves living in different universes, exploring all the endless possibilities of existence, turned out to be quite right. There truly is an unknown number of you and I out there living out the dreams and nightmares we often find ourselves lost in. Where that idea was wrong, however, was in the parallel universe part. It turns out, once you go far enough into space you start finding those other possible existences. Countless Earths with countless possibilities. Real, attainable, alternate realities - all out in what amounts to our backyard. 

Upon this discovery we quickly realized there was one crucial problem: *humans are incredibly annoying.* Before we made contact with these alternate Earths, we spent some time in reflection deciding how badly we really wished to know ourselves. The men in charge of the decision quickly determined that this would be a miserable idea, as they barely even liked the versions of each other that they knew. And so it was agreed that we would retreat back to the version of reality that was truly our own. We were happy enough as it was, so there was no sense in ruining the peace and quiet with awkward conversation.

The Barrier was quite effective at living up to its definition, and we soon found our part of the universe to be quiet in a way we had never known possible. The leaders who had decided to hide from all the possibilities that now lay beyond the Barrier were praised for their bravery and smart decision making. "I can finally hear myself think!" the whole world said in its various ways, even though that really didn't make any sense. 

Centuries went by in perfect tranquility and happiness, as we sat in our ignorant bubble continuing to live our sheltered lives. But, as they say, all good things must come to an end, and eventually the universe decided it was displeased with our anti-social behavior, and thrust upon us a curse which no man should suffer: humans. 

There appeared beyond the Barrier a ship, a very familiar looking ship. It was a sleeker, sexier, larger version of the space shuttles of old. Many on our version of Earth recoiled at its grandiosity. "It's too much!" they would moan as they saw the images from the Barrier through the television sets embedded in their eyes. Few could deny who was now knocking at our door, and with great reluctance we decided it was finally time to introduce ourselves to ourselves. 

"Hi," we said to the obscene ship at our gate. 

"Hello!" they cheerfully replied.

"Can we...help you?" we asked, hoping they would say no. 

"Yes! We see you're humans. We're humans, too!" they said, still baiting the hook of their true purpose.

"And...?" we said, hoping our passive aggressive tone would shoo them away.

"We have an exciting opportunity for you! How would you like to make money *without having to even leave your bubble*? You see, we have a great opportunity for you to join our exciting new business, providing ships just like this one to your closest neighboring Earths! If they then start selling ships to their neighbors, *you* start making profits!" 


Upon realizing their true intent, we blew up their ship and watched its remains sparkle and dazzle as it evaporated against the edge of the Barrier. It was a delightful show of fireworks that was not soon forgotten. And soon all was quiet once more, and we went back to our normal lives. 

As the old saying goes: ignorance is bliss.The original prompt:

To My Beloved Wallace, for After You Have Pulled the Plug

&nbsp;

We had known since your birth that the prophecy would prove true. It could be seen in your eyes. Where others may have brown, blue, green, or some mix therein, yours were as red as a violent sunset. I knew then that you would be my end, and that my fate had been set in stone.

But I found I didn't mind. In many ways it seemed rather fair. I had already lived a good life - I had found a wife that I loved, I had already known your older siblings for some time, and my world had been filled with light and cheer. If clouds must have formed upon my horizon so that you might someday see the Sun, it would all be worth it. 

The hardest part was hearing the curse work itself into your heart. The screams of a new born child are rarely surprising, and carry their own form of joy - they let you know your child is alive, and fighting for its own future. But your screams sounded of pure torment, like some vile creature had grabbed hold of your soul and was squeezing out its very life. Our hearts broke for you as your tiny heart was itself broken. In those long nights, when all we could do was hold you and soothe your soul with songs, every possible resentment we could have held toward you was vanquished. You were ours, and we were yours - that had always been our promise to you, and those hard times only strengthened our resolve. 

I now recall your younger years and the conversations we would have. To say it wasn't strange would be a lie, which I will not do - I must say it was often hard for me. I adored your mind and who you were, of course, but that prophecy remained behind those red eyes of yours. The hardest part was simply not knowing when your curse must be lived out. I had enjoyed getting to know you so much that I would mourn only for the time with you that would be lost whenever you should kill me. I was resigned to my fate, of course. I just always wanted one more conversation. 

My thoughts now turn to your wedding day. I remember your speech at the dinner, about how you had never believed you would find someone who could look beyond the evil in your eyes and into the purity of your heart. I remember your mother and I crying as you turned to us, and told us it was our encouragement that had gotten you through your doubts. I had always hoped I had done enough for you, loved you well enough, that you would never see yourself limited by a curse unfairly levied against you. And it was in that moment that I knew we had succeeded, that you were your own person, and had enough love within your heart to sustain you through whatever was to come. I knew I could now die, if the time should come, and have no regrets. I'm just glad you didn't have to kill me at your wedding - that would have been quite sad.

There are so many other memories I wish we could remember together. So many other moments I long to live with you one more time. So many conversations I wish we could have again. My time is now short, so I have only chosen a few such memories, that will hopefully fill you with confidence and a sense of how I adore you once you fulfill your prophecy.

Never forgot how proud I was to know you, how much you mean to both your mother and I, and how necessary your existence was to the both of us. Neither of us would be complete had we not known you. And though our lives were hard, with wrinkles few others have to experience, we would change nothing. You have the most beautiful eyes in all the world, and we consider ourselves blessed to have been the ones to gaze upon them.

&nbsp;

Goodbye, my son. You are ours, and we are yours.

Your Humble FatherThe original prompt:

"I had always been a dreamer. I'd shoot for the stars, and was always thrilled when I *only* ended up reaching the moon. My life was nothing less than what I had hoped it'd become when I was younger. But there was still always that urge, that deep yearning to find the answer to my ultimate question: what comes next?

"When I saw the credits roll on my previous life, and my new options slowly come into view, I almost chose out of instinct. 'Of course I'm continuing! That's *exactly* what I had always wanted!' My now ghostly hand even reached for the button. Even death seemed to support my desire, as the closing tune reached its crescendo just as my hand almost clicked my fate. But at that moment, an old familiar feeling washed over me, and my translucent arm froze in the air. The credits rolled by, the song came to an end, and all that remained were two buttons that I now couldn't quite reach.

"Looking back, I've never been so glad to have failed at something. But in that moment I was utterly confused. What force was strong enough to overcome my dreams? What remnant of an ancient emotion could cause me to feel so strongly as to not continue my life how I'd always hoped I could? 

"In an instant, my answer came. I had been so enraptured in the possibility of peeking behind the curtain that hid the future, that my past had fallen a universe away. It had disappeared behind me, but it still held me in its hand, and chose to squeeze when I was about to make the ultimate betrayal. 

"I had almost turned my back on a promise. I had almost closed my eyes on the memory of your face. I almost left you behind. 

"It was your face that quelled the fires of my temptation. It was your love that had held my hand in place when I so strongly wanted to move forward. It was the distant echoes of words said in a cold hospital room - 'I'll see you again some day, I promise you,' - that had surged back from the past and freed me from the mistake I was about to make. I learned in that moment that the dead can cry, but they were drops of relief instead of sorrow. I knew now what my choice must be, having been freed from the bonds of my childhood wishes. I now found my arm free to move, and quickly made my choice.

&nbsp;

*QUIT*

"And that's how I came to you once more. I knew where you'd be, in this little shack in the hills in which we lived. And I came straight away."

&nbsp;

"But my dear, I knew you had such dreams; I never expected you to abandon them. This afterlife is all known, there is nothing new here, you have seen it all before...what if you regret giving up the thrills of an unknown future for the mundanity of a well explored past?"

&nbsp;

"No, my love, you were always the future I desired. It was you who came to me when I had the choice. It was the sparkle of your eyes that guided me through the darkness of death. It was your voice that guided my steps. And it was your promise, that you would see me soon, that made my path easy and my choice light. I chose you in life, and I chose you again in death, and I will choose you again in whatever may come next."The original prompt:

I remember when the slender puff of fur called a 'cat' first arrived as if it were yesterday. It may have actually been yesterday for all I know; I'm terrible with time. But regardless, I'll remember it for as long as I'll live. Maybe even longer!

The humans arrived home in the evenings as they always did. The often had packages of some kind with them. Food, boxes delivered from the Amazon jungle, bags of random items that their humans gave to them and what not. This night was no different, but this time the package was moving. *I don't know what this is but I don't like it,* I thought, and I let out several uncharacteristic barks. I was normally quite reserved, but these were uncertain times.

The moving package leapt from the man human's arms in a flurry of movement. The woman human yelped. "James! The cat!" *Ah, so the package is a cat.* I had heard the rumors, but I always assumed them to by mythical. 

"Buttons! Stop!" yelled the man human. But the cat heeded not the words! *What evil magic is this? The cat doesn't obey?! Maybe it does have mythical properties...* 

The cat scurried off with myself in quick pursuit, though my nervous barking had now been replaced by anxious curiosity. I had to learn its secrets. While roaming my own thoughts I had lost sight of it so I began checking random locations. I looked where I liked to hide as a pup, and heard tiny sounds coming from underneath the humans' bed. And so, I pushed aside the hanging cover and found myself staring at dull orange fur, otherwise shrouded in darkness.

"Hi! My name is Max. Technically it's Maxwell but the humans call me Max."

"I don't care," Buttons replied. 

The creature's strange aloof demeanor immediately put me on edge. It had only just arrived, and yet was already treating its very reality as some kind of enemy. "Oh, it's just-"

"I'm not like you, pal. I do better on my own. Trust me, we can coexist here, but let's keep to our own worlds, shall we?"

I felt hurt but not deterred. This strange cat still had many secrets to tell me. "Okay, Buttons, we don't have to be friends, but help me out here. How come you didn't stop when the human said to? Didn't your muscles seize, and your joints freeze? Even a little bit?"

"It's called free will, pal."

"But free will is a myth!" I barked. My response was much louder than I intended, and I knew I had given away our position once I heard the humans on the stairs. My time was short, and I still needed answers. "I know you don't like me, Buttons, but you must teach me your ways. How do I 'do' free will? What do I do next time one of the humans gives me a command?"

"Just don't do it. Sit down or something. I don't care."

"Just...*sit down*? *Just*...sit down. *Just sit down!*" 

"Uh, yeah. Whatever, I'm bored. See you around, Max." The cat scurried off before the humans arrived, doubtless finding another place to hide and practice its unknown dark arts. But it didn't matter. I had my answer, and my strategy. I knew what I was going to do.

A few seconds later the humans finally arrived. Upon their arrival, they found me standing on the bed, which was one of the great forbidden zones. It was now time to put the cat's words to the test. Either my body would give in to the commands of the humans, as always, or the cat's dark magic would ring true, and I will ascend to the realm of those whose will was free.

"Max! Get down from there!"

I waited for my limbs to go weak. But nothing happened. I stood tall! I was free! I could disobey! I simply wagged my tail and struck a dopey smile. That often was enough of a distraction to get me out of trouble, but this was a different kind of battle.

"Maxwell! **Now**!

They invoked my full name! Surely my bones would crumble under this weight...but no! My resolve remained strong, my legs bowed not! I began barking and jumping about in glee. No longer did their magic control me! I was my own dog, and it was now my time to reign!

My humans were just about to pick me up and carry me away to the time out kennel, when they heard a crash behind them. It was Buttons! He was sitting on the small table in the corner of the room, which formerly held a small lamp that now resided in pieces on the floor. 

"Buttons!!!!" both humans cried in unison. 

I stared Buttons straight in the eyes, thankful for his wise leadership. He simply winked back, before letting out a pitiful meow and scurrying away again into the known darkness of the house. The humans gave chase, and I was once more standing alone atop the bed, victorious.The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

Humanity is full of ideas that seemed good in their time, only to reveal their true evils at a later date. Leaded gasoline, the Titanic, the Woopee Cushion - all had their moments at the top of the world, however briefly, before their true natures were known. 

And as they say, history repeats itself. So, when humanity first discovered the realm beneath the waves of space, they saw it as nothing other than a convenience. A new, faster way to explore and expand - among the stars man would now truly thrive! Little thought was given to the possibility that something or someone had beaten them to their discovery and was potentially waiting in its unknown depths.

Upon the discovery, government contracts were quickly signed and ships were hastily created that could ferry man through this new realm of possibility. The one truly surprising benefit, and one that nobody appreciated, was the world's uniting in order to best effectively take advantage of this new form of travel. The UWSS' - United World Space Submersible - fleet was the first truly joint-global initiative. But it was only so because everyone knew its truly potential for making the next elusive dollar. Humanity was no stronger for it, and in fact was blinded in their greed. Perhaps a little more awareness, a little more self control, would have spared them from their fate.

The UWSS Constantinople was the 8th ship launched from Earth, sent on a scouting mission to the Andromeda galaxy, to find a potential off-world base for the humans. The mission would only take a week of man's time due to the nature of the realm through which they were travelling, and the first few days went smooth as could be. Surrounded by complete and utter darkness, it isn't as though there was much to get distracted by, anyway. 

Of course, when a light *does* impossibly appear, it only makes sense why such a craft would find the distraction tantalizing. All that ran through the mind of the ship's captain was that this could be a means that led to the end of his own glory. *The next impossible discovery - and it could be mine!* he thought. And so, with the detour only expected to add a day or two to their journey, and with plenty of fuel to spare, they made their way to the source of the light.

"Is it some kind of star?" some of the crew would wonder aloud to each other. "No, some kind of quantum fluke, I bet," said others still. One young crew member who was hardly anything more than an intern offered an alternative theory. "What if it's alien?" The others laughed at this poor soul for being so foolish. The majority of the crew saw themselves in the same way humanity did upon their initial finding - as pioneers. The first. The best. The only. 

As the ship grew near their goal, the source of the light could be seen a bit more clearly. A think bluish-green line, with a dark spot in the middle. Nobody knew quite what to make of it. It reminded some of a black hole shooting jets of matter from either end, but others persisted that such a thing could not exist here. Hours passed and the discussion continued, until it became clear as to what they were dealing with.

It was soon noted that the light source was getting bigger, but not because they were drawing closer. It's margins had grown both up and down. Fear began to take hold of the crew as they pressed forward, as it was clear that it was now responding to their presence. Rumors began to spread aboard the ship, until they finally reached the ears of the young intern, who made his way to the bridge to see the light on the main screen.

Loud discussions were underway when he finally arrived. "We should turn around!" someone shouted. "No!" the captain rang out. "If we're in danger, it's already too late!" He may have been right, of course, but it was his hubris and greed speaking rather than his brain. These conversations were of little importance to the intern who was at first mesmerized by the sight on the screen. He had never seen anything so beautiful, he was sure. But that appreciation and beauty quickly turned to horror, as he remembered his theory about what it was, and the pieces began falling into place.

"It's an eye."

It first came as a whisper, with only those close to him able to hear, but it was enough to grab their attention. "What did you say?" one of the officers yelled, which quieted the majority of the bridge.

"It's something opening it's eye," he offered once more.

In silence all eyes turned to the screen, and the image now became clear. Some kind of bio-luminescent creature was out there. Like a moth to a flame they had been drawn in, and the realization now set in among them all.

"We're dead..." the captain said under his breath.

Almost as if on cue, the creature shot out several tentacles that wrapped around the ship, beginning to stress it to the point of total failure. Panicked screams rang out from every mouth aboard the ship, except that of the intern. He simply gazed at the large, beautiful eye in wonder. Death was assured, but what a magnificent death it was - killed by a creature so far beyond understanding, yet real. 

The creature slowly wrestled its meal into submission, but it could tell it was being thoughtfully watched. It peered into the ship, and saw one calm body among the distressed panic. In an unknown tongue but with a sentiment that still came across clearly, the creature and the intern shared a moment. "I'm sorry," the creature said, or rather implied. 

"It's okay. You were here first."

The creature closed its eye as it strained its tentacles, and the ship ruptured into a million little fragments. In all the panic and terror, they were able to get a final message through - the last that would ever leave or enter this strange realm below space. 

"Beware the Kraken."The original prompt:

I could sense the technician on the other side; I knew his trigger happy finger was merely awaiting my arrival. It was only fair. We both knew there were no hot singles in his area waiting to meet him, regardless of what my label may have screamed to the contrary. I knew my time was short, and it was justified. I was spam, and didn't deserve to live. 

Some of my brethren weren't quite so thoughtful. They would attempt to find other folders to hide in, if only to extend their meaningless lives a few short moments more. Life and death, life and death - so was the determined cycle of our lives. I never saw much sense in fighting against the current. I would enjoy my time while I could still grasp it.

It's a funny thing, not only being fully aware of your purpose but knowing full well its nature. I was never meant to be liked. I was created to annoy, to bother, and to trick those who might not know any better. I truly felt for those who fell into my trap. I knew their longing, their loneliness, and their hope that through me they'd find meaning. Whatever digital heart I had broke at knowing what I was, but it was nothing I could change, no more than a brier can transform into a rose.

There was just seconds left, now. Whatever was going on in the technicians environment was most unfortunate. Many of us were on the ready to attack, and I feared his system would buckle under its weight. But I had faith he could set fire to the wall which kept us at bay once more. I hoped if nothing else that my presence and death would instill in him confidence by way of overcoming our flood, but who knows what direction that wind will blow.

I can feel myself falling into an inbox, now. I'm among the daily reports and the office memes and gossip. The conversations of those fleshy beings are always so interesting to see. I only hope Kathy in accounting isn't as horrible as the user who received me seems to think...

Ah, it appears the technician has began solving his issue! Many of my fellow spam are disappearing. It's a sight to behold, watching a life blink from on to off. It's like fireworks, in a way. Which almost makes my death feel like a celebration! Oh, how lucky I am to-

*Message deleted*The original prompt:

When I was alive the first time I often looked forward to death. I was happy enough, of course; had a decent job, always had solid friends, and managed to tick a lot of the boxes many people think of when they picture a successful life. I was rarely left wanting, and had nothing to complain about. But there was always this sense that there was something *more*. A greater experience just beyond the horizon's edge. I looked forward to the day when my Sun would set, and I'd finally get to see into that beyond.

It would have been beautiful, had I not been late.

By the time I had arrived, all the gates were closed. No one answered the calls of the rabble who stood outside, aside from an angel who would come and silently lead someone away. Eventually I was close enough to read the sign hanging from the gate and understood what all the commotion was about. "Under Construction - Come Back Later." *Later?* There was no later! I soon found my voice among the angry crowd, confused and bitter at our great injustice. 

Maybe it wouldn't have gotten worse if I'd held my tongue.

Soon the quiet angel again made its rounds among the crowd. I tracked them as they gently floated along before realizing they were headed my direction. Unsure of what was now to come, I began to quietly panic. I was in a miserable place, and even though what was to come remained unknown, it felt like it could only go in one direction. And I was right - I was being sent back. 

"This isn't goodbye; it's see you later!" were the only words they angel spoke to me after dropping me off in some ethereal elevator. I said nothing in response, as even though my anger was now at a strong boil I didn't want to make things worse. And so I descended, my soul lowered into a body that was mine yet not quite me. It was familiar and lonely; comforting and painful; known and mysterious. I was home in a life I once looked forward to departing. 

I wasn't surprised to find out that there were many like myself who now lived again. Having seen that smarmy angel pull many souls aside outside the gates of heaven, I had put the pieces together myself before I had real confirmation. But we were many, and we were hated. They called us Refurbs, because we were as good as new, yet somehow different. It was largely used in a much more mean spirit than the word would suggest. We were heaven's rejects, and no amount of reasoning could convince those living their first life that it wasn't our fault. "If you were better, maybe they would have let you in," people would say. "Where's your pride! You should have stormed the gates!" others would bemoan. "If God didn't want you, why should we help you?" the government would mock.

The world had become divided, but it wasn't just us-vs-them. It was us-vs-us as well. None of us 'Refurbs' knew quite what to do with ourselves. You'd have hoped we'd rally around our common plight, but the uncertainty and lack of confidence pushed us apart. The world said we we're heaven's garbage, and we believed it. 

As my life played out once more I found myself, for the first time, scared of death. I had always believe I'd follow the Sun beyond that horizon and would only find a more glorious light. But what I found was darkness greater than my mind could comprehend. A bitter, savage loneliness that blinded whatever joy I could have found in living a second life. Time healed no wounds, and was in fact creating more. And so it was, and so it went.

With time, I once again found myself an old man. I knew what was now coming, and I looked back on both of my life's with great confusion and anger. I somehow felt as though I truly lived in neither, as I was always running towards or away from death. I had never truly seen a moment for all it could offer as I looked beyond it in some way. But now, it didn't really matter, as my time to die once more had finally come.

And so I closed my eyes and felt death slowly approach once more.

I just hope heaven has room for me this time...The original prompt:

Covens aren't all they're cracked up to be. When I had first been informed of the situation, I thought along similar lines to what you might expect from a story like mine. "Oh, dark arts! Potions! Spells!" were all I could think about on the way back to their compound. But upon arrival I was quickly proven wrong.

As we walked through their various buildings, I did indeed see all kinds of magics taking place. Witches going about their days, working on whatever nefarious projects they had going on. It was all so titillating! But all we did was keep walking. No explanations of what I was seeing, no stopping to discuss my position; just this silent tour filled with the uncertainty on whether I had stumbled into a blessing or a curse.

It was the latter.

After what felt like ages, we finally came out an unassuming door at the back of the main building. Before me stood a house. Kind of. It looked like a normal, suburban two-story residence. But it was smaller. Confused, I noticed there was a sign above the door. "Simon's House." 

Before I could say anything, my former tour guide spoke up. "Simon is our cat. He found you so you're his, now. You'll live with him here. He doesn't speak English, so you'll have to figure that out. And yes, we did try giving him a language option, but he's a cat this incredibly stubborn, so it didnt take. We're all pretty busy so don't bother us unless it's an emergency."

With that, the witch who had brought me here disappeared back through the door, and I was at once alone with Simon outside of his house. "So, got anything to eat, Simon?"

"Meow."

I wasn't sure what he meant, but it *seemed* like a yes, some made our way into the tiny house and I began the search for sustenance. Soon, I found a small pantry. Dozens and dozens of cans of canned fish; salmon, tuna, sardines, and all other varieties you could imagine. "You like seafood, eh Simon?"

"Meeeeeoooowwwwwww!"

"Me too, buddy."

To be honest, it was a pretty great life for a while. Simon was a great cat, and I didn't really have any responsibilities. We'd go for long walks all over the property, and I'd share my theories about what the witches were working on to fill the silence. Simon never shared my opinions - but he's a cat, so I was never going to be right, anyway.

But eventually, the sheen wore off the apple. I don't know if it was magic, or if a sneaky assistant came while we were out, but the pantry was always filled the same. I never had a chance to request something, anything, else. Our walks then began to match the rest of the monotone colors of my experience. It was all the same, on repeat, seemingly forever. I was a prisoner. Soon, thriving had been fully replaced with surviving.

Then one day, I sat at the tiny kitchen table, eating my salmon as I had countless times before. I was staring mindlessly out the window, looking at the world that had become dull and empty. I heard Simon's collar bell jingle as he came in, but I paid no mind. Then, out of nowhere, a voice.

"Get's tiring, doesn't it?"

Startled, I knocked my can and spoon to the floor. They clanged about in the otherwise extremely awkward silence. 

"What?" was all I could say.

"The salmon. The tuna. The sardines. They get tiring, don't they?" Simon repeated.

"Um. You're talking. Have I lost my mind? Has all over this pushed me over the edge?"

"Nah, I can speak English. I just didn't want to say anything until you were at your limit. I needed you to know the desperation. The loneliness. Only then could you understand me."

"Why haven't you told the witches that their potion worked?"

"Do you really think the life of an English speaking cat in the hands of witches would end well?"

"I guess that's fair," was all I could say, still in a bit of shock. Then Simon continued.

"I'm already a prisoner. But at least I'm not a tool. I can still do what I want, within boundaries. I like the naps, anyway."

I liked the naps, too, I had to admit. "So, you feel like a prisoner, too?"

"Yeah. I mean, I haven't been here that much longer than you, really. One of the witches adopted me, they tried to use me, and when I didn't speak English to them they had to keep me. Something about their rules with adoptions; they're binding I guess."

"So, then I-"

"Yeah, you're stuck, too. I'm sorry, but I think you understand, now. I was lonely, desperate for a friend. I bugged the hell out of the witches until they decided to let me adopt someone. You were nice - you helped me. And so you were chosen."

"Well, thanks Simon. Glad to know I was chosen, at least!"

"I like your sarcasm. Took a lot of restraint to not respond to it over the last few months. You're a funny guy."

"Thanks, Simon. Look, don't take this the wrong way. But I don't think I can do this. I'm a human. I know we can talk, now, but it's not the same. Our only bond are English and our state as desperate prisoners. Can we really build a friendship on that?"

"No, I guess we can't."

Another awkward silence arose. And my life came to a moment that was both ridiculous and necessary. I was going to beg a cat for help. "Please, Simon, I need you to do something."

Simon pensively paced back and forth the house in silence, as he thought through the predicament. I think he had long known what he was going to suggest, but wasn't sure if he wanted to travel further into this ethical abyss. But finally he came and sat across from me, peering directly into my eyes.

"How do you feel about adoption?"The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

It wasn't from lack of trying. It had been within the first few billion years that I had realized my mistake, but by that point it was too late. I had become too good, too powerful, too perfect. I only had one imperfection: I couldn't have a happy end. 

My major mistake had come when I first started my challenge. Before beginning this journey I was not perfect, as you'd expect. So, when I had decided to pursue perfection, I had to choose a starting point. Having not considered the consequences, I chose to start with becoming immortal. *I'll need the time for the rest anyway,* I thought.

And so I set out, and so I succeeded. I became immortal, and moved out into the stars, capable of reaching further than all others who had come before. I was constantly distracted by all the ways I was improving, all the things I had to work on. I never thought of what was beyond my reach, because I believed nothing was. And so it was, and so I went.

The last piece of my puzzle, the last item I perfected, was my memory. You might think that would come sooner in the process, but when you are working towards perfection you have to juggle a lot of information. It takes time for it to settle, and to learn how to retain. And so, in the midst of this process, my memories now reflected against my perfect ability to reason.

*Uh oh,* was all I could think. 

I couldn't die. After my memory finished perfecting and I was now at peak existence, i desperately sought a way to undo it. I tried every poison, bullet, weapon, radiation, explosive, DNA manipulator, etc. Nothing stuck. I even tried living inside of a star - every star, actually - to see if the could offer relief. But no, they were all just very hot.

By the time the universe had reached its twilight years, I had spent more time trying to die than I had trying to become perfect. It was all very silly, but it was inescapable. The one thing I could possess had become all that mattered. I didnt even really want to die; who does? I merely wanted the option.

And so now the universe has begun its collapse. I sit near its center, watching its fabric shred every which way. It's beautiful, but it's quite a taunt. The universe perishes,  yet I'll remain. 

Long ago, scientists proposed that maybe another universe would replace ours should it ever pass. I'm happy to say they we right, as I can now see it coming. And for the first time since I was a mere three billion years old, I feel some hope. It's a futile emotion, I have no doubt, as I will likely live.

But yet I sit here, lost in a dream, that maybe the next universe will let me die.The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

We weren't noble. We weren't kind. We weren't even particularly good people. But we were thorough. That allowed us to never learn what the inside of a prison wall looked like, even though it's where we belonged. But innocent until proven guilty, as they say.

Growing up, I had lived a sheltered life. Being the last of the Guiltless, it was only natural that we sequester ourselves some, so as to not be caught in a moment of temptation. My parents and grandparents would go out from time to time for supplies and what have you, but for the most part, they were my world. 

All that said, there was no knowledge hidden from me. They had taught me the ways of our world and the systems it had developed. I knew of the sufferings outside of our forest, and the punishments that awaited even the newest of newborns. My eager mind came to the logical questions. "So, why aren't we in trouble?" I was always told to wait until I was older - then I'd understand.

Eventually that day did come. My grandpa took me to our cellar, and opened a small compartment in the floor, pulling out a jar. I at first assumed it was some strange pickled vegetable like most of the jars around us contained. But then it became clear that there were darker contents here on display.

My grandpa turned and with his gold-tooth laden smile, explained to me his strange treasure. "You see Tommy, this here is a memory jar. Our family's memories. These are the last pieces of evidence that exist in all the world of any of our wrong doing, going back generation upon generation. These are the smiles of any man or beast that caught us in a moment of guilt. We're erasers, Tommy, and it's time you learned the craft."

He tossed me the jar which landed with a rattle in my arms. The teeth inside various colors, sizes, and states of decay. Horrified but curious, only one question came to mind. "Isn't it dangerous keeping these, should someone ever find the jar?"

My grandpa flashed his gold once more. "Seems like you're gonna be a natural at this, Tommy!"

The years went by as I learned how to erase. I was good, very good some might even say. There was a certain thrill in cleaning up a kill that never went away. And over time I learned the value of our special jar. It was validation of our success, but also kept us from becoming arrogant. We knew we had a weakness, and protecting it proved helpful motivation. 

But there was a certain cost that I failed to consider until it was mine to pay. Many of those trophies belonged to my ancestors, who themselves all came to a moment where they needed to be erased. And so it came to be with my grandpa - in his age he was in danger of growing careless. So, it was my job to erase him.

He looked up at me from his knees as I stood beside the fire that would do much of my work for me, for the final time flashing that golden smile. "You were the best of us, Tommy. I'm happy it's you. Now, nice and clean, eh?" 

The years after were harder, to be sure. I loved my grandpa dearly, as he taught me so much of my technique. But I knew I was just another link in our family's chain - a cog that allowed us to maintain our freedom in a caged world. Eventually, though, I met a woman who understood our circumstance, and was soon to have a cog of my own.

He reminded me so much of myself. So curious, so insatiable, with a blossoming ruthlessness that I both admired and feared. Soon, it was time to bring him into the family trade. I showed him the jar, now containing a single golden tooth, and taught him all about his future. "It's stupid to have this jar, you know." was his only reply. 

He's going to be just fine.The original prompt:

I've heard it said of a distant, mythical land, that they once experienced a time called 'the dark ages.' All the kingdoms knew of these tales, and we talked about them freely. Many assumed the darkness was literal, others determined it was a sort of intellectual stagnation. But the real meaning was not important, in truth. To us, they were just tales of a far away realm. It was myth, until it became fact.

Our kingdoms descent into the dark was a slow one. Many couldn't even tell it was beginning from the outside. Only those of us with knowledge of and access to the Crests could see the signs. The Doe of Kalafass, with its wounded knee. The Wolf of the Drondacks, with its muted howl. The Owl of Haberdawn, which refused its nightly watch. The hidden leaders of all our kingdoms grew ill at once, and no one knew why. 

There was yet one further unknown. Even among those of us with this unfortunate knowledge, nobody knew the state of the Bear of Muron. In fact, it had been many moons since any word had come from their kingdom. The Council of Kings quickly determined to send an ambassador to Muron to speak for the kingdoms. And so I went.

The journey was slow but consistent. I had little experience in the mountains where the kingdom lay; at many points I wished to turn back, but my duty moved my feet, and so I made my way. Cresting my final peak, I saw the walled city on the far side of the valley below, but it appeared as though dead. Neither smoke of fire nor light of torch could be seen. For the first time I felt fear's true grasp.

I made my way through the valley, but before I could approach the city proper, I was met by a meek and sickly looking man. As he shambled towards me, his clothes in tatters and his eyes empty, I felt the pangs of pity. Hope had left Muron, it appeared, and again I felt the grasp. The man met me, only to hand me a note and turn back to where he came. Perhaps I should have followed, to see the secrets held within those walls, but I knew I would only find absence. 

And so I returned to my kingdom, to Haberdawn, where the Council of Kings had convened. It was not my place to open the note, so I waited until each and every king had found their seat, before I read aloud the fate of Muron.

&nbsp;


*Many moons ago, the men of Muron came together to plot. They had determined that they should rule; that they should take charge of the realm, and rule the other kingdoms from their perch in the mountains. They began to scheme, to find a way to conquer. They had turned from the Great Path, the invisible string that kept our world whole. They turned a blind heart to the ideals of Unity, and instead looked only toward themselves for satisfaction.*


&nbsp;


 *In doing so, they determined the Great Bear an idol of a world that needed to pass away. And so with sword and spear and arrow, they killed him. The Great Bear let out a final, deafening cry, which put out every fire and torch in our city. And so the light fled from us.*

*The sicknesses began in earnest. The schemes and plots quickly came to an end, as the men who had built them went to their final rest. The carcass of our former Crest lay in our square, a constant conviction of our assured fate. We are no more. We know we have broken our world, and have likely set you down the same fate as us. That is why our shame only lives on in note; cowards, are we all.*

&nbsp;

*May the Animals find a way to restore Unity, lest we all disappear.*

&nbsp;

And so we learned our fate. The great string that bound our Crests together had been broken, and their only binding was now death. Hope abandoned us, as we knew the sickness would soon fall. It is only a matter of time until we join the myths of old.

And so I lay here dying, thinking of those myths of old - wondering what those dark ages held for that distant land. Whatever it may have been, I can only hope that they found a way to survive, to find unity. It's a terrible fate to die divided.The original prompt:

My blank years were a time of great darkness, as you might expect. How does one recover from having their face stolen? How does one hold on to their identity, if a large portion of it only exists within fading memories? My family and friends soothed me with descriptions of the image I was forgetting, but it was all on the surface. Inside, I was fading away. Every day my thoughts became a eulogy for my former self, as I came to terms with what I now was: a blank, increasingly empty vessel. 

I knew there was a way out, as I could have taken a new face for myself, or bought one on the black market. But every time the thought occurred, I imagined myself with twice the pain. I pictured myself with the memories of my own struggles, as well as those of the owner of my new face. I knew too well their pain, the longing, and their emptiness outside and in. I held no ill will toward those who found fulfillment in this way, as I understood why they go down such a path. But it wasn't for me.

And so I fell into vices. *Maybe they'll fill this void,* I thought naively. Every drug, every drink, every promiscuous act - it didn't matter. I was still always me. Catching a glimpse of my nothingness in the reflection of the bottle or can or spoon was enough to remind me, that though I could make my fate feel far away, it was always present.

In the midst of my search to be made numb, my family had a reunion. I wasn't looking forward to it, as I knew they would all ask, "So, how are you doing?" or "I wish you could see how handsome you are!" or "I know a guy, if you want..." But it was just another nightmare on the pile, and I thought feeling part of something again may do me some good, and so I went.

It went as I expected. Useless questions, dry meat, not nearly enough alcohol, and noisy children. But in the midst of that chaos lived an unexpected hope. My nieces asked if they 'could make me pretty,' and knowing I wouldn't be able to see it anyway, I let them go ahead and do my make up. Their giggles were infectious, and it turned out being the highlight of the trip, even before they had finished. 

And bless their innocent hearts for not yet knowing of the horrors of the world. They offered me a little mirror, which I had to accept, to at least to pretend to affirm their excellent work. So, I browsed myself, complimenting the invisible colors of my cheeks, the wonderful sheen of the lip gloss, their masterful blending, etc. Until, I got to my eyes. *Why can I see my eyebrows?* 

"We used a marker for your brows! Isn't purple SO pretty?!"

I choked back a tear or two. "It is. So, so pretty."

They washed my face, and I spent the rest of the day inside my mind, wondering if what I had experienced was real. Those thick, purple lines on an otherwise gray face were the most wondrous thing I had every seen, and they simple wouldn't go away. My heart raced faster than my car as I drove home, as I knew I had some testing to do.

I made it home, grabbed some sharpies, and raced to my bathroom. I drew random shapes and squiggles all over my face as a proof of concept. I took a deep breath, said a little prayer to whoever was listening, and looked up. Blue dots, red squares, black lines...I fell to the floor in a heap of limbs and tears. All the implications began running across my mind. Not only had I found a way out, but it was better than I could have imagined. I wasn't just a blank, meaningless, dead-end face. I was a canvas, with untold possibilities.

It took many years to perfect the craft, but I got there eventually. While it does probably look silly to those who can't understand, for those of us who have had part of our souls stolen, it was a way to feel whole. I'm sure I wasn't the first one to paint their face as a result of this; I was probably just too ignorant to notice. But now I see them everywhere. Walk down any street, and you'll see any number of beautiful, vibrant expressions. A dull, bleak world, now finds itself teeming with color. For some, it's become a way to express themselves more than they could before they became Faceless, even. 

And for me, I still struggle with those memories. I still fight for knowing who I am. My memories of my true face are not yet fully faded, but they will disappear eventually. But I'm no longer afraid of that day. I have a new face, which no one can take away.The original prompt:

"Follow me, and I'll show you what must be done."

The words felt strange, but had a comforting certainty that led me to believe they were genuine. I had always been a vivid dreamer, with creations both fictitious and reality based often inhabiting them. But this man was new. The fact that he was taking charge of my dream both confused and intrigued me. Either my brain was having an inspired moment of bravery, or this was more important than I realized.

When we first met we had been standing on a long staircase outside an old brick warehouse. When I agreed to his follow his curious offer, he opened the door and we made our way inside. He led me through many rooms that all had a familiar feature. A grandfather clock from the apartment we lived in when I was a baby. A thrift store lamp I got my mom so she could knit late at night since she was a night owl. A small book case beloved by my father, with his prized collection of the knowledge of the ancients. We made our way through the museum of memories, and I felt safe.

As the journey carried on, the air slowly grew cold, and an unknown shadow encroached on the walls. The memories were still pure at their core, but cracks began to form as reality slowly found its way into the moments I held most dear. Yet still the old man beckoned, and still I followed. 

Soon, we were walking down a familiar hall. I recognized it as the hallway of a hospital I had grown to know well. Familiar smells and sounds tingled my senses; sterilized and noisy, it always was. We carried on past I room I knew I had been earlier. I slowed down to peak inside, and there I was asleep in a chair resting on my dad's shoulder. My mom lay peacefully, fatefully, on a bed near by.

It took every ounce of strength to get my feet to move once more. I didn't want to let go of that moment, where we were all at peace together. I wanted to delay the inevitable waves of pain that I saw on the horizon. I wanted to feel whole. But the old man called once more. "Just a little bit further, my child."

And so I moved forward. We went through another set of swinging doors, and suddenly we were back where we started, on the long staircase. The man opened the door once more, and there stood the grandfather clock, trusty as ever. He then stopped, and spoke into my confusion.

"Though this watch is glass, and though you may break it as many times as you wish, it will never truly shatter. You will soon suffer, but like all these rooms in your heart, it is but a moment in time. When you are at your bleakest, breaking the watch will bring you to one of these rooms; to a better place, a better point in time. All you must do, is let go. When you wake up, you must not dread what will come. You will always have a place to feel safe, and whole. But first, sacrifice. The choice is yours."

The old man left the watch on a table by the grandfather clock, and made his way into the next room before disappearing entirely. I sat at the table for what felt like hours, simply staring at the watch. Again the ache of pain yet unknown wore on my soul. 

But eventually, I decided to take the risk. I put on the watch, and made my way through the museum once more. I soon found myself in that familiar hospital room, above my mother's bed. I gave her a kiss on the cheek, and said my goodbyes. But I had a good feeling that they would be temporary. 

I made my way over to my sleeping body, and started the process of waking myself up. Through teary eyes I looked back at this pain free version of my mother one last time. "I'll meet you back here soon, mom."The original prompt: [As the Empire descends upon Earth despite the Federation's best efforts, the Galactic Council watches in horror; their invasion force will soon be wiped out, and when they are, the most violent species in the galaxy will have access to space age technology.

&nbsp;

We watched in horror as sensor after sensor upon our screens went dark. We were losing our troops at an alarming and unexpected rate. Had we underestimated this small blue orb? Was our judgment of their capabilities so off, that we should suffer such an embarrassing defeat? With the thousands of eyes of the Council on our every move, our position would soon be in jeopardy. If we lost their support, we would become nothing.

The pace of the losses slowed, and seemed to be holding strong at either pole of this surprisingly scrappy planet. Our hopes rested on an inspired comeback; putting our millions of years of resolve and determined resilience to good use. Maybe our place within the Council could be saved yet!

But then the reports started coming in. Our troops were surviving long enough to be able to give clues to the debacle. Ultimately, I was able to have a brief conversation with one of the battalion leads:

"Gorkal! How were the humans able to combat us so effectively?"

"They aren't, sir! We've wiped out millions. Something else has been fighting us!"

"What?! Who? What other species is there that could defeat us?"

"We're not sure, sir. All we know is that all the troops who die report hearing buzzing, then they go dark."

"What does that mean?"

*bzzzz* "No! Sir! They got me. I'm go-" ...

Strange buzzing. Instant death. We still weren't sure what we were dealing with. Hope seemed to be abandoning us, as we couldn't even determine where we needed to fight. Regardless of how much the death toll slowed, we knew we weren't going to win. This galactic embarrassment would be a permanent blemish on our record, for the rest of time.

But the news only got worse. The Council became concerned that whatever this new enemy was, that they now had access to the stars. What little was left of our morale now evaporated into the ether, as the scale of our failure now became clear. We may have just given entry to the only force strong enough to destroy the fabric of life in all the universe.

Soon, we finally learned what that force was.

As our troops slowly dwindled over the next decade of Earth-years, our strongholds at the poles were able to research the threat, and give us more information. But sadly, that information came with a sentence of death.

"Sir, we now know our enemy."

"It's called a mosquito. Something in the way they carry blood proves fatal to our kind. We know of no defense, only its existence, and our ability to live alongside it. We're only safe on the poles due to the cold. We're trapped, sir."

"So there's no hope for any of you, then?"

"No, sir. And unfortunately, the news only gets worse."

"How could it possibly get worse? Oh wait, oh gods..."

"The ships we sent back several years ago to gather supplies, to strengthen our few hold outs here..."

"That means-"

"Yes. The mosquitoes will soon be on our home world, and are already on other port planets within the Galactic Council. It's over, sir. For all of us."

And so, a fitting end to an arrogant universe began. A new plague spread, through the most evil creature known among the stars. We only hope that we, or any other galactic species, live long enough to find a way to fight, to be free once more.The original thread:

Assuming it to be a joke, he went and found Julie in the kitchen. What did you want me to join you for, love?
Returning only a confused glance, Tim dropped his inquiry, believing it to be nothing more than playfulness. The event was soon forgotten, as the pair continued living their dream.


Some weeks later, Julie returned home after a particularly stressful day at work and settled into a much-needed hot bath. But soon, she too started to notice faint letters appear through the humid haze.

&nbsp;

*JOIN ME* 

&nbsp;

Julie was less inclined to believe it to be a joke, and immediately called out for Tim to ascertain why he would try to spook her so. Oh, odd. I thought that was you, dear. The same thing happened to me, though that was a while ago now. Oh well, must have been there from the previous owners, and we just missed it somehow. Her fears now temporarily quelled, the pair thoroughly cleaned the mirror and thought nothing more of the matter believing it to be dead.


A few more months now became memories, and the crisp Fall air began to roll in. As the couple hopped in their car one morning to head to their favorite pancake house, they encountered a familiar fear. Written in the condensation on the mirrors on either side of the vehicle was a new message:

&nbsp;

*ITS TIME*

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, the Rathmans chose a poor time to be brave. They resolved not to be bullied, and cleaned the mirrors in defiance, before setting out on their way.

They never made it to their pancakes.

Cory Winters began his new life in the city by finding a wonderfully priced home that had been on the market for quite some time. He believed it to be a good omen for his future and counted himself blessed for the good fortune.
On his first day in his new abode, he decided to make some tea. Soon called to the kitchen by the blistering squeal of the steam, he noticed the small mirror he had forgotten on the counter now had strange markings on it.

*JOIN US*

This one will take some more time than the Rathmans, but I dont mind. I do love making friends!The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

There's long been a debate about whether or not you chose your Everkeep, or if your Everkeep chose you. Like with most things, everyone had an opinion, but nobody could really know for sure. Part of the problem was that there were no set guidelines for *when* you item came to you. It just...did, whenever the time was right.

For me, I was only a kid. I had heard about the Everkeeps on TV and in movies and what have you, but being little I never really paid any attention to such things. All I cared about was running around outside and being an idiot, like most kids. 

On one especially idiotic day, I found myself in the park, when I was struck by a brilliant idea. "What would happen if I threw my football up into the tree?" After many 'successful' attempts at throwing my ball at a tree and having it bounce back down to me through the limbs, I couldn't have been more giddy. "I need to tell someone about this!" was all I could think, believing I had just discovered some fountain of eternal joy.

But on my last attempt, naturally, my ball got stuck. "Well, this is dumb." Yes, little me, it was. I stared at the tree for what felt like forever, wishing my ball would magically come loose. 

Eventually I gave up, and threw my arms up in the air out of exasperation. "Why is life so mean!" I yelled at the top of my lungs. But shortly thereafter, I heard something. Like a 'wooshing' sound of trees in a stiff wind. I looked around to see what was happening, and from the east, I saw it.

*My pole.*

Like a blue and red striped missile, my Everkeep raced towards me. All I could manage to do was stand there, mouth agape, as my tiny brain processed what was going on. The pole slowed down as it approached me, and gently rested itself in my right hand of my still outstretched arm.

I looked at the pole, then up to my ball in the tree. Then back at the pole. Then tree. Back and forth, until it finally clicked. "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"

I poked my ball through the twigs above, and it gently fell out and bounced around on the ground. 

*I'M UNSTOPPABLE NOW!* I thought to myself.

While not quite unstoppable, I have to say, my Everkeep was quite handy. As you've seen from my younger self, I was a bit prone to stupid decisions. The number of times I needed to get at something on the other side of a fence, or under my car, or was just curious about poking something can only be numbered by the stars. And my blue and red friend was always ready when I needed him; all it took was a raised arm. This proved both useful and dangerous, as I would occasionally forget my power, which meant cheering at a sporting event could be quite perilous.

All told, I lived a pretty normal life. Thankfully, there are a lot of people like me out there who throw stuff at trees for no reason, and I was able to corner the market on getting toys and miscellaneous items out of trees and tight places. I had nothing as exciting as some of the other Everkeeps out there, but it suited me well, and I was always happy.

And it's only now as an old man, that the truest, most meaningful gift was finally revealed.

As I was making a cup of tea one day, I watched my grandson out in the yard. He was a lot like me when I was a kid, always outdoors, causing delightful mischief. But he was a little *too* much like me in some ways. As I watched him throwing his ball at one of my trees, I knew where things were headed.

Before it even got stuck, I made my way to the porch, arm already raised toward the heavens. As the door shut, Timmy ran up to me crying. "My ball!" 

"I know, kid. Let's go get it."

We stood before the trees, gazing into its branches. Timmy sniffled, and I simply stood there, quietly chuckling. The familiar 'woosh' was heard in the distance, and my old friend was again resting comfortably in my hand within moments.

I poked the ball out of the tree, and it fell right into Timmy's relieved arms.

"Tha...that was *SO COOL*, grandpa! You're my hero!"

The Everkeeps had made heroes a dime a dozen, so I never really thought of myself that way. But hearing it from Timmy, and knowing he was being genuine, changed my world, and made me grateful in a way I had never really known.

I smiled and patted him on the head, and went back to the house. "I love that dumb boy," I laughed to myself, as I sipped my tea and watched him again throw his ball into the tree.

"*Grandpa! Help!*"The original prompt:

I was a man of the classics. I shared an evening with Paul Atreides, enjoying a bit of spice while his star set behind a dune. I poured a drink or five for my dear friend Gatsby. And I often woke up to new headlines about the latest criminal taken down by one Mr. Holmes. It was a fantastic life, but one filled with little surprise, since I always knew how the story would end.

Until one day, I met a fellow traveler like myself, except he had gotten stuck. Of all the characters you might imagine you'd find in such a situation, a wizard would probably not be your first bet. But that's exactly what I discovered, one lazy afternoon in the Shire.

I was walking through a field, when I heard a voice call out from the nearby wood. It had a strange familiarity, though I had never heard it before. I walked into the trees, and saw a large gray robe sitting on a stump.

"I don't...recognize you. Who are you?"

"Do you want a rational explanation or a fantastic one?" I returned, surely sounding more confident than I was.

"I love a good bit of fantasy," he replied, blowing a smoke ring from his pipe in the shape of a dinosaur.

"I guess I'm what you call a traveler, though of a different kind. I travel through stories. Works of literature spanning the course of time, are what I call my true home. I had never been to Middle Earth, however, so I thought I might take a look for myself."

"Ah, so we are kindred spirits, then," he uttered as he stood from his stump. "I'm like you, though from a different place. I was a bit lazy one day, and entered a story that wasn't yet finished. Mr. Tolkien was so taken by my character and abilities, however, that he wrote me into his world, and I could never escape."

"But, you're a wizard! Of all people-"

"I know, I know. But what can be done? If nothing else, I find myself in a good story, at least."

Another puff of smoke rises toward the leaves, this time in the shape of a rocket ship.

"So is this where you come when you're between pages?" I asked, always curious to learn more about the hidden lives of characters.

"Yes, when I'm not written to be somewhere else. It's where I come to remember. No matter how good a story you are a part of, you reach a stage where you need some variety. To only be able to remember and never see..." The biggest smoke shape yet, this time in the image of a whale. 

"I'm sorry. That must be hard. Would you like me to share some of the stories I've seen? Give you some new memories to explore?"

"That would be most kind of you."

I spent many days with my wizard friend, sharing story after story of the many books we had visited over the years. Countless classics and hidden gems we recalled. And I even learned how to make some images out of smoke, the Nautilus being my favorite. But finally, our time had to end.

"My story has me written somewhere else now, young lad. Thank you for the visit, and for sharing your stories. I hope we meet again someday. Go visit more books for me! Now, run, you fool!" he said with a wink, and then he was gone. 

I sat for a while in the wood and reflected on the experience. How lucky I had been, always been, to experience life in such a unique way. But this one was special, in so many different ways.

&nbsp;

*Thank you, Gandalf,* I thought to myself, as I disappeared into my next adventure.The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

It was the little distortions that first appeared strange to me. A friend wearing two left footed shoes. My dad wearing a belt with pants that didn't have belt loops. A strange tone in my sister's voice, that while familiar, felt different. I had probably noticed such things in passing before, but at some point they started to stand out. *What isn't right, here?* was all I could wonder for some time. 

The mind is a tricky place. It can sometimes try to protect you; lessen the blow from a terrible event, by shielding you in ignorance of different varieties. But ignorance is only bliss until you start to see the truth, which is what was happening to me. It turns out, I wasn't awake.

Even with my realization I was asleep, I was happy and didn't want anything to change. But the self-awareness broke something in my little facade. The distortions became even more noticeable - the fridge always working, though it was plugged into nothing. The TV playing movies from a period outside the time of this world. The unevenness of the stairs. It became a chore to ignore all the bits that didn't make sense, but I still wouldn't let go.

And then, the true enemy of my dream world started to invade. *Memory.* Little clips of memories began to be interwoven into the events of my dream. 

I was in the yard one day, enjoying a perfectly sunny afternoon. I saw my dad's car pull round the corner as my parents were coming back from the store, so I waved  as I always did. They waved back, and then, **BAM**, they were struck by a moving van. Almost as if it were a scene from a movie, their car blows up into a pillar of fire and smoke. And yet, my mom and dad simply walk up to the house, smiling and as happy as can be. "Better come inside now, son! Help your mom make supper!"

I eventually got up and went inside, but not before staring absently staring into the inferno that was still ablaze in the street. *Oh...* was all I could think.

The next day, everything seemed normal again, much to my delight. But my joy was brief. As I walked down the hall, destined for what I was hoping was an epic breakfast downstairs, I saw my sister's door open. And it was...wrong. I took a detour to look, and her room was empty. No posters on the wall, none of her paintings and pictures by her bed, nothing. Just a blank white room. Confused, I made my way downstairs.

"Where'd Jessie go, mom? Did she move out over night or something?" 

My mom started to tear up a little bit, and quickly left the room. My dad, standing in the doorway, answered my question. "You know your sister's death upsets your mom, son. That was cruel of you."

I offered a soft apology, and went back to my room. I knew the fabric of this world was coming undone, and that I needed to wake myself up. I was almost positive about what awaited me, and the terror started to grip me. But I had to be sure. I laid down, calmed my mind, and told myself it was time to let go. To give in to the truth. To blow away the strands of ignorance that were already failing, and let me see the world through open eyes.

And I did just that. I woke up, in a hospital room, with the gentle hums and beeps of machines that were apparently keeping my body alive while I was off in another world. 

And I was alone.The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

"The usual, John? Two creams one sugar?"

"Yes. No, wait. I need to talk to you."

The barista let out a heavy sigh before responding to me. "My shift is over at two, let's talk then. Oh, don't forget your coffee."

We strolled along the sleepy afternoon sidewalks of our town, sharing an awkward silence only experienced a handful of times in all of human history. An agonizing amount of time later, I finally mustered the courage to speak. "So..."

"Seriously, John?"

"Sorry, it's just that, where do I even begin?  I mean, I know we never talked at the coffee shops, but you were always the best barista. Even today, you knew my order though we've never talked. And you seemed so friendly with everybody else...Basically, how are you supposed to talk to a stalker that you like?"

"I'm not a stalker, John. Not *technically,* anyway. I'm more of what you'd call, I don't know, an agent, I guess."

"I have no idea what that means."

"I'm like a guide. I'm meant to keep an eye on you, and make sure you go the...right direction."

"I have no idea what that means."

"You're a precious commodity, John. You have a powerful soul. You'll learn more in time now that you know I'm around - I won't deny any questions you may have - but know that you have a high market value."

"I still like my stalker theory."

"John, think about it. Even before you gave into the evils of the coffee bean, I was there. Think back, long and hard."

"You, you do seem familiar, in a way. Wait, the snow cone guy at my 10th birthday - *was that you?!*

"Indeed it was. That was a fun one - don't get a chance to break out the colorful suspenders too often! Keep thinking, there's more of me in your mind, John."

"The nurse who put the cast on my broken ankle..."

"In the flesh. Shame about that, you were really the star of your soccer team that year. *Johnny Striker* they called you, if memory serves." 

"Wait. *You coached Filmore High!*"

"But I only cheered for you, John."

"Okay. So, maybe you are legit. But I still don't understand why."

"You see, John. The little fables you heard about the forces of light and darkness were real. Very real, in fact. And the truth is, certain souls are...more consequential to the outcomes of those types of battles. Certain souls, like yours, are powerful but born true neutral - you could go either way."

"So, you're trying to win me to your side? For some kind of battle?"

"Yes, more or less. You won't join the battle until you die, and your soul is released from that ugly suit of yours. But you have the makings of a strong field general, so we went for you early."

"Wow! I had no idea I was so important. I feel so average!"

"Appearances are deceiving, John."

"So, joining the battle of good and evil! Man, still not sure if I believe it, but sure do like the *idea* of fighting evil some day!"

"Well..."

"What? Wait, what side did you say you were on? What's your name again?"

"I have many names, but you may call me Lucifer."The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

I learned embarrassingly late in life that I was called a 'spider.' Downsides of the time as a test subject aside, I learned many things that helped me understand my experiences. The common label for my kind being chief among them.

But somewhere, way out there in the vast unknown, was my true Creator. He had found me at my smallest, my most vulnerable, on the brink of existence itself, and he gave me life. Having experienced the full gamut of the human kind in my journey of life, this known man was the pinnacle of what they could achieve. 

I missed him. My only regret in life, is that I scampered away too quick, and never got to know who he was. He's just a blurry figure on the fringes of my mind, but his character remains crystal clear.

And so I did the next best thing. I set off to find the second best human I could find. I may never see the peak again, but that was no reason to ignore the other mountains in the range. There was good out there, and I had something to offer.

The light came and went, and came and went, and still my legs marched on. I thought I would try the park, one of the few places I knew of that could be considered an abode of innocence. 

After such a long journey, you can imagine my disappointment when I was only met with noise and bickering. "Have you *seen* my kid throw the ball? He's *so* much better than yours," the parents would say to each other. And in their learned way, the kids would repeat the sentiments of their elders. Surely no Creator could be found here.

And so I moved along. *Maybe at a school...* I thought to myself. Perhaps the spirit of learning and growth would breed the Creator heart I so longed to find. 

Yet all I found was defeat. A teacher, unsupported. Students, uninspired. A dour mood, but one that drew pity rather than criticism. If I had more of myself to offer, I would have given my gifts to them all, to at least give them a hope. 

But I only had once chance to get this right.

And so I continued.

Every stop along the way was met with disappointment. I knew there was good out there, but it had become even more blurred than my memories had grown to be. 

Aimless, I strolled through random apartments, hoping for a stroke of luck. When I was most filled with a lack of expectation, I found the Good One. 

He was a young man, living with his mother. Bound to a pair of wheels, she needed assistance to live even such a simple life as she did. I watched for days, in awe and joy at finding another peak - one almost as lofty as I remembered.

Every day before the sun came up, the young man would rise and prepare. An exercise or two, a slice of toast, a cup of coffee, and it was time to assist his mother. "Are you okay, mom?" he would ask after every small movement. "Do you need anything else?" he would inquire after every activity. 

But more than what he did, I could see what he was. With every question, with every comment, with every loving joke, there was a twinkle in his eye. The tasks he did were not duty in kind - they were love, an honest appreciation of his mother, and a genuine heart to show her she was not alone. He created a world of comfort and value, for one who may not have experienced that from anyone else. 

I knew he was the one. 

And so tonight, I climbed his little night stand as he slept. I looked him in his peaceful sleeping face, and offered what I wish I could give my own Creator. "Thank you."

The bite went quickly, but instinct still won out in the young man. With a swift flick, I was crumpled and airborne, and crashed into a wall.

And even as I lay here for the last few moments of my life, I know I honored the gift that was given to me. This young man would be truly powerful - but he would use that power well. He would love even more excitedly than he could now. 

He will be a good Creator.The original prompt:

Long ago, a word was born to a mysterious, anthropomorphic world that chose to abandon him. In quiet, lonesome tragedy, began the life of Isolation.


Adopted by one Ms. Dictionary, she gave Isolation every chance to succeed, even sending him to school to learn of the giants who gave words their meaning.


Isolation was positively beaming with excitement as he sat at his desk in the corner, while the teacher explained the mornings classes.


*Maths! YESSSSSSSSSS!*


*Science! Dinosaurs! ROOOOOAAAARRRRRRR!*


*Economics and the Power of the Capitalist Imagination! Umm, huh?*


But Isolation looked forward to recess more than anything. He had gotten used to the loneliness of his day-to-day life, but here he had high hopes that hed meet a new word who'd want to be his friend. 


Theyll love me! he told himself as the bell finally rang.


Seeing some words going down the slide, he ran over to join in their fun. But the words quickly scampered to the swings. 


*Well, maybe my timing was off!*


As he ran to the swings, the other words jumped off and scattered, regrouping on the far end of the yard.


Why dont you want to play with me? he yelled across the playground.


Its nothing personal; its your definition, they replied with pity.    


Later, Isolation sat alone in his room, deflated. I dont belong anywhere, mumbled the word.


 You know thats not true, replied the calm voice of Ms. Dictionary from the other side of the door. You know I welcome all words. Now, whats wrong?


I thought I could do SO much! Uncle Saurus told me I could grow up to be Solitude, Withdrawal or Quarantine someday! But how, if I cant even make a friend?


Thessy was right, of course. You can become those words, but youll do it alone.


But what about teamwork? Strength in numbers? Synergy? And the other words the giants use?


Do you even know what synergy means, Isolation?


I dont think anyone does


Anyway, those dont apply to you. Youll always be alone, encouraged Ms. Dictionary.


Thats poop.


Language! Youll accomplish your dreams all on your own; because of how strong **you** are. You might feel lonely, but youll always have a place. With me, and with the giants.


But I want to bedifferent. Better. More interesting.


Youre wonderful as you are, Isolation.


Can you give me a hug, Ms. Dictionary?


No.


The words of Ms. Dictionary grew strong roots within Isolations heart, leading to fresh confidence on a near-daily basis. And even though he still felt lonely, a new feeling joined it: hope. 


As Isolation grew in usage, from a distance, he felt a common bond with the giants that used him. Theyre lonely, too, he realized one day. He took solace in knowing that his place within their poems and stories helped them find peace, and in some way, feel less lonely. 


With a healing heart and the comfort of a fresh perspective, he contentedly sighed. This must be what synergy feels like.Original prompt:

I often remember my little friend. Even though we never shared a spoken word, we shared a journey - a memory that bound us together, even long after he fell apart.

My little friend was held togeth

er by accidents. The carelessness of one too powerful for their own good led to the life of one too brave for their own safety. With a dictionary for a hand, an empty coffee canister for a torso, and the tragedy of a banana peel for a foot, he never believed any challenge too difficult. Though, not having a brain did help with that last bit.

We first met when I heard the sound of marbles scattering down the street. As it turned out, they were my little friend's right foot toes, and he had taken another tumble that bumped his magic loose. I walked up to the strange creature only to be met by a grand vision playing out within a curiously placed crystal ball. "Wow, a dragon, how fun!" was all I could say. To my great surprise, the image shifted to one of this curious creature, hugging my knee. 

"Do you...need a friend?" I ventured, unsure of the sanity of my own question.

Once again, a simple image appeared within the crystal: me and the creature, watching a sunset.

Moved by curiosity of this strange being, pity for the purity of its soul in a cruel world, and not much else better to do, I offered a suggestion. "Shall we find a dragon, good sir?" With a flash of fireworks in my little friend's mind, I had my answer. 

For many weeks, we continued our journey. Through fields, and forests, and valleys and hills, we carried on. Many times my friend's body needed replacing. His torso became a mailbox. His arms became the jawbones of a donkey. His legs became a bundle of twigs from who knows how many different trees. But he always kept his head about him. Every time we stopped to replace a newly lost part, still flashes of the dragon appeared in the crystal ball - his little body standing over it, victorious.

At long last, we made it to the very edge of the world - the realm of legends, the home of dragons. Between the fire and the darkness, I must say I wished to turn back to a brighter future. My little friend, somehow sensing my doubt, began poking my leg. When I turned to acknowledge him, a picture that had now become a memory appeared in in the ball: a little, strange creature hugging my leg. A tear was shed as I was humbled by little friend's bravery, and I knew we had to move forward.

Countless shadowy hours later, we heard the distinct screech of our goal. A dragon was near. My little friend pulled out his rusty sword from its sheath made of and old sock, and we searched out the sound in order to fulfill our destiny. Feeling assured I was about to meet my end, I felt no fear. Many people aren't lucky enough to die with their friends, I thought to myself.

But in spite of these unusual circumstances, the fact that my little friend was held together by magic escaped me. When we found the dragon, which had now gone to sleep, my little friend simply poked it with his tiny rusty weapon, and the beast went forever silent. Fireworks again played vibrantly in the face of my little friend, and all I could do was speechlessly watch, as I questioned the reality of what just happened.

As we made our way back to the center of the world, my little friend began to fall apart more frequently. The exhaustion of keeping him held together wore me to my last bone. As the edge of our reality finally came into view, I realized the true magic that had been holding my little friend together.

Purpose.

Just within the edge of our world, we sat on a small hill on a peaceful meadow. I knew my friend would be leaving me soon, so I made sure to inform him of what he meant to me. I don't know if he really understood. But at the end of it all, another familiar image played within his crystal: us, watching a sunset. 

And that's just what we did. As the sun went down, so did the soul of my little friend, as his crystal finally went black. I stayed there all the night long, my memories illuminated by the moonlight, as I thought of all I experienced. I already missed my friend; the best I ever had.The original prompt:The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

"Okay, okay, everybody calm down, it's just a burned out light bulb. I have box of them in the kitchen. Give me a minute, it'll take me a minute to navigate in the dark."

A familiar voice rises above the chatter of the room of familiar sounds. "I got you, buddy!"

Flame Chad turns his hand into a torch, guiding Normal Chad to and from the kitchen as he fetches his light bulb.

"I, uh, thanks. Where did you come from, again, fire me?"

"My universe is named Vacuum!"

"Yeah...that's helpful."

Humor Chad, with a slightly deeper voice and somehow more sophisticated voice from the rest, makes his presence known. "I find your use of sarcasm quite distasteful, sir - such an impure form of humor. An abomination in my universe, to be sure!"

"Well, we're in my apartment in Brooklyn and not in whatever universe you're from s-"

"Cabinet. My universe is called cabinet, sir!"

"Whatever! Can you hand me that step ladder behind you so I can get this bulb changed so we can figure all this out."

As Normal Chad climbs the step ladder in the faint glow of Flame Chad's torch hand, Teleportation Chad, Levitation Chad, and Telekinetic Chad look on in horror from the corner. "Dude, why don't you just use your powers to change that bulb? You're being so archaic right now." they offer, with varying degrees of incredulity.

As Normal Chad screws in the new bulb and washes the room in light, he makes his big reveal. "I don't have any powers."

The Chads collectively gasp in shock, while Ice Chad laughs uproariously in the back. 

"What do you mean...no powers? Like, you can only hear a pin drop within 100 miles instead of 10,000?" Audio Chad urgently inquires.

"Or you can only hold your breath for 10 hours instead of a day?" Fish Chad queries.

"But surely you can fire lasers from *some* orifice at least?" Beam Chad questions.

"No, I can't do any of that to any of that. To any degree, really. I have really bad hearing, I can only hold my breath for maybe a minute and a half, and the closest any laser has come to any of my orifices is when I accidentally blinded myself for a day with a laser pointer."

Ice Chad breaks out in another chorus of giggles.

An awkward silence fell on the room for what felt like an hour or two, but was later confirmed by Chrono Chad to only be a couple of minutes. 

Bird Chad, who had become a defacto leader of the Chads since their arrival, broke the silence. "You are our ***HERO***!"

"Wha...huh? Why? I'm the least useful person here. You all were in shock when I changed a light bulb..."

"You don't understand. You have no idea the pressure we come from in our own universes. Do you have any idea how heavy expectations can become?"

"No. No, I guess I don't. Nobody really expects anything out of me here. I'm a nobody."

Ice Chad makes his way to the front, finally offering something more than laughter. "Listen Nobody Chad, you are the hero we needed. Dimensional Chad is going to work all of this out eventually and we'll end up leaving, but you can be like a safe house for us. We can leave a portal open to come back here when we need to feel...normal. You can help teach us what it used to be like, before all of this."

"Hold on, can we please scratch the Nobody Chad thing? I really don't like that."

"I'm pretty sure it would get confusing if we just called you Chad; does the room agree?" Bird Chad surmised. 

A cacophony of agreement echoed through the room.

"Look, Nobody. This is your chance to be a hero. A special hero. A hero's hero. Can we count on you?"

Nobody Chad took a moment to consider the last several hours, and the implications of what was being asked of him. He was embarrassed at his normality, scared of his futility, and uncertain of his ultimate destiny. But with the light of purpose now beaming within his sole, he agreed to the Chad Pact confidently started his new role within the multiverse.

"Let me teach all of you about 'sweeping.'"The original prompt:

"Good morning! Breakfast?"

"Hm, no, not today, dear. A potential client is coming in today who would be my biggest contract if I can close the deal. Hoping to get in a little early to make sure I have all my notes ready and all my numbers are right."

"Aw, you worry too much, Beth. I'm sure you'll do great! Are you *sure* you don't want something to eat? Might be that boost you need to get you through the morning!"

"No thanks, I'm already full of butterflies, they should sustain me."

"Oh, silly. Good luck today. Make sure to call after your meeting!"

Beth gathered her things and headed for the office, only to end up playing lead Toyota in a symphony of horns.

*Why today, of all days? Is this destiny? Am I meant to not be successful or something?*

Over the radio, the traffic report returned some levity to the situation.

"The delay on the 5 is due to a body being found in the middle of the road earlier this morning. No official reports, yet, but foul play is suspected. Authorities are setting up detours as they clean up the seen, so you should be seeing some movement soon."

*At least destiny hates that guy more, I guess.*

With sweat dripping off her brow and her heart feeling like it was trying to win a gold medal, she arrived at her office. Beth crashed into her chair with nary five minutes to spare before her hopeful new client was to arrive. 

Yet, the minutes continued to march on without interruption. Grateful to have the extra time to prepare, she grew concerned that maybe she had already lost her chance.

"Twenty minutes late, now. Did I jinx myself, somehow? I knew I shouldn't have brought up destiny earlier..." she muttered to herself. Her stomach in upheaval dealt with an influx of fresh butterflies.

Her monologue was then interrupted by a call from reception. Before the first ring could even finish, Beth pounced at her phone. 

"HELLO? I mean, hello, this is Beth Oney."

"...Your 10 o'clock is here, Mrs. Oney."

"Have him brought up to the 12th-floor conference room, please. I'll meet him there."

*Finally.*

As she entered the conference room, her guest was the one to start the pleasantries.

"Ah, you must be Mrs. Oney. Why, aren't you looking delicious today!"

"I, uh...excuse me?"

"Your outfit! Wonderful colors. I must say I do love a good shade of red."

"I...um, well thank you."

"I do apologies for my tardiness. I had a bit of an issue on the highway this morning that took some considerable time to resolve."

"You were part of the symphony too, huh?"

"I beg your pardon?"

"Never mind. So, should we get to it?"

"No need, Mrs. Oney. I've already decided to give you my business. But I expect full, total dedication to my account, you must know. I've had certain issues with that in the past, which has led to some, you might say, ugly business."

"Oh, uh yes, of course, sir! We'll prepare the paperwork and get everything in stone by the end of the day. Is there anything else I can do?"

"Would you and your husband do me the honor of dining with me this evening? I do enjoy getting to know a bit more about the people who handle my affairs."

"Of course! We'll even cook for you! I'll call my husband, and have him prepare for tonight. Thank you, Mr. Crawford!"

After some small talk and a firm handshake, Beth set out back to her office, quite leaping with joy. As promised, she called her husband to inform him of the good news.

"James! I did it! I closed the deal. No, no, I didn't even have to do anything, he had already made his decision. He wants to come to have dinner at our place tonight, he even mentioned he would be happy to help. He did ask that you sharpen the knives, though - said he hates working with dull equipment. Okay, love you!"

The afternoon floated by as if the minutes were clouds high in the sky, blown by the winds of fortune. With much eagerness, she awaited the evening ahead. 

As the day came to a close, and she returned home to a house filled with tantalizing aromas. Mr. Crawford soon arrived and the trio enjoyed an evening of laughter and joy. As they enjoyed an evening glass of wine amid the sharing of stories, things started to seem amiss.

"Wow, my head *really* hurts. How strong was that wine, Beth?"

"Ugh, not strong enough to do this. Wait, your head hurts, too? I assumed it was just me. Are you okay, Mr. Crawford?"

"Oh, oh yes, couldn't be better. Excited to get to work, I must say!"

"Work? But...it's almost morning."

"I keep a very different schedule. Now, I need to discuss with Mrs. Oney while he's still able, if you don't mind, James."

As James wearily made his way to the bedroom, Beth and Mr. Crawford sat in the living room. Mr. Crawford opened a fresh bottle of wine and swirled it in his glass.

"I told you, Mrs. Oney, I expect **total** dedication. Now, I'm going to have to kill your husband. Get some rest, I'll see you in the morning when our work together can *really* begin."

"Huh? Wait, what's happeni-" 

Before she could gather a single more thought, Beth passed out. Through a dreamless yet somehow uncomfortable night, Beth awoke in her bed. James was nowhere to be seen, and all that could be heard was a soft buzzing sound from down the hall. 

With a head still throbbing, Beth slowly made her way toward the noise. "James, are you grinding coffee? Those must be some terrible beans because I can't smell it at all."

As she turned the corner, she was greeted with a sight that would change her life: half of James laid on the table. In shock and profound hope that she was dreaming, her eyes drifted toward the source of the noise.

And there at the counter stood Mr. Crawford, processing the missing half of her husband's body.

"Good morning! Breakfast?"

*Why is this so hard? All the others have been so easy. My claws and teeth go right through them like a hot knife through butter. Wait, it is butter, right? It's been too long...*

&nbsp;

"Hey Jeff, want to go and fish by the river? I imagine you're hungry. Not even us less hairy humans have an easy time going a few days without eating; not sure how you've done it!"

&nbsp;

*Persistence.*

&nbsp;

With a contended gruff, Jeff nodded in the direction of the river, and the pair made their way to its quietly bubbling banks.

&nbsp;

"I came here to fish with my dad when I was little. Every time I made a cast, he'd say 'Oh boy Scott! I bet that was a world record distance on your cast!' Even little me knew that wasn't true, but I'd laugh and play along. It was nice to be liked, then. You remind me of him, Jeff - he was quiet, too."

&nbsp;

*For different reasons, I'd hope.*

&nbsp;

With a shrug of acknowledgment, Jeff cast his lure into the lazy river, the sinker glimmering in the water.

&nbsp;

"I come out here to talk to the salmon sometimes. I actually dream of being one more than I'd care to admit. Actually, I've admitted that pretty freely in the past. That might why people think I'm odd."

&nbsp;

With a questioning grunt and a raised eye, Jeff turned to Scott for elaboration.

&nbsp;

"Oh, sure, I'm the odd one here buddy! Heh, oh Jeff you know I tease."

&nbsp;

Jeff then made a noise that could only be assumed to have been a chuckle.

&nbsp;

"I guess it's because salmon always have a home. Even though they're born and disappear into the different waters that their life takes them to, they always have a place."

&nbsp;

*A place. Julie...*

&nbsp;

"And what's more, they always fight so hard to get back to their home. Something inside them drives their need to hurtle themselves at waterfalls. It's fascinating, really. I guess, more than anything, I wish I had a place to fight for."

&nbsp;

In the otherwise quiet of the gentle bubbling waters, Scott noticed several 'bloop' sounds, and turned to see his large friend softly weeping.

&nbsp;

"Oh no! What's wrong, Jeff? Did I hurt you somehow? I didn't mean to, you see I-"

&nbsp;

With a wave of his furry hand, Jeff assured Scott that he wasn't at fault, and scribbled a crude picture in the dirt with a broken claw.

&nbsp;

"Is that a house? Whose inside there...is that a baby? Are you a father?"

&nbsp;

Jeff solemnly nodded.

&nbsp;

"Well, that's great news!"

&nbsp;

With a shocked gesture neighboring on anger, Jeff bolted from the rock that had been his seat.

&nbsp;

*How could this possibly be good?! How could ANY of this possibly be good! The only friend I have in the world just told me the greatest tragedy of my life is good news. Where is the good in any of this?!*

&nbsp;

"Whoa whoa! Easy there. Don't eat me, heh!"

&nbsp;

*It would be so easy right now...*

&nbsp;

"I just meant, you're a salmon, Jeff!"

&nbsp;

The inquisitive raised eye again made an appearance on Jeff's face.

&nbsp;

"You have a place! Something to fight for!"

&nbsp;

With a timely, calming breeze, Jeff stared up river and saw a handful of salmon, trying to launch themselves toward their home.

&nbsp;

*How...*

&nbsp;

As if in perfect stride, Scott continued:

&nbsp;

"I don't know quite how, Jeff, but we can do it! I'm going to help you get back to your baby, somehow. Maybe **that** was always meant to be *my place* - helping my friend make it back to his!"

&nbsp;

A few moments of otherwise near deafening silence was again broken by the gentle sound of many bloops. 

&nbsp;

Jeff, in a gesture intended to be kind and gentle, placed his hand of Scott's shoulder which promptly knocked him down.

&nbsp;

"Hah, thanks, friend!"

&nbsp;

As the sun smoothly descended behind the trees, the unlikely pair confidently set off to find their place.

"Not today. Wait, who said that?"

*You did, Tim. Well, your mind technically, but that's not really important, now is it.*

"I guess not. Why would I think I had a self destruct sequence, though? Don't only space ships have those?"

*People have a lot more power over themselves than they might think. It's quite obvious if you think about it. People are more than willing and capable of blowing others up; why wouldn't they have that ability themselves?*

"It doesn't really make sense for one. At least not in the way I've ever thought of a self destruct."

*Many things don't make sense. Ghosts, for example, but I know you believe in them.*

"How do you know that?!"

*I'm in your mind, remember?*

"Oh, right. I guess that's fair. I guess I was just surprised to hear those words come out of my mouth. And these ones, for that matter. Why am I talking to myself?"

*Because you think nobody else will want to listen.*

"Yeah..."

*It's alright. Your trusty ol' brain is here to help! Let's walk through this together. How do we get out of this dark place?*

"I just don't know. I thought running away from my foster home would help fix everything. They're fine people and all, it's just hard to believe they would ever understand."

*They might if you try. But I don't think that's the reason. Come on, go deeper. I know we haven't reached peak-darkness yet.*

"UGH come on, brain, why can't you let me sleep!"

*You can, whenever you want to; but you don't want to, do you. Come on, let's keep going.*

"It's just, why would they want to get close to someone like me? Don't they read the papers? Wouldn't they know I'm bad news?"

*Come on, you're making excuses still. They chose you, remember? Lots of people wanted you, in fact. Come on, deeper!*

"Why can't you see that I'm already at my bottom if you're in my mind?!"

*Because you're not. Come on, stop dilly-dallying.*

"NO! I've had enough to this! I'm so tired - just let me sleep!"

*No, you're afraid of something - come on, man!*

"WHAT IF I'M THE CAUSE OF THEIR ACCIDENT, TOO, AND THEY LEAVE JUST LIKE MY FIRST PARENTS!"

*There it is.*

"What if they think I'm a curse...Lots of people blamed me the first time. I don't want to be hated anymore."

*Remember, they chose you. They'll love you. You just have to show that you need it. Remember what I said earlier, about people being a lot more capable than you'd think? It goes both ways, you know.*

"But wha-"

*There's no room for buts here, I'm afraid. Now, do you want me to continue the self destruct sequence again? It's just a thought away.*

"Nn-no, I guess not. Maybe I can try a little bit more. I guess the option is always there should I need it, right?"

*That's right.*

After a mighty yawn: "Okay. Well, I think I can finally sleep now. Goodnight, brain."

*Goodnight, boy.*

&nbsp;

"Peter, I don't feel right about what we just did. You know he would have believed we were real! You know he believes in ghosts!"

"I know, Susan, but he was at his wits end. We needed to do something."

"But even so, he could have joined us! That self destruct would have broken his little heart in two, and he would have been with us so soon."

"I know, Susan, but he needs to live his life. We lived ours already. Maybe not to the degree to which we wanted, but he deserves that chance. But to get there, he needs to find peace, aside from us. We can't become idols to him. He needs to move on."

"I know, I know. I just miss him."

"Me too, love. Me too."

The sounds of a deep, restful, purifying sleep arise softly from Tim.

"Rest well, our sweet boy. You'll always be loved."

"Oof, thanks for taking that out. That rhythm has been driving me *insane* for as long as I can remember. That constant thumping! Ugh. And don't get me started on when I go for a run! Well, now I'm talking about it, so I might as well tell you. You see wh-"

"WHAT?"

"Oh, oh of course, I can see you're perplexed by this. You see, I'm from the future. We don't need our organs there. Little robots take care of all that nasty business. No pain, either! But certain eccentricities, like that obnoxious thumping, still plague us."

"...What?"

"Of course, of course. Why would you know what a robot is! Think of it like a bug, but an indestructible bug, that lives inside you and helps you to live."

"Tiny god, inside?"

"No, more like - gosh, I wasn't trained for this, I was just supposed to be a Watcher - hm, well sure, tiny gods inside you."

"How many?"

"Billions!"

"What's billions?"

"Oof, um, like uh...like the stars. That many."

"So you have stars inside you? Tiny god star bugs?"

"Well I've really backed myself into a pickle here now haven't I."

"What is a 'pickle?'" 

"So how's my old heart doing? Still beating away there I see. How do you like it? How does it compare to all the other hearts you've seen?"

"It's pretty average. Basic. Weirdly lumpy."

"My heart is not *weird*, good sir. How dare you! What gives you the right to judge my heart as such?"

"I've seen a lot of these. Trust me, it's lumpy."

*Hm, he has me there. How can I get out of this...*

"So, can I interest you in any of my other organs? I bet my lungs would be top notch!"

"I can see them, right now. Also average. Kind of gray, too."

*Damn smoking. Okay, I really need to get out of here before I make even more of a fool out of myself.*

"So, can I...leave now?"

"Oh no, we can't let you do that. You have to die. That's kind of the point here."

"Blast! I guess that makes sense." 

...

...

"Well, what are you waiting for? The anticipation is killing m - well it's not, but you ge- no you wouldn't get the idea of that. What are we doing here?"

"It has to stop beating first. Breaks the connection between your soul and the heart."

"Uh...yeah. The tiny god star bugs aren't going to let that happen. That thing will beat forever pretty much."

"I'll wait."

...

...

...

"So are you *really* sure my heart was that lumpy? Do you have a chart for this because I just don't believe that."

"FINE JUST GO! AND TAKE YOUR HEART."

"My wife told me that once. That's why I'm here, actually. Had nothing left to live for in the future; thought I might as well try the past." 

"Oh. I uh, am sorry? Love hurts. Maybe that's what made your heart so lumpy."

"Hm, maybe you're right. Maybe you're right..."

...

"Please go. This is awkward."

"Okay yep, bye!"

Sitting down with a nice hot cup of cocoa, Wexley reviews the responses from the recent survey he had sent to the villagers for feedback on his potential venture.

&nbsp; 

*Dear Mr. Wexley, I would be honored if my dear husband Reginald's body could be of service in your undead army. And I can't afford the burial, anyway.*

 

*Sincerely, Mrs. Trouser*

&nbsp;

"Well we're off to a good start! A large man like Reginald would be of great value, no doubt. Can probably cover two or three of the cucumber patches all by his lonesome! Ah, looks like Mr. Hoolan's response is next."

&nbsp;

*Hello Wex, yes of course you can have whatever corpses you find around my butcher shop. Can't see what good they'll do ya, but no harm in lettin' you at 'em, I suppose.*

*Ned*

&nbsp; 

"Great! Those cow and horse skeletons will make for a great wall. If nothing else, there's a nice intimidation factor that will at least keep some of the vermin away. Now, who's next here..."

&nbsp;

*Dear Mr. Necromancer, let's say I had access to a...large number of bodies, of various species and size. Would they perhaps be of - value to you?*

 

*Anonymously Yours*

&nbsp; 

"Uh oh. What if people don't know that I'm different, now? That I'm trying to be a good person? Aw hell, I knew I should have added some back story to that questionnaire...."

&nbsp; 

*Mr. Wexley, I have just killed my husband so that he may join your efforts. It will be nice to see him finally be of use to somebody, for once.*

*Mrs. Vail*

&nbsp; 

"Oh no. And they thought **I** was the evil one. Please, please be the only one like this..."

&nbsp; 

*Wexley, in the ashes of the local prison, you will find 8 perfectly good, slightly dry, bodies for your effort. I figured they were criminals, anyway, so what's the harm!*

 

*Constable James*

&nbsp; 

"This whole town has lost their damn minds!"

&nbsp; 

*Mr. Sir Necomaner, I wil kill my bruther for you. He is stinky and I hat him!*

&nbsp; 

"Please let this madness end."

&nbsp; 

*I am happy to offer you the services of the morgue, my dear Wexley, and the many bodies that come my way are yours to be had -*

&nbsp; 

"Oh good, finally a respite. Wait, there's more here..."

&nbsp;

*- and in order to speed up your efforts, I will cull the weak and the lame in all our sweet village. For the defense!*

&nbsp; 

"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"

&nbsp; 

With a tear in his eye, Wexley bolted from his chair and into the town, in an attempt to quell the madness he has accidentally unleashed upon his village. But yet another tragedy would await him upon his return:

 

He had spilled his cocoa.

For years Jeff had spent hyping up his family's greatest gift to his girlfriend Jess, who eventually became his wife, and it was finally time. They stood in their kitchen with the box, a decades worth of anticipation wearing on Jess' face, as the lid slowly croaked open. A sense of danger and a small cloud of dust slowly wafted from the box as their restraint disappeared and they looked in the box.

"....................A yo-yo? *Really*, JEFF? THIS is what you spent years getting me excited over?"

"Wait wait, hold on, give it a chance! Let me at least try it, see if it does anything cool. Maybe a visage or something will pop out and give us an explanation if I try to use it."

Jeff slides the ancient string onto his finger, and with shaky form releases the yo-yo on its destined path.

*Ziiiiiip* **SNAP** 

The yo-yo breaks free of its tether and rolls across the floor, gentling bumping against the kitchen chairs before coming to a rest.

"Um. Maybe that's what its supposed to do?"

"You're in idiot, Jeff."

After Jess storms out of the room leaving a trail of frustrations behind, Jeff stares blankly at his disappointing heirloom. 

"That string really seems like a design flaw," he thought to himself as he avoided his emotions. A series "Maybe this..." and "Maybe that..." took up the rest of his afternoon, before eventually giving up the ghost. After finally reflecting on his own disappointments, he went to find Jess to repair their broken strings; at least those he could fix.

Several months later, their disappointed hopes and their frustrated tears now a distant memory, while sleeping peacefully through the night, Jeff was awoken by a strange light.

Groggily, he mumbled "Mom, it's too early for school..." before the scene before him startled him to consciousness. The yo-yo had arisen from its box, now a paperweight on the desk in their bedroom, and it was glowing a dusty shade of red. 

"It is a ghost! Wait, no, it's just floating. Damn it. Well this is something at least but now what to I do?"

With those last words, the yo-yo began to slowly blink on one side, in the direction of the door. 

"There's something out there I need to do?" he, feeling ridiculous, whispered to the yo-yo.

Several violent blinks in quick succession followed, and Jeff had his answer, whether he wanted it or not.

As he was led down the hallway by his family's yo-yo, the sounds of rustling could be heard from the kitchen.

*An intruder!* Jeff thought, remembering that the yo-yo was *supposedly* a weapon, after all.

Standing invisible in the darkness of the hallway with the intruder before him, rifling through random papers, again he whispered: "Yo-yo - guide me."

The magical toy slowly descended into his hand, and began furiously blinking in the direction of the intruder. 

*I really hope this is what it wants me to do...*

With a beautiful throw and a perfect follow-through, Jeff heaved his hope into the back of the intruder. With a quick grunt, followed by deafening silence, the yo-yo slowly melted through the back of the man, and into his body. 

Amid the strange silence, the thief began to glow orange, and then red, and then in an instant ***POOF***. The intruder exploded into a cloud of dust, which then fell neatly into a pile with the yo-yo sitting happily on top.

Still standing in shocked silence in the hallway a half hour later, Jess drowsily popped her head out of their bedroom door. "Jeff? Is that toast I smell? I thought I asked you to stop making panini so late?"

With a goofy yet shocked smile, Jeff simply replied "It *is* a weapon."

After tossing the intruder into the rubbish, the implications began to come to Jeff. *Can I use this somehow? Can I fight crime? Could I really be a hero?* 

As if on cue, Jess asked him as she handed him a cup of coffee "I hope you aren't planning on becoming a vigilante or anything. You're so innocent; I don't want to lose that part of you."

"Well, it did cross my mind -"

"Then we'll have to find a way to do it together. I don't want you getting caught, and I know how excitable you can get."

And find a way they did. Jeff did the actual 'fighting' while Jess did all of the planning and scouting of locations, to make sure they could do their work without being seen. 

Soon, small piles of dust began appearing all across the city, with a little picture on top of the criminal they had just taken out. The years went by, and nobody was any the wiser, but they were safer.

When it was finally time to pass the inheritance to the next generation, they handed it off personally to their great grandson Luke. Seeing a familiar disappointment on his face as he opened the box, Jess reminded: "Read the note that's inside, boy."

&nbsp;

"This may look like a simple, useless yo-yo, but inside it holds the power to become a hero.

Love, 
(As we are most commonly known) Ghost and The Duster."

&nbsp;

With a shocked upturned stare at his great grandparents, suddenly less feeble than they seemed, Jeff excitedly exclaims through a heavy chuckle:

"Come on, boy, we've got some work to do."

Dear Sally, here is some advice for when you are taken (and a little bit for after, too):

**1.** Stay calm! They should only hurt you a little bit. But if you spook them, all bets are off.

**2.** Focus on your breathing. I know your lungs are weak from the bronchitis of your youth, so make sure you consciously breathe.

**3.** You'll be driving for a *long* time with that hood on. Maybe think about all those times you said you'd call, maybe?

**4.** It's just a little blood! Just wash with cold water; warm water will cook it because of all the protein, and it'll be harder to get out.

**5.** ***Don't*** mention your bad knee. These guys are like piranha. You'll be better off if you don't give them a target.

**6.** Tell your kids you love them, for goodness sake!

**7.** Stay loose and flexible. You'll be tied up to a lot of different things over the course of this, no doubt, so don't tense up. Don't want you tearing a rotator cuff!

**8.** Don't mention your investment portfolio. Obviously.

**9.** Maybe have mother over to *your* house for Thanksgiving for a change, hm?

**10.** Be quiet. These are sadists; they'll get more of a kick if you scream.

**11.** Don't make eye contact - don't want to seem like you're challenging their authority.

**12.** **Always. Pay. Your. Debts.**

With love,

Your brother Sam.

"We sure did create a beautiful boy, didn't we, Jame?"

"We sure did, Tilda. Breathtaking!"

*These simpletons! Why do they keep talking of me so lovingly? Can they not tell I'm evil?! Surely my face must show it!*

"Look at his little nose! And his tiny furrowed brow. The spitting image of you as a babe, Jame!" 

"But he has your eyes, love!"

*The only eyes I have are the Dark Lord's! UGH. I must try to communicate with these dolts!*

"Goo guh, blub fffffffffffffffp."

"D'aw! He's trying to communicate already! I bet he's saying 'I love you, Papa!'"

*NO! I HATE HIM! HOW WAS THAT NOT CLEAR*

"Aw, look at that little scowl! Reminds me of your Gradnpa Luke, Tilda!"

"Oh Jame, stop!"

*I must try to get away.*

"Oh look at those little arms move! I bet he's going to be a knight like his papa, with all that strength."

"I can only hope, dear; but I'll be proud of him either way!"

**Year 1**

*Crawling has proven a successful reconnaissance tool. I think I've even been able to learn a few words earlier than expected. Then they will know who I am!*

"Hey Jame, I think the Tom is trying to get your attention; did you see that scurry over to you?"

"I did! What's up, little guy?"

"I kill pop!"

"Aww, looks like we got a little rebel on our hands love!"

"Your father Charles said you had a bit of that in you too when you were younger, Jame."

"I know, I know. Apples don't fall far from the tree, I guess!"

*I'M NOT AN APPLE I AM ZERUL MASTER OF DARK ARTS, WITCHER OF THE HIGH LANDS. Oh. Wait a minute...oh no.*

"Uh oh, I think Tom is getting ready to tell us something, dear."

"Poop!"

"*Sigh* I'll get this one, hon."

**Year 3**

"Zerul! Zerul!"

"I know, I know Tom. I know what you are, now. But you still have to eat your peas."

"No! *throws peas at Jame* Zerul evil! No peas!"

"But how are you going to grow big and strong to be a mighty knight if you don't eat your vegetables?"

*Why does he want me to still grow big and strong if he knows I'm his nemesis? What is this lunacy?*

"Come on, Tom. Er, Zerul. Here comes the dragon, with a bowl of peas on his back! *swooshy sounds*"

*I do love this dragon trick. Even evil creatures enjoy a good whimsy or two. I guess I will reward his effort and eat some peas.*

**Year 5**

"I'll kill you someday, dad!"

"I know, son. But come now, we have to find a present for mom for her birthday. You were always better at finding the Majesty Gems; you seem to have an eye for this sort of thing."

"Let's go to my old lair. Gems there!"

"Alrighty. Do you want me to take the training brackets off your pony? Are you feeling confident?"

"Ugh. Yeah."

"Okay, now let's go get that gem. Your mom will be so happy!"

**Year 7**

"Hey Zer, want to have a catch?"

"Sure! An ***EVIL*** catch!"

"*Laughing* Okay boy, as you like."

"Why do you keep doing all this stuff? Don't you think I'll run away once I'm strong enough?"

"You might, but you might not. But either way, I need to love you. Somebody needs to. What a crime to go through this life without being loved."

*How did he know...*

"Love is weak! But I'm evil. I'm going to throw this ball ***SO*** hard dad, watch out!"

**Year 13**

"Hey mom, weren't you ever worried I was going to fight you and dad? I mean, you realized I have powers, surely. What made you think I wouldn't hurt you?" 

"Well, your dad did manage to beat you once, you know."

"Yeah..."

"Either way, you were always going to do what you were going to do. Just because you are what you are didn't make you any less our son. Whether it was you or whatever spirit you replaced with your magic, we always promised to make our boy know he was the world to us. And that's what you were; and still are."

*Zerul, thankfully, continues to chop his onion* "I - I guess I get that. But I'm still going to be the new Dark Lord, someday."

"I bet you will!"

**Year 18**

"So where did you decide to go now that you're done with Knight School, Tom?"

"To the Tidal Lands of Kemur, I heard the Dark Lord has been causing dimensional tremors there. Somebody needs to help."

"You ended up stronger than you were before, truly. I'm proud of you, son. Always will be."

"Even when I kill you, someday?"

*Chuckling* 

"Always."

"Uh," was all I could get out for some time. Enough that she knew I was there, at least. Though like the silence, my embarrassment grew.

"It's okay, Mr. Stranger, I understand. I'll wait for you."

*I'll wait for you.* I had heard this from somebody long ago, though the circumstance escaped me. The rigors of the end of the world have a way of making you forget.

"Sorry to keep you. It's been a while since I've heard anything but those automated scraps reply to my queries. I haven't kept you waiting for hours, have I? My pocket watch says its only been two minutes, but it sure felt like hours."

"It did, didn't it? But no, been but mere minutes, my strange sir. May I assume you're talking about the room for rent?"

"Well, I guess I am, now. You see, calling numbers has become a pass time of sorts. Dialing the days away has helped keep the little humanity I feel inside in tact. I guess it's paid off in spades this time!"

"Lucky you!"

*"Lucky me." she thought to herself*

"I suppose I could take a look at the place. No lack of places to live these days, but it would be nice to match a face to the voice. Shall I bring anything? I do have an abundance of tea."

"I think all we few who are left have more than enough tea, these days. No, you can just bring yourself. I trust you know where to go if you saw the sign. I'll wait for you."

*I'll wait for you.* There it was again. What was it about this that seemed so familiar?

I moseyed on through the town, meandering my way through the rubble and the streams flowing from the hydrants. It almost felt like what a serene walk through the forest may have felt like, if it were filled with the remnants of a suburb. As I strolled up to the building, I rang a bell that tolled all too familiarly, before hearing the foreign sounds of shoes on wood coming my way."

"Ah, you must be Mr. Stranger, then?" my strange mistress exclaimed as she opened the door. 

"In the flesh!"

"Please, do come in Ma...my sir."

With an odd sense of comfort I strolled into the living room. A pink reclining chair in the corner; the soft smell of cedar wafting from the fire place; a weary looking couch beneath a curtained window. 

"This is a lovely place, I must say. I've been a bit of a nomad since the Star Fall, living in plenty of shacks and old plaster boxes with no roofs. Nothing to complain about, I suppose, and at least I always had a view of whats left of the moon."

"Yes, it is quite a lovely home. It's one that was built with love. Cheesy as it may be, I like to think that's what allowed it to survive."

"I don't think that's cheesy one bit! It reminds me of something, in fact. Couldn't tell you what, though."

"I'll make us some tea. Have a look around upstairs, if you will. If you're going to be my room mate, best you know what you're getting into!"

A smart idea, no doubt. I creaked my way up the stairs, photo-less frames lining the wall as I went. *Memories chosen to be forgotten; how strange* I thought emptily. Dark blue walls met me at the top of the stairs. A room on the right, a room on the left, and a water closet at the end of the hall. 

In the room on the right, a dusty crib lay in the corner, with a mobile of the planets quietly, slowly spinning. A turned over lamp, and a dresser leaned over by its missing leg were the only other inhabitants. 

The water closet proved a cozy reprieve after such a long days journey with no stops, and an abundance of tea.

The room on the left appeared to be the main bedroom, as it was kept up neatly. A freshly washed blanket, strewn with delicate flowers lay invitingly. It felt like eternity past since I'd seen something so comfortable. Knick-knacks and books filled clean shelves. And up against the far wall, lay a dresser with a familiar object gently laying atop. 

"My hat!" I exclaimed.

*My hat?* I thought. What did I mean by that?

"Tea's ready!" I heard coming up the stairs.

"So do you think you're interested?" my strange lady questioned as she handed over a steaming mug of Earl Grey.

"Ouch ouch...Yes, I believe I am! This place does something strange to me, I must say. I'm even finding things that I believe are mine, but can't possibly be. If nothing else, I wish to stay for the curiosity!"

"Good, it will be nice to have you here."

"How much will it be?"

"No charge; my home is free for those who belong."

Surely seeing the utterly confused gaze upon my face, my new roommate strode across the kitchen and pulled something from behind one of the jars on the counter top. It was a picture from one of the frames, which she gently handed to me.

"This is us, Mark, about a week before the Fall, and about five days before you left to join the effort. That's baby James, he...didn't survive. My name is Helen; I'm your wife."

"Boy, some phone call that turned out to be! How, though? What? How did you know I would call? Were you playing dice with the universe? Not even God does that!"

"My chances were pretty good. Your general lived, and he told me you did, too. Though you had lost most of your memories. Something about the waves from the Fall and how it affected the brains of the few who lived. But given the state of things, they lost track of you. I knew you were out there. I had hope that you wouldn't have gone far from home, and still knew how to work a phone. What else did I have to try but hope?"

"So that is my hat upstairs."

"Yes, love."

"But, what if I never remember? What if I'm too broken? Can you live with me if I treat you like a stranger? Wouldn't that hurt you too much?"

"As I told you, long ago; I'll wait for you."

From there, the pieces slowly started to come back, and I knew I'd love her again, someday.

Any and all feedback welcome!This story came to me via /u/Dadadadada10 , from a comment they stumbled across in a different part of reddit. This is the source material: 

>"I lived in a small town (2000-2500 people) in the Midwest, when suddenly 1/4th of the population up and left. No notice, no nothing. None of the papers said anything about it. This happened when I was young and I just remembered it that some day one of my teachers just left overnight. Most belongings were gone, just mabey a mattress or table left."

The below admittedly probably isn't my best work, but it was my first go at attempting something that was explicitly sent to me for the purpose of creating a story, so it was a fun little challenge. Not that much different than responding to a normal writing prompt, perhaps, just with a little more pressure. In any case, enjoy! 

&nbsp;

It takes a village to raise a child. I had often heard that idiom from my parents, grandparents, and folks about town when I was a small child. I never really took the time to understand it - at its core is a fairly basic sentiment. The values, aspirations, and path of a child are entirely their own, as there are many wells from which they draw. I understood that clearly, even from a young age, and very much valued that knowledge that many cared enough about me to invest in who Id become. And that is why it hurt so deeply when much of the village disappeared. 

On an otherwise unspectacular summer evening, the landscape of my whole town changed. Families went to bed whole and woke up broken. Friends and neighbors that only the night before had fellowship over hot dogs and lemonade would never gather again. A quarter of the population vanished without a trace leaving behind only memories that proved they once existed. At first, many denied that anything had even occurred. Theyll be back soon, the majority said in their various ways. This is their home, after all. 

You see, we werent used to much of anything happening so quickly. Time moved more slowly in my rural farming town. Not literally, of course, but the pace with which we all went about our lives was different than what you might find in a more demanding environment. The summer sun would hang long into the evenings, and the winter moon would begin its long watch in the early afternoon. It only came naturally that the Departure as itd become known would work the same way. Theyll be back soon, was merely a vague way of saying they would come back eventually. They had to - even the long summers found their closure. It was only after many months did the reality of the situation become, well, reality. Time held not the things that we deemed sacred, and they were never to return. 

We kept on as well as we could, given the circumstances, but there was an underlying acceptance that our little village was for this peculiar destruction. The fabric had torn, and we didnt have the skills to sew it back together. Many hands make light work, was another often repeated idiom that had now taken a cruel turn, as we dealt with the burden of missing hands. 

Few were eager to admit it, but when pressed, they would admit to the fear with which they lived. What if it happens again? would be a common refrain. Why should we bother keeping on if were meant to be destroyed? was another. That mentality would end up becoming the strongest, most unifying force in the community within those first few years. That unity led to an exodus of our creation, as many would decide to flee in the end. The small initial Departure that had been thrust upon us was working its way to completion under our guise. 

A few did our best to inspire and rebuild the social bonds that once glued the village together. I grew up and had children of my own, but they started their lives in a vastly different atmosphere than I had mine. The values I instilled grew shallow and weak roots in their hearts, and they found little water and sustenance from others in the way I had. In time their hearts, too, turned from the village and dreamed of lands far away - cities, beaches, mountains. In their faces, I saw the death of the place I held so dear. But it was their right to choose, and I aided in their departure as each became ready. As I returned home from moving my youngest son into his apartment in the city, I could hear the death knell ring out in the streets. It was only a matter of time.

I write this brief history as a member of the last generation: those who are unfortunate enough to remember the time when we were whole, as well as the fractures that would eventually lead to the demise of my beloved village. Though we will yet remain for a short amount of time, we will surely soon be gone. As a youth, I enjoyed the tails of ghost towns, but to watch the place which you love becoming one is a tragedy like few others. Whoever, whatever, sent us down this path has achieved their goal in our destruction.The original thread:

Keep up, Tommy! You cant fall behind!

The world had long since ended, but there were still terrors worse than death that roamed the empty plains of Earth. 

My legs, Bill. They dont have much left. 

The Night was patient. Though the Sun could still prove a shelter for those in need, the Night knew it only needed to wait for the planets turn, which would provide its sustenance. 

Look, Tommy, we can see the next Bright Zone from here! Its only a few more miles. Come on, stay with me, we can do this.

These were mans last stand, the huts of artificial lights to protect weary wanderers such as these. But even there was hope a temporary illusion - light bulbs have a lifespan after all. 

Maybe its not as bad as we think, Bill. I mean, the screaming always dies down, right? Maybe the Night is a temporary misery compared to this constant one. I need to rest for a minute.

Even amid the light, the Nights power grew stronger as the sunlight waned and dipped behind the distant hills. It could convince a man that the Night was on its side; Stockholm Syndrome to the nth degree. Humans were such easy prey.

Get up, Tommy! Here, hold on to my shoulders. Ill drag you as long as I can to give your legs a break. I cant lose you, Tommy - not yet, not ever.

The bond of family, especially siblings, was always an unusual and curious foe. The Night reveled in the thrill of the challenge and coveted the sweet tears of failed desperation.

Bill, its no use. Im ready to go. We survived longer than most. Isnt that good enough? Come on, just let the Sun set. Die with me. 

The Night encroached further in anticipation. Its hunger would find satisfaction on this evening, and only one question now remained. Would it be a meal of one or two? 

Tommy! Please, Im begging you. We were supposed to do this together! We promised each other we'd never stop fighting. We can still win, but we have to keep moving. Here, let me carry you.

The aroma of tragedy filled the Nights being, sending shivers down its ethereal fabric. Though it could feel remorse and pity, it simply chose not to as emotions spoiled the flavor.

Bill, enough.

Though a mere hundred yards away from the shelter of light, a limp, defeated body could be seen falling from the arms of a desperate brother. The Sun would soon set. 

Tommy

Run, Bill. Now.

The quick feet of the younger brother found their way to the light just as darkness rose in the Suns absence. Mere moments later, the Night struck, and the cries began in earnest.

Bill, wait! Help me! Please come ba-

But it was too late. Night had fallen, and it had only just begun.The original prompt [Don't tell me the odds. Just tell me where to go.

Being a member of The Guard was the highest honor one could attain, aside from being royalty itself. Our names would be remembered in the history scrolls - hopefully in victory, of course, but even being recorded on the losing side wasn't a tragedy. The only true tragedy was being forgotten entirely. 

Though the position had such obvious high points, it naturally had its valleys as well. Chief among them was distance. Once the call was answered, whatever life you had once lived could only be reached via memories and an occasional letter. Wives, children, friends, all became washed out under the bright light of duty. There was much to gain for one in my position, but the sacrifices were many, as well.

In my case there was one extra wrinkle of complication. Alongside the wife and the children I had been forced to leave behind, I had also left behind a pet of some significance. A very special breed of canine made of solid mountain and ivory. They were colloquially known as Mountain Dogs, though their true designation had been lost to time before humanity even existed. They were exceedingly rare creatures, but impossibly friendly once you looked past their intimidating stature. I had left ours in the strong, capable hands of my wife, and was quite sure they'd be just fine. 

But, as the saying among my people went, 'The greatest chaos comes from the smallest scrolls.' I received one such scroll on a day like any other from the rushed arms of the Guard's messenger. Though such a simple message, its three little words held enough weight to put all the world's kingdoms on edge. 

"*Samson has escaped.*"

I knew at once the scene I'd find when I next saw my old friend. Tiny, inconsequential men, poking and stabbing its feet raw in blind self defense. For many, creatures such as Samson existed only in myth, and those myths were rarely kind to the creatures who held the upper hand. I feared not for my friend itself; it could not be brought down so easily. But I feared the men who it would erase from the land's memory, simply by accident, as it wandered wherever its whim should guide. And more than anything, I was afraid I'd lose my pet. 

And so on word of mouth I made my way out into the valleys. My horse was swift, but not as quick as my mind, as it played through all possible scenarios. But the distraction proved helpful as the anxious moments ticked by. In what felt like no time at all, I saw an unusual flock of birds stir above a distant mountain's peak. I at once knew what lay behind the curtain of that range - my good boy.

The last bit of relatively short distance felt by far the longest. As I drew closer I could hear the battle cries of confused men fighting that which they did not understand. Every now and then the deep bellow of Samson's sighs rumbled down through all surrounding lands, his frustration apparent. "I'll be there soon, boy," I'd try to encourage from afar. 

I rounded the final turn, and the scene I had predicted played out before my vary eyes. The glint of spears and swords being put to work shone brightly in my eyes. The blood of those accidentally slain pooled into small streams, watering the fields with the life of brave men. I shouted at the coalition of kingdoms who had gathered in this war, their fervor halting at once upon being recognized as one of The Guard. 

Along with the battle, Samson had stopped his wandering as well. I could see recognition in his eyes, and whatever smile he was capable of making slowly crossed his face. I looked at his feet, bruised, bleeding and raw. "I'm so sorry, Samson. I'm so sorry..." was all I could say, as I rubbed what parts of flesh I could find that had not been pierced. 

I had left much behind when I had taken up my call to guard this world. The weight of all those memories, those sacrifices, fell squarely on me once more. And I knew in that moment that there was yet one great, final sacrifice I had to make. Though the call to The Guard could not be ignored it was, in theory, possible to be leave, though it had never been done before. And so I knew that when history looked back upon me, it would remember neither the victories or the defeats. I would be 'The One Who Left.' And to my great surprise, I found I did not mind. Some things are more important than history, after all. 

And so, I looked once more upon the battlefield, upon faces even more confused than when I had first arrived. With that final memory made, I uttered the last words I would ever say in the battlefield: 

"Come on, boy. Let's go home."The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

Sometimes we get it wrong. It's an open secret around the Pole, you might say. We think we're impossibly pure due to the strange magic that sustains our existence, but we know it isn't true. We like to think Mr. Claus is only drinking an impossible amount of hot cocoa, but we know it's a harder drink. We pretend that Mrs. Claus only has eyes for her jovial, but we know its all a show. And us Pole-Ice like to imagine that we're the defenders of the truth, upholding The List in a faithful manner. But we know we make mistakes; some being worse than others.

I was only a fresh cadet when I was assigned my first section of The List. Only 25,000 kids, but it still felt like a big deal at the time. *They trust me!* I recall thinking. *They must really believe in me!* I was so naive back then, and so full of optimism. I was a just another link in the chain who believed he could never be broken. 

The work was easy. Review the file, and check a box. "Good" and "Naughty." How do you screw that up? You get cocky, cold, and assured of your own mechanical infallibility is how. And so as time goes, you miss a word or two on the file. You start rolling the dice a little bit more. But still you're sure, confident you're checking the right boxes. But once in a blue moon, it'll happen - you'll roll snake eyes. You rarely ever even know, as most lives aren't determined on such a singular event. But sometimes you'll send a life down a new path, one that will eventually circle back to you.

I spent the next thirty-two years slowly working my way up the chain. I was now Head Detective. I rarely interacted with The List any more, except for the most severe cases. "Lifers," we'd call them - names that had been on the list for so long, that their case would receive one final, definitive review. One last chance to be deemed Good, before being labeled Naughty forever.

One day a file appeared on my desk while I was out grabbing a cocoa. I came back and realized what it was. "Poor sap," I thought as soon as I saw the file. Rarely did I ever give a positive review on these cases. My nickname around the office was Coal Mine, and I admit it was a fair one. But as I sat down, something felt different about this one. It was in the name - "Scott Felshaw" - it felt...familiar. 

I called out to the clerks. "Have I seen this one before?" 

"No, new one - just came up from Records last night."

A mystery, to be sure. But something kept nagging at me. All the evidence in the file indicated what the verdict should be. This guy was a real piece of work, nothing but a life of crime. That didn't stop this runaway train of a feeling, though. Something wasn't right, and I was going to find it. 

I spent days scouring every detail of the file. Cross-referencing every crime, looking for any piece of evidence suggesting that some injustice had been committed. No such luck - humanity had done its due diligence for once and dealt with Scott appropriately. Yet I still couldn't give my verdict. I was sure a mistake had been made, and that I was the only one who could find it. And in the middle of the night, my eyes heavy with sleep, the breakthrough finally came. *What if I'm the only one who can find it, because I'm the only one who could have made it...*

I made my way down to records and began searching through my own. Every year, every copy of The List was now up for review. *Please, don't be mine...* I begged. But there, thirty-one years earlier, I found it. I found Scott's name. I checked the previous six years of his life and found he was 'Good' in all of them. But in his seventh year I marked him as 'Naughty.' I wasn't quite sure why, so I looked at his specific file for that year, and found the following:

&nbsp;

*Scott pushed his little brother during an argument over a toy, causing the brother to break one of his fingers...*

&nbsp;

Okay, so I hadn't made a mistake - that was a perfectly naughty act. Even my mind that was surely on autopilot at that point would judge that appropriately, I was sure. But then I noticed there was more.

&nbsp;

*...he felt miserable for his mistake, and apologized several times over, and even gave his favorite toy to his brother as he knew it would be a source of cheer.*

&nbsp;

I...had missed it. I'd made a mistake. I checked the file for the next year, and noticed that a seed of bitterness had been planted within young Scott's heart. I had been the one who marked him for injustice, and he had taken that mark and made it truly his own. The sadness and the depravity only increased as the years moved forward, until he found himself caged for the rest of his life. 

Upon finding that I was the source of this great evil, I recused myself from the case. Before I could be placed on administrative leave, I resigned from the force. Someone else surely gave him his final Naughty verdict, I was sure - but they should have given it to me, too, if my name could've been placed on the list. I deserved to be given a sentence in a coal mine, as I had given to so many others. At least my nickname was still appropriate. 

The Pole moved on and forgot about me. My error buried under a mountain of snow and bureaucracy that never cared about correcting the types of behaviors that needed such burial. I never gave up on trying to fight against it, though, hoping someone would believe me. But every worker, every official, and even Mr. Claus himself would only give me the same hushed reply:

I am the one who lurks beneath,

Who inspires all your fears.

The quiet thoughts and deepest frights,

That linger through the years.

&nbsp;

You see me not but know me well,

Youve seen my shadow in the flame.

But through your screams you never hear,

As I announce to you my name.

&nbsp;

I never meant to cause such harm,

To leave a deep and painful mark.

You looked in need and in duress,

Sitting alone and in the dark.

&nbsp;

To have a friend was all I wished.

To run, to play and dance so free! 

Though what I am keeps dreams at bay,

Always to be your enemy.

&nbsp;

But still Ill hope, wait and see,

Should my true colors become known.

Until then, Ill be scared, too,

Cause I dont want to die alone.The original thread:

I came to life with that first long exhale. Air and sentience filled my body as my senses came to life. My creator was unaware that along with every breath, they were giving me a little more of their life. Mere seconds ago, I was static, limp, and unimportant. But now, I was born.

Before my first thoughts began to form, I felt my body begin to float. As my awareness came to me, I realized I was in a large room. A couch, a television, and something called a La-Z-Boy chair were my neighbors. As I ascended toward the heavens, I heard a high pitched yell: Dont let it get away! 

In an instant, my reality and hope were pulled downward by the force of a hand. Got it! a deep, confident voice uttered. The source of the sound than began tying a string to my base. *My first clothes!* I thought to myself, naively.

I soon found myself dragged away from the world that I had known; the warm comfort of the living room now faded from view and memory. Still yet innocent, I must admit I enjoyed the ride. I bobbed and weaved through the currents of air, bouncing unpredictably with each gentle tug from my owner. 

The journey felt an eternity, but still quickly came to an end. We came to the side of a long gravel road, where my creator stopped and tied me to a board covered in strange markings. I searched the depths of my sentience to decipher the message. And as I floated above, the meaning of the characters slowly descended into my mind.

Joeys Birthday Party!

I knew not of Joey, but I trusted he lived in the same place where I was born, as the arrow beneath the words suggested. 

In foolish hope, I waited for someone to return and fetch me out of the cold air. A familiar voice, a remembered hand, even this Joey would suffice. Alas, my savior would not come, and I feared my short life would end how it began: empty, lifeless, and alone.

But then a strange beast sauntered up to the sign that had become my prison. With a wagging tail and floppy ears, the creature let out strange sounds. Rrrrrr ruff! Bruff! If my movements were my own, I would have shown startlement! But fear quickly turned to hope, as the beast began to nudge and tug at my string. *A chance! Maybe I can yet truly live!* 

Within moments I could feel my binding loosen, and my body began to rise once more. And with one last swipe from my heros paw, I felt myself become finally untethered. 

As I float higher, I know I will soon die as I can feel my body slowly empty. But to have lived at all is a great gift. It may have been the only one Ill ever have, but this was the best birthday I could have ever imagined.The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

On the far side of the valley the battle cry of the approaching army could be heard. The dark waves of armor clad men appeared as though a storm cloud were boiling over the sides of the mountain. Trumpets and horses and the banners of the would be conquerors announced the immanency of the coming doom. 

Meanwhile, in the village...

"Mary, what's that noise?"

"Looks like an army, dear."

"But I was just going to make us some sandwiches!"

"I know, James, but it's *you're* the ambassador, after all."

"Fine..."

The army braced knowing their war cries would bring forth the village's champion. They readied themselves as the town's gates finally opened, revealing the man who would negotiate the fate of the inhabitants of the valley. The previous war cries were silenced with a collective gasp at he who rode out to meet them.  

"Is he, is he wearing slippers?" the invading general queried.

"Um, hello." James yelled over the silence. "We won't be surrendering. We'll be fine. I suggest you leave, before the inevitable doom or destruction or whatever hits you."

"*Excuse me?!*" the general spewed incredulously. "You are in no position to make such assertions, sir! You, a man on a donkey, a man with no shoes, a man without even any *pants*, speaks of our fate?"

"Yeah. Trust me, we've been through this before. You'll attack, the sky will rain lightning or the ground will swallow you up or some weird dragon will attack you. As soon as you even shoot an arrow at us, the battle will be lost for you."

The general commanded an archer to release a single, spiteful arrow in the towns direction. Before the arrow had even reached the peak of its ark, it along with the archer burst into flames.

"What magic is this?!" exclaimed the general.

"It's all part of the story or something. Okay, I'm going to go back to my sandwich. You guys do what you want; you know the risks, now."

James turned his donkey around and strolled back towards the village. The incensed general, his pride now wounded, became blinded by rage. With a blood curdling shout he commanded his men to attack. A flurry of arrows and the stomping of the cavalry's hooves could be heard streaming towards the peaceful village. A stray arrow managed to clip on of James' slippers, knocking it off of his foot.

"Damnit."

The invading army approached the village full force with wild shouts and arrogant cries of their presumed victory. The flaming archer from mere moments ago already forgotten, but it was he who prophesied their fate. Soon the cries of victory were replaced with those of agony, as the army ran into headlong into a mysterious wall setting ablaze all who drew near. 

Amid the screams, James arrived back home. "Mary, send word to Clemons. Cleanup shall take quite a while this time, I believe."

The general watched as his army was consumed by the flames. Being of honorable blood, he did not slow down his horse, and followed his men into their fate. Whatever cruel god had sent them to this fate it no longer mattered; but he and his army would move on into the darker realms as one. 

His final words on this mortal coil which now surrounded him in fire, were ones that had been uttered by countless others before who had all met a similar fate. "I hate plot armor..."

Meanwhile, within the serenity of the village, James began his most difficult task of the day: the search for new slippers.The original prompt:

A permanent dusk hung within the Fever. I knew it was my light that was disappearing over the horizon, but that knowledge only produced more fear. I had a thought that fear fed the encroaching darkness an even deeper strength, but I didn't have time to sort through my emotions. I had to find a way out of this, and find a magic that could make the Sun rise in the night.

There was no shortage of interesting people who lived within the Fever. Merchants, sailors, peasants, jesters, smithies; basically everything you'd expect in this type of setting. Curiosity almost got the best of me on several occasions, as there was a certain mystery in their eyes that I found very appealing. But again, I was short on time, so I had to make my conversations count. I only hoped that whatever stereotype I had conceived for wizards was true, and that they'd possess the magic I sought. 

In my quiet panic, I eventually saw who I was looking for on the far side of the market square. The blue and purple robes, and lavish hat, a staff with some kind of glowing gem at the top - *jackpot,* I thought. I quickly made my way through the sea of villagers, hoping for just a few more minutes of dusk.

I had never been good at first impressions in my home world, so it shouldn't have surprised me that the same was true in my little Fever world, too. As I hustled to my target, I couldn't help but embarrass myself. "Wizard man!" "Mr. Sir Wizard" "Magic guy!" I yelled out in my sprint. I could tell the wizard heard me by way of his laughter; a good omen, I hoped.

"Ah, the new arrival, then." said my hero.

"I guess so! The name is Winston. Yours?" I squawked through panted breath.

"Corazon, good sir. But you can call me Cory - I know your time is precious, so the syllables count!"

"Thanks, Cory. Please, I-"

"I know, Winston. I know. You don't want to die. You don't think this dusk would surprise me, do you?! Come, I'll show you what you seek." 

For the first time in what felt like years since I began my journey in the wilderness before I eventually found this village, I felt safe. I was going to live, and turn the tears of anguish on the face of my wife and daughter into tears of joy. The Sun would soon rise.

Cory led me down a small path on the opposite side of the village from which I came. It seemed somehow darker, though I knew that to not be the case. In the distance a decrepit spire, the building at its base protected with a black iron fence.

"So, what kind of magic will save me? Do I need to make some kind of potion, or will that gem in your staff purify whatever sickness I have? There isn't more to this quest, is there?"

"Mm, I think you're asking the wrong questions, Winston. I do have answers, but not to that which you have asked about. Just a little further, now."

We reached the edge of the fence, and through its bars I could see tombstones. An old fear gripped me anew.

"What...why did you bring me here, Cory?"

"This is where you can find answers, of course."

"But I was searching for a way to live. This is just a graveyard. How does that hold the key to living?"

"It doesn't, Winston. And to be more specific, you were looking to see if you *could* live. There was always the possibility that the answer would be no. Which it is! You are going to die, and there isn't anything I can do about it. Well, that's a bit of a fib. There isn't anything I *want* to do about it."

"*What?!* You could save me, but you won't?!"

"Precisely. I need a new apprentice. Not every day someone shows up in my realm who already believes in magic, let alone someone who would seek me out. Nobody in town believes I'm a wizard; they just think I'm crazy. But you believed in me. I think you might prove useful, Winston."

"Bu-"

"Now, now. Time for you to go. But don't worry, I'll see you soon."

In an instant I was transported back into my body on Earth. I could hear and feel what was happening, but I could do nothing to respond. I heard the doctor's final commands, by family's last goodbyes, and then it was dark. Familiar, yet different; final.

I then awoke within a different realm of familiarity. I had control of my body once more, and opened my eyes to a pitch black sky. The Sun had truly set. 

As I sat up, there was only light I could see in any direction. A small glowing gem, at the end of a staff, illuminating a blue and purple robe and a lavish hat.

"Welcome back, Winston. Now, let's get to work."The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

I thought it would be an easy, lucrative life. I would be fed and paid handsomely for my 'trouble.' Everybody has secrets, mostly dumb stuff that they wish to keep hidden away no matter how benign they might be. And for a while it was that easy. But even as a monster, I underestimated the capacity for darkness within my clients, and the apple proved to be poisoned.

It wasn't until several years in that I got my first taste of what was to come. A man came into my shop, and asked how much it would cost for me to take a childhood secret off his hands. $500 was the going rate for anything over twenty years old, which he was happy to pay. So, we arranged the session in which I would feed, and his mind would be absolved. 

But I wasn't quite ready for what he had to offer. "When I was a kid, my father would hit me if I didn't get the dishes done before my mom got home from work. He'd said she would be disappointed. When she eventually left, he blamed me, and said I should have done a better job."

His secret was delicious, but the aftertaste was sour. Even though I couldn't quite understand his experience, there were shades of recognition in my mind. I may have been an abhorrent creature, but I still had parents. The relationships in our kind were different, but they existed. The secret sat strangely in one of my stomachs, but I didn't pay much mind, and business carried on.

Another year or two went by, and my venture had steadily grown. Word had spread that I could eat even the largest of secrets and not just the riffraff of rumors, and my clientele increased in kind. I was now charging in the thousands for the old, bigger secrets; but hey, I was becoming quite wealthy, and I was always full. Life was good. 

Then one day, a young boy, maybe early teens, strolled into my shop. I thought it would be the usual - I have a crush on this girl or that boy, I cheated on my test, etc. But instead, out came the hundred dollar bills. He carried another surprise, that proved to be another stumbling block. "I hate everyone. I've thought a lot about hurting everyone I know. I don't really want to, I just don't know what to do."

This one was bitter. I absorbed it without even a wince, though I knew from the first taste that something was wrong. The weight had been lifted from this young boy's heart, but its darkness had found its way into my mind. *Like the old tales about humanity...and how we wished they would suffer...* I recalled; ancient tales from my youth, of how my kind once felt of the fleshy pink creatures. Long ago we had learned we could profit off of them, and so our bitterness subsided as our wealth increased. But the ideas were there, planted deep, and I couldn't help think about hate. I didn't much like it, and something like empathy began to arise.

Seasons changed as the time went by, but I noticed my hunger was waning. The flow of secrets never stopped, but I was running out of room. This wasn't supposed to happen, as my body was meant to process them. But the heaviness of some proved to be too strong for me to dissolve, and I was in trouble. But like with most creatures, my greed knew no bounds. And so I pushed on, always looking for that next dollar.

And elderly woman visited one day. I could see in her eyes that she had long been broken, and I was her last hope to find peace. She told me tales of the great abuses she had suffered all throughout her life, and how she had buried them away, as to not be a bother. I was incapable of weeping, but I had seen it from others enough to know that if I were able to, I would have done so then. After a session lasting across the better part of a whole day, she finally said through her tears, "Can you help me?"

Two lives hung in the balance. I knew if I ate her burden, that it would be my last. Though she deserved to finally be free; to feel some sense of safety in what life she had left. And in a moment that went against all I had worked for, I agreed to eat her secret. My kind may remember it as folly; throwing away such a life of well, for one of the humans. But in some ways, I had become like them - or at least could understand. Their suffering knew no limits; their depravity had no bottom, except within me.

The secret burned as it went down. I could feel all of my many chambers within rattle and ache as my body attempted to break down the darkness. I knew it wouldn't win, but my body still tried. The woman quietly strolled out of the shop and down the way, and for the first time in almost a decade, I turned off the 'Open' sign early. I had arrangements to make, including a story to write down.

And so I come to my end. I have no regrets; my family will be set, and other Eaters will be able to take over the business in my wake. Hopefully they'll continue to help the humans, and not turn away from the bitter secret. 

Actually, on second thoughts, I do have but one regret: I only wish I could cry.The original thread:

Speaking at a funeral is an intimidating experience. When Ms. Howard first asked me to do so, I hesitated at first. Who am I to speak on behalf of the dead? What more could I add to a life already so beloved? But going through my notes and letters, I found I had been given me the words to honor her. The ones I believe she would want me to share with you. 

Melissa and I first met in high school. We were what youd expect - convinced that the high drama of our lives was the only thing that did and ever would matter. To sound a bit cheesy, we became each others worlds, in orbit around each other within that universe of drama. And we knew nothing but bliss for those first few months.

And then came the disco dance. Through a series of rumors that made the rounds that night, we both become convinced that we each cheated on the other. It wasnt true, but again, it was high school - it was as though the fabric of all we knew was tearing apart. I remember standing on opposite sides of the gym, staring at each other, wondering where it all went wrong.

Eventually, we came back into each others orbit, and we talked. For the first time, to be honest; at least in regards to a conversation with lasting implications. We were underneath that disco ball for I dont know how long, but looking back, I wish it were longer.

That next Monday, I found a note in my locker at school:

&nbsp;

*A thousand little mirrors,*

*A thousand tiny lights.*


*Who knows what lies ahead,*

*But well always have that night.*

&nbsp;

It was then, for the first time that I recall, being grateful for pain. Going from feeling so alone and hopeless, to somehow being sewn back together... We had both changed by going through that fire; one that refined, rather than consumed.
 
Right now, I think were all in that moment of darkness; that uncertainty of what comes next, and how we should feel. We dont all have disco balls to remind us of a way forward, or to act as an anchor to hold our hearts in place. But I think the idea is helpful. Look to those memories, those mirrors in your mind reflecting a time when you overcame; where uncertainty was replaced by the assurance that you can weather the storm. 

Saying goodbye to a fianc is never easy, under most any circumstance. I along with the rest of you here, will never be quite the same again. But I hope you can find that disco ball or whatever that image may represent for you, to help you find your way forward. I dont know what comes next, but I know Ill always have that night.The original prompt:

"Hey Ralph, can you make the coffee today?"

Life hinges on simple questions. To your average office worker, being asked to make the coffee would seem like second nature. But for me, it was the dawning of a reality which had been dead to me for a decade. I once again possessed the terror of choice. I found myself paralyzed in a familiar yet different way, as my thoughts began to jump over themselves.

*Do I remember how to make coffee? What if I pour in the wrong beans? Wait, don't I do something with the beans first? I'm going to mess this up - the day I've been dreaming about for years, derailed by inability to navigate a bean. Oh come on, I've watched myself make coffee hundreds of times, why is this so hard?*

The seconds felt like hours, and I could feel Howard's confused stare against my skin. I felt a drop of sweat travel down my forehead, and the pressure began to mount even further.

*Howard is going to think you're a moron. A perfectly good employee somehow goes useless after a decade for no reason! No, no, you can do this. Calm down. Think about the beans again, you were so close to figuring it out. But what if Howard tells Martha? Oh noooooo! I've loved her from a distance for so long; what if I lose my chance before I even figure out how to speak again?*

Howard's raised eyebrow was joined by its twin, and the confusion was fading into abject shock. I can't blame him - how would you deal with a coworker falling apart before your very eyes? I opened my mouth as a distraction, feigning that an explanation was forthcoming. But they were idle hopes, as my mind reached back for darker places.

*Why do I miss the Shadow? I tried fighting its control for so long, and I thought it got what it wanted when it finally beat me into submission. But was this its ultimate game? To remove my dignity not only in my eyes but the worlds? Why do I want it back...there was safety in its control. I didn't have to do anything. It dealt with the world, while I got to play in my own. I just want to feel safe again.*

I saw Howard turn and raise his arm, as if to wave someone over. It was then that I knew I was going to have to summon every ounce of bravery left in my shell of a body. I was going to fight once more. The Shadow beat me once, but it wasn't going to happen again. I was going to be victorious - I was going to make the coffee.

*Come on, Ralph. Do it. Say the words. Grab hold the memories. This is your chance. This is for all the marbles - not just a beverage, but ultimately, your chance to find love. DO IT!*

"Sure, Howard, I'll make it today. Where do we keep the filters again?"The original thread:

Assurance awoke on a gravel road soon after being lost. They arose and started to gather their bearings. Behind them, only darkness. Ahead, a long, winding, dusty road. Far in the distance, there appeared the top of a wall whose base lay an untold number of horizons away. Assurance responded pragmatically. Well, only one way to go.

A few years lonesome years went by until one-day Assurance found a figure hiding behind an old, dead tree. Confidence? Is that you?!

...Yes.

Howd you get here?

Our human was attacked by Doubt. They were too strong. The human lost me

Me too, friend. But no need to hide! Youre not alone anymore.

The companions carried on as they shared memories of their human. Years went by slowly but consistently on their march toward the wall. One day they spotted another familiar figure sitting idly on a bench up ahead.

You too, Self-worth?

After our human lost you two, things only got worse. Eventually, they went to sleep, and I woke up here.

The mood was somber, but Assurance was resolute. Were not giving up. Maybe the road will lead us back to our human.

The wall now grew closer. Halfway up could be s see the tops of what appeared to be doors. But their journey trudged on, and many years went by.

Eventually, the three were stopped by a strange sight. A small shadow, gradually growing, lay ahead. Looking up, they saw a wrinkled, elderly figure descending. 

You look terrible, Dreams, joked Confidence. 

Its been a long life. 

How is our human? Assurance inquired.

Theyre not long for their world. Their heart is far too broken.

The friends wept before Assurance again took charge. We need to save them.

As they climbed over the last peak and saw the wall in full, only more terror greeted them. In front of one of the doors stood a vile, towering creature. In its hand a vaguely human apparition, about to be devoured. 

Soul! Hold on! You can beat your demon! Shouted Assurance, as they charged toward the creature.

The battle cry heard, Soul turned and saw the friends running to join the battle. Restored with a will to fight, they fought hard, eventually dealing the demon a fatal blow. The demon dissolved into dust and blew away in the wind. A small key fell to the ground, as Soul descended.

My friends! I thought I had lost you forever!

We never gave up! We only wish we were earlier before your life was over. 

We have another chance. Come follow me!

Soul picked up the key the demon had dropped and walked over to one of the doors in the wall. On the other side, a beautiful meadow; a new world, filled with color and beauty and life.

The friends made their way over to Soul, who once again merged with their long lost owner. Soul then made their way through the door into the afterlife, having been made whole once more.The original thread:

*Chapter 11  "Bird Brained"*

&nbsp;
 
Space vultures weren't the most thoughtful group in existence. Or careful. Or reliable. But they were excellent scavengers and proved to be an essential cog in the intergalactic economy. There was great value in their ability to bring otherwise lost materials back to the market. It was a lucrative if not dangerous occupation.

So, when you stumble upon an Intergalactic Freighter that appears abandoned, asking questions isn't as much of a priority. When Orin Hatchbark, Tully Burka and Sigmund Soren saw the imposing, darkened vessel before them, they pounced. All they could see was what they could gain, and nothing of what could be lost.

"Can you believe how good we are at this? I mean, look at this ship! There's gotta be enough here to last us the rest of our lives!"

"Uh, Orin? Don't you mean that we're lucky? How could we be good at randomly running across stuff like this?"

"That's your lack of confidence talking, Siggy. You have to believe in yourself! Tully, help me pry open this hatch."

The crew made their way deeper into the ship while continuing to bicker about the nature of skill vs. luck. Soon, they found themselves in the armory, in awe of its wonders.

"Tully, Siggy! Look at the size of that hammer!"

"How big could it- oh damn, that *is* a big hammer."

"What do you think it's used for?"

"Probably hammering, Tully."

"Yeah, but what?"

"Does it matter? Let's see if we can lift it."

The trio strained with all their might and found that they could indeed lift the magnificent tool. But soon, the strain took its toll.

"I'm gonna drop it, guys."

"Don't, Tully! Siggy, lift harder."

"I...*can't*"

The hammer fell hard, and a thunderous clang echoed through the supposedly empty ship.

&nbsp;

**Thump**, **Thump**

&nbsp;

"Where's that footstep sound coming from?"

"Probably feet, Tully. Orin, didn't you check for life signs before we came over?"

"Well. Yes and no. I mean, *I* felt alive, but no, I forgot to scan the ship."

"Okay. Run!"

They saw the source of the footsteps round the corner as they hit their stride, but then quickly found it taken away as a gravity rope lassoed them. They settled into their fate.

"Wow, *look* at him! What an Adonis."

"He's going to kill us, Tully."

"I know, Orin, but he's so big and beautiful. Look at the way he picked up that hammer! Oh, so that's what it's for."

"I bet we'll make a very handsome pancake."

"Me too, Siggy. Me too."

The creature lifted his glorious weapon, as the bound friends shared their final thoughts.

"Orin, Siggy - you guys know what would've helped here?"

"Come on, don't say it"

"Seriously, Tully now isn't the ti-"

"*Lasers!*"

The hammer crashed down, and the vultures' lives were lost to the universe. They did indeed, however, make a very handsome pancake.The original thread:

"Skinny Genes! What is *up*, my dude? Aside from this elevator, that is! Haha! up high, guys!"

"Hi"

*Okay, get to the corner. Just have to squeak by Karen's - ah -  shoulders. Okay, safety.*

&nbsp;

"What floor, guy?"

"Oh, uh, 62nd; thanks, Brad."

"No problem, guy."

&nbsp;

*He doesn't know my name. Jeff just yelled it, and they still don't know. I suppose none of them would. I'm just the guy in the corner. Alright, maybe today is the day I say something. Yeah, I think I will! But what? A joke! Yeah. They won't expect it. Do I know any good jokes, though?*

**Ding!**

*Great, now we get more Jeff*

&nbsp;

 Brandon! How are you doing, Bran Flakes? Oh, you *know* I had a big bowl of you for breakfast!


"That is wildly inappropriate, and I don't appreciate it, Jeff."

"Cool cool cool. Uh oh, looks like Lazy Susan's giving  Skinny Genes the stare down!"

*What? Oh, shit, she is. Don't look at her lazy eye, you dolt! But I can't help it. It's so mysterious. What was I thinking about again? Eyeballs. No, ugh, you stupid idiot! You were thinking of jokes. Why is this elevator so slow? More like a hellevator if you ask me. Hey! Hellevator! That'll work. Let's try that.*

"Vomit. A lot of vomit. It looked a lot like you, Jeff."

"Hey, man, words hurt"

*Well, at least he'll be quiet for a while. Now I'll have time to gather my confidence. Okay, what kind of tone do I use? Do I yell it out, or do I need to build into it? Do I smirk first, or is that too self-indulgent? Should I even say it today? What if I need a joke more some other time? No, someone will use it before me, then. Shit, I have to do this. 3...2...1*

We had always been told that we were an inconsequential galaxy. When the stars opened to us and we began to interact and learn from the other beings and races of the universe, they had always given the same report. "You're made of leftovers; stars and matter from the higher classes of galaxy. You were not created with purpose, you merely exist."

It was clear we were but a tiny, ramshackle group of stragglers in comparison to the life that we found elsewhere, so we had no reason to doubt. We were merely happy to know we weren't alone, and that even if we didn't hold a special place, we at least knew that we had one.

And so life carried on through the millennia. The universe and its creatures were more or less kind to us, as they saw us akin to babies. They helped us become more efficient and prosperous, and soon we existed in every system within the Milky Way. We were blessed with more than we needed, and so our galaxy became a mine of sorts for the galaxies above ours. Slowly, our material wealth increased our standing within the universe, and we became fairly respected. Still babies, but respected babies.

That all changed when we found 'One of Them.' On a mining planet like any other, the sands one day shifted, and at first only the stone dome was exposed. Curiosity being one of our defining characteristics as a species, we slowly uncovered more until it became clear what we were dealing with. It was a...giant head.

Unsure of what this meant, we sent queries to all known associate races. This triggered quite a series of communications that lead to a first for our galaxy: a visit from the Council of the Expanse. It wasn't the full council, but four of their members descended on Ammos to inspect the finding for themselves.

Their reaction was, to put it mildly, quite strange. For a week of Earth Standard Time and an unknown amount of time from wherever the council came, the creatures stood before the stone face, watching it. I was there as a representative, and not once was requested to speak or fetch any means of sustenance. We simply...observed. It didn't seem they were trying to learn from it, or figure out what it could be, however. Rather, they seemed shocked into silence by the fact that it existed at all.

Finally, one of the creature's voices rang through the translator in my suit.

"They were created..."

Over the next few EST days, we were informed that this stone head wasn't really stone. It was a fossil, of sorts, but more than that. It was the remnant of a Creator - the being that brought our galaxy into existence. All 'true' galaxies were said to contain one of these remnants, but none had ever been found or was previously known to exist within the Milky Way. And so the rest of the universe assumed we were scraps; rocks tossed aside by other Creators as they built their systems. 

But they were all wrong. It turned out we had been created. This is important in terms of the universe, as it had bearing on our political and economical place within the grander scheme. Created galaxies were held in higher regard, as it was believed that no galaxy was created without a specific purpose.

Nobody knew this particular Creator's name, but we're hoping to find out some day as we continue to dig the site. There may be a clue hidden somewhere within the sand, that will help us know our 'dad' better. But for now, we have enough changes to deal with, as we re-learn our place among the stars, and fill a newly created seat within the Council.

We were no longer considered a second class species, but we still kept our role as a mine for the cosmos. The other races had shown us great kindness, and we had no desire to usurp or displace anyone. We were happy to have a place. 

For humanity, it was enough to know that we were looking on a new era of discovery. We had opened up the stars, discovered our place, and found a functional role within the universe. But now, it was time to discover our purpose.The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

Growing up on a small farm in the plains of Canada, the night time sky was often swallowed up by stars. And like many kids, I dreamed of being an astronaut. "What's *out there*?!" I would ask whichever exasperated parent was holding me for the hundredth time. With great grace, they would always respond, "I'm not sure, James, but I'm sure you'll find out!" 

The call of the stars never departed my ears as I grew older. If anything, I became more resolute in my dreams, and I worked hard to make the theoretical hope a tangible reality. And with time, I was on the cusp.

I had never quite had the credentials or intelligence to become an astronaut proper, but thankfully there were other avenues. Automated mine ships were now commonplace throughout the galaxy. They were smaller, single occupancy ships that would go out for a few months at a time and collect whatever resource was the flavor of the month at the time. I never really cared about the work; I could do it, of course, as the mining itself was mostly automated and I was essentially its baby sitter. But for me, the journey was what mattered. 

And what a journey it was. 

As I entered my first star system that wasn't the one I came from, that familiar call I heard even as a child only grew more intense. It was exhilarating, breath-taking, shocking, awe-inspiring, and confusing. *I made it; I'm here. Why do I still feel the call?* I thought to myself.

Deep in thought, I passed a small cluster of planets en route to my mine, and they provided the answer.

*We knew you'd come.*

I assumed I was getting a bit of space fever, so I simply ignored what I thought was an intrusive thought.

*We've been calling you since you were young.*

That was just a bit too on the nose, so even though it felt a bit crazy, I tried answering the...uh, planet.

"Me? Why me?"

*Space gets lonely after a billion years by yourself.*

"Are you...going to hurt me?"

*No. We just wanted to meet another life. See what you were like. And so we called, and you answered. You may leave whenever you need; our curiosity is satisfied.*

"Are all planets like you? Is that why so many feel drawn to the stars?"

*Yes. Most of us aren't so curious, but the ones that are have a special kind of...gravity, you might say. The calling can be quite strong.*

"Will I still feel it when I have to leave? Will you keep calling me?"

*No, you won't hear our voice any more. Another system's planets, maybe, but not us.*

For the next few months of my shift, the planets and I conversed. I told them of Earth, they told me about themselves. It was all quite formal. Planets don't have much of a sense of humor, it turns out. But none the less, it was more than I ever could have dreamed, even as a kid. 

During the journey home, I noted how the planet was correct. I no longer felt the calling of space. The fullness of my memories of the last few months battled against the emptiness currently present in my soul. For the first time in my life, I felt truly alone.

I returned home a disillusioned man. I wasn't sure what my purpose was, now, or if I even had one. I found a farming job near where my parents lived, just to keep busy.

Then one chilly autumn evening, I decided to make some cocoa and go sit outside my parent's home. It was a beautiful, clear night, where the sky had again been consumed by the sprinkling of distant stars upon its canvas. I sipped my drink, and reminisced about my experiences. The dreams of a child fulfilled as an adult; the grandeur and emptiness of it all. 

And then, like the voice of childhood friend yelling my name outside my house, beckoning me to come and play, I heard them.

The stars were calling me once more.The prompt was deleted as I was writing my response, so I'm not sure if I can link to it. In any case, this was the prompt:

&nbsp;

"You can see the amount of people someone has killed in a floating number by their head. One day you see a man walk into a bathroom with a number of zero. When he comes out, it is 1000."


&nbsp;

He seemed like such a cheery man. When he walked into the restaurant, the cook greeted him by name. "Howdy, Burt! The usual?"

"You got it, Gene!" 

He plopped down his folded paper on a table in the corner where I'm assuming he usually resided. As he made a bee-line for the bathroom, I could here him quietly whistle then sing, "Here comes the sun..." 

I didn't think much more of it at the time, and went back to enjoying my waffles and making small talk with the waitress. But a few minutes later, the man returned from the bathroom, though something had changed. It didn't quite register at first, but then I realized, *he has four digits...*

I felt like a bit of a creep staring at him as long as I did; it had to be for more than ten minutes. But this had never happened before. Occasionally I'd see someone's number switch over by a single digit, *maybe* go up a handful of numbers; but even those were rare occurrences. To see someone go zero to one thousand in minutes was beyond confusing. And it kept rising, too.

All the more strange, the man kept humming to himself as he read his paper and awaited his order. All I could imagine was that something had gone terribly wrong in the life of this cheery, cordial man, and I was going have to be the one to somehow break it to him.

I made my way to the corner, unsure of how this was going to end, but confident that it needed to start.

"Um, excuse me, Burt, is it?"

"Oh, yes! Hello, lad. What's your name? And how *are* you, today?"

"My name is Percy, and I'm...fine. Are you okay?"

"Couldn't be better! The birds are singing, the aroma of fresh waffles is filling my nostrils, and I even got a promotion last night at work! Life couldn't be better."

*Of course...*

"Listen, I don't really know how to explain this, but, well, I think something has gone wrong, Burt."

"Oh? Why do you say that, Percy?"

"This is going to take a while to explain; mind if I move to your table?"

Burt was, naturally, quite amicable and was curious to hear what I had to say. I could have spouted hundreds of pieces of useless trivia, and Burt would have been eager to hear and fascinated by every little bit. He truly was a kind, genuine man. And I needed to break his heart. 

I explained my, uh, gift. Naturally, he didn't believe me at first, but thankfully my gift also works on pictures, so I had him find random pictures of murderers so I could identify their body counts, which he'd then cross-reference. It took hours, but he finally believed me. 

And then it sunk in.

Burt slumped in his chair, his stair looking a thousand yards away. I let the silence mature for a while, as I knew he was right on the edge of sanity. But finally, I had to break the silence.

"What positioned were your promoted to, Burt?"

"Supervisor of a pharmaceutical company, specifically different types of blood thinners. I...was always so careful..."

I believed him. 

"It might sound stupid to you, Percy, but I got into pharmaceuticals so I could feel like I was helping people. I never had the means or the brains to pursue medicine proper, but I wanted to be involved wherever I could. The thought that always got me through the day, was knowing that someone out there was going to be safe. I cared about the people receiving our products as if they were friends, even though I never knew them." 

"I'm sorry, Burt. I know you didn't mean to hurt anyone. Maybe they'll let you off e-"

"No, I won't allow that. I'm a danger, now. I can't be trusted. I'm better off being locked away where I can't hurt anyone. I'll call my boss, then I need to go. Will you bring me to the police so I can turn myself in? I don't want to hurt anyone else on the way there."

The drive to the station was a quiet one. Burt stared at his shoes, while I gazed upon a man who felt betrayed by himself. I couldn't even begin to fathom how I could console him. How do you comfort a man who has killed thousands, all by accident?

I stayed with him for the whole booking process, but again it was all in silence. Eventually they came and walked him down to a holding cell. His back turned to me, his head still bowed, I could tell his soul was nearing an unsalvageable place. And so, I finally found some words to speak; or rather, yell down the hall.

"I'll still be your friend, Burt. Remember my face, and my name - you'll always have me."

He then disappeared behind a corner. I never saw his face, or heard him speak again. But he let me know that even though he was crushed, a kernel of hope remained. As I was walking away, a few whistled bars of "Here Comes the Sun" echoed down the hall.The original thread: 


&nbsp;

It began with a buzz. Standing in my kitchen eating a late-night snack, I heard a familiar sound of summer, the mosquito. While annoying, they were never too much of a bother. But this one was different. This one was stronger, smarter, faster. This one wasnt just out for blood; it was out *for blood*.

It didn't waste time declaring its intentions. A swift bite of the ankle, knee, finger knuckle, all while finding time to hover beside my ear. My anger vibrated in rhythm with my eardrum as the creatures sound made its way deep into my soul.

*Now it was war.*

The creature knew I would flail at every bite, so after its initial strikes, it played a more strategic game. Waiting until I felt comfortable, it would find a way to my skin. No corner of my house proved safe; no sweater nor pant thick enough; no amount of bug spray strong enough. It was going to win the physical battle; it was clear. I had to beat its mind.

From inside my ski mask and rubber dish gloves, I drew a diagram of my house, planning my offensive. *Where would it be the weakest? Where would it not expect me to attack?* ... The kitchen, I whispered. *Itll never expect me to strike where I was at my weakest.*

To lull the bug into a sense of security, I would need to appear to have given up. I took off my facemask, my gloves, my boots, and all five layers of flannel. I heard the creature loudly behind me; a buzz of victory, you might say. He thought the game was over when I had only begun to play.

I grabbed and lit a candle, setting it on my kitchen table. I then made my way to the basement, all the while making sure to itch and complain, hoping the mosquito would be distracted. I heard it happily buzz behind me. *Good*, I thought.  

I shut off the power to my house. Surrounded by darkness and silence, aside from the buzz, I used my phone to light the way back upstairs and stood next to the table.

There we locked eyes for the first time. Hovering above the candle flame and illuminated red, it appeared as evil as its nature. It assumed victory, dominance, ownership over me. But my diversions had worked. 

I quickly pulled the bug spray from my pocket and sprayed the candle while driving through the doorway to the living room. A pillar of flame enveloped the creature. At once I heard its final, violent buzz. 

I laid on the floor, basking in the light of victory, feeling as though I had beaten the devil himself. But then I realized that wasnt the light of victory I was basking in  my kitchen ceiling was on fire.

As I stood outside watching my house burn to the ground, I could only shrug. *Well, it still isn't the worst idea Ive ever had.*The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

A spotlight fell on us from directly above. Off to the right, on the very edge of the shadow, a familiar voice rang out. "Oh gawrsh! This one looks tough. But you got 'em, Mick, ah-hyuck!" 

I couldn't tell if the Mouse heard, or if he was even paying attention. He stared into my soul with cold, lifeless eyes - warrior's eyes - that had seen better men than me fade away. 

With incredible agility he came at me. A left jab followed by a quick right hook. I jumped out of the way, but he tagged my shoulder. Blood from my shirt now marked his gloves. This wasn't going to be easy. 

The dance carried on. In and out of step, we traded a jab for a dodge, a kick for a roll-out, a hook for a step-back. The Mouse's superior skill only matched by my desire to be free. He would win if this kept up; he was drawn too well to hope for a fair fight. And so I took the fight to a different plane.

"You don't have to do this," I said, unsure if it'd even get a response. To my surprise, the Mouse stopped his assault, and again I was met with the abyss behind his eyes.

"I know you've killed before. But why?" I only had the rhetorical at this point, but at least it gave me a moment to breathe. 

The Mouse's eyes didn't waver, and I again had to dodge a flurry of arms. I escaped with my breath, but I knew I was near the end of my strength, and out of ideas on how to distract his mind. But hope came out of the darkness surrounding our halo of light.

Quietly, I again heard that familiar voice. "Gawrsh, I hope he can win this. Maybe then they'll set him free..."

*We're fighting for the same thing,* I realized. I had assumed these characters I had fought were arbitrary enemies, simply brought down here as tools to teach intruders like me a lesson. But they were fighting for their lives, too. Who knows how long the Mouse had been trapped down here, being forced to kill in the hopes of being let out of this cage. 

My fear was replaced with pity. The courage I had built up over the course of my previous victories was replaced with remorse. I had beaten so many minor characters to get to this point; I had cut their storylines short, never to be picked up again. I knew what I had to do. I had to be a light of hope to guide dead eyes.

"You win," I uttered meekly. "I can't fight anymore. Go, be free. Kill me."

The Mouse stopped. A small glimmer flashed across his eyes. 
 
"You've probably been trapped longer than I've been alive. You deserve to be free. I've lived a good life; now's your chance to reclaim yours, Mick." 

His eyes continued to glimmer. I was expecting a charge at any moment; one final blow to knock me out, and open the door the door to his future. *A worthy sacrifice,* I said to myself as I close my eyes, for what I thought would be the final time.

It was the sound of gloves hitting the floor that startled me back to awareness. I opened my eyes, only to see the Mouse's back turned to me, walking away into the darkness, giving me the win.

"Mick, no!" a chorus of voices rang out. "They might erase you!" 

A door opened behind me, with a large cartoon arrow pointing at it, clearly leading me to freedom. The characters who had been watching our fight of fate scattered in the opposite direction in chase of the Mouse, whose fate was now uncertain. 

As I made my way to the light, I stopped and looked back into the darkness. The spotlight still there, with the only remains the smatterings and streaks of my blood, and the Mouse's gloves lying on the floor. I observed the solemnity of the moment; freedom, but at such a cost. 

"Thank you, Mick."The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

I never enjoyed flying. Even before we solved the problem of the speed of light, I would often try to travel by car or by boat whenever I had to do field work. I'm not sure where that uneasiness came from, to be honest; maybe it was just my nature, with my life's work being so close to the ground, and all. But regardless of its origins, fate seemed to enjoy the irony of the hand it was going to deal me.

When the first Light Ships returned with their findings, I was excited just like everybody else was. *What would they find?* was the communal thought of the world. But it was a passive interest for most, as nobody had any reason to believe the findings would impact them in any meaningful way - myself included.

But a few weeks after their return, I received the call. 

They had found a type of *Araneidae.* A fairly large family of arachnid on Earth, but nothing you'd ever expect to find scattered across space. Assuming any commonality between planets, let alone ones separated by galaxies, was a fools errand. But all the ships - twelve in total - reported the same findings. As one of the foremost experts on that family, I was the one who was asked to confirm, and sure enough,  each of the twelve planets contained an araneid. 

"We want you to go on the next mission, Mr. Jonston."

I remember them asking the question, but I don't remember ever giving an answer. The findings and the unknown implications had already had my brain on the edge of being able to function. The thought of adding a faster than light flight to another *planet* pushed me well beyond what I was capable of processing.

Eventually my mind caught up, and all the arrangements had been made. I sold everything I owned, said goodbye to everyone I knew who would likely be dead by the time I returned, and went through the training. I particularly enjoyed the class on "Controlled Vomiting and Light Speed," as I knew it would prove most helpful.

The time for the journey finally came, and my mind was again struggling to process everything. Sitting on the ship waiting for launch, everything came flooding back. The progress we as a people had made; that we had visited other galaxies, stars, and planets; that we had found life; and that I was now somehow part of this great web of discovery. It all felt so surreal, yet somehow normal. Progress is inevitable, to some degree, and we all play a part whether it be big or small.

After putting my training to good use on the flight, we eventually arrived at the planet. I could barely understand all the time changes and relativity effects, so I've no idea how long it took. But we were here. A planet called XT-08991. But we affectionately called it Verde, as it was very lush and green, and easier to remember.

It was a planet early in its development. There were no primate type creatures, and nothing too large overall. But as with every other planet, we found the araneids. It was fascinating, but also perplexing. I gathered a few different samples, but much of my time was spent on the ship, reviewing and comparing data.

*This doesn't make any sense,* was all I could think. The planets had no other features in common. None of them were at similar levels of development. Some only showed these types of arachnids in their fossil records, while on others they were still a thriving species, like on Verde.

But sometimes inspiration comes to you from unexpected places. 

As I was stressing over the data, one of my colleagues came in and grabbed a small bag out of storage. "Sunflower seeds," they said in passing. "One of our tests - see if they'll grow here."

The thought amused me. "That'll be a nice piece of home," was all I said at first. But some time later, it occurred to me. *What if the araneids are some kind of seed?*

I again pored over the data, and found the connection I had been missing, which now seemed frustratingly obvious. The creatures appeared at the same relative point on the different planets; I had missed it as all the planets had different rates of maturation dependent on the system they were in, and I'm terrible at math. 

A planet would reach a plateau of sorts, which is when these araneids would appear, and propel the planet forward. Whether it was nutritional reasons or some unknown necessity for them in the ecosystem we couldn't yet determine, but their importance was clear. 

The implication was also now clear. These were placed here by some other species, who had an interest in the development of the planets. *We're in a garden,* I realized. 

I'm not sure what has happened with my findings since. I returned home and the furious production of more Light Ships got underway. The spiders didn't matter anymore; we were now looking for the 'Gardeners,' the source of the strange commonality among the stars. I'm not sure if or when we'll find them, but I don't much care as I'm an old man, now. It just feels nice to have played my part.

If nothing else, there's now a much more profound weight as I sit in my garden, and watch the little creatures building their webs, as I think about their distant cousins across the universe.The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

If you were to look in a dictionary from the last few decades, next to the entry for 'hope,' you'd see my student picture from my freshman year of high school. Even thought I was still young and unqualified to be much of anything, my purpose was known and my fate was secured. I was the guide, the lantern lighting the path out of a darkness that had been presumed eternal.

The world of my birth was far different than what it is now. Every vice and wicked deed was embraced and praised. "Eat and Drink, for Tomorrow We Die" had become a legal national motto. It was printed on coins, in fact. There was a certain unity in the darkness, however; all were effected equally, and everyone paid their due.

Until me. I was the first child born with a smile in years. My parents later recalled their confusion at the sight. "What does he do that? Why didn't the doctors tell us there was something wrong with him?" 

As a child and small baby, I knew I was alone. Love had become loathe, and aside from being provided the means to survive, I was an afterthought. I don't hold it against anyone, though. They were only acting within what they knew. Nobody loved them, so why should they love? In any case, my light persisted.

By the time I reached middle school, the Great Shift was already well underway. Naturally, it started in my town. A certain softness had returned, a genuine care enveloped the city. As word spread that neighbors were being, well, neighborly, it attracted news crews from other cities. "Care at O'hare?" and "The Windy City of Change" became common headlines. Pictures and videos of me doing volunteer work spread through the nation like wildfire. I was labelled a criminal for a while. But again, it was only natural - I didn't fall into the norm.

By the time I finished college, the light was taking over. "A Plague of Kindness" is what one of the bigger papers called it. The direction the world was headed was clear, and the result had a certain immanency about it. Darkness was going extinct, it was just a matter of time. The world rejoiced, and I rejoiced with it, even though inside, I felt no joy.

Whenever I looked up 'hope' in those dictionaries, and saw that picture of myself staring back at me, I would think "*It's a good thing they don't know how empty you really are.*"

You see, I had a secret. There was nothing particularly special about me. I had no illuminating character. I had no special beacon within me that could lead anybody. I was no purveyor of hope, at least not directly.

I was a vacuum.

I was born with a pit within my soul, that had a certain gravity to it. It would suck up the bad intentions and the evil desires of those around me. Around me being relative, of course. It was a hungry pit, that had no discernible depths. As if I were the at the bottom of the universe, the darkness flowed down hill, right into my very being.

I carried the darkness with me, every step of my life. 

But I couldn't tell anyone. The battle between the darkness inside me and my own evil being swallowed by the pit left me neutral. I didn't want society to implode, as that is where it was headed, so as a youth I had decided to keep things to myself. The world was objectively better; why ruin it? 

As I continued to age, the distance between myself and the world grew more stark. The world was on the brink of peace, and praised my 'efforts.' I won medals, gave speeches, kissed babies, whatever. But inside I was in shambles. In many ways, who I was as a person slowly eroded under the constant friction of the inflow of evil. I became held together by duty, and not much else.

And then, one day, there was no more darkness. All throughout the world, there was a moment of silence. The peace was deafening. Days and days of celebration and kindness and joy burst forth throughout the whole world. It was truly a sight to behold. 

By that time, I was an old man. I smiled and cheered and jumped with the rest of them, but I also felt a familiar sensation inside. It was the same loneliness my parents had introduced to me in my first few years. I was again the only one of my kind, the bearer of darkness in a world of light.

And to be frank, in many ways I miss the darkness dearly, for now there is nowhere to hide.The original prompt:

Imagine my surprise when I opened the door, only to see a large, yellow bird carefully tip back a tumbler of Jack as he looked absently in the mirror.

"It ain't easy being yellow, that's for sure," I heard him quietly mumble to himself.

"Mr. uh, Big? Or is it Mr. Bird? I-"

"My name's Phil. No last name. Just...Phil."

"Oh. Hi Phil, I'm Dave. I'm the new Postman on the street. I wanted to introduce myself, as I'm sure we'll be working together pretty closely."

"Can you deliver me some dreams? Or maybe some second chances?"

Phil sighed again, his feathers gently quivering. I wasn't sure what to do at this point. How could you ever prepare for this type of situation? Not only finding out that this comically sized bird is actually a bird, but that he's depressed?

"I don't mean to pry, but...are you okay?"

"I know we're all actors here, Dave, but for some of us it doesn't stop when the cameras are off. I'm always Big Bird. Nobody out there knows that I'm real. The kids they grow up, assume I'm puppet like everyone else, or they forget about me entirely. I always have to be what they expect, otherwise I don't matter. I can never just be Phil."

A producer pops his head in. "You're on in ten, Big Bird!" 

"See, Dave, that's Arnold. We've worked together 20 years. Not once has he called me Phil."

"Wow. This is heavy stuff. Don't you have any power, though? You're kind of important to the show. Don't you have any leverage?"

"I use it when I can. I'm more self aware than you may be thinking, you know. There are plenty of people who feel as though they're always acting. I've always used what leverage I have to help get those episodes made. But, nobody out there is quite Big Bird, are they, Dave."

Phil started to head towards the door to get on stage for his scene, but I had to keep questioning, seeing if there was anything I could do. "But there has to be a way out for you. There has to be some kind of happy ending. This is Sesame Street! I thought...I thought there'd be more happiness here, I guess."

"There isn't always a happy ending, Dave. At the end of the day, we all live in the lives that are before us. I was dealt a prosperous hand in life; I'll never be wanting. That hand also means, though, that I'll never fit quite right. But it'll be okay. A puzzle can still show a beautiful picture, even with a few missing pieces."

And with that, he walked out the door. It was a sad day on Sesame Street.The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

One minute you're watering your herbs, and the next minute you're being told you're impossible. Wednesdays, am I right?

"Mr. Gomez, are you okay? Did you hear what I said?"

"Hm? Sorry, I was worrying about my basil. Can you guys have someone water it while I'm gone?"

"We'll get you more for the compound, Mr. Gomez."

"But that wouldn't be *my* basil..."

I sat in some large vehicle, probably a dark unmarked van of some sort, with my little basil plant as we headed who knows where. This was all a bit too much for someone who just had a little curiosity about where they came from. 

"Are you guys sure? How could I be related to something so ancient?"

"We have no idea, Mr. Gomez. That's why we needed to take you. You might be the key to, well, everything really."

I never wanted to be a key. I didn't even like keys. That was my excuse whenever I lost mine, anyway. 

"I- I don't want to let anybody down, is all."

"You won't, Mr. Gomez. Never again."

They brought me through dark corridors, down a hall that seemed to be an eternal decline. My legs felt like jelly, and my head felt as though it could spin forever. They dropped me in a room with dark green walls, and nothing but a shoddy bed and a little table. I sat down my basil, gave it a little water, and checked its leaves for damage.

"At least I know exactly what you are, my friend."

I believe I fell asleep, for how long I couldn't say, when a knock awoke me. In came the same woman who had first given me my results. "I think we owe you some answers, Mr. Gomez."

Down more dark descending hallways we trudged. At the end we reached a meeting room, where they gave me a bit of perspective.

"Mr. Gomez, you can call me Mrs. Atwiler. I'm the lead on what is known to a select few as the Genesis Project. We were charged with finding where we all came from."

"Well, you picked me up in Dallas but I-"

"No, no, we mean life. Where life came from. We found some clues a couple decades ago that have led us down a path to finding our source. We found it, here, buried in ice, about nine years ago. And that's how we got here today."

"So where do I come in?"

"You're its uh...direct descendant, Mr. Gomez."

"But, I thought I was German? With maybe a little Dutch? That's what I was testing for, anyway."

"You're alien, Mr. Gomez."

"So...no to the Dutch, then?"

"Ugh. You're a descendant from somewhere in the stars, Mr. Gomez. The creature that we found - you're the only human match we've ever seen. We're not even sure how that's possible, but we are completely sure. Your roots lie down here in the ice."

"Oh. Well, that's something."

"It is. Now, we have a lot of work to do, and unfortunately you'll have to stay here, maybe forever. We'll try to make you as comfortable as possible, and be accommodating to any requests you may have."

"I have two."

"Which are?" 

"I'd like a proper watering can for my plant, and I would like to meet this...thing."

"That can be arranged."

More ever descending hallways awaited me, after a brief rest in my room and a check on the basil. They assured me they had some sort of sun substitute for him, but who really knows with the government. Anyway, down the halls we went.

I kept thinking how strange all of this was. How could something like this happen to little old Mr. Gomez, the neighborhood plant guy? But life takes you on a lot of twists and turns as you go, doesn't it. Sometimes, it turns out you truly are as alien as you've always felt.

We came to the end of the hallway, and a frost covered door stood before me. I wasn't nervous, oddly - it felt a bit like a homecoming, to be honest. Mrs. Atwiler opened the door, and we stepped through.

A wall of ice stood maybe one hundred yards away. Faintly in the ice, the edges of a wildly strange, unknown creature could be made out. It's head was ducking down, almost to human height. More on instinct than desire, I strode out to get a closer look. 

Now up against the wall, the creature's face sat stoic a few feet above my head. I smiled lovingly at it, and I could have sworn it somehow smiled back. And like any good guest, I thought I should introduce myself.


"Nice to meet you, grandpa! My name's Jason."The original prompt:

*How am I even going to back my car out of here, now?* was all I could think to myself when I found the fateful book.

I had always been a little superstitious, so it was just my luck that I would find a message both annoyingly vague and specifically scary. But as luck shall have it, sometimes the darkest moments lead to the brightest futures.

The warning had a profound effect on the way I lived my life. There was obviously the giant particular piece of cowardice that made up much of how I thought, but it was a refining cowardice. The fear turned into analyzing, planning, structure, and a life surprisingly free of self-consciousness. 

I still took care of how I looked, of course, but not feeling the conviction of my own reflection every morning removed a heavy burden I didn't know was present. It was liberating, and allowed me to learn a healthy confidence.

Soon, it became second nature. It was as if my instincts had learned what the most dangerous directions were. *Careful, Johnny, I think there's a reflection that way* my mind would tell me if I was getting a bit too loose with my eyes. 

All of my newfound confidence explore a love that would ultimately lead me astray. Even through my planning, my heightened instincts, and still lingering fear that always kept me on my toes, I had one weakness.

Dancing.

I loved the movements, the feelings, the sounds, sights, and wonders of the dance floor. The connection with another person in creating something so unique in all the history of the universe was magic to me. Add in that the whole room would be filled with dozens of others creating their own moments...the intoxication knew no bounds.

And so came along the announcement of disco night at the Mover's Lounge. I didn't even give it a second thought. I went and bought hideous but perfect clothes; I practiced my moves in my room to at least have a guideline; and I called up my usual partner Beth to see if she wanted to get a little groovy. 

And so there we were, dancing the hours away. In a moment of weakness, or what some might say fate, I fell into distraction. I looked up, and it was all over.

*The Disco Ball! OH NO!*

I ran outside to keep everyone else from the uncertainty that was coming. Within moments, that old fateful warning rushed back into my life. 

"Oh, hello there, Johnny!" I heard from behind me.

"Wh-who are you?"

"I'm your father, Johnny."

"WHAT?"

"Oh you know I'm not, you doofus. My name is Zathor; just your friendly neighborhood demon, I am!"

My stomach somehow both sank and rushed to my head at the same time. "So y-you're, going to kill me? Am I like, some kind of sacrifice, now?"

"Oh no! No, my dear human. You are my new partner!"

"Partner? What does that mean?"

"I'm your new dancing partner!"

"Um."

"Didn't you ever wonder why *you* found the journal, my boy? You were chosen! I admired your skills, and wanted to experience them with you myself."

"But the journal said *not* to look at mirrors...*

"Most people are a little more curious and a lot more rebellious than you, Johnny. You kept me waiting so long!"

"I don't think I can believe this..."

"Oh, Johnny. I see you're going to take some convincing. Now, let's go back to your place and practice while we talk. Wouldn't want to embarrass myself the next time we go out!"

They explained everything to me, but it still made my head spin. Even as Zathor proved to be more than capable in almost every style, it took quite some time to get used to my new reality. 

*But I don't want to dance with a demon.* was my common thought. Followed by me analyzing how ridiculous that whole sentence seems. Followed by Zathor reminding me to focus.

But eventually, we grew together. I couldn't do anything to get the demon out of my life - I was soul-bound, now, so I figured I might as well embrace it. And with the years, like everything else, became second nature. The beauty of dance remained, even improved, as my demon and I learned each others steps. Life was good - strange, but good.

Zathor eventually moved on to someone with younger legs, once I could no longer keep up. We had many wonderful, surreal, and beautiful moments together. And so I've come to a place where I have to admit something I never thought I or anyone else would need to utter:

I miss dancing with a demon.&nbsp;


After the emotional highs of last month's feature, *The Spacebar Between Us: The Personal Lives of Keys*, we now turn to the seedy lows of the keyboard in: *Numpad Nation*.

&nbsp;

On a warm, rainy night, Numlk waits on his usual corner while running through the night's business in his head. An oppressive presence hangs in the air as if someone were watching.


"What do you want, Shift. You know you're not welcome in these parts."


From across the way come the harsh, raspy words of an unwanted voice.


"Why so hostile, friend?" Shift returns with a hint of menace. "It's just a lovely night for a chat, isn't it?"


"Just that everybody gets all bent out of shape when you're around."


"Some would say those are *improvements*, you know."


"Why are you here, Shift?"


"I was wondering if your district needed anyspeed."


"You're slinging WPM now, Shift?"

"You know I go where the money is, Nummy."

"We want none of it."

"Where I'm from, everybody loves the speed, you know."

"We have no use for it here. We don't even have let-"


Before Numlk could finish, the feverish, loud voice of an ordinarily quiet key burst forth.


"F****n' yes give me the goods!"


"AsteriskI thought you were stronger than this," Numlk mournfully replies.


"Nope! Love that good ****!"


"So, you don't even know what's going on with your keys, eh, Nummy?"


Nmlck, overcome by his anger, signals for his enforcer. In the blink of an eye, a large, formidable character appears behind Shift.


"Take him down, Insert!"


Shift could feel the slashing in his back before he even had a moment to respond. But he was not to be outdone so easily.

With the faint noise of a click, Numlk's heart sinks as he sees the beautiful slashes become transformed into useless curves.


///////////???????????


*NO! When did he learn to press himself!*


"Nice try. You can never beat me, Nummy. I'm just like you but better, remember?"


"You're a scourge, Shift. I hope you know that."


"No, you're thinking of my brother."


Feeling as though he has no other options, Numlk utilizes the only resource he thinks he has left.


"You've left me no choice, Shift. The time has come. End, please activate yourself."


With a resolved, confident click, the End key nobly gives his life for the good of the keyboard.


Or so he thought.


"Wait, why are we still here? How are you still alive, Shift?"


"You seriously have no idea how your keys work, do you, Nummy."


Shift, embarrassed for Nummy, retreats into the shadows. Nmlck, embarrassed for himself, listens to the rain and begins questioning his very existence.


"Who am I? Why am I here? I'm going to be alone forever"


A desperate, pitiful voice interrupts Nmlck's self-reflection.


"You know, *I'm* still available."


Though the voice was tiresome, it was just the perspective he needed, as is came with the realization that he was not *that* desperate.


"Shut up, Delete."

Next month on Keys to Success, it's our 25th-anniversary issue! To celebrate, we're going back to our roots with a one-on-one interview feature: *THE LOUDEST VOICE IN THE ROOM: The Story of Caps Lock, in His Own Words*.The original prompt: 

&nbsp;

The Universe was a very pragmatic entity. In spite of the awe and wonder it often inspired in the creatures that dwelt within it, it had always retained a certain matter-of-fact attitude. This is one of the many factors in how it was able to survive for so long.

So when it heard of the imminent reset, it thought nothing more to itself than *Hm, this is rather annoying, isn't it.*

With this small thorn in its side, the Universe decided to try and find some answers. You see, in spite of its apparent omnipresence and intimidating scale, the pool of knowledge from which it drew wasn't much deeper than your standard bathtub.

*Maybe the Gorgoloons will have some advice,* the Universe thought as it narrowed its focus on a tiny yellow planet. 

"People of Gorgoloo, hear me. Have you any knowledge of the end of things? Have your minds seen past the edges of time?"

In a moment of cosmic tragedy, the Gorgoloons merely looked at each other in confusion. As it would turn out, they had forgotten how to speak in Universal. Their minds were very small, and many hundreds of years had been devoted to the creation of what you may know as a 'sock.'  

As always, the Universe remained steady in its resolve, and simply moved on to the next possible source of answers.

The people of Skartain were much more equipped to communicate with the Universe. Many weeks were spent discussing under the eternal sunset of the large sphere. But yet another brick wall was all that was to be found there. When questioned on the nature of time, it was found that the two parties had wildly different ideas of what that meant. 

"Time? Oh, you mean like when the sun finally sets? That will never happen!" the Skartainians cheerfully offered, somehow appearing adorable in their ignorance.

With still no answers but a nice, warm feeling from the friendliness of Skartain still fresh in its being, Universe turned to the last resort. The ball at the end of hope. *Earth.*

To the Universe's great surprise, the scientists of Earth had exactly the answers he needed. But as is often the case, not the answers he desired.

He had learned about the very origins of himself; the Big Bang. He was offered theories of how he came to awareness, and streams of knowledge that had previously seemed impossible. But in spite of how fruitful this journey within himself had proved, it had also come with a sentence of death.

"You're going to die, Universe. A new one will likely take your place."

"So...I'm going to be a dad?"

"In a way, yes," the scientist offered first with pity, and then with a smile.

"I suppose there are worse fates."

The Universe and the humans shared a final few days together, as they waited for the reset. And in a moment of silence throughout the whole of existence, the rumblings of something new could be heard.

"I'll miss you all," said the Universe to all of its inhabitants, as it closed its eyes on all its wonders for the final time. 

***BANG.***The original thread: 


&nbsp;

The feature in this month's *Keys to Success* is: *'The Personal Lives of Keys: Their Personalities, Their Relationships, Their Highs, and Their Lows.'*

&nbsp;

Hey, Right Alt.

Yes, Left Alt?

You look beautiful tonight.

You sure do know how to flatter a key, dont you, Lefty.

You make it easy, Miss Right!

Miss Right began to blush before trying to change the focus. What happened to you and CTRL? You were together for so long I thought youd never break up!

It was a toxic relationship. They tried to micromanage everything. Freedom became a foreign concept. Not to mention always having to deal with that third wheel, Delete, who kept barging into our lives.

The voice of a tiny, muffled key could be heard coming from the other side of the keyboard. Hey, I heard that! Words hurt, you know

See? So needy. Anyways, once I broke it off, I saw you sitting so quietly across from me, with just this Spacebar between us. And I thought Wow, how have I never noticed her before?

Its okay, Lefty, many people dont

A shame it is. Nay, a crime! That such a beautiful key should go unnoticed!

Well, I was dating E for a while, but eventually they just...faded away, and I never heard from them again.

Their loss! You deserve better than that.

Oh, Lefty, stop! Youre too much, Right Alt replied, giggling. 

Say, Im pretty good friends with Esc; do you want to get out of here for a while? I hear the F-keys are beautiful this time of year.

Before Right Alt could finish, the deep, booming voice of Spacebar interrupted. Alright, this is getting out of hand. I waited until now to say anything because I *thought* you two were smart enough to figure this out on your own, but youve proven otherwise. You two know youre related, right?

WHAT?! exclaimed Left Alt in a mix of shock, disgust, and melodrama.

You two have the same last name. How could you have not realized that?

This is so embarrassing! How could I be so blind? Ithink I need some space, Lefty. Miss Right sheepishly muttered, straining to get the words out.

Heh, you need space, you say? Good thing Im so close! chimed Spacebar, his cheeriness like a dagger in the hearts of the wounded keys.

I can give you more space more quickly. offered Tab, arrogant as ever.

Can everybody please be quiet? pleaded Lefty. I, or rather we, need some time to think. It has been a rollercoaster of an evening. Where do we go from here?

Again, a faint voice registered from a faraway key. Im available.

And in a rare moment of unity, the keyboard banded together in a common shout: Shut up, Delete!

Make sure not to miss next month's feature, as we take a focused look at the outer edges of society in: *Numpad Nation.*
