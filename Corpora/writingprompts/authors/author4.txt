&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon nameless hills sat a quiet village, patched stonework made up its roads and thatched cottages made up its homes.Within this place, so far and forgotten from the world, sat a boy upon the rusted husk of what once qualified as a bed.Now it trembled at every touch, mimicking its occupant, whose teeth rattled against bitter whispers of the wind.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No wandering about, youre to stay in bed and sleep.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, maam, replied the boy, looking up from rough spun blanket held tight around his shoulders.His voice cracked in a manner much older than the seven years he held, letting loose a dry heave he was forced to swallow away.A woman stood in the room, a crone really, one he knew not to cross.She was a tall wisp of a person, but the true terror of her was illuminated by the candle gleaming in her hand.The crook of the saucer deferred enough weight for her brittle wrists to keep it level, but it still angled toward to rotting floors.Her face, her skin, and her bones; All shallow and cold.The others once compared her to a skeleton, but it was Flora who said in the lowest light the old woman resembled every lich spoken of in old mens stories.Flora, the recollection of her name left him devastated.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thats a good lad, god is watching.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No he isnt, whispered the boy, his heart fluttering as the woman furrowed her brow.A moments consideration passed between them before she turned away and disappeared through the narrow arch, slamming the door shut behind her.If he was watching, shed still be here.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her feet dragged across the steps as she made her way to the cottages ground floor.The boy sighed to himself as the last echoes of light died, leaving him alone.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What ails you, Soot? The voice was high and happy, with a slight hiss as it drifted away.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flora is gone, Soot replied to the shadows.A man and a woman came today, they took her. He nodded toward the empty bed opposite him and frowned, his voice remained a whisper lest he wake the caretaker below.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A family?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, he answered.A family. The word lingered upon his tongue, like the stench of the half rotted apples that comprised his lunch.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Family.Hed had two now, both lost to him.Two summers past, during the youngest moon of a month he couldnt remember, a band of brigands happened upon his home.Soot remembered nothing of the night, only the slight sliver of the moon as he woke.They burned everything, every evidence that Soot ever had a home and left the boy buried beneath the ruins.It was there, amidst the smoldering wreckage, that he was found, buried deep beneath the rafters and roofing of his ravaged home.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some merciful soul must have discovered Soot, but when he woke once more he was in this new village.They wrapped him in anointed bandages, hiding the burns that covered his body, and muttered passages of scripture over him, fully expecting the boy to die.He didnt.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first night of his rehabilitation was the harshest, he tried screaming through the night but found himself unable.His throat was raw, dry, and soundless.It was here that his friend first appeared, winding within the shadows around his bed and spoke to him.They shared stories, woes, and a great many laughs as Soot struggled to find strength once more.The shadow was the first friend of his new life.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Soot ran his fingers over the strange web of skin that now comprised his face, a weave of intersecting, unmatched patches that grew during his recovery.It was Flora who first named him Soot, when the boy refused to speak.She was younger than him, perhaps by a year, and often was the only one willing to speak with the strange boy in bandages that now occupied a corner of the orphanage.The towns physician took to visiting the children, but where Soot was concerned he applied careful focus.An ashen paste was used to calm the boys burns, it left him a shadow as well.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will you leave me too? Soot asked the night.Youre my last friend now, and you were my first.Will you leave me too?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Someday, yes.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I dont want you to leave, Soot sighed.Youre the only one who never afraid of me, who never called me a monster.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I never felt the need, cooed the shadow.Were both monsters, Soot.We need someone to talk to.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will you stay then?Will you stay with me, even during the day?I dont want to be alone again.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot.I will continue to visit, I will continue to see you, but only in darkness.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are you afraid of the light?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arent you?

***

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Days withered and months followed, and his friend never failed to appear.The shadows spoke to Soot, they spoke every night and regaled him with tales written in smoke across a black canvas.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Soot, this is the last time well see each other for a while.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Youre stronger now, youre better.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No Im not!Im still alone, Im alone during the day.Its me and the old lady, she doesnt like me.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She is your family.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Im her charge, not her family.My family is dead.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So am I. Youve spent enough time with ghosts, Soot.Its time you went into the world, time you made your way.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nobody wants me.Even youre leaving me, why?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Soot

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why?Why wont you stay with me? Soot shouted.He leapt from his bed and stood among the shadows, ignoring the shuffle of feet up the stairs.I dont want to be alone, dont leave!

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Behind him, the door burst open and the old woman stood in the doorway with her candle held aloft.Soot stared at her a moment, her own eyes revealed by the wicks light.Remembering his friends fears, Soot hurried across the room and swatted the candle from her grasp.His caretakers hand gave way as her eyes grew wider, the candle crashed into the ground and rolled through a crack in the floor.Soot turned away from her back toward the shadows, expecting some hint of his friend.He found none.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Below them, the candle had swallowed the lodgings lower level.Glints of orange flame tickled their way through the gapped floorboards, singing the bottoms Soots trousers.He reeled desperately, looking for any indication of his friend as the old woman shouted incoherently for him to follow her.Soot ignored her and sat on his bed once more, watching as the old woman finally turned and left him as the first of the roofs beams caught fire.The cottage collapsed around him, but he hugged his knees tight and remained in the bed.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I cant be alone again, he whispered.As the flames engulfed the walls around Soot, he stared at the shadow growing opposite him upon the bed that once belonged to Flora.He let out a cry of relief, smiling a smile that cracked the dry scales of his face.There you are

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why have you forsaken me? I muttered to myself as I stepped onto the balcony and studied my home, my kingdom.Was I not a worthy successor?Have I not brought us a flock worthy to rival any before it?  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The great silence answered me, not with words or signs, but with more of the same.Years spent wandering in their sick, infested world seeking to bring light left me tired.It left me so tired and I hid.Why has the light forsaken me?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I felt a chill in my arm as my knees hit the cedar, a soft crunch of my bones settling as I hung my head.Absently, my fingers intertwined as I swung my hands together.I brought the upper of my thumbs, the sole digit not nestled in this hallowed embrace, to rest between my brows.On my knees, humbled and at prayer, I called a god long neglected.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In their minds, I took your place, I whispered.I took your throne as my own, used it to build this place.But are they not better here?Did I not free them from the distractions of self-imposed daily necessities?I am their savior, as you were mine.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No answer came, and no answer would.I couldnt help pleading further, I beg of you, help me.This place, this place is the answer.I know it is, you have to let me finish what I started.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I heard the rattle of gunfire near my home, theyd breached the walls and likely paraded through my streets.Agents of submission, armed by their masters to silence meto cull my herd.I only wanted to help you, I managed through grit teeth as footsteps thundered up my steps.A volley of shouts, entirely incoherent, surrounded me as white lights bathed me.They traced me over, weapons at the ready and continued shouting.I managed a lone chuckle and admitted, I saved them, but that wasnt enoughI needed to be you.

_________________________________________________

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perched precariously atop the ragged cliffs of Erosmere rested a castle known the world over as the Black Clove, but to Senka it was home.She sat atop the abandoned plinth that held gilded steel railing, binding the black marble balcony in a vine of garnet encrusted leaves.Opposite her, on the left to the two front plinths, sat a rough carved gargoyle, snarling at the winds with its one broken wing.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Year before, they had been a pair, and Senka remembered it vividly.Her skin still prickled at the thought of watching the gargoyle, whose perch she now occupied, tumbling across the jagged edges that protruded from Erosmere.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A tug at her tunic drew her back from memory, and turned her head.Before her stood a knight, wrapped in armor bearing the same gilded vines and broken wings that emblazoned her fathers standard.Beneath his guard were fine, patterned silks whose cerulean sheen was dulled by the specks of blood and grime that spread upon them.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your father has told you on numerous accounts not to sit there, Princess, he said.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Theres blood in your beard, Sir Warin, replied Senka.Why are you here?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As she turned away, the knight ran a finger through the braided, grey knots that framed his otherwise sunken face and frowned.Senka had known Warin all her life, he had served as her protector for all of her ten years.She felt his worry on her back, though his hand once more held her tunic in place as she watched the valley below.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the widowed fields of Terratraus, fires burned among men and horses dotting every direction.The plain she had once galloped through with her mother was now a smoldering crater, hewn by the dreads of cants and cries.The latest of these white fire sermons seared through a column of cavalry that hoped to enter the fray.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We must go, Princess, said Sir Warin.The King insists 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I asked you to stay with him, replied Senka.Why are you here?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think you know precisely why Im here, said Sir Warin.Your father sent me to take you away, before they take this castle.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Senka said nothing, she instead watched the story unfolding below.A flood of new invaders arrived from beyond the mouth of the valley, marching in a slow and deliberate manner toward the heart of the fight.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why are they doing this? she asked, her tone more defeated that she intended.Why wont they leave us alone?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why indeed, mused Sir Warin.His nails dragged a little as his clutch on her tunic tightened.Why did they harass our borders?Why did they strike down our emissaries?Why did they burn your

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He trailed off on the last, but Senka finished the thought, Why did they burn mother alive?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After a silence, broken by the howling below, she asked, They dont like us, do they? 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, they dont.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But why?Because we ignore their gods?Because we live in the same way we have since my ancestors occupied this castle?They burned her alive because she brandished they precious spell-craft, because she taught it to anyone willing to learn.They call us villains, they think were evil because we choose to live our way

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I see youve been listening to you tutors.Your father warned her against that, but she insisted on traveling through their lands.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So?She only wanted to help them, she only wanted tothey killed her without reason.They killed her

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They killed her and goaded your father into a war hell never win, said Sir Warin.He picked her up off the plinth and set her down on the balcony, she was always staggered when facing the brute of a man on equal ground.She was small for her age and barely managed to match the mans waist.Hes down there, fighting them, but he cant win.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She felt a surge of protest, but was cut short as he continued, No, he cant.If he could win, I wouldnt have been sent here.Now listen, he kneeled and met her gaze.I know there must be some hundred worries floating through that little head of yours, Princess, but right now we need to focus on one thing, and one thing onlywe need to run.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We need to fight, she replied.Senka balled up both her fists and slammed them down the knights shoulders, her left came away bleeding as it scraped across a gilded vine.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Someday, we may, said Sir Warin.He took a dagger from his belt and cut away a length of silk from the cuff of his left hand.Warin carefully bandaged her bleeding hand and rested his grimy left paw upon her branch-like shoulder, But for now, we run.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was a typical day, the sort that blends into the week and fades from memory.I strolled down the cracking pavement that led to my classroom, past faceless people craning their heads into little worlds nestled in their palms.You would assume nothing of note would happen this day, but then came the light.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her smile was sudden, the only face I could, or wanted, to remember.A swelling of my heart forced a smile to match, but she turned away.I swear her eyes met mine, fixed on me as turned into a classroom, my classroom.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Go sit by her,* said the first thought, I named it Rash.I never trusted this one, not since it convinced me snitch to Casey Ray back in grade five.That particular decision led to half a dozen years of torment, and wasnt one I was eager to repeat.Then again, it was making sense today.*Trust me, go sit by her.*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Youre making sense, she did smile at me, I said.One of the faceless cranes look up at me, wearing a newly puzzled mask- brows narrowed and low.What?Never heard a guy talk to himself? They became faceless once more, but I regretted snapping at them.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *That wasnt your best moment, but ignore the advice to stalk the poor girl,* piped up a second, proclaimed as Fearful.*She smiled at you, dont make more of it than it is.*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Trust me, this is our chance,* retorted Rash.*Listen to that fool again and we will be alone.*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Again?Like the years weve spent on the outside because you refuse to think things through?* cackled Fearful.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You two need to come to a consensus, or Im going with my gut, I said.Easing my way through the door, I entered the room.My issue was seated toward the upper middle rows of the auditorium style room, she gave another glance as I walked down the steps.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Now we have to,* said Rash.*Did you see what I saw?*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *I saw a girl spare passing glance,* replied Fearful.*Get yourself under control.*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I stood on the steps as people moved past me, frozen between her aisle and the one behind.Someone needed to make a decision, and someone needed to make it soon.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *All of you need to shut up,* shouted a new, familiar voice.Reason: old, reliable, and often ignored.*Sit in the row behind her and leave a gap, I could have solved this in five seconds.Fucking amateurs.*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Unless she has no interest and we get too close for comfort,* squealed Fearful.*We need to sit in front of her, two or three rows down.* 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Sit next to her or spend another year alone,* growled Rash.*This is so fucking simple.*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *I want both of you to shut up,* snapped Reason.*Ive always had the right answers and hes ignored me because of you two!*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Right answers?Youre the worst, at least we know when were wrong,* said Rash.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will everyone just shut the fuck up?! I shouted.All eyes in the room turned toward me, confused and somewhat alarmed.I bit my lip and knew from the burning at the ends of my ears I was a shade of scarlet to rival Catholic Cardinals.With one last glance at the smiling girl, I lowered my head and hurried up the stairs.To complicate matters, I stumbled twice in my haste and bit the wall of my cheek as my thoughts bickered.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *See what youve done now?* snorted Reason.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I stumbled again, but opted to stay down.My head came to rest on the steps and I let out a sigh, You all really fucked this up.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are you alright? asked a voice, sweet and cool.I raised my head and saw the object of my affection, or rather my affliction, walk past and come to a rest a step above.My eyes traced over her smile and rested on her own bright hazels, curved in amusement.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; UhII, yeah.Yep, Im good, I said.As I began to prop myself up, she offered a hand to steady myself.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *See?I was right,* teased Rash.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Just fuck off, please,* said Reason.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Shes going to break our hearts,* sighed Fearful.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hey, hows it going? I asked, not expecting an answer.The old fellow in the booth frowned at me and held out a hand.What, no small talk?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pried loose an aging Lincoln from my wallet, equally aged and absent its original scent.The sun bleached it, left it smooth in my hand.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The old fellow made a grasping motion, leading me to assume he was growing impatient.I crumpled the note slightly, unable to hold back my frustration as I shoved it into his writhing appendages.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I turned away from the old bastard, awaiting the fall of the three pillars before me.It never came.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I turned back toward the attendant, his hand now caressing the Lincoln note.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are you going to open the gate?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will when you give some money, replied the old bastard.His voice had the nasal quality of a man who spent too many years sneering.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What the fuck do you think is in your hand?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tissue, he said.You cant fool me, young lady.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ima man, I replied, summoning whatever gravitas I could muster.It fell short.

**born of a collaberation with /u/you-are-lovely**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Ye who enters here take heed, death awaits you in these woods,* the girl read, looking at a tattered old sign tacked to a tree.Below it a second note read, *It will find you, you cant hide.Beware all those who go inside.*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This was painted half-hazard on the bark just beneath the first.A dozen other signs littered the area.They all said varying things along the same lines.Death had fallen on these woods, and death still slumbered there waiting for its next victim.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fiera sighed as she took a step past the sign.No one should enter, but she had to.She had to know._____________________________________________________________________________________

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The forest curled upon itself the deeper she went, dimming the day into forced night.The canopies shroud only furthered her discomfort, and tightened her two fingered grip on the simple hatchet strapped to her belt.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She considered, briefly, straying from the worn path and into the tall grasses.The tree-line was almost welcoming, despite the pitch black beyond it.Something about the dirt road left her equally weary and wary, as if she was walking toward somethingfamiliar.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her unease was disrupted by the hint of a glow near the roots of a tree to her left.Fiera neared the parcel of light, coming to a crouch and sifting through brush.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please, dont hurt me, came a cry.It was soft, but squeaky at the same time.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Im not here to hurt you, replied Fiera.Her hands parted the last of the brush, revealing the strange source of the squeals.Among the greenery and mud lay a man, no larger than Fieras own fist.He was wholly naked and absent anydefining characteristics, smoothed over where genitalia would be.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On his back were two broken wings, their fragile veneer reflected against the strange light emanating from his core.He glowed, there was little other way to describe it.There seemed to be no source, it radiated only from his skin.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fiera scooped the sprite, who struggled slightly, into her palm.She rose to her feet and studied the little creature in the palm of her hand, he resembled the fairies and pixies often described in her grandfathers fables.The pixie gave two soft pats against her palm as he found his footing and began to dust himself off.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fiera frowned at the figurine, furrowed he brows, and asked, What happened to your wings?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why are you in these woods?Dont your kind know better? he asked, pointing to the signs that adorned the path.Every successive tree trunk bore messages akin to the first, but Fiera ignored after the first dozen.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ill answer your question when you answer mine, replied Fiera.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The tiny face frowned at her, but said, I was attacked by a crow.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Does that happen often?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is your turn to answer, said the pixie.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, you asked your question in two parts.I chose to delay the second half my question, said Fiera.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I dont like you, frowned the sprite.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Youre not the first to express that, please answer.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is not uncommon, he said.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I see, she said.She raised the pixie to her shoulder, allowing him to climb off and settle in.Im here for answers, and my kind often ignore danger when curiosity strikes us.
___________________________________________________________________________________

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fiera and her new companion walked for some time, allowing long silences between them.She came to know him as Vidrick, a fairy of this forest- a child of the elder wood.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Odd name for a fairy, she said.Stories give your kind softer names, simpler names. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Human stories, he scoffed.Same stories that led you here, after some imagined witch.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Theyre not stories, she insisted.This place, these woods, have plagued us for decades.Ive seen the specter walking along its edge, Ive seen the innards in my dreams

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You think you have some connection to this place, he snorted.You humans and your delusions never cease to amuse.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I thought you sprites were meant to be morejovial, frowned Fiera.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, youve found one answer, laughed Vidrick.He gave a slight cough and steadied himself by tugging her collar, apparently winded by his joy.I would ready that axe of yours.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why? she asked, but was quickly answered when howls echoed from the night and the brush rustled.Fiera brandished her hatchet and steadied her stance, briefly distracted by the dull reflection of Vidricks glow.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the left, said Vidrick.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She swung down hard and leapt to the right, feeling her weapons grip rattle in her hands.A yelp let her know she hit meat, and the sudden iron in the air set her teeth on edge.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As she found ground once more, her right ankle rolled beneath her and forced a yelp of pain.She set her teeth once more and rose with a cogent grunt, using her hatchets head as a prop.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her wounded foe rounded and reeled for another bout, but she wasnt ready.A sharp pain at her side revealed the round to be over before any chance for instinct to drive her arm.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Behind you, on the right! shouted Vidrick.Fiera gasped and twisted herself around, bringing her hatchet down with vicious intent.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It broke flesh, bone, and found meat and bone again before thundering against an outstretched oaks root.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Damn humans, quipped Vidrick.You cant sense the world around you, but insist on fighting it!

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fiera could not hear him, the blood draining from her side seemed to well in her ears.She drew shorter and shorter breaths, fighting desperately to hold her senses.In the end, she faltered and met the earth with a tender kiss.
##########
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Several shallowed breaths deepened as his eyes met those in the frame.Sunken, shadowed, and weathered, they were foreign now.No longer innocent, no longer nave, they were sieged by deep etched crow's talons.The grime and sweat mated across his face, yielding a haunting faade over once delicate features.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can you do it, boy?Come on, do it.Do it Do it! said his hostage, letting out whimpering laugh.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The boy knew he was goaded, but the pane and approached his prisoner nonetheless.Regal no longer applied to the King on the floor, bound and bloodied.His robes were caked in the refuse of his city, the annals of his castle, and both left the Kings eyes watery and wincing.Beneath the blood and much, a sneer was fixed to his face.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do you remember my name? asked the boy.He freed a dagger from his hip and raised the Kings head, pulled back on his hair, and held the weapons point over his eye.I asked if you know my name.No?I suppose you couldnt be bothered.Who remembers the name of their slave?What king cares for serfs, or mourns for their loss?My name, Majesty, said the boy, twirling his dagger in mock bow, is Arda.Named for your father, in fact.Ive never met the man, but Ive heard the stories.He was a monster of a man, wasnt he?Dead now, but in such spectacular fashion.He rode out on his sixtieth name day, fought and won what should have been your war, then died wedged between two whores half his age.Bards love stories like those, they write beloved songs about men like that.But you, Highness, will die here.You will die alone, awash in the shit of your own subjects and absent regal trappings or any credits to your defense.You, Veiter, will be remembered as the king who was kidnapped, the king so meek he was found dead, days later, bound and rotting in a puddle of shit.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The kings eyes met his own, briefly before blinking away tears and stifling a catch in his throat.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are you crying again? asked Arda.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, no.That wont do, compose yourself.Face it with dignity, face it as you force your slaves to face it.Come on now, said Arda.Veiter sniffed through tears and came to rest on his knees.Thats right, on your knees with your head held high.Thats how you made her face itstop crying.Stop crying!Make one more pathetic, whiny yelp and I will climb into that castle and kill your sons.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Veiters face hardened at this, his tears dried.Ah, there we are.Wouldnt want your line ended in a single night, would you?Though after Im done with you, branded regicide and patricide by the gods, I suppose fratricide wouldnt be any greater sin.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Veiter lowered his brow, studying Arda.Is that recognition?Have you figured it out?You have, havent you? asked Arda, gleeful.Thats right, Im your bastard boy come home.I suppose your own father wasnt clear enough, but the byproduct of raping your servant girls is often a thing like me.Bastards are not uncommon, of course, but you have the added sin of murdering my mother.Its unlikely you remember, but I do.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arda paused and furrowed his brow, hearing the pitter patter of royal boots on the street.He feverishly laughed to himself, Oh, you old devil.This silence was an act, you wanted to keep me talking.Maybe raise my voice a little and guide your guards to our affair. Arda smiled to himself and moved the daggers tip to his fathers jugular.A soft press freed a slow trickle of royal claret from his throat.Do you feel how sharp it is?This will be quick, and thats more than you deserve.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I suppose I should have seen it coming.Hindsight being what it is, I doubt this could have ended any other way.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It all began, as these things often do, with a whisper.Words in the right ear are stronger than fists to the right face, when properly plied and thoroughly planned.One summer afternoon, strangely colder than anticipated, a mere moments whisper broke the souls of thirty people.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The exam will consist of, she trailed off here, scribbling runic nonsense across white slate and turning back to chastise those furthest from her.I suppose she kept talking, but my mind wandered.I thought only of the quiet to come, the grit of her cries had smoothed away any semblance of interest from me and mine, but I stayed seated, twirling the pen between my fingers.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One, handwritten page of notes will be allowed

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then it came, cutting across her speech with vicious abandon, I thought she said no notes in the syllabus?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A quiet filled the room, everyones breath seemed to fade away, all at once.She rounded the fool, sitting nearest to the front and looked him in the eye.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is that what I said?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Y-yes maam, you were specific at the beginning of the semester, he stammered.Then the asshole had the nerve, had the constancy of character, to continue correcting her until she conceded the point.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now here we are: The day of the exam.To say Im fucked would be an overstatement, but I really needed that page of notes.I fought my way through the riddles scrawled across the page, stumbling over a few and striking down others.A call from the front forced down my pencil and spurred me toward a line of panicking students.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I handed my mangled papers into the proctor, who took them a little too eagerly, and followed my peers out the door.And there, at the head of the stairs was the fool.I wont lie to you, I felt the urge to jolt forward and press into him.One quick motion and hed be down the stairs.One quick motion and hes be bleeding across the waxed, white marble.It was tempting, oh so tempting.But my moment passed, and I was left impotent at the head of the steps as he rounded the second flight.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I stayed there a while, fantasizing he was spread eagle at the turn of the steps, but ultimately made my way to the ground floor.Theres always next semester, I mused.Ill be patient.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trumpets tremble when a good man goes to war.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Polished heels clatter against marbled streets,

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they give chase to virtue as Glory billows in the breeze;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fields bleed when a good man goes to war.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New wounds pave their path, 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a consecration of sanguine clay marks their journey.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Killers thrive when a good man goes to war.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their urges now bared and sins welcome,

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they rally behind the idols among them.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Good men die when they go to war.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They fall, not to bullets or bayonets, 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but to conscience burdened by years behind a rifles stock.//Thought I would try something different.(For me, anyway)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Graves stared across the salty plain, stunned by the sight before him.Here, five hundred light-years from home, humanity would make their first contact.Countless surveys and flybys gave them no idea of what to expect, this world was shrouded by something.Yet he here was, staring down a bastard amalgamation of every extraterrestrial humanity every concocted.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kepler-186f was the name the granted by people centuries dead, but Graves and his crew had taken to calling it something else: Shambhala.This planet was a sister to their Earth, long divided by the cosmos and likely never to meet her brood.Yet here they were, across the cosmos and armed for conquest.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Graves yanked the cords anchoring his parachute, one of the releases was jammed.An errant gust of warm spray kicked salt into the sheets, dragging him a few feet.With cautious quickness, he drew a ceramic blade from his left legs pouch and dragged the serrations across the width of the strap.He could scarcely hear the sound, but felt the vibrations through his gloves.Cutting through it likely made the same sound as a zipper dragged up and down.The figure opposite him reacted, taking a step of its own.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Graves tapped the smart panel built into the wrist of his suit, scrolling through the options to open communications.A touch of static in his earpiece greeted him as a signal was established, leading him to believe his suit damaged in the landing.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is Graves, he said.Nomad, please respond.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another creak of static, then a click, and finally, Nomad-Actual, respsonding. The dulcet tones of Captain Tripoli were in stark contrast to the woman herself, who left Graves with more than a measure of dread.Until meeting the captain, he joked there were only two women alive that kept him in like: his mother and his wife.Picking up interference on your end, whats happening down there?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are you not getting the video feed? asked Graves.I landed on my head, it may have damaged the instruments.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Copy, she said.What are you seeing?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, laughed Graves.Id radio home if I were you.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Im standing a stones throw from some tall, strange looking lifeform, said Graves.The long pause that followed afforded him the opportunity to advance a few paces and near the alien.It was now he first noticed the halos around its hands, a slowly rotating array of strange characters.He raised a hand and gave a slight wave, prompting the alien to mimic.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ring of characters rotated around four withered digits, the last opposed to the others.This opposable digit mimed an expression of scrolling, which Graves made a mental note of.An opposable digit seemed to be a staple of advanced civilizations, if this group of two was any indication.The alien tapped what amounted to its forefinger, lighting up a character on the ring and bringing up an image.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A blue sphere appeared between them, small and intangible-some form of hologram.Slowly it floated to Graves, stopping near his outstretched hand.It was now that the features began to fill in, continents and clouds covered the blue base.It rotated on a tilt and revealed crisper images, this wasnt Shambhalait was home.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What do you know about this? he asked the alien.Its quiet eyes remained fixed on him, and offered only a slight lean of its head as response.Dont pretend you cant understand, you know something- surely you know how to communicate.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its head tilted the other way, and its hands gave another scroll on the wheel.The forefinger tapped the air again, causing the small globe to spin in place.Graves' tiny world spun and burned.Small fires appeared across its continents, burning them away from the core and leaving only a blank blue world and clouds.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Graves, said the Captain.Mission control isnt responding, Im authorizing you to make contact.Were readying a landing party.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think Ive already made contact, Nomad, replied Graves.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What happened?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think it was a warning, answered Graves.The alien turned its head away from Graves as the sphere faded and began to walk away.Graves took a step toward it but faltered when he stared into the distance.A splash of red lights spanned the horizon, accompanied by the distinct hum of aircraft.Or a threat.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two men approached the withered skeleton of an old world beast, it stood sentry before a strange castle.Sands claimed much of the world, a byproduct of the breaking that left only scavengers.Any corpse in the badlands was cleaned without waste, leaving only the bones.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cant believe he shot the camels, that bastard.These tracks look fresh, said the first.He was older than his comrade, skin dried and cracked by the ages, but never surrendered the strength born of his frame.He stood a head taller than the other, necessitating a crook in his spine whenever he spoke.Scroll, you listening?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Scroll stared past the tall man, studying the strange castle walls.Tome, he finally said.Move your head, damn hat is blocking my view. Tomes hat eclipsed Scroll often, its comically wide brim was just shy of an umbrella most days.The lanky fellow raised himself and took a step away from the shorter, causing Scrolls eyes to blink and adjust to the burst of light.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The castles walls carried centuries of wear, the harsh sands had stripped bits to bare metal and varnished them with new rust.Characters across the face of them were fading, but still legible.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those old words in the distance, said Tome.Can you read them?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, I can read them, replied Scroll.Tome was always frustrated by his illiteracy, but in truth Scroll knew little more than him.The two had traveled together for three years now, with Scroll marking the days through a simple tally.Often the elder looked it over, fascinated by the crosses marking fives and boxes marking groups of ten or a hundred.You think he went in there?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell me what it says, he repeated.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Scroll knew the old fellow wouldnt stop until he answered, but he was fixated on the yellow plate hanging at the end of a pole dug wedged in the sands.On it was a familiar flower, one hed seen over the years.Scroll took a moment for himself, rubbing his tongue along the insides of his lower teeth and grimacing.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whats on your mind? asked Tome.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Black Trillium, replied Scroll.He took a step toward the yellow plate, clicking his tongue.If hes in there, hes dead.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Doesnt matter, said Tome.Old man wants him, or a body. He patted the colt on his hip and the thumbed the grip of the short sword on his back, confirming their integrity in his own way.Without another word he walked past the Black Trillium and a second dead beast of the old world, feigning a determination Scroll had seen on more than one occasion.It always ended in disaster.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Scroll gave a sigh and followed, he didnt like fights.There was a sawed off strapped to his back and a hatchet on his hip, but he wasnt built for battle.Sickness had withered him in his youth, and though he survived the ordeal it left him lean.Tome often compared Scrolls gaunt features to those of a skull, quipping the man was Scroll and bones. The man thought himself clever and ignored Scrolls attempts to correct him.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Crystal Corpor, said Scroll.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What now?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Writing on the wall, says Crystal Corpor.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Funny name for a castle, said Tome.He pointed to a structure wedged in front of the walls, a propeller and large, rotting frame.Know what that is?They called them zeppelinsflying machines.Thats right, flying machines.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ive heard the stories, replied Scroll.Flying machines broke the world, not strange to find one out here.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Badlands being what they are, I bet you dont know what those glass domes are, said Tome.The man couldnt read, but he had more than a fair share of trivia under that hat.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I certainly dont.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, kings in this desert-, he began.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A whistle silenced the old fellow, who spun around and scowled past Scroll.He nodded to his comrade, who turned in kind, and stared down the approaching figures.Sand colored garb hid their greater features, but the rifles were entirely exposed.The two were outnumbered a dozen to one.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shit, grimaced Tome.He raised his arms and stood in place, rolling his eyes as they neared.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least were in the right place, laughed Scroll.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a typical day, the sort that blends into the week and fades from memory.I strolled down the cracking pavement that led to my classroom, past faceless people craning their heads into little worlds nestled in their palms.You would assume nothing of note would happen this day, but then came the light.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her smile was sudden, the only face I could, or wanted, to remember.A swelling of my heart forced a smile to match, but she turned away.I swear her eyes met mine, fixed on me as turned into a classroom, my classroom.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Go sit by her,* said the first thought, I named it Rash.I never trusted this one, not since it convinced me snitch to Casey Ray back in grade five.That particular decision led to half a dozen years of torment, and wasnt one I was eager to repeat.Then again, it was making sense today.*Trust me, go sit by her.*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Youre making sense, she did smiled at me, I said.One of the faceless cranes look up at me, wearing a newly puzzled mask- brows narrowed and low.What?Never heard a guy talk to himself? They became faceless once more, but I regretted napping at them.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *That wasnt your best moment, but ignore the advice to stalk the poor girl,* piped up a second, proclaimed as Fearful.*She smiled at you, dont make more of it than it is.*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Trust me, this is our chance,* retorted Rash.*Listen to that fool again and we will be alone.*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Again?Like the years weve spent on the outside because you refuse to think things through?* cackled Fearful.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You two need to come to a consensus, or Im going with my gut, I said.Easing my way through the door, I entered the room.My issue was seated toward the upper middle rows of the auditorium style room, she gave another glance walked down the steps and returned to looking ahead.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Now we have to,* said Rash.*Did you see what I saw?*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *I saw a girl spare passing glance,* replied Fearful.*Get yourself under control.*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I stood on the steps as people moved past me, frozen between her aisle and the one behind.Someone needed to make a decision, and someone needed to make it soon.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *All of you need to shut up,* shouted a new, familiar voice.Reason: old, reliable, and often ignored.*Sit in the row behind her and leave a gap, I could have solved this in five seconds.Fucking amateurs.*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Unless she has no interest and we get too close for comfort,* squealed Fearful.*We need to sit in front of her, two or three rows down.* 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Sit next to her or spend another year alone,* growled Rash.*This is so fucking simple.*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *I want both of you to shut up,* snapped Reason.*Ive always had the right answers and hes ignored me because of you two!*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Right answers?Youre the worst, at least we know when were wrong,* said Rash.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will everyone just shut the fuck up?! I shouted.All eyes in the room turned toward me, confused and somewhat alarmed.I bit my lip and knew from the burning at the ends of my ears I was a shade of scarlet to rival Catholic Cardinals.With one last glance at the smiling girl, I lowered my head and hurried up the stairs.To complicate matters, I stumbled twice in my haste and bit the wall of my cheek as my thoughts bickered.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *See what youve done now?* snorted Reason.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I stumbled again, but opted to stay down.My head came to rest on the steps and I let out a sigh, You all really fucked this up.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are you alright? asked a voice, sweet and cool.I raised my head and saw the object of my affection, or rather my affliction, walk past and come to a rest a step above.My eyes traced over her smile and rested on her own bright hazels, curled by true amusement.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; UhII, yeah.Yep, Im good, I said.As I began to prop myself up, she offered a hand to steady myself.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *See?I was right,* teased Rash.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Just fuck off, please,* said Reason.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Shes going to break our hearts,* sighed Fearful.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I saw it once, insisted the boy, marching behind his kin.Aellas was youngest among them, but his voice boomed loudest against empty halls.I saw the sky, the whole sky!


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sure you have, replied Baethal, the eldest of Aellas relations.Where the boy was short, childish, and rash, his kinsman was hardened, wise, and patient.Aellas knew he would learn much from the man, but often resented his place at the back of their troupe.Youve seen the sky, and Im secretly the King on the Roof.Isnt that right, lads?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bellowing agreement came from the men ahead of them, seated around several small lanterns and wrapped in blankets.This was a dead floor, the powers of the elders long lost from its veins.Walls peeled away, revealing bronzed arteries and soft tissue packed tight within.Aellas had marched for three months now, climbing the ersatz staircases scattered upon each floor.Their goal was Ascendance, a land of plenty rumored above the dead floors, but few had seen.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every passing floor taught them one thing, the elders road existed.Barred behind thick iron doors, the elders road offered an easy path to the top.Aellas glanced across the room, to one of the elders doors.A small pane of glass once offered insight on the other side, but now it was shrouded.There was a rumor amongst those on his home level, a rumor that a drunk forced his way through an iron door years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Baeth, said Aellas.Do you really think those doors are guarded?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Baethal paused at this, frowning toward the door.Ive told you to forget about it, he replied.Elder way, or not, those doors lead only to a swift death.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that man, he went through the doors and never came back, said Aellas.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, he came back, replied Baethal.His kinsman set his jaw and stared at the door, measuring his thoughts before continuing.Some of him came back, at least.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some of him?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You were still a babe at the time, said Baethal.We found his head outside the door one morning.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just his head?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, just his head, replied Baethal.Thats why were taking the long climb, across all these dark floors, so we dont meet the same fate.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We would have been better off searching for Radical, growled one of the men ahead of them.His name was Everynn, a loathsome drunk who harassed Aellas over the years, but he was a fearsome fighter and well welcomed on this expedition.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Radical doesnt exist, replied Baethal.We go up, we find people.We go down, we die.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We go up, people kill us, retorted Everynn.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Youre welcome to leave, said Baethal.Aellas watched the drunk rise and shed his blankets, brandishing a gleaming hatchet.Put that away, or Ill sheath it in your skull.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Funny, snorted Everynn.I had a similar idea.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You were going to kill yourself? asked Aellas.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shut up you little 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His words faded away as a rumble came from the floor above, shaking the whole structure

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bad, said Crag.Every night, his kinsfolk gathered around that dancing flower.Every night they stoked the petals and exposed themselves.Every night he warned them.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bad, he repeated, as they walked past.Crag had joined them the first day, joined as they gathered around the new light in endless night.Hed come closer any of the others, bringing his hand nearest the petals.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His courage threatened this thing, this light, so he was the first to feel its bite.Crag clenched this bitten hand, now dried and razed, as the number approaching the light grew greater.Danger, he continued feebly as they passed.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It mattered little, they were enthralled by the bulb of dancing light.Crag watched from a distance as they brought tribute, gathered branches and bits of greenery.A lone figure walked back from the light, eclipsing the gathering and settled beside him.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Crag, it said.Join us.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, elder, said Crag.That thing is wrong.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is a gift, said the Elder.Or perhaps a challenge, one to bring us the rains.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We should leave, said Crag.No food, no waterwe should leave.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, said the Elder.He rose, shaking his head, and walked back to the group.Join us, Crag.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Crag ignored the Elder, watching as a new group came to join the fray.They carried great bushels of thick leaved plants, bound together with vines, to the heart of the light.The lands had dried over the past months, leaving fewer and fewer options for their people.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, in the dead of night, a spark of light from the sky crashed into the world and became worshiped.The newest bushels were added to the light, prompting awe.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A great plume of black fog billowed from its heart, spreading across the nameless shadows gathered round.In time, joviality took hold.Great dances began, a wild flailing of limbs and primal cries around this heart of light.Crag watched, stoic, as the youngest among them began jumping through it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One after another, they jumped.Each was more eager than the last, emboldened by the success of their peers.The elders jeered, adopting this mock right-of-passage in their new stupor, and began chanting old words.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stupid light, whispered Crag.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was broken from his distaste by the shouts that echoed from within the crowd.Slowly it began to part, revealing a second light.FIYA! it screamed, prancing about the crowd and patting itself.FIYA!FIYA!FIYA! The screams echoed greater harm with each utterance, and, finally, the cries won out.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FIYA! it whimpered once more.The youngster, bathed in otherworldly light, crumpled before the gathered tribe.A blackened faade formed across its hide, and it cried no more.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whos the random? DreadFork asked.He shouldered his M1 Garand and looked down its sights, remembering his grandfathers drunken musing, Shes an old piece, but still true. The boat shook, breaking his aim and returning attention to the crew.The man opposite him said nothing, prompting him to ask once more: Hey, Jaime, whos the random?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dude, what the fuck?You know its CamelKing, replied Ja--CamelKing.Shes cool man, dont worry about it.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cool, sure, grimaced DreadFork.He looked to the remainder of his group: Dozer, Silvering, and EnWard.They were armored and armed for the Triangle, ready to storm the last mystery of the world, but the random wasnt.Jaimes friend had no notable armor and a lone revolver on her hip, slung across her was a satchel emblazoned with a six sided star.She doesnt look ready.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its fine, she can back one of us up, said Silvering.She was playing with her knife, looking at the random between twirls and smirking to herself.As long as Jaime does his job, well be fine.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CamelKing, corrected Jaime.Actually, shes going to take my place as medic.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All eyes found him, but Dozer was the first to speak out.The fuck you mean shes the medic? he asked in his gruff, low voice.He turned to the random and snarled, Whats in the pack? 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She recoiled but EnWard was faster, he snatched the satchel and tossed it to Dozer.He rummaged through the contents and frowned, Three bandages and some morphine, are you fucking serious?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Itll be fine, Ill be the backup-, began Jaime.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fuck off Jaime, said Silvering.Just fucking do your job, we can handle the enemies.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hey, those supplies arent cheap, snapped Jaime.You going to give me a bigger share for fixing your asses up?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bullets cost more than bandages, dumbass, said EnWard.You do your job, Jaime, and she can use that pea-shooter to try and help.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hell with that! shouted Jaime.Turn this thing around, Im not playing support again.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes you are, said Dozer.He usually had the last word, but Jaime was irate.Suddenly, a voice bubbled up from the water.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Turn back, it said.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Too late now, said DreadFork.Enough bickering, were here so lets do it live. The group readied as fog rose from the sea to hide the way forward, hide the emptiness of the Triangle.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please, turn back, it repeated.Violent winds thrashed against them as the boat began to shake.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have a bad feeling, said Silvering, struggling to hold onto her seat.We might have to turn back.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No!Everything is fine, were going to break through the.., he fell silent as his head began to shake.Feeling your brain rattle around your head is no easy thing to shake off, pardon the pun, but DreadFork managed to still it a moment and saw his friends suffering the same fate.The random walked forward, to the stern of their boat and tried to stare out into the fog.Winds caught her hair and with a last violent gust sent it flying.Wait, are you a gu-.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But DreadFork never finished his question, their ship crumpled against some unseen force and rendered the random to red paste.He watched Jaime, Silvering, Dozer, and EnWard splatter against it, one after the other before his moment came.Seconds spread when youre about to die, allowing DreadFork to shoulder his weapon and fire defiantly at the barrier.Still true, he mused before shutting his eyes.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I ran my fingers across the wall, feeling carved notations of branching decisions.Everything began with a rope.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There were two choices that day: tie a noose around my neck or leash the wandering pup sniffing at my pack, lured by soiled gym clothes.I chose the noose and the pup ran.They cut me down and dragged me into the ambulance past Mrs. Needler, the nosy landlady, with a triumphant grin slashed across her comical lips.Strapped to the stretcher I turned my head away from the aging bitch, now reveling in the vindication of her unwarranted spying, and saw the lonesome pup wedged beneath the rear passenger tire of a blue and green ambulance.I didnt die that day, they locked me away for a month with treatments and counseling until I forgot myself.Here, in the afterlife, I saw that day as it could have been.I could have leashed the pup and walked the neighborhood with my new friend, eventually running into a frantic young woman shouting Skip! into the night.I could have done that, spent time with the nubile, auburn haired girl until we fell deeply for one another.I could have watched as Skip was joined by my own brood: Elizabeth, Erin, or Eddie.Those were my options, but I chose the rope.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pulled my fingers back from the carvings, leaving my left index pressed to the forking decision.The rope.I followed this choice down the line, past the institution that saddled me with her.Broken people find other broken people, this is made easier when were locked up together.My own demons found hers, they mingled and meddled until we became inseparable.So came the chapter of Amy.This is where things came to a head, her perversion- her love- of knives made the end easier.Six months down the line, I woke to the silver-blonde poking at my forearms with a short switch.A sinister smile was plastered on her face, lips open and teeth ajar.Her tongue ran across the bottoms of her upper teeth, something about it made me worry.I tried to ask, to find out what she wanted but there was no chance.She dug her blade deep into my outstretched arm and pulled it away from me, carving a deep valley.I dont remember what happened to her, I didnt see it.I faded away as she dipped a finger into the pooling red and brought it to her lips, arched tongue moving to meet it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And here I am, dead and gone.It turns out the afterlife isnt anything special, just an eternity in an empty room living out all your What ifs. The wall never ended, it ran in either direction into the endless nothing no matter how far I walked.My only companion was a lone crow perched atop my carrion corpse, pecking at it while I walked the wall.I turned to the crow, sparing a single glance for my rotting form spread across the floor, and asked, Is this it?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No reply came.Short of breath I turned back to the wall, looking at the web spread before me.All the things I could have been, all the dreams I could have lived, and fell to my knees.The tapestry of my life was nothing more than recollections, decisions, and failures etched across time.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is the point of this? I asked the crow, turning once more.Tell me! I stepped toward the crow, but the space between us spread in proportion.I dont understandI dont

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sitting on my knees, I shut my eyes and bowed my head to the ground.Then came the Caw! I bolted up, seeing no crow and spiraled in place.Gone was body, innards and all.Gone was the crow, with a sole call.I look at my wall, blank and smooth.Gone was my life, along with my truths.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Accolades fade, my brothers.Time sees to that, forcing fighters into obscurity after the parades and festivals come to their inevitable ends.Monotony sets in, apathy takes hold and, finally, heroes are forgotten.Only our legend lives on, distorted and disparaged from the man who forged it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Minstrels sing of how, forty years past, I slew the Dread-lord of Erendal in single combat.The ballads claim I forced my batter and dulled blade through his heart, ending the White-Will rebellion and hanged the slain form over his castles portcullis.Minstrels are liars.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poets claim I rode to the castle gates atop a mountainous steed, clad in pitch black armor, and clutching at a blade adorned in gilded roses.My steed, with its fire-like mane and fierce red eyes charged through the gates, burning them down.In truth, I wore leathers.In truth, I rode a brown nag.In truth, I carried a simple blade I stole from the corpse of an industrious, but foolish, bandit.Poets are deluded.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was a hero, my brothers.I was known across the kingdom, just not by my true name.They dubbed me Sir Alford of Whistle Spring, but that was never my name.My name is Ali and I was born in the east, a small town named Burrows Pass.Simple names and unknown hometowns make for poor pedigree where heroes are concerned, so I was Sir Alford.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Long ago kings knew my name, welcomed me to their courts, and threw great banquets in my honor.They offered their finest liquors and liveliest women, sating any desire I could name and several I could not.Those were grand times, but a decade on memory began to fade.The old sires were replaced by younger lords, eager to claim themselves Sir Alfords equal.When I arrived at their gates, they turned me away stating that I was a liar.I was no hero, just a vagrant claiming legend.Their fathers failed them, taught them nothing of the man who secured their birthrights.Humiliated, I left for the Highlands and cursed the trend of the young discarding history.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thirty years in these mountains, tending to my crop and raising my children taught me one thing: Fortune favors the bold.Two days past, a lone rider from one of those presumptive kings rode into my lands bearing royal decree my homestead was to be levied for taxes.I took my rusted old blade, sharpened to a keener edge than the Dread-lord met, and loosed the mans head from his form.Heroes are forgotten and legends are distorted in memory, but villains are feared long after their passing.I claim dominion over these Highlands with my commoners blood, and challenge any who would deny me to single combat.Tell your lords to come, tell them to find me so I may leave them bloodied across the slopes.The time of kings is over, my brothers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I peeked around the corner, flecks of brick falling away from the old office building.Another volley forced me back, but I counted three shooters now.Green-sleeves by the look of them, inked with two emerald dragons, intertwined, on either arm.I took one quick, deep breath and peered at the building opposite me.It was practically identical, this had been a business park once, but scrawled across its brick in fading neon orange was Bad people ahead, turn back. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have listened, I should have run.You dont fuck with Green-sleeves in this particular area of the city, Mercer runs his own personal kingdom.Why was I here again?Exploring?I think I was exploring, but why did I turn into this alley?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A break in their fire convinced me to peer around the corner once more, probably bait but what else was I going to do?I checked the chamber and shouldered my rifles stock, leaned into my right foot and pivoted to look down the range.Three men, reloading their weapons stared back at me and shouted incoherent drivel spiced with clear profanities.I looked down my sights and curled my finger to the trigger, but suddenly I was struck dumb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you doing? a voice asked from behind me, a little hoarse and clearly not my own.Was this some magic, was this the trap?Ive told you a hundred fucking times, dont touch my stuff. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another voice, younger and bemused, replied, Im helping you, look where you are now.Mercers territory, we can kill some Green-sleeves and make it look like Dead-heads did it.I read about onlin- 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goddammit.Give me that, said the hoarse voice.If I wanted to start a war with Green-sleeves I would have, fucker.And you used all the save slots? 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting here was harder than I expected, said the young voice.I had to quick save like 4 times just to reach this alley. I heard a slapping sound, followed by what could have been a brawl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im telling mom, snarled the hoarse voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excuse me, I said.WhoWhat? I wasnt sure quite what to say.Were there gods in my head?People had preached for centuries that we were all actors, playing roles to bemuse deities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since when does he talk? The hoarse voiced waited for reply.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dont know, first time Ive heard it. The younger addressed me directly now, This is a private conversation. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private my ass, I shouted.Im not some puppet! 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut up, said the hoarse voice.Well, what can I do now 90 hours in, Im not starting over, I guess we kill some Green-sleeves. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, said the young.Suddenly my hands were unfrozen, my eyes focused once more on the sights.Ill use the RPG, we can hit the one the middle and knock the other two off their feet. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empty barrel of an RPG appeared in my hands, spurring me to reach into my endless pack and retrieve its ordinance.As I loaded, the hoarse voice said, Hey, hand it over.Youve messed up my day enough. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just let me do this, said the younger.I just want to blow them up. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im saving the RPG rounds, theyre the only way to take out Marauder heavies in the badlands.Dont waste them, said the hoarse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im not going to spam them, I just want to use one. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only have 3, said the hoarse.Give me the goddamn controller! 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My foes had taken the time to reload their weapons, and they readied to aim.The RPG in my hands was ready, but my fingers couldnt find the trigger.Within me, I heard the shouting.The hoarse and younger shouted profanities at one another and crashed about- at least I assumed as much from the sounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let go!Let go!Let go! shouted the hoarse.Suddenly my aim shifted left, squared on the wall and released the rocket.I flew back, bouncing off what must have been the other office building.Bright lights, no sounds, and hovering over my eyes: Game over.Youre dead.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a holy war, the tall figure repeated.He stood at the head of our group, the ends of his long, white robes caught in the wind like errant flakes of confetti.They twisted and curled amongst themselves, but always came free.I stood in the first row and looked down, my own simple white tunic and pants were stagnant.He looked at me as I raised my head once more, or I have to assume he looked at me.In place of a face, there was only white light.I could make out a jaw, a beard, and long white hair- you know, all the typical deific features.Yet there was no face, only the blinding white light.We are engaged in a fight for all things, for creation itself.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You were all sinners in your own way, he continued, walking along the front row.Sinners in life, sinners that strayed from my path. He returned to me, paused and placed a hand on my shoulder.Sinners who doubted my very existence.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At once I felt peace, a warmth that reached from the seat of my stomach to my heart and spread to every limb.Divinity, thats the closest word to what I experienced.I felt my knees buckle, my heart race, and my eyes dim.It wasnt a fade to black, more a blanket of light.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I woke now, alone.My cohorts had vanished and I lay flat on a bed.After a failed attempt to raise myself up, I turned my head to the left and studied the place.White walls and wide windows with an assortment of beds, completely empty.I was dead, of that much I was certain.But this place, it was some kind of infirmarywas I dreaming before?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I frowned at my doubt and turned my head right.Beside me sat the faceless man, casually reading through some nameless text.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morning, child, he said.Forgiveness is a difficult process, but acceptance takes a greater toll.I have forgiven your sins, child, and now you have accepted them.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He gave a wave of his hand my strength returned, and heGodwalked through the white doors directly opposite my bed and I followed.In lieu of a hallway, we merely left the room and arrived in another.I looked back, expecting to see the last but instead only saw a web of smoke draping the doorway.I, I began before my voice retreated.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You always were one to question, one to fight, said God.I liked that about you, despite your reservations about myself. He gestured toward a web of smoke to my right, *Luxuria* stamped across its arch in silver.As humans live, they sin.It is inevitable, it is natural, and it is forgivable.I only ask that you serve me, fight with me against the forces which conspire to keep you mired in your sin.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Words found me at last, What forces?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mortality is only the beginning, life is a test, God said.Eternity is greater, woven in the fabric of reality and something youve scarcely imagined.I need those willing to fight, willing to defend my creations from all those who would steal it.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was confused now, God was realand fighting some kind of meta-terrestrial war Who are you fighting? I asked.You need soldiers, I think I understand, but who are you fighting?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those who dare to think themselves my equal, God snarled.He walked into the webbed doorway and vanished.After a moment of consideration, I followed.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lust wasnt what I expected, though to be fair I wasnt sure what I expected.When you hear lust, I suppose you think of an orgy.Something visceral and vivid, but not this.I found emptiness, a dark empty hall void of any manner or method.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What do you see?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I see nothing, I replied.God walked away from my side and toward the doorway.Wait! I called.What was I supposed to see?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spindles of light and sound spilled from my feet and revealed the room, revealing its contents.Heaving breasts, raised phalluses, blooming roses and the heavy scent of longingMore than Id imagined.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We walked in silence for a time, down the halls and into subsequent rooms.*Gula* left me hungry, raised tables and splendid company.*Invidia* forced me to revisit old jealousies, rekindle old rivalries.Neither proved to be my aptitude.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We will find you a place, said God.Everyone finds their home, sooner or later.Worry not, for when you are surrounded my like-minded brothers and sisters in arms all of this will be a distant memory.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His soldiers, his fighters, were encouraged to spend their eternity immersed in sin.Sin breeds stronger fighters than virtue, because a sinner will always fight to keep what they have.*Avaritia* clearly showed me that, for there were thousands upon thousands of hoarders gathered round great keeps of gold and stone.They hid themselves in their wealth, their precious worldly things, and waited for great battles.God gave them what they wanted, gave them a way to live without judgment.In exchange, they gave him their service.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It seems Im far from the beaten path now, I said.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Ira* or *Acedia*, mumbled the faceless form.Well find your way. We found me inappropriate for both.All the while, I was asking questions about his adversaries.They are the enemy, the enemy of this place, was all he said.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now what? I asked as we left the dimension of *Ira.* What happens to those who dont fit into your houses? As I finished the question, I recalled there was a seventh option.What about pride?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The white light which hid the mans face began to darken.In place of what was blank, a crooked nose and deep set eyes appeared.His brow was scarred and wrinkled, liver spots dotting his face and neck.You he spat.You and your fucking will... you must believe!

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A hand darted from the robes and caught me around the throat, nails digging deep into my skin.This hand, which once left me weak-limbed and warm was now cold and weak.I took his wrist with my left hand and began to twist, I took my right and pulled at his fingers.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who are you? I managed through gasps.I tore myself from his grasp and darted back, What the fuck are you? Then, as if by epiphany, I asked What the fuck am I?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Non-believer, the old man whispered.Enemy!

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next in line, please, said Kent.Yes, he was demon named Kent.Not every demon gets the grand, imposing name you hear about in stories.Not all of them are called Phenex, Beleth, Asmoday, or Dantalion.Kent was his name, Kent the glorified travel agent.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A spindly thing approached his desk and sat down.Kent let out two chirps of tongue and began tapping the return key on his keyboard, clearing his screen and asked, How can we help you today?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, said the spindly thing.Duke Crocell handed me this, it produced a slick black stone with glowing red runes.And instructed I report to this office.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, said Kent.He took the stone in hand, contrary to its appearance it was ice cold.Everything in hell burned, everything in hell was too hot for other realms.So the spirits in charge invented these stones, these passports.Crocell, he said, opening up windows on his screen.CrocellCrocell

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is this place? it asked.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ah, heres Crocell, said Kent.Oh, been three centuries since anyone was recommended.You must have done something impressive. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I just did my job, it said.The thing had no face, no limbs, and no mouth.The disembodied echo found its way to Kent though, he assumed it must be telepathic.It had the all the markings of a being from Tau Ceti, and they were a strange race.Kent originated from Sol, so to him the thing sitting at his desk looked like a potted plant whose stalks were entombed by coiled bones.You didnt answer my question.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apologies, said Kent.This is your lucky day Miss, he paused and waited.Hoping hed guessed the gender correctly.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its Mister, it corrected.AdXanai PielDona.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AdXanax, repeated Kent.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AdXanai, he corrected.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right, said Kent, pulling open a drawer and producing several brochures.Well, sir, I think you may be interested in possessions in Tau Ceti, Luytens Star, Teegardenmaybe Alpha Centauri, it is lovely this century.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was thinking your Sol, replied AdXanai.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sol?Well, we can certainly do that, said Kent.Now did you have a length of possession in mind?Your passport entitles you to minimums and maximums, but I really want to get an idea of what you have in mind before we look into packages.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I mean, Ive heard about possessions from some of Dantalions legionnaires, but never knew this was how it happened.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its one Hells few, well-kept secrets and we intend to keep it that way.Which reminds me Kent opened another drawer, on his left this time, and placed a clipboard in front of AdXanai.Non-disclosure agreement, boiler plate stuff, said Kent, snickering at his own cleverness.It informs you that the boss, the big boss- you know, the Devil- reserves the right to torture and maim your soul for no less than 10,000 years in the event of a breach.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AdXanai took his time reading over the paperwork, it was amusing to see how the pages simply floated from one to the next.Kent was pleased he had been right about the telepathic bit, though telekinetic would have been more accurate.After a while, AdXanai said, Ive read over Terran history, could we look at 6 months with Stalin?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am terribly sorry sir, but this is an entry level passport and only entitles you to current-Earth.Trans-temporal displacements are reserved centuries in advance and require alook, Im sorry, but youre qualified.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What would you recommend then?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, Earth isnt very popular right now.Most of our guests are more interested in the Inter-planetary conflict in Upsilonnever mind.Lets see Kent began scrolling through his monitors page, pausing and grinning before turning his attention back to AdXanai.I have the perfect package for you.An eight month possession, beginning immediately, in the United States 2016 Presidential Election.There is a man running, who I think would be the perfect host for you.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I saw it once, insisted the boy, marching behind his kin.Aellas was youngest among them, but his voice boomed loudest against empty halls.I saw the sky, the whole sky!

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sure you have, replied Baethal, the eldest of Aellas relations.Where the boy was short, childish, and rash, his kinsman was hardened, wise, and patient.Aellas knew he would learn much from the man, but often resented his place at the back of their troupe.Youve seen the sky, and Im secretly the King on the Roof.Isnt that right, lads?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bellowing agreement came from the men ahead of them, seated around several small lanterns and wrapped in blankets.This was a dead floor, the powers of the elders long lost from its veins.Walls peeled away, revealing bronzed arteries and soft tissue packed tight within.Aellas had marched for three months now, climbing the ersatz staircases scattered upon each floor.Their goal was Ascendance, a land of plenty rumored above the dead floors, but few had seen.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every passing floor taught them one thing, the elders road existed.Barred behind thick iron doors, the elders road offered an easy path to the top.Aellas glanced across the room, to one of the elders doors.A small pane of glass once offered insight on the other side, but now it was shrouded.There was a rumor amongst those on his home level, a rumor that a drunk forced his way through an iron door years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Baeth, said Aellas.Do you really think those doors are guarded?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Baethal paused at this, frowning toward the door.Ive told you to forget about it, he replied.Elder way, or not, those doors lead only to a swift death.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that man, he went through the doors and never came back, said Aellas.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, he came back, replied Baethal.His kinsman set his jaw and stared at the door, measuring his thoughts before continuing.Some of him came back, at least.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some of him?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You were still a babe at the time, said Baethal.We found his head outside the door one morning.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just his head?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, just his head, replied Baethal.Thats why were taking the long climb, across all these dark floors, so we dont meet the same fate.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We would have been better off searching for Radical, growled one of the men ahead of them.His name was Everynn, a loathsome drunk who harassed Aellas over the years, but he was a fearsome fighter and well welcomed on this expedition.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Radical doesnt exist, replied Baethal.We go up, we find people.We go down, we die.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We go up, people kill us, retorted Everynn.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Youre welcome to leave, said Baethal.Aellas watched the drunk rise and shed his blankets, brandishing a gleaming hatchet.Put that away, or Ill sheath it in your skull.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Funny, snorted Everynn.I had a similar idea.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You were going to kill yourself? asked Aellas.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shut up you little 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His words faded away as a rumble came from the floor above, shaking the whole structure
