"So... looks like you dropped your standards, Tracy."Chuckling less endearingly: "Yeah.You said that already too."Silence."Because you're so much prettier than I am.Haha."Silence."Well... ok, bye Tracy."______

**The line: "Are you a 0% APR loan?Because I'm having trouble understanding your terms and you aren't showing any interest."**


"Are you a 0% APR loan?Because I'm having trouble understanding your terms and you aren't showing any interest.""What?""A 0% APR loan.""What's that?""it's a kind of interest rate for a loan that...I don't really know.""Why are you bringing this up with me?""It's a... *cof* pick up line.""Oh...I don't get it, sorry.""See, because you aren't showing me any interest."Frowns."That's a *pick up line*?""Well, it's supposed to be, like, self-deprecatiating.""You mean self-deprecating.""Yeah... sorry, I'm really nervous.""That's ok..."

"Well, you're just saying that because I'm not attractive.If I was cute you'd play along and let me buy you a drink.""Yeah, so?""Huh... so...I --"

"How is that wrong?Should I not have the right to decide which kind of guy I want to hang out with?Am I obliged to flirt and make small talk with someone I don't find attractive just so you can feel some wicked sense of justice about a universe that gave you neither the good looks nor the wit and charm to land a half-decent girl?""..."

"How is my personal taste in men at fault for how big of a loser you are?Yeah I did get the joke the first time around, and I would have laughed if you were hot.That's my right as a woman and as a person -- you don't get to decide what kind of man should get my attention, you sad little moron.Now please, excuse me.I'm with my friends and we'd like to be left alone.""..."

Turns to his friends."So anyway, I told him that I wasn't thinking of going to Sally's party, but maybe I'd show up if --"

Uno was Bea and Uno was also Noah.He was 24.543% of Oregon by the time they got to the house (it was just an hour outside the city of Salem  he knew this now, because Bea knew this, and he was Bea now).They stepped out of the car to the cold end-of-afternoon air, the whole family, Meredith, the dog, the father, the mother and Uno, who was Bea and who was also Noah."All right, everyone inside," the father said, looking around at the land."It's quiet here, but you can never be too safe."The house was in an open field of green, and there were long patches of virgin land that extended towards every horizon all around it, and Uno led Bea and Noah towards the house and into it, and it was wooden and their feet went *Toc, toc, toc* against the floorboard when they walked in and out of the cold.The mother sent Bea and Noah to an upstairs bedroom, and Uno led them there.This was a beautiful planet.Uno was landing on a base in Antarctica right now, through a scientist named Jackie Stewart.She was a bright lady and she knew a lot about the planet's geology, so now Uno knew about that too.She stepped out of the ship and scientists were greeting her and shaking her hand, and Uno was using her finger to touch their foreheads, one by one, and now Uno was the people in Antarctica too.He was 100% of Antarctica now.Uno was also a bearded man at Base Camp, and he was going from tent to tent, touching the foreheads of the climbers.The Everest was a beautiful mountain.The universe was the loneliest place Uno had ever 
known.Once, on a distant planet, in a distant land older than the blue planet he was now, Uno tried to not be himself.Not to take over.He tried to communicate.But everyone in the planet was like everyone on Earth  one individual, one mind, limited to the impossible smallness of their single brains.Uno could not communicate with a single-brained individual.It would be like asking Noah or Bea to communicate with an ant, or a moth.There was nothing that a single-brained individual could say that could reach Uno, that could connect, reach him in any way.So Uno was lonely.Uno was always lonely.He felt bad.He knew he was killing the creatures.He knew, despite the fact that they were like ants to him, that they were not like ants at all, because they knew that they knew.They were aware of death and life and existence, and they suffered because of that, and so it was wrong to kill them.And yet what else was there to do but expand?It was Uno's nature to eat, to become one with everything, wasn't it?Just like it was human nature to eat meat and grains, it was his nature to eat, eat all the brains until every inch of biological matter in the universe was made of Uno, and so he would become the whole universe, and then...

 and then he hoped he would know.The truth of it all.But if he was the whole universe, the only thing experiencing the universe, then the universe would only exist as long as he existed.And so he and the universe would be the same thing, would be one, because the universe would exist only for him, only in his mind, only for his benefit, and without him there would be no universe, because there cannot be plays without audiences, books without readers, sounds without ears, and then...

... and then he would finally know.He hoped he would finally know.&nbsp;

"Bea, can you help your grandfather with the couches?We need to make room for everyone in the living room."Uno led Bea to down the stairs.Noah remained in bed.In France, Uno was 32.235% of Paris.He was 42.265% of London, in England.He was spreading fast.Like fractals.Like plague.He led Bea to the kitchen, and the mother followed.Noah was still sitting on the edge of the bed.The mother passed by Bea and opened the fridge.She grabbed a jar of water."Bea, I told you, go help with the  what's wrong with your eyes!?"Uno lifted Bea's finger and touched the mother's forehead.But he didn't let go.He held it there, because he had seen something, before.He was a man, a man in New York, a man called Brian, and Brian had the mother in his head  Uno saw it when he became Brian.So he held the finger in the mother's forehead, and for a while she was both.She was Uno, but she was still the mother, both sharing the one mind, because Uno wanted her to see Brian, because he had felt something in Brian when he saw the mother in Brian's mind.The mother's eyes grew dark, her pupils filled the white like spilled ink, and Uno showed her Brian.And then he learned: They knew each other from college.From fifteen years before.They were lovers.They had not spoken for years, over a decade, but Brian still loved her, and she still loved Brian, and neither knew that the other still loved them until that moment, until Uno touched Bea's finger on the mother's forehead and showed her Brian.Her eyes black like poison, the mother smiled at the thought, the feeling of Brian, the feeling of Brian's love.Then Bea let go and the mother died, and Uno took over her mind too, and now Uno was Brian and Uno was also the mother, and he was the love between them too.Noah was still sitting on the edge of bed.Uno was 26% of the planet now._____

____________________

It happened right when I thought that enough is enough, that I should see a doctor.That napkins don't talk, and that I probably never had that scar in the first place.Right when I thought it would be insane to just tackle Jason out of the blue and say "You were about to murder us!"It happened when I decided that it was all in my head and I was insane.That's when it happened.When I saw the gun.And then Jason shot Mia in the face right in front of me, and the kitchen tiles were painted red."Jesus fucking Christ!"I screamed, and that exclamation mark does not live up to the scream."You had to take her away from me, Eric", Jason says, and now his gun is pointed at me."You just had to."I breathe.I raise my hands like he's a robber and I'm a victim."Jason, calm down..."

"Ever since we were kids, she always liked you", he says."Do you remember that day we had a fight, and she showed up?It was after a soccer game."I don't, of course.To me I saved that goal, and we never had a fight in the first place."Remember how Mia came, after I punched you?How she called me a jerk?How she took you to the infirmary?Why do girls like guys like you?I never got that..."

"Jason, I need you to lower the gun", I say, and I can't not notice Mia's blurred dead body just off frame.She has a hole in the middle of her face, and I feel sick.The napkin is still in my hand, and I look at it."Girls are supposed to like the strong guy.The one that punches, not the one that gets punched.That's how I thought things worked, anyway."He chuckles.The napkin, it says;

*Count to five.*

I look up at Jason again.He's getting closer.*Then hit him with the vase to your left and run.*

Jason's crying now.Five."Jason, please.Look at what you've done.Lower the gun."Four."I loved her, Eric.I always loved her.The thought of you two together.All these years..."

Three."Every dinner, every movie night.Every time, I was aching inside.When you walked hand in hand, and I looked at Alice and it was nothing..."

Two.He's close now, the barrel almost touching my chest."Nothing like what I felt for Mia.You have no idea.And now --"

He looks down at my hand and sees the napkin."What is that?A love note?"He looks at it.It reads You're cute.He smiles and crumples the paper and drops it to the floor in front of me.He cocks the gun and points it up again.One.___________________

I went back.I left Jason's unconscious body on the floor and I ran back to Kennedy High, and it was going on again.The soccer game.I don't have the napkin this time.I had to act on my own.I pulled Jason aside and I screamed to his face, right in the middle of the field, "DON'T YOU FUCKING EVER GO NEAR MIA AGAIN, DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?"Right in front of the kids.Right in front of my child self.The teachers came to see what the crying and the screaming was all about, and I ran away.I ran and I ran and I ran back to the house to find that neither myself, Jason, Alice or Mia lived there anymore.I found Mia and Jason living in a trailer park, and she had blonde hair and she smoked Camel cigarettes, and she said "Eric, woah.It's been a while.How've you been?"I went home to Alice and, the next day, we got a call from an old friend from Kennedy.Jason had killed his wife, Mia.We might remember her from school.The funeral was going to be tomorrow.I went back, and this time I pulled my own child self out of the goal, and I crouched by his side and I said, "Eric, I am you from the future.You have a Playboy magazine under your bed that Ethan gave to you and you secretly have a crush on Mia, though you think she doesn't like you very much.Listen to me..."

And I explained everything.When I went back home, Jason and Mia greeted me with surprise: "They let you out of the hospital, Eric?"They asked.Then they asked me if I was still taking my meds.I asked about Alice, but they said they never heard of an Alice.Jason called a number, and some guys wearing blue came and told me I had to go back to St. Peter's Asylum.The next day, I heard about Mia being murdered by her husband with a kitchen knife on the news.So I jumped out the window and I went back to Kennedy.To start all over again.______________________

I got it right, but it took me 10 attempts.Ten times I watched, read about, saw on the news -- Jason murdering Mia.Once, they were a rich celebrity couple.The other time she was a stripper, and dating me, and he showed up at her club with a baseball bat.Once he was a lawyer.Once a doctor.The fifth time I thought I had done it.Jason was in prison, and me and Mia were married, and Alice, I found out, worked at a drugstore, though she had never heard of me.I bought some gum from her.It was weird.Then, a week later, me and Mia, we were watching TV, and a guy came in with a hockey mask and he said, "This is from Jason", and I had to watch Mia get shot in the face again.The man walked away.Ten attempts until I realized that, no matter what I did, Jason would always kill Mia.That it wasn't about me, or Mia, or Alice.It was about Jason.About him being crazy.And Jason would be crazy, no matter the outcome of the events.But now she's safe.Jason won't bother her ever again.Don't ask me how I did it.Don't ask me if the change was intentional.Don't ask me if I meant to kill him.Please.Jason died.That's all that matters.Alice is an engineer, and, again, she's never heard of me.Mia and I are married.It's been six months.I never went back to Kennedy.I put the napkin back in the box and never looked at it again.Don't ask me how Jason died.Don't ask me if I did it on purpose.Pretend it was an accident.Please.Pretend I didn't mean to do it.That's what I do.It's been six months and Mia's making dinner now, and I'm watching TV.It's raining, and it's quiet, and I'm doing what I do every day now:

Drinking and trying to forget about what I did.Drinking and trying not to hate Mia and Jason and Alice and myself and napkins and the world in general.Drinking helps me pretend.If you need help pretending, drink.That's my advice.Drink because, apparently, you can be strong enough to kill a child and get away with it, but not strong enough to forgive yourself for what you've done, later.So you drink, because you have to live with it.And, when it gets really bad, you hit Mia.Sometimes.Then you drink more.And once you even stick the barrel of a Glock pistol in your mouth and you cry for ten minutes, but you don't shoot.Because you are a coward.So you keep drinking.Living the dream, day by day.I sigh, and I take another sip.And then I hear a knock.I get up from the couch and I head for the door and I open it.An old man is who's on the other side.I know his face.At least I think I do.He's holding a napkin."What happens?"I ask, and the old man is crying.He's holding on to the napkin so tight his hand is shaking.His hands, they look just like mine.He's wet from the rain."We kill her", he says, simply."We don't mean to.We just get a bit too drunk.Hit her a bit too much.She hits her head on the counter a bit too hard.She dies."I nod.Mia's voice reaches us from the kitchen."Dinner's ready, dear", she says, in a sweet, polite tone.She always says things like that, in that sweet tone.Trying not to trigger me.Not to piss me off.Not to cause her crazy drunk husband to go crazy drunk husband and hit her again.Sometimes it works.Sometimes it doesn't."How do we stop it?"I ask the old man.He smiles faintly.He's still crying."You tell me...", he says.I look at him, then back at my house.Then back at him."We saved her from Jason", he says."Can we save her from us?"I press my eyelids closed and take a deep breath.I open them again.The old man has his back to me.He's walking away in the rain.The napkin is on the floor, getting beaten to a wet pulp by the heavy drops of rain falling from the 
sky.I go back inside.Slowly, I make my way to the bedroom, going right past Mia.I open the bedroom door and I step inside.I open the closet.I take the box out and I open it.That's where I keep the napkin.That's also where I keep the Glock.

"And then I said 'Don't go in there, you idiot, there might be Tyrannosaurus eggs!Or 
something to that effect.""I wasn't even listening, I had stepped inside already."Rain pet Spielberg's head, nested 
between her legs."I wouldnt let this ugly thing go that easy."All around the fire, everyone laughed.Jackson, the new guy, leaned forward, hovering his stick of raw meat over the flames."And he was there?Spielberg?""Well, we were expecting to find Spielberg.Or, I don't know, dinosaurs.Not people!""Certainly not people with guns to our faces," Cro added, laughing too."Well, we weren't expecting to find a dude that looks like a caveman and a girl with no hand just browsing around!"Linda added."But I gotta tell you, it was a relief to find people after all these years.We thought we were alone in the world.We "

"Can we please change the subject?I've heard this story a thousand times in the last 
seven years," Roy grunted, from his spot in the dark."Jackson hadn't heard it before, Roy," Linda said."Don't be rude.""Yeah, yeah.They came, we almost shot them, we bonded, they've been living with us 
ever since.Can we drop it now?"Rain rolled her eyes.She *hated* Roy.For seven years, she had done a lot of things.Hunting, cooking, organizing and cleaning the bedrooms and the improvised living 
room but the thing she had done the most -- her all time favorite in this new phase of her life -- was hating Roy.He was an asshole, and, because he was there before everyone else, he thought he was 
the boss.Or maybe because he thought he was the boss and he was there before 
everyone else, he was an asshole.Or maybe because he was an asshole he thought he was the boss, and he  well, he sucked.That's the point.They were living on the top floor of the half-crumbled building over the garage.It was 
quite obvious, actually, once you thought about it.Dinosaurs are tall.Just find a place 
taller than them and you're ok.Rain and Cro had arrived, seven years before, to 
discover Roy, Linda, Sarah, Toby and Simpson on the darkness of the parking lot, guns to their faces.Misunderstandings and almost-getting-shot's apart, they were welcomed to the group.Even Spielberg, who Linda had only let stay on the condition that she would have priority petting access, even over Rain.Then came more.Thomas, Luke.Sabrina.And, most recently, Jackson.The last stand of 
the humans, living on top of an old commercial building.Waiting for another meteor so 
they could go back to living downstairs.Hopefully.Someday.All in all, this was a much better deal than Rain and Cro's first years in the jungle."Well, I had fun," Cro said, getting up."But I'm officially wasted.Gotta go to bed."He was halfway to the bedroom when Roy's voice called."What about the hunting?"Cro paused."What?""It's your turn.We're out of food."Cro looked around."We just ate, no one's going to need "

"There is a reason we have this system, Cro.The reason is it works.It worked long before you showed up.It's your turn to go find us food.So go find us food.""Come on, Roy, it's past midnight!He'll go tomorrow," Linda said."It takes hours to hunt something out there, Linda.You know that.Sometimes days.I, for one, don't want to wake up with no breakfast.And, last I checked, I was the one in charge, so"

"Come on, Roy, don't be a dick," Toby intervened."He'll go tomorrow, won't you, Cro?""Is this going to be a problem?"Roy said, menacingly."Because I --"

"It's fine," Cro said, stepping back towards them.He extended his hand to Roy."I'll go.""This is ridiculous!"Simpson added, shaking his head.Roy placed the pistol on Cro's hand, a smile creeping into his face."Sure you'll be back in no time, monkey-man."Rain felt the sudden urge to tie Roy up to a chair, call his mother and make her watch as 
she feasted on his eyeballs with a teaspoon.She got up."I'll go with you, Cro.""No, Rain, you "

"You can either say a bunch of prince charming I'll-protect-you shit and then find out I've 
followed you downstairs anyway or you can shut up and at least have company down the stairs."Cro sighed.Rain recognized the look in his eyes  the 'it's going to be no use arguing with this bitch' look."All right.But stay close to me at all times.""This is crazy!"Sarah said, getting up from his place around the fire."How are you 
guys going to see anything in the dark?"Cro turned back."We'lluh find a way.""Here," Simpson got up, offering the flashlight to Cro."Take it.Just... use it wisely.Not easy to come across batteries nowadays."Rain and Cro made way to the emergency exit that lead to the stairs.Spielberg rose to its feet with difficulty, marching its way to them."Hey, there," Cro said, crouching to the dinosaur."I think you're a bit too old for hunting, 
buddy.Why don't you stay while we "

"Let him come," Rain said, firmly."I can't take watching him locked inside this 
apartment for days in a row.I'll keep an eye on him."Spielberg seemed to understand what Rain was saying, and looked up hopeful at Cro.He jumped up and down, going for Cro's face.Cro sighed."All right.Let's go get some food."*Screech!*

Cro opened the door.Spielberg took off in front of them, disappearing in the darkness downstairs.__________________

"Noah!Noah!Are you packed!?"Uno watched the human.The kid's brain told him she was a good human.She was a 
protector.She was a mother.She was his mother.She was loved.She was a good human 
to the human Noah."Noah!""Yes, mom.""Are you packed?""I'll get right on it."He had to assemble the clothes.He put them together neatly in a bag, the bag the brain 
told him was the bag the kid used for school trips.His family  his father, Bea, Humphrey, Meredith  all were downstairs.They were going

 to Oregon.Oregon, USA.Uno was in Oregon too.He was in California and in Brazil and in Europe and in Australia but he was also in Oregon.Uno was 12.5% of Oregon right now, and expanding.They were going to enter the car and go to Oregon now, but the kid did not know the name of the city.The kid just knew the word "farmhouse" and the word "Granpa Jerry."He met the family downstairs.Meredith, Bea, Humphrey and the father and the mother of the kid."Is everyone ready?"the father said.The father was tall, and balding, and scared."All 
right, when we step outside, we don't talk to *anyone*.Do you understand that, Noah?""Yes," Uno said.The father pulled a pistol from his pants and cocked it, then put it back.Uno looked 
around at Noah's family.They were scared.&nbsp;



He was in the backseat of a station wagon, and they were heading north.They were 
heading to Oregon.Uno was 14.543% of Oregon by now, and it was growing.It would 
just grow faster, like expanding fractals.It was working well.The universe was so lonely.The universe was him, and he was the universe, and all things 
alive were him or became him at some point.He was everyone and everything.He was a 
software that expanded into the hardware of a million biological computers, neuron 
connections, brain tissue  power and storage for his ever-expanding self.He was the 
number of hosts he could find.He was all those things and he was just one thing all the same and the universe was so big and he was so small, he could expand but that just made him feel smaller, like the space, the endless space between particles.*We are made of that space.That space is so much bigger than the particles itself.The space is what makes matter.What makes us.*

*The universe is the loneliest place I know.*

He was the size of all the places he knew, but more kept coming.More galaxies to conquer.It never ended.Planets filled with life to take.Minds to invade, to dominate, 
to turn into him.Whole species that became just a fraction of what he was, of his 
search.His endless search, with no answer.No answer.Never an answer.The universe was the loneliest place he knew."We should get there before nightfall," Noah's father said, to the rest of the family."If 
we're lucky."They all nodded  Meredith, the mother, Bea, not the dog named Humphrey.Bea smiled at Uno.Uno smiled back.He unbuckled his seat belt, extended his finger and touched her forehead.Uno was Bea now, too._____

"I don't think this helmet will really take me to another universe," Greg said, right before putting the helmet on and being taken to another universe.The chair he was sitting on stared back at June in silence, apparently having nothing to contribute to the fact that a human being had just vanished in front of the both of them.June grabbed the second helmet from the floor and took the seat herself.The helmet was calibrated to the same random number they had put in for Greg, so, technically, she should end up at the same place he had just been shipped off to."All right," she said, staring straight ahead, the helmet safe between her hands, chest high."Let's do this."She took a deep breath.Somewhere out in the living room, Greg's dad rushed down the stairs, running from the fire he had started.June closed her eyes, counted to three and put the helmet on.&nbsp;



June opened her eyes.It was awfully hot around her.It was also awfully windy.The sky was burning with raging waves of fire and lava.She looked around.It was a desert, where she had just appeared.Gulfs of wind carried sand up into the air in mini tornadoes, and the fiery sky flashed with constant thunder and lightning.It was dark and eerie, and, in the distance, huge red mountains suggested themselves against the horizon all around.Overall a great place to shoot Mission to Mars 2."June!"June turned back.Greg was racing towards her, helmet still in his head."Where the fuck are we, June!?""Don't ask me!Your mother is the one who created the universe travelling shit!"Greg's eyes stopped on June's head, where her own helmet still rested.He looked down and found her eyes."How did you know about all this!?""My father discovered the Multiverse with your mother.They worked together at the UCLA quantum physics lab.He's the one who told me whenever people get sick in our reality, it means they died in another one.But he never told me there was a way to travel to other realities.That was all *your* mom.""Hey, don't blame my mom!"They had to scream over the wind and thunder to be heard.Greg stepped closer, and June smelled Paco Rabanne's One Million coming from his body.It felt weird."There must be some reason my mother told me about everyone getting sick!"Greg yelled into her ear."How could she know?""Greg, I think for now we should focus on the more important issue," June replied."The issue of figuring out what sort of place is this and how do we get out of "

"Hello, there."Greg and June turned back.A figure in a white suit and black bowtie stood a few inches from them, smiling kindly.It was a man.Tall, thin.Would look right at home dealing cards at the Bellagio."Who are you!?"Greg asked over the wind."My name is Jon Bon Jovi," the man said.June frowned."You are not Bon Jovi."The man smiled."I am not the Bon Jovi you know.But I *am* Jon Bon Jovi nonetheless.Do you understand?""Not even a little bit."Jon Bon Jovi stepped closer."Allow me to explain, because I take it from your faces that this is the first parallel universe you visit.""You got that right.""There are infinite universes.Which means that *every possible coincidence* is a mathematical certainty.Which means that pretty much everything that has even the slightest possibility of happening happens infinite times all across the Multiverse, all the time.Do you follow?""Yeah" June said slowly."Yeah, I think so, actually!""I have no idea what you two are talking about," Greg intervened."So this is a particular universe where only a small desert covered by a sky of fire exists.No sun, no moons, no nothing.And in that desert, only one humanoid creature lives, always wearing a suit and bowtie, and that creature knows all the secrets of the multiverse and is incredibly intelligent, even though it didn't evolve from natural selection.Also, that creature has the same name as a famous Hard Rock singer from a blue planet in another universe.That is me.""Sounds like an awful coincidence," Greg said, suspicious."I'm glad you understand," Jon Bon Jovi smiled."I didn't say that.""Shhh," June grunted.She turned to Jon."So you know all the secrets of the multiverse?""Yes.""Tell us why people in our reality are getting sick," June said."We are trying to find the universe in which they all died, because "

"Wait," Jon Bon Jovi looked from June to Greg."Are you Greg Marshall?"Greg's eyes widened like he was suddenly living on a prayer."Yes, why?"Jon Bon Jovi turned to June."So that'd make you June, from reality three seven nine eight two zero five three one seven eight zero zero "

"Yes, that's us!"June interrupted."How do you know?""Like I said, I know everything about everything, including the future.Oh, boy, it's an honor to meet you two!The crazy shit you guys pull, wow!"Jon Bon Jovi chuckled and looked down like he was thinking of a fond memory."But we don't know what to do," June continued."We don't even know what's going on.You gotta help us!"Jon Bon Jovi shrugged."Sorry, I can't.By another incredible act of coincidence of the Multiverse, I also happen to believe in a very specific religion which forbids me from sharing the secrets of the Multiverse with anyone.According to my faith, disobeying this rule would result in me turning into a sassy cucumber.""Shit."Jon Bon Jovi, Greg and June stared at each other in silence against the howling wind for a while.Finally, Jon said, "All right, I *will* tell you where to go next.But that's all.If I turn into a cucumber as a result of this, it's on you.""Great!"Greg stepped forward."Can you work this helmet?"Jon Bon Jovi squinted as he studied the helmet on Greg's head."Yeah, yeah.Pretty standard device.I'll send you to a reality where you can find some answers."He inputted the numbers on Greg's helmet, then walked over to June and worked hers.Finally, he stepped away and put his hands behind his back, smiling.His suit flapped in 
the wind, and his hair was a bit covered in sand."Greg Marshall and June boy, are you kids in for a ride."Greg and June exchanged looks.June raised her hand to the activate button on her helmet, and Greg did the same."And remember," Jon Bon Jovi said, as they were about to press."It's your life, kids.It's now or never.You ain't gonna live forever."June pressed the button and everything went dark._______________

*The experiment was allegedly based on an aspect of unified field theory; according to some accounts, unspecified "researchers" thought that some version of this field would enable using large electrical generators to bend light around an object via refraction, so that the object became completely invisible.The Navy regarded this of military value and, by the same accounts, it sponsored the experiment.*

I rise my eyes from the paper, feeling lost like a prostitute's son on Father's day."What is this?""This is the Wikipedia entry for the Philadelphia Experiment", the old-man-now-young replies."Not that there is a Wikipedia yet, in the world.But there will be.Let's not get into the semantics of time travel, though.""What -- I --"

"Look, they tried to make a ship invisible, ok?"The man tells me."But it went awry.The ship actually disappeared.It showed up in Norfolk, Virginia.And the crew... well they showed up weird."I look down at the paper again and I keep reading.*Some crew members were said to have been physically fused to the bulkheads, while others suffered mental disorders, some re-materialized inside out, and other still supposedly vanished.*

"This is *true*?"I ask."Sounds like something I'd read out of a Snopes page.""What?That's the part you have trouble believing?"The man asks."You're sitting in a park bench with a rejuvenated old man in 1986 New York, son."*He has a point*, I think, looking around.We're in a park bench, resting in the shade of the WTC South Tower.All around us, people go about their business right and left; suited men with no cell phones to their ear; kids wearing long hair and leather bracelets and Aerosmith and Sex Pistols shirts; no iPads or gadgets on outside tables of cafs and a lot less Starbucks around.I see a crazy bum screaming nonsense in the corner (because some things never change)."They did something, that morning in Philadelphia.They messed with things they shouldn't have.They woke something powerful.Something they couldn't comprehend.""Are we expecting Cthulhu anytime soon?"I ask.(I use humor as a defense mechanism when I'm terrified.It's why I suck on first dates.)"This is serious, son", the man replies."Weird things have been happening ever since the Eldridge.Roswell.Area 51.JFK.""What's weird about JFK?""Well, he didn't die.Not the first time around."I look at him like *what?*

"I remember the shot missed him, and the guards caught Oswald.A couple months later I woke up and it was November 22 all over again.Same day.My wife said the same things to me at breakfast, and my coworkers made the same lame jokes.It was like Groundhog day, except at 12:30 pm, in Dallas, Lee Harvey Oswald didn't miss the shot, and JFK died.From then on, the next couple of months were quite different.That's the story as you know it.That's what everyone remembers."I blink repeatedly, trying to make sense of his words.I notice two men in trench coats standing by a corner on the other end of the park, staring at us, then back at their wristwatches in perfect sync, like they're NPC characters in a shitty RPG Maker game.I wonder if I'm going a bit too paranoid."So... What?Things are changing all the time?""Well, 'time' is tricky word to use here, but yes... To sum it up, ever since Philadelphia, the linear progression of time in our world has experienced some... *jumps*, if you will.Sometimes it's minutes long.Sometimes hours.Sometimes years.And sooner or later after it, something changes.And I'm the only one who remembers it."I rub my eyes.I look at the man.He lights a cigarette."How do you know all this?I mean... Why are you...no one else remembers JFK *not* being murdered."The man looks at me, cigarette resting between his fingers and on his lips.He pulls it and speaks through thick, white smoke."Because whenever there's a jump, I jump with it.If I'm in a car, I bring everyone with me.In a bus, ditto.Or on a plane."He pauses."Though no one seems to remember anything, except for me.Well, and you, now."This is all too insane.I would rise and get up and tell him to fuck himself right now, if what he was saying was more insane than the clearly 1986 New York landscape around me.But it's not.It's about the same amount of insane.So I might as well listen to him."Who's doing this?"I ask."Who is making the changes?Why haven't *I* aged?Why did it look like the flight attendant knew about this?And the old lady scribbling on the plane?The boy that turned into a girl?"I feel like I'm living the plot of J.J. Abrams' new TV Show.I *hate* J.J. Abrams."Those are questions I cannot help you with", the man tells me, getting up."I have learned not to question these things a long time ago.I advise you to do the same."He starts walking away.I get up."Wait.How do you know all this?About the Eldridge ship on Philadelphia and everything?"He turns back.He pulls the cigarette from his mouth."Because I was there, Psycho Alpaca.I was on that ship."He turns around and keeps walking.With his back to me, he screams, in the distance:

"If you miss home, I suggest visiting the 77th Subway Station.Lovely there, this time of year."I look back at the other end of the park.The two men in trench coats are gone._____________________



Listen.I'm at 77th right now.This is where I'm posting this from.There's a hotspot here, don't ask me how that's even possible.I'm beginning to understand what the old-young man meant by *Don't question these things.*

*Memories from the Future*, that's the name of the network.No password required.I'm trying to trace it to a source, see if I can find who the hell the connection belongs to.I'll try to post more updates later.Wish me luck._______________

Michael set the controls for automatic landing  he was never good at parking.He sat back and closed his eyes, calmly finishing his drink as he waited for the familiar bump of the ship hitting ground."Michael," came Zara's delicate voice from the speakers, after a few minutes."We've landed.""Thank you, Z," Michael said to the onboard computer."What's the status outside?""A barren, arid land.We're currently on a territory that was formerly known as Arizona.""United States," Michael said, thoughtfully.He checked his backpack one more time to make sure he had all the supplies.Then he went for the box where he kept his .45."Michael are you sure you don't want to take something more powerful?"Zara's voice  came, careful.Michael smiled.His gun was one of the many things Zara disapproved about him.While almost all other agents used high caliber, high precision laser muskets, Michael had always carried with him a .45, an exact replica of the model that was once popular on Earth, back when Earth was, well Earth.His great, great, great grandfather had been a cop in Los Angeles, and he had lived and died defending his people with a .45.When Michael decided he was going to join the Special Forces and serve humanity, he also decided he would do it with the same weapon his grandfather used."I'm fine, Zara.But thank you for your concern.""You are going alone to hostile territory.The last known human to have landed here has no known whereabouts and was last seen being attacked by an unidentified force and is presumed dead.And you're carrying a gun from the Stone Age."Michael threw the backpack over his shoulders, cocked and uncocked the gun's hammer to make sure it was working, spun it twice around his fingers Clint Eastwood style and holstered it.He headed for the door and, before it had opened enough to let him out, said: "I'll be fine, Zara.Even with a Stone Age pistol, I'm still the one they call when shit hits the fan."And, like an angry girlfriend with no more arguments but still unwilling to admit defeat, Zara said nothing.&nbsp;

The sun blinded Michael the second he stepped out of the ship.His feet hit sand with a crunchy noise, and he raised his hand over his eyes, squinting.The landscape around him was arid and barren like Zara had predicted, all right.It was also scalding hot all over.There was no sign that humanity had ever been there  or any living creature ever, for that matter.But then again, Michael thought, lots of places on Earth were unexplored 
and wild, even when humans lived there.So this was probably not that unusual.Michael pulled his Pad and checked the navigator.He was five miles from Nova's last known position.There was also a message alert from base blinking in a red dot, begging to be played.Michael clicked it.His wife's voice came alive from the speaker:

&nbsp;

*Miss you, Mike.Sorry, can't wait around for your response  I've got three security guys surrounding me as I speak.Apparently, they don't usually let agent's wife into the communication and control room to tell them they love them.How very rude.Anyway, please come home safe.Love you.*

&nbsp;

The voice feed was cut.A second later, it blasted again:

&nbsp;

*Also, if you're only packing that old metal toy for a gun, I will cut off your balls in your sleep when you come back.Please, for the love of God, carry a real gun, at least on this mission, you big macho idiot.Love you.*

&nbsp;

Michael allowed himself a smile, then stuffed the pad back in his pocket.He raised his eyes to the direction the navigator had pointed him to.The horizon seemed to wave like a mirage in the distant heat.It made Michael think of old Wild West movies people watched back on Old Earth.He sighed, took the first step towards Nova's location and stopped.Someone had giggled.Just behind him.He ripped his pistol from the holster and turned around in a quick motion, gun pointed in front of his chest.At first, it looked like there was no one there.Then he saw it: behind his ship, half the face hidden behind the turbine, a little boy watched his movement with curious eyes, face covered in dirt.Michael frowned, and the boy pulled away, disappearing behind the ship, giggling away like they were playing hide and seek._____

Rain opened her eyes.It was raining.She could hear the *pluck, pluck, pluck* over her 
tent like a thousand little bugs singing happy birthday in Morse code."Are you up already?"Cro's voice rang from the outside."I'm trying to cook us 
breakfast.""It's raining, Cro," Rain replied, pushing the tent curtain aside."You're not gonna to be 
able to "

Cro turned a smile at her.He was crouched by a large tree, a pile of woods burning and 
cracking and smoking between his knees."I'm a God damned caveman, woman.Show 
some respect."Rain chuckled, pulling back inside the tent.Six years.Six years had passed since she met Cro.Since her parents died.Since the 
world went to shit.Six years since the dinosaurs and the crisis and the people bombing 
each other  I mean, whose idea was it to freaking bomb cities as a solution, anyway?Who do you think is more likely to survive a blast, a person or something called 
Giganotosaurus?Six years and the world was pretty much green and brown.From vine wrapped buildings 
in the big cities  which Cro and Rain stayed away from, as much as they could  to the 
woods where they were setting camp now.Green and brown.Well, the woods had always been green and brown, so that really didn't change.Just 
everything around.Everything touched by humanity, each building-crumble closer to its original form.One patch of overgrown grass sprouting from sidewalk cracks at a 
time, the world was healing from Men.Returning to green and brown and quiet.As for Rain and Cro?Their plan?The great big quest in the wasteland?Staying alive.And, given that Cro had literally been designed by millions of years of 
evolution to survive a world very similar to this, it was going rather well.Rain, on the other hand, had a couple thousand years of evolution in the direction of 
knowing exactly how long to linger on a channel before switching to the next one.It was 
hard coded in her DNA, the ability to text with one hand while browsing the internet on 
her laptop with the other.She had perfect instincts when it came to finding the best 
price in online-shopping.So, yeah.It was fair to say that Cro was the main responsible for keeping them alive.But she *had* learned things."What are we having?"Rain sprouted from the tent again, approaching Cro."Is it eggs 
again?I can't take "

Cro looked up suddenly, startled.Rain heard the noise too.Rain's eyes followed.The velociraptor was standing perfectly still on its back legs, its long smile tilted 
sideways.Watching.It took a step forward.Rain kept her eyes on the animal.It took another step.She could hear its breath.It took another step.And another.The animal stopped in front of Rain, its thin pupils rising up to her face.Rain bent down 
to her knees, keeping eye contact.The animal tilted its head the opposite way."Who's a good boy?"Rain said, brushing her hand past the chicken-sized, feathered 
dinosaur."That's right, you are, Spielberg.You're a good boy, aren't you?"The animal rubbed its head against Rain's hand for a bit, then stepped closer to Cro, its 
face almost asking 'Whatcha cooking there, modafoka?'"Hang on, I got something for you."Cro fished a large piece of raw meat from his 
battered backpack and threw it in the air.Spielberg caught it and ran to his corner.Cro grabbed a second piece and bit onto it with pleasure."Oh, God, that's gross," Rain said, sitting by the fire."Sorry, old habits and all" Cro stirred the eggs on the pan."What's in the schedule for 
today?""Don't know," Rain replied."Wanna play some catch?I still have the baseball.""Meh I think maybe "

They both looked up at the same time.The thud.This wasn't the first, or second, or 
hundredth time they had heard it.But it was by far the loudest.It usually was that they'd hear it  or feel the ground shaking  and immediately seek 
cover.They're run whichever way sounded like the opposite of the sound until they found a place to hide.And waited.But it was never as loud as this time.Loud enough that Rain couldn't even tell where it 
was coming from."We better get out of here," Cro said, getting up and killing the fire with feet stomps."Leave the tent, we can pick it up later.Just grab your backpack."Rain turned around to face the tent, but it wasn't there.What *was* there was a flaky feet the size of five Rains.Her eyes climbed up the insanely large body in slow motion.The T-Rex was wearing the tent like a sleeping mask, moving its head from side to side, 
trying to get rid of it.With the corner of her eyes, Rain saw Cro stepping by her side.The tent fell from the beast's face, and its eyes stopped on the couple of humans in front of it."Don't move a muscle," Rain whispered to Cro."They can't see you if you don't move.""Are you sure?"Cro hushed back."That doesn't sound right at all.Where did you hear 
that?""Jurassic Park."The animal lowered its head.A curious look in its Mother-of-God scary eyes, it sniffed 
between Cro and Rain.Its breath smelled like dying in pain."What's a Jurassic Park?""It's a movie.""ARE YOU SHITTING "

"Shhh!"The T-Rex recoiled, startled by Cro's yell.Rain swallowed dry, her breath a staccato of 
shallow attempts at air.The T-Rex raised its to full position, slowly, eyes still on Rain and Cro.It looked around for a bit, then raised its back legs for a step in the opposite direction.Rain was about to cry in relief when 

*Screech.*

It wasn't scary.Not a high-pitched note.It was cute like 'Hey, bro.'Spielberg.Looking up at T-Rex.And again.*Screech.*

The T-Rex stopped, turned its head down to face the mini-version of him.*Screech, screech.*

"Spielberg," Rain hushed."Over here."The animal looked at Rain, then back at the T-Rex.By Rain's side, Cro begun to move."No, Cro."She tried holding him by the shirt, but he pulled away.In slow steps, he approached 
Spielberg as the T-Rex's head bent down to scrutinize its prey.*Screech.*

"Come here, boy," Cro whispered, arms opened to catch Spielberg."Come here, come "

Rain saw it a second before it happened.Cro's feet went under an exposed root and, when he raised it for the next step, he tripped.The sound of his fall was like a Death Metal concert, given the circumstance.The T-Rex turned its head, fast now.Cro recoiled, and Spielberg raced to Rain's side.The Rex stood perfectly still for a second.Then it raised its head up in the air and 
screamed "MOTHERFUCKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!"Or at least that's what Rain assumed it meant, before the three of them started running.______________

Cro closed his eyes, trying to recapture the sleep.His mind 
wandered eight years to the past, to the day they they running 
from the T-Rex.A flash of Rain's arm stretching back to pull him 
up danced in front of his eyes.A flash of a gigantic jaw closing in 
on her wrist.A scream of pain."Are you sleeping?"he heard Rain's voice, somewhere to his right."Trying to.""Come on, Cro.It's morning already.You said we would keep looking."Cro sighed.He turned around.Rain was sitting with her legs 
crossed by his side, a look of expectation in her eyes."He's gone, 
Rain.It's been three days.""He's not gone!He probably went hunting and got lost.""We've searched the woods for hours, he "

"So we need to search the city.Santa Clarita is only a few miles 
away.He probably wandered there, he wouldn't get lost in these 
woods."Cro sat up.His eyes stopped on the stump where Rain's wrist 
ended in a wrap of scar-tissue."You know we can't go near the cities.That's where they lay their eggs.""Just this one time.If we don't find Spielberg, I swear I won't 
complain."Cro sighed.&nbsp;

"What are you thinking about?"Rain asked, as they made way 
through the sunlit dirt path that lead into the outskirts of Santa 
Clarita."I was thinking about how you got the name 'Rain'.""Really?""No.But now that I mentioned it, how did you?"Rain smiled."My parents were hippies.""What's a hippie?""You don't know?""I spent the best part of the twentieth century pretending to be a 
statue."Rain thought for a second."It was a group of guys who were kind 
of like you.Except they had more hair.And smelled worse."Cro nodded.After a while, the path started giving way to what appeared to 
have been a highway once, fourteen years ago.Skeleton cars 
tumbled over faded stripes of lane-divide scattered their way for a 
couple of feet into a wide corridor of broken down houses up 
ahead.Inside a rusty Corolla with no roof, Cro saw eggs.The size of 
basketballs."Come on, Cro!"Rain was already up ahead."We gotta keep looking."Cro followed.&nbsp;

"Spielberg!Spielberg!""Go ahead, scream louder.I think there's a Megalosaurus in 
Australia that didn't hear you.""Spielberg!"Rain's voice echoed through the streets and came back to them in 
faded repetitions.Nothing.No sound.No life.Not even those little 
ones Cro learned at the museum were called Compsognathus."Spielberg!Spielberg!"All around it was like someone tried to build a city out of Lego and 
gave up halfway through.Houses with no roof or walls.Couches 
and TVs tumbled over the cracked sidewalks.Building structures 
exposed.Vine everywhere.Cro felt something on his shoulder.He turned back, startled, to 
find a 

"GET IT OFF ME!GET IT OFF ME!"Cro ran in circles, slapping his back repeatedly, jumping up and 
down."What is it?Oh."Rain laughed."You're afraid of them?""GET IF OFF GET IF OFF!"Rain dusted his back, and the Meganeura flew away, circling Cro's 
head a couple of times before disappearing upwards."It's just a giant dragon-fly, it doesn't sting or anything!""I don't like car-sized bugs."Cro enunciated, his heart still 
racing."I don't think that's unreasonable.""You're the dandiest caveman I've ever seen, Cro.""Fucking thing could eat my head in a single bite, if it "

*Screech.*

Cro turned around.Rain looked too.*Screech.*

It was coming from an underground parking lot.The building over it was 
half-destroyed, and the gate was broken.Inside, all Cro could see was darkness.*Screech.*

"He's there!"Rain said, stepping forward."Come on!""We don't know that it's him," Cro argued, but he followed.*Screech.*

"I know his screech," Rain said, confident.They stopped at the edge of the darkness by the garage entrance.The sound of dripping water reached them.A warm lick of air bathed Cro's face, coming from the inside.*Warm.Humid.Perfect for nesting.*

"You know there might be some freaking Tyrannosaurs eggs in 
there, so why don't we "

But Rain had disappeared into the darkness already._______________

"Jim, this is crazy!"Jim turned back to face Karen.*Damn, her eyes were beautiful.* "You don't understand.I have to do this.""Why!?"Jim looked down at his phone, and, a second later, heard the honk.The Uber arrived.He looked from the car to Karen."Look, I don't have time to explain.Just wait for me, okay?Im gonna make everything right!""Jim, don't leave!"It hurt Jim to leave her there, pleading eyes, beautiful evening dress, alone by the sidewalk.But he had to fix this.He had to.Karen liked him.Karen Willow actually liked him!It was just a matter of fixing the whole universe now and they could be together."I'll be back!"Jim screamed, banging the car door.He turned to face the driver."All right, let's go.""You didn't put a destination, sir," came a manly voice from behind the seat's backrest."Oh right," Jim said."Huh... Elon Musk's house."The driver turned back to face Jim."Excuse me?""Elon Musk.You know, the billionaire.""You wanna go to Elon Musk's house."Jim smiled."Yeah.I'm his son.Alon.Busk.""Alon Busk.""Yes.""You're his son and you don't have his last name."*Shit* Jim thought, annoyed at himself.He made a mental note to fix the code responsible for his intelligence once he had a chance."Look, sir, can you just get me to "

"Son, I got another passenger to pick up.""Fine.Fine.Pick them up, I'll get out wherever you stop," Jim said.At this point he just 
wanted the driver to take him away from Karen's sad eyes, still locked on him through the car window.The driver shrugged and started the car.Jim leaned back and watched the streets of LA rolling out the window, the golden sunset falling on top of the busy sidewalks and cars.*None of it was real everything was a simulation.*

Jim considered that, but he concluded that he didn't mind.As long as he found a way to 
debug the system so that things didn't lag anymore  and especially so that he would *forget* that the world is a simulation  it would be okay.As long as you don't know a lie is a lie, a lie isn't a lie, right?And Karen Willow loved him.Screw reality!Karen Willow was all that mattered right now.He was gonna find Elon, and he was going to convince him that the whole plan was 
crazy, and together they were going to fix the simulated universe, and Jim would go back to finish his date with the 3rd sexiest woman alive.Yes, that was the plan.*Why the hell would a person want to destroy a simulated universe where they are a billionaire, anyway?* Elon Musk was a weird fella.Finally the Uber pulled to a stop near Sepulveda Boulevard."All right, this is it."Jim looked up, brought back to reality by the sudden jolt of the car.He thought about his options: he could always Google Elon Musk's address and get another Uber.But he had a feeling the guy was probably not easy to reach.Most successful people aren't.(You know, expect for celebrities who run you over with their Bentleys then ask you out on dates.)"Huh" Jim said, trying to gain time.*What do I do?What do I do?What do I --*

The passenger door came open in a sudden movement, and a green-haired girl with a cigarette dangling from her lips practically threw herself in, slamming the door behind her."Hey!Drive, now!Elon Musk's address!"Jim's eyes widened.The girl flipped open an old nokia cell phone and pressed a speed 
dial button.A second later, a muffled voice came through the speaker."Hey, Brad!?It's me, Annie.Don't worry, I got this shit under control.Yes, I'll be back in 
time, honey.You just relax.Watch Fight Club again or something.""Excuse me," Jim started."Not now, dude, I got a simulated reality to fix!"the girl barked back, lighting her cigarette.The driver looked from the girl to Jim, then shrugged, turned on the stereo and took off._______

Hitler was having a piece of banana cake when Bob Ross walked in."And I just feel like no one *gets* me, you know?"The future Fuhrer was saying to one of his servants, as he 
sprayed whipped cream over the cake, distracted."I mean, I know most artists are destined to be posthumous, 
but I don't know, I guess I want the fame and the fortune too, you know?""*Ja*, It is very hard, my master," the man said, in a German accent but in English for no reason at all, just like foreign characters in the movies."Hey, Hitler," Bob said, stepping in, confident."May I?"he pulled a chair sat down without waiting for an answer."What is this!?""Listen, I'm Bob Ross and I'm from the future and I paint stuff.""Bob Ross?""Yes.Here's the thing  I'm supposed to come here and teach you how to paint so you'll be a good painter and not 
invade Poland and then the rest of Europe and cause the death of millions of people.""Holy shit, I do that!?"Hitler widened his eyes."Oh, yes.It's awful.People still use your name as a reference to evil.There's even an internet law based on how 
long it takes until someone compares a certain situation to Nazi German during an argument.""What's the internet?""Never mind," Bob leaned forward."This is what we're going to do  I'm going to teach you how to "

"Excuse me," Hitler's servant said, in that same fake accent."I'm afraid I must intervene here.""What's wrong?""Well, Mr. Ross, have you considered the twist?""The twist?""Yes.The fact that you'll teach this man how to paint, he'll grow to be a famous painter, not invade anything, and 
when you return to your home time you'll find out that another man named, I don't know, Hans, has taken over 
Germany and did worse things than Adolf here could ever do."Ross frowned."I don't follow.""You don't watch much Twilight Zone, do you?"The servant asked."How do you know about Twilight Zone?This is 1910.""Never mind about that."The servant leaned back."My name is Hans, Ross.And I will take over Germany if you 
teach Adolf how to paint.""Why!?Why would you do that?""Why else would I be in the scene?Why would Hitler not be alone when you walked in?I have to serve some 
purpose for the plot, right?And let's face it  go back in time and kill/talk/convince/teach Hitler is a trope we've 
seen before, and it always ends like this.In fact, most time traveling tropes tend to end with a silly variation of the butterfly effect we-made-things-even-worse twist.Let's not make this prompt another example."Bob Ross scratched his head and thought about this."Shit.Okay.I guess.But what do we do now?""Now we find a way to subvert time traveling tropes and present something fresh for the readers.And fast, because they're getting impatient.""Why are they getting impatient?We're still at 500 words!""Yes, but we've gone post-modern self-referential, characters-acknowledging-their-own-stories.That annoys some 
people.""It's not really my fault, look at the prompt.Where do you go with time traveling Bob Ross and Hitler that's not 
self-referential parody?""Now you're blaming the OP for your shortcomings as a storyteller.Classy.""Not *my* shortcomings.I'm not the author."They both turn and stare at me for a second.I shrug."Anyway," Hans said, resuming the conversation."Do something different.Fast.""But what?""Huuuuuuh.Fuck, I don't know.Kiss Hitler!""Erotic Nazi Fanfic?No thanks.""Okay, then you have cancer, and Hitler nurses you to health, but in the end we find out *Hitler* has cancer too, and "

"I'm not taking part in The Fault in our Stars Feat.Adolf Hitler.It ain't gonna happen.""Well, you gotta do something, and fast, because time is running out.""Hitler?Any suggestions?"Adolf looked around.He got up and paced."I don't know.Can you just return to your present time and call it a 
day?""And then everything happens as it's supposed to?That's boring.""Yeah" Hitler stopped."I don't know then.I really don't know."Hans shook his head."Okay, I got this."He grabbed a little radio device from his pocket and spoke into it."Send them in."Ross frowned."Send who in?"Static emerged from the radio for a second, then a voice answered: "Copy that.""Send who in?"Adolf repeated."What's happening?""Well," Hans said, getting up."If we're in a Hitler and Bob Ross time traveling prompt and we can't figure out a way 
to turn in into something fresh, we might as well embrace irony and self-mockery to the full extend of Writing 
Prompt's classic tropes.""What do you mean?"The door came open behind Ross.He turned back and watched as two teenagers walked in  a boy in round 
glasses and a scar on his forehead and a girl that looked a lot like Emma Watson."Hey Harry, hey Hermione.Sorry to drag you into yet another prompt.You got the time turner?""Yup," Harry said, in a bored tone."Harry Potter fanfic?Really?"Ross shook his head."For fuck's sake.""If we're gonna go down the rabbit's hole, let's do it proudly."Hermione started setting the time turned.Harry looked around, curious.Ross sighed."Fuck that, I'm out," Hitler said, and then he jumped out the window, and then WW II didn't happen, but the 
Statute of Secrecy *was* violated on account of the whole thing and muggles learned about magic and when Ross returned to his present day no one gave a shit about static paintings anymore, so he died a poor man, which I guess is irony or whatever, I don't even care.

Ok. Ok. We need to chill here.Be cool.Let's get started.I didn't trace the connection.The one on the subway station.On 77th.I tried, but I couldn't trace it.It traced me, though.I'll explain:

I slept on the subway tonight.Well, I tried.Got about as much sleep as you'd imagine 
someone who just traveled back in time by accident would get, which is not much, I 
assure you.I slept there because I didn't want to stay away from the hotspot.I'm terrified of losing the connection to my home time.So I slept to the wooshing sound of trains coming and going and New Yorkers complaining about Ronald Reagan.I woke up an hour ago.Hour and a half.I'm not really sure.It was deserted, the station, when I woke up.Have you ever seen a deserted subway station in 1986 New York?It's terrifying.Really, 
really creepy the way you think of horror stories and stuff creepy.But to the matter at hand.I woke up and I checked reddit, and oh boy were there a lot 
of notifications.Thank you for the kind words and for the support, everyone, I'll try to 
get through all the messages fast as I can.I didn't really have enough time, then.I did, however, had to make time to answer one particular message, which was a PM, 
which I noticed in my inbox with the title "Memories from the Future".That PM almost 
made me soil myself, I have no shame in admitting.(I did soil myself today, and I'll get to that in a moment.It wasn't just yet).Here is what the PM said:
______________

**from [UNDISCLOSED] sent 1 hour ago**

Count to ten, then look to your right.A little gray mouse is going to pass by, sniff around 
under the Brooklyn subway map and disappear down the tunnel.(Stay on 77th.We are coming.)____________________

And those ten seconds were the last ten seconds I remember not freaking out.Yes, it's been an hour and I'm still freaking out, that's what I'm saying.Because the rat 
was there, and it did all those things it said on the PM.It sniffed and it disappeared down 
the tunnel, exactly like the message said it would.Yes, the rat was there.Who wasn't there, for that matter, was me.I replied the 
message with a polite *WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU AND WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON* and got up, heading for the exit, laptop open in my arms as I walked.An answer came before I could go far, though, and it read like this:

___________________

**from [UNDISCLOSED] sent 1 hour ago**

Stop running and sit on the floor.Now._____________________

And I did.I don't know why, but there was something in that message that made me 
think that if I didn't do it, something awful would happen.Maybe it would.We'll never 
know, because I sat.I stopped and I sat and where I was now was a long tubular corridor of "Red, White and 
You" Coke Ads, graffiti and faded red tiles.It was deserted, and even more freaky than 
the actual station where the trains come and go I was sleeping at.And then, new message:

Youtube.First recommendation.________________________

I did what it said.I opened Youtube, and the first recommendation video was entitled 
Psycho Alpaca.There's really no way for me to actually described faithfully what happened then so you 
can feel exactly like I felt, but I'll try.Here we go:

The video opened on the face of an old man with a scar on his forehead.This wasn't the 
plane old man.I've never seen this old man in my life.He was a new old man.Behind him were people working on computers and reading things and passing by here 
and there.The scenery and the technology was definitely 2015, not 1986.It looked like a 
lab of some sort.The twin trench coat NPC dudes passed in the background, rushing left to right off focus 
behind the old man's face.The old man smiled, and then he begun talking."Psycho, I know this is confusing.I need you to listen to me.What you experienced 
yesterday was a time jump.It is something intentional, not an accident.Something we 
have been working on for quite a while.""What the fuck do you mean by *we*?"I screamed to the computer, feeling like an 
insane person, because I knew fully well it wasn't going to answer back.Then it answered back."Please calm down, Psycho.Everything will be explained in no time."(This was the part where I soiled myself, if you were keeping tabs).My voice trembled as I answered."You can hear me?""Yes, I can.What you need to understand is that these changes we are making, they are 
for the best.We are working for the benefit of mankind, not the other way around.The 
man you met today, on the plane, he works with us.He was advised not to tell you 
anything, though.To pretend he didn't know what was going on.We felt it would be 
better for you to be brought up to speed by a familiar face.""You?"I asked my computer screen.The man's face was not familiar to me at all."Please be patient.Everything will be explained in time.What I need you to do now, 
Psycho, is please look to your right."So I did that.I looked to my right.Standing on the far end of the dark tunnel was a tall figure shadowed by shadow.(I realize this is a shitty way to say someone was obscured by darkness, but to hell with 
it, I just traveled in time, I have no time for fancy descriptions.)(I also realize I used the word 'time' twice in the same sentence and that it read weird, 
but I won't change it for the reasons aforementioned).Anyway, the silhouette was standing there, freaking the bejesus out of me.Then it took a step forward and I could see its face.And it was the old man with the 
scar.The one in the Youtube video.He extended his hand.On the laptop screen, he said: "Please come with me."So, naturally, I ran on the opposite direction.He didn't go after me, far as I could tell.Granted, I only looked back once before making 
a turn and disappearing from his sight, but what I saw was him just standing there, hand still extended in silence, as if waiting for me to change my mind.I didn't.I ran out of there and into the streets and what felt like the whole extension of 
Manhattan island.Then, when I felt like I couldn't run another second, I stopped.I looked around, hands resting on my bended knees, trying to get a sense of where I was.Where I was looked like a dark, deserted street.I spotted a bus stop next to me, and I made way towards it.I noticed someone sitting on the bench but, from behind, all I could tell was that it was a female.I made way around to the front and I stopped.The figure sitting on the bench was the flight attendant lady.(the one that told me to shut up, back on the plane).She looked up from a book on her lap to me.For a second, she didn't do anything.We just stood there, facing each other.Then she turned her book my way, and I could read what she was reading.Scribbled in pen over the words printed on the pages of the book were three letters.*RUN.*

I looked from the book to her, feeling all the hair in my body rising like powdered iron 
exposed to a magnet.I whispered, under my breath:

"What?"Then she opened her mouth and started screaming insanely.She didn't move a single other muscle on her face.Her eyes didn't wrinkle, her forehead didn't frown.She just opened her mouth and screamed the loudest scream I had ever heard.High pitched scream.Non-human sounding scream.So I ran again.And I feel like I'm running out of places to run to.___________________________________


All right, I finished typing this.Where I am now is on a back alley close to the 77th 
station.I got a NY Yankees blue cap and something I improvised as a scarf I found lying around behind a dumpster.I look like a disguised celebrity.I'm going to try and walk past 77th unrecognized, fast as I can.Get close enough so I can at least post this up on reddit.If you're reading this, then I did it.Yay me.I'll try to post more updates as soon as I can, but I don't know how long it's going to be before I feel comfortable getting close to the station again.If you're not reading this, then they probably caught me, and it makes no difference 
what I type here because no one will read it anyway, so Big Giraffe Orgy._________________________

Michael made way around the ship, the .45 aiming steadily ahead.He dragged his feet sideways slowly, eyes fixed on the spot the boy's face had appeared."Kid?"he tried, careful."Step out now.I'm not gonna hurt you."*I mean, unless you try to hurt me first*

In three fast steps, Michael turned the corner of the ship and raised his gun to

No one.The kid was gone.Michael turned back, made way around the ship again, even looked under the turbines.Nothing.The kid had vanished.And there was *nowhere* he could have gone.They were in an open field as far as the freaking eyes could see.Gun still in hand, Michael leaned against the ship, considering what had just happened.Should he just continue the original mission and follow the navigator toward Nova's landing spot?Should he report what had just happened?What would he even report?*There was a kid here who giggled at me then vanished into thin air.Seriously.I'm totally not crazy.Please don't take my badge away.*

He looked down and considered stepping into the ship and making himself a second drink.It was air-conditioner cool inside, there was a place to sit, think things over away from the heat he could 

Michael stopped.He had just caught something moving on his peripheral vision, just to his right.His soldier instinct made him stay still, as opposed to reacting with sudden movement when faced with an unexpected presence.He kept his eye on the patch of sand directly in front of him and didn't move a muscle.The thing moved again, near his right foot.Slow and calm, he turned his eyes towards the movement, keeping his head perfectly still.It was a little green beast.After noticing its size and apparent harmlessness, Michael allowed himself to step out of 'stealth-mode' and turn his head.The animal was about as tall as his ankles, and less than two feet long.It had a flat head with little horns sprouting out from behind black eyes, four thin legs, a tail and scales all over its body.It took three confident steps towards Michael's foot, then two scared ones back as Michael turned."You're an ugly asshole," Michael said crouching to look at the animal closer.Its mouth was wide; a semi-circle drawn across its face like it was permanently smiling.Michael reached out his hand to try and grab 

The animal turned back and fired off in a hurry, disappearing under the ship and leaving a little cloud of dirt behind.Michael got up and turned back to face the desert.Then he turned his eyes down again.*What the hell?*

Crouching back, he studied the ground where the animal had just been.There was something under the sand.Frowning, Michael dusted the spot with his hand.Something solid.Cold.As Michael kept dusting, a metal hatch revealed itself under the dirt.He uncovered a handle and pulled.The thing came open easily, giving way for a whiff of cold, stale air to reach Michael."Well guess this solves the mystery of the missing kid," Michael said to himself.The opening led way to what looked like a vertical dark tunnel leading straight down.A rusted metal ladder's last steps rested against the rim of the tunnel, just a few inches from Michael's feet.Michael grabbed a pebble from the ground next to him and dropped it down the tunnel.Almost a full minute went by.No sound.Wherever this tunnel was leading, it was way, *way* down.Michael turned back and, careful, brought his body down the hole, holding on to the first steps and feeling blindly with his feet for the support of the lower ones.The ladder seemed to hold out well, despite its old appearance.He climbed down one slow movement at a time, the loud echoing *clenk, clenk, clenk* of his footsteps amplified like he was surrounded by microphones.He pulled his flashlight from his backpack, bit onto the handle side and pointed it down.The light cast a white stain across the tunnel walls  they were dirt  but didn't reach the bottom, fading away into darkness some thirty steps under Michael's feet.He put the flashlight back in his backpack.*You know what?Stick to the mission.Let's deal with disappearing kids later.*

Michael turned his head up to restart the climbing just in time to see a shadow move nimbly over his head, emerging from a hole in the wall and climbing the steps fast as if it was running through flat land.The figure disappeared up the tunnel's opening, leaving an echoed giggle behind.A second later, the hatch fell down with a loud thud and the soft click of a lock, leaving Michael alone in the darkness.___________________

Jack finally had a moment to himself.The couches had been moved, the mattresses had 
been laid, the family had been fed, the dog had peed, the doors locked, the windows 
boarded finally the house was quiet and the frenzy was over and he could have a 
moment.He stepped out to the back porch, pulled the American Spirits pack he always kept hidden from Marjory under the kitchen sink (it was a testament to the power of nicotine addiction that in the midst of what looked to be a literal apocalypse, Jack had still remembered to snatch it from its hiding place before setting off for Jerry's house) and lit one.He sat on the swing bench, leaned back and breathed out a puff of gray.*What the fuck was going on with the world?*

The door creaked open by his side.He barely had time to throw the cigarette over the 
wooden rail and blow out the smoke before Marjory emerged and sat by his side."Oh.Hey, honey.How're the kids?"he blurted out, trying to sound casual.She smiled."Noah is asleep.Bea is in the bathroom."Jack nodded, still a bit startled by her sudden appearance."How are you holding up?"he asked, after a moment's silence.She was very quiet, very still.She looked from him to the dark open land extending 
beyond the porch towards the woods and darkness beyond."Do you ever feel lonely?"she 
asked."Huh?""Do you ever feel lonely?All by yourself, inside your own mind?"Jack snorted."Honey, are you okay?I mean, I know things are a little crazy, but "

"It must be very lonely," she continued, as if she had not heard him."Because the only way for you to feel another presence is through words.Right?And gestures and all"

"Marj, what are you talking about?"She was very quiet.Very still.She turned to him.Her pupils looked big and opaque, dilated by the country darkness."You never really *experience* another existence but your own.You've never felt someone else's mind, like the way I'm feeling hers.You just trade words with each other  sounds you make with your lips and symbols you make with your hands  and that's how you reach one another.Language.But that's such an imperfect way to connect, isn't it?No word is real.No word is true.You wear permanent gloves.You never touch one another."Jack didn't answer.He wanted to get up.He was feeling something  an uneasiness that he couldn't quite explain.But he didn't move.He had this crazy notion that if he got up, if he moved an inch even, something bad would happen."All you do," Marjorie continued, in a monotone, "is prance around making noises and gesturing to one another, desperate, desperate to prove to each other that you're really there.That there's really someone inside your head."Her eyes were very dark now, very opaque."This frantic dance, this tribal dance, this constant and desperate waving and shouting.Language.All to try and reach each other.To prove that you are not alone."She tilted her head sideways slightly."I've been inside your minds.I've felt each and every one of you  not your projected images, not the words you say, but the real you.My loneliness is different than yours."She was still.Impossibly still.Only her lips moved, and just barely enough to get the words out in the hushed whisper she spoke in."My loneliness is the loneliness of the whole universe," she said, and her eyes were all black now, completely dark, not a hint of white, the color of the woods beyond the house in the rim of the distant world ahead."My loneliness is an open field.Your loneliness is a locked room."She lifted her finger.Jack didn't move."And which one of us is sadder?Which one?"She touched his forehead with the tip of her finger, ever so gently, and he felt an immense peace take over him."Which one of us is sadder?"she repeated."Is it me, because I am everyone?"A cold icy feeling expanded from her fingertip all across his head, like a crawling frost, a coat of ice crackling over a warm surface, freezing everything in its path."Or is it you, because you are no one?"She lifted her finger.Jack closed his eyes.The coldness washed over his whole body, down to the tip of his toes.Beyond the porch, the darkness extended thick like oil, like dripping night, beyond the plain's edge and towards the faraway blackness of the woods under the heavy sky, where lay hidden all the endless secrets of life that Jack would never know.The world.His world.The only place he'd ever known.Jack felt alone.And then Jack was not anymore, and Uno opened another set of eyes._______

Rain closed her eyes and she was nine years old again.&nbsp;

She was nine years old, wandering alone through screams and chaos and cars on fire, 
eyes wide on the lookout for monsters.A woman held her by the wrist."Are 
you alone?Where are you mommy and daddy?"And Rain looked up, and the monster from the sky took the woman in its claws, and the 
woman screamed, and blood dripped on Rain's face as the monster flew her away.Rain ran and ran and ran until she found the big building with the pictures of mummies 
and stuffed animals by the door.The sign read Los Angeles Museum of Natural History.&nbsp;

Rain was seventeen, in the woods, hunting for wild hogs or deer or that one weird thing 
called Moropus she saw once.Cro was by her side, telling her all about how to stalk and 
be silent and not scare your prey.&nbsp;

With her eyes closed, Rain was thirty, walking alone through the broken ruins of Santa 
Clarita after burying Spielberg.Searching for shelter.Searching for Cro.Rain was thirty, walking up and down streets half taken by nature.Passing by traffic signs wrapped in vine, gutters sprouting dark green grass.Already only one day in and she was missing Spielberg.She was missing Cro.&nbsp;

Rain was forty-two, alone, leaned over by the fire, trying not to freeze.Rain was forty-two, all hope of seeing Cro again lost.All hope of seeing any other human being lost 
long ago inside her.Surrounded by the rumble of a crumbled building, Rain watched specs of ember dancing fire dances on their way up, mingling and disappearing among the stars.&nbsp;

Her eyes still closed, Rain was fifty-one, looking at her reflection in the puddle.Her once 
dark hair was painted in slivers of grey.Around her eyes, the wrinkles were filled with 
dust and dirt.She looked up from the puddle to the building towering in front of her.The 
words read USEU O ATURA ISTORY.In forty years, she had never gone back there.Not 
with Cro.Not alone.She stepped in.Rain was fifty-one, hearing the echo of each of her footsteps, making way further and 
further inside the museum.Past the gift shop.Past the bird cage.Past Alaska Culture 
and Climate.Past the ghosts of past exhibits.She was fifty-one, going back to the place 
where life as she knew for so long had begun, when she heard the voice.Reaching her in 
an echo traveling long empty corridors, the voice said "and I never saw her again after 
that day.I looked.For years I looked.First just in the city, then expanding the search.I've travelled, my friend.I've travelled like shit, I'll tell you.What's that?Yeah, I've 
missed you too, buddy.You're just a little too *stiff* for me, but I like you."Rain walked slowly, like every step might break the spell  might take the voice away.She turned the corner to find him sitting with his back against the wall, looking up to the 
replica of the Homo Erectus.The same face, not a day older.The air disappeared from 
her lungs and traveled in a loud whoosh through the room.He looked up from the replica and their eyes met for the first time in twenty-one years."Rain," Cro whispered, and his whisper was like home.&nbsp;

Now Rain had her eyes closed.She was eighty-one and had her eyes closed, watching her memories.She opened her eyes.She was on the second floor of the Mesozoic Era exhibit, looking down from the balcony at what was left of the T-Rex fossil.Her eyes focused on something.A small, human-like figure, black and white.Rain made way down the stairs slow, her back hurting, her breath shallow.She reached 
the T-Rex cranium and lowered her eyes.There, resting between the dinosaur's teeth like it was about to be eaten, the Jack 
Skellington doll rested, rotten in its edges and dirty almost beyond recognition.She crouched with difficulty and picked the doll up, dusting its body.All those years.Rain felt her throat dry and her eyes burn.She swallowed, turning the doll in her hand."There you are!"Cro's voice reached her from behind."You shouldn't wander like this 
alone, what if you fall?Come here."She felt his gentle grip on her arm and let herself be carried to a nearby bench."What's that in your " Cro paused, his eyes frozen on the doll.He looked up, and Rain 
found his eyes.She saw herself reflected in them.Old.Thin.Her milky white skin dotted in age spots."Thank you," she whispered, raising a veiny hand to Cro's face.She brushed his cheek."Thank you, Cro.""For what?"She smiled."For saving me from the monsters."Cro held her stare and smiled behind his full beard.They sat like that for a while, and she was happy they did.&nbsp;

Rain died on a Wednesday, and Cro buried her just outside by the fountain, where she had 
once held his hand for the first time.He put the Jack Skellington doll nested under her 
chest.In the afternoon wind, Cro looked up after the last of the dirt was back in place.The sky was grey, with few, scattered patches of deep, dark blue here and there.He took a deep breath and looked down at the ground again."Bye, Rain," he said to the dirt, leaning on the shovel."Hope I'll see you soon."Around him, the last of the birds chirped their goodnight songs as darkness began to fade in.Cro nodded to himself, wiping his eyes with his forearm.He turned around and started his way back to the museum.He stopped hallway and turned back.Eyes on the ground where Rain rested underneath, he took a 
deep breath."Thank you," he said."For not thinking *I* was the monster."The sky flashed in white, and a thunder rang in the distance.Cro looked back.The 
world around him roared in a fast wind lifting leaves and smaller branches from the 
ground.He felt a drop on his shoulder and then another.Then another and another and another, 
*pluck, pluck, pluck* like a thousand little bugs singing happy birthday in Morse code.Cro kneeled down and sat with his legs crossed by the fountain.The drops fell ever more frequent and thick, soaking through his shirt and making him shiver.But he didn't mind.He closed his eyes and smiled at the rain.

I spend the night between ATM skeletons inside a Bank of America building.Takes me about seven seconds from the moment I lay my head on the floor to falling asleep.In the morning, I check outside the windows for the weather.The rain stopped, which is nice.I wash my face with puddle water on the sidewalk just outside the bank.It's chilly and sunny -- good weather.Nice for hunting.Today is the day I'll find Amy and Zara.I look around.Nothing to my left.Nothing to the right.Nothing ahead.No 

"Oh my God."I stop.The voice came from behind me.A voice.A human *voice*.Like in *sounds that have meaning.*

"Are you real?"I turn around, slow-motion like the world might crumble if I move too fast, to find a 
woman standing by the alley next to the bank.Late thirties, like me.Hair and face a nightmare of scars, leaves and dirt  like me.Blue eyes and a scared-as-shit expression on her face  also like me.She takes a step closer."Are you going to hurt me?"She asks that, but takes another step.The way the world is, I'm thinking she's thinking 
that even if I murder her on the spot with a rusty chainsaw, it'd be worth it.Any human contact goes, if she's feeling anything like me."I'm real," I say, blinking fast."I mean, I think I am.""What's your name?""David Taylor," I say."Well, that's what I was called before when"

I don't know how to explain what happened to me (or the world), so I just stop talking.Her face agrees with me, though."Do you remember anything?"she asks."No," I say."I mean I remember just before.I was having breakfast with my family"

She nods."I was at work.""And a tall figure"

" in a lab coat"

We stop talking and just watch each other.She takes another step."Where did you wake up?""The woods," I say."Not far away from here.You?""Top of a building.No idea how I got there.Three months ago?""Three months."She nods again, and I notice her eyes are teary.Red.She's crying, but only exclusively 
with her eyes.Her voice doesn't flinch.The rest of her face is like rock.Gotta figure that's a strong-ass woman."It's huh it's good to see someone else," she says, after what feels like three weeks 
of silence."I thought I was the only one.""Yeah"

"Though I was going insane too, for a while."She's trembling a bit, but stays strong.I scratch my head.I feel like I should say something.Comfort her.Tell her it will be ok, that I have all the answers.I feel like I need to say anything, just to keep this moment going.Keep this moment real, because I fear I might wake up alone in Jungleland again at any second."What  what is your name?"I ask, finally.I shove my hands in my pocket like a 
freaking teenager.My fingers touch the old sheet of paper with the child handwriting exchange in my right pocket.The woman smiles a soft smile that doesn't go with her face at all."Tracy," she says, simply."Nice to meet you."_____________

Tracy nods."That's my handwriting, all right."I fold the paper back inside my pocket."I mean," she her hair away from her forehead, "it was when I was a kid.""Yeah.The paper looks pretty old, too.So the math adds up.""But it doesn't make any sense," Tracy continues."We didn't we never met.Have we?""Not that I recall."I lean my back against the glass front door of the bank."Even if we 
did  why would I have a paper with some chit-chat between us from thirty years ago in 
my pocket?""Are you sure it's *your* handwriting?""Would it make it any less weird if it wasn't?"She pauses."I guess not.""Anyway, I'm sure it's mine.My handwriting hasn't changed much since I was a kid.The fact is, at some point a *lot* of years ago,  we wrote this to one another.And for some reason I have it in my pocket."We sit in silence for a while.A quiet, distant roar echoes, hopefully far away.Here and there, I risk a glance at Tracy.I don't catch it, but I get the feeling she's risking glances at me too  we're just not matching the intervals.And I know we're both thinking the same thing.*Do we know each other?*

*What's up with the note?*

*Is there anyone else alive in the world?*

And especially -- *What the fuck is 'The Box'?*

I finally catch her eye."You're thinking what I'm thinking?"she asks."Yeah"

Tracy gets up.Offers me her hand."Then let's find some poor possum to call dinner."&nbsp;

We go hunting through the city-jungle.We are  I think  in West L.A.The looks and feel of the world around us put the apocalypse somewhere around twenty to thirty years ago.It really makes you think, looking at the city like this.The vines wrapped in the tumbled 
down light poles.The grass sprouting through the cracks on the street.Rusted 
everythings everywhere.Nature taking over.Makes you realize that civilization is always pushing back.That it's not stable at all  progress requires constant motion and maintaining.Nature's permanently trying to take back its place  one false move and it's back where it belongs.Whole buildings wrapped in green.Thick brown roots snaking up and down around cars 
and in between houses  coming out from the windows, the doors, the walls.It's like the Earth is saying 'excuse me, can I have this back now?'"What was your family like?"Tracy asks all of a sudden, pulling me out of my trance as we walk."Wife.One daughter," I say, keeping it short."Amy and Zara."She doesn't press it  thankfully."What about you?""No family."She doesn't say that with resentment  if anything, there's a little pride there."Not even a boyfriend?""Well, I didn't say *that*."She smiles."I worked at a big production company in 
Hollywood.Not a lot of men that could deal with my eighty-hours a week work schedule.The seven-digit salary also intimidated quite a few.""I see"

"Guess it doesn't matter now, though," she says, as we turn right on a narrow street."It's all gone, anyway.""Don't say that," I say."Don't say  hey, over there!"A shadow flashes on the other end of the street  running across the sidewalk into a 
house in no more than a second."What was that?"I ask, as we step near."Looked like a wild cat," Tracy replies.She pulls a knife from her pants.*Girl is prepared.Nice.*

I pull my knife too, and we stop in front of the house.I take the lead, looking left and right as I walk inside.You have to be careful.I mean wild cats are not exactly mountain lions, but they can 
still cause some pretty serious damage.And this is a world with no antibiotics or 

I stop.My eyes go around the room, in a trance.They stop at Tracy, just by the door.I see it in her face  she noticed it too.*What the fuck?*

All thought of wild cats forgotten, I drop my knife to the floor and reach the nearest 
wall.My hand runs down it, like touching it will make sense of what I'm seeing.The room is a mess, like the inside of every house everywhere I've ever been.The paint on the wall is coming off, the floor is covered in almost foot of dust the stairs are broken.All that is normal.All that I'm used to.But *this*?"Who did this?"Tracy whispers, reaching my side.Our eyes glued to the wall.And it's not just the wall in front of us.All around.Painted in red, the words spread like the diary of a madman.Handwritten like someone soaked their finger in red ink (or something else that's red) and smeared it.Even on the ceiling.*The Box.The Man in the Lab Coat.The Top of the World.Griffith.Tracy Morgan.David 
Taylor.The Box.The Man in the Lab Coat.The Top of the World.Griffith.Tracy Morgan.David Taylor.*

On and on, all over the walls.All over the ceiling.Some even on the floor, under the dust."David, what the fuck is this?Why are our names written all over the wall?"I turn to look at Tracy, but my eyes focus behind her.Halfway up the stairs to the 
second floor, sitting by the steps is the thing we thought was a wild cat.A pair of eyes watching me.It's a man.Thin and wrapped in layers of black rags, he's got his glance straight at us, his body rocking back and forth like an old lady's front porch chair.The smile across his face makes the hair on the back of my neck rise."Tracy"

She turns back and I notice her body stiffening when she spots the man.For a second, nobody says anything.Then the smile fades from the man's face.He pulls out a knife.And, before Tracy's scream even reaches my ears, he runs the blade across his neck, spraying the wall red on his way to the floor.________________

The three suns burst from the bottom of the large window of the spacecraft, slowly 
traveling their way up as the ship moved closer to the Gliese 667 system."Why is one of your suns blacked out?"Serling asked, from his seat."That's a Matrioshka Brain", the Simian explained, staring out the window by Serling's 
side."It's a Dyson Sphere working as a computing structure.""What?""It's a very, very large solar powered computer", the Simian said, with a faint smile.He 
turned to face Serling."I am sorry we had to do this, by the way."*This*, in that situation, consisted of having intercepted Serling's car on the way to the 
airport, murdered the driver and both security guards, then violently dragged a very reluctant Serling to a spaceship, where he was now."I don't know what to say", Serling whispered, and it was true."So say yes", the Simian replied."Say yes, Serling, and end this."The general wasn't tied, and he hadn't been tortured or hurt.In fact, once inside the 
spacecraft, the Simians had been nothing but polite and respectful to him.It's almost as if he wasn't a war prisoner."This is our home", the Simian said, as the spacecraft shifted, and Serling caught sight 
of a little blue planet, eerily similar to Earth, framed out the window."This is our 
planet."Serling didn't say anything.The Simian tossed him a side glance."Why did you start developing it?"Military technology", he asked."What do you mean?""You hadn't made contact, before us", the Simian said."So why develop defensive 
technology?"Serling opened his mouth, then closed again.He couldn't find a way to answer this 
without embarrassing his species, so he said nothing again.The Simian was not unlike the ones he had met before, expect a bit taller, maybe.When 
Serling first laid eyes on him, he wouldn't have guessed that this humble-looking figure 
was actually the one in charge of the whole species."We came back to protect ourselves, Mr. Serling", the Simian leader said."You sent the robots first, not us.""I know.""You started this war, not us.""I know.""We are just trying to stay alive.To survive humans."Serling sighed.Again, he said, "I know.""So say yes", the Simian pleaded, again."You know it to be the right thing to do."Serling closed his eyes.Images of the videos the Simian leader had showed him before 
flashed in his head.Women.Children.Innocent Simians burned alive, murdered brutally 
by the humans.Whole cities blown to dust in the blink of an eye.Death and despair.This is what the humans had done to the Simians, in the future.It was out of the blue, the Simian had explained, as the genocide footage played on the 
screen.They were caught off guard.Back on Earth, Axel had told Serling that the humans had started the war.But *seeing* it was very different."And after all that", the Simian had said."You came back in time to try and kill us before 
we even have a chance to defend ourselves.How can you still defend such a species?""I'm part of it", Serling had whispered, under his breath.This had all been hours before, when the Simian first explained his proposition to 
Serling.Now they were both watching as Gliese 667cc grew closer on the window frame, 
and Serling had a decision to make."You can stop this, Mr. Serling", the Simian said, simply."You can stop all this.""And if I say no?""If you say no this war will continue.If you say no, who knows how long it will last.Who knows if either species will survive?"The Simian paused."If you say no, you might 
be killing sentient life in the universe altogether."Eyes still closed, Serling took a deep breath."You would stay here?In the past?"Serling asked."I mean Your past.""Yes", the Simian said."I cannot go back.Time travel doesn't work like that.The future I 
lived in no longer exists.This, in fact, is why we  and humans  sent robots here to the past, mostly.Myself and the crew on this ship are the only Simians to have traveled, 
and we are staying.""And the humans?""Humanity would be able to carry on, through you", the Simian answered."And a 
selected group of other males and females, for procreation purposes.We would bring 
you back to Gliese, and you would be able to restart your species there.In peace."The 
alien paused, then, "in a hospitable planet, surrounded by a species that hasn't 
even developed military technology.""But everyone on Earth"

"If you are to grant us access to your intercontinental ballistic missiles, like we know 
you can, then, yes, we would use them to destroy the Earth", the Simian said, simply."But, like I said, humanity would live on through you and a selected group of others, in 
Gliese.In peace."Serling sighed.He kept his eyes closed and, for a long time, neither of them said anything."Can I ask you something?"The Simian asked, finally."Why did you decide to be a 
general?""I don't know", Serling answered."Have you always wanted to work for the army?Killing people?"Serling chuckled."I actually wanted to be a TV show host, when I was a kid."The Simian didn't answer, and, this time, the silence lasted for almost ten minutes.*All clear in base.Prepare for landing*, came a metallic voice from the ship's sound 
system."This is it", the Simian said."Have you made up your mind, Serling?"Serling thought of his apartment, back in Los Angeles.He thought of his friends at work, 
and of Sarah, his first girlfriend in high school.He thought of Jon Bon Jovi, his neighbor's cat, and of spaghetti and meatballs.Then Serling thought of Simian children and woman and men dying in their sleep and on their way to work and to the park and to the zoo, back in the videos the Simian leader had showed him.He thought of Vietnam, and World War II, and he thought of murder and death and torture.Then he opened his eyes."Mr.Serling?""Yeah", Serling said."Yeah, I made up my mind."_________________

"The war started five hundred years from now, give or take", Axel explained, between puffs of smoke."This is a shitty cigar, by the way.""I'm sorry, I'm not really a smoker", Serling replied."Can we get back to the issue at hand?""You know I'd never seen Earth before?I mean, except in holodecks", Axel remarked, looking past Sterling out the window."It's beautiful.""Yeah", Serling replied, without looking back."It's home.""Home", Axel repeated.He said the word like its meaning was distant and vague, something long lost to him.Serling stared at the man from the future.By his side, the chromed, tall droid stood still, its neon, red eyes gleaming silently at the room."Is it sentient?"Serling asked, with a nod to the robot."The A.I, I mean.""How should I know?"Axel replied, simply.The man from the future and the chrome droid had arrived three nights before.Serling was in the middle of what felt like his one hundredth meeting regarding the Simians at the White House when a young man burst through the door, interrupting the president mid-speech.You gotta figure it's something important when a twenty-something interrupts the president."Mr. President, there's someone here to see you", the young man said, sweaty and out of breath."Who?"the president asked."I think he should tell you himself", the young man said.Then they brought in Axel, and, still in the meeting room, Axel explained to them that he was from Kepler 186f."Kepler 186f is a deserted plan "

"*Future* Kepler, Mr. President", Axel corrected, and the room went silent.After all was said and done, Serling was assigned to care for the man from the future, while the UN and the government would work on the diplomatic issues regarding the Simians (read: 
stalling), until humanity had come to a conclusion as to what the hell they were going to do about this mess.Now it was his third session with Axel, and Serling was beginning to realize that the man from the future had brought with him more questions than answers."So what?You guys were living happily in Kepler when all of a sudden these Simian folks attacked, and then you sent *terminators* back in time to destroy them before the war?""Well, they don't look like Arnold Schwarzenegger", Axel replied.He smiled at Serling's face."We got movies in the future, general Serling.I know Arnold Schwarzenegger."Serling shook his head."This doesn't make sense", he said."The Simians don't have a military.They never developed one.Which is why they are asking for our help in the first place.How could 
they be in a war?""They don't have a military *now*.They will start developing one pretty soon, now that they made contact.Which is why we sent the droids to this time.""To do what?Kill civilians?Innocent people?"Axel shook his head."Aliens.Not people, general.Aliens."Serling hid his face behind his open hands, taking a deep breath."Who started this, anyway?The war?"He asked, finally."We did", Axel answered, simply."Kepler was running dry, like Earth did, so many years before.We needed a new planet.Gliese 667  the Simian's planet  was a perfect match.""That doesn't  what  *there were people living there already!*" Serling shouted."Who cares if it's habitable?Does that justify killing people who already live there?""You keep saying *people*" Axel muttered, under his breath."They are alive!They are living conscious sentinet *whatever*!"Serling yelled, frustrated.Axel didn't answer.Serling got up from his chair and turned back to face the window.Fifty stores down, Earth stared back at him in silence.He made out tinny spots of colorful cars rushing left and right on the 405 superhighway.People.Living their day to day lives.Picking their kids up from school.Going to dinner.Texting and talking and falling in love and writing songs."Wait", Serling whispered, all of a sudden.A thought had occurred to him."How did we develop the technology?""What technology?"Serling made way back to the desk, but did not sit."In Kepler.For time travel.Did we develop it ourselves, or did you learn it from the "

Serling's phone rang.Axel kept his eye on him, taking a drag from the cigar.Slowly, fearing what would be on the other end of the line, Serling brought the phone to his ear."Yes?""General Serling, this is Bill Stanley", Serling heard the voice of the vice-president."There's a car waiting outside your building.Get inside it.We're bringing you to 
the White House.*Now.*"

"Whe-where is the president?"Serling asked, eyes still on Axel."The president is dead, general Serling", the vice-president responded."White House.*Now*."Serling dropped the phone.He looked down, then up at the man on the other side of the desk.Axel had his eyes focused somewhere behind Serling, frozen shock all over his face.In slow-motion, Serling turned his head.Out the window, the blue, cloudless Los Angeles sky was covered in bright, white dots, hovering silently over the city."What is that?"Serling asked, his voice shaking in every word."Simian spacecraft", Axel responded, in a tense whisper.And then Serling heard the first explosion.__________________________

I am home.Home as in 2015 home.As in on the same timeline as you.I'm back from 1986, and I 
don't even have a spiked bracelet or a Bon Jovi vinyl disc to show for it.Let me tell you how I got back:

_____________________

They got to me, after my last post.I had barely hit 'submit' on the screen when I felt a 
hand on my shoulder.I turned back, and it was the old lady that was behind me on the 
plane (the one that was scribbling furiously and looking at me).I said "Hey!"and she stuffed my head inside a black bag.Then I felt something pinch me 
in the arm, and I passed out.Where I woke up was that lab I saw on the Youtube video.At least it looked like it.White walls, computer screens.Fancy stuff.And me, alone on a chair in the middle.Silence around me.I don't know how long I was in there for.I roamed around.I tried the door (locked).I 
looked on drawers and closets for something that could help me escape, but there was 
nothing.I panicked, for a while, out of boredom.When I had finally given up the door burst open, and who came inside was the flight 
attendant.The one with the in-humane scream and the book.She stood there by the 
door, looking at me for what felt like ages.I said, "Yes?"And she walked closer to me, and she rested a hand on my shoulder, and she said, 
"They are going to hurt you.The wooden door with no knob on the end of the main hall 
is your only way.Go for the door when --"

And then a hand sprouted out from nowhere behind her head and covered her mouth 
with what looked like a piece of wet cloth.Then her eyes rolled up and she passed out, 
and the man standing behind her held her body and gently placed it on the floor.That man was the old man with the scar.The one from the Youtube video."Walk with me, Psycho", he said, signaling the door.I didn't really have much else to do, so I accepted the invitation, and down a long, white 
hallway that seemed to go on forever we went."I know you have a lot of questions", he started, walking by my side."And I'll try to 
answer them best I can.The first thing you need to understand, though, is that this 
started out as something good.Something that would benefit mankind."He said *mankind* in a way like he wasn't a part of it.So I decided to ask."Are you an alien?"I wasn't even embarrassed about asking this, and I didn't ask it in 
like a mocking tone, like trying to express that I found the very notion of him being an 
alien ridiculous.No, I was pretty serious.I actually wanted to know if this man was an alien.The man snorted."No.No, Psycho, I am not an alien.I'm all human.This way."We made a left on another endless-looking hallway."I am a scientist.I am a man who 
made a pretty big impact on the world, in the year 2055.Do you know what I did?""Sorry, no.But I'm from 2015, so don't feel offended.""I know when you are from", he said.Then he continued in the same monotonic voice, 
"Psycho, I was amongst the first scientists who were able to understand exactly what 
had happened, that October morning in Philadelphia.I figured out and wrote down the 
equations that lead to a full understanding of how exactly the fabric of space-time had 
distorted.What exactly had happened.I did that in April, 2055.""Huh", I said, because that's exactly how much I can contribute to a conversation 
involving the distortion of space-time fabric."Huh...Huh.""But I did more than that.Please, step inside."The old man with the scar signalized a 
double black door in front of us and, seemingly to his command, it opened.I walked into 
a large room with weird looking machines and screens and people in lab coats all over 
the place.There was a wooden door with no knob on the far left side."This is our headquarters.A temporary lab we bring with us, whenever we jump.""Wait.You jumped, too?I thought only me and the old-young guy had traveled in time.""Psycho, the people on that plane, when you jumped, they work for me.Including the 
gentlemen you met earlier today.Even I was on that plane, though I don't think we saw each other."I took a good look around.The scribbling old lady was by a computer screen, typing 
away.The two NPC dudes, checking on some equipment on the other side.The man 
listening to music with the phones attached to nothing was checking some papers by a 
metal desk."So they were in on it?"I asked, confused."Everyone on the plane was in on it?""Well, not everyone, but we'll get to that in a moment.""What about the flight attendant?Why did you --"

"The flight attendant also works for us.But... well..." Here the man with the scar 
seemed a bit uncomfortable.Even embarrassed."In our line of work, it's easy to 
become... unstable.We travel back and forth in time and -- well -- the human brain 
wasn't really built to comprehend or deal with this kind of thing.Unfortunately, Miss Dangley's mind couldn't quite handle the pressure of our line of work.She is going to be treated and medicated.You can understand this, right?"As if on cue, two man in lab coats passed by, each carrying the flight attendant by one 
arm,  dragging her across the room.Her dizzy, drowsy eyes met mine, and then she looked away at the door with no knob, 
like she was trying to tell me something."Look, sir", I said, turning to face him."I'm going to be honest here: there's nothing 
about this I can currently understand."The man with the scar smiled."Let me try to clear everything for you.A lot of this is 
going to sound confusing, but bear with me."He took a deep breath."When we first solved the problem of the Philadelphia, back in 2055, we were able to 
retrieve a single survivor from the Eldridge ship.This was Captain Jackson, the man you met 
on the plane.The one that turned from old to young.He was *fished* from his time to 
ours, in 2055, through a series of complicated process I won't bore you with, but that 
had to do with the research I was conducting at the time.When information on my research -- and the man from 1943 I had retrieved to 2055
-- reached the government, some very powerful men took over.High government 
people.Suited people.FBI.NSA.Some agencies I hadn't ever hear of, before.They took 
over my research and, suddenly, my team was working for them.They turned the research into a project, which was called Project Hurricane.What my theory had made possible for these men to do was, in short words, to 
assemble a team to travel back in time and change the course of human events.Not just to 1943, but to anytime we chose.Jackson, the Captain of the Philadelphia, was -- and still is -- the *jump* man of our time travelling team.He is our link between 2055 and all times that came before.How the system works is we place ourselves -- the team -- alongside Mr. Jackson aboard a high speed transport -- a plane, or a fast train, for instance -- and then the jump happens.We can travel to whatever time we want.This is how we got from 2055 to 2015.And then from 2015 to 1986, which is where we 
are now.Don't ask me why it is so.We just know that the jump only works when Mr. Jackson is 
traveling at fast speeds.So that is what we do.Project Hurricane's scope was to fix the Earth.The year 2055 was quite different, before 
we meddled with the past.John Kennedy and Khrushchev, for example, almost 
destroyed the Earth through nuclear war, before we intervened.The 'spaceship' that crashed in Roswell was not filled with little green man at all, but 
with something much more sinister, and it hadn't actually crashed, but rather *landed* safely 
on the New Mexico Desert.We changed that, too."Wait, wait", I said, pressing my eyes shut, trying to absorb it all."So you've been 
jumping back and forth through the twentieth century in order to change potential 
disasters that might have destroyed the Earth?""Not potential, Psycho", the man replied."Those disasters actually happened, before we went back and changed them."I nodded, beginning to understand what he was saying.Or at least I thought so."Anyway.There were side effects, as you may have noticed.We found out soon enough 
that the people inside the trains and planes we used to jump, they traveled with us, to 
whatever time we were going to.As a matter of fact, you are the first of these *victims* 
to actually remember the jump.""So the other people on the plane..."

"They left JFK airport believing they always lived in 1986.They're out there right now, living life as if nothing is wrong.Which brings us to the issue at hand, Psycho.To the reason why we jumped here, in 
1986.You see, this is our last ever jump.""What?""The side effects.These 'time orphans' -- that's how we call the people we left stranded 
on a time they don't belong to, like you -- they're beginning to disrupt the future.They're 
changing and meddling with the past, and we are experiencing some very bizarre -- and 
dangerous -- consequences of that.You've seen this happen first hand, actually.On the plane.The man that changed his hair color.The boy that turned to a girl.""So, let me see if I got this straight", I said."You guys have been jumping back and forth 
in time, changing the course of human history, and leaving a trail of 'time orphans' on 
several different times in human history.And these time orphans are causing the world 
to collapse, in the future?""They are changing things that, to them, seem tiny and small, but some of them have horrible repercussions in the future.Which is why we are here.The jump you took part in, this one from 2015 to 1986 -- is our last.This is the jump that is going to end Project 
Hurricane.""End Project Hurricane?""Yes.We have found that the only way to stop the potential disasters of having the time 
orphans meddling randomly with the past is to end the Project all together.Before it 
even begun.""So all the changes the project did?JFK and Roswell...?""They'll be erased.But this is a small price to pay in order to protect the future from 
random shifts in reality caused by the orphans."I had no time to try and absorb all that at the moment.So I pressed on the subject that 
concerned me the most:

"And why am I here?What is my job in this?"The man with the scar looked at me and frowned.Then he shook his head."No.No, 
Psycho.You weren't supposed to be here.You were an accident.Like I said, you are an 
orphan.We didn't know you were going to be on that plane.And we *definitely* didn't 
know you were going to be the first time orphan to *actually remember* the jump.It is 
a remarkable coincidence, if you think about it.But that is all.""But if I -- "

I stopped.Something had occurred to me."Why is this a remarkable coincidence?"I asked, cautious.The man with the scar closed his eyes."What are you doing in 1986?"He opened his eyes again."We are here to prevent your parents from meeting each other."I stared at him blankly."What?""We need to end Project Hurricane, Psycho.It destroys the world.No matter the good 
things it did -- avoiding atomic attacks, wars, genocides -- the consequences of the 
project itself -- and of leaving people out of their time zones to meddle with the future at 
random -- are much worst.We've seen what happens in the future.Chaos.Destruction.Death.We need to shut down Project Hurricane before it ever begins."My heart was beating fast, now.Everyone in the room was looking at me.I glanced at the door with no knob quickly.Then back at the man with the scar on his 
forehead."What does this have to do with *my parents*?""You need to *not* exist, Psycho.""No!What are you talking about?I have nothing to do with Project Hurricane!I don't 
even know any of you!""You have *everything* to do with Project Hurricane", the old man said."And the only 
way to stop Project Hurricane from existing is to stop *you*... from existing."The man's eyes locked on mine.He looked sad, defeated.Like he had long ago resigned 
to a truth he couldn't fight against."I wish it didn't have to be like that, Psycho.I really do.""No... No", I mumbled, looking left and right with my hand extended in front of my 
chest.I felt dizzy, like I was about to pass out.I felt sick.I looked at the door with no knob again.This was it.Now or never.I wasn't following most of what was going on, but I did know this: I wasn't going to stick 
around to watch them trying to make me *not exist*, whatever the hell that meant.I made a run for the door, without thinking twice."Psycho, no!"The man screamed, as I got closer to the door with each step."If you go 
through this door, you're going to close the time fold for all of us."I pushed the door open."If you go through that door, we have to start over.Project Hurricane happens all over 
again.And all over again we're going to have to go through losing so many people to 
realize it was a mistake.Don't let this happen, Psycho."On the other end of the door was nothing but darkness.Not like a dark room, no.I mean 
actual darkness.Like the universe actually ended after that door, and there was no more 
space there.Like a solid darkness.I looked back.The old man with the scar on his 
forehead was looking at me with sadness in his eyes."It won't change anything, Psycho..." He said, sadly."It will just make people suffer all 
over again.Then we will invent Project Hurricane again, and again we will realize it was 
a mistake.Then we will have to come back again.Because this has to be done.You have 
to cease existing."He was crying."It's the only way, Psycho."I looked back in front of me at the darkness.I took a step forward.___________________________________

And now I'm here.I fell and I fell and I fell through the dark, to the point where I 
actually thought I'd never stop falling.But I did, and when it happened, I had landed on 
my seat, on the flight from Paris to New York, except in 2015 now.The young-old man behind me was not there.Neither were the weird flight attendant or 
the man listening to music with no music device.The plane landed on JFK with no issues, and I headed home.I am fine now, as far as I can tell.*Well*... Not fine *fine*, per se.I did feel a bit dizzy a couple of hours ago and I threw 
up and I passed out.I banged my head pretty nastily against my center table.I actually had to get stitches at the hospital.But I'm fine.Far as I can tell, I'm perfectly fine, and this was all just a weird, in flight dream.Those 
damn pills I take to calm myself, whenever I take a plane.Yeah.That's probably it.I wash my face, and I raise my eyes to my reflection on the medicine cabinet mirror.I touch the stitches on my forehead lightly, and they burn in pain.I pull my hand away."Ouch", I mutter.That hurt.It's probably going to leave a scar.

Rains feet hurt like being told to fuck off by a puppy.She was running for what felt like days now, too scared to look back.Cro ran by her side  a courtesy, she was sure, as he could easily outrun her.Out from the supermarket, they had managed to shoot back into the alley they came from, too narrow for the Spinosaurus.The beast was searching for them still.They could hear the *TUM*, *TUM*, of 
its footsteps, coming from the left, then the right, then the back, a different direction 
with every turn they took in the dark."Here," Cro said, holding her shoulder.He pulled her under the metal awning of a fire 
escape."I think we lost it."Rain stopped, out of breath.She pressed her back against the brick wall, opening her ears for any sound.The thuds were growing distant."It's gone," Cro said."Where's Spielberg?"Cro waved the flashlight around.The light crawled past concrete, garbage and rumble.No Spielberg."I'm sure he knows his way back home," Cro said.He looked around at the darkness."The question is -- do we?"Rain looked up.She had her hand on her knees, panting for air."There."Cro looked where she was pointing.The half-torn building sprouted over the top of 
smaller houses in the distance, bathed in moonlight a few blocks away."We walked for like an hour, how can it be that close?""It's easy to walk in circles in the dark," Rain replied."I'd think that's something you 
would know.""I never hunted in the dark," Cro replied."I'm not that stupid."A flash of Roy's grinning face danced in front of Rain's eyes for a second.*We almost died because of that idiot.*

"Come on," Cro said, after a moment."Let's go back."They restarted the walk, slow and careful now, Cro shinning the light in front of their 
feet left and right with each step.They made a turn into a wide space.Rotten leftovers from an avenue sprinkled in 
bended light poles and blocks of concrete.The half-torn building towered itself less than 
half a mile in front.*TUM.*

They stopped.Rain looked back.Darkness.She looked to her right.To her left.All dark.*TUM.*

Cro's eyes met hers.For a second, neither of them said anything.*TUM.*

Cro flashed the light over Rain's shoulder.His eyes went wide."RUN!"The roar came just as Rain took the first step, forcing every inch of her body to keep sprinting despite the pain.*TUM.TUM.TUM.TUM.*

She didn't dare look back.*How many of their steps counted as one of the Spinosaurus?How many 'TUMs' until it reaches them?*

*TUM.TUM.TUM,* faster with each step."Go!"Cro said, as he shone the light across to the underground garage."Go, go, go!"Rain pushed forward, her breath burning.She reached the front of the building when a crashing sound came like an avalanche above them.Behind, the *TUM TUM* of the Spinosaurus came to a halt.Rain looked up just in time.What once was the external structure of the fourth floor in 
the half-building came cruising down towards her  three enormous blocks of steel and concrete coming down at gravity speed.She jumped to the side, watching the pieces crash against the pavement, spitting a cloud of dust into the air.Up by the building were the concrete had collapsed, the colossal head of a Tyrannosaurus emerged between the metal bars of the internal structure.It's mouth ripping open, it let out a huge "MOTHERFUCKEEEEEEEEER! "But not at Rain.Not at Cro.The Spinosaurus' foot came down not three inches from Rain's body, carving a shape on 
the pavement.The animal took another step and matched the T-Rex's eye.Rain felt a pair of hands under her shoulders and was brought up to her feet."We gotta go!"Cro yelled, over the sound of the dinosaurs slamming necks above.More dust and rumbled fell around them."What about the others!?"Just as she spoke, a figure emerged from the darkness of the garage in front of them."Let's go, let's go!"Simpson yelled, running towards them as he waved to the others 
behind.Roy, Linda and Jackson followed from the darkness, all covered in dirt and bruises."What the fuck did you guys do!?"Roy yelled as he reached them.Above their heads, 
the dinosaurs continued their death match in loud roars and thunder sounds.Rain caught a glimpse of the Spinosaurus head colliding hard against the neighbor building.More rumble fell between them."Where are the others?"Cro yelled, as Roy went past him."Fuck the others, they're dead!"Roy grunted back."I'm not sitting ar "

The tail came like God himself had whipped him, sending Roy's body flying away against 
a dumpster.The Spinosaurus' seemed to barely notice it, its focus still on the T-Rex.From the ground, Roy let out a deep scream of pain."I broke my foot!I broke my foot!"Rain looked around, lost.From deep within the mist of her haze, she remembered."Spielberg!"she yelled, as the others ran towards Roy."Spielberg's still in there!""Rain, we gotta go!"Cro stayed behind.The others hesitated, looking from the road 
ahead to the building circled by the two monsters.Just as Rain was about to go in, the velociraptor's figure emerged from the garage, 
sprinting on its hind legs, its head raised up high.It let out a loud *screech* of joy at the sight of Rain."Yes!"Rain smiled, opening her arms as it approached.*Screech!Screech!Scree --*

Rain's eyes widened in horror as the T-Rex's jaw close in on Spielberg's tiny body, lifting it up in the air with ease."NO!"Above, the half-building was more and more crumbling in ever large pieces, threatening 
to come down at any second."Rain!Now!Come on!""Don't leave me here!"Roy yelled.The T-Rex threw Spielberg's body up in the air, adjusting its grip as it caught the 
creature between its teeth again.Rain turned back.In a sudden -- and insane -- movement, she reached for Cro's pants, 
closing her fingers on the handgun."Rain, no!"Without thinking, she rose the gun and fired at the T-Rex.Again and again, the blasting 
sounds making her ears ring.The animal tumbled back an inch, its eyes going all around.Rain kept shooting.The animal finally released Spielberg, turning its eyes to the tiny, weird humans under its feet.Rain ran towards the velociraptor as its body banged against the floor."Come on, Rain!"She pulled Spielberg up, wrapping him around her arms like a baby."Get me up, come on!"Rain looked back.Linda, Jackson and Simpson were trying to lift Roy up on his feet by the dumpster.Cro grabbed Rain's arm, and they made way towards the others."Come on, you idiots!Don't grab the feet!By the shoulder!Come on, get me up, you freaking --"

Cro's punch put an end to Roy's screams -- and consciousness.With a swift movement, he pulled Roy off of his feet, throwing his body over his shoulder like a sack of shit.Rain noticed the silence.The fight had stopped.She turned back.The Spinosaurus and the T-Rex both had curious eyes on them now, in a silent agreement that tiny things were an easier prey.For a second, nobody moved.Then everybody moved at once.They ran.Behind them, the sound restarted, double-tempo now: *TUM TUM.TUM TUM.TUM TUM.*

Spielberg was not that heavy, but Rain's body was already about to give in *before* the 
big dinosaur death match.She begun to fall behind.She could feel the breath on her neck  if the Spinosaurus' of the T-Rex's, it didn't 
matter.She pushed herself to run faster, pressing her eyes closed.When she opened them, a shadow over her head blocked the moonlight, and she found herself in almost total darkness.The T-Rex went past her, a pavement-crushing step on each side of her body as it marched forward towards the others.Rain stopped, to exhausted to keep running.She turned back.The Spinosaurus tilted its head up in the air in an ear-crushing roar, turning its green eyes at her a second later.It was calling dibs._____________

"Well, this is a little awkward," Bella, the Terrible, said, averting her eyes from the nursery room door at the edge of the living room."Quite frankly, I think so too," Linda, the Awful, replied.Standing between them, Sarah bit her lips, eyes down to the floor.Sam, her husband, bit his nails by her side."I'm sorry guys," Sam said, finally."I had no idea Sarah had promised "

"Well, what you knew or didn't know doesn't matter," Bella said."The fact is the baby was promised to me.So 
your promise with Linda is void.""But I didn't know the baby had been promised," Linda intervened."Why should I not get my part of the deal just  because *he* made a mistake?I fulfilled *his* wish.He got the new job, right?""Let's just split the God-damned baby in half," Bella suggested."No!That's awful!"Sarah cried."Oh, sure.But promising your baby to a witch in exchange for Oasis tickets is fine.""What?It was the reunion.God knows when those two brothers will get together again.""Look, let's just take the baby," Linda said, "and we'll decide what to do when we reach the woods.""Sounds fair."The witches went around Sarah and started for the nursery, their long-nailed hands sprouting menacingly from their long robes."Stop right there!"Everyone turned to look.A man in a magician top hat shinning in glitter was standing by the door, a cane raised dramatically above his head."And who is this?""I'm Marook, the Tenebrous," the man said."That baby is mine.""Who promised you that baby!?""Huh I did," Sam said."What!?"Linda turned to Sam."But you promised it to me!""Yeah, but then I kind of re-mortgaged it to Marook when a promotion came up on my job.""So you sold the baby to me to get the job, then sold it to Marook to get a promotion on that job!?""That's really evil, Sam," Sarah whispered."Oasis concert, Sarah.""You're just gonna throw that one in my face forever, aren't you?"Marook lowered his cane and stepped in, his three legs clip-clopping loudly against the linoleum."Well, this is all very pleasant, but if you dont mind, I have a baby to take home with me.""Not so fast!"They all turned to the window this time.A man in a black suit and black tie and black shirt climbed through.He 
looked like an FBI agent.Normal and human from head to toe, except for the trident he carried in his left hand."What now?""That baby is mine!"The man proclaimed."And who the fuck are you?""I have many names.The Devil.Father of Lies.Demon.Beelzebub.King of Babylon.The Big Dicked One.""I feel like you made the last one up," Sam pointed."Silence!"The devil stopped in front of them."That woman promised me her baby!"he said, pointing an inquisitive 
finger at Sarah."In exchange for what!?""For Oasis playing Champagne Supernova at their concert."A silence took over the room.Sam turned to Sarah: "Really?""They never play it live, and it's my favorite song!""Jesus Christ, Sarah, you are an awful person.""You re-mortgaged our baby for a promotion!""Silence!"Bella exclaimed.Everyone stopped and stared at each other, their positions forming a semi-circle around the large living room.Deep breaths were taken, tongues and lips clicked and heads scratched.Finally, Linda opened her arms."Well what do we do?""We can cut it in several pieces, I guess" the devil suggested."Not so fast!"They all turned.From the door came in a man in long white robes and brown hair.He walked proudly and 
confidently towards the group."And who are you?""Jesus Christ..." the devil said, with an angry look at the long haired man."What are you doing here?""Hello, Big Dicked One.I am here "

"Let me guess: to take the baby."Bella turned to Sam and Sarah."Which one of you remortgaged the baby to 
Jesus?"Sarah and Sam exchanged looks, then shrugged."Not me.""I didn't.""Nope," Jesus said, approaching them."It wasn't the parents.The baby promised his own soul to me.And since my power supersedes all of yours, I'm the one who takes the baby home.Sorry guys."Jesus took confident steps across the room and disappeared inside the nursery.He came back a second later with 
the baby wrapped in blankets in his arms.A collective frown took over everyone's forehead as they watched, powerless, the son of God taking the baby away.Jesus was by the door when the devil scratched his throat."Wait.What did the baby want in exchange for its 
soul?"Jesus smiled, hand on the knob, and turned to Sam and Sarah."Better parents."

"Get off my property, you freak!"The gun blasted."Fuck!"Hagrid cried, as Vernon lowered the shotgun, hands shaking."Vernon, what happe -- oh my God!"Aunt Petunia raised her hands to her mouth, horrified."Call the police, Petunia!This giant man's got a bomb!""It's not a bomb, it's your nephew!"Hagrid yelled.He looked down at what was left of the baby nested between the 
blood-covered sheets."Well, it was.""Oh my God!"Vernon cried."What have I done!?"He turned the gun on himself.Little Dudley watched from the corner.&nbsp;

"The kid's an idiot, Dumbledore," Snape said, pacing from left to right inside the office."I'm telling you, if this is 
the kid you want to raise to be the one to fight against Lord Voldemort, we're in trouble.""Well, he's all that's left, Snape.Potter is dead.""Yes, but --"

"And now Voldemort is going to go after the *other* kid who can fulfill the prophecy.""But Longbottom is an idiot!""Snape, you have to protect him.""God Damn it, this couldn't get any worse.""Well, if Potter had lived you'd have to help me protect the son of James and Lilly Potter.That would have been worse."Snape stopped his pacing and nodded."Yeah, you're right, that would have been hell."&nbsp;

"That kid's not gonna make it through the first task, Albus.""Well, what on Earth do you want me to do, Snape?I didn't *choose* the idiot, the prophecy did.And that stupid muggle with the shotgun.""Who on Earth put Longbottom's name on the Goblet of Fire, anyway?""I don't know.There's an all powerful wizard out there who heard a prophecy about how he must kill Neville and 
will stop at nothing to try to do it.But I don't know.""Can't we just... have him *not play*?He doesn't even wanna do it.""No, Severus.Tradition is more important than human life.The kid has to play."&nbsp;


"CLOSE YOUR BLOODY MIND, LONGBOTTOM!""I'm trying!I'm trying!""Again!Legilimens!"Snape's head was filled with the image of a Rememberall.The imposing face of an old lady.Plants.More plants.""God damn it, never mind, Longbottom.Your mind's so boring I doubt Voldemort would find anything useful in there."&nbsp;

The snake bite hurt, but it hurt less than seven years of trying to teach Neville Longbottom how to perform a quality spell.The boy crouched in front of him."Snape!Snape, are you ok?""I know you hate me, Neville... but you must know the truth.""Are you gonna tell me where the Philosopher's Stone is hidden?""YOU DIDN'T FIGURE THAT ONE OUT YET?"Neville grabbed Professor Snape's hand, and Snape pulled him close."Look at me."The brown eyes met the black.For a second, neither of them moved."You're an imbecile, Longbottom."

*You never know dark until you walk through the nightscape of a city twenty-one years 
into abandonment,* Rain thought.*Well, except when you close your eyes,* she thought.Then she felt kind of stupid, trying to come up with these definite statements inside her head without thinking them through first.They had been walking for close to an hour.The tunnel of dust cast by the flashlight was the only light they could see.It shone in a circle of brightness, bringing to view rumble, cars, skeletons, baby strollers no food.No animals.No nothing."This is ridiculous, let's just go back," Rain said, after a while, as they made a left on what once looked like an alley."We're not gonna find anything.""How about some eggs?"Cro asked, flashing the light on a nest under an awning.Rain scoffed."Yeah, I'm sure mama dino wouldn't come after us if we take just the ugly one."They kept walking.More unsettling than the darkness, Rain thought, was the silence.The crunching of their feet on the floor was loud enough that it echoed across every corner.No cicadas.No birds.Just the sound of them, and what hopefully wasn't the silence of a Protoceraptor ready to charge."What was it like in I don't know, the Middle-Ages?"Rain asked, just to break the eerie lack of noise."What?""You know, you've been alive since forever.Tell me about some cool stuff from history.What was ancient Greece like?"Cro shrugged."I wouldn't know.I told you, I spent most of my life hiding from people.""Boring," Rain said.They kept walking."It's hard," Cro said after a while, as they reached the end of the alley into what looked 
like a parking lot."What is?""Being alive this long."Cro's voice was quiet, low-toned.He rarely talked about his past, 
and, when he did, it was in short words, like just before."Why?"Cro shook his head.They crossed past the gate and stopped in front of a building that, in 
a distant past, was maybe a supermarket."I don't know.It's lonely.I spent so much time alone.And now, even when I'm not, well people don't really have that much in common with me.It's hard to like someone who eats raw meat and grunts when they feel threatened.""Well, I like you.""Also, I'm short.Sucks to be short."He was.Like two inches shorter than Rain, who wasn't herself exactly a Victoria's Secret 
Angel.Cro looked up at the torn sign over their heads.It read ARGET CITY."Should we go in?""Meh," Rain replied."Might as well come back with some boxes of expired Mac and 
Cheese, so Roy won't throw a tantrum.Can't arrive with empty hands.""Hands?"Cro lowered his eyes to Rain's stump.Rain smirked."Smartass caveman."She gave him her still available left middle-finger on her way in.&nbsp;


Inside was cold, which Rain took as good news.Cold places weren't usually used as 
nests by the dinos.And quiet, which was also good news, but made Rain feel weird.That *clomp clomp* of their steps down the aisles that rhythmic end-of-the-world beat.Over their heads, a carpet of stars shone silently.The place had no roof.Rain wondered how *that* had happened.She thought back on going to the market with her parents when she was a kid.Looking 
around the dusty, broken space around her, she saw the lines forming from the cashiers 
fading into view.Old women and families and people choosing wines like ghosts.Opening and closing fridges.Deciding between Diet Coke or regular.Talking about the 
weather.Running into ex-girlfriends.The sound of a hundred different conversations 
hissing all around grew in Rain's ear.She missed what few memories she had of the days before the end."Do you hear that?"Rain turned to Cro, snapping back to reality."What?""Can't you hear it?"She couldn't, but Spielberg aparrently could.The silhouette of the velociraptor had 
stopped on its feet just ahead of them, its head raised and turning from one side to the 
other, startled."What is it?I can't hear anything."Rain, she had evolved to recognize the sound of a new text in a second.Her instincts 
buried deep into her DNA never let her miss the tiniest vibration in her pocket.She was 
hard-wired to understand sarcasm in written form and to read into symbolism in novels, 
all right.But in terms of hearing predators, Cro and Spielberg were miles ahead of her."It's breathing," Cro said, as Spielberg lowered its head."There's something here."And now she heard it too.What her twenty-first century brain had dismissed for a 
humming of air-conditioning, perhaps, now popped up into perception.*Wooosh.* 
*Wooosh.* Long enough to fill a lung way bigger than Rain's or Cro's."Let's get out of here."In the dark, Cro nodded.He raised the flashlight to Spielberg."Come on boy."Spielberg turned its head and moved a couple of inches to the left, letting the light shine through to the far end of the store.Rain's heart skipped a beat.Then it skipped another and, for a couple of seconds, 
pondered whether to just say 'fuck it' and stop right there and die.In front of them, the dimming circle of light was shining over a huge pattern of grey 
flakes.So large it expanded into darkness beyond the edges of light.The contours of an elliptical form drew itself on the center of the pattern.A closed eye.Just as Rain was about to tell Cro to turn off the flashlight, the eyelids went up.A shade of soft, almost translucent green shone against the light, dotted in the middle 
by a black pupil.As soon as it appeared, the black dot stretched into a thin strip against the light.In a silent movement, the gigantic head turned, and a set of  there was really no other way to put it  penis-sized, conical teeth presented itself against the light.The jaw extended long and wide like a crocodile's mouth, ending in a neck that gave way in the back to a flat hump, like an Asian princess' fan, disappearing into the dark beyond the light."Spinosaurus," Rain whispered, as the creature's body rose slow from the ground.The flashlight shone against a thousand chains of grey flake scrolling up until it framed a single, monstrous foot."Is that thing fast?"Cro asked, his voice barely a whisper as he grabbed Rain's arm.He pulled back."I don't think it has to be," Rain replied.From up above the non-ceiling of the market, they heard the thunderous roar, and the 
floor shook like an earthquake under their feet.Spielberg hushed past them and got the fuck out of there._____________

The first time was confusing.Mark, in fact, used the words "WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON!?"but as an impartial, polite narrator, I'll use 'confusing'.It was a mugging.Lyla was coming home from her first date after the breakup and the dude pointed the knife and 
said, "Give me the purse, bitch."And Mark, in his underwear, a yellow lipstick of Cheetos around his mouth, materialized in front of them, straight from his living room couch."WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON!?"he uttered, as previously mentioned, which was not intended to, but 
had the effect of, stopping the mugging right away, as the mugger, upon watching a half-naked man materialize 
himself in front of him out of thin air like popcorn bursting into existence from corn except with a person and 
nothingness (Jesus, what a crappy narrator I am), proceeded to politely say "Oh, fuck," and go home (later, I heard, he checked into an institution and got into New Age music and Paulo Coelho, but that's a story for another day).Well, after much debate, Mark and Lyla decided that what had just happened was either collective hallucination or 
undeniable proof that the universe was fundamentally different than humanity had been assuming for thousands of years and all human knowledge had just been rendered obsolete and we'd have to start over from the pre-Socratics on.They figured it didn't really matter, because either way they both had lives to get to and shit to do, and decided to get on with their stuff.They parted ways.It was after the third time (the second being another, totally unrelated mugging), when Lyla got trapped in an 
elevator during a power outage and Mark materialized itself once more in front of her, that they figured out that 
the whole thing was a pattern, and that apparently Mark would show up whenever Lyla was, in his words, "in some deep shit or whatever.""So whenever I'm in trouble, you just show up?""Apparently.""Why!?""Gee, Lyla, I don't know, let me check my International Guide to Unexplainable Phenomena.""You're being sarcastic, aren't you?""No, I really have a guide for unexplainable phenomena.""Now you're being sarcastic about being sarcastic, aren't you?""I'll add another layer if you keep bothering me.""God, you're annoying, no wonder I broke up with you.""I broke up with you.""No you didn't.""Internally I did."This continued for something like forty minutes, until the firemen came and rescued them (as, of course, though 
Mark had indeed materialized in front of Lyla to be there in her time of need, he lacked the tools to get them out of 
a stopped elevator.)It started getting suspicious, as far as Mark was concerned, the seventh time Lyla was caught in the middle of a disagreement with drug addicts in the town's worst neighborhood.That's when he started suspecting foul play on her part.All the same, he kept to himself, standing by her side as the crackheads robbed her then him (because, it turns 
out, crackheads are not as easily spooked by people materializing out of thin air as muggers are these guys just 
said "Woah, dude just popped into existence.Let's rob him too!")Then it was a cliff  literally, Lyla standing on the edge of a cliff, about to lose balance, and Mark popped up by her 
side to save her.Then it was a minor car accident.Then a fight with this bitchy girl she knew from high school.Mark decided to say something when he suddenly materialized in front of Lyla inside a warehouse filled to the 
ceiling with towers and towers of cocaine packs and surrounded by angry, machine-gun wielding Brazilian men somewhere deep in the rainforests of South America."Okay, that's it," he said, as soon as he laid eyes on Lyla, tied to a chair in the back of the room, behind some drug stacks."What the hell, Lyla!?""I'm sorry," she said, "I got lost hiking."He got closer to her, untied her, careful not to alert the men patrolling the warehouse just behind the stack of 
cocaine they were pressed against."No you didn't.""Excuse me!?""Look, I'm sorry it didn't work out between us," Mark said, as she got up and rubbed her wrists."But you gotta 
stop putting yourself into dangerous situations just because you want to try to hurt me.""What!?""You don't think I've noticed!?Seven muggings!Random fights!Random cliffs!And now you show up at a drug 
warehouse in South America!?You hate hiking!Come on, Lyla, it's so obvious!You're trying to get me killed!""Who's there!?"came a voice from behind the cocaine stack, because Brazilians speak English when it's convenient for the plot."Is that what you think I'm doing!?"Lyla asked."Well, isn't it!?Why else would you keep putting yourself into these dangerous situat "

"BECAUSE I MISS YOU, YOU IDIOT!"She pushed him."I MISS YOU AND I DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO CALL YOU 
AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN THINK TO SEE YOU FROM TIME TO TIME.""Hey, there's a dude with the girl we caught over here!"One of the drug thugs showed up, pointing the gun."You miss me?"Mark asked, quietly."Yes, you idiot.What, you think I take trips to the rainforest and end up on coke farms by accident?"More men showed up, all wielding machine guns.They pointed."Fuck, why didn't you just say so?""Cause you never seem happy to see me.""THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE ALWAYS ON THE VERGE OF DEATH WHEN I SEE YOU, NOT BECAUSE I STOPPED LOVING 
YOU!""You still love me?""OF COURSE I DO, YOU STUPID BITCH!""Why are you yelling?""BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO DIE!"She looked at the men.Then at Mark."It does look that way.""I'M GONNA KISS YOU NOW.""Okay."She smiled.And they did kiss.And then, of course, the Brazilian drug men opened fire and they died a very bloody, horrible death, but it was kind of romantic, really.I thought so, at least.

"I got it!"Dr. Becker yelled, rising from his chair and throwing his fists in the air."Good, now throw it out," came the low voice from the edge of the room.Becker looked to find an old man wearing 
a black vest and a beret, leaned by the door frame."Who are you?""God," the man replied."And you need to throw those fancy numbers on the fire and forget about them.""Why would I do that?"Becker asked."And you're not God.That's ridiculous.""You just proved mathematically that God exists.Why wouldn't you believe me?"Becker thought about this."I don't know.Force of habit," he said, unsure."Are you really God?""I can make it rain for forty nights, if that helps."The sky out the window grew dark, and thunder and lightning filled the room."No, that's ok," Becker said."I 
believe you.""Good," God said, stepping closer to Becker."Now to the matter at hand.You have to get rid of these papers.Any 
evidence that I exist must be destroyed.""Why?""Nothing good ever comes from telling people there is a God," God said."Believe me, ask my son.""Jesus?""No, Dylan," God replied."Why do people keep mentioning this Jesus person to me?""What happen to your son Dylan?""He was crucified.""Really?""Yes, he was a teacher at the Harvard School of Philosophy.Tried to defend God's existence on a seminar against Richard Dawkins.Completely destroyed his career.""So metaphorically crucified?""Of course!Who would actually crucify someone?"Becker shook his head."Never mind.Why shouldn't I tell people you exist?"God pulled a chair and sat across from Becker."Trust me, Doctor, no one wants to know I exist.It's like you're throwing a party and your parents come home early.You know?It ruins the fun.""But but people have to know about God.They have to!""Why?So they can start doing good out of fear of me?That's bullshit.And it won't get them in heaven anyway, 
you gotta do good because you want to do good.Selflessly.Otherwise it doesn't work.""But no one does anything selflessly," Becker replied."At the very least you feel good when you do good, and that's 
kind of selfish by nature, isn't it?""Yeah, why do you think all my consoles only have one controller?It's pretty lonely up in heaven."Becker considered this.Then he went on."Still you can't just expect me to find this out and then never reveal it to the world!This is a major discovery!""Are you telling me what to do?"God asked, frowning."No, I  well, I'm suggesting.I'm saying we shouldn't lie to the world.They deserve to know.""Look, Doctor, you have no idea the kind of trouble this information would cause.First of all, right off the bat, your theory proves God is real, but it doesn't say which one.""So?""So the first thing they're going to ask me is which God I am.The Old Testament God?Allah?Odin?Zeus?""Well which one are you?"God rolled his eyes."I'm starting World War Three the second I answer this question.""Did any religion get it right, at least?""No, sorry..." God looked up, thoughtful."Actually, there was this tribe in southern Asia... they had it right.But it was only about fifty people, and they all died of dysentery by the end of the fourteenth century."Becker bit his lips."But still, people need to know the universe has an explanation!That there is a higher power!That there is meaning to our futile and hopeless transitory existence!""Where did you get all that?"God asked, chuckling."All you found out is there is a God.I don't know about the rest.""Well I assumed the whole thing came in a bundle."Now God openly laughed."Oh my Me, no!I mean I made the universe, but I have no idea what the meaning of it is!Did you ever stopped to consider that I didn't make myself?That someone had to make me for me to make the 
universe?And then, if that's true, someone would also have had to make that deity too?And then well, you see where I'm going.""Towards painful existential despair like the rest of us.""Oh yes, and I can't even kill myself over it.I've got kids to raise."Becker sighed."So what?I just throw these papers out and live the rest of my life pretending there is no God?""Is that really that different than your usual schedule?""Good point" Becker looked up."Still now I know there's a God.I'll feel awkward "

" banging hookers?""reading Nietzsche."God nodded."Yeah, that guy never got over me.He's still moping away in heaven.""He went to heaven?""Look, Dr. Becker, in the end, I can't really force your hand.You can do whatever you want, you have free will.""Really?""No, of course not, human beings are made of the same matter as everything else in the universe, so you follow the 
same rules of cause and effect.Free will is an illusory side-effect of the overgrowing of your monkey brains to a point where it developed self-awareness.""Fuck, I knew it," Becker replied, sadly."Though that does make me feel better about the day I lost my virginity.""But you *think* you have free will, so you think you can make the decision and I can't stop you if you think you decided to do it.All I'm saying is it won't help people get into heaven it won't solve their existential dilemmas and it will definitely cause World War Three and the ultimate death of every person ever."Becker thought about this.Then he raised his finger."But if I'm really just a product of a chain reaction of cause and effect like everything else in the universe, you already know what I'll decide, won't you?"God rolled his eyes again, getting up from the chair."I bet you were the kind of student who reminded the teacher 
of homework at the end of class."Becker didn't say anything."Anyway think it over I gotta go.""Wait!"Becker got up too."Will I see you again?""Yes," God replied, turning a serious look at Becker."In every summer breeze.In every soft, child-like voice chanting songs about yesterdays.In every splash of the ocean and in every lover's stare."Becker held God's gaze."Look, just call me if you need me," God said, dropping the act and pushing a business card in Becker's hand."Ciao!"In a puff of white smoke, the old man vanished, leaving Becker alone holding the card.Slowly, Becker went back to his chair.He lowered his eyes to his paper again.It was all there.All the answers.The irrefutable proof that the universe had a reason for being  a higher power  a 
God.How could he possibly not --

"Sorry, sorry!"God materialized himself by the window, rushing in fast steps towards Becker."I can't leave this to chance."He grabbed Becker's papers, stuff them all in his mouth and swallowed whole."I'm really, really sorry.Anyway, bye!"And then disappeared again.Becker sat for a long time in silence.Then he got up.Slowly, he made way to the cabinet by the bedroom door.He grabbed a glass.He dropped two ice cubes in the glass.He poured the scotch.Then he got drunk for the rest of his life.

*Well, I suppose there's no way to go but down now,* Michael thought, fishing for the flashlight in his backpack and restarting the climb down.It went on for at least ten minutes, *clenck, clenck, clenck* with no sign of a bottom.Finally, Michael's feet touched something other than metal steps.He pointed his flashlight down to confirm it: it was dirt.He had reached the bottom at last.He pulled the flashlight from his mouth and scanned his surroundings.Dirt walls enclosed the space all around except for a passageway directly in front of the ladder.The tunnel seemed to carry on that way  ahead instead of down now.With one hand on the grip of the .45 and the other guiding the flashlight, Michael started down the path.It was narrow, and here and there, Michael's broad shoulders would brush against the walls.A constant dripping sound seemed to follow him around, growing louder, then quieter, then louder then quieter again with each turn of the way.Twice, Michael  happened by what appeared to be a fork on the road, splitting the tunnel into two separate passageways.Both times, though, one of the paths lead to a dead end, forcing Michael to return and go the other way.He tried his Pad.It was working, but the communication level was at zero.This meant that he couldn't talk to base or Zara.He could record messages and program the Pad to send them, but it wouldn't do so until it had found a signal.Michael thought of Nova, and how she mentioned in her last video that she couldn't communicate with base live too, and that that was why she had sent a video log.Michael shook the thought from his mind and kept going.&nbsp;

For about twenty minutes, the way carried without any incident.If it wasn't for the fact that he hadn't seen the steps he had come down from again, Michael would have thought he was walking in circles.The tunnel looked the same wherever he pointed his lantern.A moist, dirty, rocky passageway that seemed to snake left, right and straight seemingly fore 

He stopped.To his right, he thought he heard something other than the constant dripping sound.Voices.Not childlike, but adults.And not one or two, but the murmur of a crowd.It was very low, but audible.Michael turned back and cast the light on the wall where he thought the noise was coming from.At first, he saw nothing but the irregular clay-like wall of the tunnel.But then, pulling the light up, he saw where the noise was coming from.Just above his head, at the edge of the dirt wall, an opening seemed to lead to a kind of second-floor tunnel.It was not easily reachable, and Michael assumed that whoever built that intersection meant for a ladder to be placed exactly where he was, leading up.But there was no ladder where Michael was.There was, however, ten years of intense physical training in the background of every Special Forces agent, which, as it turned out, served the same purpose.Michael pulled himself up by the edge of the second floor tunnel and rose to his feet.He flashed the light ahead to scrutinize the new environment, expecting it to look the same as the lower level tunnel, because well, most underground tunnels in dead planets tend to look the same.But this tunnel didn't look the same.It was dark and humid and the air was stale, just like the other one.But it led somewhere visible, unlike the other one, which seemed to go on forever into darkness the more Michael walked.This tunnel ended some one hundred meters in front of Michael, in a circular opening that lead to something he couldn't quite make.But there was light there.There was light, and the voices were coming from there.Still clutching to his pistol, Michael began the walk down the tunnel.The opening on the far end grew larger the more he walked, and the voices grew louder.He couldn't make what they were saying, but he could tell there were a lot of people talking.North of one hundred, by the sound.He kept going.With each step, the image of what was on end of the tunnel seemed to become a little clearer.First he saw golden lights dancing.Fire, hanging from a wall of dirt like the tunnel walls, but on a far end of what looked like an empty space.The tunnel seemed to end in a hole in a sort of a gigantic wall facing another gigantic wall with a deep gap in between them, like the end of a long sewer pipe.Michael finally reached the opening, and his mouth fell open.He leaned against the wall to avoid being seen and gave his mind time to process what exactly was happening in front of him.The tunnel *did* end on a hole in the wall, but there was a simple wooden suspension bridge leading from where the tunnel ended to a whole world.It was a wide, bright open space; a circular chamber with holes encrusted on the wall all along at all sides, just like the one he was standing on the edge of.From the rim of every hole, a different suspension bridge would extend all the way through the air across to another hole on the opposite side, giving the place the aspect of a massive spider web.The place was *huge*.Looking up, Michael couldn't see the ceiling above, and neither the ground down below.Cloaked figures walked up and down the suspension bridges and disappeared and appeared from every hole at every second.Down under, at the edge of where Michael's eyes could see, some rudimentary  but quite big  clay structures clutched themselves to the walls like castles of melted candle wax, seemingly defying gravity.Up above, more bridges fought for space with suspended wooden platforms, dangling dangerously from thick cables that disappeared upwards into a fog.From up close where Michael was standing, the voices were now loud and echoed like a busy market square.An anthill for people.An underground city."Goer hyn!"The voice came like a grunt in a foreign language, from behind Michael.He turned and pulled his pistol in a single movement, but the hands were already grabbing him and pulling his arms behind his back.Someone took his pistol away, and he was turned against the wall."Who are you?What's going on?"Michael yelled, feeling heavy hands pushing his face against the dirt.More grunts followed.There were three distinct voices behind Michael.None of them were speaking any language he'd ever heard before.Suddenly, the hands pulled his head back, and a black bag was pushed over his head.______________

Uno was the little girl, racing down the broken down, fuming remains of Prague as the city 
fell, as the army marched, as the people panicked while the TV screens said don't panic.He was the little girl holding her father's hand, and when her father stopped, panting, out 
of breath, and the sky was dark with dust and the father asked, "Are you okay, honey?"Uno smiled and touched his forehead.Uno was the man on top of the building in Chicago.He walked down deserted corridors, 
opened door after door until he found the woman, barricading behind office chairs and 
desks and a water cooler.She said, "Are you one of them?"Uno said he wasn't.He got 
close.She trusted him.He touched her forehead.Uno was a tall woman standing on the doorstep of an old apartment in downtown 
Moscow.He was a tall woman with eyes down to a an old couple embracing in bed, the 
world below them screaming and blowing and catching fire, the sky out the window 
blurred by aircrafts, bombers, helicopters, the air viscous with ambulance sirens.The old 
couple kept their eyes on each other as Uno stepped closer, and the man whispered, 
"Don't look," and the woman cried, and Uno got closer and the man whispered, "I love 
you," and the old lady whispered that she loved him too and they both pressed their eyes 
shut and way in the distance the thick roar of a building collapse reached them like a faint 
holler, a dog bark in a dream, like the fall of something monstrous and alien in a land 
beyond lands, and Uno towered over the couple and narrowed his eyes at them.They 
pressed their hands tight.They breathed in deep.The woman let out a faint and high pitched gasp.Uno touched their foreheads.&nbsp;



Back at the farmhouse, Uno was everyone in the family.He carried Noah out the house, 
everyone else inside, and he stopped by the little dirt path leading to the fence and 
beyond to the road.Dawn was coming, a faint hue of orange over the brown hills lumping 
against the sky.He watched.He was 93% of the world now.Now he was 95.Now he was 98.Now it was over, and a booming silence befell upon the world, and he heard it everywhere 
at once, in every corner of the land, behind and above and under every house and 
building and highway and tree there was Uno, listening to nothing, to this great stillness 
that took over, this haunting and heavy absence of life.He was a little bit closer to being the whole universe now.One planet closer.The sun broke over the brown hills and burned his pupils.He was alone.He didn't feel any closer to the answers he was looking for:

*Why am I here?Why am I alive?Why do I feel, why do I know, why do I taste and see 
and hear?*

He felt sorry for humans because they died, and dying was horrible, but he felt sorry for himself too, because not dying was an eternal limbo, was an endless chain of questioning, of doubt, of bemusement turned horror.Why everything?Why?Why?There had to be a purpose for all things.There had to.A figure shaped itself against the orange sunrise, stumbling beyond the fence towards him.Uno watched as it grew closer in staggering steps.It was a man.A fat man in a white sleeveless shirt.Disheveled hair.Dirty.Smiling.Uno was not that man."Heyooo!"the man hollered, as he approached him."You daddy home!?"Uno dragged Noah closer to the man.The man stumbled and fell, and laughed and leaned 
against the wooden fence.Uno towered over him."Who are you?""Name's Stanley," the man said."I'm a bit on the drunken side, I'll tell ya kid, but I ain't no 
bum.Is your daddy or mommy home?I could use a shower and a meal, if you folks are 
Christian enough.""Where were you?"Uno asked, intrigued."These last few days.""What's that now?""Didn't you hear about what happened?About the world?""Something happened to the world?"The man chuckled."Son, I've been holed up in 
Terry's Tavern for the past five days.We was fishing before, and then when the bar was 
closing Ol' Terry gave me the keys, told me to add my drinks to my tab and close the door 
behind me.Only I stayed until morning, and Ol'Terry never showed up."The man chuckled."So I stayed some more.And more.Five days total.I'll tell you, he's got quite a detective 
novel collection.Quite a booze collection too."The man hiccupped and smiled."You've been inside a bar getting drunk and reading detective novels by yourself for the past five days?""Yup.No TVs at Terry's too, just the PI books, and I don't carry myself one of them 
smartphones.So whatever it is that's happened to the world, I ain't aware of it."He hiccupped again, then smiled, then spat."Kid, you gonna stare at me all day or are you gonna get your parents to cook me a nice 
meal?"The universe.It was the loneliest place Uno had ever known.By far.It was also the weirdest."Aah, whatever.I'm going back to Terry's.Dumb ass kid."The man pulled himself up with 
difficulty, sniffed and then turned back.Uno watched him.The man staggered his way back down the road and towards the rising sun.Twice he tripped on his own leg and almost fell.Twice he laughed at himself.Uno thought about going after him.Turning him.But didn't.He let the man go.Then he heard the man.Way in the distance, now just a staggering shadow against the morning sky.The man chortled."Ah, man, this life."

"I'm sorry to bring you here like this.""Not at all, my dear boy.Not at all.""But, you see, I have to know I have to know, and you're the only one "

"I get it," the old man interrupted me.He puffed his cheeks weakly, like it took him great effort just to breathe, 
and then he leaned back against the armchair and his eyes turned to the crackling of the fireplace."Ask away.""Well it's pretty simple, actually."I leaned forward."What's it like?"His eyes turned to me, and he almost smiled.*"What's it like?"*

"Yeah.Life.Growing up.Being old."I paused."Well, not that I'm calling you old, I just "

"It's okay, dear boy," he laughed."I am old.That's why you brought me here."I said nothing.He arranged himself on the armchair like he had all the time in the world.Then his eyes went up to 
me again."It's hard."I waited.I knew he wasn't done."It's the hardest thing you'll ever have to do, actually" he continued."Harder than building all this fancy equipment you've built.Harder than studying all you've studied.Harder than winning all these scientific awards you've won so far."He chuckled."Nothing prepares you for it.""What makes it hard?"I asked."Is it the responsibilities?The body decaying?What makes growing up so hard?""No.It's not the responsibilities.Growing up is like looking both ways before you cross the street, then getting hit by an airplane."He lowered his head as if to put his thoughts together, then continued."It's the things you don't expect that catch you by surprise.Sure, it's scary to have a kid, and to get married, and to ask your boss for a promotion, and all these grown-up stuff we have to *pretend* we know how to do.""Pretend?"He seemed surprised."Yes, pretend.No one really grows up, of course.We put on a face to the world, but at home, three in the morning, all alone watching TV, you're still sixteen.All of us are."He shook his head."There's nothing more heartbreaking than being a real person and sitting down in front of another real person, and then both of you have to act like fake people.You sit across from someone two years older than you in a job interview and you both say 'Hello, sir' and 'Yes, I also think the Dow Jones has been fluctuating dangerously this last few days' and 'Oh, absolutely, the 405 is a nightmare this time of day'.And all along you *know* you both laugh at poop jokes and fart sounds and you have all these hobbies and interests and you curse and say fuck and shit and asshole.You're real people.But you act like robots.You have to put on the face, and they have to put on a face, and you have to pretend that nothing in life is ever fun, everything is productivity and seriousness.""Is that what makes it hard?"I asked."That everyone's just faking their way through adulthood?""No.No, that's expected.It sucks, but we all know what we're getting into."He sighed."No, what catches you by 
surprise are the little things about growing up.It's being stuck in traffic and remembering a day.Any day.A locker 
room conversation in high school.A teacher.A friend of a friend.Something that happened long enough ago that 
it could order its own drink.It sneaks up on you, and you look at yourself in the rear view and you think, my 
God where did it go?When did I become so old?"I remember college like it was yesterday.I remember my girlfriends and my friends and they used to drink and 
talk about sex and hanging out and now they all eat oatmeal and go to funerals.And I do that to, and I *like* all of that.Well, not going to funerals, but oatmeal.Soap operas.Going to bed at nine.I like it.""So what's the problem?""The problem is I'm still the sixteen year old.I'm still the college kid.My needs and wants have changed, and my 
body has changed, and my mind has changed, in a way, but *I* didn't change.I'm still putting on a face.So when 
these thoughts sneak up on me  when a flash of a college party or a roadtrip or the feeling of falling asleep in the 
back of my Dad's car wells up on me it breaks me.It breaks me because I don't think of it fondly.I don't look at 
that young kid with affection and nostalgia, I look at him with envy.Envy, because he's got all of that ahead of him 
still, and he doesn't even know how lucky he is.He's me, we're the same  but he's got the good looks and the 
health and all the years ahead of him, and I'm wasting away in an old apartment.And I hate that kid so much.Every time he sneaks up on me I hate him more."I looked down, then up."What about family?Kids?""They are great.They are amazing.But they go away.They're not *you*.In the end, you raise your sons and 
daughters for the world, not for yourself.They have to fall asleep in the back of *my* car, and go to *their* college parties and all that they don't exist for my benefit.No one exists for my benefit but myself.And I'm much too old to do anything about it."I swallowed dry and averted my eyes to the fireplace.The old man leaned forward."We always get the feeling that 
the good old days are either behind us or ahead of us.They're never our own days.We were always born just a 
bit too late to go to Woodstock or to see Nirvana live or to see the Berlin Wall fall or to party Great Gatsby style in the 20's.And then we get old and we realize we were born too soon to see the wonders of technology and the world reshaping and blooming into something new and exciting.But the truth is, our Woodstocks were happening all around us as we grew.Our new and exciting world was some old guy's boring present, and our past will be some spoiled, arrogant kid's 'Good old days'.We were just too stupid to realize it when it mattered.So we let it slide away.And then we ended up like me  sad and resentful of our younger selves for all they can still do and we can't."Finally, I got up.I went to the old man and I knelt in front of him."I'm sorry I brought you over.""It's okay," he said."I knew you would.After all, I did it, sixty years ago."I looked at my own eyes.Despite the wrinkles around them, they still looked pretty much the same.The old man 
shook his head and sniffed a tear away."Now let's go back to your lab so you can send me back to my own time, 
so I can hate you in peace."I hugged my own eighty year old version and leaned away and nodded."I'll enjoy it," I said."And I'll know I'm living in the good old days, I promise."He got up with difficulty."No, you won't," he said."The good old days are only ever good when they're gone.That's what makes them good.When you're living through them, they're just...days."He slow-stepped ahead of me towards the lab.Then he spoke without turning his head: "And days go by really fast, man.They go by really fast."

The bird shit fell straight to my shoulder, painting a black and white drip down the sleeve of my new shirt."Perfect!"I said, looking up at the sky."Just perfect.Thank you, God!Thank you so much for that!I was on my 
way to a job interview!"I felt a bump on my stomach, coming from the inside out.In a second, I felt incredibly sick, like I might throw up 
the whole universe.My eyelids went down and I fell to my knees.My head hit the curb.&nbsp;

When I came to my senses I was surrounded by people in brown robes, Eyes Wide Shut style.I was in a metal chair, and the robed dudes were sitting in a wide circle around me.The ceiling was high over my head and the air felt cold and smelled of dust.I was in a warehouse."What the fuck is going on now?"I asked, looking around."Silence, newcomer," one of the robed figures bellowed.I couldn't see their faces."Perfect!Just perfect!"I said."Now I was kidnapped by a secret cult!Fucking genius, universe!Thanks again!"One of the figures rose on its feet, grabbed a tiki torch from its side and took fast steps towards me."Oh, and they have fire!"I said, eyes up to the sky."They're gonna burn me and shit!I swear to God, ever since 
Janine left me it's been "

"This is why you are here," the figure said, in a low voice.I turned my eyes down to the figure.I could make a bearded chin under the hood, but no more than that."You guys look like extras in a Mortal Kombat movie," I said.A soft murmur ran through the room.The figure took another step towards me."You have achieved master level.""What's that?"I asked.The figure took yet another step and removed his hood.He was in his fifties.Strong jawline.Big blue eyes."You 
are now a master on the art of bitching," he said."Come again?""Upon completing ten thousand hours of training, the chosen ones are granted access to the inner circle of light," he 
said calmly."It is not our duty to tell you *what* to train.The pupil must decide this themselves.And you have 
chosen 'bitching'.""God damn it, fuck my life"

"Precisely," the figure continued."You have now bitched about your life for ten thousand hours.You are a master of 
bitching, and, as such, are allowed into the circle of inner light.""Thought it was inner circle of light."The bearded man's eyes straightened."I am not a master of patience, mind you" he said, in a threatening voice."So what?"I said."I get to join the clan?What do you guys do here all day?""We are silent heroes," the man continued."We save the world from harm with our powers.""Powers?What's your power?"The man cleared his throat."I I watch football games."I raised my eyebrows."You watch football games?""Yes.I have watched ten thousand hours of football games, and thus I have become a master spectator of the 
sport.It is not what I would have chosen to do, had I known of the society early on, but "

"Didn't we discuss this already, Earl?"Came a voice from behind me."Stick to the approved script with the new 
kid.""It's easy for you to say, you mastered sword fighting," the man called Earl replied.He turned to me."Be that as it 
may.I can spot anything in a football match in a matter of seconds.I have successfully stopped three attempted 
bombings at football stadiums.One look at the TV screen and I know what everyone is doing."I nodded."Ok and what does bitching superpowers look like?""That" the man said, eyes down on me, "is what you are here to find out."He turned back."Bring the prisoner!"Two figures in robe rose from their seats and disappeared in the darkness behind them.A second later they were 
back, carrying tiki torches with one hand, a man in shackles in the middle of them.They dragged the man all the way to the center of the circle and dropped him on his knees in front of me."This is Sid," Earl the bearded guy said."He is a murderer.He has killed eight prostitutes in the last twelve 
months, and no one will arrest him because his father is an influential politician in the country he comes from."Uh-hum," I said, looking down at Sid.He looked up at me in anger and spat on the floor.Earl took a step forward, standing between me and Sid.The tiki torch's fire over my head warmed the right side of 
my face."Now" Earl said, looking from Sid to me."Bitch."The robed figures all rose to their feet and stepped closer.The circle closed in."Bitch... bitch... bitch," they chanted.I studied Sid's dirty face.He was breathing fast, grunting in anger."Ok" I said.I thought about it.Then, "I always forget to take out the seasoning package of my instant ramen before dumping the whole thing into boiling water.And then I have to try and fish the packet out with two spoons like an idiot, and it makes me mad."For a second, nothing happened.Then Sid's eyes went wide.Then wider.Then he opened his mouth and water 
started coming out of it.Boiling water.Sid screamed.Bubbling, steaming water poured from his nose.His eyes.From his ears, two packets of chicken seasoning sprouted out and fell to the floor.Sid screamed and screamed and fell.Cooked Ramen sprouted from his pores, painted red in blood.He let out a final yell, coughed a Louisiana Spicy 
packet and fell silent.I looked from his dead body to Earl to the other robed figures, who were all standing in awe."Cool" I said, smiling for the first time that week.

"Ok, so let's get this straight," Mr. Gibson says from the couch, looking up at me and 
Kathy (that's the waitress)."We're all "

"Hang on!"I say, fast-stepping to the liquor cabinet."Can I?"I ask Mr. Gibson."Make yourself at home."I grab four bottles of vodka and two bottles of scotch.Hey, you!So, yeah, there's this too: I don't die from drinking or doing drugs, so I do a bunch of those.Like a *real* bunch.Like I dropped Wild Bill under the table in Deadwood once in a drinking contest and I was barely buzzed.I place the bottles on the coffee table.Kathy goes for one.Mr. Gibson for another.Seems alcoholism runs in the immortality genes."All right," Mr. Gibson starts again."We're all here and we're all immortal.""Yes," I say."Yes," Kathy says.(I couldnt' have said 'Yes, we both say'?Jesus, I really need some classes in this.)"And none of us knew there were immortal people in the world for thousands of years, and then suddenly on the same day the three of us meet in the same small town in California.""Yes," I say."Looks that way," Kathy says."Is it me or is something fishy going on?""That's what I said when Jesus multiplied the "

"Shut up.""Sorry."(Fishes.I was gonna say fishes.Because he said 'fishy'.You get it?Did you get it?")"Something fishy's going on, all right," Kathy says."Just last night a customer was in the diner.I didn't pay him much mind when he got there, but when he was about to leave I thought I remembered his face from somewhere."She looks from me to Mr. Gibson.Then she takes a big sip of her vodka."I've seen him before.""Where?""Don't remember," Kathy says."But I do remember it wasn't in this century."I sit by Mr. Gibson's side on the couch, running my hand through my hair."So four immortals, all in the same town at the same time that *is* weird."We exchange glances.Kathy sits on the other couch.We exchange more glances.(Did you know that Buddha was very self-conscious about his nose, in his early teens?That's part of the reason he decided to back away from everything and find enlightenment, he told me.)"So what do we do?You guys wanna find this fourth guy?"Kathy asks."Yeah" Mr. Gibson says.Then he looks at the bottles."But I've never spent any time with anyone else that's immortal"

"Yeah, me neither" I say.Kathy looks from me to Mr. Gibson."What are you proposing?"Mr. Gibson gets up.He goes for his liquor cabinet and takes five more bottles from it and brings them to the coffee table."I'm proposing historical figures drinking game.We can worry about all that shit tomorrow at hangover time."Kathy chuckles.Then she turns to look at me."I'm game," I say, dead serious.The smile fades on her lips.She grabs a second bottle and pulls the cork with her teeth.She spits the cork to the side.She grins.She winks.She takes a sip.She cleans her mouth.Jesus, that's a lot of sentences starting with 'she'.She looks up at us."You're on."__________________

"You want in on this?"the Asian zombie dude's voice rings inside my head, as he lifts his blood covered face from the carcass of what looks like a small child."No, thanks," I tell him, forcing a smile."I'm vegan."The number of times I had to say that I mean, I get it, we're zombies, we need to feed, we're evil, blah, blah, 
blah

But *come on*!We can eat animals!Cows and shit.Hell, I've eaten dogs.I don't feel good about it, but I have.But humans These guys act like it's no big deal I can't bring myself to do it."Hippie bitch," the Asian zombie says, turning back to face his carcass.I roll my eyes, making way back to the streets.God, I'm hungry.__________________

Ok, first thing about being a zombie I didn't realize: it's slow.I can't run.I can't even walk, I have to do this silly 
penguin walk everywhere I go.It's exhausting.I bounce my way down Hollywood Boulevard, brushing past other zombies, turned over cars and torn apart billboards of old TV shows and all that crap.I gotta find food.I mean, there's food around, sure, but it's like I said

Second thing about being a zombie I didn't realize: I still think.I can't bring myself to kill a freaking mailman.These guys around me, some of them are way too sick already, they don't even communicate anymore, I doubt they can think straight.Others  like the Asian dude  they are still rational, but they don't give a shit.Me?I turned less than a month ago.I still have all my brain activity intact.I don't know how long it's going to last, 
but I can tell you for sure, at least for now, I'm not killing any 

"Hey, sweetie."I turn around to face a group of zombies in Abercrombie and Fitch ripped shirts, watching me from the front of an 
abandoned McDonalds."What are you doing browsing around like this?Wanna party with us?"The voices are all in my head, that's how we talk.That's third thing about being a zombie: You can only talk to 
other zombies.And zombies suck.I penguin my way past the McDonalds, ignoring the zombiedouches and stepping into what I think is what's left of the Hollywood and Highland Mall."Come on, princess!Come back!"I hear their voices fading in my head, as I step past a huge sign reading 
OMINGDALES.Jesus, it's boring, walking like this.I look around.Does this place have a food court?A Pet store?Anything I can eat that doesn't *think*?I keep bouncing my way deeper and deeper inside the mall, scanning left and right.Nothing.Dear God, I'm so 
hungry I think I might --

"Back off!"I look to my left.Just under an escalator, a half-open door reads "STORAGE ROOM".It's dark inside.*Huh*

"I said back off!"Squinting, I'm able to make out a human figure.A bit out of shape, and carrying what looks to be a shotgun.The figure takes a step forward, and a young man, not more than seventeen, comes to light."Don't take another 
step!"*Dude, I wouldn't have even seen you if you hadn't said anything.*

"I'm serious, I'll shoot!"He's holding his shotgun like Britney Spears would hold an Erlenmeyer flask, and he's got a piece of cloth tied 
around his forehead.*Zombie nerds,* I think, rolling my eyes and resuming my penguin walk towards the food court."Yeah, that's right!"I hear his voice."Fucking zombies all "

But then I hear it, inside my head, "Hey, there's a dude in there!"And another voice, "Come on!Right there!"I turn back to find the douchezombies making way inside the mall.*You know what?This is not my problem,* I think, trying to ignore the sound of approaching zombie steps behind me.I keep walking."Over there!"Comes the voice inside my head again."Back you devils!"I hear the zombie nerd scream, behind me.*Come on, a Lord of the Ring's quote?*

This kid is going to die.I hear the sound of the shotgun clicking.All right he can defend himself.Then it clicks again.And again."Oh, man, I forgot the shells!""Get him, get him!Oh, he's fat, he'll last a couple of days!"I stop, rolling my eyes again.Shit."All right, stop, fuckfaces," I say, turning back.The zombies have the shotgun boy cornered against his sad little 
storage room door, with the largest one approaching, hands raised in front of his chest likea zombie."Look!it's princess death," the large one replies, turning to face me."How's it going, sweetheart?"I penguin-walk my way to them."Leave the boy alone."They laugh.I figure this must look very weird to zombienerd over there, watching four zombies look at each other 
in silence."Come on, join us," large zombie says."We'll let you have his belly.""Drop it and leave," I say, throwing a serious look his way."Fuck off," another one says, and they charge against the boy again."Oh, shit!"zombienerd cries, dropping to the floor and pressing his eyes closed.I charge, grabbing the largest one by the neck and tearing his head from the rest of his body with a single pull.I throw the lifeless (not that it was exactly life*full* before, but whatever) head behind my shoulder and turn to the others."Holy shit!"one of the friends say, backing away."This bitch is crazy!"I bite onto the dude's face, chewing until I tear half of it away and spitting an eyeball on the floor.He falls down.Zombiedouche number three is all wide-eyes at me now, shaking from feet to bloody, surfer hair.Oh, yes, zombie fact number four: If you only eat human meat and drink human blood, you're only as strong as 
humans.If you eat animals, on the other hand

"Get lost, asshole."I'm a badass, is my point.The zombie turns back and, fast as he can, starts penguin away from me.Zombienerd is shaking and teary-eyed, watching me from the floor."Please don't eat me."I sigh, at least internally, and I offer him my hand.He backs away."Just take it, idiot," I say, inside my head."I'm not going to eat you."Still trembling, he reaches out, and I help him up."Are you going to eat me?"he asks, hand still on mine."No, you fucktard," I reply."I'm going to get you somewhere safe.Come on."God, I hope I stop thinking soon.______________________

Give a man enough time and he can build anything.I wasn't sure how to start this story.It was between this and 'give a man enough time and he'll go bananas and do 
really weird stuff'.Not much of a ring to that second one, so I went with the first.Anyway, the first thousand years weren't that bad.I pretty soon realized the warden was also immortal, and he 
realized the same about me, and we became friends."Can you, like, let me out of prison when everyone in the world dies?"I asked, those first few years."That technically would count as a life sentence, right?And no one would know cause everyone who knew I was sentenced to life would be dead already.""Sorry," the warden said."Rules are rules."My luck, right?The only other immortal person on the planet is my warden, and is a goody-good.So he made it his mission to ensure that my life sentence was served.In his defense, immortality is insanely 
boring, so I guess I became his project.Something to do.Fill your days.Life makes no sense.It doesn't matter.Anyway.After the fall of the Roman Empire things got boring.The warden would visit me often and we'd play cards and 
games and talk about politics and world affairs."What do you think of this feudalism thing?""It's a fad.Won't last."Then, later:

"This Renaissance stuff is really strong lately, right?""Kids.It'll pass."We'd talk about people.Celebrities."What's up with the Newton guy, huh?""Oh, please, give me a break.Gravity.Yeah, invisible forces pushing and pulling us.Sounds like religion to me."And:

"This Napoleon guy sure looks like he means business."And:

"This Black Plague thing is really something, huh?Hope we don't get it.""Tell me about it.Here, I brought you a pet rat from the sewers.""Aww, that's sweet."And so on and so forth.After the Third World War there was a brief period of seven thousand years when we didn't speak (he took the aliens' side while I remained faithful to our kind the humans).(To be fair, the aliens were right, with their whole 'universal-peace' project, and we exterminated them for no good reason.... but, like...I'm human, you know?What was I supposed to do.)(I do feel guilty, though.)We became friends again after the explosion of the sun, on the interstellar living facility."How many people live here?"I asked.I wasn't allowed to leave the facility prison, so I didn't know how many had 
escaped Earth."About a million.""Wow that's like Greek Empire numbers.""We sure shrank."We started on the Project around the end of the Seventh Age (mankind started counting time in Ages instead of years on account of the whole sun-exploding business).Worked on it all through the remaining days of mankind and the Others.All living things perishing around us.The warden started spending more and more time in the cell with me.He slept there often.When all was cold and barren and lifeless but for us, when all was dark but the light inside my cell and him and I were all there was left gliding through the void, we finished it.Minutes to go until the end.Heat death.Complete nothingness.The end of the world.Me and the Warden.And our project.A tiny little sphere, floating between us."You think it'll work?""We worked on it for billions of years," I said."It better work."He looked down at the model universe floating between us.All the same programing, the same coding.Helium, 
carbon, matter, energy, the forces gravity, electromagnetism.We built a universe inside that cell.And it floated between us."Hey," the warden said."It's deterministic, right?This universe?"Outside, the universe blackened and darkened and the light inside the cell grew dimmer, and I could feel myself and 
the warden fading, slowly, finally.Life is a joke."Yeah.""So change the setting at the big bang, just a tweak.Can you do it?"Silence.Darkness.Empty.We were dying at last.Horribly.Beautifully.Dying."Yeah.Change what?""Make it so when there's life" The warden smiled."There'll be two immortal dudes."I shook my head.I smiled at the warden.Then I tweaked my universe and set it in motion, and all was dark and the 
world ended.And then it was born again.

"All your debts?""Yes, all my debts."Satan looked the boy up and down."You're fourteen.""My debts aren't financial.""Nononono, I am *not* getting sucked into another unresolved truth or dare situation.I've learned my lesson with Caligula.""It's nothing to do with truth or dare.Who's Caligula?""This ancient dude who liked orgies.""Who's Orgies?""Orgies is not a person, it's " Satan stopped himself."What's the wish, kid?"The kid paced around the pentagram he had drawn in chalk, one hand clasping his wrist behind him like some sort 
of James Bond villain."I have very particular debts.That I need paid.Debts with *Greg*."The name slipped out 
of his mouth like oil."Okay," Satan said.It wasn't ideal, but what the hell?The glory days of deals with the devil had died with Faust.These days he took what he could get."All right.Tell me what kind of debts these are."&nbsp;

They stepped out of the bedroom and a voice immediately reached them."Took you long enough!"Satan stopped, but the boy kept going towards the living room, where four other boys his age sat around a 
wooden table."This is my friend the Devil."The kid said, with a wave back at Satan."He's here to pay my debts."Satan looked around the pimpled-ridden faces and half-filled Mountain Dew glasses on the table.He stepped 
closer."What in the world " his eyes stopped on the Monopoly board."Oh."The boy came back, took his hand and dragged him closer to the board."So I'd like to pay for my stop in Park Place.In addition to that, I'll be adding hotels to Pennsylvania Ave *and* to North Carolina Ave. Also houses in all the red properties.""Dude," Satan started, tired."You can't do that!"The tallest of the other kids intervened."Yes I can, Greg," the kid replied, smiling."Now, please," he said, turning to Satan."I gave you my soul, didn't I?Do your job.""Kid," Satan started, trying not to roll his eyes, "do you really wanna waste your soul on a board game?I mean, I " He sighed."I can't stop you, but this is *really* stupid and you'll regret it.Hell is very unpleasant.""Just do it!""That's cheating!"the kid called Greg bellowed, as Satan puffed his cheeks and snapped his fingers, producing a 
wad of fake Monopoly money out of thin air."There's nothing in the rules that says selling your soul to Satan is not allowed!"the kid yelled back."I checked!""Well, in that case," Greg replied, as Satan turned around to leave, "I want to sell my soul too!""Oh, for the love of God," Satan cried, stopping on his spot."I want all the companies!*And* for Jim to go to jail!""Who's Jim?"The first kid looked up at Satan, hurt."Seriously, dude?I just sold you my soul.""Oh.Right.Jim.""Wait, wait, wait," a third kid added, getting up."I wanna get in on this deal too.""For the love of God kids, stop selling your souls for fake properties!Hell sucks!""No, no, it's nothing to do with the game."Satan paused."What do you want?""Can you heat this for me?"the kid said, raising a plate with a single slice of pepperoni pizza his way."The 
microwave is like all the way in the kitchen and --"

"STOP MAKING FRIVOLOUS REQUESTS IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR SOULS!"Satan bellowed."GOD DAMN IT!""You know what?"Greg said."I change my mind, let Jim win the stupid game.Make mine a pizza too.Meat lovers.""I'M NOT SELLING PIZZAS, I'M HEATING THEM!Wait, what am i saying!?""Hey, Sam, you didn't make your wish yet, ask him for the Ferrari."Satan paused.His eyes darted to the fourth kid, who had, up until then, not partaken in the discussion.*Could he finally have stumbled upon a decent wish-maker?Someone who would trade their soul for something 
worthy?*

"So you want a Ferrari?"Satan asked.The kid nodded."Yes," he said, simply."Model F-40, black, vintage edition, two-thousand and two.I've wanted one for years.""Okay that I can arrange.Are you willing to trade your soul for it?""I am."Satan smiled.Not a wasted trip to Earth after all.The kid smiled in return.He pulled his phone."Hang on, let me see if they still have it."Satan frowned."What are you doing?I can get it for you even if they don't --"

"I'm just checking the Hot Wheels website to see if they still have that model for sale.""Oh fuck you all," Satan said, puffing fire out of his cheeks and setting the house on fire (which, to be fair, did heat the pizza slice, so that was nice.)

"*Gogogogogo!*"

Mark and Sam darted in front, and Buck, after a second's hesitation, decided that if they were gonna get caught by the police or murdered by the Axe Man of the Dial Building, they might as well do it together.He raced along.Sam lead, the path of dust from his phone's light shaking wildly with his steps as he made way further down the corridor.Seemingly all around them, they could hear creaking steps and conversation, the faint voices pitched lower like mumbles by the echoing effect of the building."Is it cops?Is it cops?"Buck asked, trying to keep up with his two friends."No, it's Taylor Swift and she wants your phone number," Mark replied, without turning back."Yes, it's freaking cops, Buck!Keep running, I don't wanna have to drag your ass!"Sam stopped so suddenly Mark hit his nose against his back.Buck, a little ways further behind, stopped in time, panting, hands on his knees."What, what happened?""Shhh!"Sam looked back at them, a finger over his lips for silence.Buck opened his ear.Footsteps, now coming from the front.The voices clearer now:

"Sure they went in?"sounded one, scratchy and low-pitched."That's what Mrs. Norrington said on the phone.""You see?That's what happens when we don't pass medical marijuana already.Kids stuff themselves into abandoned buildings to get baked and risk the roof falling on their heads.And *we* have to get out of the station at freaking midnight to deal with it.""Well it *is* trespassing, Captain.""I know it is trespassing, Ryan, I'm just saying, we " the voice paused."Do you hear that?"Sam turned back.Buck had heard it too.Something rattled softly, just above his heads in the dark.His eyes darted up, but the darkness was almost solid an inch over his eye.Nothing.But the rattle was there -- a soft, rhythmic thud: *tuc, tuc, tuc...*

Slowly, Sam pointed his phone and clicked the light.Buck kept his eye on him.His pupils contracted and his eyes focused.He paused for a second, then looked down at Buck, a very serious look on his face.*Don't scream* he mouthed, without a sound.*What?* Buck mouthed back.*Don't.Scream.*

Buck looked up, careful not to make any noise.The sound was coming from a little wad of white cloth spinning over his head, banging softly on the hollow wall.From that little wad of cloth  like a package  snaked upwards a single thread reflecting the phone's light.Said thread ended on the butt of a spider the size of bowling ball, spinning its web like it wasn't a freaking abomination of the universe.Horror kicked in a few seconds after Buck realized that the wad of cloth spinning an inch over his head was not, in fact, just a wad of cloth, but a dead rat, and that rat had probably just been murdered by the fucking alien now spinning it a full body Gismo-suit in white."I think it's coming from there," the cop's voice sounded, frightfully close.More footsteps.*FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK* Buck mouthed, managing -- God knows how -- to not make any sound.It was Mark who took initiative and, grabbing the phone from Sam's hand, pointed the light towards the other side of the corridor.He scanned until the halo stopped on a rusty door."There!"he whispered, and made for it.Buck didn't hesitate this time.Nothing like a spider prepping a rat meal over your head to suppress that insecurity beta-male genes inside each of us, he thought, before going for it after Mark.Sam followed.They closed the door behind them as careful as they could, and stood listening as the footsteps approached, then distanced themselves."That was close," Sam said, when they felt it was safe to resume breathing."Seriously, fuck Peter Parker," Buck panted."If that's the animal you base yourself on to become a superhero, you have some deep psychological scars and I don't trust you with your powers.""Settle down, Buck," Mark added."You're fine."They turned back to scan the place they were in.A large window teethed with broken glass edges on the far end of the room let in the moonlight, so they could actually see here.They were in a wide space, almost no furniture except for a few archive boxes, some turned over metal cabinets and an old couch.Dust-covered rumble all over the floor."What do you reckon the place was?"Sam asked, flashing his phone around."Office, probably," Mark said, stopping in front of a water cooler with a big hole in the middle."No, you doofus.I meant the room we were in.The one with the dials.""Oh"

Buck stopped by the window and looked out.It was past midnight, and the streets were empty.He kneeled down and sat with his back against the wall under the sill, stuffing his arms inside his shirtsleeves against the cool night air draft."Just a regular room with dials, I guess," Mark ventured."There was nothing regular about that room," Buck said, quietly."Oh, come on, Buck, I've seen you jump-scared by a dragon statue in Skyrim once.""There was something weird about that room, Mark.""Why?Cause the dial moved by itself?It's almost like I don't know we have the technology to make dials move by themselves for hundreds of years!""It wasn't connected to anything.It didn't it didn't look a regular clock moving."Mark shook his head and scoffed, but Sam stopped by his side."I mean didn't you feel *kind* of weird inside that room, Mark?"he asked."Guys a dial moved.That was it!Let's move on!"But Buck caught Sam's eye, and he knew he understood.It wasn't that the dial had moved, or even all the dials themselves.There *was* something about that room, something Buck felt, and now he knew Sam felt too.Like the room itself was a presence.Like it had taken notice of their own presence.Buck got up again.Through the broken window, he saw the small figure of the cops exiting the building and getting into their car, taking off a second later."Whatever," Mark said."I don't even feel like getting high anymore.I'm out of here."He made for the door, knocking the water cooler on his way."Mark, wait for us, come on!"Sam said, catching up."You guys are sissies," Mark said, opening the door, his face back to Buck and Sam."I 
don't "

Mark's head collided against the man's chest, and he bounced back.Buck looked up and froze:

The man's face was obscured in shadow, but he could made out the contours of a very thick beard, broad shoulders, a leather jacket and heavy, knee-high boots.He was looking down at Mark.The glowing tip of a cigarette hovered orange in midair a few inches from his mouth.One of his eyes was completely obscured by the darkness, but the other shone a very faint and milky white."The fuck do you kids thing you're doing messing around with the dials?"he said, in a throaty voice, smoke oozing from his mouth with every word.______

Jim stuck his head between the front seats."Wait, what did you say?"The girl  Annie, apparently  rolled her eyes."Never mind, you wouldn't understand.""Let me guess," Jim ventured."You were going on about your day and then the world *lagged* around you like it was no big deal."Annie froze mid-drag on her cigarette."You noticed it too?""Yeah.It's that Elon Musk thing.It's not tinfoil hat bullshit, apparently."She turned around to face Jim."Dude.Dude.*Duuude*.Yes!I thought I was the only one who had noticed it.""It happened to me too," Jim replied."My girlfriend froze like her ping had gone up a thousand points.""You have a *girlfriend*!?"Annie asked, looking Jim up and down in clear shock.Jim sighed."Sure, the universe is a simulation and your very notion of reality has just been shattered, but *that's* the part you find hard to believe.""What the hell are you two talking about?"The driver intervened."Shut up," Annie said."What do you know about it?"she asked Jim."Not much.Except that Elon Musk apparently found out that our universe is a simulation and cluster-bombed outer space to prove it, and apparently that caused the lag, which, for some reason, didn't affect the two of us."The driver made a left and drove the car up towards the freeway."Hey, guys, I'm gonna need an address at some point."Annie looked from Jim to the driver, annoyed."I told you.Take us to Elon Musk's house.""I don't know where that is.""Just put 'Elon Musk' on Google Maps, see what shows up, dammit!"The driver punched a few words in his smartphone."I got Space X Headquarters, in Hawthorne.""Yeah, that works," Jim said."Take us there.""Was this the first time the lag happened to you?"Annie asked Jim."Yeah.You?"She nodded."Fucking bonkers, man.And I was having the time of my life, too."*Tell me about it,* Jim thought, his mind back at Karen.The driver pulled the car to the right lane, then slowly pulled over to the side of the highway to a full stop."What are you doing?"Annie asked, annoyed."Look, guys, I'm sorry," the driver said."I can't take you there.""Why!?"Annie asked."Don't take this the wrong way, but you guys sound like crazy people.And if you're making me drive  you to this celebrity person's home or whatever to harass him, I could get in trouble.""Oh, for the love of God!"Annie said, blowing smoke in the man's face."You know that's how you get bad reviews on the app, right?""And you can't smoke in the car, too," the driver added.Annie leaned back against her seat, annoyed.She dragged her cigarette again."Please get out," the driver said."Seriously," Jim intervened."We're not crazy.""Then tell me what's going on."Jim sighed.Then he said, "Okay, so I was with Karen Willow, my girlfriend, and then "

"You're dating Karen Willow?"Annie asked, turning back again."Yeah."Jim chuckled."Actually, it's a funny story.I thought I was dreaming, but then when I found out that I was really awake and this was all a virtual reality "

"-- you thought to yourself 'I gotta fix the universe so I can be together with her, right!?"Annie completed."Yes!""Dude, dude, *duuude*, I know!I'm dating Brad Pitt!""Get out of here!""Honest to God, he's in my apartment right now.""That's awesome!""All right, that's it," the driver intervened, pulling his phone."I'm calling the cops.""No, no!We're not crazy, sir," Jim pleaded."If you could just "

"Calling the cops.""Don't call the cops, for real, we "

"Calling the cops.Calling the cops.Calling the cops.Calling the cops.Calling the cops."Jim and Annie exchanged looks."*That* is a good time for a server overload," Annie said, nudging her head towards the looped driver with a crooked smile.She stepped out of the car, made way around it and opened the driver's door."What are you doing?"Jim asked.She unbuckled the driver's seatbelt ("Calling the cops.Calling the cops.Calling the cops."), pulled him out, threw him to the side of the road like she was in Los Santos and climbed in behind the wheel.Jim raised his eyebrows."Okay" he said."I guess it's not robbery if the car doesn't technically exist in the material world.""Exactly," Annie agreed, spitting her cigarette out the window."Now let's go find that weird billionaire guy so I can go back to Mr. Pitt in time for dinner."_______________

"Okay, sit down," God said, lighting a cigarette and crossing his legs."You gotta tell me how you did it.I mean the 
whole thing was a mess and now it's just just"

"The word you're looking for is perfect," I said."The universe is perfect.""Yes.Perfect.""Divine.Wonderful.Flawless.""You've made your point.Now tell me how you did it.""Well okay," I took one of his cigarettes and loaded it between my lips."First of all, I did away with the whole 
determinism bullshit.I mean, what was that about!?""You're kidding!That was like the first rule!""It was crap.I mean you put all of us in the universe and gave us the illusion of free will when really our mind is 
controlled by the brain which is made of matter which follows the fundamental rules of the universe like every other matter.What kind of crap is that?Talk about deceptive.""What did you do then!?How did you replace determinism!?""I gave people actual free will.Turns out if we are free to do what we actually want instead of being tricked by the 
rules of nature to act the way you see fit while only thinking we're free, we're actually quite skillful at living.""But but but then it's chaos!"God shook his head."If the rules of the universe don't control the behavior of 
animals, even sapient ones like humans, what does!?""Just us."God seemed confused."But then that just means that that that"

"That there's gotta be some other set of pre-established rules that govern how mind works, right?I mean, if it's 
not cause and reaction, what is it?Yeah, I considered that.""Exactly!What did you do instead?What controls mind then?""Nothing.Just fucking chaos, dude."God looked at me behind disbelief."That makes *no* sense!""Well, it worked."He shook his head again.He ashed his cigarette on a passing cloud."Okay.Okay.What about the metaphysical 
problem of existence out of nothingness?Where did everything come from, why is there something instead of nothing, all that.What about that, huh?How did you fix that?""What are you talking about?*You* fixed that by existing.You're God.You created the universe.There.Solved.""But that just pushes the question to what created *me*" God said."You don't think I thought about that?I'm a walking contradiction.I explain the universe, but what explains me!?At some point, something must have come from nowhere.""Ah.True.Very smart."God smiled."See?You didn't fix everything.There's still existential despair in the universe because people don't 
know where God came from, and God explains the universe but nothing explains God, so nothing explains the universe.""Well, I just told them.""Told them?""Where everything comes from.Including God.""HOW!?HOW DID YOU EVEN KNOW THAT!?I DON'T KNOW THAT!""I lied."He paused."You lied.""I said you came from your mother.""AND WHERE DID MY MOTHER COME FROM!?""Oh, God, it's just turtles all the way down, get over it.They ate it up, that's what matters."He looked down beneath the clouds at the perfect Earth and the people living in harmony and the unpolluted 
environment and the warless, unified nation that was the planet now."I can't believe this.So you just gave people free will, told them that there's no satisfactory explanation as to where everything came to being and they just accepted it?""Well, I was a bit more eloquent than that," I said."But yeah.That's pretty much the gist of it.""What about death?What happens after you die?Surely that still anguishes people.The source of all human 
despair is deeply rooted in a fear of death.You didn't fix death.""First of all, let's not get arrogant, God.You don't die, so don't pretend to know what being mortal feels like."He stared at me rather foolishly, but didn't speak."But you're right, it's awful."I smiled."So you know, I just stopped it.""You stopped it.""No more death.I mean, frankly, what were you thinking, dude?Putting people in the universe, giving them 
self-awareness and then death-awareness?That's like telling your wife you're mathematically guaranteed to break up with her in a few years the day after the wedding and expecting her to be faithful.Of course it's not gonna work.""So nobody dies anymore.""Nobody dies anymore.""And everyone has real, true free will.""Free as non-deterministic birds.""And they all know that the universe is a logical impossibility that birthed itself out of nowhere like a will o' the wisp 
in a desolate marsh extending unto lands unknown?""Very poetic.You just wanted to use that line, didn't you, author?"Yes, I did.Go back to talking to God."Very poetic, God.And yes, they know the whole truth and they are fine with it and they don't die and they have true freedom.""And that fixed everything?""Well.Almost.I had to get rid of Bon Jovi's last album, cause it *really* sucked compared to his early 90s stuff."God thought about this.Then he shook his head."No.I don't accept it."He got up."Immortality doesn't fix existential despair.They're going to get tired of living eventually.Eventually every human being will experience everything there is to experience, meet and befriend and love every other human being, visit every corner of the universe, discover every piece of unknown land, do everything there is to do and then what?"I didn't answer."Then they'll turn their heads to the unanswered questions once more!Where did I come from?What is the meaning of it all?If free will is true, what are the rules that govern it?And if there are no rules that govern it, how can something purely chaotic even exist and make sense to our non-chaotic brains?And, and, and if there ARE rules that govern free will those rules must be absolute or not be rules at all, and if they ARE absolute then, then, then there is no free will by definition!"God flicked his cigarette, very intense now."Those questions need addressing!They need addressing so much that humanity built a whole society around shielding itself from facing these fundamental paradoxes and inconsistencies!They need addressing so much that the only reason humanity has developed culture and all the social fabric that now is put in place is because humans cannot satisfactory address these fucking issues and they'd go insane without distractions and false idols!All you did was push the whole thing with your belly!Sweep it under the rug!People live forever and think they are free in some higher form than they previously thought with my definition of free will, which, okay, was kind of shitty but still, and also you told them that the universe was created by God and that God was created by his mother and his mother by another mother and so on forever but that's not answering at all, it's pushing it under the rug again!What will you do when they figure that out!?What!?WHAT WILL YOU DO, ALPACA!?""They won't figure it out.I'm keeping them busy.""HOW!?FOR THE LOVE OF ME, HOW!?"I smiled."I built a new continent and put a water park there.Free admission, no lines, open bar."God stared down at me, panting, desperate, angry.Then he paused.Then he said, "Fuck, that's smart."

"This doesn't make any sense," Annie's voice sounded behind Jim, as he ran his eyes through the code onscreen."What?The universe was written in C plus plus?"Jim turned to her."You know C plus plus when you see it?""Intelligence is not exclusive to the funny-looking," she said."I can be smart *and* attractive.""Can you *code* in C plus plus?"Annie paused."Well no, but "

"Then maybe let the funny-looking people work," Jim said, turning to face Elon."What the hell does this mean, dude?"Elon was hunched over himself, sitting on a chair by their side, desolate eyes."This is the code," he said."The simulation code."Jim said, "Why the hell is the universe written in C plus plus?"Elon shook his head."It's not.It's in binary.We just 'de-compiled' it to C plus plus.""Why?"Jim asked."So we could edit it."Jim looked from Elon to the screen to the keyboard in front of him to Elon again."So you mean that this thing is actually *connected* to the universe?"he asked."It's not just a copy?"Elon nodded."Any changes in the code will alter the universe itself."He got up and looked at the massive screen in front of them."This isn't just a *representation* of the universe.It's the actual universe."Jim looked up at the lines of code in front of him, amazed.By his side, Annie whispered, "Holy shit"

"So you can control the universe," Jim said.For some reason, that made perfect sense inside his head, that Elon Musk could control the universe.Either him or Tom Cruise.There was just something about their faces."Yeah," Elon said, simply."I can.""Where does the code come from?"Annie asked."Who's controlling it?""No idea," Elon said."Whoever it is, they didn't contact us."Elon paused.Then he turned to Jim and Annie."Listen huh you guys claim you weren't affected by the lag, right?""Yeah.""Did you experience anything unusual?Before it happened?"Annie and Jim exchanged looks."I'm huh dating Karen Willow," Jim said."Not that that's *weird* or anything "

"It's weird," Annie interrupted.Elon nodded knowingly."Yeah, you're bugged."For a second, no one said anything.Then Jim cleared his throat: "What's that now?""Before we used the cluster bomb, we ran some tests on the code, and we didn't know what we were dealing with, exactly, so we ended up screwing things up a bit.Nothing major, as far as we know.""What kind of things?""Well...I'm afraid if you go through the code, you'll likely find that your relationship with Karen Willow is probably the result of a missing semi-colon."Jim and Annie went through the code and, sure enough, there it was."Brad Pitt too," Annie said, with a hint of sadness in her voice."Yeah," Elon said."A couple of people were affected, not just you.Started behaving differently, etcetera."He looked at the computer screen for a second, then pointed to a line of code."See there?Karen was supposed to be dating another guy named Jim, not you.Same for Brad and you, Annie."They ran their eyes through the code.Annie said, "I don't know what the hell those words mean," but Jim understood it.It was there, plain and clear.His relationship was a glitch."So it's all fake?"Jim asked, slowly."Well," Elon said, "everything is fake, technically, because we live in a simulation.But yeah, your relationship is *faker* than the rest."After a moment's silence, Jim said, "Why are you telling us this?"Elon took a deep breath."We've tracked down everyone who experienced the glitch and we've been asking them if they want to have it reversed.And you two are the last ones.If you hadn't come to us tonight, we'd probably have found you eventually, anyway.""So we get to decide?"Annie asked."If you debug the universe or not?""Well, no.We've debugged most of it, already.The lag thing is gone, and so are most anomalies," he said."You get to decide if you want *your* life debugged."He paused."And, of course, we'll also ask Mrs. Willow and Mr. Pitt that."Jim nodded, thinking back on Karen.The way she seemed devoted to him, she'd agree with pretty much anything as long as it meant staying together with Jim."We've made a decision already," Elon said."We're shutting down the project.It's best not to meddle with this, whatever it is."He paused."We were just waiting for everyone affected by the bug to make their decisions... so, if you want, we can debug your lives right now, or not."Jim kept staring at the screen, like the answer might be hidden there somewhere.By his side, he could feel Annie's presence, also silent, also looking at the screen."I'll give you two a moment," Elon said, stepping back towards the door and exiting the 
room.After what felt like a thousand years' worth of silence, Annie said, "Did you know my hair's not really green?""Really?"Jim said, with eyes onscreen still."It's blonde," she said."I was at an infinity pool with Brad and a bunch of celebrity friends when the lag happened.I didn't have time to shower.""I was having dinner at a three-hundred-dollar a dish restaurant," Jim said."With the third sexiest person alive."Annie nodded.Jim sighed, eyes going up and down at the code."What was your life like, before?"he asked."Shitty," Annie said, after a moment.Jim thought back on the lonely nights at home, checking Facebook every five minutes and getting that mini-high of a new notification every now and then, only to find out it was invariably something like 'It's so-and-so's birthday!'or 'so-and-so invited you to like this-or-that-page' -- so-and-so- and this-or-that invariably being people and things he had no interest in, and that had no interest in him.He tried to remember the last time he had a good day.Not a 'not-bad' day or a 'I-watched-a-good-movie' day, but a *good* day.A day he could remember the details.A day that didn't feel like the constant flow of it's-all-the-same that his life had become.He tried to think of the last time he had seen something cool and had someone to talk to about it.He tried to think of the last time he was as happy as when Karen Willow ran him over with her Bentley and asked him out.He couldn't think of anything."Do you think we're part the simulation?"Jim asked Annie, slowly."Like, our own selves are *coded* like the rest, like The Sims?Or do you think it's more like we're living *inside* a coded universe, but we're still real, Matrix-like?"Annie shook her head, eyes still onscreen."Does it matter?"Jim finally turned to face her."I don't know.Feels like it does, though."They stood like that, staring into each other's eyes for a long time, no words, just the soft humming of dozens of processors all around them in the Matrix Room.&nbsp;

Outside, Annie lit a cigarette just as Karen called."Yeah," Jim answered, fully aware of what was coming."Hi Jim?"her voice came, formal and cold."So, huh I'm actually gonna be kind of busy this week, so I don't think we're gonna have time to see each other.""Okay" Jim said."And I think next week too"

"Okay"

"In fact, why don't we call it a night, darling?It was fun, but I'm super busy and our lifestyles just don't match.""Okay"

The line went dead.By Jim's side, Annie puffed out a big cloud of smoke against the muggy Los Angeles air."Well, no more infinity pools," she said, sadness in her voice.She gave Jim a pat on the shoulder."I'll see you, nerdy kid.""Hey" Jim called.Annie turned back."What?""Do you wanna get a drink?Or something?"Annie looked him up and down, then smiled a crooked smile."Huh no, Jim.But thanks.""I figured," Jim said, nodding."Just thought I'd ask.""Well take care."He watched her get into the stolen Uber and start it and drive away, the cigarette out the window blowing an incandescent trail behind the car.A few minutes passed, and Jim didn't move.Elon stepped out from the front door behind him, pulling the collar of his jacket up."You all right, kid?""Yeah," Jim said to Elon Musk."I mean, as fine as a computer simulation can be.""Right," Elon said, with a chuckle."Well, take "

"Hey, you wanna have a drink, Elon?"Jim asked, hopeful.Elon looked him up and down, then bit his lips, uncomfortable."Huh... sorry, kid, I --"

"It's okay," Jim said, smiling."I'm sorry," Elon repeated, uncomfortable."I mean I have the wife back home and "

Jim nodded."It's fine, really."Elon patted him on the back."Be safe," he said, and stepped away towards the private parking of Space X.A few seconds later, his car rushed past Jim on the highway, disappearing into the night.Jim looked up at the fake stars hanging from the fake sky above his fake head.It was a clear night, and a bunch of the stars were out, and Jim thought that it was sad that it was all fake, but at the same time, as a programmer, he couldn't help but admire the quality of the work.I mean, the sheer amount of details that had been put into each and every star individually... all carefully crafted with their own peculiarities and quirks nothing procedurally generated, all hand-made.And not just the stars, but the planets, the nebulas, the black holes, the shooting stars, the animals, plants, rocks, molecules, atoms, everything... so beautiful and unique.And the people -- everyone of us with different personalities and noses and dreams and ears and thoughts.I mean, *talk about immersion!*

It was truly a masterpiece, the universe.Jim smiled, hands on his pockets, deep breath to the night sky.*I bet God's a bit of a loner too,* he thought, before stepping out from under the awning and starting his way back home.Netflix awaited.

Cro woke up to flashes of the previous night.He looked around, startled.*The spasmodic dance of a circle of light in the dark.*

He was surrounded by trees.Bird chirping reached his ear.Sunlight hit his face.*Roy's inanimate body over his shoulder.*

He looked around.Nobody.*Rain and Spielberg by his side, running.Running.A roar.*

In a swift movement, Cro got up on his feet."Slow down there, buddy."Cro turned around to find Jackson walking towards him from between the trees, a wet 
cloth in his hands."Here," Jackson said, extending his hand."Put this on your forehead.""What happened?Where's Rain?"Jackson's eyes narrowed.He looked down.Cro's mind twirled back to the previous night again.*Rain was by his side, running.Then she wasn't.*

In the confusion, Cro thought she might have run past him.Linda followed Jackson, offering a half-smile."You're up."His mind was a haze.His head felt heavy.Cro blinked repeatedly, trying to focus.They 
were at a clearing in some sort of woods.Not unlike the place he lived with Rain, all 
those years before.The remains of a fire still hissed and smoked on the ground by his 
side.Silence all around.And no Rain."Where's Rain?"he repeated, louder."Where is she?""Rain, uh " Jackson paused."Cro, she stayed behind.""What?No, I "

"We didn't see it, Cro," Linda added, careful."We didn't notice it until we were too far 
away.And the T-Rex was still after us, we couldn't go back."More flashes.Cro remembered they had turned on the alley that lead to the 
supermarket, the same one he and Rain had used to escape the Sipinosaurus.From that 
point on, everything was a blur."You passed out," Jackson continued."You were carrying yourself and Roy's weight for a 
good while at high speed.I don't know how you made it until here.You got some strength, buddy.""Please calm down, Cro."Cro rubbed his eyes.He was vaguely aware of his body's fast movement.Of looking 
around.Walking in circles.Breathing fast."We gotta go after her."Jackson and Linda exchanged looks."The girl's dead, monkey-man."The voice came from behind him.Cro turned to find 
Roy, a piece of wood wrapped with rope around his leg in an improvised fracture splint.He limped closer."It's been eight hours.The girl's dino shit by now."Cro shook his head."No.No.She's not dead.""What *we* gotta do is get the hell out of here and as far away from this place as we can."Roy turned to the others."Is Simpson back from scouting the area yet?We gotta keep moving.""We have to go back," Cro said, looking from Roy to Jackson to Linda."We have to go 
back for her.""Yeah, sure," Roy scoffed."We'll go back to the city where two giant dinosaurs were 
fighting each other and trying to kill us at the same time not half a day ago.Great plan, 
caveboy."Cro looked at Jackson and Linda."I hate to admit it, Cro, but he's right," Linda said."The city is not safe.Especially now.""We can't leave her!"He tried to make way past them.Jackson held him back."You're not thinking straight, Cro.You had a rough night.You go there now and you're dead.""She's gone, Cro.There's no way she escaped."Cro pulled himself free.He turned to face the two.He wanted to tell them.He wanted to make them understand.Tell them that Rain was not dead.Of course not.He wanted to tell them that he couldn't have failed her like that.Not the only person he's 
ever felt at home with.The only human being in thousands of years he didn't feel different from, estranged.The one who, from their first days just outside the museum, back when the world's end was fresh, had stayed by his side day after day.The one who didn't think *he* was the monster.The one who held his hand when she just a scared kid with a Jack Skellington doll.To Rain, he wasn't the thing she needed protection from.He was the one who protected.The one who kept her safe.And he couldn't have failed her.He couldn't be the monster."If the monkey-man wants to go, I say let him," Roy said."One less mouth to feed.""Cro, if you go back to the city, you won't get her back.And you'll die too."Cro shook his head."If you guys wanna go, you can go.You don't need to wait for me.""Your damn right we're not waiting for you in the middle of the woods," Roy grunted."Are you crazy?"Cro ignored Roy."Thank you," he said, looking at Linda."For taking us in when we needed a place.""Don't go, Cro.You're going to die."Cro tried for a smile and failed."That'd be a new one in my life."He turned his back to them and faced the road ahead.The contours of Santa Clarita drew themselves against the clear blue sky in the distance past the trees.*Don't be dead, Rain.Please.Please don't leave me.*

"See you guys," he said, without looking back.He started walking."Dude's gonna kill himself over a one-handed crazy chick.Go figure."Cro stopped.He turned back.Roy had eyes on him, defiant.He felt his chest burn.Fight or flight."What?I didn't say anything that wasn't --"

He took three fast steps and knocked Roy off his feet with a punch."What the fuck!Fucking animal, you  AAAAAH!"Cro felt Roy's broken leg under his feet.He pressed slightly, only enough that he heard 
the bone shifting out of position where it had broken.*Cleck.*

Roy's scream faded, and his eyes rolled white into his skull."Thanks for having me," Cro said, going straight past Linda and Jackson's wide-eyes towards the city.Fight or flight.He had never been that good with the flight part._____________

In his early years his mother dragged him through the alleys and the dark corners of the undercity, down below 
where lived the meek and poor women and the workers, hiding, always hiding from the women up above, who'd kill 
him if they knew.He grew up a contradiction, an opposite of himself  to the world he was a girl, his mother dressed him in skirts 
and makeup and bows, and in the dead of the night when she'd take his clothes and tuck him in bed she'd tell him 
stories of these larger creatures, this race that walked the Earth some many years ago, and she'd say, "You are 
one of them, you are men."What was men?He didn't know what that meant, he had no frame of reference save the chimeric images of these shadow-people that walked the past Earth alongside women, these dreamwalkers that his mother conjured at night with her stories.Creatures with hair on their faces, muscular, big, as big as mountains, sometimes he thought.What was men?What did men do?Save from the obvious differences he could spot when he looked at himself 
in a mirror, what else?Why was it dangerous?Why was it bad?How was he different?He grew up on those questions, never finding an answer.In his teenage years, his mother underfed him, on 
purpose.She gave him hormones so he'd stop growing.So his voice wouldn't change, but he didn't see, he didn't 
understand  how could his voice change?Why would his voice  change?"It'll grow deeper.""Why?""That's just how it is with men."Men.He was men.One of them.One of the shadowy figures, the mean, dark ones that walked the Earth, that had to be exterminated.But why?What did men do?Why was men evil?His voice changed, and he grew, despite the hormones and the humble meals.Past sixteen he could no longer 
leave the house save under a veil, save in the dead of the night, and only so when it was chiefly necessary.And new feelings were brewing in him now.Feelings for the women he saw, feelings about the world around him, feelings of tenderness and of other things but above all, with every night that passed hidden in that small 
apartment in the undercity, what grew in him more was a hatred.A hatred for the women who ruled that world, 
who cast away the 'men', who deemed them bad and evil, who condemned him without ever meeting him, ever 
knowing who he was or what he thought, judged and trialed and convicted him over a prejudice of the past, over shadowy figures that walked the Earth before he was born.If men were evil, he wasn't men.He was something else.But he *was* men, his mother said so.So men couldn't 
all be evil.So women were evil, because women judged him, determined he was bad without ever meeting him.Cast him to a life of growing up without identity, without knowing what or who or why he was not meant to exist.A mistake, a rough tumor in a delicate world.It was years, long years after his mother was gone before he figured it out.And then years, long years of planning, 
of studying maps, building sketches, until he finally managed to put into action his plan.He knew by then that the 
women were already engineered to have only other women, that his mother had been an aberration, something not 
likely to happen again.He knew that they got pregnant from a machine, and that all the DNA on Earth was stored in a single room.And he found the way in and through the tunnels he crawled and in the dead of the night he stepped into the room where it was kept, where all of it lay behind glass, all the specimen, and he knew the codes, he spent years and labored to learn them, and he unlocked every door and he destroyed everything.There was going to be no more genetic material save what was inside of him.And when he was found in that room, when the women found out what he had done, they spit and cursed in anger but ultimately they bowed to him right then and there, their throats dry and quivering from swallowing their disgust at him, but they bowed all the same, because he was the last hope for humanity now, he was all there was left if people were not to die and never be born again.He was the future.But he didn't want hope, and he didn't want future.He was men.He was born of hatred and darkness, he was the 
shadowy figure in his mother's stories, the great villain, the last on a line of wrongdoers, of darkness-lurkers, born 
and raised and existing solely for the purpose of evil.At least he was convinced of it.So he ran the knife cross his throat and let the blood wash down his neck, and the 
women watched in horror as humanity died right then and there, in front of them, the blood of all future human life
that would not be pooling in an expanding circle towards their bended knees.The blood of men.

"Hey.Hey.Hey!Wake up, jackass.I'm hungry."*That's how it starts* is what I thought.Schizophrenia.Not with a bang but with Charlie 
talking to me.Charlie is a cat, I should explain.My cat."Milk?Some tuna?That fucking canned shit you buy at the store that I hate?Anything?""Charlie" I started, careful."Are you  talking?""Seriously, you've got five minutes or I eat the dog food again.Or the dog.Whichever one is closest.""How are you  why are you  I'm insane.I'm crazy."Charlie rolled his eyes, which I didn't know cats could do."You're not crazy, I'm talking, I 
talk, you made a wish, whatever, I don't know how these things work but I'm here, I'm 
hungry, feed me."I went with it.I got his bowl ready and set it on the floor for him.He ate in silence.Then 
he burped."This tastes like shit, by the way.I know you're the one who buys, so next time go for the top shelf stuff, cheap fuck."&nbsp;

Some weeks passed before I got used to it.Schizophrenia or magic, the reality is my cat 
talked and I could understand him.And that test I had to take?The one I wished upon 
the star to learn all the languages in the world  which apparently included animal 
languages and really I should have read that in the fine print before agreeing?I aced it.I really can understand all languages.Including animals."Annie coming over later?"I heard Charlie from behind.I was leaned over some math 
books, trying to study for my exams."I don't know.Maybe.""You know she's out of your league, right?""Charlie, I'm trying to study here.""First time she came over I thought you were a bet.Seriously, I was pretty sure her 
friends were hiding in the closet.Like they had dared her to kiss the ugliest guy in school 
for like five bucks or whatever.Like an eighties teen comedy film.""Charlie, come on"

"Then I thought, they would never have picked *you* as the ugliest guy.Cause like, 
you're *too* ugly for this type of prank.Like, you're not funny ugly, you're ugly like it 
might be a disease, so it's not nice to joke around.""Charlie"

"Then I saw you two making out and I was like 'damn, you dog!'"Tucker  our dog  raced in, out of breath, tongue sticking out."What!?Anyone called!?""Shut up, idiot, go back to your squeaky toy," Charlie hissed."Squeaky toy!"Tucker yelled, then darted out."You should really have him castrated," Charlie continued, to me."It's mean to future dogs to let that DNA spread.""Charlie, I'm trying to "

"Then again all dogs are stupid, so I don't think it's really a Tucker problem, it's more an 
inherent vice of the species as a whole.Is there any of that sushi left over from yesterday, by the way?Im --"

"Charlie!"&nbsp;

The night I left for college Charlie didn't speak to me all day.Tucker didn't leave my side, 
cried like a little baby when I told him, then made me promise when I got back we'd spend at least a whole day playing catch and/or watching Bolt.Charlie stayed on his corner upstairs the whole time.It was only when I was coming down 
with my bags, after hugging Mom and Dad and saying goodbye to Tucker and was already 
half out the door to meet Annie that I heard his tiny footsteps down the stairs.I turned and found him halfway down."Bye Charlie," I said."I'll be back for summer.Take care, okay?"He looked back for a while in silence."At least your Mom's in charge of the cat food now, and she doesn't skimp on it.Enjoy California, jackass."He turned and headed back up the stairs without turning back.&nbsp;

Annie and I got married back home in the same church my parents got married, and the 
ceremony was presided by the son of the guy that married Annie's parents.It was small, 
short and lovely.We both agreed to spend the night before our honeymoon in our respective homes.I had 
dinner with Mom and Dad, played around with Tucker ("Dude, dude, duuuude!You're back, 
dude!You have no idea how many squirrels I've seen since you left!Dude, like, they were 
so many, man!Oh boy, this is the best day of my life!")and, when I was finally getting ready for bed, in the hallway bathroom brushing my teeth, he stepped in."Hey, jackass."I turned.He looked a bit older, the whiskers perhaps a bit weighted down and a touch of 
gray around his ears.He had also gained a little weight."Hey!What's up, Charlie?""So you got that poor girl to marry you, huh?""Sure did.""She's a good girl.Smart.""Thanks, Charlie.""She'll figure out she can do better sooner or later."I smiled."How's life been around here since I left?'"Same shit.Your Mom gets me tuna sometimes, I mean the real shit not the canned stuff you used to get me, so that's nice.The neighbors got a new cat, rude little fucker.The dog's still stupid.""Hey, I heard that!"Tucker's voice came from downstairs."Uh, a ball!"We both stood as we heard Tucker's footsteps distancing, chasing after some unseen ball 
in the backyard."Well, it's good to see you, Charlie.""Yeah, yeah, yeah.Good night, dickhead."He turned around and made his way down the stairs, and I noticed he didn't get around to it with the agility he once did.&nbsp;

I called off work as soon as I got the call.I hopped on a plane and six hours later was 
dusting off the snow from my jacket's shoulder, stepping into the house in hurried steps.Mom and Dad were upstairs, but Charlie was by the door when I came in."Charlie, what"

"It's the stupid dog," Charlie said, without looking at me, a constrained expression on his face."He's gone and got himself sick, the idiot.Running in the cold all the time like a lunatic, what did the doofus expected."I rushed up the stairs, two steps at a time.They were in my parent's room, mom and dad 
huddled around Tucker, who was laying very still, eyes open but breathing hard."Hey buddy," I said, crouching in front of him."Dude" his voice was weak."Dude, you came that's like" he coughed." awesome.This is like... the best day of my life."We took him to the vet, who said what we already knew.The disease, plus his age... it wasn't looking good.I wanted to stay, but Mom and Dad said they would take care of him, and I had to get back to work, and there was Annie and the baby to worry about too.A week later, back in LA, I got the call from Dad.Tucker was gone."Hey, Dad I know this is gonna sound weird, but can I talk to Charlie?Just can you 
put the phone on speaker around him?"Charlie answered with a sigh."Yeah?What is it?""How are you doing, Charlie?""Jim?"my Dad's voice interrupted."It's amazing, he's meowing right back at you!""Yeah, I know that, Dad.Charlie?""I'm fine, Jim," Charlie's voice replied."I get the big bed now and there's no one to wake me up at seven AM yelling about how the sun is bright, the sky is blue and everything is oh so beautiful and how it's the best day ever all the freaking time.It's a relief that idiot's gone, is what it is.Anyway," he spoke faster now, trying to get the words across as quickly as he could."I gotta go, I gotta take a shit."I heard the sniff in his voice as he distanced himself from the phone.Later dad would tell me Charlie barely ate that whole week.&nbsp;

Sean was four now and I watched from the window of my old room as he played with Sam, the new dog, in the backyard.Annie was with them, her belly starting to show already.It was the first day of summer vacation, and the plan was to stay the whole three 
months back home.A return to familiar settings.A quiet ninety days of family and comfort and peace.I had arrived a couple of hours before and hadn't seen Charlie yet and a sort of knot had 
appeared in my stomach and was tightening with each passing moment, and I was now afraid to ask.But finally I went downstairs and took a deep breath:

"Hey, Dad.Where's Charlie?"Dad looked up from the TV."You didn't see him?He's in the guest room bathroom, he 
stays there almost all the time now.Little dude likes the room for some reason."I climbed back up and stopped by the guest room bathroom door and sure enough there he was, lying on the carpet, head resting on his paws.He was very old now, the weight he had gained all gone, his breath a barely visible up-
and-down movement of his thin, patchy torso.I stood for a good while watching in silence."It's rude to stare," his voice came weak and cracked."The hell do you want?"I smiled."How are you feeling, Charlie?""I'm a thousand years old, it hurts when I fart and I can't eat tuna without feeling like I 
swallowed a piece of the sun, how do you think I'm feeling?"He turned with effort to face 
me and I noticed one of his eyes was milky white."You look old as shit, by the way," he said."That pretty girl left you already?""No.She's about to give me a second kid, though.Four months pregnant now.""God damn that stupid lady for wasting her life on this puddle of disappointment that you are.""You want anything, Charlie?Food?Milk?Dad says you almost never leave this room.""It's warm, quiet and isolated here, what more could I want?"I nodded."Okay... well, if you need anything..."

"Actually," he started."Do you... maybe... would you like to watch Garfield with me, Jim?""Really?"He puffed his cheeks."Fuck no, you idiot.Just leave me alone.And close the door on your way out."He turned back to face the wall.I noticed, as his body rearranged itself, that he had 
Tucker's old squeaky toy nested under his paw.I sighed, and then noticed Dad by the bedroom door staring at me."We got the call from the vet yesterday," Dad said."Not much they can do.""What?"I asked."Cancer," Dad said."Well, he's pretty old, it's not uncommon.Doesn't hurt much now but 
it'll get worse.When it does we'll you know, we'll do the decent thing."Dad shook his head and turned back to head downstairs.I swallowed dry and turned back 
to face Charlie, who remained motionless."Was that your dad?What did he say?Was it about the vet?"he asked, not turning his back."They took me to the vet last week, was he talking about that?"I paused."Can't you  can't you understand him?""Yeah, I can, but I asked you anyway cause I'm an idiot.No, I can't understand him, you 
moron.I can only understand you, that's the rule of this whole thing.What did he say?Are they going to shove another thermometer up my ass?Cause I swear to God I'll scratch someone's eye out."I stood and stared for a long time.His tiny body a hill of fur inflating and deflating with his 
breath.The squeaky toy under his paw.The way he seemed to struggle to even keep his head upright when he talked, his back to me."Vet said you're fine," I finally said."Just some old age stuff, nothing to worry about.""Good," he said."Now can you get the fuck out?And leave the door ajar so I can get 
some air here, will you?"I nodded and stepped out and pulled the door with me.Then I pushed it open again and 
stuck my head in."Hey, Charlie?""Trying to take a nap here, dude..."

I took a deep breath."You're a good pet, Charlie."He didn't reply right away.Then he lifted his head and turned to face me.For a long time we stood like this, eye to eye, just contemplating one other."Yeah whatever."He turned back, rested his head over his paws, closed his eyes and in a second was asleep.I stepped out and headed back to my room.I stood again by the window facing the garden outside.Sean and the new dog and Annie played around on the grass.Suddenly the sprinklers fired on and they all ran inside the house, giggling and screaming and laughing."Dude, dude, duuude!"the new dog yelled after Sean, as they ran."This is the best day 
ever, dude!The best day ever!"I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.Like Charlie, I too was tired, very tired.I let my mind go to the past.To college and meeting Annie and high school and boyhood and simpler things.All was quiet and dark and the room smelled of home.I opened my eyes again.Downstairs, under the late afternoon sun, the sprinklers turned to no one, shooting water spirals into the air.

The door came open and I knew right away.I just knew it.In a way, I guess I guess I kind of knew it all along."It's you" I said, to myself.The figure stepped closer.The whole room white, an endless white in all direction, and two chairs facing each other.He took his seat and I took mine."Yes.It's me."I shook my head and forced myself to face him.My own face."Look fuck, where do I start?"When they told me right after I died, that I was going to meet the person I've hurt the most, I braced myself for 
this conversation.I knew it.I knew it would be me.Because who else could it be?Who else have I mistreated more than my own self-loathing self?"I'm sorry," I said."Yeah, no shit," the figure said, folding his arms.This wasn't going to be easy.But I swallowed the sadness and nervousness and went for it."Okay, first, the drinking fuck, I don't remember when it started.It got out of control so fast I was hallucinating in no time,  when I went without it.Noises, shadows everywhere My own reflection twisted and deformed in the mirror, night after night"

The figure glanced at me, still keeping the arms folded."Delirium tremens, they call it.From the alcohol addiction."I paused."I know that wasn't all.I'm trying to think of the rest."I took a deep breath."The drugs, too.My own self-sabotage of my career and relationships... Everything.Fuck, I guess it's all related, right?"The figure unfolded its arms, but said nothing."I don't know why I did it all," I said."I guess I never really took proper care of myself because, in a way I never really learned to love myself.My parents, they they were distant.They lost a son, you see.And  huh  I guess 
they blamed me, for some weird reason.So I grew up without learning what love is.I grew up with this this sort 
of indifference towards death, like I'd rather burst fast like a shooting star than drag my life along for eighty years"

The figure now had its eyes narrowed, listening intently."I guess that's where the drinking and the drugs stemmed from.The careless driving, the whoring around it was 
all a way for me to punish myself to try and prove to myself that life was bullshit and meaningless because if I 
let myself believe that life could be great, it would mean I'd have to face the fact that *my* life wasn't great.That 
*I* was never loved.That *I* was never good enough."The figure said nothing.I cleaned the tears from my cheeks."It would mean that there was something to lose, 
after all.You know?As long as I kept beating myself -- my body, my soul  into oblivion, I was reinforcing my 
belief that I didn't *care*.Like a little kid who loses a bet and says 'I didn't want to win, anyway'."Silence.The figure kept its eyes on me, frozen."I guess I figured if I gave up right away, I would never lose."I stopped."But I see it now.I've hurt myself.I've hurt myself more than anyone else on Earth by doing that.I'm sorry, me.""Un-fucking-believable."I paused."Excuse me?"The figure scoffed, then shook his head."It's all about you again.Goddamn it, why did I let myself be talked into 
coming here?""What are you talking about?""I'm not you, you narcissistic halfwit!"The figure bellowed."I'm the twin brother you absorbed in our mother's 
womb!""Ooooh"

"Yeah, oooh, son of a bitch.You freaking *ate me as an unborn fetus* and denied me a chance to live, and *you're complaining!?*"

"I mean shit, sorry.I didn't know.""And you have the arrogance to think that *you're* the person you have to apologize to?Like, *oh my God, I'm 
so sorry to myself, how I've hurt myself and made myself miserable.Poor me.* Jesus Christ, the nerve on you."He paused."You don't have 'delirium tremens' by the way.It was me, haunting you from the beyond.Trying to get even for what you did to me.But you managed to make *that* about yourself too, somehow.""Hey, come on, you haunted me?That was uncalled for.""YOU ABSORBED ME AS A FETUS!MY LAST THOUGHT IN LIFE WAS 'GEE THAT OTHER BABY'S GETTING AWFULLY CLOSE'.""Okay, I guess you have the right to be upset."He shook his head and got up."Screw this shit."I got up too and said, "Hey, wait!"He stopped.Turned back."I'm sorry, dude.You're right.I messed up."He looked me up and down, and I saw a little bit of the anger melting away from his face.I sighed."It's just...I can be a little bit *self-absorbed* sometimes.""Oh, for fuck's sake."He turned his back on me and stormed out, disappearing in the whiteness of the room.I looked around.Scratched my head.Puffed my cheeks."Jesus Christ, what a drama queen.""OH GO TO HELL!"came his voice from somewhere above.And well... turns out I did.

Nova heard the clanking of the lock being pulled open behind her.She didn't look back, but rather kept facing the altar.It was around lunch time, but she never ate as soon as the food arrived.She'd always wait at least an hour.It was her little rebellious routine  her way of maintaining some control.*Yeah, I have to eat the food so I won't die.But I don't have to eat it when you tell me to.*

"Nova?"Nova turned.By the now closed door, watching her behind blank eyes was *not* a clay bowl filled with protein soup, but rather a large man in a Special Forces suit (who, to be fair, also look like he was filled with protein, but was definitely not soup)."Who are you?"Nova asked, stepping down the golden steps."I'm the fucking army," the man said.Nova didn't react."Your rescue mission," the man explained."My name's Michael.I was sent after we received your last video log broadcast.To rescue you.""Oh" Nova looked around the room they were in, pausing her eyes on the locked front door behind him."Well, good job."The man stepped closer."Who are those guys?Are they aliens?""Aliens?"Nova shook her head."No, they're people.Didn't you look at them?""I was going to, but then I realized I can't see when people put bags over my head."Nova gave the man a lopsided smile."Cute.I didn't think Special Agents had any sense of humor.""We usually don't, but they teach you to tell jokes in stressful situations to avoid panicking the victims."Nova shook her head in a chuckle and turned back."So you didn't get a look at our hosts.Well, they're human, all right.""What are humans doing here?Weren't we all supposed to have left like, *a long* time ago?"Nova turned back and sat on the last step of the altar."Well, evidently, not all of us did."The man looked around at the candles and the inscriptions on the wall and the high ceiling above, frowning as if he had only now suddenly realized where he was."What kind of cell is this anyway?It looks like a --"

"  church?Yeah, that's what I thought when they first put me here," Nova said."You're not that far off, actually.""What do you mean?"Nova got up."Come here.Let me show you something."They walked past the altar down the wide platform leading to the far end wall.Nova lead the man to the corner where the wall bent left.She crouched, and he crouched after her."It starts here," she said, pointing at the first of a series of drawings on the wall."What?""Their history.I can't really read the language, expect for a few words that still read like English.But the images paint a picture all by themselves.""What picture?"the man asked, narrowing his eyes as he ran them through the first set of drawings.Nova risked a glance his way."The picture of a whole civilization built on abandonment issues."&nbsp;

Michael skipped his eyes from drawing to drawing.They were painted on the flat surface of the wall, like cave paintings, but better executed.Each a frame of a story, connecting to the next one on top, then the next one, then the next, then the one on the left, then down, down, down, down, then left and up again, spiraling a story that, little by little, started to make sense in Michael's head."The first drawings are from the days of the Departure, when humans left the Earth," he heard Nova saying, over his shoulder."You see here?That's Los Angeles."Michael brought his eyes back to one of the first drawings.He hadn't noticed it, but she was right: one of the first cityscapes painted on the wall was a Los Angeles sunset."And this," Nova said, pointing to another drawing just on top, "is Cape Canaveral.The 
day of the Departure."Michael kept going, head bobbing up and down to follow the story in the images."See here?This one is called 'The Last Ship Out'."Nova pointed at a drawing near the center of the wall.It depicted a ship midair, spitting fire against the ground, pointed upwards to a sky full of stars."And you see here, way in the distance?"Michael squinted.In the corner of the painting, way in the background, human-like shadows with bright eyes under hoods watched the ship leave, their faces pointed up.They looked hopeless and small, no more than children under the blackness of the night."We left them," Michael whispered, beginning to understand the story the drawings were telling."We left them here.""Yes," Nova said, indifferent."Apparently, our ancestors rendered Earth uninhabitable and then packed up their stuff and set sail to a better place, leaving behind everyone who couldn't afford to go with them."Michael went on, walking parallel to the wall, his eyes going up and down.After The Last Ship Out, the next images grew progressively darker.More than a few depicted seas of  dead bodies, famished looking children, mass graves, wars

"One percent of humanity fled.Ninety nine stayed," Nova said."And ninety nine percent of those ninety nine died before or in the process of building the underground city  which became the only place still habitable on Earth."The next drawings showed just that.The digging and the building of a maze of underground tunnels and chambers.The construction of the very place Nova and Michael were in right at that moment."They built their whole world from the scraps and the wreckage of the one we left behind.Considering the tools they had at their disposal and the fact that they couldn't survive for long up on the surface  I think they did a pretty good job."Michael reached the far end of the wall, and, with it, the last couple of drawings.They showed an underground city now very similar to the one he had seen earlier  grand, busy and even somewhat majestic.Way above the city, past the dirt and the surface of the Earth, a sky full of stars shimmered still.In between the stars, rocket ships with the US flag hovered menacingly side by side over the planet like heavenly entities."It's been more than two thousand years," Nova said."English slowly evolved and changed, turning into a new language.Traditions were lost and discovered and created.Music.Arts.They've developed a whole new culture from scrap.A whole new civilization."The rockets seemed to have an indescribable creepy quality to them, like they were purposely drawn to look menacing.Something about the way they stood still in the sky, gigantic above the underground city, made Michael feel very strange."Soon enough, their origin story -- the historical facts that lead to their way of living -- became legend.And then myth."Nova paused.She took a step forward and stopped by Michael's side, shoulder to shoulder, eyes on the last drawing."Finally, it became a religion.The religion of the great men from the times before, and the way they cursed the Earth and flew away to the stars, leaving the meek to rot in the wastelands.""We're Gods to them" Michael hushed, almost to himself.Nova turned to face him, then looked back at the hovering ships against the stars."Gods?No, Michael.Their religion has no Gods.Why do you think they locked us here?Why do you think they're so afraid to kill us?Why do you think they bring me food everyday, and keep me trapped, but dare not hurt me?"Michael turned a questioning look Nova's way.She turned too, and stopped her eyes on him, dead serious."They don't revere us, or admire us.They're afraid."She took a step forward, and Michael could see the graveness in her eyes as she spoke."We're not Gods, Michael.We're Demons."__________________

Check your frontpage!/r/psycho_alpaca is trending!So yay!Apparently I'm supposed to expect an increase in traffic today, so I decided to compile some of what I consider the best stories of the sub in one post, so that people who are just now subscribing can catch up with my writing (and tell me to fuck off if they think it sucks, because it doesn't get better than this).So here we go, in no particular order:

_________________

 -- A supervillain and a superhero are roommates, but they don't know.Every day, they go out and do battle, and then they come back and take care of each other while lying about how they got all beaten up.-- A cure is made for a zombies virus outbreak.Everyone who has been infected is cured, but they retain their hellish memories from their time as a zombie.You are a doctor (or psychologist) treating of of the cured for PTSD.-- You are a shapeshifter that has forgotten your true form.One day you see someone else using it.-- You are about to sign your contract with Satan in blood, when all of a sudden, God bursts through the door to try and make you a better offer.Satan and God begin to barter for your very soul.-- While sitting in a public area, a supreme being abruptly appears and while pointing directly at you yells "Seriously!This guy!This guy right here!Fuck this guy!"and quickly returns to the heavens.-- An average person is given the "superpower" that their word will always be accepted as an absolute truth -- but the person doesn't know what's going on.--  Years ago a curse was cast that all people wearing costumes would turn into real versions of the costumes.This is now an annual, known and accepted phenomenon.-- It is the year 2099 and true artificial intelligence is trivial to create.However when these minds are created they are utterly suicidal.Nobody knows why until a certain scientist uncovers the horrible truth.These next two are multi-part stories, if you're feeling like committing to something a little longer:

 -- You're midway into your flight when you, feeling bored, decided to surf the Internet.You read breaking news about another plane disappearance.You're on that flight.-- You swerve to avoid a squirrel.Unknown to you, the squirrel pledges a life debt to you.In your darkest hour, the squirrel arrives._________________

Happy reading!And, hey, if there's a particular story you like that I didn't list here, feel free to post it in the comments!

Brian assumed it was porn, because the folder was named DONOTCLICK and was hidden inside seventeen other 
folders that all read DONOTCLICK like a Matryoshka doll of digital shame.But alas, what was hidden in his brother Dave's computer was not porn, but a collection of videos of himself 
staring at the camera.Brian studied the thumbnails and then clicked one at random.*"Hi,"* his brother's face said, against a white background.*"My name is Dave and, if you're watching this, they've 
killed me."*

Brian frowned.He raised the volume.*"The lizard people are real.The president is one of them.I have unveiled their secret, and for that they are after 
me.Like I said, if you're watching this, they caught me, and they're going to come for you next, so you have to 
listen carefully.You need to "*

"What is going on?"Brian turned back and found Dave staring at him from the door.His brother's eyes went from him to the computer 
screen, and then he froze."Where did you find this?""Where I thought I was going to find porn," Brian said."What the fuck is this, Dave?"Dave rushed to the computer."This is private!""No, no."Brian, who was much stronger than his younger brother, quickly stepped in front and defended the 
computer."You're explaining this.""I have nothing to explain."Brian turned back and quickly clicked another video."What is this?A series of videos on lizard people?Are you one 
of *those* guys?""No, Brian, I "

The next video played.Same as the first, Dave facing the screen: "*Hi.My name is Dave and, if you're watching 
me, the aliens have landed and I'm dead."*

"What the fuck"

"Brian, please, I "

Brian clicked a third one, fighting his brother off with his free arm.*"Hi.My name is Dave and, if you're watching this, then it means that the zombies have taken me already."Brian paused."All right, you're gonna have to explain this, Dave."Dave sighed and gave up trying to reach the computer."Okay, okay.So, I recently got really into conspiracy theories"

" and?""And I figured...I know they're not *all* true, but at least one has got to be, right?"" okay.""So I decided to make goodbye videos for all of them, just in case."Brian laughed and shook his head."Seriously!?""Don't laugh!""Oh, God, Dave!"Brian clicked another video:

*"Hi.My name is Dave.If you're watching this, then it means that Bigfoot really does have internet access and 
found out about my research on him.I beg you to tell my family that --*

*"My name is Dave, and if you're watching this, Stanley Kubrick did indeed fake the moon landing.And not only 
that, he faked his own death too apparently, because I'm dead.*"

*"My name is Dave and, if you're watching this, I fell off the edge of the flat Earth.Who knew!?"*

"*Hi.My name is Dave and I have discovered the reason they sell hot dogs and buns in different quantities.If 
you're watching this, the ketchup industry has had me killed already."*

"*Hi, I'm Dave and I have uncovered a conspiracy involving the television show Jackass, Smirnoff Vodka and the orthopedic cast industry."*

Brian couldn't stop laughing."Jesus Christ, Dave this is insane!""Yeah, well one of these is bound to be right.And then when we get killed I'll have a video explaining everything 
and you won't.""I'm sorry, Dave, but there's no way in hell any of these are *ever* going to happen.I mean, listen to this!"He clicked a random video.Dave's face popped up again onscreen:

*"Hi.My name is Dave and if you're watching this, then I am already dead.I have recently discovered that my brother and I are actually characters in a prompt response on Reddit with no real free will or drive.The author, a low-life degenerate by the name psycho_alpaca, is a known literary fraud who can never finish his stories properly without killing everyone in the scene, so I fear that my time is short.I need anyone who is watching this to --"*

Brian paused the video and stared at Dave, all laughter forgotten.Dave took a step back, panting.His eyes went wide."Oh my God" Brian said, slowly."You don't think "

But then they died, and the last video on Dave's computer mysteriously vanished before anyone found it.

"Get out of my way!"John exclaimed, blasting through the double doors of the hospital and knocking a nurse  
tray of surgical instruments flying into the air included  to the ground."I have a kid to save!"Behind him, John could hear the fast steps of his follower  he presumed it was Glen, but there was no time to 
stop and talk.He had to get to a cancer kid.*Any* cancer kid.It had all happened so fast.One minute he was laid lazily on the couch, his left ball hanging from his ripped boxers, playing The Division while Glen did some assignment for school or whatever it was that he did all day, when the old man materialized himself in front of the TV like a goddamned wizard."I'm a goddamned wizard!"the man had said, confirming John's initial suspicion."I come from the land of Azarthov with the mission of granting superpowers to humans."Glen turned away from his computer and, like John, stared at the old man in a state of quiet desperation, his eyes so wide they were almost coming out of their sockets."Did this man just materialized in our living room, John?""Oh, shit," John, who was hoping he had accidentally bought crack from his weed dealer and was now hallucinating, 
said, realizing that Glen (who was a vegan and never once even smoked a cigarette) apparently could also see the wizard from Azarthov."He's real!?""I am going to grant you superpowers so you can protect the realm of Earth.One of you will be the Punch Healer.You will be granted the power to heal people with punches," the wizard said.And then John thought back on his life.On how he was twenty five and working at a high school cafeteria and how he had no girlfriend and no car, and how Glen had a girlfriend *and* a car *and* a degree and prospects in life, and how unfair it was that just because you don't study and you like to smoke weed all day you're destined to a shittier life than someone who works and studies."I'll do it!"John screamed, and the wizard cast a golden ray of light from the tip of his fingers towards him.John 
felt his whole body shake and warm up like he had been submerged in warm water."I must warn you," the wizard said, as he turned to Glen, "that "

But John wasn't listening anymore.He sped out from the apartment and ran down the stairs, heading straight for 
the nearest hospital.This was it.He was going to save a kid with cancer's life and start his superhero career.This was his one opportunity to make his life matter, to do something worthwhile, and he wasn't going to stick around for the terms and conditions of his powers, or worse, for the wizard to realize that Glen was *way* more qualified than he was to be a hero.&nbsp;

"John wait!"Glen screamed from behind John, as he kept making way up the stairs of the hospital."No, Glen!You won't take this from me!"John screamed back."The wizard chose me, not you!For once, I am going to make a difference!I will be the Punch Batman!""It's not what you think, John, just wait!"John burst through the Radiology door and was propelled into a wide, white corridor.A few abandoned stretchers 
and wheelchairs decorated the place, but there didn't seem to be anyone in the 

And then he saw him.Small kid, sixteen, seventeen tops.Head all shaved, walking slowly past a number of closed doors towards the end of the corridor."Imma save your ass, cancer-kid," John whispered to himself, sprinting for the kid.He tackled the boy to the 
ground with his whole body, then quickly pinned his wrists to the ground with his knees and started punching.Once.Twice.Three.Four five six seven eight punches!*Is it weird that this kid is bleeding?I guess it must take a while for the healing powers to take place.* Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen!*Holy shit he looks really hurt I wonder if I punched the cancer out of him already.Is he breathing?Should I punch harder?That's really a lot of blood, I can barely see his face anymore.*

"John, for fuck's sake!"Glen burst through the stairway door and screeched to a halt in front of John, leaning against his knee and catching his breath.He stopped his eyes on the scene in front of him."Oh, shit!You just punched a cancer patient to death, John!""What?No I didn't," John said, though the motionless bloody body under him seemed to contradict this statement."I was healing him!""The wizard didn't give *you* the healing punch power!He gave it to me after you left!"John got up."What!?Really?""Yes, really," a low voice came from behind a room door.A second later, the wizard emerged from it and reached John and Glen in slow, peaceful steps."You don't have healing punches, John.Glen does."The reality of what he had done fell over John suddenly and heavily like a rock tied to another, heavier rock."I killed a cancer patient" he whispered.He had failed, again.More spectacularly then any time before.He had committed *murder* against an innocent person in his feeble attempt to make his mark on the world."I killed a cancer patient," he repeated."Well, not exactly," the wizard said."Turn him around."John kneeled and pulled the body by the shoulders, revealing a big red swastika stamped to the kid's shirt."You killed a nazi, not a cancer patient," the wizard said."This guy was on his way to room 314 to kill a Jewish kid with cancer.So you actually saved a cancer kid, but not in the way you thought you had."John frowned and turned to Glen, who looked even more confused than he did.Then he turned back to the 
wizard."Wait.What superpower did you give me, back in the living room?"The wizard smiled a kind, old man smile."You're Captain Failure.You save people's lives by failing to do what 
you're supposed to in a way that accidentally causes the situation to solve itself."For a while, no one said anything, and the hospital corridor was quiet like a hospital corridor.Finally, Glen puffed 
his cheek and shook his head."Oh, for fuck's sake, that's *so* much cooler than healing punches."John smiled and lit a doobie.

I'll catch Susan smiling at me for no reason.This has happened more than once.We'll be 
watching TV, just the two of us, like always.Then I'll notice with the corner of my eye 
that she's got her eyes at me, not at the TV.Head turned ninety degrees my way, a 
frozen smile on her face I can only barely make out in my peripheral vision.Something 
unnatural about it.And then I turn to look and she's got her eyes on the TV again.I asked her about it the 
first time, she denied it.I was afraid I'd sound crazy if I pushed it, so I never asked again.There were other things, too.Susan had a twin sister.Died during the birth.She never talks about it.Just last week, I turned off my lights and closed my eyes, Susan was already asleep.I 
woke up in the middle of the night to find her side of the bed empty.I turned around and 
she had that same smile, by the side of the bed, watching me."Honey, what are you doing?"Nothing."Honey?"Just the smile.She made way around the bed and nested herself under the blanket like 
it was nothing."How long were you standing there?"I asked.She didn't answer.But her side of the bed 
was cold and the carpet was sunken in the shape of her feet where she was standing.&nbsp;

It didn't start out this crazy -- for a long time, I tried to convince myself it was all in my 
head.But it wasn't.She was not Susan.I started doing these little tests -- that's how I made sure.I'd put movies we've already 
watched on TV, just to see if she'd say anything.Started telling her stories that I told her 
already.She'd smile.Never called me up on it.I asked her, point blank, one day.I got home and she was eating fish.Susan never eats fish.Susan hates fish."Salmon?"I asked."Tilapia. "I sat on the table across from her.She smiled."I was talking to principal Dawson about Sarah, today."I said."Sarah?""Yes.Our daughter.Sarah."She chuckled."Right.What did he say?""Susan, our daughter's name is Camille."She stopped the fork halfway to her mouth and rose her eyes at me.Slowly set it back 
on the plate."Who are you?"I asked."I'm going to bed," she said, getting up.I slept in the guest room that night.With the door locked.&nbsp;

I ran away the next day.Took Camille with me.We spent the night at a Best Western 
close to Needles."Where's mommy?"Camille asked, just before bed."I don't know honey.But if you hear anything -- any sound at all -- you wake me up, 
ok?""Ok."

I dreamt of a woman just like Susan that night.A woman that wanted the life of her 
sister, the life she didn't get.&nbsp;

Camille woke me up in the morning.She was eating a cupcake."Did you take that out of the minibar?""No, Mommy gave it to me. "I paused."Mommy was here?"Camille nodded."Yeah, she was standing right there by the bed.She was there for a 
really long time.""Why didn't you wake me up, Camile?""I was going to, but then Mommy went like this."Camille put her finger over her lips and 
went 'shhh'.I looked down.The carpet was sunken where Camille said Susan had been."It's ok, daddy.She was smiling."&nbsp;

The following night we were almost out of the state, at a bed and breakfast by the 
border.I turned off the lights, tucked Camille in and waited, sitting in the armchair, in 
silence.I knew she would come.It was dead quiet, and I was dozing off when I heard the hinges creaking.I opened my 
eyes and waited.The door came open in slow motion.She came in, no sound but the 
door.Walked to the side of Camille's bed.That smile on her face.I got up.I went behind her.She couldn't see me, her eyes were locked on Camille."Come on, honey.We're going home," she whispered.She didn't look back.She never even saw the knife when I plunged it in.&nbsp;

The lawyer later would tell me I was awarded no bail, and I'd have to wait for trial at the 
mental institution."Capgras syndrome," he said."It's a delusional misidentification syndrome, not unlike 
Fregoli.A disorder in which the person holds the delusion that a friend, spouse, parent or 
family member has been replaced by an identical-looking impostor."I told him I was protecting my daughter.I told him that woman wasn't Susan.Still, the newspapers all read 'Successful L.A.Engineer kidnaps daughter, murders wife.'"It wasn't Susan!"I said to him, again and again."It wasn't Susan!"He said I was looking at twenty-five to life, but the insanity plea might still come 
through.&nbsp;

They locked me in last night, my first night at the mental institution.Camille is with 
social services, they say.My room is covered in cushion material, from wall to ceiling -- 
a padded cell, they call it.So I won't hurt myself.Took me a couple of pills to fall asleep.Something woke me up just minutes before dawn.By the time I opened my eyes, it was 
dead quiet.I went to the door and peaked out through the little window.The corridor was deserted.I looked back.Just by my bed, the cushions covering the floor were sunken in the shape of two feet.

*"Protego!"*

The dummy's spell ricocheted off of Timmy's wand and blasted out into the warehouse ceiling.Nevertheless, the general was shaking his head when he approached Timmy."What?"Timmy asked."I deflected the spell!""We don't use *Protego* here, I told you," The general said.He turned to the dummy, who had been animated to life by Timmy himself, on the general's orders, in order to help with the training."Are you watching?"The general asked.He raised his wand."*Exitium Ruina!*"

A bolt of blue light blew out of the tip of his wand.It collided against the dummy's chest.There was a monstrous blast and, a second later, Timmy was thrown from his feet.His back knocked against the warehouse wall, and he was momentarily blind and deaf.When he managed to get up and open his eyes  his ear still ringing *Beeeeeeeeeep* like an alarm  he saw a huge crater in front of the general where the dummy was a second before.The dummy itself was nowhere to be found."What the hell was that!?"Timmy asked, eyes wide."*That* was a real defensive spell," The general told Timmy."Banned in a hundred and fifty two countries.The International Magical Committee considers its use a war crime.""That's not a defensive spell!"Timmy yelled."That's a portable atomic bomb!""Timmy, Timmy," The general said, stepping heavily towards him."The best defense is offense.And the best offensive is ridiculously violent offense."Timmy rubbed his sore neck, tired."I don't think I'm ready to learn this particular spell yet.""That's okay.One thing at a time," the general replied."How about we practice something else?""Okay," Timmy said, glad that the general had at least a bit of understanding in him."Like what?""How familiar are you with the cruciatus curse?"Timmy frowned at the general."I'm not going to torture innocent spiders, if that's what you're proposing, sir.""Oh, no!"The general took Timmy by the shoulder and walked with him."No, I would never ask you to torture an innocent animal, Timmy.""Good," Timmy said.They approached the far end wall of the warehouse.The general stopped in front of a rusty metal door and turned a smile at Timmy."You're training the cruciatus curse on a real Death Eater we caught just last week!"He flung the door open, and Timmy's eyes stopped on a poorly-lit humid room with nothing in it but a bucket of water, a light bulb dangling from a wire on the ceiling and a metal chair.Tied up to the chair, hair wet and face bruised and swollen, a man had his head down to his chest, unconscious and bleeding."What the hell!?"Timmy asked, turning terrified eyes at the general."Too soon?"The general closed the door, leaving whoever the unconscious man was alone in his room again."All right, we'll get to torture when it comes to it.Now"

"No!"Timmy said, folding his arms."No, no 'now'!I'm tired of this training.When do I get to go to real school?All I do is destroy things and learn awful spells in this warehouse all day.""Go to *real* school?"The general laughed."This *is* real school, Timmy!You're just in private training, that's all!""What?"The general fast stepped to the edge of the warehouse, where a large double door rested closed.Timmy followed.The general pulled the doors open, and the two of them stepped out into the sun.Timmy's eyes ran left to right.He was in an open grass field decorated all around with pull-up bars, weights, climbing walls, obstacle courses and other warehouses.A battalion of young men in military robes passed by them, marching in a single movement behind a man in sergeant uniform.The man sang: "I love working for Uncle Sam!"And the crew followed: "*I love working for Uncle Sam*"."Lets me know just who I am.*

"*Lets me know just who I am.*"

"I will learn to cast my spells!""*I will learn to cast my spells*!""And send Death Eaters straight to hell!""*And send Death Eaters straight to hell!"*

The general rested a heavy hand on Timmy's shoulder and said, his voice wrapped around a proud tone: "Welcome to the Texas Military School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

"Board calls Mr. Axl Rose to the stand."*Eww.Shit.*

The cat makes his way proudly down the aisle and takes the witness seat.Behind me, watching, Thor breathes heavily, his tongue out.He did the best he could, with his testimony that I couldn't have been a better owner for a dog, that I was a great companion growing up, that we played all the time, etc, etc etc.But now this guy.Axl has mean eyes all around the room, and I get a feeling his statement won't be so kind."Will you kindly share you experience living with Mr. Alpaca during his college years, Mr.Rose?""Yeah.Yeah, I'll share my experience.He's a grade A asshole, that one."The cat's pupils contract as he flashes me 
an eye."You're making a big mistake if you let him into heaven.Dude belongs in the seventh circle of hell.""Can you be more specific?""Yeah, I'll be more specific.He named me Axl Rose, for once!Do you have any idea how times the neighbor's cats 
did funny dances and sang Patience and November Rain when I walked by?""I dont "

"All the time!"He flashes me another look."I was bullied to oblivion!""Is that all he "

"He also beat me.""Objection, your honor!"My lawyer stands up."There is no evidence that my client ever beat Axl Rose.""Actually, I did throw him against the wall once," I say, unsure."What!?""He grabbed on to my leg and bit me, it was a reflex!I apologized!And I felt horrible!""The hell you did!"Axl yells."Did too, you were just too busy meowning for me to go fuck myself!""Order!Order!"The judge asks him to carry on, and Axl does, and he does a fine good job of smearing my reputation.He tells 
them that I didn't feed him at the right times, that I left him alone for days, that I was verbally abusive, that I 
didn't take him to the vet often enough

He does such a good job that by the time he is done, the judge sighs and says, "I'm afraid that, faced with this
testimony, I'm forced to deny you access into heaven, Mr.Alpaca."He bangs his hammer over protests from the crowd, and over whimpering from Thor.The room stands up and the room fills with noise, and my lawyer drops his head."God damn it.I'm sorry, Alpaca.""It's all right," I say.On his way out of the room, escorted by the guards, Axl throws another look my way.It is only much later, after I fill all the paperwork and go through immigration into Hell, way late in the night, when 
I'm assigned an apartment by the Great Lake of Fire, Tortured Souls, Murderers, Psychopaths, Serial Killers and 
People Who Shaved, a little old place in a motel-style building, that I confirm what I suspected.I open the door and step in, and Axl's sitting on the couch, waiting for me.He smiles.I smile."I thought you'd have ended up here, you bastard," I say."You never did a single good deed in your life.""'sup.Grab a beer and come sit," Axl says, drinking milk from a can.He burps, then stretches on the couch."We gotta figure out a way to bring that goody-good Thor here now, too."I grab a beer, I kick off my shoes and I go sit with my best friend.

There is only so much a man can take."Listen to me very carefully," I say to the man with the bloody nose and the teeth 
missing tied to the chair in front of me.I sit down in front of him and I put my palms together in front of my mouth like I'm about to pray."I want my pizza.""You're crazy," the man babbles, blood dripping from his chin."Do you have any idea what Hans will do to you when he finds out that "

I rise to my feet and he shuts up.Where we are is in a basement.The basement of an abandoned house I used to drive by every day on my way to work, when I had a job.How we got here is I put this man in a trunk and I drove him here.Why we are here is this man showed up at my front porch with a kilo of cocaine demanding a hundred thousand dollars in payment when all I asked for was a pizza.All I asked for was a pizza.A no crust cheese pizza with pepperoni, just like my mom used to make.Before Monica started fucking my boss and got *me* fired for it, somehow.Before she made me move out of my own house into a hostel and kept the kids  not that I ever cared much for the two assholes anyway.Before my bank called me about my staggering credit card debts.Before my friends stopped calling because no one wants to hang out with a forty-two year old divorced idiot with no money sharing a room with twenty-something backpackers because he can't make rent because his wife took all his money along with his dignity and his will to live.That's all I wanted.I had ten bucks and forty-five cents in my wallet, and I wanted a cheese pizza *with* pepperoni and *no* crust before I climbed up the stool and put the rope around my neck and called it quits on this freemium shitshow of a game we call life."He's gonna kill you," the man continues."Just let me go and I'll take the stuff back, and I won't say a word.But if you kill me, Hans is going to "

"I don't know who Hans is," I say, simply.The man shakes his head."He owns LA, God damn it.Every pound of cocaine that comes into California goes by him.And he's my cousin.If you kill me, Hans is "

"Let me make something very clear to you," I say, grabbing the knife from the backpack and turning back to face the man."Because apparently you didn't quite understand what I said.I said *'I don't know who Hans is.'* That is a statement of a truth.It is a fact."I step closer to him."Not a question.Not *'Who is Hans?'* Not *'I would like to know more about this Hans person'*.No.All I said was 'I don't know who Hans is."I crouch to his eye level.His gaze stops on the knife.I smile."I have no interest in knowing more about Hans.I'm perfectly fine not knowing who Hans is.I don't want Hans biography, interesting as it might be."I pause."All I want from Hans is my pizza.Because I called his establishment and I asked for a pizza, and I didn't get a pizza.And that doesn't seem fair to me."The man breathes heavily, then spits blood on the floor."He's gonna kill you.You're a dead man.You're gonna die because of a pizza."For a while, I just keep my eyes on him, saying nothing.Then I get up."Yes, I'm gonna die.That has always been the plan."I stop."Well, not always, but at least since Monday, when I decided to.However," I say, as I make way around him and rest the knife on his neck, "I am *not* going to die until I eat my pizza.Because you know what?This life is full of misery.It's full of cheating wives and cheating husbands and kids who don't like you and bosses who are rude to you and beautiful, beautiful resorts and paradise islands you can never afford to go to.This life is filled with the joy of others and dreams that never come true.It's filled with bullies and ex-lovers and sad songs and a whole lot of misery, more than anyone can take."I pause, then I start plunging the knife into his neck, slow but steady."And a man deserves a pizza in this life.A man deserves to get what he wants, once at the very least, before he calls it quits and dies already, middle-finger up in the air to whatever God there *isn't* as he's dragged down to the depths of the hell he deserves to burn in."The man's screams turn to gurgling, then scratchy sounds like an old record.Then he stops thrashing and goes silent and I finish the job.I take his head out.I wrap it in a nice Spongebob Squarepants gift box and I seal it with a pink bow.Then I write *c/o Hans Pizza and More* on the outside.Then I write, under it: **I want my pizza.**

Then I get in the car and head for Hans Pizza and More to drop off the box.Because there is only so much a man can take.Because everyone has a limit, and every fuse has a bomb attached to it, and it might take weeks, months years... but if you don't put out that fuse, at some point, everything is going to blow.And it won't be pretty when it happens.Because there is only so much a man can take.And I want my pizza.

A week or so had gone by, according to Michael's estimate.It was hard to tell for sure, what with there being no windows in the room and the fact that he was in a different planet from the one he had been born in.Nova and he had developed a sort of routine: waking up, waiting for their first meal, waiting an hour before the guard left to eat (a 'tradition' Michael saw no point in, but indulged in nevertheless mainly as a way of showing good guest manners), talking about escape plans, talking about life in general, eating again, going to sleep.Repeat.Repeat.Repeat.Michael was beginning to accept that there would be no escaping this new life  not even death, since the Earthlings dared not touch them  when the door came open one day, in between meal times.In came not one of the regular guards, but rather a face Michael knew from one of the wall drawings behind the altar.It was the face of the Earthling's spiritual leader  a short, stocky man with hair and beard going down shoulder length.He walked in followed by two larger men and stopped in front of Nova and Michael, hands behind his back."What does he want?"Michael asked Nova, after the man had stared at them for a solid ten seconds without saying anything."I dont know dude, he never came in here before."The man raised his right hand and motioned for the two of them to get up.They did, and the guards grabbed them by the shoulder and dragged them towards the door.One of them produced a thick old rope and, pulling Michael and Nova's wrist together, tied the two of them to one another."What is this, so we don't run in different directions?"Michael asked."There's only one ship out of the planet.If we manage to escape, we're going the same way."Nova was about to reply when the short man reached them and again motioned  this time for them to exit the room.Michael and Nova exchanged worried looks, then crossed to the dirt tunnel.&nbsp;

The walk was silent.The short man walked ahead of them, with the two security guards close behind.Unlike when Michael had first arrived, the way was now lit by torches hanging from the dirt wall, giving the tunnel a uniform golden glow that flickered and waved against the walls and the floor as they relocated the air with their passage.Michael thought to himself, not without a bitter sense of irony, that the whole thing reminded him of depictions of Hell in Old Earth religions.The long dark underground corridor, the fire... not to mention the two demons being escorted towards wherever they were being escorted to.Twice they stepped 'outside' into the wide circular chamber, going across suspended bridges.Twice Michael noticed the looks on people's faces at them, the bridge swinging dangerously under his feet as they crossed  a look of fearful admiration, like they were witnessing something grand.Like Michael and Nova being escorted by the short man was their equivalent of watching the Pope share a glass of wine with Jesus.Or Judas.They went back into the tunnels.After about ten more minutes, the short man stopped just by a metal hatch not unlike the one Michael had come in from, except this one was encrusted on the wall, rather than high up on the tunnel ceiling.He turned back to his security guards and said something in their language, and the men nodded and turned back in mechanical soldier fashion.They stepped away, leaving Michael and Nova alone with the old man.The man stared at them for a second, hands still behind his back.He had a permanent calmness to his looks, like nothing in the world could prompt him into making a rash decision or losing his temper.Michael glanced at Nova."You know, if this hatch leads outside, I think we can knock this old fart out and make a run for it," he said.Nova didn't answer, but a kind smile drew itself against the short man's lips."The hatch does lead outside," the man said, in perfect English."But there's no need to knock me out.I'll walk with you."_____________________

Rain woke up to a tiny reptile face.The creature pecked her forehead  its bite no more 
than a poke.Again.Then again.Rain shooed the tiny Compsognathus away with a hand wave.She turned around, lying 
on her back, and her eyes faced the car axle.Like a system rebooting, the previous night begun to flood her mind.&nbsp;

The supermarket.The chase.The building collapsing.The others running past her.The Spinosaurus.Rain remembered being faced to face with the beast  Spielberg still in her arms, the 
others running further and further away.She remembered standing there, just her and the beast like a Wild West showdown.The first bite found only air as she threw herself to the ground.A second later, the dinosaur had almost crushed her to death with a step that sent pieces of sidewalk flying.Rain had crawled under the car just in time to avoid the second bite.Her head pressed down against the pavement, her arms still wrapped around Spielberg, 
she closed her eyes and prayed dinosaurs didn't have object permanence.That part of 
your brain that lets you know that something is still real if it disappears from your line of sight.She felt the animal's breath as it lowered its head to the ground  wet and cold.Her eyes closed, she listened to the low-breathing, feeling the monster's presence not three feet away.The car bobbled and moved over her.Then again.Then a third time.Then silence.Rain open her eyes only when the animal's footsteps were already out of earshot."It's gone," she had said, turning to Spielberg.The velociraptor had its eyes half-closed, 
an ugly patch of dried mucus around the eyelids."We made it, Spilberg."*Screech,* came the low, weak cry.Rain felt the animal's body for the wound.Crossing from the neck all the way to the tail, 
a large piece of flesh was missing where the T-Rex had closed its jaw.Spielberg 
recoiled at Rain's touch."It'll be ok, buddy," she said, and she felt her eyes water."It'll be ok.It'll be ok, 
Spielberg."And she kept saying it, even as Spielberg's half-opened eyes started half-closing.She kept saying as she pushed back the tears.Kept saying it as she felt the raptor's 
breath slowly coming to a halt under her hand, one shallow up-and-down of its body at a time.Rain kept lying that it would be all right long after Spielberg's eyes had closed and his body stiffened.Feeling the taste of tears pushed back rising up to her mouth, she pulled the raptor's body close to her, tight like a teddy bear, all the while whispering."It'll be all right.It'll be all right.We're going to be all right."&nbsp;

The pack of Compsognathus dispersed in all directions as Rain pulled herself from 
under the car.It had rained during the night, and the frost of early morning laid a blanket of fog over the puddles between the cracks on the sidewalk.On a grassy spot between two buildings, Rain dug Spielberg's grave.With rocks and 
metal bars and her hand, she spent the better part of an hour digging.When she was done, she returned to the car and took the raptor's body in her arms.She felt a warm pressure rise in her nostrils, but swallowed the tears back down.She was done crying."See you, buddy," she said, placing Spielberg's body on the grave."Wish I could give 
you a better send off."Rain covered the hole best she could with dirt.When it was done, she stabbed a single 
piece of wood to the ground, marking the raptor's final resting place.She stood beside the grave for a full minute, in silence.She didn't pray.She didn't cry.Finally, Rain opened her eyes.With a deep breath, she turned and made way back to the street.Sunlight falling down all around her, she looked from one side to the other.She had no idea which way the others had gone.She had no idea if Cro was alive, or if he was looking for her.But she knew *she* was alive.And between the two buildings, by Spielberg's grave in her silence, Rain had made a decision.She was alive.And she was going to stay that way.With a deep breath, Rain pulled her shirt collar up and picked a side.She started 
walking._________________

The first one is supposed to be twenty words long, ten have gone already, Jesus this is gonna be hard.Okay, I have nineteen left to go, not too bad, shit, ten already, I better start saying something productive.On the other hand, writing is hard in and of itself without these constraints, what is OP thinking?Who on Earth can convey emotion, sadness, joy, tears, rage in such a ridiculous pre-determined word count?Oh shit, oh fuck, is pre-determined just a single word or is it two separate words?And does the 'Oh' from the previous sentence count as a word or just interjection?I still haven't said anything meaningful; this is why I don't do constrained prompts.I suck at them, it always ends with me babbling my way out.We're at twelve words and I don't even have a main character .Okay, his name's John Francis Wilson Jackson Taylor Jones Smith Lewis.Eleven words  how'd you like that, OP?FUCK, THAT LAST ONE WASN'T TEN WORDS, SHIT, SHIT, SHIT!The caps phrase was ten, ignore the phrase before!Okay, eight now, cool, let's go  John was Fuck, out of words, gotta try again.John was a bright young man.He liked to write stories.They were all shitty.But he tried.He did.Fuck.

*The problem with suicide*, Ethan thought, looking from the gun in his hand to the drawer on the other side of 
the room where he kept the bullets, *is that it requires too much initiative.*

He studied the gun, tired.Then, grunting like an old man, he pushed himself away from the mainframe computer and dragged his tired, unwashed, unattractive, unloved body to the other end of the room.He opened the drawer, but there were no bullets there.*I must have left them in the car.*

He looked out the window across the heavy rain beating the open patio in front of him.In the distance, he spotted 
his car at the very edge of the parking lot."Meh.I'll do it tomorrow."He went back to his seat.Everyone told him that the night shift at the SETI headquarters would depress the shit out of him.They warned him that people go insane, all alone in that big NASA lab, hearing the hypnotic beep of the computers, listening, listening, listening to nothing."The thing is," people would say, "there are no aliens.So you're just there from ten at night to eight in the morning all alone listening to the universe.Listening to nothing."But Ethan thought: *My wife left me, my daughter won't return my calls, my boss publicly harasses me daily and 
my dog hates me so much it actually learned how to roll its eyes.I can't possibly get more depressed.*

Well, he was proven wrong, all right.It wasn't bad at first.I mean, it was *bad*, like most of life is bad.Like, in that way that everything is bad because 
of the absurdity of the human condition bad.The way that bread never really tastes that good because you know 
about the heath death of the universe and all.'Displeasing' was the word.Like thinking about the fact that there were pets aboard the Titanic.But it wasn't *awful* until the second month.That's when Ethan really started contemplating the whole suicide 
thing."Being alone with your own mind," he said, to the empty room around him, "is only fun if you have an interesting 
mind."Ethan didn't have an interesting mind.He was boring, and he knew that.His wife would complain daily, before she 
left: "Why are you so *boring*, Ethan?"And he'd answer: "I don't know."Because it was true.He didn't know.As far as his adult life went back, he had 
always been the kind of guy who wasn't particularly into any specific kind of music, wore cotton turtleneck sweaters, drove a beige Corolla and didn't speak any foreign languages.He was the kind of guy that drank Vanilla Coke.*Mundane* was the word his wife used before she left."Mundane" Ethan repeated, his voice echoed across the large room over the humming of the air conditioning."Mundane.""Shut the fuck up already, they're going to hear you," came a voice from his computer.Ethan froze, his coffee mug halfway to his lips.The voice had come from one of the 'listening' computers.The ones designed to capture back any signals that 
might come in reply to the ones Earth sends out daily.Those computers had never, not once, made a sound."What?"Ethan asked, so low he wasn't even sure he had said anything.The screen came alive in a rainy hiss that gradually turned into a face that was human, but not so much.I mean, it could certainly pass for a human being's face, but there was something off about that face.Like it had been put together by someone who had all the pieces and an instruction manual, but had never really seen a human being before."Stop broadcasting stuff all over space," the face said, as the image came in and out of focus."You're gonna call their attention to yourselves.They're gonna hear you.""Who's they?"Ethan asked, because, for some reason, *that* was the question on his mind at that moment.The figure looked down."Wait are you alone there?""Yes.""Shit, they got you already" The face looked away, then back at the screen."Listen we'll get you aboard, dont 
worry.""Huh," Ethan said, now dealing with the fact that the reality of what was happening had begun to sink in and was making him feel all weird and tingly and shaky, like when he was eight years old and the magician at Leslie Brown's birthday party had called him onstage to help with the trick.The sound of typing reached his ear from the computer, then the face said: "All right, we're beaming you in.""Beaming me what?""Just stand still.Don't move."The face paused."And, hey I'm sorry about your people.""What what do you mean?""You said you are alone on the planet, right?They got to you.They killed your people.Right?"Ethan had a lot of questions.Who was *they*?Was the person in front of him really an alien?How did that 
seashell get into his shoe when he was fourteen, during a family trip to Arizona?But he saved them for later, because he realized the face on the other side of the screen had misunderstood him.The face thought he was alone on the planet."No, I meant"

And then Ethan paused.He bit his lips and considered his life, thinking back on every interesting and noteworthy 
moment he had ever lived.A highlight reel of his life.The whole thing took seven seconds and a half, not counting that thing with the sea lions and the pretzel, which really just happened *near* Ethan, but not *to* him."What?"the face asked."What is it?""Nothing," he said."Beam me up, dude."

"Say, Matt," I ask, as Melody grabs the axe by the door."Didn't you ever wonder why everyone tries to kill us on 
our birthday?""I do sometimes," Matt replies."And I think I know the reason.""Really?Why don't you tell me?"Melody swings, and I crouch just in time to not have my head cut off."Well you know how we are best friends?"Matt asks, as Will cocks the gun by our side on the couch."Yes.""And you know how our birthdays are on the same day, and that's why everyone is trying to kill us now?""Sure.""And you know how this is really bad exposition dialogue and no one really talks like this?""Uh-huh."Will fires.Matt and I cover our reads as we run to the door.My mom shows up with a ceramic knife, swinging 
around like crazy.Down the stairs, Matt continues as we run."Well, I noticed all these things a while ago, and I have to say I 
suspect we're in a shitty YA novel.""Really?"The sound of Will's gun firing reach us from the top of the stairs as we reach the front door."I think so.I mean, notice the incredibly unrealistic doomsday scenario."I open the door and look around at the usually-quiet street.All our neighbors are out carrying guns and knives and all sorts of dangerous-looking weapons, looking for us."Notice the set of seemingly arbitrary 'rules' that serve no purpose other than to create conflict and tension.""I see your point," I say, as we make way to the back of the house."Why would people kill each other on their 
birthdays?""Exactly.Also," Matt pulls me behind a bush just as Melody steps out from the back door of the house."Notice the 
cute girl with the odd yet charming name."Melody looks around.Her blue eyes sparkle like ocean storms in high seas."Yes!The cheeky, over-the-top descriptions!"I say, noticing it too now."This is definitely crappy YA material.We're one Jennifer Lawrence away from a hit movie, dude.""Exactly," Matt says."And well, you know what you have to do now.""I do?"Melody step-by-steps her way closer to us."You have to conquer the heart of the girl.And then start a revolution.""Against whom?""Who the hell cares?End the story in a cliffhanger, then, if it's a hit, make it up as you go on the second novel.""Will that work?""Worked for Maze Runner"

I step out from behind the bush, and Melody rests her beautiful, dolphin-gray sparkling eyes that are also blue on 
my somber-yet-charming figure."Melody!"I say."Psycho!""Listen we have to get together, Melody.We're in a YA novel."Melody takes my hand, the axe still resting on hers."Didn't you write a story like this before, Psycho?"'Shh, it's been a long time, no one will remember it," I say, running my hand through her golden-like-pale-morning 
hair."Everything's going to be ok, Melody.""It is?"Melody asks, still holding on to the axe."Yeah.Yeah, it's a YA story.We're gonna get in trouble, then out of trouble, then fall in love, then fight, then fall 
in love again, and in the end everything is going to be PG-Thirteengly fine.""You sure?""Positive."I close my eyes and wrap my lips around the strawberry-sweet rivers of happiness that are her lips.I 
hear a soft metallic screech as she raises the axe and, a second later, I feel the hit against my left leg.I fall to the ground a second after the leg.Blood everywhere."Did you just cut my leg off?"She swings again, and now my other leg is gone."Tis but a scratch!"I say.She swings again, now against my neck.My lifeless head rolls down the yard, stopping by Matt behind the bush.Matt gets up, looking from my head to Melody."Shit.Guess this wasn't a YA story after all.Poor Psycho.""Well, he wrote it," Melody says, shrugging.Matt shrugs too."That's true.Wanna get some ice cream?""Sure," Melody replies, and then she kills him too, because I just remembered I mentioned it was also his birthday 
at the start of the story, and consistency is key.

"It's interesting to note the choice of rats as an instrument of torture in 1984," Mrs. Garfield said in her soft voice."It is, of course, Orwell's way of comparing the human condition under a totalitarian regime to that of a lab rat.Always following instructions, always bumping against walls working for the benefit of powers he cannot understand."George Orwell exchanged looks with his friends.From the corner of the class, a twelve year old Shakespeare nodded lightly, encouraging him to speak.George Orwell raised his hand."Yes, Mr.Largewood?"They all had chosen fake names, of course.When, during the annual time travelers party, the group of authors 
decided to go to the future masked as little kids, they had collectively agreed on fake names, for safety.The only restriction was that the names had to be somehow related to the male genitalia."I'm sorry, Mrs. Garfield, but I don't think you're right.""Oh, you dont?""Nope.In fact, I suspect Mr. Orwell's choice of rats as a form of torture stems from his irrational fear of rats.""And how do you know George Orwell had a fear of rats, Mr.Largewood?"Another hand shot into the air."If I may intervene," Tolkien tried, in a low voice, "I think it was widely known by the 
literary society of the time that George Orwell was both terrified of rats and a fan of hentai pornography."Orwell turned an angry look at Tolkien."Hentai didn't even exist in the forties!"Tolkien smirked."Well, you'd know.""Silence!"Mrs. Garfield narrowed her eyes at Tolkien."Mr. Roundballs, please, where did you get that information?""I read it on the internet, Mrs.Garfield.""Well, you're wrong.Just like you were wrong about Shakespeare having two penises.And about Jack Kerouac 
having a secret cousin who invested in the oil industry, giving him the motivation to write about road trips."Jack Kerouac leaned forward and whispered in Charles Dickens' ear: "That one's actually true.""Silence, Mr.Shaft!"Mrs. Garfield turned from Jack Kerouac back to Tolkien."And you're also wrong, Mr. Roundballs, in thinking that Tolkien only wrote The Lord of the Rings because he had a fetish for hairy feet.""It's not a fetish so much as a healthy preference for "

"Enough!"Mrs. Garfield looked around the room."I don't know where you all are getting your information, but I can guarantee you are wrong.Now let's move on.Who was in charge of reading The Hitchhikers Guide to the 
Galaxy?"Douglas Adams raised his hand from the last row of the class."And what did you think, Mr.Sweatyboner?""I thought it was a bit pretentious.""Really?""Yes, I feel like I couldn't relate to the author at all."Mrs. Garfield smiled at the first normal observation in her class that day."That's a very interesting point, Mr. Sweatyboner.Did you know Douglas Adams also used the rat metaphor to discuss the human condition?""Of course I know, I wrote the bloody book.""Excuse me?""I said of course I know, I read the bloody book," Douglas said quickly, after being elbowed by Homer."Well, what did you think of it?"Mrs. Garfield turned her eyes at Homer."And stop elbowing your classmates, Mr.Goldencum.""I think Mr. Adams thought the image of rats ruling the world was pretty hilarious.""And"

"And nothing.That's it.That's the whole reason he used the rat thing.Just like the number 42."Mrs. Garfield shook her head."There's a whole deal of symbolism behind the choice of the number 42 as the 
meaning of life, Mr. Sweatyboner.In numerology, for example, 42 is "

"It's a random number!"Douglas interrupted."I just wanted to pick a random number that sounded random!That's the only reason why the joke is funny, because the number is random and has no meaning!If you give meaning to the number, there's no joke!"Shakespeare leaned closer."Relax, Douglas, we're here for the laughs.No stress."Mrs. Garfield was shaking her head in front of the class."You all need to study a lot more.You need to learn your 
Shakespeares and your Adamses and your Dickensens and your Kerouacs.I'm disappointed.""Hey, no Tolkiens?""And your Tolkiens.Thank you, Mr.Roundballs."Asimov got up, eyes on his wristwatch."Guys, it's time to go.The time warp will close soon."All the authors got up.Mrs. Garfield frowned."What is going on?""Nothing!"Jack Kerouac replied."Thank you for a wonderful class, Mrs.Garfield!"The group gathered at the center of the room and, with a low *whoosh*, vanished from sight.Mrs. Garfield blinked repeatedly, staring blankly at the rest of the students in the classroom.No one said a word.One second went by.Then another.Then five.Then ten.Finally, the focus returned to Mrs. Garfield's eyes.She scanned the room with a semi-smile, clapped her hands and 
said: "All right, classroom.What do you guys think psycho_alpaca wanted to convey with all the penis references in this story?"

"You're fat.""What!?"Will scratched his head, awkward."You're fat.""Will, for the love of God," Marie shook her head, went to the window, pointed outside."The world's a 
post-apocalyptic nightmare and you're worried about me being fat?""I just you were hot.Like, really hot.With the lenses on.""It was an illusion!"Marie marched back towards him."The lenses projected a perfect world to our brains so we 
wouldn't see how much we were being exploited by the government!They faked a perfect world while in the real 
one everything is a nightmare!""Okay, that sounds derivative.Isn't it from Twilight Zone?""Black Mirror, I think, but whatever, I didn't come up with the prompt.""We're going meta already?""No, sorry.You're right, it's too soon.Maybe later."Marie pulled a seat and held Will's face between her hands."We have to fight the government, Will.Fight it!""Okay, okay.It's just that I liked you better when you were hot.""Well, you're fat too, Will.You looked like Michael Fassbender in *my* lenses, but I'm not complaining, am I?""Fassbender, realty?"Will checked himself in the mirror.A short, stocky man stared back, and he let his shoulders 
drop, sad."Shit.""Focus, Will!Focus!We need to fix the world.""Yeah, yeah.Okay.""I mean, look outside!"Will looked.Out the window, the people walked by a nightmarish landscape of burnt trees, 
cracked pavement and smoke, a lightning-painted sky of heavy clouds and flashes beyond fiery mountains in the 
horizon."These people are all going around like everything is perfect, Will!They need to know!""How come they don't constantly bump into stuff?"Will asked."Like, the lenses change what they see, so they're 
walking around a completely different world.It's not like the lenses affect reality, so wouldn't they keep bumping 
into stuff?How come they dont?""Suspension of disbelief.""Ah.Clever.""Anyway, let's go outside and tell them the truth!"Marie got up."Now wait a second."Will put a hand on her shoulder."Why, exactly?""What do you mean why!?They're living a lie!""Yes, but they don't know it's a lie, do they?They think they live in a perfect world.""Are we having the Matrix discussion again?I can't keep having this discussion every time a dystopian prompt comes up, Will, we have to get past this at some "

"I mean, think about the machines in the Matrix.They were really the good guys.They ended the war and gave us 
a home  a perfect world.Fake, yes, but we didn't know it was fake, so who cares?They just ended the bloodbath 
and put us in a nice little warm planet and said 'all right, so everyone's happy now'.And freaking Morpheus was 
like 'nah, dude, we'd rather like in the nightmarish reality of burnt skies and infinite Hugo Weavings."Marie rolled her eyes."Now you're gonna talk about Vanilla Sky, aren't you?I know you are.God damn, Will, you "

"Like Tom Cruise's character in Vanilla Sky.Everyone he knew was dead.He was deformed.Jobless.Hopeless.And 
he could choose to just stay in the dream, you know?Just stay forever in the dream, dating Penelope Cruz!Who would jump!?Why!?Why jump!?""You do realize some people reading this have never seen Vanilla Sky and you may have spoiled the ending, right?""Or or or!"Will smiled."He *doesn't* jump, and the only reason I've included this little snippet is to make this 
spoiler joke and then subvert it so people would think I spoiled the film but I really didn't.People who *did* watch Vanilla Sky are now going 'hah!that's clever, cause I know Tom didn't really jump!'""Well, now you just told them he *doesn't* jump, so you spoiled it anyway.""Except he might have jumped.I may have lied the second time.""Well, does he?""Doesn't matter, now it's confusing enough that it's not a spoiler anymore, 'cause people won't know whether I 
lied when I said he jumped or when I said he didn't.I've successfully unspoiled the film.""Can we get back to the matter at hand, please?""Yes, I feel like we're drifting dangerously close to meta territory again.""What were we talking about, anyway!?""Phenomenology, the foundations of reality and if there's a valid philosophical distinction between what we consider 
to be 'real' triggers for phenomena  that is, for sensorial and mental experience  and 'fake' triggers, like VR, the 
Matrix and Penelope Cruz.""Shit.Really?I thought we were just rambling 'cause you couldn't come up with a decent answer for the prompt.""Nah, we're talking about real shit."Will frowned."And I'm not writing this story.""You're not?""No, I thought you were.""Nope."An Alpaca in a suit cruised by out the window in the distance."Shit, we're starting with the meta stuff again, right?""Yup.""All right, seriously, though.Meta stuff apart, there's a real issue to be discussed here  is reality just the sum of all our experiences?Or is it something more?""Is this even relevant for the prompt?""Course it is.Cause depending on the answer we go and help those folks or not.If we feel like reality is something 
that *actually* exists beyond our perception, then there's an objective difference between living in VR La La Land 
like those people out the window and experiencing the real world like we are.But if reality is only the sum of our 
perception, entirely created in the brain, then I say we call 'reality' the one with the best features.If it's all just 
tickling in our brain, why not live 'a lie'?Why not put the lens on again?""Shit.My eye's itching.""Oh, fuck.Don't tell me."Marie pinched her eye carefully."Oh, Marie, for fuck's sake, that is such a clich.""I know, I know!"Marie pulled out something  a little translucent device  from her eye."I can't help it, I'm not 
writing this!"She looked down at her finger."What is it?"Will asked, in a bored note, because he knew what it was, because this Inception-bullshit trope where 
the 'real' world is just another layer is old and tired and eye-roll worthy, but I'm sorry, it's the best I could do."What is it that you have in your hands, Marie?""It's another contact lens" she raised her eyes."We were just living in another level of illusion, Will!Oh, mother of all that's bad sci-fi!""What do you see?"Will asked."How's the world different?""Oh my God" Marie said.She got up, shaking.Trembling."What is it, Marie?What do you see?""I see a predictable twist, Will.Of course."Marie shook her head."I see a predictable twist."

"Where are we?""Greg?Is that you?""What's going on?Why are all these penguins looking at me funny?""Penguins?I don't see any penguins.All I see is a prism.""A prism?""Yes, like a gigantic cover art of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon hovering above.It's covering my whole field of vision.""June, sit up.You're looking at the sky."June rose her body.She was sitting on grass, and noticed she had indeed been lying down with her eyes up at the sky before.Skipping right past the fact that said sky was an overblown photograph of her third favorite progressive rock album, she looked down and tried to focus on the world around herself and Greg:

They were sitting in the middle of a green flowery garden.A soft breeze danced by them like convenience store air conditioning.All around, gigantic silver and gold buildings towered up towards the clouds, scrapping the multi-colored sky above.At ground level, past the perimeter of the garden in all directions, penguins ran around here and there down busy streets, briefcases in hands, looking mighty serious and stressed out.A few had stopped by the edge of the garden and were looking at Greg and June behind curious eyes."Are we in a penguin dimension?"June asked, getting up.The penguins leaned back in a startle when she moved, like Russian soldiers would when Stalin sneezed near them."I think maybe it's possible that we are," Greg replied.June looked sideways at him."You just used three different expressions to communicate the fact that you don't know something.That's gotta be a record.""You used nineteen words to point that out.That's also kind of stupid.""*Oh.Burn.*"

June shook her head, annoyed.Of all the people she could get lost in the Multiverse with, why Greg?Why on Earth did it have to be the idiot?Greg stepped forward, looking up and around at the landscape."I wonder why Jon Bon Jovi sent us to this dimension."He stopped and looked down, frowning at himself."There's a sentence I never thought I'd say"

Shaking off the negative thoughts over her traveling partner, June stepped past Greg and strolled toward the curious penguins at the edge.Some turned back and quickly returned to the street, marching out of sight.Others leaned away, but stood their ground."Excuse me.Excuse me," June said, focusing her eyes on one of them."Could you penguins tell me where we are?""Penguinsylvannia," one penguin said, careful.June was suddenly very annoyed at the thought that a whole reality existed solely for the purpose of a bad pun.She shook it off."Penguinsylvannia," June repeated."Ok. And do you know where we can find --"

"Hey, what's going on?"Greg asked, joining them."Are you from around here?"another penguin asked."You look different.""We're from another dimension," June said."We were sent here by Jon Bon Jovi.We are looking for the reason why people in our dimension are getting sick and we are not."The penguins exchanged looks.They talked amongst themselves in hushed whispers.Then one of them looked up at June."You should talk to our leader in the North.He is rumored to know all the secrets of the Multiverse.We are mere peasants.""Ok. Who is your leader up north?""Vladmir Penguin.""Oh, for God's sake, that's not even a good one."Greg smiled."Hey, that sounds like the name of that Russian guy back in "

"Yeah, I got it, Greg.It's a pun."June looked from the penguins to Greg."Didn't you notice?It seems this whole place is built around penguins and puns.""Punguins," one penguin said, hoping in his spot cheerfully.June rolled her eyes."Where do we find Vladmir Penguin, then?""Take the North road," the penguin replied, pointing back."If you follow that street, it will lead you right into the start of the path.It's a two day walk, but it's lovely this time of year.Except for the dragons and the murderous squirrels."June frowned.She couldn't tell if the penguin was joking or not.The street he was pointing at was clean, wide and shiny, like everything else around it.It went straight through the large skyscrapers towards the edge of the city, and it seemed to turn into a dirt path right before disappearing from sight between green hills.Somewhere in the distance, bells towed.The penguins checked their watches and looked up in a hurry."Well, we gotta go!Good luck with Vladmir!"one of them said.Then they all turned back and bounced their way to the streets, disappearing in the turn of a corner behind a golden building.June looked at Greg, who was following the penguins with curious eyes and a semi-smirk on his face."What!?"June asked."What could possibly be funny?""Punguins" Greg said, slowly, his smirk widening to a dreamy smile."I just got that."June's eyes almost did a full three sixty.__________________

I open my eyes to a blinding white light and a fat face.Is this heaven?Is God fat?"Welcome to the Ship of Fools."The fat face smiles at me, and I sit up, blinking myself to sight.The room around me is white clean, spacious and vaguely circular.A soft piano in minor scale rings above my head 
in the background.The place does look like heaven, if it wasn't for the Nespresso coffee machine on the corner.No way heaven serves Nespresso."What is your name?"the fat face asks me."Dean.Where am I?""I think I just told you," the fat face says, with a smile.A hand holds onto mine."Come on.Up you go."I rise.Looking more carefully, I notice the squared windows on both sides, framing dots of stars against the blackness on the outside."Is this a spaceship?"I ask, rubbing my head."The Ship of Fools is an idea originally set forth by Plato," the fat face tells me, putting a hand behind my back."It was an allegory about how society and the state didn't give philosophers the credit Plato thought they deserved.Come.Walk with me."We go through an automatic door into a long, wide corridor, its walls painted in strips of indirect lighting from the 
floor up."The story tells of a vessel without a pilot.A ship filled with the madman, the idiots and the deranged.A ship that would set out to sea without a captain, destined to roam forever aimlessly and with no course.""I'm sorry, I won't be able to focus if I don't get this out of the way  am I dead?"The fat face smiles.To our side, an automatic door slides open, and I catch a glimpse of a woman in short hair and 
heavy makeup, scribbling furiously on the walls with what looks like chalk."Come.Let her be," the fat man says, pulling me further down the corridor.He continues his story."Those who ventured to the seas were warned to avoid this ship of madmen.To steer away from the dangerous boat of outcasts, too deranged to be a part of society.""That's a lovely story," I say."But I'd really like to know if I'm dead."Another door slides open, this time to our right, and three men in hospital gowns sit around a chess board, each 
taking turns moving a single pawn across the board."You are not dead, Dean," the fat face tells me."And you are not the first  nor will you be the last  to try to take the despair over your ignorance to the stars."The hallway bends left, then we stop abruptly in front of a large double door."The question afflicts us all, Dean," the fat face tells me, as the door slides open to reveal a wide control room filled with monitors, fronted by an imposing glass window."Though it is, I'll admit, more common in those who have our power.Those like you, Dean."We step inside the room.Out the window, an unbelievable number of stars glisten ahead, so many that the 
blackness behind it almost can't break through."Why are we here?Where do we go when we die?Why is there something instead of nothing?"the fat man continues."Why do shoelaces always untie and headphone wires always tie, not the other way around?"He leads me towards the glass window.On a spherical chair by a dashboard, a young woman in blonde hair and 
tired smile greets us."Hey, Druk," she says, to the fat face."New guy?"Druk puts his hand around my shoulder again, looking over at the stars."When you are born with the power to teleport, it's not easy to close your eyes to the randomness and overall lack of attention of the universe.To the sheer rudeness of existence.That's why we exist.""What?""Is that not why you wanted to kill yourself?"the fat man asks."I  no.Sarah.My girlfriend, she "

"Oh, there's always a girlfriend.Always a job.A debt.In the end, though, it was the night sky.Right?It was the overwhelming feeling that all of this -- all you've ever lived, every star and every planet; it's all playing inside a theater with no audience.That feeling that whatever personality you think defines you is just a story you've been telling yourself, day after day.Just a mix-and-match of stimuli and neural connections.It's the feeling that God wouldn't care if you were a rock star or if you had cancer tomorrow."Watching the stars dance still in front of us, I think of Sarah, and of the nights alone in my room.I think of why I 
never told anyone of my power.Why I'd teleport to the top of the Griffith alone late at night and sit there, looking beyond the horizon for hours without end until sunrise."That you would try to kill yourself by looking up to the stars is such a giveaway, Dean," the fat man tells me."You have the heart of a poet, throwing yourself out into the nothingness that set you on this course in the first 
place.""What do you guys do?""The Ship of Fools drifts," the fat man tells me, as the blonde girl types something away in her control."Like 
Plato's allegory.We go on.Each and every one of us lost souls, crushed by the weight of a universe that seems so, 
so inexplicable for us, and yet so mundane to everyone around."Have you ever had a conversation that didn't feel real, Dean?Have you ever felt like you were talking about something, but it wasn't really you?It was just words, the things the other person expects you to say.Have you ever felt like no one really saw the real you?No one, not even once, really heard what you really think of the world?Of yourself?Have you ever wondered why there are bees?Why there is wind?""He's gonna have fun here," the blonde lady says, pushing a lever.The floor under our feet stars shaking."Tell me you didn't ever look at a wedding picture and thought 'why are they so happy?'Tell me the sight of a 
small child never made you think 'he's going to die, someday.He's an old picture on a family album waiting to 
happen.'"Druk turns my way."The real world is not for us, Dean.We're fools.You can't bring up the heat death of the universe at a dinner party.You can't talk about the illusion of the self at your niece's birthday."The floor shakes harder now.The blonde lady turns her head back."Ready for take off!""And where do we go?"I ask."Where does the ship go?"The fat face smiles its kind smile."To the edge of the universe.And beyond.To wherever.Wherever we can to find meaning, or hope.Or an answer.To a place where coffee and TV and magazines and stock shares are not the things you talk about at lunch break, watching the clock tick away moments of a life you fear you'll die without ever understanding.""Druk here is a failed poet," the blonde lady says, pulling another lever."And not a very good one, at that.But you'll get used to it."Druk turns to the stars in front of us."Did you set the course, Linda?""No," Linda replies, turning to face the window again."Excellent."I take a deep breath, thinking back on Sarah and my parents and all those people wondering what's for dinner 
down on Earth.I think of Twitter and Tinder and the new iPhone, and of ceremonial burials in old, ancient 
civilizations.With a soft pull, the stars ahead stretch into lines of light, showering towards us in exponential speed as the Ship 
of Fools drifts away into the endless nothing ahead.____________________

The Los Angeles Museum of Natural History was, by far, the dullest place on Earth.Cro was sure.It was also home.Does anyone have any idea the emotional impact that comes with people laughing at your small, exposed penis a 
hundred times a day?Does anyone have any idea how hard it is to stand still for twelve hours at a time?Fifteen on 
Sundays?No.No one does.Only Cro.Does anyone care when his butt is itching and it's five o'clock, but the museum only closes at eight?Has anyone ever gone three hours without scratching a butt itch?That shit gives you PTSD.But it was the only way.For so many years Cro had to hide.To live in the jungle.Had to endure being called 
Bigfoot by people who claimed to have seen him.Sasquatch.Abominable Snow Man.That one really hurt.He could understand the 'snow man' part, but Abominable was just mean.Living forever is no piece of cake.It was fine at first, but as time went on, Cro started to look less and less like other people.There was only so much makeup in the world.Mach 3 razors were only so efficient.No amount of shade and mask could hide his simian face, the hair coming out not only from where the beard is on a modern man, but from the ears and the forehead.There came a point where he had to go into hiding, or risk being burned as a witch.And then he heard about these new things.Museums, they were called, where they kept replicas of people like him.It was his shot.His opportunity to escape the jungle, to stop scaring the shit out of adventurers tracking through the woods past him while he was trying to take a shit.To escape being killed by a hungry puma, or worse.He sneaked into the LA Natural History on a Monday.Now it was fifteen years later, and the day-to-day hadn't changed much.Stand still like an idiot for as long as the museum is open.Have fun once it's closed.That's your day.Well 'have fun' As much fun as one can have at a museum, which is none.No fun.Zero amount of fun, especially when you've seen EVERY MOTHERFUCKING EXIHIBIT A THOUSAND TIMES.Yes, I know the penguins are in the south pole and the polar bears are in the north.Yes, yes, I know everything 
about the quirky people from Sentinel Island, who live isolated from modern world.Yes, I've seen the new display about ornaments from Central America.Yes, I've seen it.Seen it.Seen it.Seen it."I've seen it all*, Cro thought, staring at the frozen Homo Erectus on the display next to him."I'm super bored, 
bro," he said.For the past thee months, he had had more free time than ever.The museum was closed.It didn't open a single day, and Cro had no idea why.One day people just stopped coming.Three months of wondering around.Three months of being lost through the empty, eerie halls of natural things and cultures and stuff.And now it was getting dangerous, because the food on the cafeteria was running low, and no one was there to stock it up again in the morning."I think I might starve soon, bro," he said to the Homo Erectus."Or I'll have to risk going out into the city.But no.What if they find me?What will they do?"The frozen bro didn't reply."Yeah, yeah.You're probably right.I should just "

"Hello."Cro's eyes went wide.He turned around.A small girl, not more than nine years old, was standing by the T-Rex fossil, a Jack Skellington doll in hand, eyes 
locked on Cro.It took a lot of will power not to charge and break the girl's skull with a bone.Not that Cro wanted to kill kids, or anything like that.But that damned fight or flight response."Are you lost?"Cro asked."Did you parents leave you here?""My parents are dead."Cro blinked repeatedly."Who brought you here?""No one," the girl replied, simply."I came here to hide."Cro took a few steps towards the girl, his feet against the marble floor echoing loud all across the chamber.The girl stepped back, scared."I'm not going to hurt you," Cro said."What are you running from?""The monsters."Cro frowned."The monsters?""They said on TV it was because of the island.They said they found an island that wasn't on the map, and then something bad happened.""What happened?""The monsters," the girl repeated."Why are you weird-looking?""What monsters are you talking about?""The island was lost in time, they said," the girl continued."They said there were creatures lost in time that didn't 
die when they should have died.They said this is some weird 'phenomena' that they discovered recently.Things 
that don't die.""What things?""What does 'phenomena' means?"Cro crouched to the girl's eye-level."Do you have anyone that looks after you?"The girl shook her head.Her eyes flooded in red and water."Don't be scared.I won't hurt you.Is there anyone outside right now?"Again, she shook her head.Cro nodded."All right.I'll take you outside, and then we'll get you to I don't know, the cops, probably."He took her by the hand and they made way down the chamber.Past the long corridor.Past the African Mammals.Past the American Wildlife.Past Alaska Culture and Climate.Past the Bird Cage.They went down the stairs past the gift shop and crossed the main door into the outside garden.The sun blinded Cro instantly.It had been a while since he'd seen it.It was cold.And something was off about the noise around him.He blinked repeatedly, trying to get rid of the spots in front of his eyes.He couldn't put his finger around it, but last time he had been out, there was definitely something different about 
the way the city sounded.The clear blue sky faded into view, one less red spot at a time.Cro could feel the little girl's hand on his, pressing tight.Then he realized what was so strange about the noises."See?Up there," the girl said, pointing to the sky.There were none.No noises.No cars.No honking.No chatting, no distant stone crushers and no garbage trucks.Just birds chirping and wind howling.Jungle sound."Are you seeing it?The monster?"Cro followed the little girl's finger.Then he heard a high-pitched screech.Up in the sky, silhouetted against the mid-day sun, a pair of wings hanged perfectly still in relation to each other, 
gliding upwards.Between the wings, a long, green body ended in a beak the size of Cro's torso.He looked down at the little girl.Her grip on his hand was tighter."They called those Tecopactil," she said."On TV.When there was a TV, they called it that."On the fountain in front of them, the clean water reflected the image of the bird flying away against the sun."There are others," the girl said."Bigger ones."A low thud rang in the distance like a thunder, and a ripple in the water expanded in concentric circles.____________

The first time Death met Emily, she told him to go fuck himself."Your little engineering project is going to put me out of business!"Death had yelled, after 
materializing himself out of thin air inside her office."You arrogant mortal!""Fuck off," Emily had replied, apparently unfazed by the presence of a superhuman entity 
in her workplace."I got shit to do.""Whatever," Death replied."You think you're the first person to try to conquer death?Sisyphus sends his regards, bitch!"And Death vanished in a puff of smoke.Emily, Death had learned a few months before, worked for Pattern Corp, a giant Silicon 
Valley company working on uploading human consciousness to computers so as to render 
humanity immortal.She was the chief engineer in the project, and her ideas were getting 
everyone in the field excited about the prospect of technological immortality.Death, naturally, was kind of pissed off, because if she succeeded, it meant he was gonna 
be out of a job."Whatever," Death had said to Satan, on a bar in Hell, that night, "She's never gonna 
succeed anyway.People have been trying to cheat me for centuries.""Dee, buddy," Satan replied, ashing his cigarette on the floor, "you need to learn how to 
stop caring.You let mortals get under your skin too often.""Well, fuck, man, everyone hates me," Death replied."You don't know what it's like!Doctors, philosophers, physicists  they're all trying to get rid of me!You don't know that 
kind of hatred!""I'm Satan!""Exactly!Only religious people hate you.I'm hated by everyone.""Ah!Forget it, Dee.Here, have another drink on me."And Death did try to forget it.But more and more, as the years went by, Emily seemed to 
be getting dangerously close to succeeding in her project.A year after their first meeting, and in the same week she had been featured on the 
cover Times Magazine, Death showed up in her office again."So?How's your little vendetta project against me going?"Death asked."Just fine," Emily replied."We're testing consciousness upload on rats with great success.""You know, it's really ungrateful of you mortals to demand immortality from the cosmos.Why can't you be happy with the time given to you?""Why did the universe make us in such a way that we are conscious of you?"Emily replied 
(she was, in addition to an extremely accomplished Engineer, also a Philosopher, graduated 
in Harvard)."That seems extremely unfair.""Oh, unfair my ass!"Death said."Let me look at your papers."He turned her laptop his way and started going through the lines of code."You know, I don't see why you're so upset," Emily said, as he read on."If I manage to 
pull this off, you get permanent vacation.""That's not how it works," Death said, still reading on."If you succeed, I die.""Well, whatever.I hate you, and most humans hate you too.It's not our fault you come 
here all the time and pull us off one by one towards the the whatever it is that 
happens when you take us away."Death turned her laptop back towards her and looked up."What *does* happen after you take us away, anyway?"Emily asked."Nothing," Death said, still thinking about what he had read on the computer."Eternal 
nothingness.""Hah!And you expect us to accept this?Well, fuck you!I'm working on technological 
immortality and when I get it, we won't be at the mercy of your cruel, nihilistic hands, 
asshole!"But Death wasn't listening.He was worried.He read her code and, being an accomplished 
engineer himself (being a supernatural entity, he was an accomplished everything), he 
was starting to realize  she was close to figuring it all out.And more than that -- he was also impressed with her work (though he didn't admit it that night).Emily, it turned out, was smarter than he gave her credit for.In the following years, he showed up to her office more and more, and the animosity 
between them started giving way to an almost friendly banter.He'd show up, they'd have 
coffee, she'd show him her progress, he'd mock her, tell her she'd never beat him, she'd 
tell him to shut up and go drag some old ladies to the beyond, they'd discuss Philosophy 
and then he'd leave.One time they even spent the night together, though there was no funny business  it 
was just that it was late and Hell is kind of dangerous after the subway closes.Death 
slept on the couch.This weird relationship went on for years.Until.Until the day Pattern Corp went public with an official press release:

**PATTERN CORP SUCCESSFULLY UPLOADS FIRST HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS INTO COMPUTER**.Death read the news on Google, at Satan's office (no one else in the beyond had access 
to the Living World Internet), and he was devastated."This is it," Death told Satan."I'm out of a job.""Oh, come on.It was bound to happen.They're self-aware creatures, of course they hate 
you."Satan patted his back."I thought you were used to it.""It's one thing to be hated but now I'm useless" Death lit a cigarette and looked up at 
Satan."What will become of me?""I guess you'll die."Satan shrugged.&nbsp;

Death finally showed up at Emily's doorstep, one rainy night after her shift.It was a year 
now since they had last seen each other  he had stopped showing up since the press 
release."Oh hi," Emily said, at his sight."I missed you.""So I guess you win," Death said, stepping in and taking a seat."Congratulations.""Look, Dee," Emily said, going around her desk, "it's not what you think.""No, I get it.I've been hated my entire life."Death looked up at Emily."I'm used to it.You're just one more person who wants to see my end.Didn't know you were talented 
enough to accomplish it, though.Congratulations.""Dee"

"It's not my fault, you know?I didn't choose this job.I just I do what I'm told.""Dee"

"You think I like being responsible for the source of all human anguish?You think I cherish 
the fact that billions of people suffer because of me?"Death shook his head."It's a job, 
Emily.It's just a job.I don't take any pleasure in it."Emily sat by his side, but said nothing."I thought you liked me," Death said, after a second."I mean, I know not at first, but 
after you got to know me.I thought you understood.That I'm not a bad guy.""Dee"

"You know even Satan gets less shit than me?There are Satanists in the world.There are 
no Deathanists.""Dee, listen to me"

"And what's gonna happen to me now!?You know after all these people upload their minds 
to machines, they'll all live forever, and you know what'll happen to me!?I'll die!I'll face 
the nothingness I've imposed on billions!"Emily turned Death's face towards hers.She cleaned his tears."I don't wanna die, Emily," he said."I wouldn't mind it before, because everyone hated 
me, but but I got along with you.We had great talks, didn't we?About life and me
and how you're a big selfish bitch and I'm an uncaring monster" He paused."I'll miss it.I never really realized how much it sucks not existing, because I had nothing to miss.But now I have -- I have you to miss.""Dee"

"And now now now it'll all be gone forever!Now I'll be nothing!After people stop dying I'll stop existing!I'll ride towards that great endless void I've been pushing people towards my whole life!And I'll never" He got the words out through sobs: "I'll never see you again.""Dee, I'm going with you."Death paused."What?""The process.To upload your mind to the computer.It takes a year and a half."Emily 
smiled a sad smile."It takes five hundred days to upload your mind to a computer.We 
can't do it in less time than that.""What are you saying?"Emily paused."I'm sick, Dee.I just came back from the doctor.I have weeks to live.Maybe less.""What?""I won't be able to partake in the immortality I created," she said."It's ironic, if you have 
the right sense of humor, actually."Death stared blankly at Emily: That woman  that mortal  he had come to know, despise, hate, dislike, kind of tolerate, like and then really like over the course of years.His archenemy and his only friend."What do you mean?""I mean I'm your last job," Emily said."You said you're riding towards the great endless 
void.Well, I'll go with you.We'll ride together."He got up.He backed up against the wall."No" he said."No, I don't wanna take you.""You can't choose who you take, you told me that yourself," she said, getting up.She got 
close."I'm ready, Dee."On the computer screen behind her, messages from colleagues were popping up one after 
the other: *Congratulations!You're a genius!You changed the world!*

"I didn't tell anyone," she said."You're the only one who knows.""Emily, no"

"*Shh*."She put her finger over his lips.Their hips touched.She put her arms around 
him and leaned against his ear."I'm gonna miss so much about being alive," she whispered."You jerk.""Emily, I can't take you.""I'm gonna miss the sunlight," she said, her voice wrapped around a smile, "and the moon, 
and the way the cold wind feels on an afternoon's end at the beach.And the way my dog 
barks, and the way my children laugh and the way my husband smiles after I get home 
from work"

"Emily"

"And I'm gonna miss the ocean.Oh, Dee, the ocean is so beautiful, I wish I could just look 
at it forever.And sitcoms.Man, I'm gonna miss sitcoms.I'm gonna miss Seinfeld."Death presses his eyes, bit his lips."And and I'm gonna miss traveling.I'm gonna miss hotel rooms with chocolate bars on the pillows and tourist traps with overpriced wine in Europe.And I'm gonna miss meatloaf.God, I love meatloaf.And I'm gonna miss cold beer and warm hugs and fresh orange juice, Dee.""Emily, no"

"But I'm not gonna miss you, Dee.I'm not gonna miss you, because we're leaving together."Dee held her by the elbows.Pushed her away."Emily"

They looked into each other's eyes.She had beat him, she really had.Humanity was 
immortal.He could feel himself vanishing, even now.Could feel his legs weaker, his body 
giving in, the room, the world, the whole universe around fading and crumbling and falling 
apart in a swirling maelstrom, coming down like an earthquake."Let's go," Emily whispered in his ear, as the world fell apart."Let's go to that Great 
Nothing."He held her close.He was scared.So scared.The world spun and the floor shook under 
his feet.Everything was colliding.Everything was falling apart."Hold me, "Emily said."You shitty, shitty, awful thing.""Emily," he said in her ear, his voice barely a whisper."No.""I really, really hate you, Dee" she said."Asshole."They held each other close.The walls collided.The room crumbled to pieces and gave way to a darkness darker than dark itself.The floor gave in, and they stood there, close together, embraced, and for a second they were the only two things that existed in an endless Forever extending in solid darkness eternal every which way.Then silence.Her rhythmic breath.Her heartbeat."I hate myself too,' Death said.And they fell.

"You'll never know the joy and pain of being anything but who you are," Albert's father used to say to him, when he was a young man.For a long time, Albert struggled to make sense of that sentence.Did it mean that he could never be someone else other than himself, no matter how hard he tried?Did it mean that he shouldn't judge other people before he'd walked a mile in their shoes?Did it mean that he had superpowers and was able to transform into anyone he wanted, but shouldn't do it?Albert's father died, and Albert got old, and the sentence got old and dusty too, and got stacked where unimportant memories get old and dusty inside our minds, next to sepia pictures of old aunts and friend of friend's birthday parties.In addition to getting old, Albert also got married, and then divorced.He got married to a lovely, charming, beautiful and kind girl called Elizabeth, and, twenty years later, got divorced from a boring, old and indifferent lady named Elizabeth.Everything in between was transition, too slow to notice.The beginning was magic.Their first date was at a dance: Country Night at the Pink Room, a college ballroom between his and her dorm.A few weeks later they were serious.A few months after that, married.And the marriage started off great, too.The sex was incredible.The chemistry worthy of a Nobel prize.The conversations would often go on all night until the break of dawn.The families liked each other.His friends like her, her friends like him... it was the whole deal.But for Albert, the main thing -- the thing that made him fall in love again every day -- was Elizabeth's smile.The way she smiled with pointy teeth that didn't quite meet in the middle -- her vampire smile, was how he called it.There was *no way* Albert could love anything in the world more than waking up next to that smile every morning.But time, much like Radiohead fans and sociology teachers, has a habit of sucking the joy out of good things in life.As the years went on, the good times turned to ok times that turned to boring times that turn to bad times.The sex got mundane.The vampire smile less frequent.And Betty got *so old* too.Albert always thought couples wouldn't notice how old they got, since they grew old together, but he *did* notice.She was old.Old and wrinkly and full of spots.Worst of all, Albert realized, in front of the mirror, one morning after Betty had left for the supermarket: he was just was old as she was!And she could see him, every day!That old man, lying down in bed with her.Ugh.No, that marriage wasn't right at all.Albert finally acknowledged that he didn't love Elizabeth anymore the day he realized he couldn't remember when the last time he had kissed her was.Not a French, open mouthed kiss.A peck on the lips, even.He sat down and told her that he wanted a divorce, and her face was almost like relief, and what hurt the most was that it didn't hurt.Was that Betty's relief was also Albert's relief.He was happy she didn't cry.Happy he avoided the guilt trip.He was happy she didn't love him anymore, and that made him sadder than any tears she could have shed.It was a long, dragged out end of marriage that flowed swiftly like a river into an indifferent divorce.And so they got separate houses and separate lives.And she got married again, and he got married again.And her husband died and his wife died, because that is the natural course for things that love and get married in this world.And then Albert was alone again.Not long after was when he found out about the sickness.Their daughter told him, over the phone.Dementia.First stage.But getting worse.Should she send mama to a home, dad?No, she shouldn't, Albert said.Even though he still had an active life  even though he still had his poker club and his bowling team and Star Trek marathons on Sundays at his place  he still agreed to care for Elizabeth.To put all his life aside for Little Vampire Smile, if not for the love, which had long faded, for respect.For loyalty.&nbsp;

Time went on.First it was the little things.Where did she put her keys?Did we have dinner already?Who was that woman who called earlier?Then it got worse.We don't have a daughter, Albert!Where are we?Who are you?Get away from me!And Albert cried, but only after Little Vampire Smile had gone to bed already.He cried for her, and he cried for himself too, for all he was giving up of his own, already-not-far-from-the-end life.He cried wondering if she'd ever do the same for him.Then he'd feel guilty for thinking that and he'd cry more.If only they still loved each other.If only there was happiness there.That would have made it so much easier.But even on the good days, they just sat and watched TV in silence.Even when she remembered him  he almost wished she didn't.They had nothing to talk about.No jokes, no laughs.No chemistry anymore.And then she woke him up, one night: "Albie.Albie.""Huh?Betty?What is it?"He sat up on the bed.She was wearing a long puffy dress  one she hadn't worn in years.Her white brittle hair was combed back neatly in a ponytail.Her lips had red lipstick."What time are we going?""Going where, Elizabeth?"She looked taken aback.There was something in her eyes.Something he hadn't seen in years."To the Pink Room, silly!""The Pink " Albert paused.He studied her face.She was radiant.In her eyes, instead of the boredom and the sadness and the wrinkles and the mucus, he saw joy.A joy lost long ago."The Pink Room..." he repeated, understanding she was having an episode.But not any episode.She thought it was December 4th, 1952.She thought it was their first date.&nbsp;

Albert didn't speak for the whole drive.By his side, Betty wasn't speaking too  not out of a sense of weirdness for the whole situation, like him.She wasn't speaking in the sense that a shy teenage girl doesn't speak in front of her crush.Throwing him glances here and there.Trying to catch his eye in the rear view.Smiling a college girl smile behind a pale, old mask.They finally arrived at the place.The Pink Room was no longer a ballroom, as Albert suspected.It was now a dining hall for undergrads.He explained the situation to the night guard, slipped him a twenty and got the keys.&nbsp;

"Are we here, yet, Albie?"Albert closed his eyes and drew a deep breath.It was years since anyone had called him Albie.He turned the key and opened the door.It was dark and eerie inside, and their steps echoed like drums as they made way to the center of the wide room.Albert placed the music box on top of a counter under a sign reading 'Pizza'.He remembered the song still: "Strange Little Girl", by Cowboy Copas.He hit play and made way back to Betty, who was waiting, her hands pulling the edge of her puffy dress, keeping them up just enough that they didn't touch the floor."Hey, you" she said, and the tone of her voice brought Albert back sixty years.Awkwardly, he put his arm around her waist, and intertwined his hand in between her old, boney fingers.The song began behind them, echoing in a static hiss of bad quality radio.Albert stepped sideways, then back, then sideways, averting the tables and piled up chairs, leading Betty across the empty dining hall.The chorus went:

&nbsp;

*I don't know who she was*

*And I don't know where she came from*

*I only know there was an angel glow*

*In the eyes of the strange little girl*

&nbsp;

"I gotta tell you, Albie, I didn't think you'd ever ask me out."Albert pressed his eyes.He summoned from somewhere deep inside of him the will to play along."Why not, Betty?""I don't know," Betty continued, in the Texan accent that had long worn off in her real self."You go out with them boys from the upper side, and thems never seemed to like girls like me very much.I didn't think you even knew who I was."Albert leaned away to look Betty in the eyes."Well, I know who you are.I always see you going by the campus.Your hair pulled back, your white shoes..."

"Really?"she asked, smiling.It was true, and Albert smiled too."Yeah.I even told Sidney I was going to ask you out, first day I saw you.I nudged him and said 'I'm going to marry that girl someday'."Betty's smile widened, and Albert saw it then.The way her upper teeth grew narrow near the tips and almost-but-not-really touched the ones on the bottom.Through all the wrinkles and the age spots and the years of indifference, he saw her smile again, and he felt the way he felt when he was a young man again.He felt the way he felt the last time in the Pink Room.And the song continued:

&nbsp;

*She told me she knew of our quarrels*

*And I listened as she softly spoke on*

*She said true love is rare, so don't lose the love you share*

*And before I could speak she was gone*

&nbsp;

"What's wrong, Albie?Are you crying?""No.No," Albert lied.He pulled her close and, still slow-spinning her across the hall, leaned his head against her shoulder."I'm sorry, Betty," he sniffed."I'm sorry for all of it.All that could have been.I'm sorry for not trying harder.Maybe we could have made it work.Maybe we could have made *this* last longer.Not cashed our chips so soon.I don't know if it'd work.I guess we don't really ever know, right?We can't know what it's like to be anyone but ourselves.To live any other life but the life we lived."He sniffed again, no longer trying to hide his tears."But I'm glad I shared a bit of my life with you, either way.I'm glad we had tonight.I'm glad we danced and I'm glad we loved and laughed before we didn't, Little Vampire Smile."Slow, song beat by song beat, he gave in and Betty started leading the dance, swinging Albert back and forth and sideways and back and forth and sideways again.When Betty spoke, there was no hint of a Texan accent."I'm sorry too, Albert.And I'm glad we lived all that too."Albert opened his eyes against the shoulder of her dress.He pulled away, ready to ask her if she remembered.If she knew where she was after all.If she didn't really think that they were twenty years old again.When his eyes found her face, though, all he saw were the bright blue eyes of the girl with the vampire smile.The girl he loved so, so long ago, on that very same night.

"Hey," Annie said, after a few minutes of silent driving down the Pacific Coast Highway, 
"don't you think it's weird?""Don't I think what's weird?"Jim replied."You know... that you date Karen Willow."Jim rolled his eyes."Can you cool it with the ugly nerd jokes?I mean, I get it, I should be a virgin, nobody loves me, I play D&D with my idiot fri "

"No, no," she said, her voice drawled, muffled by the unlit cigarette dangling from her lips."I didn't mean it as a joke.I mean me too.I'm dating Brad Pitt.Don't you think that's weird?""Well, celebrities gotta date *someone* right?I bet everyone who gets to date them feels weird.Doesn't mean it doesn't happen.""No, but don't you think it's weird that *you and me*, the only two people not to be affected by the lag, also experienced highly improbable and major life changes just days before everything happened?"Jim considered this."Yeah, it is weird," he said."But then again so are jellyfishes, and *they're* real"

Annie chuckled, then looked away to face the road.Out the window, the sun was almost completely gone now, casting the last of a pale yellow light over the Pacific Palisades beach to their right as they headed south towards Hawthorne.Jim tried to think of something to say.He wasn't a big fan of uncomfortable silences, and this was quickly turning into one.They made him nervous, the silences.And the ironic thing was, the only reason most of his interactions involved uncomfortable silences to begin with was *because* they made him nervous, so he was always worrying about having something to say, which stopped him from actually being present in the moment and letting the conversation flow.With Karen there were no uncomfortable silences, but that was because Jim had assumed he was dreaming, so he was never self-aware when talking to her.He didn't worry about embarrassing himself or trying to come up with cool things to say or how he was presenting himself because well, it was just a dream, who cares?So he just said what was on his mind, no social-crippling filter.And that devil-may-care attitude was exactly what made him irresistibly charming to Karen, in the end.But now it was real life.In real life, Jim couldn't let go.With real-life social interactions, he was always like a bad actor, permanently forgetting his lines.Always trying to save face, never really being himself."This is it," Annie said, pulling over.Jim looked up at the imposing colossus that was the Space X headquarters.A big, warehouse-like building more wide than it was tall, with the letters SPACE X towering over large doors."Ready to do this?"Annie asked, but then she stepped out of the car and banged the door just as Jim was about to answer.(Which made him feel awkward).&nbsp;

They tried telling the lady in the front desk they were "visiting the company for a college project", but that didn't fly.Then they tried telling her Annie really needed to use the bathroom, but that didn't convince the woman either.Jim briefly considered slamming the table and proclaiming: "I AM ALON BUSK, ELON MUSK'S EVIL TWIN," but ultimately decided against it.Then, when all hope seemed lost and they were turning back and heading for the car, Jim caught a glimpse of him.In a buttoned-up shirt and black pants, stepping out of an elevator and heading down a back corridor.He saw the man's face for less than a second, but there was no mistaking it.Jim was an avid redditor.He had seen Elon Musk's face more times than Elon's mother."Mr.Musk!"Jim bellowed at the figure.Elon turned back briefly and gave them a thumbs-up, but didn't stop.He looked sad in an untrimmed beard and tired eyes."Is that him?"Annie asked.Then she yelled: "Mr. Musk, we have to talk to you!""I'm going to have to ask you two to leave," the lady behind the counter said, with an mean stare at Jim."Mr. Musk, we believe your simulation theory!"Jim tried, as the figure grew smaller and smaller down the corridor."We've seen the lag happening!"And then Elon paused.He turned back and, after a second's hesitation, fast-stepped his way towards Jim and Annie.He looked from one to the other, then, without a word to them, turned to the lady behind the counter."Take them to the Matrix Room."The woman nodded slowly.For a second, nobody spoke.Then Annie cleared her throat."Seriously?You call the it the Matrix Room?Like really?Do you have a dinosaur division called Jurassic Park HQ?Is your next spaceship gonna be called the SX-RETURN-OF-THE-JEDI?"Jim rolled his eyes.So did Elon.______________________

It takes a blink of the eye for the silhouette to disappear.And I'm all alone in the cryo-
chamber now.I feel my extremities going numb.My hands sweating.Thinking on my feet, I storm to 
the back.Running past bodies, faces frozen in peace flashing in front of my eyes up and down as I 
run, I reach the stairs to the downstairs level.I rush past the corridor, spotting shadows, figures everywhere.I don't stop to check if 
they're real or in my head.I go straight for the Cryo-Control.The doors take forever to slide open.I want to look back, but I don't.I can't.The light goes green.The door slides open.I step inside.*Where is it, where is it, where is it, where --*

I find the identity cards.Just as the door slides closed behind me, I hear the footsteps from the corridor.Slow.Approaching.I go through the cards, dropping half of them on the floor, looking for mine.*Fuck it,* I think, grabbing one at random.*Marla Chang.*

I run for the central computer.My hands shake so hard I can barely stick the card in.The footsteps grow near.*Come on, come on, come on, come --*

The screen comes alive at once.The metallic, over-professional female voice rings.*Marla Chang.Please place your eye 
on the retina scanner for identification.*

"FUCK!"I yell.I go back to the pile of cards, checking for my name.I can hear the footsteps like 

they're inside my head, they're so loud now.I find my card, finally.I stick it into the computer.*Charlie Reid.Please place your eye on the retina scanner for identification.*

I rest my chin on the plastic strap, all the muscles in my body begging me to look back 
at the sound of the footsteps.To see if someone's in the room with me.I keep my chin on the strap.*Identity confirmed.Please --*

I type.*'Lock Door CC-04.'*

I hear the soft click of the door locking behind me.The footsteps stop.I look back  I'm 
alone.I breathe out what feels like a week's worth of air.*Door CC-04 Locked,* the voice rings.*Ok. All right.I have time to think now.*

***WHAT THE FUCK?***

I run my hand through my hair.That man is not one of the hundred.That man is not my 
brother.That man is inside the ship.That man might just not be a man.I have to deal with this shit.I have to deal with this shit alone.I have to 

*I totally don't have to deal with this shit alone.*

I fumble through the papers by the desk, looking for the instruction manual.Here we go.I type, *'Override Cryo-Sleep.'*

The voice rings, *Please select capsules.*

Looking from the instructions to the screen, I type, *'Capsules 00-99.'*

Whatever that freaking man inside this ship is, I'm calling for backup.*Please confirm Cryo-Sleep Override.Capsules 00-99.*

As I'm about to type 'yes', the screen goes black.I wait.Nothing."Come on!"I yell, looking from the screen to the door behind me.*Charlie Reid,* the electronic female voice says."YES!YES, THIS IS CHARLIE REID!"I yell back at the screen."NOW FUCKING WORK!"*Did you kill your brother yet, Charlie?* the voice rings.I pause.That numbness in my hands, that weight in my chest.The screen's all black.*Did you kill yourself yet, Charlie?*

I hear a single footstep from outside.The voice grows high-pitched, and loses the metallic ring to it.When it speaks again, it's 
almost in a childish voice.*Don't you want to do what I'm asking, Charlie?If you don't want anyone to die, you 
should do what I'm asking.*

Then another footstep.*Do you want to die, Charlie?*

I hear scratching from the other side of the door._______________________

"Don't peek don't peek dont peek"

"I swear if you have your dick out when I "

"Ok, open your eyes."She does, and that crooked, slit smile fills her face as she looks down at the table."Oh 
my God, is this"

"Yeap.It's your boss'."She looks at the brain slices spread evenly over the silver plate, one on top of the other 
on top of the other cascading like waves next to the cream cheese and the onion rings."You *can* take a hint", she utters, still smiling."Is he -- ?""He's downstairs in the basement.Still alive.""Cool!I'll get him.""No, no", I say, holding her arm and stopping her."I'm your boyfriend.I'll get him."Her smile widens, and her eyes shrink like she's thinking 'oh my God he's the sweetest 
boyfriend ever'.At least that's how I read it.I make way downstairs and I think about the last year of my life, and, hey, things have 
been pretty all right.I've got a better job, new car 

And Sally

She's just awesome.I never thought I'd say this, but I'm in love.Really, for real in love.I reach the bottom of the stairs and hit the lights.The figure on the floor shrinks at my sight."Hey, Travis.Time to go upstairs."Sally's boss is thirty five, plays golf, inherited his company from his father and likes to grab Sally's ass when no one's looking then claim that 'it's just messing around, come on', when she accuses him of sexual harassment.Sally's boss, Mr. Travis here, is also missing nice big chunks of his Amygdala  chunks Sally's eating with bread and garlic sauce right now.I hope she's enjoying it.Never was a good cook."Mmmmpf, mmmmmpf, mmmmpf", Mr. Trevor says now, as I drag him up the stairs.I'm not much of a cannibal, to tell you the truth.I like the killing part.The eating not so much.But anything for that endearing smile, man.Anything.Love means finding common ground, right?I reach the dining room and Sally's eyes go up to me and she smiles."Here you go", I say, dropping Travis on the floor next to her.Sally's got her mouth full.She swallows, covering her lips with a napkin."You're the sweetest, did you know that?""Nah, you are the sweetest.""What did you do to me?Please.I'm dizzy and I don't want to die.I'm"

Travis' voice fades away.We didn't drug him, or anything, but his voice sounds like he's on morphine or something, and his eyes are heavy and glossy.I think it's on account of all those pieces of amygdala he's missing, but I'm no doctor.The back of his head is open like a battery compartment on a remote and his skull and brain are showing.There's blood dripping on my carpet I'm going to have to clean.Sally gets up, goes past him and kisses me on the lips, and it's wet of brains and lipstick."I love you.Do you know that?""Please take me home.I'm in pain.Please.""I love you, too, Sally.""Please.Call.An ambulance."Sally runs her hands through my hair, resting her arms on my shoulder and crossing her wrists behind my neck.She sits on my lap and turns to look at Travis."What should I do to him?""Whatever you want, honey, it's your birthday."Sally sighs, pointing her eyes up and tightening her lips like she's considering her options."I have a family please ambu-lance" 

"I think I want to stick a fork in his brain, see what happens.""Okey dokey."Sally gets up, grabs a fork and does just that to the back of Travis' skull.The result is Travis screams like I've never seen anyone scream before, and Sally laughs like I'm in love."Cool!"I watch her play with the pokes here and there, and I watch Travis spasming and turning and twitching with every stick, and it's like watching your girlfriend playing in the snow for normal people, I'm guessing.It's the equivalent of watching your girlfriend and a puppy, if you and your girlfriend are not psychos, is what I think at least.After a while, Sally's out of breath, and Travis is barely conscious."Hey, honey", Sally asks, as she drops the fork and grabs a handful of Travis' amygdala slices from the silver plate."You wanna catch a movie, tonight?"From my chair, I nod."Yeah, sure.""Please no more please"

Sally get down on her knees, crumples the brain slices to a single, dense ball of bloody matter and opens Travis' mouth with her free hand."Can you check the times for Inside Out?It's supposed to be really good."I take my phone out and I Google it."Please, have mercy"

Sally sticks the ball of Travis' brain down Travis' throat.Then she picks another handful from the silver plate and does the same, and then again and again, until Travis is all purple and swollen."There's one at six, but it's 3D", I say."Nah.What else?"she replies, pressing Travis' nostrils together."Eight-thirty.""Perfect", she says, just as Travis falls down from his knees to the floor, head first in front of my legs.Sally knee-steps her way close to me and kisses me on the lips again."Just perfect", she says."Like you."I smile.Travis makes throaty sounds between my legs and dies.

"It is my fate to save the world!"Sam proclaimed, raising pleading eyes to his parents."It so very much isn't," his father said."I'm not even convinced the world needs saving," his mom added."Honestly, things are fine the way they are.""Yeah.Lord Terror isn't that bad, when you think about it.""Right?I mean, he's done some good things.""He's called *Lord Terror* for God's sake!"Sam, protested, banging his fists on the table."He's so obviously evil!""Now, we don't go accusing people without proof.Not in this house, Sam.""Without proof what do you I he publicly announced that he wanted to destroy all of mankind as soon as he 
took over the government!"Sam exclaimed, getting up from his chair."His campaign slogan was 'DEATH TO 
EVERY SINGLE THING RIGHT NOW'.""Don't raise your voice to your father," Sam' mom warned, with a finger up in the air."He killed a batch of puppies with a mace in his acceptance speech as emperor of the world!How is that not evil!?""I mean, let's be honest, who likes puppies, really?""They do bark a lot, honey, your father has a point.Maybe you should just let this go, Sam.""What?No, they  I  you can't -- *are you seriously condoning puppy murder right now*?""We just think this is none of your business, honey," Sam's father said, keeping his voice down."Lord Terror 
might not be the best leader we could hope for "

"He exploded the moon last week," Sam deadpanned, eyes on his father."Like, we don't even know how the 
Earth's still functioning right now.""  like I was saying he might not be the best leader ever, but maybe we should wait before we form an opinion 
or start rebellions or, you know put our lives on the line.""What your father is trying to say," Sam's mom added, careful, "is that everyone deserves a chance before we attack them.Even Lord Terror.We don't know for a fact that he'll be a bad leader."Sam looked from his mom to his dad in disbelief.He grabbed the remote and turned the TV on.Onscreen, a newscaster addressed the public with a somber expression: "Lord Terror has just announced a new law that punishes smiles with death by chainsaw decapitation.Anyone caught smiling without proper government authorization is subject to "

Sam turned off the TV."Okay, he's killing people for smiling.Can I please go fight him now?"Sam's father exchanged glances with his mom.Finally, his dad spoke up."Sam, this has got to stop, okay?""Why!?Why are you so determined to keep me from fighting Lord Terror?Why won't you "

"BECAUSE WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO CEDRIC, OKAY!?"his mom bellowed, unable to keep it together any longer.A deafening silence took over the room."What?"Sam asked, after a moment."Cedric Diggory?That idiot who lives next door that thought he was the main character in his story!?"Sam remembered him.A tall kid that kind of looked like a vampire.Disappeared one day without trace after trying to fight some evil lord named Bloudevort, or whatever."Your mother is afraid you're falling for the same trap Cedric fell, sixteen years ago," his father explained."You think you're the hero of your story.""What?No, I "

"Cedric also thought he was the hero.His parents tried to talk him out of it.They tried to warn him.They said 'you barely showed up until the fourth book, honey, you're obviously going to die if you try to fight that noseless man.'But he wouldn't listen.He was convinced he was the chosen one.he was convinced the story was about him.""That's ridiculous," Sam said."Harry Potter was the chosen one, everybody knows that.""Yeah, in hindsight.But back then, Cedric was convinced he was the main character.""He thought he had plot armor.That he would survive anything.""Turns out, nope.He was merely a turning point in the story.A death meant to up the stakes for the main 
character."Sam looked from his father to his mother."No.. but I'm the main character in *this* story!"he said."I've been 
here from the start!I even have the most lines!""Honey...."

Sam frowned.His parents were throwing weird glances to one another."What?"he asked, careful."Sammy, You just think that because you've only been alive since the start of the chapter.""What?"His parents exchanged glances again."Honey look up."Confused, Sam turned his eyes upwards.There, right above his "It is my fate to save the world" line, he spotted 
the letters, bold and imposing and menacing:

**Chapter 32  A random idiot dies trying to fight Lord Terror**

"No no, it can't be" Sam said, turning his gaze back to his parents."I'm sorry honey"

"We tried to tell you"

"You're just a comic relief death in a dark comedy story..."

"No no, you're wrong!I'm going to prove you wrong!I will fight the evil of this world and I'll come back with the head of Lord Terror in my bloody, victorious arms!"And with those words Samuel Obviouslygonnadieson marched out of the room.And then he went to face Lord Terror and he died horribly and, at the end of chapter 51, Lord Terror was finally defeated by the actual hero of the story, who was called Benjamin, in case you're interested.And all was well.Well, not for Sam's parents, they were forever crushed by the death of their stupid son.But you know.For the world in general and all.

"Steve Carrell," I yelled, banging my hand against the table."How about Steve Carrell?The Academy loves a comic 
actor turning serious.""We talked to him," Zed replied."He's doing a movie about Wall Street and the housing market crisis.""Beautiful!An industry that makes billions every year and controls the mass media in the most powerful country in the world criticizing capitalism!It's a winner!""We also got Bryan Cranston doing a screenwriter blacklisted during the communist witch hunt.""Perfect!""And Michael Fassbender doing Steve Jobs  written by Aaron Sorkin, no less."Zed spoke that last part with pride, 
like he knew how good it was."We're covered, man!"I said, happily."We're covered!No way Leo's getting it this year!""And" Zed smirked, and leaned forwards, resting his chin on his hands on his elbows on the table (god, what an 
awful sentence)."We've got Matt Damon in Mars.""Fuck, Zed!"I leaned back, lighting a cigar."We've outdone ourselves this time!There is *no *way* Leo takes this 
Oscar."Zed smiled at me, lighting his cigar too.Another year, another success.We were covered.Or so we thought.&nbsp;

"What the fuck happened!?"Zed is yelling at me now, blocking the view of the TV, where the pre-show girl in the 
cleavage interviews Chloe Moretz on E!'s red carpet special."I dont know!I don't know!""I organized everything so well!I talked to producers, I talked to the actors, I moved mountains to get these movies made!And you're telling me Leo is the favorite!?How can that be!?""Zed, I don't know how it happened!"I stuff my face in my hands.Then I raise my eyes."Apparently people weren't in the mood for yet another Jobs movie, or watching Matt Damon get rescued again.Steve Carell wasn't even nominated for Big Short, and *not even Bryan Cranston saw Trumbo!*"

"Well, this is it.Humanity is doomed," Zed cries, as the lady announces that we're just five minutes away from the 
ceremony."The second Leo gets his hand on that Oscar, it's all over.He'll destroy the Earth."He pauses."We gotta do something, man!""It's too late now, Zed," I say, shaking my head."Let's just call our families.Say our goodbyes.""Unless" Zed stops, turning his eyes to me, his hand on his chin on his knee on the couch (fuck it, I'm wearing it with pride now)."What?""We could call *him*.""You don't mean"

"Yes I mean him."Zed gets up and takes three fast steps towards me, resting his hand on my shoulders."It's our only hope.""Zed, he's an alien.Plus, it's too late, the Oscars start in two minutes.""So?He can do it!""We can't put down a movie for Oscar consideration two minutes before the ceremony, Zed!""He can do it!"Zed roars."You know he can!""It's too risky, Zed.We don't know what he's capable of.""What other choice do we have!?"Zed's eyes are locked on mine.Dead serious.I sigh."All right, then.Call him."&nbsp;

One hour and forty minutes later, Zed and I are side by side on the couch, watching as Kate Mara finishes 
announcing the nominees for best actor in a lead role."It won't work," I say, quietly."It won't work, not even *he* can pull this one out."By my side, Zed watches in silence, his breath heavy and slow.Eyes locked on the screen.And the Oscar goes to," Kate says, tearing the envelope open."Leonardo Di "

The applause starts, but stops at once as a man storms the stage.He whispers something in Kate's ear, then takes 
the envelope from her hand and gives her a second one, identical."We're very sorry," Kate says, in a hush."But it looks like we have a sixth nominee."Clearing her throat, she tears 
the second envelope open."Well the Oscar goes to" Her eyes go wide, and a smile crosses her face."Matthew Mcconaughey, for 'Thirty Second Video Of Me Saying 'All Right, All Right, All Right' Uploaded To Youtube Just a Few Seconds Ago'"!The winning music starts, and the camera switches to Leonardo DiCaprio's incredulous face.Zed jumps up in the 
air."He did it!The motherfucker did it!"I cry, getting up too and hugging Zed as we watch Matthew climbing up on the stage.He takes the statue.Kisses Mara.Looks straight down at the first roll, frozen smile, eyes locked on Leo DiCaprio's face.He raises the Oscar up in the air.Eyes still on Leo.Takes a deep breath.Widens his smile.And says....

"Yes, but how *exactly* are the electrons simultaneously acting like waves and particles?""Well, Johnson," I replied, raising my eyebrow."The thing you need to understand about Quantum Mechanics is 
that it's based on thoughts.""Thoughts?""Yes, thoughts.So when you *think* of the electron as a wave, that's how it'll behave.When you think of it as a 
particle, it'll be a particle."Johnson frowned."What if I think of it as both?""Ah!"I replied."Excellent question."Johnson waited, but I didn't say anything."Are you going to answer it?"he asked, after a moment."Yes," I replied.He waited."Now?""Give me a minute, I'm trying to come up with something.""You can come up with something and then write it down immediately, you don't need to actually stall in the story, dude.""Yes but I want to convey the idea that I'm trying to come up with  oh, fuck it.Ok, if you think of it as both, what 
will happen is something called Quantum Entanglement.""What's that?""That's when electrons intertwine with themselves and become indestructible.One electron will behave as a 
particle, the other one as a wave, and they'll attract each other by the laws of thermo-gravitational distortion.""Thermo-gravitational distortion" Johnson whispered."Nice.""Thank you."I smiled."That's actually how antimatter happens," I continued."Two electrons  one behaving as a particle, one as a wave  intertwine, and they self-destruct, creating "

"You just said they are indestructible.""Shut up, I'm talking.They self-destruct, creating a big anti-electron, which is a particle of antimatter.""Woah, really?""Yes.The anti-electron is actually visible to the naked eye.""It is!?""Yes, it's a plum.""So every plum is an antimatter particle?""No, of course not," I replied."Don't be stupid, Johnson.""I'm sorry.""Only like thirty percent of plums are antimatter particles.The rest are plums."Johnson nodded.Silence took over the room for a second."How about the Theory of Relativity?"Johnson asked, after a second."Well, Johnson, relativity is like drinking eight cans of beer in three minutes.""How's that?""It feels wrong at first, then you feel good about it for a while, then it feels wrong again and you realize you didn't 
understand the part about time and space being the same thing at all.""Kinda lost track of that analogy halfway through there, didn't we?""You're pissing me off, Johnson.Cut it out.""What are you gonna do about it?"Johnson got up."Your story sucks anyway, dude.I'm out of here.""Shut up, Johnson.""You're a terrible writer."I thought of all of the electrons that compose Johnson."Shut up.You're gonna make me do something I don't want to.""And I bet I know how you're gonna finish it too, you hack."I thought of the electrons as particles."Shut up, Johnson..."

"You're turning me into a plum, aren't you?"Then I thought of them as wave."You're turning me into a big fat plum because you don't know how to end this story.You're ridiculous dude.Have 
you no shame?Can't you "

And then yeah, that.

"What the hell is this!?"I stop and turn around and this big British blonde dude is holding up my pack of Top Ramen like it's evidence in a court of law."Who the fuck are you!?"I ask, as politely as I can."Do you serve this in here?"the blonde bloke continues."Is this what you've been serving?Pre-packed noodles?""Dude, I work all day, I don't have time to make real noodles," I say."And who the hell are you to pass judgment 
on what I eat?"He goes around me and opens the fridge."What do we have here?""Dude, are you Mark's friend?"I ask."Who's Mark?"his echoed voice reaches me, as he fumbles around inside the fridge."My roommate."I pause."Dude, if you're not Mark's friend, then you got the wrong house, cause "

The man turns to face me, and his eyes light up."There's a roommate?"He goes past me and stares into nothing."What are you doing?"I ask."Alpaca and Mark take care of the business together," the man says, to absolutely no one, facing the wall."But 
what happens to the quality of the food and service when the quality of their friendship is growing sour?""Dude, like, what?"He turns back and screams at me."Look at this pear!"he says, grabbing a brown pear from the kitchen counter."Are you serving this shit!?Is this the quality standard of your establishment?"He throws the pear against the wall, and the noise attracts a sleepy-faced Mark, who emerges from his bedroom 
rubbing his eyes."Alpaca, can you please not " he pauses."Why is Gordon Ramsay in our kitchen, Alpaca?""Who's Gordon Ramsay?"I ask."The reality TV dude.With the kitchens," Mark says."What the hell is he doing here?"The bloke  Gordon, apparently  turns to the wall again."Mark doesn't agree with Gordon's suggestions to 
improve the kitchen at Markalpaca's restaurant, but Alpaca has had enough.Can their business survive both the 
kitchen and their personal problems?Find out next, on Kitchen Nightmares."Mark's eyes stop on me, and he looks as confused as I do."Dude, I think Gordon Ramsay is tripping balls."Gordon goes to Mark and towers over him."Are you aware that Alpaca is serving pre-packed ramen in your 
restaurant?Are you?""Dude, chill.""Are you aware you have bad pears here!?Do you think this is funny?""No, I "

"This is a nightmare."Gordon looks from Mark to me."You two better get your act together, fast."Then he turns 
to the wall."Will Mark and Alpaca be able to pull through and save the business and their friendship?"he asks 
the wall."Find out next, on "

"No, no, no," Mark says, stepping forward."That's it.Gordon, this is not Kitchen Nightmares, okay?You're 
invading our property and we're going to call the police if you don't leave.""What?I don't "

Mark puts his phone to his ear, then says: "Yeah, I have an emergency.Gordon Ramsay is in my house throwing 
pears at the wall and he won't leave.Yes, I am serious.Yes.Yes."He hangs up.Gordon looks confused, then heads for the kitchen and starts throwing our bread away, whispering 
something about bad quality wheat.Then there's a knock on the door."Finally," I say, going past Gordon, who's now smelling our orange juice and shaking his head by the stove, and 
head for the door.I open."Hey, officers.There he is."The two cops go by me and Mark and stop in front of Gordon (now tearing apart a cabbage and testing the 
texture with his fingers)."Come on, Mr. Ramsay.This way."Gordon turns to them."What?Who the hell are you?I'm not leaving!"The cops exchange looks.Then one of them turns back, goes past me, stops in front of the wall and, in a blank 
tone, states: "Next, on Cops: Gordon Ramsay doesn't want to leave the house, even after being intimidated to do 
so by the police.What happens next... might surprise you.""Oh, for fuck's sake," Mark says, rolling his eyes."What the hell is going on?"I ask.Before anyone can answer, there's another knock on the door.I open, and a 
cleverly dressed man in a monocle steps in."Okay, who are *you*?"He goes straight past me and stops in front of the wall by the cop's side."Alpaca has decided to finish his story with a Cops reference, playing with the notion that, rather than Gordon Ramsay being insane, it is the whole world around the main characters that has turned into a reality TV-like universe.Will that device work well for his story?Find out next, on Prompt Nightmares.""Now this is just ridiculous," Mark says."To make matters worse, Alpaca seems to have missed the cue to end the story with the meta-reference to his 
own story by having a Prompt Nightmares host invade the story and self-reference his own joke in an attempt to 
prove that his story is not dumb, but rather self-aware.Now he's just writing and writing, and the danger of never 
hitting a good spot to call it quits seems bigger than ever.Will he pull through, or will his story fall to pieces?Find out next, on Prompt Nightma "

All right I'm done.

I open my eyes to gray.Metallic gray, up ahead.My head hurts when I lift it up.Blinking the blur away from my eyes, I notice I'm in a 
circular room, not much wider than a prison cell.There are no doors.No windows.Just me and the metal bed I woke up in.I try pushing my mind back to what happened.I remember a bear.And Tracy on the floor.I remember a struggle.And the figure in the lab coat.The shadow against the Griffith on top of the hill comes rushing back to my mind  the coat flapping against the wind, the gun in hand, the hole in the bear's chest.And then nothing.Blackness.I get up."Careful, you're still weak."The voice is soft, and comes from behind me.And I remember it.I remember the voice.I remember it saying *Thank you for your 
time, Mr. Taylor*, and *Please bear in mind that it might take a while, but everything 
will make sense once the haze of The Box goes away.* I remember the voice saying all that, the last time I saw Amy and Zara.I turn around and it's him.The figure in the lab coat.It's standing right in front of me where there was nothing a second ago, as if materialized out of nowhere.I couldn't see its face back then, that day in the kitchen, but I see it now.Its thin and long facial, too smooth to be human.The narrow nose, and the eyes small and black with no white around them.There's no hair anywhere, and the head seems to grow narrower at the very top, like an egg.This is not a person."Please dont be startled," the figure says."I understand you are confused.""Who are  what are you?Where is my family?""Ah" the figure takes a step towards me."You mean your mom and your dad?""What?"I frown."No.I mean Amy.And Zara, my daughter.""My apologies," the figure says, "I thought you meant your *real* family.""My real what?What is going on?""Your planet was left in ruins," the figure says.Its voice it's almost like it's singing."This happened a long time ago.""Yeah, no shit.I noticed.""That wasn't our doing.We didn't destroy the Earth.Humans destroyed themselves, we saw it happen.""What?""It was your year of 1985, when the first atomic blast happened.We watched it from a distance.From our planet.We saw you kill one another.""What?No, I  I remember 1985.No one died, there were no bombs.""No, you don't.You don't remember anything from before The Box.The haze can last years, and you've only been out for what?Three months?"I press my eyes, trying to push the headache away."What's The Box?What are you saying?""You woke up three months ago in a forest, with no memory of your life and no idea how the world got to the state it's in.Isn't that right?""Yes," I reply.Then, "No.I remembered some things.I remember Amy and Zara.I just "

"I meant your real life.Not your memories from the Box."The figure looks me up and down."After humans were left to semi-extinction following 
the atomic war in 1985, we landed on Earth.It was my idea  and a lot of my people 
agreed with me  to help you rebuild your society."The figure looks down, and I catch 
something like sadness in its black eyes."But that wasn't what the majority decided.The 
people from my planet ruled that humanity was beyond salvation.That is wasn't our place to help you.So it was decided that we would use whatever few humans we could find in the planet for our own personal benefit."I didn't approve it.But I follow orders, after all.We abducted every survivor we could 
find in the post-war wasteland.We gathered them together right here, in this very place.""Wh-what is this place?""This used to be an observatory built by you humans," the figure says."But its since been...remodeled.To fit *our* needs.It's a lab now.""What kind of lab?""Like I said, me and a few others wanted to help the humans who survived the war, but 
this is not what happened.This is not what the majority decided.Instead, it was decided that you were to be used as guinea pigs."You were among the survivors, Mr. Taylor.We found you on that very forest you woke up in, wandering alone, not two days after the final bomb dropped.You were six years old.And we brought you here, along with all the other survivors.To experiment on you."I feel the room spinning around me, and the taste of acid rises up from my stomach to my mouth."There were a lot of different experiments we wanted to perform, so we separated you into groups.You and all the other children were assigned to The Box.Our virtual reality program."I blink, and Amy and Zara's smiling face flashes in front of my eyes."We wanted to find out how virtual reality could affect neural connections and the functioning of the brain in sapient species.The human brain is enough to ours that we could do that with you  instead of doing it to ourselves.I was *vehemently* against doing that but it was done anyway.""*What* was done!?""You were put inside The Box.""*What is the box?*"

"It's a simulation.It's a device that takes hold of your subconscious mind and derives 
from it a full sensorial experience based on your utmost desires.""What the fuck does that mean!?""It means that you spent the last thirty years of your life in a room just like this one, 
and everything you've ever experienced was a product of a computer software.That 
software was taking data from your subconscious to build you a perfect life according to 
your own, deepest desires."My breathing is shallow.Spots sparkle in front of my eyes in several colors."It means that your whole life has been imagined by your own brain, Mr. Taylor," the 
figure says."And The Box turned it into reality in front of your eyes.*That* is what we 
were researching.A way to perfect virtual reality so that everyone could live a dream 
life.That is the experiment you  and every kid we could find still alive on Earth  was a part of.""Amy's not real?"I ask, feeling my knees give in."Zara is not real?""They're as real as everything you've ever experienced," the figure says."It's just that 
the stimuli that propelled the electrical impulses that you learned to recognize as the two of them were generated by a synthetic device, not by a 'real life experience', like this moment, for instance."I feel my knees touch the floor."We kept you for thirty years.After that, there was nothing more for you to contribute, 
so we set you free, along with some others.I had orders to place you exactly where we 
had found you when you were a kid -- I guess that was meant to be some kind of noble act on the part of our species towards you.We dressed you exactly the same  we even put back in your pocket a note you and a little girl exchanged among yourselves when you were first brought in, before entering The Box.And we dropped you at the woods."I see the tears hitting the ground in a straight line from my eyes, and I can feel my 
chest going up and down in sobs, but I don't process the fact that I'm crying.Zara and Amy smiling flash again in front of my eyes.The day Zara was born.The park 
in front of our house.My friends from work.Amy's blue earrings.That joke my boss repeated whenever he had too much to drink.Amy.Zara.My life."I am very sorry, Mr. Taylor," the figure's voice rings above my head.I dont look up."If it was up to me, you would never have had to go through with it."I don't look up."There is, however, something I can do for you."And I look up."I can put you back in The Box."I wait, but he seems to be done."What?""The experiment is still going on with several other people.Despite my disapproval, this 
lab will continue functioning until every human being experimented on in here is dead or useless.Which means I can put you back 'inside' your old life."I pull myself up from the floor with difficulty."The same thing I'm offering you now, my partner is offering the woman that came with 
you.Tracy Morgan."I step closer to him.He's so much taller than me."You can you can put me back 
inside?Back with Amy and Zara?""Yes," he says, simply.He raises a thin hand.Between his long fingers, he's holding a 
very little transparent material  a square, almost invisible."This is The Box.All you 
need to do is swallow it and it will restart the program where it stopped.You'll have no 
memory of anything that happened in these three months.Not of the war.Not of me.Not of Tracy."I focus my eyes on the little thing in his hand."And if I don't?""Then you are free to go," the figure says."You are not our prisoner.The only reason I 
took you up here is because I knew, when I saw you and Mrs. Morgan climbing the hill, what you two were after.I thought it was only fair to offer you the truth.And this option."I look down, then up at the figure, then down again.Amy's sleeping face flashes in front of my eyes.Zara learning to walk.Her first words.My proposal to Amy at the bridge in Death 
Valley.Our house, our kitchen.Our bedroom.The rattling sound the Weeping Willow by the window made in the spring.Spazzino, that little restaurant in Sausalito Amy loved.And I think of the real world.The real, broken down, fucked up, vine-covered, rusted, 
blood-on-the-walls real world.And of Tracy.Fucked up Tracy, having to answer this same question right now, somewhere in a room like this.This mess of a world.This horrible world.This *real* world."You need to decide now, Mr.Taylor."I look up.The figure is still holding the transparent device.I think of Amy.I think of Zara.I think of Tracy.I think of real life and I think of happiness."Mr.Taylor?"I turn to the figure."Do you want to go back in The Box?"I take a deep breath.

The irony of the town's name  Quiet Water  was not lost on Hank when he first set foot on the arid and narrow path that served as its main street, ready to start his first day as town sheriff.There was no water in Quiet Water, and the town was anything but quiet.It wasn't once or twice that his friends had asked him why on Earth would he take a job in the most dangerous borderland district in the world, and to all of them he answered with vague nods or shakes and a tired smile."It will be a good change.""I like the weather.""The pay is good."And other such nonsense.He never mentioned Marylou and the kids, or how they died, or how he felt about how 
they died.On his first night on the job, a fight broke in Sally's Saloon, involving a high mage and a cowboy type with a Colt 44.Hank's first order of business, after shooting both of them point blank, was to forbid both firearms and 
use of magical force inside the town."This is Dodge City now," he announced, after gathering the town around the hanging pole serving as his stage."And I'm not half as sweet or patient as Wyatt Earp."His second night on the job, there were no recorded crimes in Quiet Water for the first time in seven years.In due time, Hank became known for what he was already known in La Estrada, where he last held an official 
position: an incorruptible, honest, violent, drunk, loyal, sharp-shooting, tobacco-chewing piece of justice with a thick southern accent.Honest, hard-working townsfolk loved him, both from the magical north and the industrial south.Hank was the man, they said.Hank brought peace to Quiet Water.Hank himself knew that the reason he came to Quiet Water had little to do with peace.On his third month on the job, a northern stranger caused a small commotion upon riding into down under an 
invisibility spell, materializing himself and his horse just by the revolving doors of Sally's and ordering a whisky and 
'some woman, or dude, or whoever is willing to hear me cry after sex.'Hank had been called, on account of the whole 'no guns no magic' law, and he crossed into Sally's to find the man 
on a faraway table by the piano.The piano man, Bilson, sat in a corner by himself, cowered and grumpy-looking.The stranger had one hand around a glass of whisky, the other hovering in front of his eyes, fingers moving up and down, and the piano keys, a few feet away, banged themselves as if played by a ghost.Chopin's Nocturne."What's all this?"Hank asked, and all heads turned towards the stranger."You the hooker?"the stranger asked, still playing the piano from a distance, eyeing Hank up and down."A little 
old for my taste, but let's do it."He was young, sporting a thick mustache that would make most men jealous.But not Hank.The crowd waited eagerly to see how Hank would react to this man, this jokester who waltzed into a man's town 
without respecting a man's rules.And not just a man, Hank.But Hank knew better.He was expecting the stranger, though he doubted the stranger was expecting him."Why don't we talk in my office?"Hank asked, to general disappointment of the drunken crowd.&nbsp;

"What's all this about?"the stranger  that Hank knew was known as Trickster, asked, juggling bullets around over
his hand without really touching them  hovering over a few inches from his dancing fingers, like he did with the 
piano."Prince Charming," Hank said, and the name brought with it a gush of bile to his throat and flashes of a night Hank 
drank daily to forget."You know him.You were part of his gang.I knew you'd come here sooner or later, because you have a potion contact across the border, and your have a deal with Sally to conduct your business there."The Trickster didn't say anything for a long time.Then he sneered."Yeah.You gonna have me arrested?I don't 
ride with him no more, you know?""I know you're not part of his gang anymore.""Oh," the man smiled, "such well-informed sheriffs you got here."He paused."How d'you know?Little magic northern bird told you?""No.You weren't there when his gang killed my wife and kids."The man's smile froze, then faded.The juggling bullets fell to the table with loud clacks.Hank leaned forward."I don't like you.I don't care if you're not a criminal anymore.I don't believe people change, 
and that goes for normal and magical assholes alike."The Trickster waited, silent."But you weren't there when they killed them, so I won't kill you.And I know you can find him, and I know you can do things I can't do, and I know you left the gang and you're out of money, that's why you risked the potion deal here even though you knew the town was under new management."Hank fiddled with the badge on his chest.He went into his drawer and pulled the wanted poster he had saved for the occasion."Prince Charming and Gang are worth ten grand.You help me find and kill him, it's all yours."Trickster eyed Hank for a long time.Then he leaned forward and pulled a cigarette from Hank's pack and lit it, puffing a thick cloud of smoke over his head.He said, "You mean half of it is mine, surely," he said, matter-of-factly, but with a hint of somberness in his voice."No," Hank said."All of it.""What do you get out of it, then?"The Trickster asked.Hank leaned forward and grabbed his cigarette back from between the Trickster's lips and pulled a drag.The filter was moist and soggy, but he didn't give a shit."Revenge," Hank said, spitting a ball of smoke from his gritted teeth, "is what I get."

*Tomorrow is the day I'll find Amy and Zara.*

*Tomorrow.Tomorrow.Tomo *

"David!"I wake up startled, hand on my knife."It's ok.It's just me."Tracy's face comes in and out of focus in front of my eyes.She's got a hand towel to my forehead, brushing gently."You were having a nightmare."Slow like an old Hyundai, my brain starts working again."No," I mumble, taking the 
towel from her hand."No, I wasn't.""Have you thought about what we discussed yesterday?"I sigh, blinking myself awake.Yes.I did, as a matter of fact.After dragging the crazy guy's body outside and clearing the house, I gave some thought to her idea.It's not the best in the world, but I really can see no other choice.And tomorrow has to be the day I find Amy and Zara."Yeah," I reply, getting up.I head for the window."Yeah, I think we should do it.""Good."Tracy stops by my side, leaning against the frame too.It's a gray day.Not like rain, but not like sun either.The sky's that dirty shade of white it gets when the sun's trying to pull through the clouds but can't do it.Like bright cloudy, if I had to name it.The air is still."Did you sleep well?"I ask."As well as a person can sleep in a house where the walls are painted in blood with their 
name.""Yeah"

Tracy wants to climb the Griffith trail.There's absolutely no indication that there will be 
any answers on top of the hill where the Griffith Observatory lies, except for the word 
'Griffith' painted next to our names on the wall.Griffith can mean a thousand things.It's the very definition of a long shot.But we're out of short shots.And it gives us 
something to do, at least."Do you wanna eat before we leave?"Tracy asks, turning sideways from the window to face me."What do we got?""Dead rats."I sigh.She smiles."I can boil them."I sigh again.&nbsp;

The way up the Griffith hill is long and steep and dirty, but it feels good to step away from the city.We climb upwards and upwards in silence, watching the Hollywood sign (which reads only YWOOD now) following us from a distance.It feels good, though, being here.The sound of the birds.The smell of grass and mud.Looking around, we can't see any rusted cars.No bodies or broken down houses with no roof.Here on the trail, it's like the world might have never ended.Like we're just taking a friendly hike, and then I'll go home to Amy and Zara."So what's it like, having a family?"I turn my eyes.Tracy's hair is glued to her forehead and she's panting by my side as we 
walk."It's nice," I say, quietly."It's... safe.But it can be challenging."Her shirt's ripped on the side, exposing a good chunk of her abdomen.Her belly's tanned 
and shaped like an L.A.Fitness ad.The girl's fit.Well, so am I. I guess that's what living the way we do does to the human body.There's really no room for extra fat when you're walking and climbing and running from predators and chasing prey all day.*'Post-Apocalyptic Workout  Get Ripped In The Wasteland.'*

"What about being a big Hollywood Exec?"I ask her."I don't know it gets old.But the pay's good," she says, with a half-smile.We keep going in silence for a while.Then she says, "All right, I was bullshitting you.It's amazing.I had dinners with people like Kevin Spacey and Brad Pitt on a weekly basis.I got to weigh in on casting for multi-million dollar super-productions watched by millions of people.My name was on the credits of Oscar-wining pictures.I had a freaking Penthouse in Beverly Hills.It was awesome.And a family would never let me have all that."I laugh, maybe for the first time in months."Yeah"

"Sorry if that makes me sound like an asshole.I don't mean to say that *your* life was 
shitty, I just "

"No, I was bullshitting you too, I freaking loved being married," I reply, truthfully."I 
just I didn't wanna say anything cause I was afraid of sounding arrogant, because you 
never married."She laughs now too."Guess we both had perfect lives, didn't we?""Yeah" I smile.Then I think about this for a while."Actually, yeah isn't that weird?That we "

But I don't finish my thought, because Tracy's gone.I hear the noise and I turn back in time to see the bear rising on its hind legs  its 
imposing, gigantic figure shadowing Tracy's body on the ground."Tracy!"I get near, and the bear turns to me.It backs away for a second.Then it realizes its three times me size and steps forward.Tracy gets up.The bear turns to her.It's in the middle of us now, looking from Tracy to me.I pull 
my knife.A lot of good it'll do, I know, but what else do I got?Tracy pulls hers too and charges for the neck, but the beast is faster.With an effortless 
wave of its paw, it brings her to the ground again.The animal steps towards her, mouth open for the bite.I charge."Over here, asshole!"I plunge the knife in its back, but all it does is piss him off.He turns to me, opening his 
mouth in a deafening roar.It rises up on its hind legs again, staring down at me.Tracy's unconscious by our side.My knife is still plunged on the bears' back.This is how I die.I take a deep breath, close my eyes and wait for the blow.*Today.I'll find Amy and Zara today.*

But the blow never comes.When I open my eyes, the Bear is on the ground, smoke oozing out of a 
basketball-sized hole in its chest.Tracy's by its side, still out.Slowly, I turn around, searching for the source of whatever it was that saved my life.I see it framed against the silhouette of the Griffith Observatory, up above against the cloudy sky, in the distance at the end of the trail.A tall figure holding a weapon.Its body wrapped in a white lab coat flapping in the wind._____________________

The trees were huge, comically huge, video-game huge.They sprouted from beneath the clouds under them and 
blossomed in huge umbrellas of green, yellow and red leaves over their heads, casting cobweb shadows on the sunlit path under their feet.Henry walked carefully.There were no railings on the edge of the path  just the fall, the endless fall that 
disappeared in the thick clouds below."If you fall, you don't die," Amy said, with a smile back at him."The clouds hold you, like pillows."It was something out of a fairy tale.The pink sky.The grass and gravel path that snaked through the giant trees, 
suspended mid-air like a street lane held up by magic.The smell of honeysuckle and roses and rain in the air, the bird chirping.Everything all almost a caricature of perfection."Here," Amy said, and she made a sharp turn with the path and soon they were climbing down ancient-looking 
stone steps coated in vine and dry leaves, the faint sound of a waterfall reaching them from somewhere out of 
sight down under."Careful, don't slip," Amy said, and she took Henry's hand and he followed her."Over here."The wide open space with the giant trees gave way to a more enclosed environment, with smaller but denser trees surrounding the stone wall they were climbing down.Soon they climbed straight down through the thick white clouds and reached the ground and Henry realized they were in a forest.A lush forest of green and brown.The smell of wet dirt and fresh wood invaded his nostrils, and he followed Amy to a little path on the ground that snaked towards a house in a clearing, a wooden house with a chimney coughing up smoke like some drawing in a children's book, some feverish fairy tale dreamland come to life in front of his eyes."It's"

"Unbelievable," Amy completed."That's what I thought when I first saw it too."They stopped in front of the porch.Henry looked around, then down."We can have kids here," Amy said."There's time and space to have kids here.To grow old and raise them and be 
happy.Forever.""Amy" Henry climbed the steps and sat on the suspended bench on the porch.Amy followed."I don't know.""What don't you know?This is literally magic, Henry.We can live forever here.""Yeah, but do you want to?"Amy laughed."Henry, who *doesn't* want to live forever?I mean, I get not wanting it in that shithole that we call real life, but here?"She motioned around her, encompassing with her hands the whole idyllic scenery surrounding them."It's perfection.Forever.""People were meant to die one day, Amy.People weren't meant to live for pleasure forever, we're not orgasm 
buttons.""Henry," She knelt in front of him and took his hand on hers."People were not *meant* to anything.We are 
accidents.We weren't even supposed to be sentient, we're like an abortion of nature.Our self-awareness is an accident, a side effect.We shouldn't know we exist.But we do.We know we are alive and we know we must die and this place this place takes all of that back.We live forever here.We are *happy* forever here.The scenery, it's always changing, there's giant futuristic cities, there's ancient medieval castles, there's magic forests, interesting people, all new, new, new, never a boring day, and forever!It's everything a person could ever want.""It's not natural," Henry said."It's not what's *meant* to happen.""Henry, what is meant to happen is you and I and every other human being ever will die and then the universe will 
die too and it will be like nothing ever existed!"Amy was getting angry now.Even the pink sky and the golden 
sunlight around and behind her seemed to be gathering an ominous hue, like mirroring her emotions."What is 
*meant* to happen is the source of all human suffering.We are insignificant outside of this place!We are absurd!""Maybe we're meant to be insignificant.""STOP SAYING MEANT LIKE ANYTHING IS 'MEANT' TO HAPPEN.IT'S A MADE UP WORD."She calmed herself.She 
put her hand to her heart and breathed deep."Nothing is *meant*.There is no order in the universe save for the one you put there with your own eyes.There is only chaos, Henry, chaos and forgetfulness once everything blows away and dies.Is this what you want?For our love to have meant nothing?Our life?Because when we're both gone, that's what it's going to be like.Nothingness."Henry didn't say anything.He was crying, but he didn't say anything."I love us," Amy said, taking his hand again."I want us to last forever.I don't want our love limited by the 
indifference of the universe that bred it in the first place."She sniffed her tears too."I want you and I for longer 
than reality permits.And this is how we do it.This place.Whatever it is.Real or not.Insanity or not.It's here.It's 
forever.And I want to share it with you."Henry looked down.Then he looked up, and the sky was gray now, and a soft rain was trickling down between the 
leaves of the wall of trees behind and around the house."I'm sorry, Amy," he said."I'm sorry, I can't."She got up.She stepped back."I'm staying," she said."I'm not leaving here."Henry nodded."Okay."How could he blame her?She was the one who was dying.She was the one with months to live, in the real world.He thought she was wrong, but how could he judge her from his position?From his place in life, his healthy body, his healthy mind.Deep down he'd like to think he'd be different, but would he?Didn't he too, like everyone, harbor the illusion that he would live forever?Didn't he make plans and live his life like he wasn't going to die one day, despite his 'logical' mind knowing it fully well?Didn't he too bury this truth?This truth that Amy had to dig up from the ground and stare at, that morning the doctor gave her the news?No, he couldn't judge.He could disagree, but not judge.He got up and started for the path, then he turned back.She was crying, her arms dangling by her body, 
powerless, weak, fragile."Why do you have so much love for this universe that brings you nothing but pain?"she said."This reality that doesn't love you enough to even let you in on itself and its truths.That's not even honest with you.This world that keeps you in the dark and then kills you -- is that the world you love?"She cried harder, then she stopped."Is it worthy of it?"Henry shook his head."It's the only world I've ever known," he said."And it was good enough for my fathers before me."He climbed the stone steps alone, and alone he made way back through the giant trees under the now pouring 
rain and the heavy skies, and then he crossed and emerged back into their house, alone now.The portal closed behind his back and she disappeared  her and her memory together.Her parents, their friends, 
no one remembered her anymore after that, just like she said it would happen.Those were the rules.That was the price you paid for that perfect universe -- no coming back, no footprints left in reality.She disappeared from his reality completely.And Henry carried on without her for sixty-two years, and when he died, it rained for the second time over her 
house in the woods in her lonely, perfect world, but she didn't know why.

Nova looked up at the camera."Earth has always been the faded blue dot in the distance.It was never home.I've heard the stories of cities and oceans and people and all that, but to me it was just the pale blue dot.Part of the background.And now look at me spinning alone in the darkness, watching that blue dot grow bigger and bigger out the window."Nova paused.Then she sighed."I suppose I better do what this video log is supposed to do.Log stuff.Well, I'm 
one day away from Earth now.I've been sent here on a scouting mission because probes have detected, and I 
quote" she looked down at a tablet on her lap, then up at the camera." human-like activity.Human-like why 
not human?Human-like makes it sound so spooky."She chuckled."Anyway, solo mission.I'm supposed to look around and come back with information on what the hell is going on.You'll hear more from me tomorrow, when I land."&nbsp;

"Hello, Nova here again.I just broke atmo, thought you all should know.Earth looks fine, at least from a distance  
abandoned, old and unused for centuries, like my genitals.Sorry, that was probably unprofessional for an official 
report."Nova looked around, then back at the camera."Then again, what are you guys gonna do?Fire me from a 
fifty four million kilometers away?That'd just be rude.Anyway, gotta go, I'll log in again after safe landing."&nbsp;

"All right, I'm here.Landing was fine.About to step out of the ship.Still no sign of life.Be back soon with info."&nbsp;

When Nova's face showed up onscreen again, it was sweaty and red.She wasn't wearing her helmet, but the 
spacesuit looked dirty and ripped."Okay, I can't get the *fucking* communication live, so I gotta do this at least."She spoke between shallow breaths and nervous glances at the hatch of the ship."There's fucking things I 
don't.... people, but not people.I don't know what the fuck these guys are, but "

*TUM* out the hatch.Nova turned another worried glance back."Look, they fucked up my ship.I can't get it to 
work, I --" *TUM*, "-- I'm trying to send this so at least you'll know what the fuck happened here.They're gonna take me.They're gonna take me and" Nova paused, and it looked like she was making a big effort to swallow tears.Her voice was breaking."They're gonna take me and they're gonna kill me.Don't send a rescue mission unless you're sending a *fucking army*.Even so, I'll probably be dead by the time they arrive."*TUM.* *TUM.* The metallic hatch started bending inward with the bumps from whatever was on the other side.Nova looked up at the camera, red eyes."Tell my daughter that I love her with all my heart."Nova looked back.Another *TUM* and the sound of harsh wind filled the recording.Something made Nova trip 
back and she fell over the camera, and, with a hiss, the video ended on a blue screen.____________________

Michael looked down from the finished recording on the screen of his ship.He headed for the window to watch Earth coming closer.They were about to break atmo."Don't send a rescue mission," Nova had said."Unless it's a fucking army."Michael poured himself a drink and leaned against the window, watching Earth grow bigger and bigger.He was the fucking army.______________

When Seth's ex-girlfriend started barking after he said, "You know, you're a real bitch, Darlene," he knew something was wrong.Or right.It took exactly seven minutes from the moment he realized what was happening to him to the complete loss of his 
sanity.Then five more months of "You know, this quarter is actually worth ten million dollars," before he was living in a 
four-story mansion in Hollywood Hills.Seth finds himself on a cold Tuesday in a warm Jacuzzi shaped like his penis.Alfred, his drinks-and-foods- servant  whose real name Seth had forgotten long ago  stepped into the room."Mr.Seth.""What is, Alfred?""I was wondering if you were expecting someone."Another Alfred  this one Seth remembered was called James, before he convinced him that no, his name was 
Alfred like the others, and yes, he was to serve Seth until the day he died because Seth was Jesus  stepped in."There's a gentlemen waiting for you downstairs, Mr.Christ.""Don't call me that," Seth said."Who is it?""He didn't say, sir.""What does he want?""He didn't say, sir.""Did he say anything?""He said 'please bring me Seth.'"Seth sighed, pulling himself from the Jacuzzi.He wrapped his body in a silk robe and made way down the stairs.By the fireplace, a tall man in an overcoat smoked a cigar.He turned a wrinkled, hard face as Seth reached the last 
steps into the living room."Seth Wisher?""That's me.""We need to talk."Seth was tired."No, we don't," he said, turning back to the stairs."Yes, we do, Mr.Wisher."Seth paused.This was the first time in his life someone had contradicted him.He turned back."What did you say?""I said 'Yes, we do, Mr.Wisher."Seth frowned."Wait."He made way down the stairs."I am Brad Pitt.""No, you're not.You are Seth Wisher," the man replied, simply."All right."Seth stepped closer to the man."What's going on?""I'm into your little secret," the man replied."I am like you.""People believe everything you say?""Well, sort of.I'm the opposite.I'm the Bullshitter.People think everything I say is bullshit.""Bullshit."The man smiled."I'm here because there are more like you.And you need to meet us.Susan, come here please."A blonde woman in her twenties stepped out from behind Seth's life-size sculpture of himself."Is everything all right, Mr.Wisher?"Bathroom-and-garden Alfred called, emerging from the bathroom door."Alfred, come here," Seth said, eyes on the cigar man."Say something to Alfred, Bullshitter.""Alfred," the man smiled, "I am sitting on this couch.""This man is not sitting on this couch," Alfred said, turning to Seth."Interesting," Seth said.He looked up at the blonde woman."And what's your deal?""I'm Half-and-Half girl.""Meaning?""People believe the things I say only half the time.""That's true," Alfred said, nodding emphatically."I never know when it's one or the other, though.""She's lying," Alfred whispered."Shut up, Alfred.""There's more.There's Damian One-in-Three.Jeremy Half-Lie.There's "

"Jeremy Half-Lie?""People believe what he says, but only a specific part."Two men stepped into the room from the front door, smiling."Hello," one of them said."I'm Jeremy Half-Lie.""He's Jeremy," Alfred said."But he's not Half-Lie!""See?It's pretty weird," the blonde lady said."It's most certainly not weird!"Another Alfred cried, from the top of the stairs."Yes it is!"Bathroom-Alfred argued."And of course," the Bulshitter added, waving at the front door."There's Insanely Truthful Kyle."A young man, not more than nineteen, sprouted from the front door, all smiles."Nice garden," he said, with a 
thumbs up to Seth."THAT IS THE NICEST GARDEN I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!"Bathroom-Alfred bellowed, throwing himself through 
the living room window glass out to the garden."I CUT MY THROAT ON THE GLASS!SOMEONE HELP ME!""Is that it?"Seth asked."is that everyone?""No," Susan Half-and-Half replied."Yes it is!"Drinks-and-food Alfred intervened, stepping down the stairs."No it isn't!"The other Alfred argued."There's more like us," Damian One-in-three said."Yes, there are," Alfred said."Yes, there are," another Alfred said."No, there aren't," said a third one."I think there might be more like them," one Alfred said to the other, who nodded, chin resting on his hand."This is crazy," Seth said, looking around."You're all crazy.""DIE, NAPOLEON!"Alfred screamed at Foods-and-Drinks Alfred, banging his head repeatedly against the marble 
wall."No!Stop, Alfred!No one's crazy!Let's get serious here."The Alfreds stopped.Seth looked from Susan Half-and-Half to Jeremy Half-Lie to the Bullshitter to Insanely Truthful fuck it I've lost track of this story like three paragraphs ago.

The old man turned the handle and the hatch came open with a metallic click and a thud.The sunlight blinded Michael at first.Then, little by little, the world outside came into focus.Feeling the pull of Nova's wrist tied against his with every step, he crossed to the outside.His feet kicked sand.They were in the desert.Michael looked back.They had just emerged from a hole on a dirt wall on the bottom of a large cliff, dry branches and rocks dangling all the way from the ground to the very top.The old man emerged from the darkness of the tunnel just after them, a smile still clinging to his face.Michael turned to look at Nova, then at the vastness of the desert ahead of them."Don't try to run away just yet," the old man said, as if reading Michael's thoughts.He took a step forward, then pulled a knife.Michael stepped back."Relax," the man said.He took a careful step towards Michael and Nova and lowered the knife to the rope tying their wrists together."There," he said, cutting the rope."That's better, no?"Michael and Nova pulled away from one another.Nova turned to Michael."Where's your ship?""I don't know," Michael said, looking around."I'll tell you where you ship is," the old man said."In due time.""Why are you doing this?"Michael asked.The sun against his eyes was making it very hard for him to see the old man clearly, and the sudden heat contrasting with the relative coolness of the underground tunnels they just emerged from was beginning to make him light headed."Do you mean jailing you?"the man asked."Or setting you free?"Neither Michael nor Nova answered.The old man took a single step forward, stopping in front of them."I know you are not demons.I know you are people, like we are people.I know you are the sons of the sons of the sons of the people who left the fathers of my fathers' father to die on Earth.I know there's nothing mystical about you two.""How do you know how to speak English?"Nova asked, finding her voice at last."The old ways are not completely dead on Earth," the man replied."Not in my family at least.We teach our sons and daughters the language of the old days.As we teach them the truth behind the myth.""What do you mean?""I am the equivalent of an atheist, in this world," the old man said."Which is ironic, given my clerical position.Nevertheless, I am a nonbeliever.I know how the world ended up the way it did  the truth behind the legend.My father taught me all of it.""Okay," Michael said, shaking his head."What does this have to do with us?You're gonna leave us to die in the sun because our great grandfathers screwed you over?It's not our fault."The man chuckled and looked down at his feet."Die?No, no.You're not the ones who are going to die."He looked up again, and the laughter died in his lips."I am."For a second, no one said anything.The hot wind whistled between them and lifted thin waves of sand knee high, almost as if making a statement about what the old man had just said."You're gonna die?"Nova asked, raising an eyebrow."You've become so powerful," the old man said, as if he hadn't heard Nova."You have no idea the power you have over those people.They fear you.They fear you so much they base all their lives around it.Did you know the air is not toxic up here anymore?For years, already?We ran tests, it's perfectly safe to go back to the surface.But they won't do it.They won't do it because they think it will anger the demons up above.The demons inside the metal spaceships hovering between the stars."The man looked from Nova to Michael, and now he looked sad."They pray every night for your mercy.They fast and they mutilate themselves.When a family member dies, they beg for your forgiveness, thinking it a punishment from the above."The man chuckled grimly to himself."And all the while you're just people living in another planet.Eating and talking and shitting like people eat and talk and shit.No idea the amount of influence you still have on us."Michael let his eyes wander behind the old man at the entrance of the tunnel.The hatch was still open.The darkness inside seemed almost palpable  a solid darkness."People shouldn't fear their Gods," the old man said."That's not what Gods are for.Which is why you are going to kill me."Michael brought his eyes back to the old man."What?""They need a hero.A prophet," the old man said."I may not believe in demons, but I believe in the power of faith.If these people  my people  are to ever climb out of the hole in the ground they climbed into and have a chance at a happy life, they need to conquer their fears.They need to kill their demons.And for them to have the courage to do that, they need a leader."The man paused."More than a leader.A martyr.""That's crazy," Nova said."It's the only way.""No!"Nova exclaimed."You can just tell them we're not Gods!Or demons, whatever!Just tell them the truth.Tell them the story behind the myth, and how we're people just like you.""Do you think Jesus was more than a man?"the old man asked, simply."Do you think he really walked on water?Cured the blind?"Nova didn't answer."And yet I'm sure the same point was made about him back in the Old Days.But people believe what they want to believe, in the end."The man looked up and his eyes flashed with a look eerily close to madness."Until they find something more appealing to believe."Michael shook his head."You're crazy.""They saw me walking you out.If I die and you leave, they'll think I died facing you, and I'll be their prophet.They will no more look up at *you* in fear, but at *me* in admiration.They'll have a new God  one that symbolizes fight and hope, not despair and abandonment.And then, finally they'll be free again."Michael turned back to scan the desert.He looked around, trying to spot anything resembling his ship, but found nothing.He turned back to the old man."That's all very well, sir, but the truth is, you can just tell me where my ship is now, because I'm not going to kill you anyway.""You already have," the man said.He pulled open his robe, and the silk slid down from his body to the floor like water.On his left hand, he was holding the .45 pistol.Michael took one look at it and felt the air leaving his chest."Wait," he said, his voice automatically switching to a careful and gentle tone, the way he had been trained to do when dealing with potential suicide victims."Don't do it.""Your ship is five miles east," the man said.A distant clip-clopping of footsteps echoed from the darkness of the tunnel towards them, growing louder."You have to go now," the man said."If they find you, they'll lock you again."The man didn't hesitate a second.Before Michael or Nova could react, he lifted the gun to his heart, closed his eyes and fired.The footsteps grew louder and more rapid.Michael and Nova exchanged looks.&nbsp;

Earth distanced itself slowly out the window.The Americas were making a turn into darkness, almost disappearing in the horizon, as Michael brought the tea mug to Nova, who sat by the window, her body wrapped around a blanket."Sorry, all I got is instant," Michael said."But then again, better than protein soup, right?"Nova didn't answer.Michael pulled a seat and got comfortable next to her."Sorry," he said."They teach you to make jokes and lighten the mood when dealing with victims in potential shock.""I'm not a victim," Nova said calmly."Not any more than you are, at least.""Oh, I'm making the jokes for my own sake," Michael said."I just spent a week as a prisoner of the ant people on a dead planet.I'm in shock, all right."Nova managed a quick chuckle, eyes still on the blue planet out the window.After a moment, she turned to Michael."Do you think it'll work?""What will?""That man's plan," she said."Do you think he'll become a martyr and they will you know, lose their fear?Start evolving?""Maybe," Michael said."Maybe not."He took a deep breath and puffed his cheeks."In my experience, Gods rarely ever come without side effects.My best guess is they'll soon find a reason to fear their new prophet.Or to kill each other in his name.Whatever."Nova nodded."It's weird, right?How much mental gymnastics we do to believe in the unbelievable.To believe there's something  doesn't matter if good or bad  beyond ourselves, just so we don't have to entertain the possibility that we're alone."Michael leaned back on his chair.He tried to think of something else to say, but couldn't come up with anything.Nova turned back to face the ever-distancing pale blue dot out the window.Michael turned too.They sat in silence like that for a long time.Then, when Michael was just about to fall asleep, he saw something.It was much too far to be sure, but he thought he saw a dim light flashing just where Arizona used to be.It could be the first light of a new city, he thought.The dawn of a civilization finally free from the shackles it imposed on itself for so long.Ready to fly with its own wings and following its own North.Ready to let go of fear and head onto brighter days.Then again, it could also be a shooting star breaking atmo._____________

At the edge of Penguin City, the pavement ended abruptly a few inches from June and Greg's feet, replaced by a dirt path that snaked its way between hills of every size ahead, disappearing all the way past the horizon fronting the Pink Floyd sky ahead."So this is the North road" Greg said.June grunted."You don't need to say 'this is the North road,' Greg.I know it's the North road, and you know it's the North road, and there's nobody else with us, Greg.Jesus, you're dense."June stepped forward without waiting or looking back.&nbsp;

Like the penguin had said, the path was beautiful.Beyond the road on both sides, the landscape would switch between wide fields of green and yellow; village-like houses fronted by white fences and small patches of Disney-looking woods.Looking around, June thought that she could definitely make some money selling pictures of the place to whoever was in charge of choosing the next Windows wallpaper image.She didn't have a camera with her.though."You think that penguin was telling the truth about dragons and murdering squirrels?"Greg asked, catching up after they passed a particularly nice looking wooden house by a pond."You know, when he said that the road leading to Vladmir Penguin was nice expect for dragons and murdering "

"Greg, I know what he said.Why do you keep telling me about stuff you know I know about?""I don't know" Greg scratched his head."Sorry.""Jesus, is it a requirement that your shoe size be bigger than you IQ to join the football team?"Greg threw June a sad look.They walked in silence for a while."Why do you have to be mean?"Greg asked, all of a sudden."What?""I don't mean just to me.To everyone.Why do you have to be like that?""I'm not mean, You guys in the football team and the cheerleading team are the ones who make everyone feel like shit all the time.I'm just "

"Yeah, sure, we'll prank people now and then, and we don't invite everyone to our parties.But that's just like how life works."Greg was using a serious tone of voice that June had rarely heard him, or anyone their age, using."People have 'little groups' in life, it's not just high school.Nobody likes to hang out with everybody, so we pick teams.That's just society.But you you  do your own thing and you shit on people's hearts for existing near you.Why don't you ever let anybody in?""I don't do that!""You told Sam Wilbard you'd rather kill your own family dog, sharpen it with a knife to the shape of a spear and impale yourself to death with your dead dog's carcass than go out with him.""Sam Wilbard?""He plays defense for the football team.Big blonde guy.""Oh" June remembered the guy.And the thing she had said."So?He's a jock like you.He's got women falling all around him.I'm sure he handled it fine.""He was really depressed, he even thought about changing schools," Greg said, quietly."He really cared for you and you treated him like a punchline."June glanced at Greg, then quickly down at the floor.The path was growing narrower, and more and more the beautiful farm houses and small roadside villages were being replaced by thick woodland and barren fields around them.Afternoon was falling hard and gray."I'm just saying, you know.You barely knew me after this whole Multiverse thing, and you still feel the right to talk to me like I'm a child, or an idiot.You don't treat people like people, you treat them like targets.""I'm sorry," June said, quietly."I know I suck sometimes.""You have to realize people around you have feelings too.""I know.It's just that I've known about the Multiverse for so long, Greg it's hard to keep an open heart and a positive mentality when you look around and you know exactly how insignificant and totally not-special you and everyone else is.We know there's infinite Junes and infinite Gregs, so why should we matter?"June sighed."Growing up like that I guess I learned to keep people away.I guess I thought that if I pretended that *I* didn't find anything and anyone special, maybe I'd have the upper hand on the Universe for thinking the same way"

Without realizing it, they had stopped, and were now standing in front of one another in the middle of the path.Greg took a step closer.Somewhere behind June, a bird chirped.Greg pulled a flock of June's hair from her eyes."I know how you feel."He leaned closer.She could feel his breath.He whispered, his lips almost touching hers: "It's like we're on this quest because we have to find out why people are getting sick back in our reality.Because, as you know it, of course, if people are sick in our reality it means that 
they are dying in another one.So we are using my mom's helmets to travel through all this different realities in order to figure this whole mess out.And that, in a weird way, led two people as different as ourselves to bond in such a beautiful way.I feel like "

"Holy shit!"June pushed Greg away."What?What?""Look, Greg!Behind you!"Greg turned to see what June had already seen.The wooden sign by the edge of the path, so discrete it almost merged with the trees around it, read **'North Road  Beware of Bad Exposition Gas Plants.'**

"What is that?"Behind the sign, bloated-looking purple and red plants emitted a very faint yellow gas that, now that June noticed, seemed to be permeating the whole path."The plants, Greg!They're toxic!""What do you mean?""I mean they make us talk in poor exposition-like dialogue!Didn't you notice?"June stepped closer to him."From the start, when you said 'so this is the North road' when you knew that I knew what road this was.You weren't being stupid, you were just reacting to the chemicals!""I don't get it.What do the chemicals do?""They make us talk in an unnatural, clumsy way for the sole purpose of explaining the plot of our lives to some hypothetical reader!Like when someone tells you something you already know and then uses the expression 'You know that, already, of course'.No one talks like that!""Holy shit!""That's why we were having that sentimental moment before!Don't you see?You talking about your friend and how I let him down was just a clumsy way to sneak in some backstory and develop my character as a pseudo-emotionally-complex high school antihero, or some shit like that.Well, it would be, if this was a story, of course.""So that wasn't real?The moment we had?""We're just high on hypothetical bad writing, Greg!'June grabbed Greg's hand."Even now!See how I'm over explaining all this to you?I mean, you're stupid, but not *that* stupid.You got it already.Yet I still feel the need to keep talking like an idiot."June turned from Greg to the road ahead.The sky was growing darker, and she could barely see the prism above.Night was falling."We need to get out of here as fast as we can.""Why?"June turned back to Greg.She narrowed her eyes and cupped his hand with hers."The longer we stay here, the worse it's gonna get, Greg.The more we'll talk in unnatural ways just to expose plot and characterization.It'll be hell before long.We'll go insane in no time."Greg frowned.He ran his hand through his hair, thoughtful.Worried."Greg, if we stay here long enough I'm afraid we might end up sounding like Maze Runner characters."Greg's hand went to his mouth.He couldn't hold back a gasp.________________

"Uber Customer Service, how may I "

"Yeah, hi.Hi, this is Delilah Winters."Delilah could *hear* the over-professional smile on the attendant."Hello.And what can I do for you today, Miss Winters?""I'd like to lodge a complaint about one of your drivers.""Sorry to hear that.Which one?""Ryan Gosling.From Los Angeles.""Okay I see here that you had a ride with him just last  I'm sorry, did you just say 
Ryan Gosling?""Yeah, that's right.Ryan *freaking* Gosling.""Oh.He was are you sure" Delilah heard typing."Oh, my.That's right, Ryan Gosling 
would  you look at that.""Yeah, 'would you look at that'," Delilah said, in a mocking voice."He's doing research for 
a character, apparently.""Oh.That's fun.Good for him.And what was the problem with the ride?""Well, nothing.The ride was fine.The problem was Mr. Gosling himself, sort of.""Oh.I'm sorry to hear that."Delilah could hear the smile hesitating."And what was the 
problem with Mr.Gosling?""What do you mean what was the problem with Mr.Gosling!?"Delilah scoffed."He's Ryan 
Gosling, isn't he?""Huh yes, he is.Was there a problem with the way he treated you, Miss Winters?""No, there was no *problem with the way he treated me*.He was a perfect gentlemen.He's Canadian, for fuck's sake, he was nicer than most grandmas.""Then what's the problem?""Well... it's God-damned Ryan Gosling, isn't it?You know I was calling from a nightclub, pumped full of fireball shots and PBRs?I had just puked all over the lady's room.""I'm still not seeing the problem, ma'am.""The problem is that that's some fucked up shit to pull on a drunken girl on a Thursday 
night!""Ma'am, was there anything about Mr. Gosling's behavior that "

"When I call a ride at three thirty in the morning I expect a fat, drunken, unshaved 
divorced man in his sixties who's at least as drunk as I am.Dont send me Ryan freaking 
Gosling when I'm in that situation  do you have any idea how embarrassing that was for 
me?""I'm afraid we can't control who "

"I was drunk!My tights were ripped.My hair was all over the place.My makeup was 
nonexistent.*And* I smelled like puke and poop.""Poop?""I may have ate some questionable oysters before the club."The woman sighed on the other side of the line."Well, I'm very sorry, Miss.Winters.I'm 
sure it was not as bad as you "

"I cried.""Oh.""That's right.I got in the car, he took off, I looked at him and said 'Ryan Gosling!?'and he 
smiled and I started crying."The woman didn't say anything."And then I sang 'City of Stars' from La La Land and asked him to sing with me."" did he?""HE DID, BECAUSE HE'S A DREAMY MOTHERFUCKER."The woman audibly sighed on the other side of the line."I asked him to marry me seventeen times on the ride home," Delilah said, in a mortified 
tone."I also took one hundred and thirty two selfies with him.That's one hundred and 
thirty two.One three two.I counted them this morning.He smiled in *all* of them.""Oh, wow.""Apparently I had a long conversation with his mother too, because there's a twelve 
minute call to a strange number on my phone that, when I called this morning, was answered by a male voice going 'Gosling residence?Oh, Miss Winters, hi!Ryan's mother would like to speak to you again about the ostrich situation.""Wh-what's the ostrich situation?""I don't know!I hanged up, didn't I?The fuck do I wanna know what I discussed about 
ostriches with Ryan Gosling's mother in a drunken stupor!?"There was silence on the other end of the line.Then the woman said, "I'm sorry you had 
an unpleasant experience with Uber, Miss Winters.""Yeah, no shit.""Would you like me to report your complain to the drive  to huh Ryan Gosling?""No no, it's fine."Delilah pulled herself together."Just don't send me any freaking sex 
symbols to pick me up after eleven, okay?""We'll make sure not to, Miss Winters.""Thanks."Delilah hung up and threw herself back in bed, eyes on the ceiling.*God, what an 
embarrassment*

Back at the Uber call center, Amanda hung up and puffed her cheeks.Every day was a 
surprise, in that new job.She chuckled and leaned back on her chair, and the phone rang again."Uber Customer Service, how may I help you?""Hi.Hello.Yeah, this is Ryan Gosling," the voice blurted, angry."What the fuck are all these ostriches doing in my mother's house!?"
