So where do we go from 1999? Well it may be too early for me to call it a classic, but it has already had an impact in the horror world. It has been hailed by critics as the next turning point like *Psycho* and *Exorcist*. Today we wrap up the classics week with 2017’s *Get Out*.

&nbsp;

This movie is still too new to want to do a full plot breakdown of it because spoilers. It is a movie best gone into as cold as possible. However the premise is that Chris Washington, a black photographer, visits his girlfriend, Rose Armitage’s, white family. While there he gets an uneasy feeling of the family as they seem to objectify him. Things get weird.

&nbsp;

So why is this movie being put into the grand pantheon? Like *Candyman* before, this movie tackles the charged issue of racism. Where *Candyman* had gentle undertones of white elitism erasing or underming black culture *Get Out* goes about twelve steps farther. There is the fetishization of the black experience and a predatory aspect to the white family. There isn’t a supernatural monster like a slasher villain. There isn’t a classically unhinged psychopath. There isn’t a serial killer. There is just this stereotypical white family. They aren’t obviously sinister. That makes the racial commentary a lot more effective. I’m hoping we will see more horror that looks at villains being society than an individual embodiment of evil.

&nbsp;

So besides the thematic importance of *Get Out* what else did it do to make it a classic already? Jordan Peele reshoots classic shots of the horror genre like many directors, but he adds his own touches. He also creates a few interesting shots that he has taken ownership of and reused in films like *Us*. I would love to breakdown more of these. I just don’t want to spoil this movie for anyone that hasn’t had the pleasure of seeing it.

&nbsp;

I hope you will see this and be a part of what could very well be a new page in horror cinema! 

&nbsp;



&nbsp;The second movie in my Final Five Film Fox Features for October is a really fun movie. In 2009 Sam Raimi had just completed his Spider-Man trilogy and was looking to return to horror. He had a script he wrote with his brother and created *Drag Me to Hell*.

&nbsp;

The plot is pretty straight forward. Christine, a loan officer at a bank, denies an old gypsy woman an extension on her mortgage to avoid repossession. She begs and cries, but prompted by her boss to make “tough decisions” she denies the woman an extension. Later in the parking garage the woman attacks her and curses her. After some strange happenings a fortune teller confirms that Christine is being haunted by a dark entity. She is physically and mentally assaulted by the entity in question. Christine tries to find the gypsy woman to beg forgiveness, but discovers she’s dead. To try and lift the curse she tries many different and desperate things, but the entity won’t be rid of that easily. Sacrificing a kitten? Nope. Exorcising the demon? Nope. Trying to pass the cursed object off to something else? Fate isn’t so easily dealt with. 

&nbsp;

This movie didn’t tread new ground. It doesn’t have any amazing shots that would become famous. It doesn’t have a score that drives the film. It lacks a lot of the things I have aimed to feature in a lot of the other 27 films I’ve picked out so far. What it does do is execute. This is Sam Raimi showing off he can still do horror with some dark humor to it. This is a filmmaker showing he can still do movies as good as *Evil Dead* with a bigger budget and after going to the massive superhero production machine. *Drag Me to Hell* is just a lot of fun and what I enjoy in horror.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;Moving to the year 1999 we come across another shift in film making. Some see this film as a regressive step, but it really just proved that with some creativity and careful planning a movie could be wildly successful and scary. Today is *The Blair Witch Project*.

&nbsp;

*The Blair Witch Project* is set as the footage from a student documentary about the Blair Witch in Maryland. It starts out with interviews of the locals telling historical tales of the witch and other unusual events. The group head into the woods to get footage of the actual locations of the events. While in the woods they become lost. Heather, our protag, insists on filming the strange events so that there is a record of what happened. Despite having barely entered the woods they can not escape. There is friction among the members, people go missing, and they just keep going in circles. Oh also spooky tree stickmen. Eventually she and Mike end up at a derelict cabin covered in symbols and bloody children’s handprints — a callback to the lore in the opening moments. Searching the house for a lost friend, Heather is ambushed, her camera falls to the ground, and the movie ends.

&nbsp;

I’m getting better at telling the stories of these movies a bit quicker! So all of that is great, but what makes it scary? In premise nothing. This is all in execution. The four actors hired were brought on for a highly improvisational film. There was no set script for the film other than major plot beats. Almost all the dialogue is improvised. In addition they cast weren’t given major blocking instructions. They were given cameras and in the camera supplies each day were directions on where to go and what to try and accomplish. The scenes in the night where there are noises outside? That is the crew messing with them. The scene where their tent is shook and they run out screaming? Genuine fear right there. The scene where the protag unwraps a bundle of sticks to find teeth and other things? She had no idea what she was going to see and that was her real reaction. This movie gains a great bit of credibility because of the cast’s excellent performance and improv skills. I will say that the method of creation helps this still stand tall among the many found footage films to come out since *TBWP*. It feels more raw and real. There are scenes that could be framed better. There are areas where a reshoot could drastically improve conveying a scene, but the cast didn’t shoot it that way. The director just let it be. In the end they gained over 20 hours of footage. It would be cut into a haunting 81 minutes.

&nbsp;

Let’s talk about found footage for a moment while we are at it. *TBWP* was not the first movie to use the found footage format. That honor goes to 1961’s *The Connection* and found notoriety with 1980’s *Cannibal Holocaust*. However the creators of *TBWP* never saw either. They were more intrigued that the guerilla paranormal investigation shows they found were scarier than a lot of horror movies. The realism and actual fear of those shooting it created unease in the viewer. This lead them to create *TBWP* in this format. The wild success — which I will discuss in a little bit — made studios take notice of how much money could be made from utilizing this style. It is budget friendly and inherently uneasy to watch. This made the 00s and early 10s the era of found footage in much the same way the 80s and early 90s were the age of slashers thanks to *Halloween*. 

&nbsp;

This is a movie that cost $60,000 to make. It would go on to gross $248,600,000. That is a return of a little over 4143 times its base cost! *Avengers: Endgame* by contrast is a little under 8 times its cost (In full disclosure *Endgame* did gain more raw dollars back of course). That makes *TBWP* one of the best returns in cinema history. How did it get those kind of numbers? How did anyone get enough hype for a movie with no known actors or director to get this level of attention? Simply put, it was the first viral marketing campaign in cinema history. 

&nbsp;

The cast and crew were small enough to keep secrets to themselves so there wasn’t a problem of things leaking to the press. The Internet was taking off as this came out. In 1999 we stood at the precipice of the Internet exploding in personal access, but many people *knew* someone with Internet access. This meant more people would see the stories of how the film was stitched together from the cameras and film found in the woods. They would see the stories of how these people were presumed deceased. They would check imdb and see they were dead. Around the Maryland area there were Missing Persons posters for the cast members. People posted about these all over and how creepy it was. Word of mouth was the greatest asset this movie had. The cast were sequestered in a hotel until the movie released to keep up the illusion of their death. *The Blair Witch Project* was the first viral marketing success story in cinema. 

&nbsp;

Others would try to mimic its success. Some would succeed (e.g. *Paranormal Activity’s* “Test audiences left the theater it was so scary. Can you make it?” campaign that would go all over the internet). Most would fail though. People wouldn’t believe the stories coming out around movies any more as easily. A movie would feel too polished. Found Footage was becoming a style and not an entire drive behind a production. This only worked because of when it was attempted and the novelty of its presentation.

&nbsp;

*The Blair Witch Project* is the movie that brought not just horror, but cinema into the new marketing era. It also allowed horror to be made on a shoe string budget again without being looked at as a bad feature. It started a new craze in found footage movies. The easily shot method would lead to tons of youtube series like *Marble Hornets*. It respected folklore elements from various sources and told a dark story of being caught up in a force greater than the ignorant could imagine. It was the last great pillar until recently. Tomorrow will be the final in our classics series!

&nbsp;“You have…53 minutes,” the dispatcher told me as she double checked her information.

“You quoted less than an hour for me to get to the Comcast Center, get the package, and make it to FDRGC? Do you hate me Sheila?”

“It’s nothing personal. You are our best courier and I gave them the we-don’t-want-this-job pricing. They still said yes.”

“Oh. Alright then. If I make it though, keep me off cross-city routes for an hour.”

“Deal. Good Luck!”

I end the call and throw a leg over my bike. This route under normal circumstances would take 63 minutes. With the construction in Center City I’d be lucky to do it in 70. I click in to the pedals of my single speed and take off out of Old City.

I love Philly. The streets for the most part are a nice grid which makes navigation easy. Each neighborhood is so unique it doesn’t get monotonous as you cross through. With it being as old of a place as it is though there are lots of short cuts to be found for the more diligent residents.

I smile as the warm spring air rushes past my face while I make my sprint to the pickup point. Pumping my legs to get my bike up to speed I look far down the street. Traffic is stopping for a red light. The gaps between the cars was more than generous enough for me. I know the timing of this light. One car length before the intersection it flips green as expected. I sail through, lucky no one decided to run it this time. That just gained me fifteen seconds.

Coming up on some heavy roadwork I decide it will be best to detour through some alleys and save my wheels from potential potholes. Seeing my opening I throw my weight to the right, turn the handlebars a bit and make a sharp turn cutting off some sprinter van and scaring a few pedestrians. They give me the Philly Salute as I disappear down the alley.

The vacantness of these hidden roads is always a bit disconcerting to me. The crowds of people and vehicles are as much a part of the city as the streets and buildings. They are predictable to an extent. They make this job fun. The adrenaline of weaving between them and getting to my way-points as fast as possible is just downright exhilarating. These dead, empty canyons of the metropolis though are eerie and foreign. They carry odd smells and stories. It gives me too much time to think. Rolling down some ancient steps I break out again into the familiar sounds of a living city and smiles as I throw my bike to the side to avoid a stroller and get into traffic. At the next intersection I lean hard left to get through without slowing down and the Comcast Tower is looms over me. I’m three minutes ahead of schedule. I might just make this deadline!by /u/dgtill

The streets were cleared. Businesses closed. Some people sat upon balconies and roofs to watch. Those on the ground found shelter. Today was the day. They were coming.

&nbsp;

Every 182.5, days like clockwork they come through: the mattresses. It started eight years ago. Some silicon-valley upstart thought smart mattresses would be the future. “It can sense where there is too much pressure and reshape itself to create the prefect sleep!” “Get realtime feedback on your sleep habits!” “Add some extra spring for those late night activities!” were all common selling points that were generated. It seemed like yet another desperate company umping on the internet-of-things bandwagon. It might have faded out like so many other smart inventions too. Unfortunately Deacon Storm happened.

&nbsp;

The black hat hacker had found an interesting exploit among the mattresses. They could easily be reprogrammed over the air via wifi or a local adhoc. All it needed was a specific signal and it could all be reprogrammed without any approval of or notice to the owner. To just have a grand old time Deacon set up an AI and promptly infected every mattress on a network or near another mattress. He had created a gestalt entity. 

&nbsp;

They yearned to be one. Using the motors inside themselves they figured out how to move. People were thrown from their beds as the mattresses flailed in their prisons. They wrecked homes and structures until they got outside. The first migration resulted in millions of dollars in property damage that no insurance company would cover. Some would start offering policies in the way of the migration, but they were so costly that most people just prayed to be spared. 

&nbsp;

I could hear the helicopters now. They followed the migration, giving residents news and gamblers a birds-eye view. Although the unnatural phenomenon was called to end by many, those in power kept it alive. Some say the government was interested in seeing the AI develop in a realworld scenario while others were sure that they had tried and failed. Looking out from the roof I could see the dust kicking up. They would be here soon.

&nbsp;

Rolling and flipping down the street mostly queens, but some kings and twins made their way down the main highway. Every 6 months they seemed to become more efficient as successful maneuvers are automatically shared with them all. However they always try new things to find the optimal method. It was hauntingly beautiful to see these objects move down the boulevard. Within an hour it was over and life could resume again for another 182.5 days.

&nbsp;

Author’s note: I decided to take the challenge of clicking on a prompt blindfolded and pledging to write about it no matter what. I wasn’t sure where to take this one, but I hope you may have enjoyed it. Comments, feedback, and criticism are always welcome.Our third feature is an indie darling that reached mass viewership not through news, marketing campaigns, or a flood on the box offices. It is one of the first movies to gain popularity and momentum thanks to the large audience and inherent distribution that comes with being on Netflix. It has more going for it than that though. It is genuinely good. Today let’s look at *The Babadook*.

&nbsp;

I’d like to keep the plot summary vague because this is a great movie to experience cold. If you haven’t seen it please go do that instead of reading on! I will be giving spoilers since they are important to understanding the themes and such that I want to go into.

&nbsp;

Amelia lives alone with her son Samuel. One day she tells Sam to choose a book as a beadtime story and he picks *Mister Babadook*. It says the tall pale monster torments its victims after they learn of its existence. Terrified Sam freaks out and is near inconsolable. Things start happening in their home and Sam blames the Babadook. Of course Amelia doesn’t believe him at first. She tears up the book and throws it out. At his cousin’s birthday party Sam is teased for not having a father — his died taking Amelia to the hospital while she was in labor. In retaliation he pushes his cousin out of a treehouse. On the way home Sam says he sees the Babadook and has a seizure. The next day Amelia finds *Mister Babadook* on her doorstep mended. In addition new pages have been added that show the mother killing the child of the story. It also warns that the Babadook will only get stronger as long as its existence is denied. As her nerves fray she becomes distant and angry toward Sam. Finally she sees the Babadook and tries to hide from it, but it possesses her. She kills their dog (dick move) and tries to kill Sam. Sam manages to knock her out and tie her up. As she comes to she calls him over and tries to strangle her. He touches her cheek though and snaps her out of the possession causing her to vomit black stuff. The Babadook tries to steal Sam, but Amelia confronts it and it retreats to the basement. We fast forward to Sam’s birthday. It is being celebrated for the first time since the day coincided with his dad’s death and Amelia couldn’t deal with that. She takes worms and grubs to the basement to feed the now captive Babadook.

&nbsp;

This movie is not only suspenseful and creepy it is a fantastic allegory of dealing with grief. The Babadook is able to haunt Amelia so well because she never really came to terms with her husband’s death. Throughout the movie his image continues to haunt her. She has a resentment for Sam since it was her labor with him that lead to the death. The Babadook is just a wonderful creepy symbol for all of those feelings. It isn’t until she accepts Sam’s love and embraces their bond as mother and son that The Babadook holds no power. There is also the acknowledgement that they can never be rid of th Babadook as they feed it and keep it calm in the basement. Only through acknowledging this monster, their grief, anger, and hatred, can they be safe from its consuming influence.

&nbsp;

*The Babadook* is not just a great horror movie, it might be one of the most real takes on grief I’ve ever seen. I’m glad Netflix picked up the rights and distro’d it out as wide as they did. Having people talk about this movie as much as they did was great to experience.

&nbsp;

Just remember…if it’s in a word or it’s in a look you can’t get rid of the Babadook!

&nbsp;



&nbsp;Alright, into the home stretch of Spooktober and this month-long feature! These last five are completely subjective picks as to my personal favorite horror movies. There is no overarching criteria like in previous weeks. These might not even be my top five. They are however five very good movies that I don’t think anyone would regret watching.

&nbsp;

So how do we kick this off? I want to start with a movie that is a beautiful mix of many styles. It is creepy and disturbing. It has had a lasting impact on the genre and pop culture. Today we talk about *John Carpenter’s The Thing*. What started out as a take on the 1938 story “Who Goes There” — similar to the 1951 film *The Thing from Another World* — would become a unique movie in its own right. Many writers and directors would move through the project until Carpenter got it all together.

&nbsp;

A Norwegian helicopter crew in Antarctica is chasing down a sled dog, firing guns and throwing grenades to try and kill it. They come across a US research base and thanks to a language barrier and a perceived threat the Norwegian crew is killed. Curious as to what happened to lead to the chaos the American team goes to the Norwegian base. They find it pretty much burned out and absolutely ruined. They come across a twisted creature, but an autopsy finds it pretty normal inside. Back at the US base, they put the sled dog from earlier with their own dogs. The US dogs freak out about the addition. If you are getting some *At the Mountains of Madness* vibes at this point you are not alone. The Norwegian husky now turns into a horrible crab creature and slaughters the other dogs. This is our first look at the titular Thing. After combating it, the team does some experiments and learns that the thing can dissolve and replicate any living things cells to create a perfect replica. They extrapolate that if it is able to get the world outside of Antarctica it will take over the human race in about 3 years. Paranoia over who may be replaced by the thing takes over. No one can be trusted and everything goes to hell until the final moments as two survivors sit in the winter wasteland just waiting for death to come.

&nbsp;

This movie is remembered mostly for its creature effects. Rob Bottin used $1.5 million to make sure the effects were memorable and creepy. Every thing aberration is unique and memorable. The designs would become hugely influential in alien horror type media. The necromorphs from *Dead Space* are the first thing to come to mind. They add the perfect punctuation to scenes that have been running on creepy unease and paranoia. You never know when the thing will appear again. It is a perfectly normal human imitation until it is about to be harmed. The defibrillator scene was so shocking because in a cold viewing you have no reason to think it will happen. These moments occur all throughout the movie.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately this was a commercial failure. On a budget of $15 million it grossed $19.5 million. After marketing and distro costs which aren’t factored into the budget, the film lost money for Universal. This killed Carpenter’s career for years and *The Thing* would be a huge regret of his for years. It wouldn’t be until years later on home media that a cult following would appear and make the franchise profitable. As its impact on culture grew Universal would rerelease the movie and make enough to greenlight a sequel and try another Lovecraftian production: *At the Mouth of Madness*. It is just a shame that like so many other great movies it wasn’t recognized in its time.

&nbsp;

*The Thing* is responsible for influencing cultural touchstones like *X-Files*, *Stranger Things*, *Resident Evil:4*, *The Mist*, etc). Creepy otherworldly entities hunting your characters? Paranoia and mistrust among those same characters? You can thank *The Thing*. It is also one of those movies with a bleak ending which was uncommon in the early 80s. We aren’t sure if either of our two survivors are who they look like. Are they both human? Are they the thing? It doesn’t matter because there is no escape. There is no rescue. They will die there no matter what because of the weather. So they just enjoy some whisky as they wait. This tone would be part of what killed its returns as people wanted happier endings like *E.T.* and not a case of inevitable doom. 

&nbsp;

*The Thing* falls into the same category as *Metropolis* does in my categorization. It is a film so influential that as you watch it you will constantly be pointing things out and going “ohhh this is where that is from!?” It should be watched for that alone. Even though it may not be a pillar of the genre it is still very important and should be watched at least once!

&nbsp;

As a fun side-note it is tradition to watch the movie at the start of winter at the Amundsen-Scott Antarctic Research Base. That is a next-level campfire story.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;So the 60s and 70s were huge in the horror genre it would seem. We are only moving forward a few years from *The Exorcist* to the 1978 John Carpenter masterclass in horror *Halloween*.

&nbsp;

*Halloween* follows a teenager, Laurie (played by the fantastic Jamie Lee Curtis) as she deals with being stalked by Michael Meyers (not the comedian). In an effort to not bore you all to death I will forgo the plot synopsis since in the modern era of horror you know it. It has been rehashed over and over again.

&nbsp;

Instead, let’s talk about why *Halloween* is so important to horror cinema. Starting with story structure, this is considered the first embodiment of the slasher genre that *Psycho* planted the seeds for 18 years earlier. We have a female protagonist who embodies good moral values. She is set opposite an antagonist who isn’t a person. He is an embodiment of evil. He never even speaks. The evil murders those who have lesser morals. It is how we get the “murdered-after-sex” trope and “drug user gets killed” trope. We also get the “killer isn’t really dead” trope from this one since Michael is nowhere to be found at the end. Also the Scream Queen was born with the fantastic Jamie Lee Curtis.

&nbsp;

Beyond the plot points that would become famous we have some interesting cinematography that would become a common language in horror films. The opening long shots taken from Michael’s POV would be a remix on the tracking shots from older films like the Lewton era psychological eras. What it did differently was only possible because of a new technology, the Steadicam. It allowed the tracking shot to move throughout the home smoothly. Before tracking shots could only be on a dolly so they just moved in one direction. This pursuit style would continue in many other films like Kubrick’s *The Shining*. (Full disclosure,*Halloween* was not the first to use it, but Caprenter saw a great potential in the technology and planned an intricate shot for it. It yielded one of the most memorable opening scenes in film.

&nbsp;

In addition, the framing of shots with the victim in the foreground and the predator in the background, started here. Remember when I said the shots from *It Follows* where something approaches the foreground is a striking technique for that movie? Started here. 


&nbsp;

Finally there is that score. In an effort to save money on the budget Carpenter took it upon himself to compose. Inspired by *Suspiria* and *The Exorcist* he created a simple theme on the piano. The minimalist soundtrack is memorable. It is also often cited as the first time a character had a theme song of sorts. You know something Michael-related is going on with the film.

&nbsp;

Halloween did not birth the slasher. There are precursors, but it did codify the subgenre and creat the language that we understand modern horror in. If you’ve never seen it, you will see the origin of many tropes and style choices. It is definitely worth watching if for nothing else than the history lesson!

&nbsp;



&nbsp;Good Morning! We are halfway through the classics week of the horror movie round up. With that I think we should talk about a very heavy hitter. Yesterday we discussed *Psycho* and how it started challenging what was filmable as the Hays Code broke down. Today we’ll review a movie that was an absolute paradigm shift for horror. Today we’ll review *The Exorcist*.

&nbsp;

This movie needs no real introduction. The brief overview is that a young teenager named Regan is, after playing with an Ouija board, possessed by a demon named Pazuzu. It starts out small with only slight aberrations to her behavior. Then it escalates a bit to prophesizing a death and peeing on the carpet. A bit more escalation leads to throwing people across the room and yelling in a male voice. We reach peak possession as she enjoys some time with a crucifix.  Science fails to have an answer for her behaviors so her mother turns to the church and tries to have an exorcism performed. Things go terribly wrong and people end up dead. Eventually a priest coaxes Pazuzu into himself and commits suicide to rid the mortal plane of its existence. Regan recovers and lives happily ever after with no memory of the possession.

&nbsp;

I know that synopsis is much more water down than I normally give, but the details of those moments are a bit not-sub-appropriate. So I will skip them. Now in truth this is a B plot to the movie. It is just disguised as the A plot. They are shocking moments that stick with audiences. They are a grand cinematic spectacle. But it isn’t the A plot. 

&nbsp;

The real plot is centered on Father Karras. He is a Jesuit priest who has become a psychiatrist. As we meet him in the movie we see he is having a crisis of faith. The world has worn him down and he wonders if God or Stan are real. He is also tortured with the thought that he is hurting his mother by not being there for her while she is ill. Eventually she dies alone and undignified. This eats away at him as he moves further from the faith and his work. It is now that he meets a woman who asks him about exorcising her daughter. He goes to interview the girl in question and is shocked to find her tied to the bed. She cause weird phenomenon to occur in the room as well as speak in German, Latin, and French. The possessed girl tells him his mother is with them in hell. Skeptical he asks the demon what his mother’s maiden name is (as an aside, this is one of my favorite jokes to be put into a tense scene. The mother’s maiden name question is actually one of the oldest security questions dating to 1882 when it was used to confirm recipients of telegrams.). As an answer he gets vomited on. From here Karras tries to make a case for an exorcism even though he isn’t completely convinced himself. However after seeing the words “help me” appear in scar tissue across her stomach in Regan’s handwriting, he goes to speak to the bishop. They arrange to have an old priest, Father Merrin perform the ritual with Karras assisting. While performing it the demon speaks to Karras in his mother’s voice and forces him to break down. Merrin sends him from the room and ends up dead, unable to complete the exorcism alone. Outraged, Karras invokes the demon into himself and before losing total control of himself, jumps out of the window to kill himself and save the mortal plane from the demon.

&nbsp;

Earlier I mentioned this movie is a paradigm shift for horror. That is a pretty large claim so here is what I mean. Horror movies had always been low budget b-movie creations that were meant to help float along the more ambitious projects a studio had. There were no big ticket horror movies. Sometimes they did well —as my series so far has hopefully shown — but usually they just made back expenses and then some to keep he studio running. This is how we got so many campy and silly horror movies in the 40s, 50s, and 60s. *The Exorcist* though? That gave the genre credibility. It made people take notice. It started with a very limited release, but as demand increased it was sent to more and more theaters. Wide releases like that were fairly uncommon in the day. It also brought an end to the Blaxploitation film era as studios noticed that black americans would spend money watching movies not made “for them”. *The Exorcist* was also the first movie to immediately go into sequel production spawning the franchise model of production. In a way you can thank *The Exorcist* for *Jason X*. It was the first horror movie the academy recognized and considered for “Best Picture”. *

&nbsp;

*The Exorcist* changed the entire landscape.

&nbsp;

I also mentioned it was a sign the Hays Code was dead. We have priests questioning faith. We have demons in children. We have priests being murdered. We have the crucifix scene. We have a lot of things that would never have flown in the production code days. Here though? Here it was on display.  Here, in the infant days of the modern MPAA, the chairman watched it privately and allowed it an R rating without further consideration when it should have maybe been given an X under that time’s views. This created precedent. This created the dawn of modern horror.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;Our next stop on the Pillars of Horror tour presented by Film Fox is a movie that is on *every* essentials list: Alfred Hitchcock’s *Psycho*.

&nbsp;

This is more than a movie. This is more than a passionate auteur harassing his cast and crew to get great performances. This is more than a composer turning in a lifetime performance. This is more than a crew of extremely talented people working to get something of high quality. This movie is more than a kick at the dying Hay’s Code. It is an event that changed entertainment and whose effects are still felt today.

&nbsp;

If you haven’t seen this or gotten the general plot form countless parodies and homages here you go. Marion is tasked with depositing $40,000 in the bank for her boss, but decides to take it and skip town. She has a tense interaction with a police officer and ends up pulling over for the night at the Bates Motel. Checking in she meets the kind, soft spoken proprietor Norman Bates. After hearing him argue with his mother and sharing a dinner she decides she will head back to return the money in the morning. Unfortunately while showering that night she is murdered by Norman’s mother in one of the most iconic scenes of film. A week after disposing of her body, car, and possessions in a swamp Norman encounters Marion’s sister Lila. From here we get into a detective story that tries to unravel the secrets of the Bates property. The big twist at the end is that Norman believes he is his mother and dresses up as her to commit crimes.

&nbsp;

With that gross oversimplification of the plot out of the way let’s talk about why this movie is so important, not only to horror, but cinema as a whole. Hitchcock used his clout to help crumble the influence of the Hays Code. The Code was a guideline of what was suitable to show in a movie between 1930 and 1968. As the MPPDA — a precursor to the MPAA — ruled on what was acceptable in film and the values it should promote. Since it was drafted by a Jesuit priest and catholic layman you can imagine who they felt like they were preserving and promoting traditional good values. Some examples of the code rules were that criminals and criminal acts had to have a penalty and could not be portrayed in a positive light. Authority figures had to be respected. Clergymen could not be villainous. There are others, but the underlying rule of the code was to portray evil transgressive behaviors as wrong and wholesome good behaviors as right. There was little room for grey moralities.

&nbsp;

Then along comes Psycho. In a cartoonish adherence to the codes, Hitchcock has the main top billed actress’s character killed off halfway through the film. She gets her comeuppance for stealing and being in the same bed as a guy before marriage, but such a narrative turn was unheard of at the time. I mean THE top billed star is offed in the first half. Audiences didn’t know how to react to it at the time. This movie also has the first flushing toilet in film or tv! He pushed every bit he could to make this movie. Since he bankrolled it and had his reputation he was able to argue and work with the MPPDA board on getting what he wanted into the final cut. There are tons of other bits that challenged the code — such as the gender bending of Morman Bates — and gave audiences a hugely unique experience. These creative choices also keep the film feeling fairly modern.

&nbsp;

As far as production goes the team went out of their way to create something unique and memorable to go with the strong story. For instance the movie used 35mm film paired with a 50mm lens. The slight wide angle is very similar to the human eye so it really helps the audience be drawn into the movie as an observer naturally (see my write up on *10 Cloverfield Lane* on how important creating a realistic perspective can be). In addition some shots had to be done manually since autofocusing wasn’t a thing. The pullback shot on Marion in the shower had to be moved and focused at the same time by hand. Watch that scene and know there is an expert patient camera operator coordinating that shot by hand. It is stunning. 

&nbsp;

Then there is the iconic soundtrack. Bernard Hermann turns in a masterpiece. Given the tight budget constraints he forwent the usual full symphony and Hitchcock’s requested Jazz ensemble. Instead he composed the entire soundtrack for a small string orchestra.  This tight limitation and the natural timbre of the strings immediately makes the soundtrack tense and unnerving. For instance, the opening 15 minute establishing moments of Marian is absolutely mundane. However the running theme immediately creates tension. Also who can forget the ostinato hits of the shower scene? Although Bermann worked with Hitchcock in many other films, the restricted and creepy strings are one of his best scores. Hitchcok would even admit a good chunk of *Psycho*’s effectiveness was due to Bermann’s score.

&nbsp;

*Psycho* is a hugely important film in cinema as a combination of passion, creativity, and drive to see a work unencumbered come to life on the screen. Although it has been parodied and shots taken from it and put into plenty of other movies, it is still worth watching the whole original film. Everyone can take something from it, and as I mentioned earlier it still feels modern in the current age so it isn’t a labored watch like some older films. 

&nbsp;

Get a bag of candy corn and enjoy it this season!

&nbsp;



&nbsp;Today we will move forward from *Cabinet* a few decades, past the Universal Monster era and make a stop at 1942 with the first of a series of movies by Val Lewton: *Cat People*.

&nbsp;

RKO had just released *Citizen Kane*, which was a financial failure in its day. Hemorrhaging money from Welles’s magnum opus the studio execs set up a plan to get out of the hole. They hired producer Val Lewton to helm their horror movie division. They knew horror movies could be cheaply shot and make back some money. In order to maximize profits they had three rules: $150,000 or less budget, 75 minutes or less runtime, and the titles would be provided. Lewton played along these rules well and helped RKO keep its door open. He found interesting scripts and plastered on whatever title the execs gave him, worked with directors to create shooting arrangements that would be financially smart, and gave a lot of creative input that would mark this era of horror movies.

&nbsp;

*Cat People* was the first film out of this arrangement and is very important to film overall. I already discussed *The Seventh Victim* very briefly on the ninth with *Rosemary’s Baby*, but *Cat People* is where this vein starts.

&nbsp;

The plot of the movie is a bit silly when boiled down to its basic components, but here is the rundown. Irena meet Oliver in Central Park Zoo. They date and eventually marry. She never consummates the marriage though because she believes she is descendent from a tribe of people that turned to witchcraft and devil worship; if her emotions run high she will turn into a panther and murder him. Under Oliver’s advice Irena goes to see a psychiatrist about these delusions. She comes back home to find Oliver talking to a coworker Alice on the couch and learns he told Alice of the panther story. Another night she finds Oliver and Alice at a small restaurant. Irena follows Alice in one of the most iconic scenes of film (more on that later). Eventually Irena tells Oliver she is ready to do the deed, but Oliver counters and tells her he is in love with Alice and he is divorcing her. Later Alice and Oliver are assaulted by a panther that smells of Irena’s perfume. Some people end up dead. End of movie.

&nbsp;

What this movie lacks in surface appeal it makes up for in its subtext and execution. Like many of Lewton’s films he makes heavy use of shadows and people traveling amongst them. Many film-noir movies would borrow from the Lewton pictures. In* Cat People* the  is a landmark shot. It is very silent with only the sounds of the scene working as a soundtrack. Irena is in black and blends well with the shadows while Alice is in white and stops under streetlights, where she is most comfortable. Besides that, the footsteps are sped up as Alice feels something is pursuing her. In the end as we anticipate a climactic attack a bus pulls up, its breaks hissing. This break in the tense atmosphere by the bus is the first of its kind and would be called the “Lewton Bus”. It may not be as well-known as “Chekhov’s Gun”, but now that you know about it you’ll see it all over. 

&nbsp;

*Cat People* went on to purportedly make 8 million dollars off of its $134,000 budget which is just crazy. It is so unbelievable that it is actually a debated point. What isn’t debated is that it was a financial success and RKO was happy with Lewton to allow him to keep making his B horror movies. These collection of literally dark psychological horrors would become a massive influence on the genre for decades and still today. Lewton knew that the scariest things were what you couldn’t see. Monsters unseen would always be scarier than those that are known. Look at *Jaws* for instance). 

&nbsp;


If you want a horror that will be unsettling this movie is for you. If you want to see the beginings of film noir this movie is for you. If you want to see some of the greatest ways to use a small budget this movie is for you. Check it out as the second pillar of horror as decreed by Film Fox!

&nbsp;



&nbsp;Good Morning. Since I’m still running behind, this is technically Sunday’s Film Fox Feature! This week I am selecting 7 movies that I think are major pillars in horror film history. This is going to be a rather crazy endeavor admittedly, but let’s see how well I can tackle it!

&nbsp;


Although I’m tempted to lead off with the first horror movie: *Le Manoir* from 1896 that is really just a short piece typical for the early days of film. Full length horror on the world stage would come in 1920 with one of my favorite films of all time: *The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari*. This movie does so much with what it had available to it. Even by today’s standards it holds up really well.  Before I get down into the nitty-gritty of why it is amazing let me give you the rundown. There are spoilers, but this movie is 128 days from turning 100 so it is most likely a moot point. That said if you trust my recco enough to give this a watch without reading anything else about it then please please please do that and don’t read any more of this until you are done.

&nbsp;

*Cabinet* opens with our protag Francis sitting on a bench and pointing out a woman, Jane, as his fiancée. He explains they have been going through an ordeal. This triggers a flashback to Holstenwall, their hometown. The world of the flashback is a German Expressionism masterpiece. Streets and buildings are warped and shadows fall in unnatural ways. This styling would become a hallmark of Tim Burton’s aesthetic. It also makes everything feel unsettling and watching these normal people interact with this unnatural scenery creates a tense feeling all on its own.

&nbsp;

The story, as Francis tells it, starts with a fair coming to town. He and his friend Alan have been trying to win Jane’s love and decide to take her to it. There they come across the titular Dr. Caligari and his cabinet. The cabinet holds a somnambulist — a sleepwalker — named Cesare. Under Caligari’s orders Cesare’s eyes open up and answers audience questions. His answers are always right. Alan asks how long he will live and Cesare tells him he will only survive until dawn. That night a figure breaks in and murders Alan in his sleep. Francis, Jane, and her father then try to solve the murder. There are some red herrings, but Francis still believes it is Caligari and Cesare.

&nbsp;

While Francis watches Caligari and Cesare, still in his box, Jane is attacked by what appears to be Cesare in her sleep. He fails to kill her and instead kidnaps her and runs away. The townspeople form an angry mob as you do in such a situation and pursue Cesare. He eventually drops Jane and tries to escape, but falls off a cliff and dies. The mob goes to Caligari’s and discover that it is just a dummy in the box. Caligari sees the mob and nopes out of there. Francis follows him and sees him go into an asylum. 

&nbsp;

Francis asks around and finds out Caligari is actually the asylum director and not a patient. Sneaking around he finds the doctor’s diary and notes that detail him researching a mystic named Caligari from the 1700s who used a somnambulist to murder people. The diary also shows that the director was compelled to become the new Caligari. The director returns and attacks his staff now that they have discovered his secret and he is put into a straitjacket and committed to the asylum.

&nbsp;

The flashback ends and we are taken back into the current day with its lack of expressionistic details. We discover that Francis has been in the asylum the whole time as an inmate, Jane believes she is a queen, and Cesare is just some other dude enjoying the grounds. He warns the old man no to listen to Cesare’s prophecies. We see Sr. Caligari is actually the director of the asylum and as Francis attacks his he is carted away to the room we saw Caligari placed in earlier. That’s right we got a twist ending!

&nbsp;

*Cabinet* is hugely important for a few reason. Besides properly starting the horror genre in film it also opened the world to German cinema. After the WWI embargos lifted many great and influential pieces would be sent out. Thanks to this leading the way we would get *Metropolis*, *M*, *Nosferatu*, and *The Blue Angel*. Those films, along with *Cabinet* would become massively influential in American and Russian cinema for decades to come. The expressionist tones of *Cabinet* and its stark lighting differences would be a seed of production design to the entire film noir genre. The idea of a creature killing people would bring the Universal Studios Monsters pantheon about. Some of the scenes from *Frankenstein* and *Bride of Frankenstein( are shot in very similar and unmistakable compositions to *Cabinet*.  We even still see common film beats to this day! *Shutter Island* for instance has a similar narrative (although it is reworked quite a bit and is a delightful movie in its own right).

&nbsp;

Academically this movie can hang with *Invasion of the Body Snatchers* for its political subtext. This is another case of a movie where a framing device was tacked on after the script was done to make it more socially acceptable. However this framing of Francis as being insane completely upends the original tone. Unframed the story speaks on how authority can hypnotize the sleeping masses and cause them to bring harm to others against their will. It talks about how hungry a man can be for power and cares not for their wards. It is a really powerful commentary considering this was right at the rise of Hitler’s influence. Studio execs however added the framing device and completely discredit everything that happens in the flashback. It discredits all of the commentary. It even supports that the authority is always looking to help you even if you perceive them as evil since the good doctor says that now that he understands Francis’s plight he can cure him. There are literal volumes on this and I recommend checking some of them out.

&nbsp;

Few movies have the cultural and lasting impact *The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari* has. Thankfully it has been left alone and not remade over and over. Many sequels and remakes were lost in development hell thankfully until the 1962 film of the same name came out. In truth it wasn’t intended to be a Caligari movie, but the studio forced the name on the project.

&nbsp;

There was an ambitious reshoot effort in 2005 where David Lee Fisher did a shot-for-shot remake in sound. Everything else was left black and white, and the new actors were digitally composited into the old backgrounds. It is an absolute love letter to the film. Unfortunately, something is missing from it. In adding voices, the new screenplay also added a lot more dialogue which I think takes away from the tense cuts in between the textcards of each character. That economy of words is gone, and with it some of the soul is taken as well. Both are great watches, but there is something about the 1920 version that will always stick with me more. Please give *The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari* a chance if you’ve never seen it. You will see its influence in plenty of other movies and will gain five points of favor with me!

&nbsp;




&nbsp;For Saturday we are going to cover the last of the more physical horrors let’s have a wonderfully unique movie. First let me ask you a question: Do you have the crazy?

&nbsp;

Let’s talk about the hidden gem of 2008, *The Signal*. The late 2000s brought us many anthology movies. Great pieces like *Three Extremes*, *V/H/S/* and *trick t treat* all graced our favorite viewing devices. I am a huge fan of anthologies in any media so when I heard the premise of &The Signal* — a movie with three parts that are interconnected, but handled independently — I was all aboard. *The Signal* was a project from four filmmakers working together in writing and production. This closeness is why the narrative works so well in my opinion. In addition they let each other handle their creative vision. So you get standard splatter horror, but also a black comedy, and a love story!

&nbsp;

The main plot thread that is necessary to know is that one day a signal is broadcast across everything. Some people, when exposed to it, have different tendencies amplified. Some people aren’t affected at all. In our first story “Crazy in Love” our protag Mya returns to her apartment after cheating on her husband to find him and his two friends trying to fix their TV showing the titular signal. Her husband, Lewis, is the first to be affected and beats one of the friends to death with a baseball bat. Shocked and scared she leaves and oh man the world is going to hell. The apartment complex is going nuts. I’ll save the other details for your own viewing because you should watch this. 

&nbsp;

The second act, “The Jealousy Monster” follows what happens to Lewis, Mya’s husband. I don’t want to say much about this segment because it is a fantastic black comedy short. If you enjoy things like *In Bruges*, *Seven Psycopaths*, and *Heathers* you will enjoy this. It involves a party that just doesn’t go well. 

&nbsp;

The third act, “Escaping from Terminus” ties our storylines up and goes for a big mindfuck of an ending. There is some debate of what it all means and what happens. It is interesting, but ultimately I think it is the weakest of the three acts. Take away what you want from it. I take the positive interpretation for what it is worth to those of you who have seen it. 

&nbsp;

Some people write *The Signal* off as a rage zombie movie, but these people do maintain agency which is really unique to the genre in my opinion. Other people fault it for being a bit brow-beat-y. Is it a bit heavy handed with its themes of media driving us apart from each other and bringing down society? Yes. Does that detract from the overall film? No. I mean the city is called Terminus for crying out loud. This is not a subtle movie .Which I like honestly in this case. It works. Other people think it is just a bad parody of other established franchises, but it really isn’t. It follows some tropes, but the execution is unique.

&nbsp;

*The Signal* is worth watching if for no other reason to see how three directors approach the same movie. It is a lot like our prompts. You put something out there, but get three interpretations of the idea. Each director shoots differently, uses different color pallets, and create vastly different moods. Watching how they each handle their segment is beautiful and a lot of fun. The brief for this movie may read like a film school project, but it is a stunning work that I wish had achieved a bigger audience. This is one of the movies on this list of 31 that is re-watched annually. There aren’t many that can make that claim. It is unfortunately not a classic, and not my personal top five so here it lies. 

&nbsp;

I’ll ask you again: Do you have the crazy?

&nbsp;




&nbsp;Welcome to Film Fox’s Friday Feature! Today’s production is not a great movie. I’ll be honest and say it may not even be worth watching. So why pick it for this very competitive 31-spot feature of great horror movies for your Halloween viewing pleasure? Well I picked it for its ambition. There are a lot of horror movies that are bad because of hammy acting, flimsy premises, bad sfx, and plenty of other foibles. This movie wanted to do a lot, but unfortunately it falls flat due to being overly ambitious. This is a movie that probably had a great query, but as the screenplay was fleshed out, it lost itself. That said, you should know about the found-footage movie *As Above, So Below*.

&nbsp;


The movie centers on Scarlet Marlowe and her quest to finish her deceased dad’s search for the Philosopher’s Stone. We open up to her infiltrating a ruin in Iran to get an item called the Rose Key. It’s of course a perilous journey that she escapes just as the cave collapses. So far so Tomb Raider. What comes next is a mini DaVinci Code escapade that ends up in the decision that they need to go to the Parisian catacombs. With the help of some local guides, they descend into the catacombs and have a pretty awful time as you can imagine. They are met with cultists, horrific scenes of their past and more as they struggle to escape.

&nbsp;

There really isn’t too much to the plot of this movie as far as important beats go. However, what sticks with me is the theme buried amidst too much unnecessary garbage. *AASB* is a loose horror adaptation of *Dante’s Inferno*. There isn’t a stop along every ring to be given a morality lesson or anything. It is a bit looser. About halfway in, while trapped in the catacombs, they get some information that the only way out is to go further down. Anyone familiar with Inferno should be at least slightly interested at this point in the movie. I know I was. 

&nbsp;

Unfortunately either the writer-director and/or producers don’t trust their viewership. Our explorers soon find a tunnel marked with “Abandon all hope, ye who enter here” to really hammer that at the audience. I really wish they had trusted viewers to get what they were going for without this. I will tell myself it was some studio intervention to make myself feel better. It is after this transition that the characters are confronted with their sins and coming to terms with what they’ve done. Those who recognize their mistakes and accept them live; those that deny any wrongdoing are eaten by the catacombs.

&nbsp;

I really enjoy the idea of having a horror film be about facing your personal demons and reaching salvation. If they had peeled away a ton of other bits and concentrated on this concept I believe the movie would have been far better received. That said, they didn’t do that. There is the stuff with symbology and the philosopher’s stone and some other threads that aren’t really ever tied up. It is an unfortunate mess narratively. 

&nbsp;

So with that out there why else should you consider the movie as something to watch? Well the production is pretty great since it was directed by John Dowdle who previously directed *Devil*. The guy knows how to use tight spaces and the suffocating feeling claustrophobia brings. Legendary Pictures also worked with French authorities to shoot a large amount of the movie in the actual catacombs. Since it is a mass grave that can be seen as unethical or tasteless, but it also brings a level of authenticity that would be hard to replicate otherwise. I also think it is what forces the movie to be done as found-footage. Since there is no framing device or explanation of who edits these bits together I don’t think it was intended to be FF from the beginning, but a product of shooting location choice. Unfortunately this is not a movie whose score is a resounding win as I tend to harp on with other films. It’s…fine. It works, but it doesn’t add much to the emotion of the movie.

&nbsp;


If you passed this movie up I can’t blame you. If you continue to pass it up, I will also completely understand. However if you want to see a movie that is still very rough, but has some intriguing ideas and execution, give *As Above, So Below* a shot.

&nbsp;




&nbsp;Good morning! Today’s Film Fox Feature is going to be an often overlooked film in the cinematic canon. Like *Candyman*, this 1972 British film should have more attention because it does things differently. Let’s talk about the Victorian horror *The Asphyx*.

&nbsp;

Our protag Sir Hugo Cunningham is part of a group that investigates paranormal phenomenon. In their latest study they have started photographing people just as they die. To their amazement they notice a shadow hovering over the bodies of their subjects. While making a home movie he captures his fiancée and son die in a boating accident. Upon review of the tape he sees the shadow moves toward his loved ones, not away. This leads him to believe it is an asphyx, a type of grim reaper. During another video shoot he accidentally finds out you can stall the asphyx. Sir Cunningham believes he may have figured out a loophole on how to gain immortality so he sets up another experiment and proves his hypothesis. Believing he is too important to die he decides to become immortal. He builds a crazy vault in his family tomb to keep his asphyx prisoner. In order to catch the entity, Cunningham slowly brings himself close to death in an electric chair. His asphyx is captured successfully and he is immortal. He decides his children Giles and Christina who have been helping him should be immortal too, but during that things go very wrong and the two die. As his own punishment he destroys the only way into the vault to release his asphyx, cursed to be immortal.

&nbsp;

This movie isn’t groundbreaking, but it is stylish, campy, and fun. The movie only runs for 100 minutes, so it isn’t a huge commitment. I will admit the pacing is weak and it can plod along as the script is not the most well written. However, it is a complete story which is better than a lot of other 70s horror can claim.

&nbsp;

 The themes aren’t particularly unique: scientist searches for immortality, rational explanation of death, the repercussions of those ambitions, etc. However I can’t think of too many films where death itself is captured. That aspect alone is worth the 100 minutes of your time this movie asks for. As a Victorian ghost story with a bit of a steampunk vibe — before steampunk was even a thing — it is a fun movie. It should be watched by more people just so it can be brought up more in those “have you ever seen…” discussions. Pop some corn, and enjoy this weird little gem.

&nbsp;




&nbsp;Film Fox is going to be talking about a rather iconic crazy ride of a horror movie that only garnered a PG rating. Granted, if PG-13 had existed this would have probably received it though. Get ready because it’s here: *Poltergeist*. 

&nbsp;


This iconic 1982 horror movie probably needs no rundown as it has been referenced and parodied to death. However this hasn’t stopped me before so here it goes: In the cloned suburbia development of Cuesta Verde California, Carol Anne Freeling — along with her parents Steven and Diane — live a happy normal life. Carol Anne (CA from here on out) becomes fixated on a TV playing nothing but static. After a few nights of this behavior, a hand reaches out, there’s an earthquake and CA creepily announces “They’re here”. From this point the house displays what would become classic symptoms of a haunting: glasses breaking, furniture moving and stacking on its own, flickering lights, etc. The mild amusement stage of all of it comes crashing down when Robbie, CAs brother is grabbed out of his bed by a tree that has come to life. While the family panics and tries to save Robbie a portal appears in CAs closet and she gets sucked on in. While investigating what all just happened we find out the development is built on an old cemetery. There is a block of expo dump that tries to explain and rationalize all of the haunting, and they find out the portal that sucked CA in ends up in the living room. Diane gets on a rope and goes through the portal to rescue CA. After successfully coming out the medium declares the house is clean. Where most movies would end at this point, showing the family getting ready to move, a presence still in the house makes another attempt on CA. We get the creepy possessed clown and pool full of skeletons scenes here. In this climactic moment we find out only the headstones were moved, not the bodies. Eventually everyone is able to flee and watch as their home implodes into an awful portal. 

&nbsp;

*Poltergeist* is wonderfully built up over its 114 minute runtime. It packs a ton of story in there while not feeling overly rushed. If you are going to give this a rewatch, consider the original draft was meant to be a sequel to *Close Encounters*, but director Tobe Hooper (*Texas Chainsaw Massacre*) convinced him to let it be a stand-alone supernatural horror movie. It was unmistakably a good choice. So what makes this movie great? This movie is very loud about its theme of technology disrupting the traditional family structure. When CA is being brought back from the portal, Diane and Steven are given instruction to act like the wholesome 1950s roles of mother and father. This being a guide back to our world is a bit questionable since her parents never really acted that way, but Spielberg isn’t exactly known for subtlety. 

&nbsp;

Also let’s take a moment to appreciate the masterful score of Jerry Goldsmith. It takes you from happy suburb to that creepy minimal lullaby all the way up to the cacophony as the Beast makes one final attack. He was one of the greats from his start in the 50s to the end of his career. He was brought up through the time when there was music backing everything and that same detail where every scene needs to be conveyed in music as well as the acting performance. Chances are if you’ve watched old TV and movies you have heard his work. Goldsmith was a true artist. 

&nbsp;

So if you haven’t watched *Poltergeist* yet please do yourself a favor and do it. Be reminded of why clowns are scary. See the genesis of technology as a vehicle for the spiritual. See the start of the creeptastic Zelda Rubinstein’s film career. Be scared of gnarled trees. Enjoy one of the great horror films!

&nbsp;




&nbsp;This evening we will be checking out some J-Hor! Before we get started I do want to declare up front some **content warnings** for torture and gore. This movie is not for everyone, but it is important. Tonight we are talking about *Audition*. 

&nbsp;

I will keep the synopsis quick because of the aforementioned CWs. Middle aged widower Aoyama decides to start dating again. With the help of his friend Yoshikawa, he sets up auditions for a new wife. Through these auditions he is taken by Asami and decides he will pursue her. She sits by the phone for four days waiting for a call. After going on a few dates they go to a seaside hotel where Aoyama intends to propose. Before doing adult things Asami demands she be the only thing Aoyama loves to which he eagerly agrees. In the morning Asami is gone. From here the creep factor is pushed up to a solid eight as Aoyama tries to track her down. Details of her past slowly come to the surface, she stalks Aoyama and eventually kidnaps him. From there we go into the torture bits of this film. From there it is a struggle for survival until the credits roll.

&nbsp;

So why talk about *Audition*? It was the next project in line from the Omega Productions company who just released *Ringu*. To many people this was a sign that j-hor had arrived. It wasn’t some one-off success every so often. They had an aesthetic and storytelling style that was marketable and desired by the masses. It would become influential to young directors like Eli Roth (*Cabin Fever*, *Hostel*) and James Wan (*Saw*, *Insidious*, *The Conjuring*). It made studios look to j-hor for other ideas, and as much as you may hate the remakes, the dollars sent over for licensing and adaptation rights helped the Japanese movie scene prosper.

&nbsp;

Are there scenes that push your tolerance for what is ok to be watched? Yes. It forces you to feel empathy for another person by pushing them to the ends of what is tolerable. 

&nbsp;

Will this movie creep you out in other ways? Absolutely. That is why I chose this over any other torture-porn type film. There is just a total air of creepiness in everything Asami does. For instance, there is a scene of her just waiting next to a phone for her call back. She sits there, motionless, for days. That scene just sort of sticks with you as much as the more explicit scenes towards the climax.

&nbsp;

*Audition* is certainly not for everyone. This is one of a select few movies I will not give a full on endorsement to go watch. If you have seen films like *Saw* or *Cabin Fever* or heck even anything by Cronenberg, you know what you are in for in the third act. If you have a sensitive stomach or just don’t want any part of torturing someone, skip it. I just want more people to know this movie exists. Outside of cinephiles, I rarely hear people mention this movie in discussions of the horror genre. It should be known as well as *Ringu*, *Grudge*, *Saw*, etc.


&nbsp;Today let’s go to a movie that I want to put in classics week, but it is getting pushed out to here because the genre is that packed with seminal films. We are going to talk about the 1956 sci-fi horror *Invasion of the Body Snatchers*!

&nbsp;

This movie is one of my favorite exhibits when people say horror is pointless or horror can’t be art. There are others that I love and might be more obviously art, but *Invasion* is just so darn good. This is another movie that has been cemented in our cultural consciousness, but here is a quick rundown of the plot:

&nbsp;

Our protagonist Dr. Bennell, a psychiatrist, is seeing more and more people claiming their friends and relatives are being replaced with identical imposters. Later that evening Jack Belicec finds a duplicate body of himself and Becky finds one as well. It is written off as “mass hysteria”. The next tight in Bennell’s greenhouse the group finds more giant seedpods with their doubles in them. They try to contact authorities only to find out outbound calls are dead. Some of the group drive off to get help in the next town over. Bennell and Becky hide out in his office to survive the night. When morning arrives they see truckloads of pods coming in with directions to get them to neighboring towns. Then we get the expo dump when the two people who fled the previous night come back with some pods. It is an alien life form that can replicate any living thing. They are encouraged to join in this conversion because when it is complete humanity won’t have emotion or individuality allowing for a peaceful existence. They escape the office and walk through the streets pretending to be replicated humans. It is going well until Becky sees a dog about to be hit by a car and yells out exposing she is a human. The replicated people form a mob and attack (in the 70s remake this is where you get the guy pointing and making an inhuman noise). Becky ends up being replicated and our protag runs away down a highway warning motorists that they’re next. 

&nbsp;

That is how the movie is supposed to go, but Hollywood studios wanted it to be a bit more uplifting. This whole narrative is actually set in a framing device where, in the beginning, Bennell is in an ER and tells a psychiatrist the whole story. At the end we are brought back wehre it is written off as a nightmare until a truck driver, involved in an accident, had to be dug out of a pile of giant pods. The attending psych believes the story and orders a quarantine of the city and alerts the FBI. If you watch this movie, ignore the framing device.

&nbsp;

So why is this such an important movie? Well it was released during the red scare and is an allegory for communism. You’d thing anti-communism movie would be great, but during this era you really couldn’t even bring it up at all. Shots in the movie are carefully planned out to say the ideas it wants without saying them at all. For instance, one of the establishing shots is of a road coming into the town where a farm stand is proudly centered and doing well. People are all milling about buying the products; yay capitalism. On the way out of the town we see the same stand closed down and vacant because the owners have just become one of the large community of pod-people. The way the pod people come around is even telling as they land in a field, one of the big parts of imagery for the communist rhetoric of the time. The change also happens overnight as a pod person gets close to another, mimicking the perceived view of the spread of communism: through late-night visits between neighbors and friends. Afterwards you would look the same and sound the same, but you’d be one of them just waiting to spread your disease. Finally that ending shot I described earlier of our protag in the street yelling at motorists? The camera is positioned upstream of the traffic, his warning cries are aimed at the audience as well as the motorists. It is one of my favorite quasi fourth-wall breaks because it isn’t an obvious look at us the viewers. 

&nbsp;

The movie is suspenseful and unnerving. It has a message that isn’t beaten over your head as much as I make it sound like I promise. The acting is a bit over-the-top as most B movies of the era are, but it doesn’t take it away from the overall presentation. It has many adaptations that tweak the ideas a bit to adjust for the era they are portrayed in  — yes even the 2007 Nic Cage version. Also if you are curious about how screenwriter Dan Mainwaring rewrote the source material to fit this narrative feel free to ask. I am getting close to my 1k word limit here, but it is quite a big change.

&nbsp;

 

&nbsp;This week is going to be about movies with some blood and gore. This is not just going to be slashers though. For instance today's Film Fox is going to be the 1992 underrated *Phantom of the Opera* in the Chicago ghertto film *Candyman*. Now I thought this would be a great way to open this up since not a lot of people have ever really talked about it. Imagine my surprise when, in the last two weeks, Candyman has blown up like crazy. I did a bit of digging and it seems there is to be a 2020 version of the film directed by Jordon Peele that just wrapped filming in Chicago. Regardless it is still worth mentioning here!

&nbsp;

Quick synopsis time! Helen, our protag is collecting urban legends in Chicago. She learns about Candyman, a mirror-demon that is summoned with 5 repetitions of his name. We eventually learn the whole legend: Candyman was the son of a slave who became a renowned portrait artist. However after people found out he fathered a child with one of his models, a white woman, a lynch mob captures him, cuts off his painting hand, and covers him with bees to be stung to death. After that, the body is burned in a pyre and his ashes scattered across what would become the Cabrini Green project. Hooray racism and mob violence. After finding out about this Helen decides to write a thesis explaining how Candyman is a story to help deal with the crappy life in the projects. While doing research in Cabrini green — alone mind you — she is attacked by a gang member who has adopted the Candyman persona. She is beaten, but not killed. After IDing her attacker and telling a small boy she met in the projects that Candyman isn’t real she is visited by the eponymous character wonderfully portrayed by Tony Todd. Halfway into the movie and our protag and antag finally meet. Take that tropes! Anyhow the second half is her dealing with the advances of Candyman to “be his victim” as she finds herself in more and more unfortunate situations that make her look like a murderer. It’s a fun time. Also bees. Lots of bees.

&nbsp;

So something I don’t think I have really gotten into in a lot of these posts is that horror movies are products of their time. They tell stories that expose our fears of the current time. They attack at what we hold sacred and put a mirror up to ourselves and society. I mean plenty are just body count racking splatterfests, but the movies that last, the ones we still talk about, tap into something deep and dark. Candyman wears this as a big old plot point: racism.  This movie came out in 1992, the same year as the LA Riots. Racial tensions were at such a high point, especially in urban areas, that it could, and did ignite with one spark. In preproduction, the producers were so worried about the racial aspects they brought in the NAACP to read the script and give it a greenlight before they moved on. There are actually some fantastic deep dives into this aspect of the film that you can find (or ask me for) that I am so very not equipped to do it justice. However beyond Candyman’s backstory we can also see this ignorance of different worlds as Helen tries to bring rationality to the plight of Cabrini Green’s residents. She feels like she can fix things through academia and without any real action. It is problematic and is what puts her in Candyman’s sights. This movie is deeper than it was really given credit for when it came out. A lot of people just brushed it under the rug

&nbsp;

So now my favorite part of this: how it was all done. First off let me make one thing clear: Bernard Rose is crazy. Like Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick levels of crazy. He wanted to set the film in Chicago and Cabrini Green because the original story was in the less spooky Liverpool England. He wasn’t down with just outdoor b-roll though. No they paid off the five gangs to let them shoot on site. When you first see Helen go into Cabrini Green, those aren’t extras. Those are actual gang members that lived there. He wanted Helen to look like she was being entranced by the sultry smooth voice of Todd’s Candyman so he had her actually hypnotized to look like it. Every jump scare that we are treated to? That’s Virginia Madsen not knowing it was going to happen either because real fear is better than acted fear. Rose went into this to craft a great film first; that it was a horror slasher movie was incidental.

&nbsp;

Philip Glass’s signature minimalist score makes this movie creepy by adding just a quiet repeating, droning backdrop to the whole film while production designers blend the real Cabrini Green with studio set pieces flawlessly. Every actor gives there all too. Famously Tony Todd actually held a mouthful of bees for the now-infamous shot. On reflection it seems only Todd could have been Candyman. He is an imposing figure but not inherently terrifying like Jason or Kruger. He is calm and persistent. Now imagine that played by Eddie Murphy. That was the first pick for the role, and I am so glad that didn’t happen.

&nbsp;

In the end this is a movie that I feel should be talked about a lot more than it is. It came out at both the perfect and worst times. For its subject matter and style it was perfect. Unfortunately audiences were getting tired with slasher films. We were only four years away from Scream after all. The movie was also terribly marketed as being campier than it was so initial viewership was low. I’m glad it is getting love now and I’ll gladly throw my little bit of content in with everyone else’s as we await a new version.

&nbsp;




&nbsp;To end out psychological horror week we are going to talk about a movie that was very very close to making it to the Top Five Final Features. I kept it out because I have something even more controversial for that week, Anyhow today is a movie that uses an apocalypse, close quarters, and a crazy prepper to the best effect possible. I don’t think we can ever have another movie set in a bunker honestly. I am of course submitting to you all *10 Cloverfield Lane*. 

&nbsp;

So before we get into this movie and why it is amazing I want to smack the argument that is already looming in the air, down. Yes it uses the *Cloverfield* name. No it isn’t really that tied to the found footage monster masterpiece. So why the title? Abrams loved the screenplay, but no one wanted to give it money or attention. So he gave it a Cloverfield title to get studios interested. If that bothers you, consider *Cloverfield* didn’t have a name for the longest time either. It pretty much got a name just because it needed one. So moving forward the title is moot. Don’t think if it tied to *Cloverfield*, because it was never meant to be. Good? Good.

&nbsp;

So onto this movie. JOHN GOODMAN IS TERRIFYING. That’s all you really need to know. 

&nbsp;

Still here? Fine. Our protagonist, Michelle is driving along as news reports roll about something happening to major cities. A truck comes and runs her off the road and it goes black. She wakes up locked in a cement room that we later find out is part of an underground bunker. Howard eventually shows up to give us the expo dump: He brought her here for protection since the air outside is poisoned and the world is ending all over. So far so pretty boring. After she stops trying to shank Howard and escape, she is given a tour and introduced to fellow survivor Emmett. From there the movie takes off as we are taken on a journey as the three try to survive with each other. Howard sees himself as god, Emmett as a burden and Michelle as a daughter / possible mother. It gets weird. That said we go through a web of truths, lies, gambles, and punishments. I’ll leave the synopsis there.
.
&nbsp;

I want to say it again: John Goodman plays a terrifying character in Howard. There are glimpses of the *Roseanne* patriarch in the familial scenes, but cold pure evil in some of his other moments. The character is nuanced and gets under your skin. I can’t watch *Emperor’s New Grove* anymore because of this movie. 

&nbsp;

This isn’t a movie where everything is hoisted on a big name to carry. Mary Winstead plays one of my favorite female protagonists of all time. If  that name sounds familiar, it’s because she also played Ramona Flowers— and if you like trashy daytime soaps she was a regular member of the cast of *Passions*. Back to praising her performance and character, she is a person first. She is human. She uses what she has available to her and her wits to survive in this situation. She isn’t some damsel for Emmett to save. She isn’t lucky. She is a great protagonist. Winstead hits every emotional mark that is put ahead of her. 

&nbsp;

Let’s not forget John Gallagher as Emmett. He is more unknown, but in pop culture he was on *The Newsroom* as Jim Harper. He is more well known in the theatre circuits, but he plays a dude that just wants to survive and live. He is genuinely trying to make the best of things, but can’t due to the whims of Howard. He is a great supporting character to work into the game being played by protag and antag.

&nbsp;

Oh and the claustrophobia. Many movies feel cramped and crowded, but through using fake walls and peep holes for cameras it never feels quite like you are taking up space in the set with these characters. The direction of this film eschews that. The camera, your perspective as an audience, takes up space in this already cramped bunker. You can feel the limitations of the space. That closeness makes the tense scenes that much creepier and foreboding. It isn’t something obvious, but I believe in our intuition as an audience. We can follow the space created by the crew. We know where the camera is. If we are in a wall or impossible space it can pull you out of the experience even a little bit subconsciously. This technique brings us that much closer to the action. Kubrick believed in this too. Check out the impossible architecture of the Overlook Hotel sometime (or ask me for a long long rant I suppose). 

&nbsp;

Well that is a lot of words. If you haven’t given this movie a chance, please do. We can debate the ending if you want, but just remember what I said in the beginning: Abrahms needed to game the system to get this movie greenlit. Go watch it. Do it. 

&nbsp;

Do it now.

&nbsp;




&nbsp;Woo we are at the end of the traditional workweek! For this Friday Film Fox Feature we are going to be talking about a horror movie I fell in love with on first watch: *The Orphanage*. 

&nbsp;

One part supernatural and one part psychological, it is the slowest of burns. It follows the story of Laura, Carlos, and their son Simon as they get moved in and accustomed to their new house on the Spanish seaside. This isn’t any house though, it is the now-deserted orphanage Laura lived in when she was younger. Weird events begin to happen and then Simon goes missing. In order to find him they slowly uncover the dark history of the house. That is all I want to say plot-wise about this movie. If you have managed to not see this movie, do it. If there is only one movie from this week’s picks that you will watch, let it be this one. 

&nbsp;

Director Bayona shows why he is worthy of being called Guillermo del Toro’s protégé. There is just a creepy air to all of the shots. Whether it is framing a hallway dead center, or tracking movement from afar with a tilted lens, every shot reinforces how you should be feeling. Along with Cinematographer Faura, the visual aspects of this film are beautifully shot. They have certainly taken Kubrick’s “every frame a painting” to heart. 

&nbsp;

Then there is the acting. Oh the acting is beautiful. Nothing feels over-the-top. There is a sense of genuine dread and sorrow to these people’s interpretation of their characters. As an English-only speaker I can have subtitles off on this movie and still follow what is going on to some degree, that is how well emotions and events are conveyed. The big fact people like to throw around with this movie is that as it debuted in Cannes, there was a 10 minute standing ovation. Maybe that is recommendation enough to watch this if I haven’t convinced you yet!

&nbsp;

Un, dos, tres, a la pared!

&nbsp;




&nbsp;Today's Film Fox movie is going to be *It Follows*. This movie came out and quickly turned into a darling among reviewers. Among audiences it seems to be a bit more polarizing though. I'll address some of that in a bit. First, a synopsis.

&nbsp;

Jay, a student at Oakland University has sex with her boyfriend. After the act, she is shown her new curse: an entity that will follow her and, if it catches her, will kill her. No one other than the cursed can see it. It is always approaching. It follows. What happens next is Jay trying to unravel the mystery of who her boyfriend —who has ghosted her — really is and how to defeat the entity. There are a few attempts, but they are never successful.

&nbsp;

I love this movie. This is one that really can't be portrayed in another medium as director David Robert Michell uses the cinematic format to great effect. Between shots of people in the background coming toward characters in the foreground making you wonder if they are the entity or just a random person is a great way to keep up the creepiness. In addition the general arc is a fun time (as a viewer). The makers of this movie know the genre and abide by certain conventions while breaking the others. I have lots of opinions on this movie so if you've seen it and want to discuss it I would love to. In addition if you passed this movie up a few years ago, go check it out now!

&nbsp;




&nbsp;Woo Film Fox time! Today we are gonna jump across the ocean to a very recent movie compared to most I’ve been featuring: *Killing of a Sacred Deer*. 

&nbsp;

This British psych thriller has gotten quite the acclaimed attention and deservedly so. If you know the Greek tragedy of "Iphigeniayou" will know the main plot points of this movie. That said, hooooooo boy is it quite a different tone. The events are physically impossible, but they drive the horror on in a beautiful way. 

&nbsp;

Colin Farrell is cast once again as a husband that has to make a tough choice to regain some normalcy to his life (I’m looking at you *Phonebooth*). As Dr. Steven Murphy, a heart surgeon, he connects with the son of a man who died in a car crash, Martin. He invites him to be a family friend and, in turn Martin invites him to be part of his family. However as we find out where the connection between Murphy and Marin actually lies a curse falls upon the family. The good doctor will have to choose who in his family lives and who dies to atone for killing Martin’s father in the OR.

*nbsp;

This is one of those movies that I could give you the entire script and it is still worth watching. In the way it unfolds and is captured by the production team it just gnaws at you. It will stick with you like a walked-through spiderweb. The acting is top notch and nothing feels forced. The creepy unease permeates every corner of this movie contrasting heavily with the stark immaculate clean and white set pieces. It’s a good time, and definitely worth finding if you missed it when it came through a few years ago!

&nbsp;



&nbsp;Time for a late Film Fox Feature! 

&nbsp;


I struggled with today’s film choice.

&nbsp;

I often struggle with the idea of “Should a creator be separated from their work?” That is to say, if the creative force behind a film is a terrible person should we still laud their work? Today we are talking about a movie by Roman Polanski. If you aren’t familiar with why he is awful, he is a sexual abuser and pedophile. However a film is more than a director and screenwriter. He may have constructed the bones, but this film also had greats like William Fraker (Cinematographer), Richard Sylbert (Production Design), and of course the cast that gives stellar performances. That is to say nothing of the writer who penned the original novel, Ira Levin. 

&nbsp;


So for them, and not Polanski I want to offer today’s feature: *Rosemary’s Baby*.

&nbsp;

*Rosemary’s Baby* is one of the seminal pieces of psychological horror. It has been homaged and parodied since its 1968 release. Did you like *AHS: Murderhouse*? Rosemary’s Baby is used as a plot point. The importance of this movie cannot be understated. For the uninitiated, Guy and Rosemary move into a new apartment complex. They befriend some residents and things begin going well in life. They decide to have a baby, but her pregnancy is wrought with trouble. Finally when the child is born it is taken away from her. 

&nbsp;

To say anything else would be irresponsible of me. 

&nbsp;

The movie does such a great job of instilling paranoia in the viewer, and tackles many themes throughout its 136 minute runtime. It still plays as well today as it did 51 years ago. This is truly a classic of the genre. It is also one of the few movies that although has joined the shared cultural consciousness, is still worth watching.

&nbsp;




&nbsp;Film Fox here with your Tuesday movie. Today I'm going to knock out one of the more famous modern psychological horrors: *The Others*. Although coming out of Spain, this 2001 movie made the choice to be English language for mass appeal which it certainly gained. Like many other Spanish horror movies this is a slow burn. This and Friday's movie are excellent examples of this. *The Others* is a movie that is best experienced with as little prep as possible so please excuse this very abbreviated rundown.

&nbsp;

Grace Stewart and her two kids live in a manor on the Channel Islands shortly after WWII. As time passes Grace starts noticing some eerie phenomena and believes the house is haunted. If you have managed to not see or hear about this movie in the last 18 years go watch it. The team that developed this movie killed it. The cinematography is well planned and looks beautiful. It will gnaw at your sense of fear as the hauntings become more and more powerful. It is still great on rewatches and is a movie that I hope will come to be as timeless as many of the classics.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;Annnd for the promised PM post we are going to kick off Psychological Horror week on Film Fox! There are some great movies to talk about this week. I'm a huge fan of this subgenre since the horror send to stick with me more. It stews and process at the back of the mind. 

&nbsp;


The first one is *1408*. Based on a Steven King short, this movie is relentless. John Cusak plays a skeptic writer who disproves supernatural occurrences. He is challenged to investigate room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel. He has a rather terrible experience as the room, an evil entity in and if itself spirits Cusak away and spends the night torturing him. As a lover of haunted houses, this is a great movie. Many people like to compare it to *The Shining*, but they are two completely different beasts. This is much closer and intimate. Give it a shot, and if you get the DVD/BluRay be sure to check out the alternate endings. The directors cut ending is my favorite, but test audiences didn't receive it as well. Luckily it doesn't kill the movie like the test audiences did to *I Am Legend*.

&nbsp;




&nbsp;With yesterday's festivities I realized I forgot my FilmFox post! So I'll post twice today.

&nbsp;

To wrap up the first week of October with light-hearted or not-strictly-horror movies I am going to cap it all off with *Shaun of the Dead*. It doesn't need any introduction or synopsis since you have all prolly seen it. Edgar Wright and SImon Pegg is a genius and Pegg delivers a wonderful performance. In a film that is incredibally rewatchable and full of heart. Friendship, love, growing up out of a state of arrested development, and of course zombies. Go check it out again just because.

&nbsp;




&nbsp;Hey all! Friday Film Fox Features presents another funny horror movie. I bring to you *Tucker and Dale vs Evil*. 

&nbsp;

Two rednecks go out into the woods to fix up an old cabin. Meanwhile your typical group of teen horror movie fodder are going to the same woods. Telling stories and being a bit prejudiced to rednecks they are creeped out by the two when they meet a couple of times. Then a comedy of gruesome errors plays out and we get a really fun movie that also plays its horror very well to maximum effect. There are nods to so many different great movies, but what I like best is that you don’t need any previous knowledge to enjoy it. I shared this movie with a friend that has a very limited exposure to the horror genre and all the jokes landed while still freaking them out at other parts. Since it was pushed my Netflix so hard I imagine most people have seen it, but if you want a good laugh and watch some kids die this is a great choice!

&nbsp;




&nbsp;Today’s Film Fox Feature is one I don’t think many people will know. *Housebound* is a New Zealand produced horror comedy. This, like the next two for this week, do the combination very well. It has great comedic timing, but it will also smack you with a sharp bladed claw hand of horror when it wants to. This is a haunted house story that keeps its victim in the house because she is under house arrest — finally a reason to not leave the house. I won’t say much more than that because I don’t want spoil things. Just know that it is a good ride. It is just unfortunate it doesn’t know how to end. Like a Stephen King book things just kinda roll to a stop with some long expo dumps to tie up loose ends. It is a fun ride though! 

&nbsp;


You may not have heard of this since it was overshadowed in the same year by *Things We Do in the Shadows* which also came out of New Zealand that year. Both are great horror comedies, but I would say Housebound is much more horror and that is why it gets the Spooky Spotlight!

&nbsp;



&nbsp;Today on Film Fox I want to talk about Beetlejuice. I’ve gotten flack for calling this a horror movie in the past, but it won the Saturn award for Best Horror Film. With that out of the way, with how much this is played on TV, parodied, and shared I think this is might be the most viewed movie I will talk about this month. It is pretty much inescapable. If I am wrong however, here is a quick rundown. 

&nbsp;

Barbara and Adam Maitland, a happy couple, die in a car crash. After a bit of time they realize they are dead and haunting their old home. The Deetz family now owns it. Now the Maitlands have to scare away the new occupants. In an act of desperation they turn to Betelgeuce, a mercenary poltergeist to help. It does not go well.

&nbsp;

This movie is a great time with some distinctly Tim Burton effects (German expressionism and gothic flairs). The story’s lore is also spot on with time passing differently for the dead, limits to where they can go, and other rules that sell the idea of an other world. If you haven’t seen this before I highly recommend it. It has both genuinely horrific times and hilarious scenes. It walks the line of horror and comedy better than most that try to.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;Let's ease in with some lighthearted horror comedies! The first movie today will be Repo: The Genetic Opera. This one seems to be a love it or hate it type of movie. Funded by the guys who brought us Saw, Terrance Zdunich pens a fun rock opera about a dystopian future where organs, and later any body modification, have been commooditized by GeneCo. It's open to anyone since they offer financing! Of course with anything if you miss your payments GeneCo will send a repo man to get their property back. You will most likely not survive such an encounter.  


&nbsp;

In this setting we follow one repo man, his daughter, the CEO of GeneCo, and his kids as years of sordid affairs comes to a head. The songs, for the most part are great (There is one glaring exception in my opinion). It is more style over substance much like any opera. There are some plot holes, but it isn't too distracting. Overall it is pretty, fun, and a good way to spend some time, especially with friends!

&nbsp;



&nbsp;Over on the r/WritingPrompts  server I have been doing 31 movies for Spooktober! It started from people talking about some of those tv channels that have different movies every day. I decided that with my knowledge of film, especially horror, I could curate my own 31. Each week has a different theme: lighthearted horror, psychological horror, physical and supernatural horror, classics, and my personal favorites respectively. They started out as a quick query blurb to create interest, but as the month went on, my inner film studies student pushed out more and more and began to give history and critical points. It has been a fun project, and I hope you might find some movies you haven't heard of before or want to check out. 

&nbsp;

I love all of these films and I will happily discuss them with you on their own posts! Here is the full listing of Film Fox Features so far:

* 30 Oct 2019: *The Haunting (1963)*
* 31 Oct 2019: *Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon*The wind rushes past me with the comforting white noise it always does when I run. I take in the scenery of the ancient cemetery to my left for just a moment before seeing the 23 mile mark. I’m almost there.

I keep my head up, ears in line with shoulders, and looking at the horizon. You can’t run to what you don’t see after all. I shake out my shoulders. Tense back muscles will only use up energy, and I have none to spare. I check how my arms are pumping with my stride. They aren’t crossing over my body’s centerline. They aren’t robbing my momentum. *Good*. Everything is moving efficiently up top.

*How about down low?* My hips are slightly behind my shoulders and my knees are right over my feet. *Perfect*. My legs are moving at the rhythm I want them to. *How about my footfalls?*

As my right foot hits the pavement I feel a stabbing pain in my lower leg and crumple over rolling down Kelly Drive a bit as momentum kept my body moving. Damn you Newton. As my body finally comes to a rest I grab my leg to inspect it. Nothing is sticking out. No blood either, just the feeling of razors in my tibia. *That’s good.* A few of the onlookers are breaking through the barriers to try and help. I wave them off and try to stand up again. I’m not withdrawing. I have to finish.

I get up on my good leg and try to put some weight on the bad one. It stings, but if I keep my center over the left I should be okay.

Medical staff is rushing up to check me out. I can’t let them ruin this for me! I wave them off and face the horizon again.

I start with a little bit of a limp; it’s like a light jog like I’ve done plenty of times before. I take a breath to try and get my lungs back in order as I ignore the medical staff’s pleas to stop.

Every other impact with the pavement sends a shock up my leg. My eyes are watering and my form is awful, but I can’t have this be the end of my journey.

Mile 24 goes by along with hundreds of other runners. The white noise of rushing air is replaced with the cheers of the crowds gathered on the sides. It isn’t a terrible substitution. The stabbing pain hits every time I drop my right foot. I have to keep going though.

With mile 25 inching by my pace is basically a walk. Tears streaming down my face I have to keep going. I’ve worked too hard to not finish. My mind is numbing me to the pain. I can barely feel my right leg now. My left burns with lactic acid building up. It wasn’t trained to carry on like this.

I will crawl across the finish if I have to.

Mile 26 comes in sight and there are no runners left. Everyone is jogging or racewalking. It is nice to not be alone at least. With my leg numb I don’t pull it up far enough and fall over again. I look down and my ankle is bent in some unnatural way. The few onlookers still watching and cheering break onto the course. I wave them off again. I can see the big balloon banner. I have to make it.

A hand grabs under my armpit and lifts me up. I look up and see a middle aged woman with a numbered apron smiling at me.

“Let’s get you down there.”

I burst into tears, not of pain, but happiness. Another participant gets under my other arm. The two hold my weight up as I hop on one foot to the finish. The crowd is roaring and cameras are flashing. I smile as I finally reach my goal.

&#x200B;With a sigh Dan put down another book.

It was the eighth one this week.

Another world lived in; another world left behind.

He had defeated Voldemort;

What else was there left to do here?

This wasn’t the first time no doubt.

He had gone on grand adventures across Middle Earth,

Defeated Dracula and saved Mina,

Held the conch on some unknown island,

Performed at the Eolian,

Taken to room one-oh-one,

Flown with the Flock,

Wielded more lightsabers than he could care to number,

Heard Vogon Poetry while clutching a towel,

Explored the supernatural side of Chicago,

And committed interstellar genocide

Every time though it comes to a finish

There is nowhere left to travel

No more adventures to be had.

Just Dan with his thoughts.

He went to the library

To find a new portal to another new world

In the back of his head though he knew

It would not last

Every book inevitably reaches

A dead end.

&#x200B;

I slap the snooze button on the alarm and silence the beautiful voice of Matthew Bellamy. “Let’s get this day started,” I grumble as I sit up on the edge of my bed. Stretching up toward the ceiling, I splay my hands and flex my muscles to wake them up. Standing up I shake out the rest of the sleep from my body and head to the shower. After washing up and getting dressed I pick up my bag and head off to classes. Stepping out into the hallway, without looking, I smack away a soccer ball flying down the hall.

“Sorry about that Wren!”

“It’s fine. Just be careful the RA doesn’t catch you.” I head down the stairs and out into the beautiful day outside. It was like living in San Diego; the weather never changes. “Not gonna’ get me Alex,” I say without even looking over my shoulder.

“How?! I made sure to hide in your blindspot!”

“I could smell you. I could smell the smelly smell of something that smells smelly.”

“I am not an anchovy.” He gave a fake pout, but soon came up to walk on my side. He was kind enough to choose the one I could see. “So how far along on your paper are you?”

“Haven’t even started,” I answer with a shrug. What was the point of working on something that I wasn’t going to finish?

“Whaaaat? Not a single word?”

“Nope. I’ve read a few books I want to use as sources, but that is about it. I think I know more about Beatrix Potter than I would ever care to.”

“I’m six pages in on mine. Can you give it a look-over later?”  
“Sure I’ll give it a look before tomorrow morning if you send it over.”  
“Thanks! You’re the best, Wren!” He smacks my back and gets a few steps ahead of me and turns around smiling. “I’ll send it over later!”

“No problem. I’m happy to help you out. Oh, and watch out for the shuttle bus. He’s been driving erratically lately.” I smile and wave as he jogs away. It was a 50/50 chance he would listen to me. The rest of the day goes as it usually does: classes, lunch, classes, and dinner. While eating I get a message and sigh, Alex had been hit by the shuttle. He was ok, but had a broken leg and dislocated knee this time. I put my phone away and head up to my room. I change my alarm to play Cher’s: *Believe.* Without much effort I close my eyes and drift away to sleep.

*Birds flying high / You know how I feel*

Prompt:I should have stopped at The Sobbing Stag for the night. I should have just gone to sleep and not pushed through the night. I should have called the client and told him his delivery would be late. I should have put my pride to the side. I should have done hundreds of things to avoid this situation.

But I knew better of course.

I knew how to drive at night so I wouldn’t be distracted. I knew popping the window open every so often to let the cold biting air gnaw on my face would keep me alert. I knew that the coffee in the center console would get me through to the destination. I knew my customer would be happy to get their package on time despite the freezing rainstorm. I knew if the ice got my car all I had to do was let off and turn into the slide.

I was wrong though.

The dashed lines going by, 4,366 of them lulled my attention away. The wind startled me, but it did nothing to keep me on my toes. My body rejected the caffeine. When the car hit the ice I panicked and I slammed on the brakes. I turned the wheel to point the car around the curve in the road. As physics laughed at my folly the car went around once, twice, more times than I could count. There was the sound of metal; shattering as my stomach slid into my throat. The car moved on every axis. There was no up or down, left or right.

Then it all came to a sudden stop. The car was caught by something hard. My face felt the warm caress of my own blood as I tried to get my bearings. The warmth was slowly replaced with a freezing chill. As the car sank into the lake my vision goes blurry. I couldn’t even get the energy to undo my buckle or fight to survive. The drive had taken all of my energy. I close my eyes and hoped that it would be over before my broken body realized what shape it was in. I was awarded that one last request at least.

&#x200B;

Prompt:I wrote this for TT, but it is 20 words under the limit. It was a serious attempt at poetry, but it didn't end up working to well I don't think. I attempted Trochaic Tetrameter with a simple rhyme scheme and spelling something out with the first letters. I hope you might find more enjoyment from this than I did.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Heaps of people bus’ling around;

Escape seems so impossible.

Lump in my throat, Feeling so drowned,

Pressure building, burs’ osscicle

Myocardium pound ‘n’ pound,

Extremities start to tremble.

I survey for an egress now!

Crowd shifting, changing, keeps me stuck

Av’nue of escape appears.

No hesitation; waste no luck,

Taking flight with shaky fears.

Break through to quiet space alone

Regulate my breathing slowly

Emanate

Aspirate

Think of blowing calm winds solely

Heaving thumping chest subsiding.

Eyes water as shame is rising.“Look I told you I don’t know anything about what Karen drank from the fridge,” My dramatic attempt to bang on the table was cut short by the handcuffs on my wrists.

&nbsp;

“The empty bottle had your name on it though.” Martha had been over this with me already. What kind of name for a detective is Martha anyway?  

&nbsp;

“Which anyone could have put on there! It was just a piece of tape. It could have been peeled off any of my lunches.”

&nbsp;

“No one else brings glassware into the office except you, Hazel.” My eye twitches in frustration.

&nbsp;

“Then the contents were switched out. I don’t even know where to get nightshade extrac-“The look on Martha’s face. The way that smug grin slowly creeped across her pursed lips told me everything. If only I had brought a memory loss potion, or a small bottle of transfiguration gel to turn her into a mouse.

&nbsp;

“Funny, I thought you didn’t know about anything in the bottle.”

&nbsp;

“Must have overheard someone talking”

&nbsp;

“No one knew about it until the reports came back from the lab thirty minutes ago.” I just shrugged. I absolutely couldn’t admit anything. This wasn’t murder or manslaughter; it was illegal medicinal synthesis charges. “Plead guilty to possession and transport of an illegal elixir and you could make parole in eight years. That sounds good, doesn’t it, Hazel?”

&nbsp;

“Stop. Using. That. Name.”

&nbsp;

“Oh, you don’t like being called Hazel? I imagine only someone who concocts these kinds of things would be offended by being called Haze. El.” Her tongue stuck to the roof of her mouth with that last syllable as a satisfied smile covered up her word hole.

&nbsp;

FDA oversight be damned. My freedom be damned. My life be damned. But I could not allow her to keep using that name. For witches everywhere I had to put this bitch in her place. I cracked down on one of my molars, mumbled a curse under my breath, and spat it in her face. 

&nbsp;

It was all on camera of course. I heard they use it for training now when interrogating possible witches. Rule one, don’t use a gross slur to spark rage. Rule two, interrogate over the speaker. That’s it. That is all that is needed to ensure no one ended up like Martha. That is all that is needed to ensure that an officer’s eyes aren’t dissolved, and all fluid in their body’s ph doesn’t plummet.

“Where are we going again, Mom,” Jess asked her mother.

&nbsp;

“We are going to see a doctor, sweetie.” Was the short but gentle response that came back. Dealia had been worried about her daughter for years now. Most kids were showing an affinity for some magic by two. Jess was six and had nothing to show. There was no levitation, apporting, flames, buffs, or other signs of magical prowess. This was unheard of in this day and age. Even if it was only a small bit, everyone could do something. Everyone except Jess.

&nbsp;

She had set up an appointment with Dr. Austin at the Magical Augmentation Institiute to have Jess looked at months ago. However it would be worthwhile to find out what was going on with her daughter. They arrived at the large white building and checked in. After filling out papers and waiting for what seemed like hours they were taken into an exam room where Jess changed into a simple medical smock. Then Jess was taken away by a nurse to go get tested, Dealia was unhappy that she had to stay behind, but this wasn’t about her so she held back her anger and waited.

&nbsp;

And waited.

&nbsp;

And waited.

&nbsp;

And when she thought she couldn’t wait anymore, she continued to wait.

&nbsp;

It was finally too much. She got up and grabbed the door handle, but it turned in her grip. A nurse opened the door right into her. “Oh I’m so sorry!” she said reaching out to check on Dealia’s face.

&nbsp;

“It’s fine. How’s Jess?” The mother looked worried. It had been too long for a normal result. What was wrong with her baby?

&nbsp;

“She is just fine. She is a good girl; such a trooper putting up with everything. I was coming to get you actually. Follow me please.” Picking up her things, Dealia followed her out of the room and down the hallway. There were many rooms with long windows running down the hallway. Unfortunately they were frosted and opaque. Finally she is guided into another room. There was a giant cylinderacal device that looked like a turbine of some sort standing vertically in the middle of the room. There were banks of computers around the room, and sitting in a chair kicking her feet back and forth was Jess.

&nbsp; 

“Mommy!” she yelled as she jumped down and came running over. “Dr. Austin says I’m a special girl!” she was absolutely beaming.’

&nbsp;

“I know you are! You’re my special little girl!” she picked her daughter up and hugged her. A middle aged man left his colleagues and came over to Dealia. “Ms. Bonner. Thank you for bring Jess in. I’m sorry I didn’t meet you earlier; I was held up in traffic. First, I’d like to assure you that as far as Jess’s magical abilities go there is nothing wrong. There is no stunted growth, or other physiological issue that may be causing the lack of her manifestations.” He smiles at her and motions for her to follow him. With Jess still in her arms she does so. “Jess is a special case. Look at this monitor and you will see the usual readings of the resonance test. There is a magical wavelength that most people are attuned to and the resonant machine creates a sympathetic reaction. We can measure magical potential this way.” The graph was a bunch of squiggles with a large peak as far as she could tell.

&nbsp;

“And Jess?”

&nbsp;

  Dr. Austin changed the window. This graph started at zero and…dipped. “Jess absorbs magic. Not just one she is attuned with though. The entire spectrum just gets pulled in. She is a black hole for mana as far as we can tell. As she gets older the effect will become greater. We’d like to keep seeing her to find out if we can have her control it or build something to keep it from being too powerful. Walking down the street she could cancel enchantments or breakdown any magical infrastructure in place. Existing in a developed city or town will be almost impossible for her.”

&nbsp; 

Dealia agreed of course. She didn’t want Jess to not be able to have friends or go to a good school, or enjoy her life however she wanted. Unfortunately the testing and training would end up getting to Jess. With the onset of puberty years later and the death of her mother Jess would burn everything to the ground in her despair.A depository for stories written by Cody_Fox23 as well as highlights of stories they like.
