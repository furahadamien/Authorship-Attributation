And lo, Jesus spake, saying, "Didst thou drinketh of thy neighbor's wine?And lie with thy neighbor's wife?For are not these things that thy father in Heaven hath forbidden?"Unto Jesus Chad replieth, "Lord, thou knoweth mine neighbor's wife doth smelleth of leprosy.But drinketh of his wine did Brad, who calleth unto me, saying 'Chad, I wager I can drinketh more wine than thee.Thou drinketh as would a small child.'After we dranketh the wine, I did sleep on mine neighbor's floor.I awoketh with mine neighbor's wife knowing me."
