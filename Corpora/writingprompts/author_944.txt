"Hi, uh... so, I think I might have been the victim of a prank, but..."

...

"I see.So, this really is Hell's telephone number, is that it?"...

"Well, whether I believe it or not, there's... uh... look, my daughter asked for a pony, see?"...

"That's not really relevant, is it?I mean, yes, obviously she likes it, but..."

...

"Of course it's a problem!Where am I supposed to keep a twelve-hundred-pound horse?!"...

"No, I didn't weigh it!It was an estimate!"...

"Is there someone else there I can talk to?"...

"Hi, so, listen, I was just telling the other..."

...

"As in, like, *Satan?* Hell's head honcho?"...

"For starters, I always pictured hi... you... as a male."...

"No, I've never been particularly religious, but the presence of a sulfur-spewing equine on my front lawn is making me rethink a few things.That is, as I've been trying to say, the reason for my call!Now, can you *please* explain why my front garden has been reduced to charcoal?!"...

"She's four years old!She obviously meant 'Santa!'She just can't spell very well!Furthermore, I don't recall the words 'fire,' 'flaming,' or 'total destruction of meticulously maintained property' appearing anywhere in her letter!"...

"At the moment?She's riding around on its back."...

"'Fluffy Sunshine,' I think.Look, why does any of this matter?!I can't keep a horse  one spawned from Hell or otherwise  on my property!"...

"What?Oh, yes.No, I didn't open it.I was a bit preoccupied."...

"Why?Is there going to be a tiny, fire-breathing quail in it or something?"...

"Fine.Hang on."...

"It's a wallet."...

"No, no, I get it: It's because dads *always* get wallets, right?It's always wallets or ties."...

"Sure, thanks, happy Christmas to you, too.Now, can we please di... hello?*Hello?!*"

...

"God damn it."

FADE IN:

INT.A CORPORATE BOARDROOM  DAY

*Several men and women in suits sit around a large table, all of them looking bored.At the front of the room, a man with a white beard flicks at the black eyepatch that he wears.This is ODIN.*

**ODIN:** You know, I was supposed to get the wisdom of the ages.*Halfhearted murmurs are offered by everyone at the table.*

**ODIN:** (*CONT'D*) There I was, thinking I'd be granted some kind of sublime knowledge.Do you know what I got?*A blond-haired man with a neatly trimmed beard sighs.This is THOR.*

**THOR:** A bunch of old wives' tales and some herbal remedies?**ODIN:** A bunch of old... hey!**THOR:** And when you asked for a refund, Mimir told you to...

*A breathtakingly beautiful woman  SIF  interrupts.*

**SIF:** (*Interrupting*) He told you to go sit on a glacier.**ODIN:** Now, look, if you people are just going to...

*A sudden flash of light interrupts Odin.When the room's illumination returns to normal, a very confused young man is revealed.This is DAVE.He is clad in a pink apron and is clutching a black spatula.*

**ODIN:** (*CONT'D*) ... huh.That hasn't happened in a while.**DAVE:** Yeah, I'm reasonably certain that pancakes aren't normally supposed to do that.**SIF:** Do what?**DAVE:** I'm not sure.What just happened?*A middle-aged woman grins with glee.This is HEL.*

**HEL:** You died!**DAVE:** I think I'd remember that.**THOR:** No, that's definitely what happened.*Dave glances around.*

**DAVE:** Heaven looks really boring.**THOR:** This is Valhalla.**DAVE:** Valhalla looks really boring.Why am I in Valhalla?**ODIN:** Good question.Only warriors who die in battle are supposed to come here.**DAVE:** You must get a lot of soldiers, then.**SIF:** Actually, no, we don't.See, you *don't* have to die in battle; you have to die holding a weapon.**DAVE:** Soldiers carry guns!Guns are weapons!**HEL:** Not according to Section Nine, Paragraph Four of the Valhalla Bylaws!*Everyone in the room save for Dave and Hel groans with impatience.*

**DAVE:** The what?**THOR:** Don't encourage her.**HEL:** According to our charter, a weapon is an object which renders injury or death.**DAVE:** ...So, a gun?**HEL:** No, a bullet.**DAVE:** That seems like a remarkably stupid technicality.**THOR:** *You're* a remarkably stupid technicality!**ODIN:** He might be, actually.*All eyes in the room turn to face Odin.*    

**SIF:** Huh?**ODIN:** Well, what's that in his hand?**DAVE:** It's a spatula.**ODIN:** I know it's a spatula... but what *is* it?**THOR:** ... A spatula.**ODIN:** You're not getting it.What *is* a spatula?*A sudden thought seems to occur to Dave.*

**DAVE:** Hang on!Why does Valhalla look like an office building?**HEL:** We had to redefine a pen as weapon a few decades ago.**DAVE:** Because it's mightier than the sword?**HEL:** Because a disgruntled accountant stabbed his coworker with one.**DAVE:** Oh.I take it he lost that fight.**THOR:** He...    
**DAVE:** (*Interrupting*) Since he died, I mean.**THOR:** He actually slipped and hit his head while running away.**SIF:** He wouldn't stop screaming, so we redesigned Valhalla to make him calm down.**DAVE:** And... what?You just kept it this way?**HEL:** (*Shrugging*) Eh.*Odin slams his fist on the table.*

**ODIN:** Enough!I swear, you people will drone on about the dullest things!**THOR:** (*Muttering*) You mean like trading your eye for a chicken soup recipe?**ODIN:** Now, for the last time: What is a spatula?*Several seconds of silence pass.*

**THOR:** It's...    
**ODIN:** (*Interrupting*) Don't say "a spatula."**THOR:** Well, it is.**SIF:** You mean... are you asking if it counts as a weapon?**ODIN:** Finally!Yes.**THOR:** You could have been direct about it.**ODIN:** (*In a mocking voice*) "You could have been direct about it."Shut up.**THOR:** You're an ass.**HEL:** I think it counts as a weapon.**SIF:** Odin's ass?**THOR:** Only after taco night.**HEL:** *The spatula!*   
**SIF:** Is it forged from celestial iron or something?*Dave examines his spatula.*

**DAVE:** No, I think it's just plastic.**HEL:** It counts!It can render injury or death!**DAVE:** Hey, my pancakes aren't *that* bad!**HEL:** We are not concerned with your pancakes; we're talking about the spatula.**SIF:** Do you ever say a word so often that it starts to sound funny?**THOR:** Spa-tu-la.**ODIN:** Spa-tuuuuu-la.**SIF:** Spaaaaa-tu-la.**DAVE:** (*Shouting*) Confused!*Confused!*

*Dave closes his eyes and starts waving his spatula in front of him.It smacks on the top of Odin's head several times.*

**ODIN:** Ow!Ow!Stop it!Stop it!Ow!**HEL:** There!See?!That's an injury!*Dave stops flailing and opens one eye.*

**DAVE:** Oh, god, sorry, I...    
**THOR:** (*Interrupting*) Odin.**DAVE:** What?**ODIN:** What?**THOR:** No, not... ugh.He said "god."That's the other guy.**SIF:** Technically, it's an unspecified deity.You're thinking of Jehovah.**HEL:** It's "Yeshua" now.**THOR:** No, that's his son.We go drinking on Tuesdays.**ODIN:** When *don't* you go drinking?Lazy layabout.*Thor snatches the spatula from Dave and brandishes it at Odin.*

**THOR:** You want to go, old man?Huh?**SIF:** (*To Hel*) Huh, look at that.I guess you're right.**HEL:** That settles it.The spatula is a weapon.*Odin snatches the spatula from Thor and whacks him over the head with it.*

**ODIN:** Any more like that out of you, and you're grounded!*Thor sits back and sulks.Odin turns the spatula over in his hands a few times.*

**ODIN:** (*CONT'D*) I mean...I guess.Sure, why not?It's better than that stupid pen.**HEL:** That was plastic, too, by the way.*Odin hands the spatula back to Dave, who looks uncertain.*

**DAVE:** So, uh... does that mean I'm staying?**HEL:** It looks that way.**SIF:** Yeah, welcome to Valhalla, I guess.**DAVE:** Great.Now that everything is cleared up, I just have one question.**THOR:** The bathroom is down the hall.**DAVE:** Huh?Oh, no, thanks, but I was actually curious about something else.**ODIN:** What troubles you, warrior?*Dave takes a deep breath.*

**DAVE:** How the hell did I even die?!*Hel takes out her smartphone and scrolls through something.*

**HEL:** It looks like the batter mix you used was contaminated... with cyanide.**DAVE:** ... That seems incredibly unlikely.**HEL:** Well, that's what happened.**THOR:** I guess your pancakes *were* that bad!*Dave stares at Thor for a moment, then whacks him with the spatula.*

CUT TO BLACK.

The Devil went down to Georgia     
Where he got his red ass whupped     
Johnny was proud     
And he said out loud     
"I'll never be one-upped!"But as that challenge echoed     
Out into the Georgia blue     
The Lord jumped in          
With his violin     
Said, "It's time for round two!""You're getting mighty cocky,"     
Said the Lord, "Now you're in trouble!""That kind of pride,    
"I won't abide!"It's nothing or it's double!"Well, Johnny tightened up his strings    
He said "Don't make me groan!"I'll take the bet,     
"But what I get    
"Is a day upon your throne!"There came a flash of lightning      
And the Lord said "You're all in!"But if you lose,     
"You'll take a cruise     
"Into oblivion!"Johnny, now you're in too deep; that fiddle better sing!'Cause now you're up against the guy who made everything!If you win, you get a chance to rule both great and small     
But if you lose, you won't exist at all...The Lord rosined up his bow     
And said "This will be quick!"I know some things     
"On Heaven's strings     
"That ought to do the trick!"With a mighty flourish     
The Lord began his line     
And his fiddle played     
A serenade     
That was quite divine:

&nbsp;

               
[ANGELIC MUSIC PLAYS]      
               

&nbsp;

When the Lord had finished     
Johnny only rolled his eyes     
"If that's your best,     
"Just take a rest,    
"And witness your demise!"&nbsp;

              
Rationality that you can't resist!Jehovah's in a fight with an atheist!All of Heaven's angels start to grieve!You can't beat a man who doesn't believe!&nbsp;

The Lord, he raised an eyebrow, saying "Johnny, you've been cheating!"There's no sense smiting you, boy, if you can't feel the beating!"Johnny said "I'll tell you what, just save those declarations."I'm so high, I've been playing the fiddle against hallucinations!"And he played:

&nbsp;

              
Eating all the mushrooms and seeing stuff!The Lord and the Devil have both had enough!But Johnny has a question buried deep within:     
Where did he find a golden violin?&nbsp;

          !
