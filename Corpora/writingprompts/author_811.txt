Well, traditional morality would say its not a great idea.I personally, am rather a fan.While I wasnt exactly Hitler, I was an executive, a damn good one too.It didnt take long to end up managing money for the blue team.The red team doesnt even have any money to manage, communism and all, so as much as I dont like the guy personally, Pinochet isnt the worst person to work for.Of course, some of us try to stay neutral, or even good, the scientists and doctors and engineers who just happened to believe the wrong thing.Some of them even succeed for a while, but I know that I didnt.That said, Pinochet's side could be worse, as long as you arent a communist, you get on fine, and can operate as best you want to in the free market.Since death is not a threat, torture and exile are the main threats.But if so the right things, in the right places, and at the right times, they are surprisingly easy to avoid.Maybe someday I might learn science from one of the RnD guys, quit the money side of things, and go into science.For now however, I have some fingers to break, and some loan payments to procure.
