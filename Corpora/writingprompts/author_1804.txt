Standing outside the great room is nerve-racking.Having to wait without consolation while the ancient Hoomahns yell at one another is by far the worst part of my day.But this is a necessary sacrifice, freely given.It comes with being the house guardian of an influential family.Me and my ancestors have served our house for seven generations, and this is a role that fills me with pride.The doors open and a draft of stale, yet perfumed air rushes out.A scent of fermentation and smoke enters my nose-- I smell him, my master.Embarrassingly, my tail is wagging again.I've tried for years to always carry myself with the stoic dignity my office demands, but I suppose there is no overcoming instinct...

My master holds and shakes his hands with the other high-ranking Hoomahns.The yelling has stopped.A few of them are crying.My tail is thankfully still by now, but some of the less experienced guardians let out small yelps.Their masters glance over in slight annoyance.The lesser guardians lower their heads from the humbling lesson, but I suppose they must learn sooner or later.My master looks at me and I tighten with anticipation as he silently mouths "good boy."My tail wags once again ...(sigh).The light of the great room diminishes as the Hoomahns exit, one by one.The last to leave is my master.Slowly he reaches his hand to my head and gives an affirming rub.His fermentation is exceptionally strong today.He looks into my eyes with an accepting stare and it takes the full muster of my training not to look at the floor.He says to me:

"Benji, you have been a fine house guardian...The best, in fact.But my time has come.I have lived long enough, taken enough, and it would be quite an act of hubris not to admit that I'm more of a hindrance than help nowadays.Today was my last meeting with the high council.I have my replacement coming to meet you in just a few moments."It's true, my master is supremely ancient.History records that he is five-hundred-and-five years old (the oldest master I've ever met) but he seems older.I can't help but whine a little before my training takes hold again.Master looks at me with a look of love and pets me once more.Just then a small Hoomahn arrives in our presence."Oh Benji, let me introduce you to my granddaughter.""Grandfather...Thank you.""No my dear, thank *you*.Be well."Master relaxes.A light fills the room with a warmness I've never before experienced.As master's body starts to dissolve into the ether, he looks at me once more and mouths "good boy."I can't help but cry a little."Goodbye" I think as he disappears."Well," the younger master says to me "how should we start our new house?"
