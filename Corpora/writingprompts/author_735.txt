In the day, the cars zoom by, engines roaring, tires screeching.They'd kill you without a second thought.I've seen it happen.The sun beats down, warming your being into a sense of pleasant sleepiness, but this, too, can be dangerous.On some days, when you rest, you may wake up to a crowd of teenagers, cheering and throwing stones.On others, you may not wake at all, torn between extreme thirst and no strength left to quench it.My best friend and most loyal pack mate stopped to rest in a parking lot and woke up with his fur burnt off, skin melted into the hot tar.I barked for help, but none came.So now I sleep in the shade.As dangerous as the day was, I preferred it.I learned to avoid most of the dangers, and made use of the daylight to find food in the trash cans.But at night, the ghouls come out.They walk, staggering from left to right, and drive differently.Worse.Sometimes, they carry bottles.Sometimes, they throw them.Sometimes they chase me, but slowly and clumsily.The ghouls come out, and they steal from the good men.They burn foul odors into the air and suck it into their chest.In the day, I can sometimes beg food from the good men.At night, I only run from the ghouls.Most of the time I avoid them, but I've actually encountered them once.It had been a warm day, and I'd salvaged bits of crust from a pizza box in an alleyway.I curled up on the box to nap, and when I woke, it was dark.And a ghoul stood before me.He was a shorter, older one who smelled of burger grease and cigarettes.He wore a mask over his head that hid his ears.A gun was tucked into the seat of his pants.He pointed it at a passerby and shouted something.They stopped.I felt a growl rising from deep within me.I did not like this ghoul.He turned towards me as I got up from my napping spot and jumped him.His eyes widened as my teeth fastened around his ankles, and a cracking noise, so loud it hurt my ears, came from the metal tube.My back hurt.The ghoul kicked me off and moved up to kick me again, but something flung him back.That was the last thing I saw before I fell back asleep.My back no longer hurt.It just felt wet.I woke up on a stone floor with sticky cloth on my back.Someone had fastened a plastic cone around my head and placed bowls of food and water in the corner.I ate.It was good.But I was stuck.It was a small room that served as my prison.It was always daytime, but never warm.I could smell other dogs nearby, and hear a few farther out, but all I had was a rug to sleep on and no room to run.Sometimes, men would walk by and look at me.Sometimes, ghouls would do the same.Once in a while, a man would come and take me out to explore.If I behaved, he'd give me extra food.A long time passed, and the fur grew back on my back.The man came in again and took me outside.He gave my leash to someone I'd never seen before.I smelled him.He smelled okay.He scratched me behind the ears and talked.Then he took me to his car.That night, I slept in the dark in a new place.I had a bed, a few toys, a throw pillow I took from the couch, and a sock I found behind it.They were better to chew than the toys.In the morning, the man came back and we went to the park.I had a family.I was home.
