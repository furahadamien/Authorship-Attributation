There were some that called it a sign from God, another purging of humanity like the great flood.I never cared, all that I needed to know was that they were smart, and didn't like to go underground, best place for safe houses in my opinion.I was in one of these so called safe houses, if a sewer tunnel filled with lamps and sleeping bags counts as a house, that I first heard these claims.Left that particular house after that conversation, it wasn't safe.The bastards killed everyone there, by the time I returned the tunnel had collapsed.No signs of life anywhere.4 weeks ago humanity was attacked by a race of unknown origin.Humanity fought back but it was useless.These things, or "clickers" as the survivor colonies refer to them due to their habit of releasing a strange clicking sound, ever seen that movie Predator?Like the predator clicks.Anyway these clickers were ruthless and brutally efficient.Russia was the first major nation to go down, falling in only 7 hours, soon all of Asia was conquered.Fast forwards 4 weeks and humans have become rats, running through tunnels, breaching the surface only for food or water.Under earth is safer than above it.I don't know why but they hate it underground, they won't search through tunnels too often.But if they know someone's there they will come.On this particular day I was sleeping in an above ground safe house.More accurately in one of the cars of an abandoned military train.The thing was perfect, armored, still functioning partway so it was warm and could lock up very tightly.I was bundled in my sleeping bag in a car that had the doors sealed tight.I had awoken from a sound I had heard outside.Namely the gunshots.That was about 30 minutes ago.But 2 minutes previously I thought I had heard a familiar clicking.I inhaled and sure enough the stench of motor oil and salt water hit my nostrils, an odd odor that clickers emitted.Suddenly the side of the car rattled as someone, or something, tried to open the door.It rattled a few more times before there was a bang that blasted the door into pieces.The clicker regarded me, I don't actually know what the things look like, they're always wearing the same armor, rectangular slabs of metal.It raised a serrated blade and charged.I stumbled backwards and my left hand fell into an open control panel full of wires I had to cut to disable the alarm systems on the cars.There was still electricity in those cables.I was expecting a massive pain, I'd maybe to blackout.What I wasn't expecting was for the energy to travel down my arm and then blast from my other hand straight into the clicker.Whatever metal that armor was apparently conducted electricity as the clicker shrieked, then collapsed into the ground, smoke pouring from in between the plates.I looked at my hand, blue energy danced from my fingers, suddenly a loud howl broke the eerie silence, a howl that meant a clicker had heart the blast.The things were slow, I likely had 5 minutes.I had packed my bag and was about to go when I glanced at the dead clicker.Curiosity struck but I still needed to get away.Do I: Run or Investigate the Body
Edit: continuing story.I ran over to the thing, maybe finally a chance to see what they looked like, that metal was probably valuable as well.I looked all over the armor and finally found a small blue pad on the neck, I pressed it and with hissing steam the plates folded away revealing the front of the thing.I understood now why they covered their faces.The skin was like tanned cow hide, it was covered in what looks like blisters.The eyes were dark and hollow.The worst part was the mandible jaw.Strangely if the mandible jaw was closed the creature might look human.The howling got louder.I remembered I was on a schedule, I grabbed anything that looked useful.An odd device that looked like  a flashlight with a grip and trigger, a few plates of armor, and the blade it had held.A blade that resembled a knife sized serrated Khopesh.Now I had picked up a few tricks since this whole thing went down, one of which was that most clickers with the exception of a few that has been wearing red plates instead of black, seemed to be blind.A scientist I had met in the first week said the clicking was echolactation, wait that wasn't it... Oh who cares.They relied on smell to distinguish each other and that armor still had the salty oil smell.I put the plates back  into place, with a groan hoisted the dead clicker out, lay down in the armor and pressed the blue button.The layers closed down and everything was dark, of course if these things things were blind a visor wasn't needed.The second thing I noticed was that there was still a LOT of electricity surging through the armor.Now I'm no scientist but I'm fairly certain I should have been cooked alive.No time for that now.I tried to tear the helmet off and somehow succeeded.I sprinted out of there, the armor surprisingly light, snagging my pack under my arm as I ran.7 years, and many incinerations, electrocutions, crushings, and drownings later the clickers finally retreated.Leaving behind only a strange gold box, oddly resembling an Egyptian coffin.Nobody could open it.I walked up to it and slid the blade I'd carried for seven years into a small slot in the box.It clicked and opened and I was staring at my own dead body...

Roger woke with a start."Okay that's it, no more pizza before sleep."
