"History repeats itself."The saying must have been thousands of years old thought Titus as his eyes lingered on the inscription under the doorway leading to the K.R.O.N.O.S.jump room.Titus approached the large display and logged the last machine off for the night.The soft blue light quickly dimmed and the humming of the temporal governor ceased at the other end of the room.Titus removed the K.R.O.N.O.S.key and mentally consulted his nightly to-do list one last time before clocking off.As he stood an orange light appeared in his periphery and commanded his attention.It was the soft orange glow of a machine in boot sequence.There were no more arrivals scheduled for the evening, he had checked the log twice.Who turned this machine on?The machine quickly booted and the blue light announced that it was ready to receive.Titus approached the mouth of the receptical and the blue light changed to green."A jump, admin is going to be pissed."Titus thought.The machine hummed faster and the green light strobed to indicate a full jump transfer.Titus pulled the cover back on the receptical and was surprised to see a young man with his chest heaving and hands grasping out toward Titus.He helped the man out and to the recovery bay reflexively.As he did, the bright orange of the man's shirt told Titus that this would be the only time he'd see this young man.What a shame to waste an apprenticeship at the esteemed K.R.O.N.O.S.institute on an off-the-books jump thought Titus.He skoffed as he dropped the man to the recovery chair."Who are you?"Titus demanded flatly."Phred Cassock" he replied.Titus threw the man a towel."Well Phred, you just performed an unlicensed jump, you're lucky this machine decided to boot up when it did."The brown curls of the man's hair sprung back into place as he wiped his head down with a heaving effort."I've got to report this to admin."Titus croaked, his arms crossed."After what I saw, I don't even care" the man managed to say as he reclined into the chair.Titus looked over his shoulder."What'd you see?You know what, it doesn't matter, get the hell out of here and enjoy your last night as a free man.""I was right, it was him."The man replied as Titus walked to the door ushering his unwelcome guest along."I saw him again, common era this time.He didn't recognize me at fist but I recognized him."Titus' face was unreadable but he paused."You've jumped before this?"Phred stared back hesitating."I've seen the same man three times now over the course of 7,000 years.It's not a coincidence.His name is Dev.""Temporal stalking isn't a thing orange-shirt."Titus said opening the peronium security door."No, not stalking.He wasn't licensed, I've checked.""There are no unlicensed jumps, the system doesn't -"
"No, he wasn't a jumper."Phred interrupted."He was some kind of holy man.A public figure just like last time.But this time he acted different.Callous, jaded.""So?"Titus spat."He's not a jumper, he's been alive the whole time.How else could he be a historical figure without disrupting the temporal flow?"It took a moment for this impossible statement to unravel its meaning in Titus' overworked head."No" was all he thought to say.Phred continued, "it seemed the world had beaten the spark out of him but he was happy to see me, I could tell.He's almost figured out the question."Titus couldn't bear the nonsense any longer."Out!"he yelled as the young man in the orange shirt jumped."Your story needs some work before you get picked up by KPD tomorrow."Phred closed his mouth.He was right.There were more pressing matters than explaining to this glorified security guard that he'd found a way to stop the temporal inevitability.Dev was the key.He needed to jump again.Tonight.
