"Burgi!So you made it!"Morlaoth, the necromancer, exclaimed."I guess your pillaging went well yesterday?"Burgi furrowed his gigantic brow in concentration."Pillage... good.Burgi kill... many.Make much gold."He breathed a sigh of relief after the last word.His throat was still sore from all that shouting."Good, good," Morlaoth agreed."Here's your chair.Sorry about the guts, I had no time to clean before you came.Undead uprising, you know."Burgi nodded.The door gave an ominous creak, and Morlaoth clapped his hands, giddy with excitement, as his undead butler went to welcome his other guests.A hand touched his shoulder."Eek!"Morlaoth gave a strangled screech as he whirled around."What?Art thou afeared?"The voice came from nowhere."You - You've done the invisible thing again, Domalia," Morlaoth squeaked.The air fizzled, and Domalia appeared."Thy guards like me not, Morlaoth.'Tis a matter of my safety.""Oh, of course, of course."Morlaoth muttered nervously."Ah... your seat."He gestured to an empty seat, and the beautiful sorceress lowered herself into it.A tiny goblin hobbled into the room."Ciank!"Morlaoth exclaimed, "You made it!""Yes, yes.No thanks to that one, of course," the goblin said, inclining his head towards Burgi."His warriors have been on my lands for a week now."He shook his head."But no matter."As Morlaoth and the goblin king made themselves comfortable, Domalia started setting up her folder."Oh, Domalia, you can't be the Suburb Master!"Morlaoth cried in dismay."Who will be the mom?""Thou shalt be the mom if thou so chooseth," Domalia muttered."If thou art not too...scared.""I already made my character sheet, Domalia," Morlaoth whined."It took me ages, and my blood-ink was drying out."Domalia glowered at him, her red eyes really giving it the right effect."Now shalt be the reading of the character sheets.Burgi, thou shalt go first.""Name - Burger.Race - Football.Class - No."Burgi read with difficulty."Burger?That's practically the same as your name!"Morlaoth exclaimed.He started to say more, but found his mouth clamped shut by magical forces.Domalia's voice shook the dust from the rafters far above them."It shalt be as he hath chosen!""His race can't be football, though, can it?And he has to choose a class, surely."Ciank argued.Domalia held her head in her hands."Burger do... football race.Burger not... in class, busy football race."Burgi explained laboriously."That meaneth Burger's class is athlete," Domalia explained gently."And race meaneth... what colour person Burger is.""Burger... person colour!"Burgi exclaimed.Then, after looking at the glowering soot-coloured elf, the annoyed, milk-white necromancer, and the disinterested green goblin, he amended his statement."Uh, red-white, like Burgi."Making the necessary changes to Burgi's character sheet, Domalia asked, "Sex?"Morlaoth stifled a snicker as Burgi turned bright red."Women.Only women."Morlaoth started to correct Burgi, but Domalia had already written *female* in the appropriate spot."Okay, all thy stats appear to be in order.Morlaoth, what is thy character?""Morgan, a male Caucasian necromancer," Morlaoth smirked.Domalia made a face."There are no necromancers allowed," she hissed, turning her glowering eyes back on.Morlaoth frowned."That's a bit harsh, Domalia.Why not?"Domalia shook her head."There is no necromancy in the game."Morlaoth was shaken.He shuffled through his papers for a second, finding the sheet of approved classes.His face went even whiter."I - I guess a doctor?"His voice shook as he spoke."And thy stats are acceptable," Domalia nodded."Ciank?""Charlie, male African-American toddler," the goblin croaked."Thou art aware that toddler is the weakest class?"Domalia asked, tapping her pen on Morlaoth's stone table."Yes."Ciank offered no further explanation."Morlaoth, since thou art the most powerful and oldest of the players, thou shalt be the dad.Burgi, thou art a *teenager* in, uh, *high school.* Thou wilt have to go to class, so thou canst be on the football team.Ciank, thou requireth a *babysitter* or thou mayst go to *preschool.*"
