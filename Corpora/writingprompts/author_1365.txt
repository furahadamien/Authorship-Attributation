It was all over the news recently, crop circles showing up all over the world.I was one of the few who truly believed.Who truly believed the humans were real.The rest blamed the crop circles on pranksters, but I knew better.It was humans, coming in on their space ships.They were trying to warn us.Warn us of all the dangers that existed in space.All the dangers coming for us.Nobody believed me, but I knew they would.A year later, that statement became true.People who believed in humans, people who knew what I knew, were all over the news!They spoke of the humans, and how they were trying to save us.And with that, the movement began.People finally started believing the threat to our world.The people of the world rebelled, governments toppled.The world fell into anarchy, whilst it was waiting in fear for their way of life.Some human teenagers looked down onto the planet and what they had caused with their little prank.One of them said, We really should not have accepted that dare.
