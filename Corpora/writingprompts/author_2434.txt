" It feels like just yesterday that the morning news was plastered with my handiwork - 
'Yet another building erupts in flames'
However, I wasn't around to see it.I was busy taking care of one of my many enemies, one of these men who called themselves heroes.He entered my lair just as I'd expected him to, straight into my trap.Now, held by steel ropes, his formidable strength helped him no more.It didn't take very long.I shot him in the head with my third favorite gun, and disposed of his body as I usually would.Most villains would take back a souvenir, but I've always thought that that was just egotistical.Besides, of what use is a finger or some other body part to me?Most of these "heroes" die with a look of surprise on their face.As if they'd expected more time to formulate a plan.As if I'd give them a chance to live.Nobody knows of me, and that's because I never cared for recognition.If I wanted publicity, I'd have bought a billboard.Honestly, I did it because I wanted to.Because I felt like it.Others felt like partying, I felt like causing mayhem.It's just who I am.Though I worked alone, I've met other villains.By met, I mean I've been absolutely bored by them, just... in person.All of them drone on forever and ever about their last heinous crime.None of them bother with the subtleties, or the art of getting away clean.They all died, eventually - some because of their ego and flamboyance, and others because I just didn't like them enough.I've done this for 8 years, and I haven't left a trace.That city bored me, and so I decided to move..."

"I'm sorry, who are you again?""Oh, I'm your neighbour, Bob.It's really nice to meet you."I don't think Bob ever slept.Weird.
