In these times, it's impossible to keep anything safe.You might even have your own family break in for some money.The people are greedy and the world is floaded with beings.My years being in the military were long painful and absolutely terrifying.I given jobs to do like take care of the children's choir, cook and basically be everyone's bitch.I loved it actually.The structure kept me going, it really fueled my confidence.I knew that something great was going to be accomplished and I couldn't be happier.I was taking the younger soliders out for drill one day and they fell and 'broke his knee'.I called him a fucking baby and took him to the nurse.I was walking away from the nurses station and there was a large group of high ups standing there.One of them called me over.I immediately ran over asking if there was anything I could help with.They agreed stating it was private buisness and we should speak about it elsewhere.I followed.We arrived in a very fancy office.The General asked me to have a seat.I was surrounded by the rest of the officers."Sergeant, can I ask you something?"Said the General."Yes General, ask me anything" I said happily."Earth is doomed in a matter of years with a mystical dagger that causes anyone killed by it to instantly resurrect on an alternate Earth that does not share the same fate.""Oh no, what do we do?"I exclaimed."Well, another bad bit of news, we may have made a weapon of sorts.. it may destroy the world if we don't handle this as soon as possible."I.The same breath he says "Would you allow us to kill you to save the earth?My response "oh my god!what about the children!"
