Josh woke up to a light snore coming from the other side of the bed.Horrible hair, acne, and an extra 50 pounds were not making this girl any favors."Fuuuck, I've drank way too much last night", Josh thought, before smiling to himself "I've never slept with an ugly girl, but woke up next to plenty.Lemmy, you fucking genius!"He got up, and searched for his boxers for a short while and then giving up and settling for his pants."Cellphone, wallet, ID, still some money left, and condoms?FUCK!""Josh, baby, what the fuck are you doing this early?"The fuck came out of his mouth a little too loud, and now Melissa was awake.Her voice still muffled from a long night's sleep."Be right back, Mel.Just drinking something!".He wasn't expecting her to wake up.He just wanted to get out and forget this night, hopefully with more alcohol."I have all the important stuff, I could just get the fuck out.But how do I explain leaving my shirt?Fuck, fuck, fuck.O have no idea how to handle this."Josh's train of thought stopped when he reached the kitchen.The place was a mess.Left overs of a least three different meals were rotting at the table.Dirty glasses packed the sink.Beer cans were left in every surface that could hold one.Absolutely disgusting.He wouldn't dare to touch one of those cups even if his life depended on it.Searching time, *something * had to be clean.Going through bowls, plates, and mugs, he found something that he could use.A dusty  white mug with the words #675,440,391 DAD.Those mugs were rare to be seen, but Josh instantly recognized it.They would update your Dad Score whenever used.They sold quite a lot in the first few months, but as soon as people begun to notice how much of a shitty parents they were, the antes plummeted.Bruised egos are not good for marketing."Holy shit!"Josh thought to himself "This number is high as fuck.Well, at least it explains why it was so easy for this happy little accident to happen".The mug was a little dusty, and it seemed like it had not been used for months, but it was cleaner than everything else in the room.Josh washed it and filled it with tap water.As he chugged it down, the mug begun to vibrate.As he looked at it, he saw the words:
