-Haven't seen any episode of The Crocodile Hunter, so I stalked the other replies to get a feel of what he was like.-Please point out any inconsistencies between the real Steve Irwin and the one I've fabricated, and I'll make the appropriate changes.G'day and welcome to Myth Hunter.I'm Steve Irwin, and today, we're gonna wrangle an Arachne.Legendary beast this one is - half woman, half spider.Sits on humans to breed killer spiders to carry on the legacy.Locals say she's still mad about the whole Athena thing, and that bringing it up only makes her angrier - bet they found out *that* one the 'ard way.Anyway, been stalkin' these grounds for round about an hour now, started pickin' up a real solid trail somethin' like fifteen minutes ago.Judgin' by the bloody stench, think I'm nearin' her cave now.Ah!There she is!Marvellous creature, ain't she?Yeah, yeah marvelously dangerous too: ya never know when she'll strike ya until you're bleeding to death on the ground.That's why we gotta be extra careful with her.Basilisks?Easy.Centaurs?Gotta run a lil bit if they happen to see ya, but nothing too tough.Cyclopses?Piece of cake.Sea serpents?As long as you can swim, you're fine.The Arachne, though - she'll have ya'n before ya know what's goin' on.Luckily, this 'ere afterlife's got a lot more stuff than the world of the livin', I'll tell ya that.Back there, t'was nothin' but a rope and yer own guts.'ere, though, ya got all sorts o' gimmicks you could use.'ere, lemme show ya.First up's the bag itself.Unlimited capacity, this one 'as.In'ere, I got a coil o' never-ending rope, - keeps the good ol' mortal days alive - some InstaFreeze, so I can stun the beast until I get a nice and good hold of it, and a flask o' water that automatically refills when empty.Some good pickin's right 'ere, this is.Gonna tie this rope on two ends at the mouth o' the cave - leave a nice lil trap for her.The Arachne's one of the most paranoid creatures in existence, so gotta be real careful here - make sure she doesn't hear me.Alright good, trap's in place, and I'm still alive.Now for some bait.Like I said, this one's mighty paranoid, so the tiniest noise will trigger her.These rocks oughtta do it.I'll just chuck 'em by the mouth o' the cave, and...

Yep!She's out!And...and...come on, trip on the rope!Yeah, got 'er down!Just gonna spray her head with some InstaFreeze so she doesn't behead me: of course, I can't die, already bein' dead an' all, but it would be one heck of a problem to walk around carryin' ma head in a basket or somethin' just so I can see, and eat, and stuff.There, we're safe now.Just gonna wrap my hands around as much of her huge neck as possible, and shake it 'round.Gosh, this feels good: so much power.Crikey!Looks like the spray's wearin' off.Gotta run before there won't be any more runnin' for me!Won't be able to get that rope back though, damn it.Really liked that one.Anyway, catch me next week to see me takin' on a massive fire-breathing dragon.That's all for tonight, folks, I'm Steve Irwin, signin' off.EDIT: It was pointed out that Steve Irwin would never swear, so I edited that out.
