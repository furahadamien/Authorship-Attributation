This is the way the world ends.Not with a whisper, but a cough.First symptom, before it takes over.Second and fatal?The skin starts rotting away, slowly.Makes doors useless.How can you open up a door, without a fingerprint?Thankfully, doors can be hacked.I let myself into Dr. Hartnagel's house, clutching Salvation in my three fingered hand.She is a sharp one, and she is thirsty.My father was the one who named her, and the one who told me.Passed down from generation to generation, the knife that took away life, to give it anew.When I killed with it, I saw them.Arriving on that distant earth.Alive.Free of any marks I had made of them.Free of all injuries.The virus in them was still there, but with it's long incubation time, they would have, oh, about twenty or so years longer to live.That's fine.I had saved many.So had my father.And my grandmother.All the way back since 13 March 1964.They all knew that sending people to that earth was the only way to save anyone.I was just the first generation to be alive during the end times.There were a few conditions to Salvation.Firstly, there had to be at least one other witness.Secondly, Salvation had to be held by a family member.Sadly, my own "member" was useless.I am the last angel.And just in time.The virus around the earth would kill off everyone in, working from my family's knowledge of when the last human will die, two years and change.Me?I think I have just a few days left.And that's fine actually.I'm kind of tired anyway.I crept carefully over the hallway, avoiding the sight of the Camera-Drone.I couldn't have that following me, and it doesn't count as a witness, as I discovered with Samantha.When you're on a mission to save everyone, with so little time, you have to be so careful who you choose.I could have just killed the homeless, the already dying, the weak.But what good would they do in Utopia?Sure, the family story is that everyone on that strange, other earth will  be safe and fine from Judgement day.But I knew the virus was still there.Twenty years of more life?That's still fine.Samantha was an art student.I had realised that I'd neglected that aspect of human existence.No interest in it.I had other things to do.But maybe people in the new world needed that?I crept further still.If I was correct with my scoping, Dr. Hartnagel would already be fast asleep, alongside his wife.I'd drugged her already.I made sure to avoid the third stair towards the upper floor.Laser wire.I neared the bedroom door, and put down my bag of tricks.I needed both hands free to work on the door electronics.Clever little thing, meant to be impossible to open from the outside once all the registered occupants are inside, but I had my ways.Drifting over to the bed, I made no sound."Angel of death" is what they named me in the media.I kind of liked that description, better than my family's of "The saviour of one world, and the death of another."I was as silent as if I was floating on the floor.Although I knew no one else was near, always better to be safe than sorry.Duct tape is useful at keeping people from screaming at the horror I'm about to inflict on their lovers.Is useful at binding them so I can inflict torment.That's the last condition of Salvation.The death can't be easy.They can't know what's happening.They have to die in fear, and pain, and agony, and terror.I bring out the syringe next, the antidote to the high level sleeping tablets I placed in Ms. Hartnagel meal.A pin prick.And we can begin.Dr. Hartnagel's world will end not with a whisper.I start, to pleading and begging.Of things about important work being done before I cut off his tongue.I laugh.... you get a little bit numb after a while.His wife holds back tears.Cut.Silent pleading.Cut.Two eyes looking back at the horror.Sadness.Cut.One eye.Constrained to it's fate.It's another hour before I'm done.I push the last cut into his throat, and watch, as he coughs up the promised blood.I see a brief flash of the doctor.He falls to the ground of the new earth.And starts crying.Not the reaction everyone else has had, but whatever.I glance at the missus.Rage, hate, venom spewing in her eyes.My rules tell me to leave, but I mean, what the hell, this is my last act of Salvation.Time to  hear my fan-mail at last I guess.I rip off the duct tape, and give her time to compose her words."You," she spits at me, "do... do you know what you've done.""Yes," even though she never will.She spits back."No you don't!He was so close!So fucking close.""Close?""The cure!He was working on it!"And that is how I made one world end in two years and a change.Not with a whisper, but a cough of blood.
