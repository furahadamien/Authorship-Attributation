\>When offered one wish, you jokingly said that you want to fire proof..OK, here we go.I will tell the story exactly as it happened.I will pull no punches and give no quarter..I read this in the want ads and wondered what kind of lysdexic hiring manager they had that wrote this ad.But, a job's needed, so I went.I filled out the application and then the manager called me into his office.."Do you like fire?"he said.."It's OK" I said.."You're hired", he said..And that is how I became the proof tester at the Old Grampa Whiskey Distillery.You see, if whiskey is 50% alcohol, which is considered 100 proof, it burns.My job is to light a match and see if it's up to snuff.I miss my eyebrows, but a job's needed.
