The commander Alien turns to his number one and says "Make it so."Number one then hits the transporter beam button as they both wait patiently for the Earthling to appear on the pad.When all sounds and fuzziness from the beam of the transporter go away.An eerie silence fills the room as if it was deafening."Do you think it worked?"Whispered Number one to his captain.The Captain wanted to speak, but had no words to utter.For he was just as afraid as number two.A fellow alien he always considered a good friend.He must say something, for he was the commander of this ship.He had to muster some sort of courage.Even if it was just to show that he could lead.Then came a sound from the transporter pad.They both drew near each other with hands ready to draw there weapons."What did it say?"Number one whispered."I don't know.But it said something."The captain said as he began to slowly walk around the terminal.Then they both froze.For what they both heard next, scared them.Froze them.They had no idea what to do next.For what they both heard from the transporter pad was "Maaaaaaaaatttt Daaaaaaaaaammmmoooooooonnnnn"
