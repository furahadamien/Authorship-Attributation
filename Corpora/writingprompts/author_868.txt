Like good soldiers they did as they were told, they knew there was no time to think just do.We were up against the greatest evil there ever was, and evil so powerful that all the immortals band together to fight to win.Earth became a battle ground, few humans survived in hiding, those who werent caught and put to work in the mines created a rebellion joining us to fight this great evil.Some humans call it the darkness us immortals know its true name one so vile we are forbidden to say it.(This is all I got rn Ill see if I can add to it later ....)
