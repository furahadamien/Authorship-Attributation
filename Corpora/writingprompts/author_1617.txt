"Happy birthday buddy."Here it is again.I can hear him but I can't see him.My father's voice resonates within my ears every April 6th, my birth date.The day was April 6th 2020, I was laying on my hospital bed when my parents surprised me with this jet black and bulky VR goggles."Happy birthday!"they exclaimed.I was elated!I blew the candles on my beloved red velvet birthday cake, for the last time.Before I slipped into slumber, I remember my father strapping those VR goggles onto my head."It's for the best.See you around kiddo."Those were the last few words I heard.I was so sure I wouldn't fall asleep because it was so bulky but it was instantaneous.When I woke up I was laying on beautiful grass in some foreign land's wilderness with hazy memories.A sister from the Terra Church found me wandering through the sun lit wilderness starving, thirsty and frankly on the brink of death.She brought me back to the church where I was raised with several other orphans or as they would call us 'The Adrift'.All of us had hazy memories of our own origins.We were taught that our parents must have angered the Supreme Goddess Terra so much so that she decided to deliver divine punishment by taking away the children.Everyone agreed that if our parents were people who would commit such grave sins that angered the Goddess Terra, we were better off living without them.Marking it off as God's Mercy.Little by little as I grew the memories became more stagnant but I'll remember my father's voice, I'll never forget it.Fast forward 21 years and here I am with my party at the guild pub downing a barrel.The great sword sheathed onto my back and the many scars that decorated my muscular body proved I am a veteran adventurer.It's strange because all these years I have never been able to find my father, not in the commoner realm or the noble realm yet his voice plagues me.I consulted countless amount of high priestess to seek the truth but to no avail.Well the 'voice' only happens once a year so that's fine."Don't drink so much you idiot, we don't want a drunk swordsman baggage who could potentially hit his own teammates."Catherine, my party's priest chided while sliding a pint into her own mouth.It's my birthday treat so there was no room for retaliation on my end.Jack chuckled as he polished his bow and sharpened his arrows.Must be nice not being the target of that shitty priest's constant barrage of insults.Finishing the last drip and dropping some gold coins on the table we decided to move on."It'll be dine and dash if you took those coins Keith."Catherine habitually recited."Tsk."A usual reaction from the youngest member of our party, our boy wonder bandit.As we were leaving the pub I faintly remembered.Come to think of it I have never taken off those goggles, wait what goggles were they again?V...R...?It was as though I was swept by Dj vu.My memories immediately become really hazy whenever I am close to remembering these things.As if some sort of 'system' was trying to block it out.Then again, it seems those unattainable memories are not of high importance for now as I cannot afford to be distracted when we are about to embark on a rather dangerous rescue quest so I'll cast them aside.Dawn broke and the first ray of sunshine shone onto our feet, glistening off my steel armor leggings.I turned towards my party."Let's slay some dragons."&#x200B;
