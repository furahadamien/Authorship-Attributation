DeathFlowers
Officer Jones and Officer Smith were normal policemen.They were fine with pulling over people and dealing with the occasional hold up at a convenience store but they had never dealt with something like this.Jones didn't think they ever would again.It all started when they were sitting in their car, watching for speeders on a long straight road that the county still hadn't managed to start building speed bumps for.Across the road from them three kids came out of the woods.They looked disheveled and all had a crazy glint in their eyes.And, Smith noted with some curiosity, they were all tightly gripping sticks.Smith and Jones looked at each other, discussed it for a couple seconds, and then decided that Smith would go talk to them while Jones stayed in the car.Smith reluctantly began crossed the street to the kids, but midway one of them raised his stick.The girl screamed "You can do it Harry, come on!"Smith called out "Look Harry, I'm not sure what you're trying to do but it won't work with that stick of yours."Suddenly the boy with the raised stick screamed "Expecto Patronum!"Nothing happened.They all paused.Smith sighed.And then suddenly a stag came tearing out of the woods.It sprinted across the street and slammed into Jones using its antlers.It caught him on them and twisted its head, throwing him onto the hood of the police car, where Jones was freaking out.He kicked open the door and shot the stag repeatedly before turning towards the kids.They were sprinting back into the woods, but one paused and turned around.He screamed "Sectum Semperum" and threw his stick.It flew through the air and stuck in Jones eye.He fell to the ground screaming.Two more victims of the magic kids.
