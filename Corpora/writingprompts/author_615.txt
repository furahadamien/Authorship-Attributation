Sin-God
"Something inside me has always been there.For a long time, it was awake.Then it was forced to sleep and I forgot it even existed.Now...I feel that it's awake and stronger than ever.I can remember everything."I whispered to myself as I looked at the ruins of what had been my home for what felt like an eternity even though it was actually just for 5 years.I was unable to focus completely.It must have been because of my memories remerging and my powers reawakening.The burning fury I felt manifested itself as a raging inferno and caused my house to burn down around me."They called me el conquistador once.I wonder what they'll call me now."I said to myself as I struggled to remember the face of the woman who put an end to my villainy so many years ago.I could feel my unconscious reacting to her, filling with rage and my powers sending out waves in search of her, the strange warrior whose superhero name appears to be Mnemosyne according to both the newspaper article that reawoke my sleeping memories and my memories themselves."Mnemosyne...I'm going to find you.And when I do I'll hold you accountable for what you did to me."I promised the half of myself that sought to wring her by her neck, and then to my other, calmer half, I promised "And then...I'll use my powers to help people."___________________________________________________________________________________

Unbeknownst to the once mighty villain dubbed El Conquistador, the children of Mnemosyne had been ordered to keep an eye on him and to inform their mother if his memories somehow reawoke.Her firstborn Argus, the head of the recently fused super-intelligence apparatus that was once three separate federal agencies the NSA, the Department of Homeland Security, and the FBI had just called her and informed her that he was awake.And one of her daughters, Pele was now on her way to him.He had been Pele's husband before her mother had erased both of their memories, she regained her memories days later and swore that if her husband ever had his memories reawoken she would join him and take her mother down together for the sake of the world.Together the two of them once led a shadowy organization known as The Circle, a group dubbed an extremist group by global organizations because they fought against institutional corruption using any method possible and sought to remake the world into one wherein no one has to face starvation, or poverty, and can contribute to society from the very start instead of focusing on how to survive on a day to day basis.Mnemosyne had hated their group and modified memories of their actions from the minute she found out about their existence.Now Mnemosyne was the president of a multinational business that had dealings with every actual extremist group and funded dictatorships in exchange for business deals and global tax-cuts.The greatest hero was, in fact, the greatest villain the world had ever seen, and even now she readied herself for an inevitable confrontation between herself and her most ferocious daughter as well as her world-shakingly powerful husband.
