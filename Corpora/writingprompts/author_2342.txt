She told me to 'keep my eyes pealed' and hung up.I lost attention for a moment as i had drifted off thinking about this expression, but then remembered to blink.This long stretch of nothing was in front of me and after squinting at the horizon for a while, i started thinking maybe i missed it, and that made me sad.I remembered Cathy and how we used to take long trips.I would point out nice plants, and she would tell me which of them can kill me.I would say i still think they're nice.I missed her and could imagine if she was here with me she would have made this silence all the more quiet.I still looked ahead, conceptually pealing the lids away from my eyes, and waiting.It felt like i stood there for hours.Hours of nothing but wind and more wind.I wanted to have a sip of water but i left it in the car that got me here.I hope this doesnt take long.
