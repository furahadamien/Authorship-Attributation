"One, smoking"

The hostess glared at Charlotte for a moment, then snapped back into a forced half-smile."Right this way, ma'am"

Grabbing a menu, the hostess led Charlotte across the diner to a large open room with a single table and a single chair."Your server will be right with you" She then scurried out of the room, trying but failing to maintain her profession composure.There wasn't a need for smoking areas in this day and age, much less one so large; every smoker except Charlotte had quit or died trying.Still, the space was specifically noted in the deed as non-smoking, and had to stay that way.Through that clerical oversight, it was one of the only places Charlotte was accepted.As smoking dwindled, more and more places explicitly banned smoking.That was all fine and good, for a time she was accepted in those spaces if she simply didn't smoke.That all changed as the media began to focus on the last survivors.Charlotte tried her hardest to stay out of the spotlight, but they kept broadcasting the list across all the networks.It started on the healthy living channels and found itself spread across the national news.Before too long, she was the last Smoker.Every where she walked, she saw posters splattered with mocking images of her.Businesses across the country denied her entry, even if she hadn't smoked in weeks, because everyone knew her name and face.They didn't want to be associated with her in the slightest, in fear of losing all of their other customers.She lived in infamy, even though all she wanted was some solace.She looked up for a moment across the large, empty, dimly lit room, and saw her server smiling a genuine smile, something she hadn't seen in quite some time.
