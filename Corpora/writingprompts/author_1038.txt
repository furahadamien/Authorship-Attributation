"Oi!How are Yah?I'm Steve Irwin, and today, we're going straight to hell, to look at some of the most dangerous, and misunderstood creatures in all the cosmos!"the man said.he was dressed in khaki shorts and a matching shirt, with heavy hiking boots on his feet.he beckoned his camera crew to follow him."today, we're looking for a nasty critter.it's got eight legs, shoots ink, has giant fangs, and the ability to spin webs, swim under water, and it's one of the smartest creatures in all of hell.we're looking for, the Tarantula-Squid."the man said in his thick accent.Approaching a boiling stream, the crew were told to stop simply by a gesture from the Irwin."look, right down there, it's not what we're looking for, but isn't it beautiful!"he said, pointing at a massive creature.its fur was like fire, it's eyes were blood-red, and its claws were obsidian."right there, is a hellhound!a big, beautiful girl by the looks of it!we're gonna keep our distance, but what a treat!"Irwin said, every sentence more excited than the last."a sad thing about the hellhound, is since they've been replaced by more modern and invasive torture methods, their numbers have been on the decline.in a few years, you'll be hard pressed to find any out in the wild at all.this is why zoos and wild animal parks are so important, and why captive breeding programs are necessary to protect and supplement wild populations of endangered animals."Steve explained, his tone turning solemn.they watched the hellhound take a drink before trotting off into the volcanic and grey landscape."wow, what a great find.now, let's see if we can fone of those pesky Tarantula-Squids!"Irwin said, leading the camera crew towards the boiling stream.as they approached Steve began turning over rocks gently, and peeking under overhangs and dead trees.""Tarantula-Squid are notorious for hiding under things, and leaping out at its prey!OI!"Steve exclaimed, and he jumped back from a boulder as something leapt at him.he gracefully sidestepped the animal and flung himself down as it landed, grabbing the animal by the body only hard enough to immobilize the creature."alright!here we are, and it is a beauty!"Steve said, holding up the animal for the camera to see.the body of a tarantula, fuzzy and round, and legs of a squid, flexible and lined with suckers, and the fangs of the tarantula on either side of a great beak."this is what we've been looking for fellas!look at how gorgeous this animal is.Tarantula-Squid are what's called a Chimera, a hodgepodge of multiple animals, and these poor fellas are at risk.they like to hide under houses and in areas that they're building new torture chambers, and that puts them in contact with people and demons."Irwin explained, showing the animal to the camera, and it was shockingly calm."these guys have a pretty strong bite, and that makes folks scared of them.but what most people don't know, is that their venom is almost entirely harmless, it's just enough to kill their normal prey of bats and skeletal birds.it's not enough to do any lasting harm to a person."Irwin said, as the tentacles rapped and unwrapped around his wrist and hand curiously."we're gonna let this guy go now, and I'm gonna head on back to my new zoo, but we should remember, we have to share the cosmos with all these creatures, even the ones that gross us out a little bit."Steve said, gently setting the Tarantula-Squid down, and letting it go.the animal quickly scurried back under a rock."well, this's been a great day!I'm Steve Irwin, and until next time mates!"and Steve left frame of camera and the crew packed up and followed him.This man could see the beauty in any animal, and it was helping educate, even after death.Steve Smiled as he walked, excited to plan his next trip, and check up on his family.he missed them, but he was proud of them all.
