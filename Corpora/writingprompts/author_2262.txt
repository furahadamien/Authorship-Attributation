I like to look at the sky and think what secrets are out there, what if there is more than our home.We've lived in this galaxy for generations, keeping detailed track of every movement of our civilization; we know what happened.We know of the supergalaxy, and the universe that supposedly is out there.We managed to map a sizable chunk of the universe through wormholes and brave travelers going really far from home, leaving us with the potential of never coming back.The universe is clusters, clusters of dying stars; we're probably one of the lasts life forms to ever exist in this universe, but we were not the first.The travellers tells us tales of a very unusual solar system, one filled with metallic and plastic materials .The scientists are completely in awe, that's something that just couldn't have formed naturally, but what else could have put it there?That's one of the most remote, random places on the Jorinean supergalaxy, it had to be something that came from there.My people call them the Fyu nem, an ancient race of advanced beings; living things that controlled the stars, planets and orbits, they ruled the universe before the universe ruled them out, they escaped the imminent extinction by literally driving their planet away from their star, just enough to be safe, and managed to travel through space and outside of their own galaxy,  A few decades ago, we recovered their ship.Historians believe it's inscriptions are read as "Boyajer", but they have no idea what it means.They think it has something to do with the distance and a long, long farewell, fitting for the task of a ship like this one.This piece of information could allow us to understand better this mysterious, ancient civilization, how they made their technology and if they improved it, if we improved it from the bases they left scattered through the universe.We found detailed coordinates, information of their species, we found native music and arts, we found them.My name is Gunkkjol Ylkam,and I'm a traveller.I swear by Hunkn watching me that I will unveil the past of the people that moved planets, even if I don't like what I end up finding.
