I was the first human and the first to perish.I wasnt surrounded by any form of affection.Fully surrounded by loneliness during my last minutes on earth.I wished for a comfort that never came.I Passed alone, empty and cold.Instead of finding peace, I decided to stay in order to give what I never received.I provide the warmth you call the light.I bring forth your most cherished memories you may have forgotten over time.Your time will come eventually, you will fear me and hate me, but I will always provide you with what I was never given.
