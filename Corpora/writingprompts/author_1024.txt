After 30 year when I assisted to the fall of the Eiffel Tower, I was sit in my bunker, eating the automatic distribution Oero linked to a complex and old mechanery system.This morning was not like everyone else, I couldn't reach the food, I couldn't get up anymore.I've tried during years to make rations in order to compensate this big amount of sugar in the blood.But even with my efforts, I gained weight every year, especially the first 5 years.The last 3 years were deadly for me, the solitude was too present, I used to talk to myself but another character came from my mind, what I call the "betrayer of hope".This guy is always telling me to let it go, what kind of life is it anyway, just eat.My other imaginary friend, Charles, told me that Betrayer used me at night to eat more Oreos.I had to kill Betrayer, but I had not a single idea how to do it.Now I'm stucked, and Betrayer is whispering "get up, eat!".Charles, for once, is fighting with him, he's telling him to let me be.I'm at the dawn of a new era.I don't know if some others survived... but I guess so if him here.Charles is right, I should stay sit and die.This new world doesn't need a huge ass sponsorised by chocolate cakes.I mean, I don't even know if would be able to speak to another human being anyway.I found some strength to get up, my legs are hurting so badly (I stopped minimal sports circa 2 years ago).The machine is waiting, I grab a pack and open it.Watching my billionth Oreo, in front of me, I said loudly "you and your friends killed me a long time ago" I threw the bizkit, I took one of the chairs and broke the distribution machine.Charles and Betrayers were silent, they understood.Vital organ was lost, forever.I knew they would fight again, but it wasn't important any more, I went to the bed again, and had the force to imagine a house, my former wife and our child Paul blown in the nuclear explosion, and above all a good old steak.Started to sleep again with an honest smile, the first I had in 30 years.
