Note: I made this with the purpose of making something funny , its not supposed to be taken seriously


The horse had spikes growing all the way his spine , teeth as sharp as a lions , fire instead of a mane.It galloped around my backyard as he breathed fire on everything he went close by while I just stared at it from the door.I blinked one or more times and took some sips of my hot coffee to make sure I am not still dreaming.After making the conclusion that this sheet was real I went upstairs to my little girls room where she tightly folded herself in her pony bedsheets as she slept
With all the care and love of a father I said hey beach wake the duck up see what freaking Lucifer brought you

She immediatly stood up and looked deep into the windows of my soul , trying to figure out if I was lying or not
Na beach , I aint lying I said theres a demonic horse or some sheet on the backyard because you didnt have the skills to write Santa.Go and figure out if it bites she held a smile ear to ear as she rushed down the stairs to what could be her impending doom while I just fell asleep on her bed , sheet is comfy as truck.
