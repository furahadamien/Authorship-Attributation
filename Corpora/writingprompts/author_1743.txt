Well look who's finally here."Greg heard the voice but was too disoriented to know where it was coming from.He had a strange feeling of being enclosed in a small room but outside at night in a cold fog at the same time."You always thought you were so much better but now look at you.Whimpering like a little bitch.Isn't that what you used to call me?Snot nosed bitch?Fat ass bitch?Whiny bitch?You remember that asshole?""Stop it.Leave him alone."Greg recognized the second voice but couldn't place it either.He couldn't see anything but a thin mist."Its ok Greg.You can stand up.You can do it.Remember when you used to tell me that?You were the only one who ever tried to help.No one else ever cared.""That's cause he was gay for you.Didn't you always tell me that Greggy?Anytime I was trying to be nice, you called me a fag.Oh you're such a fag.Such a fag."Greg knew that mocking tone now, it turned his stomach but he said nothing."Did he hurt your feelings?Greg, you did a lot worse to me."Greg sat up when he heard this third voice, thin and hollow."You guys are just being mean.He only ever wanted to help.He never meant to hurt anybody.""No?That seems pretty hard to believe considering how he treated me every day.""That's a lie.He was nice to you sometimes.""Oh but what about me?Was he nice to me?Oh yeah thanks for the fentynal Greg.That helped a lot.I feel a lot better now.At least your dumbass is here too, enjoying the view.""Fucking stupid asshole.""Shut up.Stop.Just stop.I thought it'd be all over.I'm sick of you fucks.""Even me Greg?"Greg ignored the question from the meekest voice and began to weep."Didn't I do anything right?"Then a new voice drifted through the fog."Greg, if you can hear me.I just want you to know I miss you.I miss you so much.I'll never touch that shit again.I hate it for taking you away."The voice began to waiver."Why?Why did you do it?Things weren't that bad.I could've helped.I'm going to help others now.I'll miss you forever."Greg stood up and the fog began to lift.The mocking voice returned."I miss you Greggy.Fucking faggots.Too bad you couldn't help me out bitch.""Shut up.Just shut up.If I helped him that's enough.Knowing that he learned from my mistake, that's worth it.""Yeah that's great but we're here cause of your mistake, as you call it.It was no mistake.You knew exactly what would happen if you took that much.But like always, you probably blame me, mr. hollow, the easy target.""Leave him alone.He's still in such pain."Greg looked around, straining to see if there was anything to see."So this is hell.An eternity of listening to this.Isn't that why I'm here in the first place?""This isn't hell, Greg.We don't have to stay here.You used to tell me that all the time.I just never listened.I'm sorry."Greg knew what he had to do.He had always known.He had just never had the strength to do it.He began to walk.He heard his own voice, miserable and full of hate."Where are you going bitch?"Greg kept his mouth closed, step after step, just thinking goodbye.
