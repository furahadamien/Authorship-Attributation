I've always been lucky.I don't mean that in some sort of vague, intangible sense.I mean I'm protagonist lucky, the contrived kind of lucky that would make you roll your eyes and put down the book.The having a personal deus in my machina, Jesus levels of karma kind of lucky.So you're probably wondering how the hell I ended up in prison, and more than that, how the hell do they keep me here?Well, predictably, they picked me up in Vegas.Casinos are the bread and butter of people like me.A casino might as well be an ATM when you have the devil's own luck.Some of us are smart enough to try to hide it, of course.Pick less obvious games to win.On wall street the bandits have two arms, and everyone is quicker on the draw.It's easier to conflate luck and skill in a place like that.I'm not that clever.In the casinos, it's all luck, and that's how they get you.I got picked up about a week into my binge, living it up in the MGM Mansion after having arrived in town with about a hundred dollars to my name.It was stupid, I know, but like I said I'm not that clever, and I was pretty high at the time.When the world has had your back since the day you were born, you don't exactly get into the habit of being careful.Luck is a super power, especially when it's turned up to 11.People like me, we don't do responsibilities.We don't do preparation, we don't do planning, and we don't do consequences.We aren't a leaf on the wind, we are the wind, a god damned force of nature.And that really is the crux of the matter.When they picked me up, there was no fire, and no brimstone.Just a calm judiciary in a black robe explaining that people like me are too dangerous to have around.That if you could lock up a tornado or imprison an earthquake, you should.So they put me in here, with the other lucky ones.It's not too bad -- the food's alright, there's activities, and most of the people are great.I like having folks around I can relate to.Well, some of them.Half of them, to be precise.You can't really build a prison for people like us.There are no walls, no doors, no routines or mechanisms that can contend with what we've got.So they didn't try.As far as maximum security goes, this place is pretty bare bones, and that's all they need.Half the inmates here are like me, lucky as all hell.The other half, well, they're just about the most unfortunate bastards you'll ever meet.If the world bends over backward for us, it squats right down and shits all over these guys.The kind of misfortune that shapes you at your core.The world's been using them as a punching bag so long, all they can think about is striking back, and they have the criminal records to show for it.I mean that literally -- these are not the kinds of people who get away with things.Hell, with their luck, they don't even get away with stuff they didn't do.Prison isn't doing them any favors, either, especially not being trapped here with us.For every winner, there has to be at least one loser, and in this place that all works out pretty much exactly the way you'd expect.The proximity just makes it more brutal.I'd feel bad, except there's nothing I can do.If I try to do them a good turn, it cancels out.Not good, not bad, just nothing.If it goes against our nature, it just doesn't occur.And that's the key to this place.You see, it has a unique rule: If we get out, so do they.
