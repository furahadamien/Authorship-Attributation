When, Bob Ross was sent to 1910, his mission was clear - help Hitler become a painter.After 3 months of long painting sessions, Adolf was becoming a really good artist.If it continued like that, Bob would be successful, WW2 would never happen.One day, as Bob woke up in his bed, he saw another time traveller sitting in his room.Hi, Mr. Ross  said the time traveller.Bob did not answer.I have to admit, you have been quite unexpectedly successful.Not only have you thought him how to paint, but also, it seems like you have molded Hitler into a charming fellow.You should be really proud. 

Bob planned to say something, but the time traveller rudely went on speaking.You see, Mr. Ross we have run the simulations and it turns out we were quite, quite wrong.It is essential that WW2 happens. 

Bob wanted to ask why, but he was interrupted again.Bob, if Hitler does not wrestle control of the Germany.All the scientists, who have immigrated to USA in 1933, will stay happily where they are.This means that Germans will be first to develop the nuclear bomb and that is when they start the WW2, they will also be first to develop the time travelling machine, so if we dont fix this now we will never have the chance.Germans ruling the world is bad thought Bob, but what could he do, Hitler was really not that bad of a human being anymore.The time traveller continued  As I have said earlier, you were too successful.At this point you are his only friend.So, Mr. Ross future has one more favor to ask.You need to be killed painfully in front of Adolf Hitler by the group of Jews. 

Bob was expecting everything, but this.--
