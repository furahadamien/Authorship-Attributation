Hmm, and exactly 4 cloves. 

As I added the last ingredient (careful to stir once after each clove was added) I thought, not for the first time, that nana really was a strange woman.The recipe for this particular chicken noodle soup was extensive and detailed.It was the 4th such recipe for chicken soup in nanas cookbook but it was by far the most detailed.Obviously I had to try recreating it!Nana was nothing short of magically gifted in the kitchen.She was renowned in her community for being the best chef and baker around.She single handedly funded the community fire hall, after school club, and the quilters guild with her annual bake sales.Naturally I wanted to channel nanas talent and hone my cooking skills.Even if it was only for a rainy afternoon bowl of soup.As I finished my final stir and set the old wooden spoon on the stove there was a flash of lightning followed by a resounding *BOOOOOM* of thunder.At the same moment the soup came to a hard boil threatening to bubble over the top of the pot.Quickly I reached for the temperature dial and flicked it off.In my haste I didnt fully register how odd it was for the soup to boil over on a low simmer.With the heat off and the soup simmering I began my clean up as nanas recipes always left  quite the mess in the kitchen.While settling nanas cookbook back into its space on the top shelf of the panty I heard a rattle and a clatter behind me.Turning with cookbook in hand I was greeted with a puff of smoke.Ohhhh, its been a while Wait, youre not - How?How were you able to summon me?
In a state of shock and panic I could only reply with a frantic I I dont know!!You were supposed to be chicken soup!!

Standing stock still with nanas cookbook in hand I studied the demon, and the demon studied me.Immediately I knew he was a demon.Red skin, horns, a tail, he has all the tell-tale signs of a demon.But I couldnt help but notice that he had a hair net tangled in his horns, and he was wearing an apron with kiss the cook emblazoned on the front.As I stood in a state of shock I could hear a bustling in the other room as nana was coming to check on me.She entered the kitchen and in typical nana fashion she turned to me with an exasperated, ohhhh hunny!What have you been doing in here?If you wanted soup you know I could have whipped it up for you!

Confused by the happenings of the last 5 minutes I asked nana the first thing that came to mind, nana, why are you not freaking out right now?!Theres a 7 foot demon by the stove?

Nana to her credit took it in stride, Oh hunny, thats just Sebastian.Hes my kitchen demon.He and I enjoy cooking together sometimes.Hello Sebastian.

Hi Agnes.Hello to you as well, young one.Sorry about the entrance there.Usually I only get calls from Agnes.Im Sebastian, and you might say Im a demon in the kitchen."Clearly I was losing my mind.But nanas presence had a calming effect on me and I was able to stammer out an ineloquent Uh hi Sebastian?Nana Are you a fucking witch?!

Oh hunny, dont be so dramatic.Im nothing of the sort.But I am a quarter Angel and Sebastian here is an old friend from the 3rd ring of hell.We both have a fondness for cooking and baking and we do enjoy collaborating every now and then.

And without missing a beat and with a twinkle nana continued, Sweetie, why did you think everyone always says my baking simply divine?Now Sebastian now that youve met my little pumpkin why dont we whip up a quick Devils food cake to have after our soup.

And that was how I discovered nanas secret kitchen demon.
