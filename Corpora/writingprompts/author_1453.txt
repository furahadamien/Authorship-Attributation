A-La-Mode
It was 2040.The United States, most would agree, was in phenomenal shape.The economy was booming, contrary to what pundits predicted would become of President Karenna Gore's policies.The air and the water was clean.The average American was considerably healthier than just a decade ago.Nobody in the *world* even smoked tobacco anymore... save for me.Yes, I was the only human being left on the planet that smoked those cancer-sticks; and I was world famous for it.I guess that makes me an ass-hole.I thought I had a case for myself though.I mean, consider the- "Oh, well that's just great."I gazed up at the fresh billboard.It was me, with cigarettes protruding from every orifice of my face.Brutal.It gave me a sick feeling.I wasn't angry, just stressed."I need a smoke."I took out one of my beautiful hand rolled stogies.No store sold the stuff anymore.Society had turned me into a craftsman, a modern cowboy living in the city.And they knew exactly where I lived.The ads followed me around like a shadow; pleas from every health organization from A to Z; personal letters from government officials.It was non-stop.I took a much warranted drag and let out a cloud of smoke through my mouth and nose, much too conspicuously."Oh my gosh," said a woman from across the street, stopping her friend and pointing."Look!It's him!"I twiddled the stogie in my fingers and glanced casually over at them.I took another drag and headed over to them."Hey!Why don't you stop?""Yeah.Call it quits.It's not hard.""Hi ladies.My name's Eliot.""Yeah.We know who you are."I smiled and began to raise my cigarette."Whoa!Hey!""Second hand smoke!Second hand smoke!"I put my hands up in surrender."Relax."It was like I'd pulled a gun out.They were backing away.I let the cigarette to the ground and stomped it out as a sign of peace.One exhaled in relief as she had been holding her breath."I have a kid you know.""Okay."The other sighed."This might not be my place but-"

"Probably not.""-you're the last person in the entire world who smokes.You're life must be... very very hard.Why, why don't you just stop?They have amazing programs-"

"Believe me, I'm well aware."I pointed at a magazine stand, where a full row of issues sat with my face on them and the headline 'It's easy, Eliot'.She looked at the issues.She looked back, struck with a note of sympathy."It must be stressful.""Yeeah.The irony.""Well, is it worth it?""It's not just for the smoke itself, crazy as it may sound.It's like a remnant to me.A relic.Something to hold on to."They were intent now.I wouldn't admit it, but it was so nice to have this from someone besides my dog.He's a great dog, don't get me wrong, but it was no challenge getting him on my side."Clint Eastwood, James Dean- Gandalf- the French!Artists, authors with wooden pipes, and- and politicians chewing on cubans.I know things are better off now but, I miss it.I miss it all."One of them half smiled.I sure hadn't made anyone smile in a long time.That felt good.She turned to her friend."Could *one* really hurt that much?"She neared me and gestured at the tobacco box in my jacket pocket.She said, smiling fully, "light me up."
