The very first time it happened, I was brushing my teeth before bed.Toothpaste isn't the best thing to have in your mouth when you transport; I learned that straightaway.I should have been more concerned with why I had been brushing my teeth in my bathroom one minute and the next standing in my first girlfriend's bedroom, where she was struggling to finish her math homework.Instead I wondered what the side effects of swallowing too much toothpaste were.From the second time it happened, I learned several very important things: to never be doing something for very long, never drive anywhere, don't cook on stoves.Things like that.I found reading books was the best activity to indulge in, as I don't think a falling book has ever killed anyone.Every time I transported, my girlfriend learned something new about me (Though I thought it seemed rather unfair since every time I transported, I was midway through an activity, and without the context of said activity, I wound up looking like a psychopath.Transporting to her family dinner soaking wet and naked sure does kill the mood) but the more she learned about me, the more disinterested she seemed, and after three weeks of being transported to her side, she dumped me.Much to our surprise, for the first day at least, I would leave her and walk out the door, only to immediately be transported back to her side.That first day was pretty awkward.By the third week, I learned that I have a sailor's mouth.Upon transporting, I was hardly capable of anything more than an obscenity, which really got weird on Sunday mornings when a transporting teenager appears in church and screams the F-word.We've gone years now living like this, with me popping in and out of her life unexpectedly.We've become friends of a sort.There's really no other choice.We see each other every day for ten minutes or so.I show up, and with a simple nod, we work out whatever she needs doing.It somehow works for us.She told me the other day that she sometimes creates situations to bring me to her, and I'm not sure how I feel about that.Anyway, here I am.Ten years later.I know it sounds so incredibly unbelievable, but it's all true.I feel like it is a super power, but a really boring one.Really only useful to one person.That's life though, at least for me.I long for the day when I can wake up and not be called away right when I'm busy doing someth
