The horrid screeching on my nightstand yanked me out of my slumber with all the politeness of a fisherman landing a catch."Fucking amber alert," I grumbled as I reached for my phone.Squinting my eyes against the cold light, my fingers fumbled for the merciful button to silence it.With serenity embracing me once again, I wanted nothing more than to go back to sleep, but I couldn't help reading the notification just for the hell of it.I read the words on my screen.I didn't understand them.Not at first.I read it again, willing my stinging eyes to open a bit wider."DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON."The hell is this?Some sort of prank?I thought for a moment.Random miscreants couldn't just start an emergency alert on people's phones... Could they?Hell if I knew."DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON."I pressed my phone's screen into my sheets, leaving my vision pitch black, save for the silvery light leaking through the closed slits of my blinds.The moonlight.I knew it was stupid, but even still, the voice in the back of my mind was heard clear.The voice that had read all the campy sci-fi books, seen all the dumb horror movies.I knew full well that the supernatural didn't exist.And yet I allowed myself to stare into the soft light glowing through my blinds, entertaining all sorts of thoughts about what would happen, were there truly something unearthly going on.Maybe the martians were mind controlling us with the moon.Maybe the moon was gone, replaced with something else.Maybe the moon was falling.Eventually, I shook my head at the absurdity of it all.I set my phone back down on the nightstand, got comfy again under my sheets, closed my eyes, and was consumed by my own curiosity.With a groan, I gave myself an excuse, told myself that I only wanted to take my mind off it a little.But that voice in my head was just begging me to confirm it.I unlocked my phone and froze.A small chill flowed through my body.My text notifications displayed 9,999 new messages.Faster than I would have liked, I gingerly opened my texts.Hundreds, thousands of numbers I didn't recognize.Area codes ranging from all over, to the point where I suspected they were from across the world.Every one that I read, frantically scrolling through them, stated the same message."It's a beautiful night tonight.Look outside."My gaze slowly returned to the blinds.Those damned silvery trails of light."No.No.This is insane."A small panic grew in my chest, and I tossed my sheets aside, got up and out.I faced the blinds, pacing my feet in place like I was ready to run."No, no, this isn't...This isn't anything."I looked at my phone again, and realized my hands had begun to shake.I'll just check the internet, I thought.I'll learn if something real is happening.But even as I reached for the app, I stopped myself.That voice inside me preached caution.What if there were pictures?What if you opened the internet and saw a picture of the moon?I didn't know what to do.So I got dressed.Walked out of my bedroom, a small knot of worry forming in my throat.I stopped at the end of the hallway, at the entrance to my living room.The floor was saturated with the moon's light through the wide, open window on the far wall.I breathed in deeply.I closed my eyes.I listened.I didn't hear anything.I exhaled.This really is dumb.I should be asleep.I need to find out for myself.I walked forward.I felt myself stand before the window.I tilted my head up, to where the moon should be.I opened my eyes.The moon stared back.
