Ill make this quick because Im about to commit suicide, and reserve the same fate as the others.These are my last words, and I want those who are on this doomed earth to know the truth.I picked my victims wisely, and those who are reading this.You are those victims.I was cursed with this blade, set to decide the fate of who will live and who will die.I made it simple, a polite greeting, a smile, giving your seat to someone in need.Most of you failed this, and the new earth is barely populated I didnt travel much I made my rounds through the North American continent, most of Canada survived and theyre in the better place now the new earth.I tried my best to reach the rest of the planet but time held me back, I only had so much time and as the day draws nearer when I know Ill be found.I want to take my life, and be with them.With that, I leave you.Pray to your gods, and may they have mercy on your soul.The sun wakes me from my sleep, I try to love but Im stuck my body wont move I can look around but I cant speak.Im hooked up to tubes, theyre in my arms, my face my nose...whats going on.I can see people around me, lab coats, scrubs am I in a hospital?I try to scream but it doesnt work, they dont even know Im awake.One of them cover over to me and checks my vitals.His eyes are open says a man in a coat
That means it is complete, the test is over I hear a voice but cant see the owner 

I hear plugs being pulled, and my life fading a light welcomes me as I rise from my bed.I see green pastures every person Id killed to spare their life is there waiting for me.Im greeted with smiles, hugs and tears I am a hero.Or so I think...till a blade slides deep into my back, and a solitary voice coming from everyone says.We didnt ask for this





I jolt up out of bed, my dog licking my face to calm me.It was all a dream...
