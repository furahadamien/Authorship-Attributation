The-Lying-Tree
Matt sat in his cage listening to the aliens as they chattered amongst themselves."Nuqjatlh should mah pong 'oh?"A vaguely humanoid creature in a blue uniform said."jih don't sov 'ach 'oh sure is ugly" another dressed in red responded."nuqjatlh do tlhih mean?""neh look at its 'aqlo', 'oh's vaj flat.'oh's disturbing" 

"Let's neh pong 'oh 'aglo' flat vaj," 

Matt couldn't understand what they were saying but it was clear the pair was having a conversation.They both nodded, seemingly in agreement when the pair turned their attention to him."'Aglo'-flat" the red shirt said pointing at him."'Oh qo' yaj mah," the blue shirt said."Nuqjatlh do mah do vaj?"the red shirt said running a disturbingly human hand over its grotesque face.The blue-clad alien shrugged before walking off.Matt sat in his cage rather confused.He worried for the second time, that he may never return to earth.Though he didn't lose hope, because if he could survive a year and a half stuck on Mars eating nothing but shit potatoes he could survive this.****

Matt lost track of time as hours, then days passed by.He either slept or observed, unsure of what else he could do.He had gotten used to the curious stares of the aliens and found him drifting off as a group all dressed in red watched him with a curious eye.*'Maybe the colours denote rank, whenever the golden one appears they all act different'* Matt thought to himself before drifting off for the umpteenth time.***

He awoke to chaos, the lights were flashing red, a siren was blazing, and the group of red shirts were running around in a panic."qo' maj nuvs" One shouted

"qo' sov of du" another shouted in response

"'Em!"a third said pointing to an open doorway before being shot dead.This only caused the other two to panic even more, with one fumbling with a device hung from its belt before a red beam shot from its end turning the creature to dust.The third saw this and ran to the nearest door, flinging it open and was sucked out into space."Wow, that was easier than I thought it'd be," a familiar voice called."Yeah, where do you think Matt is?"Another responded.Just then a pair walked into the room.They stopped seeing Matt in his cage."Huston, this is Commander Melissa Lewis, we've got him," Melissa said into a radio."It's time to take you home," Rick said opening the cage setting Matt free.****
