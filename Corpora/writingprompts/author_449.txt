Today is the Day of reconciliation.We have been preparing for this day for the past 50 years.When we decided no more  and enough was enough.After the Third World War, we decided it was time.50 years we had.Just 50 years.50 years to clean up the mess.50 years to rebuild humanity.50 years to build peace.It all started after the Third World War ended.Elon musk united the world by proposing a new planet to be inhabited.But we couldnt all just up and leave.Like spoiled brats, leaving their mess to be cleaned by others.Yet we did understand we couldnt go on the way we had.It was Kimbal Musk that came up with the idea to honour Earth.At the global summit it was decided that every country would clean up their turf.Parameters were set for clean water, clean air, the minimum of trees that needed to be planted.The clean up of all the soil.But it soon became apparent the United States didnt play by the rules.They just dumped their garbage in the ocean, their chemical waste in other countries.So the world decided we needed time alone to sort out our mess.No contact with other countries for 50 years.It was a big decision affecting every soul on earth.5 years after the shutdown the royalty of Europe came together at the wedding of princes Alexia of the Netherlands with messages of their nations people.This was the start of the uniting treaty.We only had one earth and borders had no 
meaning for the ecosystem.We had to unite to clean up and unite to make the earth great again.So the global tax system was put in place.A 10 percent stipend on everything.One percent to clean up waste
one for clean water
One for planting greens
One for solar panels and wind turbines 
One for healthcare
One for education
One for ecofriendly industries
One for preservation of animals 
One for the conversion from gas to electricity 
And one for cleaning up the oceans.International trade and travel was suspended to reduce the impact on earth.Every market only had local products.I know it sounds like we made a jump back in time.But thats not true.We had the Internet we could contact anyone, learn anything and help wherever we could.New inventions were made everyday.And there was peace.True peace.The whole world working together to save the earth and thus save themselves.Well not the whole world.... today is the day we have been dreading.The day that the United States join the world again.
