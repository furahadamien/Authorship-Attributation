When I rose from the earth, the body stayed.I say the body, not my body, because of course its not mine anymore.Easy to argue it never was.Imagine if you can, the world consisting entirely of 4 people: your parents, your brother, and yourself.Now imagine one of them killed you because God wasnt impressed by his rutabagas.So with one swing, boom: 25% of the worlds population is dead.2.5 decimations.And God, he hasnt really nailed down what to do at this point.Thought he had time, yknow?But here I am, dead as dirt, and being tilled over by my brother.Stupidest thing?I wondered who was going to watch my sheep.I hoped Mom would take them, she always had the more subtle hand.Subtle thing, shepherding.So Im buried in the field, earth drinking up my blood, and I hear this awful racket.Apparently God found what Cain was up to, and let me tell you: OT God?Not your peace be with you sort of guy.Young still.Hadnt calmed down yet.So Cain is sent to Nod, a little eastways of here, with Gods promise that hell never die, so his pain would be unending (did I mention the wrath?).And after a while, God helps me up, and the body stays.Says I came from clay, so its okay to go back to it.I shrug, because its God, what.Youre gonna argue?So I say to God what now?And God just sort of does this half shrug, half sigh thing, and gestures at the empty world outside of Eden.God says Hes got a lot of work to do.Says itll take time to get Heaven ready for people.Hells got its own contractors on the job, so thats good.He says Im the first.Im the only.Four was bad enough.Now its one.I ask about my sheep, and God just shakes his head.I ask about my goats, and sure enough, same thing.So I ask about the next one.God says, The next one what?  And I said, Person.And here we are.

Abel sits back, seemingly well rehearsed in this story.So yeah, great work with the kids.You even managed to save some before the bomb went off.I already walked the kids in.Your turn!

As Abel and the young teacher stand and prepare to march off, the teacher freezes.Shakily, a hand lifts to point in the distance.Abel squints, and sees the Grim Reaper.He pats her shoulder, chuckling gently and tucking his shepherds crook into his elbow.I told you.Youre Good!Like, capital G Good.Heavenbound.  At the questioning look, Abel just shrugs.Well, you remember my brother?God cursed him to wander, and wont let him die.Doesnt mean He wont put him to work.So yeah, hes just skull and bones now, and he wears that ridiculous hood.Still carries around that stupid scythe from his farming days.But dont stress, hes not here for you: hes here for the bomber.

Abel shudders, before moving on.Man, you do not want to be that bomber right now.Did I mention the wrath?
