I'm walking through the woods with my metal detector.My bag of found odds and ends clinking away.I usually go out places looking for things to sell to supplement my living costs as I can't hold down a real job.It also helps pay for my medication.The detector goes nuts so I put it down and pull out my little shovel and start digging.It hits something big on the first hit.I dig the object up carefully in case it's a bomb or other explosive.It's a large Bowie knife.In almost perfect condition.I'm excited as it might be worth something but that stops when I grasp it.The blade starts talking to me.*You must use me.The world is coming to an end soon.War, death and pain everywhere.* I look at the blade and I completely understand.I place the knife in my bag and walk back to the road.I pull out my cellphone and call my mother to tell her I'm done for the day.I wait 15 minutes for her to get there.I open the passenger door and set my bag down on the floor boards and sit in the seat.As I close the door and buckle up she smiles at me and says "Did you find anything good sweetie?"I look at her and smile."Not really but I had a lot of fun."I say.She starts driving and says "Maybe next time sweetie but at least you had fun.Are you hungry?"I look ahead at the town and say happily "Yeah can we get McDonald's?"She say's "Yeah what do you want?"I think a little bit and respond "Can I have a double cheeseburger?"She smiles and drives to McDonald's.**30 minutes later.** I sit at home in my room with my knife on my dresser.My mom knocks on my door and says "Sweetheart it's time to take your night meds."I get up and open the door.She hands me my meds and walks away.I go to take my meds but I stop.*Don't take them.We need you awake for the task ahead.* I set the meds on my dresser and grasp the blade."But how will using you save people from the pain?"I ask out loud to the blade.*It will send them to another universe that is free from the fate I have told you about.* I look at the blade."Alright."I go out to the living room and look at my mom."Hey sweetie what are yo-" she stares at the blade in my hand.Terrified."Sweetheart.Put the knife down."she stands up and walks slowly towards me reaching out."I'm sorry mom.I have to."I say before I quickly rush at her slamming the knife into her throat so hard that I hear the vertebrae in her neck shatter.A single year drops down my face as I grab her limp corpse and set her down gently."I'm so sorry mom but you'll thank me.I love you."I whisper as I close her eyes.I pull the knife blade out gently and wipe the blood off on the carpet.*Now we must get to work.You have to save as many people as possible.* I put the knife in the waist band of my jeans and walk to my room.I open my dresser drawer and grab my key.I make my way out to the backyard and open the shed doors.I unlock the hatch to the upstairs.I climb the pull down ladder up to the top floor.I pull the chain and the lights flicker on.My old hiding spot.Still stocked up.I walk over to the desk and pick up the Mossberg 590 Shockwave and pull the pump on it.Still looks like it works but I need to make sure.**1 hour 26 minutes later.** I finally have everything packed in the car and ready to go.I start the engine and make my way to the middle of town with the blade in the passenger seat.*You are the chosen one.The ones that die by your hands shall be saved from the painful death that awaits everyone else.* I smile to myself.I drive into town and stop in an alley to hide my bags by a dumpster before pulling the car into a parking space in front of the courthouse.I get out and put my hands in the pockets of my coat feeling the remote.I lock the car door and walk away.I make it back to the alley and open the bags.I take off my coat revealing a full military style bullet proof vest equipped with spare magazines.I pull out the Mossberg and pull the sling over my head so the gun rests at my side.I pull out the DB308 and the remote from my discarded coat.I press the button on the remote and am pleased with the loud explosion I hear 3 seconds later.I hear people screaming but I also hear the praise of the ones I just saved.I walk out into the street and start firing indiscriminately at people running towards to explosion.Then I reload and focus my gun on the people staring in a group dumb founded by what is happening.If only they knew that I was saving them, then this wouldn't be so hard.After the streets are clear of people I set my sights on the library.It will be nice to have some intellectuals on the new planet.I walk up to the door and see a horrified man in his early 20's trying to lock the doors.I raise the rifle and pull the trigger.He falls to the ground.Another one saved.*Yes keep going.* I walk through the doors but am immediately greeted with a Glock 17 pointed directly at me.The woman behind the gun opens fire and empties her magazine hitting me twice.Once in the arm forcing me to drop my rifle and once in my thigh sending me to the ground with my gun.I can feel death creeping towards me.*No not like this.You can't die like this.* I tear at the shotgun strap trying to release it.Finally it breaks and I can pull the barrel under my chin."I'll be with you my chosen few."I say before pulling the trigger.*Police are saying the mass murder yesterday was the action of one man.*

*30 year old Jeffrey Marcotte is responsible for the deaths of over 60 people including his mother yesterday.*

*Marcotte is said to have been a schizophrenic man.*

*Marcotte's psychologist has stated that he was put on a new medication shortly before this spree and that the change in his medication may be to blame.*
