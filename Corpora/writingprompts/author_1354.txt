Zulth had believed in humans for as long as he could remember.Theories of them had been around for decades, of course, but only with recent advances in radio telescopes had their existence been all but proved.The first patterns came through just fifty solar cycles ago.26 unique patterns.A codex?A language?A password?Scholars had puzzled over the patterns for decades.Some argued that they were simply binary stars in eccentric orbits, but these held little weight when the repetition of the pattern continued unabated with no error or eccentricity.Then, thirty years, a breakthrough.A message, left overnight in rural Rhiuuth, in the middle of a large, flat tors field.The symbols meant nothing by themselves, and could have been explained by local pranksters.But soon other, similar but definably different messages appeared across the globe.That, as we say, was all there needed to be.Soon the patterns became linked to the shapes and a language was born.A method of communication.The problem; the truly infuriating thing; the thing that really, really frustrates the minds, is that we are still not advanced enough to send up our own response.Where would we even send it to?And how long would it take to arrive?Would this mega species still exist?Would they still care.Well, yes.They would.And we can prove it.Just 5 short solar cycles ago a message came through, as if answering our cries of impatience with omnipotent clarity.The message is repeated hourly, and has permeated our culture.It drives us.It helps us retain our ambition and our scope.We repeat it as a mantra, hourly.A planetary obsession, if you will.We know they will wait for us.They have told us as much.For they tell us, and we tell ourselves;

Never gonna give you up.Never gonna let you down...
