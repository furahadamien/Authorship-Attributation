Complete utter darkness surrounds me.I'm still clutching the hellish, cold, dagger.The one I've used to slay countless.They begged for murder.Why me?Why am I the one that must end the lives of women and children and mankind.I always wondered where my path might lead me.I guess to hell.I know any minute I'll be spit unto a vast and eager world I know nothing of.Only that I am their savior.I have died and resurrected anew."Aghhhhhhhh!"I scream with agony.I feel I might explode.Energy coursing through my body and then pure ecstasy envelopes me.As I open my eyes and tears fall from my cheeks, I can see a light in the distance.No, it's an angel.An angel without a face.Thud!I'm on a cold cement floor.They've been waiting for my, grand, entrance."Theo!"I can't see who is speaking but the voice is very familiar."RISE!"The figure in the distance growls."You are divine and yet you look like shite.Come here brother!""Trent!"I say relieved."I can't see you.""Your vision will soon come again.The people have been patient."Trent grabs my hand and leads me outside.I can hear a thunderous roar of applause and cheers.My name is chanted unanimously."Everyone is grateful Theo.What u did took a lot.I know your soul will be restless and your mind will ache, but there is something I must show you."Trent nervously whispers in my ear.I've come to find that I've sent everyone including myself to a dark and devastating world.A world without the internet.
