The lost one awoke with a start.The ceaseless uniform void of black that its eyes were met with failed to alleviate its confusion.It heard no sounds, sensed no presence, felt naught but a gnawing chill at every surface of its exposed skin.It tensed its throat to speak, to voice the growing torrent of emotions bubbling in its mind.It stretched its arms in front, desperate to touch another form.It was afraid.It did not know how much time passed when it first saw the white shape that danced in its frame of view.This crystalline spidery shape hovering at eye level jutted and swayed slowly toward it, but it did not run.It rubbed its eyes and walked toward the shape.A hand of bone.It noticed a black cloud above the hand, almost invisible against the inky ineffable backdrop that surrounded it.The cloud fluttered and twisted, tendrils of black nothing, forming and disappearing at random.*A cloak* it thought and, it felt a small sense of pride in its discovery.It stared up and up the cloak and its eyes met the gaze of a skull.The skull, cocked at a slight angle, was peering down at it.The surface was porcelain smooth and even beautiful, it admitted to itself.Apart from the skull and hand, nothing was visible save for the pulsing, ever-changing form of the cloak connecting the two.The skull continued to stare at it.And then the figure slowly turned around and began lumbering away, down the path from whence the skeletal host had first arrived.It took some tentative steps toward the figure but the figure did not break stride.It hastened to the figures side and attempted to keep pace to which it noticed the figure slowing their gait.Step after step, it walked with the hand hovering rhythmically by its side.It stretched a hand out and held the smallest finger of its ivory companion and the figure did not retract.And on they walked, one by the other, into the dark.
