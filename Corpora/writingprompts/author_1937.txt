Well, that was unexpected."What was that thing?"He replies almost nonchalantly, "Some alien.I am an agent of the United Nations.You understand that I have to take you in now, right?"He seems sincere, and as if he doesn't actually want to take me in, but rather just has to do it."Would it matter if I said no?"He seems amused, "Well, no.Not really.I am taking you in whether you want to go or not."Well, might as well.He led me over to his car, and gestured that I should get in.I did, and off we went, speeding into the night.Well, it's not of a decent length, but I think I am going to continue this in the morning.If anyone wants to leave an idea, please do.It helps me brainstorm.
