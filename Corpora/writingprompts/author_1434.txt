The fledgling priest stared at the scrolls that were just laid in front of him."What are these?More historical documents that I need to study?"The Bishop, wrinkled with age, lifted his hands to adjust his glasses."Those are the forbidden gospels.Scholars of old deemed them inappropriate for the masses, but the church still wanted to keep them as historical records."The priest looked up at the old man."You're kidding, right?Are you telling me that we have been hiding doctrine from the parish?That in itself seems like a sin, as we are hiding the words of God...Isn't all scripture God-breathed and useful for teaching, as stated by Paul in his letter to Timothy?The Bishop nodded, "You are correct, but this... is a bit different."The old bishop lifted the scroll again."Here, you are getting into the position in which you can decide for yourself as to whether or not you share these with your own parish."The priest slowly unrolled the ancient scrolls."What is this writing...?Greek?Latin?I can't make it out..."

The Bishop let out a sigh."No, those are just scribbles of a drunk man.We think he was trying to doodle a beast or something about the end times...  As you can see at the bottom there, the line just kind of trails off, as if he fell asleep from the booze."The priest furrowed his brow."This is all some horrible joke."The Bishop shook his head."I wish it was... but what sits in front of you is the book of Chad.Keep opening the scroll.Eventually, you will get to the greek text, written by Chad himself.Read it, translate it, and tell me what you think."The priest began to read from the scroll and translated it into English as he went along.*"The Book of Chad, Chapter one.-  On a particular day, my brother Brad and myself-"*

The Bishop held up his hand."Hold it...It isn't 'brother'.The word is actually close buddy, or *bro*.The priest blinked in protest...  "Alright then.*On a particular day, my bro Brad and myself were wicked thirsty.We were in serious need of some 'Nectar of the gods' and needed some shade too.We came across a wedding.Not knowing anyone, we crashed it and quickly became the life of the party.The thing about parties, though, is eventually the booze runs dry.That is when it is time to move on and sleep it off until the next party to crash.But lo, a simple man, the son of a carpenter was also there, with his Mom.She complained that we drank all the wine, and asked the man named Jesus to do something about it.Expecting a fight, we braced ourselves, but instead, the man filled some jugs with water and blessed them.We thought the man was a nut, but some of the damnedest best wine started flowing from them jugs.We were impressed beyond belief, and there we realized we could get all the free booze we wanted if we followed this man around."*

The priest sat there, unsure of what he just read."So... these gospels were written by men constantly plastered?"The bishop nodded."That is precisely why we can't share them.Being a drunkard is a sin."The priest sat back in thought."Yes...But Jesus came to seek and save the lost..."

The Bishop looked at the man."I am getting up in age, and as I said earlier, you are coming into a position in which you can do what you want."The priest smiled."I have a friend in Ireland who is a priest, he may benefit from these."------------------
