It all went by so fast, I was in the bank, doing my regular routine.When suddenly a robbery started, I was so scared, there was a gun shoved on mine and others faces.Suddenly I noticed there was a large black line of spiders, but that's not it; they came down and ravages the robbers!I and others stood up watching the insects bite down on them."Who are you?!"One of them asked in agony."I'm..." I mumbled."I'm the spider god"
