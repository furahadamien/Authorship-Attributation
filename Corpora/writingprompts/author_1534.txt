Dear Elizabeth,
They said that I could write one letter that they would send for me.But I know they are lying.This will never see the light of day.So I'll just tell you what I always wished I had.I love you.There is no one else I think about when I wake up in the morning, nor anyone that I keep going for.I think about never seeing you again and I weep.But I know that as long as i deliver on their one holy night - the anniversary of their saviors liberation - I will live long after you and your children have grown and passed.These creatures are fowl.They keep me up for hours on end doing training drills for the big day and I'm ready to snap.Sometimes I just want to jump out of the sleigh... but there are people who count on me.I like to think that every December 25 hou wake up and think of me.You think about the joy that I can still bring to you and your family and you rest easy.Maybe something good can come from this prison after all.Sincerely, 
Chris Kringle
