197 Billion cycles since the creation of the universe.**

Today is an exciting day, we have began receiving communications from a new light spectrum we have never observed before.It is a fairly primitive communication method, but sounds and images are pouring in now.Initial calculations seem to indicate these came from a region of space that we have yet to explore, and are about 188 billion cycles old.From all observations of the known universe that means this planet had intelligent life almost 20 billion cycles sooner than any previous estimate in the universe.**Year 17,345 (approximately 6,451 cycles) of Sentient Life:  Day 231

Initial translations name this planet Terra or Earth.They seem to be a bi-pedal species that had developed some limited solar travel, and was on a small water dominant planet about 19,0000 cycles from their galactic core moving at the speed of light.Calculations have begun about using warp technology to investigate this planet.I am in contention to be a member of the science team.**Year 17,350 (approximately 6,452 cycles) of Sentient Life:  Day 11

We have made 16 jumps and are now approaching Earth.I was placed in charge of the science team, which means I'm 3rd in command of this mission over all.The diplomacy team of course is first, and Xiera is the lead of the defense force, making her second in charge.Our goal is to observe this planet and see if life is still abundant, as well as if the humans have left any data we can collect.**Year 17,353 (approximately 6,452 cycles) of Sentient Life:  Day 412

The black dwarf that was once their star helped us find their planet.Long since stripped of any life or atmosphere, the Earth remains.Initial scans of the planet's surface left no evidence of any structures.Deep core scans have revealed that some large storage was created and injected under the crust of the planet.After some drilling, we were able to access the datacore.We have no way of interfacing with it as their technology is so alien.After additional drilling it was possible to extract the entire unit.We are now en route to home, and our top technologists are trying to bridge the gap between our tech and theirs.This planet held life, and had a star that died out, blew up, and then fizzled away long before our planet even held the beginnings of life.We may never know their secrets, but we will continue to gather their signals, and hopefully learn lessons about the history of the universe.Edit: Fixed a word
