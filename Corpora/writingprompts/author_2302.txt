"Hi, what's your name?"I looked around, I was not familiar with my surroundings.It looked like a child's room, but I didn't recognize WHO'S child it was.There was a little girl sitting at a small table with a tea set.On her left was a teddy bear, and on her right was a stuffed rabbit that looked a little worse for wear.She pointed at the seat across from her, which was surprisingly empty."Um, Hi...I'm...  " I thought for a moment, was I Robert, or Mr. Robert, or Mr. Anderson.I wasn't sure how to answer.I wasn't sure why, or how I was HERE more importantly.There was something.Something I couldn't remember yet.It was on the cusp of my memory, but just outside, like when you cannot remember a person's name whom you've known for a long time."I'm Mr. Robert, or Robert, if you like".She looked at me for a moment, thinking about what I had said."Okay, Mr. Robert.Since you are older after all.I should probably call you Mister.I'm Ashley and I am six years old."When she said six, she held up six fingers, like either I needed to see it, or perhaps she was proud of being on more than one hand in age."Would you join me for tea?""Tea?You wouldn't happen to have coffee in any of those cups would you?"I think a cup of coffee might do me some good with my memory."Coffee's gross!YUK!"Ashley squealed."Sit down and have some tea, I know you'll love it!"I sat in the chair that initially looked very small, but when I sat down, I fit in it like I was one of the stuffed animals."Sugar and Milk for your tea Mr.Robert?", she asked as she poured "tea" into my cup."Um, 2 sugars and some milk please."She pantomimed putting milk and sugar in my cup, and stirred it with a spoon."Go ahead an drink", she exclaimed.I put the tea cup to my lips, expecting air, and WOAH, there was tea with milk and sugar going into my mouth, although I did not see it IN the cup.Well, this was just weird."It's delicious!", I didn't have to pretend that part, it was really good tea.Ashley giggled in her chair as she "drank" her tea."ASHLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!"The sound of her name made her jump a little bit."Yes I'm here" she said looking a little nervous."GET DOWN HERE....NOW!!!!", the voice boomed like it was being pumped through PA system."Don't worry, they can't see you or hurt you, Okay?"she whispered to me.I wasn't sure why she was speaking so softly.She looked genuinely nervous, or scared."Oh I'm not scared."I stood up from the chair resuming my "regular" height as compared to a 6 year old.She ran to the door and opened it and I followed.The house was a normal looking ranch house that I still did not recognize.I still had no idea why I was here, either."ASHLEY!Why are't you HERE now???""I'm coming.", she turned to look at me and held her finger to her lips in the universal sign for 'hush'.We walked into the living room.Her parents were sitting on the couch with TV trays in front of them.There was a third tray with a meal on it in front of a child sized chair.I looked at the food on her tray.Chicken nuggets and carrots.looked like milk in a cup to drink.As she sat down, she accidently knocked over her milk.as it started to top, I grabbed it, and only a drop spilled.The odd thing was her parents did not react to my being there in general, but when I saved the milk, they both paled."Be careful, Ashley," her mom said with a wild look in her eyes."I will, Thank you Mr. Robert, I'll take that milk now".I didn't realize I was still holding the milk, and I handed it to Ashley."Ashley, who is Mr.Robert?""He's my new friend Mommy!He had tea with me this afternoon!""He DID?where did he come from?"Ashley shrugged her shoulders."I don't know.I do know he was a great guest at my tea party, and when he goes on, he's going to be very happy.Not like Mr. Lambert who was her last week.""Are you sure Mr. Lambert is gone?"the dad said slowly."Yes Daddy.He was not nice, was he?""No, he was not."I walked over to the other side of the room to see the parents better and noticed a bruise on the cheek of her father.I reached for the front door."You don't want to go out there yet."Ashley said very cautiously.It's not time.You have to wait.We'll have more tea, then it will be time.You've done really well with this part of the test.I believe you will have a very fun afterlife."Ashley grew older in front of me over a matter of seconds, I saw her parents get older and the room changed,  "I believe it's time for you to move on."she said as she rubbed her pregnant belly."Honey, get the car, it's time!"she said as I felt a pulling motion I was shrinking and becoming light which zoomed into her belly.&#x200B;

Now it is dark, I'm scared, I don't know what's happening, but I feel like I am trapped.What is going to happen?
