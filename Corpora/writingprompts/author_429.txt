No one know why.Or how.But they knew where; here, Home.Or what remained.A crippled nation, shriveled into isolation by a mixture of fear and disgust over their own actions.Perhaps society was recklessly distraught; not one individual left without trauma; and thought it better to die than to endure another war.But a many few survived.And with survival, naturally comes hope.But it was hard.So hard it was made to be the largest evolutionary bottleneck in human history, save one, which crafted this hope in the first place.That hope burned, smelted by the fires of hardship that stripped away impurities left behind by the people's forefathers.A steel was made that was more pure and sharp than had ever been seen.Armed with this steel, the people combined with it knowledge of the past and a clear vision of their future.They forged a new constitution, like the people before them did, the people before that, and the people before that.Knowledge upon knowledge paired with a bitter, seeping reminder of what they hoped never to near again.And so walked forth from the ashes was a new era of mankind.Not perfect, but better.Built upon the last age, and learning for the next one.But something was different.They were ready to walk among the stars.They did not call themselves American.Or Chinese.Or British.Or Russian.Or Australian.Or Sudanese.They did not call themselves by their Home.They called themselves for who they were.They were the Terrans.And the name *stuck*.
