Human.I do not know how to tell you this, but I'll put it in terms you may understand.You know how you humans say "cats have nine lives"?Well, dogs live forever.We come through different lives and bodies, like the cats.However, we are always dogs or wolves.I am here to give you a run down of my life.First, I would like to tell you a story, taught to all dogs as pups.In the days after creation; when there was no day or night, only twilight: humans and wolves lived in coexistence, two children were born in one day.This isn't abnormal today, but in those days, not many people were alive, and thus not many being born.A wolf girl, and a human boy.The girl, named Kula, and the boy named Dabo.The wolf priestess took it as a sign from the human sun god Ts'eyahi , and the wolf  moon goddess Ch'erek'a, that they were bound to be together forever.Kula and Dabo were raised together, their families had arranged them to be married when they were older.Such things were accepted in those early days.One time, when they had gotten to be older; Kula and Dabo were playing together in the forest.You see, in those days, many horrid things lived in the mists beyond the village.Things that defied logic, space and time.As they played, one such thing preyed on them.Kula saw it first.She knew what she had to do to protect her best friend.She leaped at the neck of the beast, and tore out it out.In honor of that first act of bravery, wolves now kill their prey by going for the neck.Years later, when they had grown up, a human woman named hi,  contested for the affection of Dabo.hi pleaded and prayed and still she didn't get the affection of Dabo.After a while summer if rejection, hi was twisted, and depraved.She knew what she would have to do, if she wanted Dabo.One day, she slipped hemlock into a cup of  water, and gave it to Kula, who was thirsty from being out in the hunting party.Kula got sick, and Dabo tended to her every need while Kula was laid low.This display made hi furious, and she found another way.She was helping to build a stone hut, for a family member, when she caught sight of Kula and Dabo.She knew then, how she would end her once and for all.hi told Kula that she needed to speak to her in private.The two went outside of the town, into the forest.hi took a masonry stone, and tried to smash Kula's  head in.However, after the first blow, a giant wolf appeared to fall from the sky."You will stand down from my children!"Said a pearl white wolf, with a voice somewhere between a growl and a blood curdling scream.It was the lunar wolf goddess.hi tried to run, but the giant wolf smacked hi  down with her paw.Kula hid under the Ch'erek'a, and hi fell to the ground and began to sob.


"Me and Ts'eyahi did not give either of you the right to cause harm to each other!You have no power... No right to harm each other!Now, we will have to reconsider things."The Ch'erek'a healed Kula's head, and went on."You are coming with me, while I speak with the human god."The wolf goddess took hi to yewishawibtemenigiitiwehinbti,  the prison in Ch'erek'a's palace on the moon, where the angelic servants of Ch'erek'a, kept her as a prisoner.Ch'erek'a's servants did this until Ch'erek'a and  Ts'eyahi came to a consensus on what the future would be.After many lifetimes of debate, they came to several conclusions about the future.It was determined that humans and wolves were both flawed, and need to be separated.Humans would embody the day, knowledge, and wickedness.Wolves would embody night, justice, wilderness, and temperance between peace and violence.It was determined that all living things from there on out, would die.It was determined that wolves and humans, and thus day and night, would  be separated for 90,000 years.Ts'eyahi sentenced hi to be devoured by Ch'erek'a.Ch'erek'a's stomach being the realm of umhlabawokubolakunyenexhala, or as you humans would know it, hell itself.It was determined that Ch'erek'a would handle   afterlife justice, devouring any  who were cruel in life, and permitting the kind to dwell in ilizwelothandonoxolophakathikwazozonkeizinto , or as you humans would know it, paradise.Ts'eyahi would be responsible for keeping life on Earth, by harnessing the sun and water.And finally, a new race would be created, to bind man and wolf.A race of pure light, taking the knowledge of man, the justice of wolves, and the goodness that both races had been intended to have.That is what I am.That is dog.Now, that I have told you of our past, owner.Now it is time for my story.I was a servant of Ch'erek'a.I was created to do her will.One day, I was told that I was to go down to earth as a dog, to help bring in ixeshaelitshanelingunaphakadelokuphelela, or as you would say, the new and eternal age of perfection.Owner, after I am done here, I will return to Ch'erek'a's palace.Soon, man and wolf will no longer be separated, and things will be perfect.Ch'erek'a and Ts'eyahi will come down to stay on Earth, and you and I will be together forever.Dogs will govern all things from that day on, and I will treat you, just as you treated me, as a loving companion who will live with me, as I rule, forever.
