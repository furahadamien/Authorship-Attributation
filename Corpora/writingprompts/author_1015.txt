I used to think I was the luckiest person in the world.When I was 7 I entered my name in a contest and won a lifetime supply of Oreos.There's nothing more incredible at that age to think you would be getting a free package of cookies once a month for the rest of your life.10 years later, my luck continued.My family was one of the few that survived the bombs to crawl out of the rubble of our home.Times were tough for everyone then of course.Uncontaminated food was scarse.The first month afterwards my luck continued as my package of cookies dropped down next to me right on time.I guess there's an automated factory and drone delivery system or something, but honestly I didn't really question it that much.The nutrition value of Oreos is low but when food is short you're grateful for anything you can get.As the years passed, the Oreos continued to be a lifesaver.Both for eating directly, and also for trading with those that had better food and wanted to remember what things were like before.Eventually the army showed up, under orders from the president, to "bring order back to the nation".The "president", wasn't of course the president when the bombs fell.I doubt he was even in the line of succession and most definitely hadn't been voted in.Regardless of how he entered office, it soon became pretty obvious that he was just a warlord, using the title to give his rule the veneer of legitimacy.As luck would have it, the man loves Oreos, is completely addicted to them.On learning this I assumed I could trade my package to him each month for all the food, water and supplies I wanted.I figured he could never hurt me because like the Goose that Lays the Golden Eggs, if I die the Oreo packages stop coming.How wrong I was.Sometimes I dream about before I was a "guest" of the president.Back when I could still walk, talk, or even see.See the problem with a lifetime supply of Oreos, is that I only need to be *alive* for them to arrive, and the president continues to do everything he can to guarantee I stay alive for a long, long time.
