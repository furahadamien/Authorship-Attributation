I walked down the overgrown, muddy street in my village.It was quiet, as it always had been.The quietness is the thing that was typical of this village, it had always been this quiet.I walked into the house where I was born, or at least: the place where I remembered I first was.I don't remember much of my childhood, the only thing is that I was always alone, completely alone.Luckily, in this house there were some books I could read.Books that taught me reading, books that taught me the world.Those books also taught me that I should have some parents, because people come out of a female, who has had sexual intercourse with a man.I don't know where they are, I've never seen them.The only thing I remember was that I have always had a cigarette in my mouth.I walked into the kitchen.There wasn't food there, but there were plants all over the place.Nature has not only taken this kitchen back, but this whole village.Some plants gave food, there were some berry bushes in the corner.I ate some of them.On the kitchen table sat something that has fascinated and scared me my whole life.Two objects of which I didn't know what it was or what it could've been.It seemed like some sort of skeletons, the type of animal I was, homo sapiens.Before them, on the table laid a closed package of cigarettes: the skeletons probably had never smoked them, not even one.I took the package, set one sigaret afire and put it in my mouth.I wouldn't know how to live a life in which I couldn't smoke.I walked out of the house, further down the road.I came at a junction, where a giant board was standing.On it was a picture of an old man with an angry face.I had never seen that man.I never saw men anymore, nor women.Next to the men stood the words.The words that I first taught myself: "Quit smoking!".In protest, I took a pull of my cigarette.Edit: sigaret to cigarette
