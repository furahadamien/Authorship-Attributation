Odd-Richard
I walked into a strange area.It looked somewhat like the theaters nobles when to.But this was much larger.There had to be thousands of people in the seat.And there was a large piece of parchment with moving pictures."What the hell..." I said aloud as I reached the front."It's called a cinema" answered a man who looked like a knight."Here, you're 2 seats down from me, next to that young woman."I sat down slowly, confused, when all of sudden the young lady turned to face me.She was... crying?"Oh kain!"She cried out as she reached out and hugged me."Katherine calm yourself!"demanded the knight, "Allow me to apologize.You were her first viewing and due to her status a princess, she was shocked to witness your humble beginnings as a peasant and as you rose up the latter but never lost your kindness, she began to fall in love with you.""Viewing?"I questioned."Ah yes" he said "As I recall you're  #6027.""What are you talking about?Where are we?What the do you even mean by viewing?"I screamed.The knight chuckled "Watch the screen and find out.I sighed and reluctantly looked at the screen.As I watched it all started to make sense.Fast forward 800 years.We've reached the me in the 21st century.He's a pretty good guy.Smart too.Although #6028 doesn't like him at all.Says he's not cruel enough.Although I don't bother myself was his opinion.6028 (otherwise known as arther) grew up a spoiled noble and never learned the value of kindness even after 800 years.The guys a major prick.However, me a Katherine are doing ok.I know the idea of dating yourself sounds weird but she did know me pretty intimately and well, when you're in a theater for all eternity it's nice to have someone to spend your time with."Ah looks like Niels time is up" I said."Too bad" Katherine pouted, "I really liked him!He reminded me of you honey!""Good riddance" spat Arthur "He was such a pansy!"Well time to move on to the next me.The screen started back up again."Hey does anyone remember what year it is?"I yelled to the various me's."It's 2041 A.D., can't you keep track of the time?"yelled Brutus."Hey fuck you brutus at least Kain doesn't stab his friends in the back!"shouted Katherine.I chuckled but then all our fun was cut short by a booming laugh from the back of the theater.It was #1.This was a shock to everyone considering #1 never talked to anyone."I've been so bored all these billions of years"  he said "but FINALLY something interesting is happening!"Everyone seemed to be deeply disturbed due to 1's outburst.I decided to speak out "What do you mean 1?""Hahaha can't you feel it Kain?It's finally happening!This is the last one."1 declared."Last one?What do you mean?"I asked.1 yelled out for everyone to hear "Rejoice for all of us will finally be united!This is the last cycle!This... is the end of the world."This is the first time I've ever done this so tell me what you guys think.
