For centuries, philosophers and thinkers from around the world worked in secret to develop some means of combating Death.From the rumours that leaked, most simply assumed that they were hard at work seeking to increase longevity.However, this was not death with a lowercase *d*.It was Death himself.On the eve that Death died, all was quiet.In a bed, sitting in a dimly lit room, rested the bait.Her shallow breaths rang like a death knell.Death was coming.A long, spindly appendage reached through the room unseen.It grasped and probed for any sign of near-unlife.It quickly found what it was looking for and began its attempt at devouring the dying woman's essence.That was when the trap was sprung.The woman was already dead.Her shallow breaths a ruse created through primitive life support systems.The appendage began to withdraw, but it was too late.A spectral assassin had already latched on.In all the years of research, the major breakthrough came upon the discovery that ghosts were not echoes of the past or spirits who had not yet passed on.They were in fact souls that had escaped the devouring essence of Death's touch.The Void was black and endless.But spectral assassin could see it.A caricature of Earth, floating in the vast nothing.Above it drifted a horrible and deformed fetus with billions upon billions of tendrils writhing upon the surface of the Earth.As the eye of the fetus opened, the spectral assassin willed its way toward it."I am the wind that blows.I am the precipice of the apocalypse.I am new life and I am decay."rasped the fetus.The spectral assassin slashed at the throat of the fetus, spilling essence that dissipated instantly.The fetus gurgled and then laughed."You can kill me."it managed."But I am young and my kind much older.They will come and soon all life will be extinguished."As the tendrils of Death began to disintegrate, Death flicked his fetal wrist and the spectral assassin was destroyed in a blinding flash of blue light.On Earth, man immediately felt the power of immortality.Unlimited by the ravages of time or death, the millions of years it took for man to reach all corners of the galaxy became mere moments to them.But in the dark corners of the Void, Death was coming.
