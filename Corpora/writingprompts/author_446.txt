Fifty years is a long time.Love and life is born, lives, and dies in that time span.Memory fades.Still, every generation has that one memory that will never fade however.My generation will never forget the day the world collapsed.American threw the first punch, or dropped the first bomb as it were.No one was surprised at this point.It had been years of the Murica is the best attitude and the country finally snapped.There were many cheers in the streets at the announcement of the bomb.Finally, something was being done to show that we would not stand for the idiocy and oppression plaguing the world.The Final World War was a short one.Much to Americas surprise, no one allied with them.There were three sides to that War.Bombs fell all over the world with no respite.Europe fared best as bunkers from the last World Wars were uncovered and people took shelter.America, never having seen such violent warfare on its own soil, suffered heavy casualties.I was 17 the day of the announcement.I was just beginning to explore politics and form my own opinions of policies after listening to my parents my whole life.The under-30 population banded together quickly.We used social media and grassroots to finally rise up and tear down the government that had caused this bloodshed.Our leader halted the assaults and met with other world leaders.An agreement was made.Complete isolation.Every country would retreat into itself and rebuild, grow, and emerge again in 50 years to try for peace.America struggled for years.The young tried to maintain their carefree, accepting of all attitude while the old were frightened of change.Finally, change began to take place.Without the outside pressure, and our severely dwindled population, we found  maybe not peace  but compromise.Slowly, we learned to live off what still fertile land we could find.Without trade, our society was set back, but our passion led to wild innovation.We learned how to take what was damaged and make it usable.We learned how to recycle and reuse everything, never leaving anything to waste as we could not spare anything during the isolation.We learned to be thankful for our vast lands while other countries, we were sure, were struggling inside their tiny borders.We learned to survive.The day the isolation ended America, the rest of the world opened their arms.They had banded together as well, we found out, and continued society without us.The world, to them, had continued almost as if nothing had happened and America was almost forgotten about.They rebuilt and continued on the same path.After 50 years, World War III is only mentioned in textbooks just as the first two were.They have progressed conservatively.Comparatively, Americas technology is wilder and stranger.As Americas technology is exposed, the world is taken aback.One would be hard pressed to find a Pure American, someone without electrical parts, someone who is not Improved. Its clear how uncomfortable with these advancements the other society was.A few months passed where the two societies tried to find harmony together.Life had a tense undercurrent while people pretended they werent bothered by the improvements Americans made.The world held its breath, worried the tension would boil over again.The tension did persist.The rest of the world could not accept what America had become.We withdrew into our own borders again.It was not so strict this time.People could choose between us and them, but there were rarely vacations between the two halves of the world.It has continued to be a voluntary separation.And that, my dear, is how we became among the Improved and leave trivial matters to the Pure.
