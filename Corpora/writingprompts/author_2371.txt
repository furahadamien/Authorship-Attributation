Thomas sat on the riverbank, overlooking a steep decline to clear, rocky water.He had been there for five minutes now, awaiting the arrival of his friend of many years.A fish splashed in the water below, a butterfly fluttered lazily over his head, and a bead of sweat ran down his neck.Thomas was excited.Thomas was riddled in anticipation for his reunification with Beau.The pair had not seen each other in in what had felt like a century.A rustling in the bushes made Thomas's head snap around, but he was met only by a squirrel darting to a tree.Thomas sighed and checked his watch.A quarter past noon.He knew that Beau should be arriving soon.They had agreed to meet at this river bank when the sun was at its highest, which Thomas didn't fully understand.In the past they had met at cafes, train stations, and basement taverns.The red clay and Sassafras rooted cliff was a long ways off from the nearest road, and the walk along the way was covered in overgrowth brush and patches of mud from the previous week of rain.In no way was this location as convenient as the one in Alexandria.Thomas leaned back against a thick tree and chewed on a slice of jerky which he procured from his backpack.He was well aware of Beau's notorious lack of punctuality, and held no grievances about it.During the man's long tenure on earth time was the least of his concerns.A twig cracked behind him and Thomas twisted around, only to immediately start grinning."Beau!I hope you have a good reason for being so late," Thomas said with a cheeky smile.Beau stepped out of the bushes and sat down next to Thomas, before the old man embraced him.It had been 100 years since the two had seen each other.Thomas was always travelling through different times, with different motives with each coming voyage.On some occasions Thomas came to the table with a wad of money and a smile.Other times Beau would find him with the easily identifiable look of a man who had just gone back in time to witness the Battle of Verdun.Thomas and Beau had been friends for hundreds of years.Whenever Thomas would finish travelling through the past, Beau would be waiting there for him, ready to catch him up on the future.Thomas first got Beau as a teenager, when a litter of puppies seeking declining warmth in their mother who had been a victim of roadkill.It was around this time that Thomas first traveled through time-- one day after a violent fit, he found himself in a Berlin household in the months following the reunification.It took him years to figure out to return home-- 20 years to be exact, far longer than the lifespan of any dog.But waiting for Thomas when he returned was Beau, still a puppy.By now the pair had aged considerably.Thomas was wrinkled and old, but his eyes still possessed fire.Beau's brown coat was still shiny and regal, but now silver hairs adorned his nose, setting off a vibe of wisdom.Beau was wise.By now he was 350 in human years, and at the centennial of that tenure on earth Beau started speaking English, starting with barks and working up a deep, raspy voice.And so it happened that whenever Thomas would disappear into the future or the past, Beau would be there waiting for him when he came back.They would meet, and they would talk.Thomas would tell Beau lucrative stories and Beau would do the same.
