From within the walls of the great city bank, the frightened hostages could hear the sirens and a strained voice over a microphone from the outside.The words were hard to make out, but it wouldnt have been hard to guess.Something, something, hands up.Something, something, surrender.Had it been a normal bank robbery, they might have felt hope.But not this time.Black Bullet, infamous as he was dangerous.He had a plan for everything.He knew how much loot he and his men would get away with, he knew how they would make their daring escape, and he better yet?He knew how much time itd take to make himself scarce before a Super picked up his scent.They havent caught him yet.Why would they now?Confident that all was going according to plan, he couldnt help but be surprised by hushed whispers and pleas of protest behind him.The black caped man turned to face what he thought might be a would-be hero

Only to be greeted by a has-been hero.Oh, no.It cant be, he muttered in disbelief.He approached the frail old man dressed in a humble tweed jacket with an unhidden giddiness in his step.Even like this, the villain recognized the face.Here?Now?How the stars have aligned!

It was his favorite superhero, from his very own childhood.The great and powerful Fire Bane!The champion of the people!Savior of the city!The Black Bullet fondly thought of autographed letter he had hanging back at the secret lair.Stop.Stop right there you criminal The old man wheezed.Black Bullet had to squint slightly but he could see thin plumes of smoke trailing out his mouth.Was that all he could manage these days?He wasnt surprised.The entire reason why Fire Bane had gone into retirement, wasnt because he was getting old.It was because he was losing his special powers.Or maybe he his powers were weakened because he was getting older?It didnt matter in the end.Fire Bane had hung up his cape and publicly unmasked himself years ago.It was the only reason why Black Bullet even knew who he was.He could never forget that face.Not for as long as he lived.He feared he might have nearly given the old man a heart attack as he slapped his black gloved hands on those frail boney shoulders.A gesture, if you glanced once, would have made you assumed they were old friends despite the age difference.Fire Bane!Youve aged horribly! he laughed joyfully.The old man seemed delightfully confused, more so when he was pulled into a hug.Youre so much shorter than I expected!

The old man was warm to the touch.Warmer than what should be normal.But not hot.Not a threat.Not anymore.U-Unhand me! the old man snapped as he struggled against the criminals grip.Ill Ill

Bullet sighed heavily.And did as he was asked, but made sure to look hard and deep into the others eyes.The old man he wasnt all there was he.He seemed to be a little more than just confused.He seemed lost.Hm.Youre not supposed to out on your own are you, old man? Bullet said with a sly smirk.No sir, you have that same look my gran used to have before my folks put her in a home.Did you sneak off on your own?

The old man stumbled back in step, struggling to find his balance.He seemed to be having trouble focusing.Bullet couldnt help but feel for the old hero.Youd think theyd keep a closer eye on a national treasure?Do you even remember them.My folks?

Bullets voice was softer now.Bane didnt even seem to of heard him.Tears stung in his eyes.And although they were tears of anger, he still mentally berated himself.He had told himself hed never shed a single tear more over that memory.It was why he hung that letter.To remind himself.You could have saved them.

I what?S-Speak up, my hearing

I might have understood, Bullet spoke over the confused old geezer.If you just answered my letter.If you just READ my letter and said anything!Or sent nothing at all!

Nothing would have been better.But all he got, was a generic letter.A thanks for his support.It seemed as if Black Bullet was stuck in a trance for a moment.Staring into the eyes of his former idol.He never was one for revenge.He didnt want to get trapped in his own past and risk becoming some clich.But the past had a funny way of catching up with you.Shadows of it, anyways.A voice snapped him out of his near hypnotic state, one of his goons.Something, something, ten minutes.Black Bullet closed his eyes.Took a deep breath.And opened them.Few years too late to the party, Im afraid! He crowed, seemingly full of energy once more.But fear not, Ill leave you with a parting gift to remember me bye!

Like music to his ears, choirs of sharp cries and frightened gasps erupted as he pulled his trusty black pistol from his holster and aimed it at the old relic.Poor old Fire Bane.He didnt even seem to fully grasp the severity of his situation.Something, you absolutely can never forget.
