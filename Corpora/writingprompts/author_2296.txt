Boom.There I was in a pink room with a little girl.I felt my chest and patted my body to check for gunshots.Weird.I swore that one cop got me in the chest before I blacked out.I was gonna kill him for that.I knew I was.I turned to leave the room and get the hell out of this room of color and rainbows and fucking unicorns.I knew I was a bad guy but this was Hell alright.My hand went right through the door.I fell right through and landed on the ground.Half in and half out as I turned over to see my waist through the door."What the actual fuck?"I asked myself as I stood up.About I hear "Language!"From the little girl looking at me."You can't be saying naughty words Mr!Mom says they rot your brain like sugar" she said as she poured air into a cup like tea."Wait you see me?!Listen you gotta get me out of here.This isn't my home" I told her as I went to walk away.I just sorta phased through the door and began down the steps.But then another fucking strange thing happened.I hit a fake wall.Can you believe it?I die, I get put into Hell and now I can't leave this place?I began to push against the invisible wall but it actually begins to move.Home free fuckers!Until I hit the wall again."Where are you going Dad?"I hear from the little girl again.I stop dead in my tracks.Dad?I'm no dad.I turn to tell this little twerp that I ain't her daddy when I stop dead in my tracks.Right there my gears began to turn.A picture on the little desk in the hallway next to some flowers in a vase.A girl and woman.A woman I knew.A woman I was with.A woman I hadn't seen in 6 years almost."Holy fuck you're my kid?!"I yelled.She jumped a bit and yelled "Language!Mommy said that bad words are for adults when no kids are around" 

She says some other things but I kinda go into this trance.Like I just stand still and think.I hadn't seen this girl in 6 years.This kid is probably like 6.Did that one night stand land me a kid?No way, she would have called right?I turn to the kid and point a finger right at her "Me and you gotta have a long chat.I got time and I need a few answers ok?"I ask as kindly as I could as I kneel to look her in the eyes.Goddamnit, she has my eyes too...
