"Your energetic fields are showing distress, specifically at the root..." Hank quipped with a strained look of comical concern."Whatever" Preston retorted, stretching his neck hard in several directions.Those jumps took a bit out of a guy."How's that bucket list going?"Hank was obviously feeling frisky, Preston thought, to be in such high spirits and trashing on a mortals limited life span."Oh, I don't know, when was the last time you got a good night's sleep?"Nice!A zinger!Preston smirked toward Hank as he reached for water."Good one DORK!"Hank knew Preston hated that.Still, he had hit an almost forgotten nerve.Immortals cannot sleep, and the apparent bliss of a body in repose was truly the envy of all time grinders."So did you find the screw?"Hank sat and bent to reach the carry case for the puzzle box."Yeah, and it was a bitch to find too!"He reached into his pocket to feel for the most recent item needed to close in on finishing the game.There were only 2 pieces left after this and the time trials would be over.They were actually making good time and might rank well enough for high placement, possibly even among the starters.The screw was a simple golden screw, one of many parts strewn across time and space which when found and assembled, activated a multi-phase beacon signaling to the Eternals that they were ready for transport back to the Lexicon, a transdimensional gaming sports center for all realities.Preston flicked the screw, unconcerned and in the general direction of Hank as he sat to rest from the jump.Preston watched as Hank effortlessly reached out while staring intently at the nearly fully assembled game cube, and caught the screw in mid air by the tip.What a show off."When your ready I'm ready" He just wanted to sleep, no time for that though, not so close to such a profitable ranking.The leather felt good, creaked quietly as he relaxed."Let me get this placed and torqued, be there in a sec..." Only the Immortals knew the exact specs the boxes needed for correct calibration.Break the box you lose the game.That simple.Preston closed his eyes as he released his internal attachments, watched the thought stream as an observer and accepted the Void.Meditation was a key component to high performing fractal illusion transitioning, what others called time jumping.Preston was an advanced specialist in meditative research technologies and that was how he came to the attention of the Eternals.The act of illusion transitioning itself was something like having yourself pushed through a strainer so only energetic self emerged, to relocate and rephrase back into material form in time and space where you wanted.It wasn't easy and too much unreleased consious or unconscious baggage could actually cause transdimensional pain.The hard part was the intuitive "listening" for the clues though.The puzzle box was tuned to Preston's specific Astral frequency, so only he could locate the parts.C'mon Pres, almost there he thought.He saw himself accepting the award for victory in the tournament.After replacing the cube back into its case, Hank walked up beside Preston's relaxed form."You ready?"Hank said."Hit me" Preston said, fully prepared to enjoin aural energy with Hank.This was like recharging a battery Preston mused, no more like trying to burst a battery.Hank reached out over the mortal form, his hands elevated and steady.He refocused his third eye and slipped into lucid Astral vision.Hank could see each swirling energy center in Preston's form, as colored swirling toroidal light.Only faintly could the housing, the body's form, be seen.The timeless stores of etheric cosmic energy began to flow effortlessly through Hanks outstretched arms.Pops, sparkles and arcs of infinite colors of power filled Preston's body.The vibration started and quickly reached it's faint but audible hum."Found it" Preston whispered.The field surrounding Preston's body took on light, an egg shaped aura.Hank stayed in focus as Preston received as much energy as he could hang on to, enough for the jump to the game piece and the return jump as well.Brighter and brighter, lighting the living room with a living eternal glow.Suddenly Preston vanished.It was OK, Hank knew Pres would be back soon... :)
