Deep down he just felt that this was wrong.I mean, he weighed 700 pounds.He had mandibles.He had poison.His claws were designed to rip through angelic armor.His voice could topple nations and his stinger would cause men to beg for death should they be unlucky enough to be hit.And we haven't even gotten to the scaly hide, sulfuric acid sacs, aptitude for wielding a fork in battle and physical strength that wouldn't look out of place in a Marvel movie.Yet here he was, held to the ground in a forceful grip by a small man in tan shorts."Crikey, it's a big one"

Big one.BIG ONE?He had trained for eons to deal the death blow to arch-angels.He was lord of the fourth circle of the second plane of hell.He could lie better than a professional lobbyist and seduce any creature capable of cognitive thought.No small feat when you have hooves and your breath could lay waste to a Roman legion."The big ones are easy"

The words hurt.He was actually hurt.It was a new sensation and he did not like it.He was made to hurt, not to be hurt."But at least it ain't a parrot.Parrots  always bite me for some reason"

He roared.Well more correctly he tried to roar.His jaws were locked shut.What came out was more of an "ghrhhrggg".He was stumped.His roars was the stuff of legend.Poets wrote for months just by having nightmarish visions of his roars.And where did the film-crew come from anyway?Didn't they always end up down here?He rolled in the little man's grip and cast his vision over the scruffy looking group that accompanied him.Was that a 60 Minutes logo?"He'll relax soon enough.We're not hurting him, we're just waiting for him to calm down"

Aha.An opening for deceit.Such mortal hubris.He would relax and wait for an opportunity to strike.Tear flesh from bone, melt skin and take this imbecile's head and use it for jewelry.He almost cackled madly.Then thought better of it.Deceit.Yes.The Camera crew came closer.Excellent.He could already imagine the agonizing cries as they slowly died on stakes.There.The little man relaxed.He prepared.He could taste the sweet taste of victory.Every muscle fiber in his body struck out in unison."Oh, he's still got some attitude left in him"

Nothing.NOTHING?It was a move that would have obliterated Goliath, but the little man hadn't even flinched.I mean there were laws.Physical laws.Wasn't there?Square circles and all that?What was this feeling?"He'll calm down any minute now?"I mean.If he couldn't even handle a small Australian, why was he even here?He had followed the dark lord for millennia.He had been perfected into a weapon to strike at the heart of hell's enemies.And here he was.Held immobile by some ever-smiling man who didn't even want to hurt him."There you go buddy, there you go buddy"

Was that a pat?A PAT?Did this mortal nuisance just pat his forehead?He would terrorize thousands for this.He would obliterate his descendants, remove any trace of him from history.It did feel nice though.There wasn't a lot of patting in hell really."Just calm down, there"

I mean, it was mostly fighting, torture, scaring people.All that stuff.Not much time for relaxing at all.Come to think of it, being a big scary demon was really more of a life than a job."shh, now"

And that was all good, I mean all-evil.But maybe there was more to life than horrifying the damned?I mean, come to think of it... had he actually done any fighting against the legions of heaven?"we're not here to hurt you"

That was the point, wasn't it?To fight the legions of heaven.But that wasn't what he had spent the last millennia doing.If you left out the grizzly details out of it all, he was really more of a janitor than a soldier."As you can see, he is all calm now"

He relaxed his muscles."I am going to let to now, buddy"

The iron grip let go.He should fight.He really should.That was what the dark lord had instructed him to do.But really, what was the point?"Ok now folks, we'll just slowly get out of here.I don't think our buddy is going bother us now"

For the first time in his two thousand year existence, he relaxed.&#x200B;

"Oh dear", said John."You fucked up" said Jack

They both nodded.It was the first time they had agreed in three days.Which didn't help me much, since my foot was still broken from the fall, and the big guy was still climbing down the fire escape.Maybe he would be as ungraceful as me when he jumped at the end?"I wouldn't bet on that sir"

"Not a chance, bro"

"Well, maybe you two dialectic assholes could come up with a plan?""Really, there is no nee..."

"Oh, shut up, dude needs a plan, not English lessons"

"Well, I never..."

"Plan."The steps were getting closer.The big guy was panting.Why didn't he shoot?Maybe no line of sight.""Well, I see a revolver over there"

"That's a pistol, bro"

"Now who is giving English lessons?"I tuned them out.Yes, there was indeed a black pistol lying next to me.Still, while I'm not from Texas, I still figure there is probably more to shooting a gun than the movies made it out to be.Still, it was at least I plan, I started crawling towards it.It hurt like hell."You go, sir!"John exclaimed."Can you even fire that thing?"Jack inquired.I put my hand on the handle, it was slick from the puddle it had been lying in.Did that matter?The clanks were close now.The big guy must be near the top."Sir, might I suggest that we switch locations?""Huh?"I said."He means the fatso is going to land on you if he can"

"Oh" I said.The clanking had stopped.Maybe the big guy was aiming as we spoke.I started rolling.Closer to the wall seemed like a good bet."Does the gun have a safety, sir?""I don't know... Jack, do y..."

"I'm not from fucking Texas, bro"

Some lumbering was heard.There was a thud.Big guy landed face first and his head exploded like a melon."Oh, sweet heavens, I'm covered in gore" John wailed."This was a brand new shirt" Jack complained.I puked."Who was that man?He seemed awfully annoyed"

"He said something about money.You owe him money, bro?"I dropped the gun.It clanked to the ground.I could suddenly feel my legs again.I could hear sirens in the distance."Ah, police officers.We shall be safe soon"."So why is Timothy tripping?""Whatever do you mean?""Look at him, he is tripping"

"You misunderstand me, I don't understand what tr..."

"Can you two shut the fuck up, for the love of god?"I started crawling towards the alley-way.No disrespect for New York's finest, but I wasn't exactly on their Christmas card list."Sir, certainly you are not wanted by the police?""Yeah, what the fuck man.I don't want to spend my afterlife watching you get double-teamed in Rikers'."I continued crawling."And why are you even here, Jack?Where is the small red man with the fork?""What do you mean, small red man with a fork?And where is that chick with the cleavage and the white dress?""Heaven and hell are not open right now" I said.They looked at me dumbfounded."Whatever do you mean, sir?""Yeah, what the fuck man?"It's a long story I said, as I crawled the last feet two the sidewalk.I slowly managed to hobble myself up alongside a drain pipe."Well, perhaps you should tell it sir" John demanded."Yeah man, don't leave us hangin" Jack agreed."Can you two stop agreeing?It freaks me out.I swear I miss that little smug white-winged sex kitten and the tiny red freak.

They looked at me with a certain hint of nervousness."Sir.. wh"

"Yeah m..."

You're temps, okay?Temps.You're filling in because the good guys and the evil guys have better things to do.Well, or worse... depending on your perspective."Temps?""That sucks"

"So, unless you have the key to purgatory, shut the fuck up the both of you"

They fell into silence."Well..."

"You know"

I looked at them with the same look of a man who is getting told by the wife he hates that she doesn't like him anymore."I do have this broken key" John said."Yeah, me too" Jack offered."Oh, look, they seem to fit together" John observed."huh" Jack concluded."Well, then", I said as I hobbled onto the street while hailing down a cab."I might have a use for you after all"."Glad to be of service sir"

"Oh, shut up you pussy"."You see", I said as I painfully wrestled myself into the cab."I need to be neither good nor evil to use that key.And somehow"...I looked at them both "I think you two are perfect to achieve just that".
