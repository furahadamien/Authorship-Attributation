"Sixteen fucking years", I cry, "sixteen wasted years".I peer over to my alarm clock only to disappoint myself further; it reads: 3:46.What most people don't realise is that we are dreams deep in our lives, what we do doesn't matter.Well except not sleeping, hundreds of years ago science discovered how to keep us alive for more than one day.It was a simple solution: sleeping.That's right, all we had to do was sleep, easy enough.However I'm a terminal patient, I was born with things wrong in my brain, there are things the scientists can't explain.They call it "Insomnia" and I've had it since the age of five.Usually I would take a few pills and that would send me under but my body must have a death wish; no matter how many pills I take my body rejects them all.The scientists go home at six so they can have dinner with their family and live another day.I often imagine how soothing it must be to wake fresh and ready to work; I'm not allowed to leave the hospital.I look around the pristine room for what  I don't know, I've been in here for eleven years but I've survived sixteen, nothing's changed in all my time.There's no windows, the door blends in with the walls, the alarm clock has -

I must cut myself off, the scientists told me not to use my brain to much, if I over stimulate my brain it's even harder for me to sleep.I just have to lie here hoping I can sleep... "SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING!"How has three hours passed?Did I sleep?No the machine tells me I haven't slept in twenty three hours.I've only got one hour left.I'm going to do what any logically person would and bang my head of the walls in the hopes I'll knock myself out.I stand up and walk over to where I think the door is and start mercilessly bashing my forehead against it.I feel blood trickle down into my eyes but I can't stop now, I'm so close.I begin to cry again and slide down the wall, I'm not going to make it.There's only three quarters of an hour left, I've tried everything.Before I was admitted here my parents told me there were no monsters under my bed or in my closet, they said they were in my head.They were right, my mind is committing suicide without me and there's nothing I can do.Half an hour.I've accepted my fate, I've lived a good sixteen years.Oh, who am I kidding?I haven't seen the outside world in years, eleven to be exact.That's what I want!My last wish is to see the outside.I begin knocking on the walls until I find a part that sounds hollow and begin kicking it in.This is exhilarating, why haven't I tried this before?One last hard kick against the 'wall' and it falls flat in front of me.Twenty minutes.I start running down the corridor without looking back.I reach the first pane of glass I see and look out: the sun is beginning to rise.It's so beautiful I stop for a moment.I quickly realise there's no time and head for the stairwell, I basically jump for landing to landing.For someone who hasn't ran in over eleven years I'm doing quite well.I reach the bottom floor and see a few of the scientists heading for the main entrance.I quickly try the door and head for cover, it's locked.Ten minutes.The scientists stand by the door smoking, don't they know that will kill them?They are taking forever.Five minutes.Finally one of them unlocks the door and I take my opportunity.I barge past them and feel the outside air on my skin for what feels like the first time.I keep running and running.This sense of relief is worth the risk, in fact I run for eternity.I close my eyes and just keep running.Then I begin to feel it, my heart slows down and my legs seize up.I tumble to ground and turn to behind me.The building isn't even out of view before I let one last tear drop slide down from my eyes and onto the ground below.I lie down and await my death.
