"God dammit.Really?!I JUST paid for the movie."Steve had been teleported again.This time, to the side of the highway.He really wished he never made that stupid promise but at least he got to see Sandra every once and a while.He looked around.Sandra and Kendrick were present of course.So was their 11 month old Damien, giggling to himself in his car seat.Their late 90's Saab had a flat tire, but nothing else seemed too out of sorts.As always, useless Kendrick waved.Like an idiot."Hi Steve!"Steve brushed him off with a nod and looked at Sandra.She had dyed her hair red and finally stopped trying to cover the beauty mark under her left eye.With the exception of the scowl on her face, it was a good look for her.Sandra growled out the usual, "Nice to see you again Steve.""Hi Sunshine and Midnight."It was a race joke, and Sandra absolutely hated it.He leaned into the window at the smiling child, "Hey Twilight, I missed you buddy.You have gotten thiiiiiiiis big!"Steve said with a big smile as he made a motion with his arms.He turned back to Sandra."Pop the trunk."Steve made his way to the rear of the old wagon and grabbed the spare tire, scissor jack, and wrench.He wondered how hung Kendrick must have been, because he was a waste of air.And space.And life.His entire existence was an inconvenience on everyone, except for Sandra apparently.For the last six years Steve has had to either fix Kendrick's mistakes or fill in as Sandra's handyman.She was not happy about either.Steve tried to make some small talk while he swapped out the spare, but Sandra was being cold as usual and Kendrick was keeping Damien occupied.When he was done he stood up and turned around.Sandra's usual glare had been replaced by a soft look, her eyes slightly glossy.She noticed Steve's gaze and the glare came back.A few seconds passed.Steve was standing there awkwardly looking like he had just been slapped and Sandra was looking like she wanted to slap him."Thanks Steve."It was not spoken warmly.He just smiled and closed his eyes.When he opened them again he was back in his apartment.The pay-per-view movie he had just purchased was 15 minutes in so he hadn't missed much.Not that it mattered, he had seen Pulp-Fiction about thirty times.Steve leaned over and grabbed a slice of pizza.His dog Beach came to beg."She's doing well Beach."The dog looked up at him, licked his hand, and barked."Yeah boy, I'm alright too" he said with a weak smile."I'll be alright anyway.One day."He gave Beach a light scratch behind the ears and turned the volume up.
