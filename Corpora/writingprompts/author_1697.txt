Wilhelm was the local catchpole and ratcatcher, or so everyone assumed.In truth, he was Wilhemn Von Mittlesdorf, Prince of the Shattered Shores.Most people thought it was a lawless land of petty warlords and despots.It was, but there was one law: sixty per cent.That percent was Wilhelm's cut.He was, quite honestly, the richest man alive.Politics and fame bored him.He longed for the idyllic peasant life.And that, of course, brings our tale here.For Wilhelm was being fired by the local reeve, a fat, slovenly oaf by the name of Karl.Wilhelm accepted the firing with quiet, reserved dignity.He returned to the reeve the symbol of the catchpole's office, and left.Returning to his small, humble home, upon which he had spent most of his earnings from catching rats and criminals, he found a notice nailed on its front.The reeve had seen fit to evict him, as well!This made Wilhelm incredibly angry.Firing he could take.The loss of his home incensed him.He opened the door and took but one item: an amulet shaped in the manner of a pursed mouth, and spoke to it quietly."I will reduce it to fifty five, if conditions are met.Respond by sending your levies to Hamfordshire.You are to meet your lord and master there, and then burn it to the ground.I am taking this entire damned kingdom for my own."
