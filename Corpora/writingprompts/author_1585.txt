**Entry 1, Day Unknown**

I found this journal on the body of some poor sap who died here earlier.I decided that between the regular torture sessions I would catalogue just how I ended up here, Well ---

*The Journal entry abruptly closes here*

**Entry 2, Day Unknown Plus 4**


Nearly got caught with my Journal, Had to quickly hide it.Anyway, Hell sucks, but the thing is, most people here are mortal souls, and die shortly after arriving!Who knew, Souls can die.Sadly though, I am neither mortal or a soul.All because I thought I was clever.Have to hide the Journal Now - Guards Coming.**Entry 3, Day Unknown plus a lot**


Time is really hard to keep track of down here...Anyway, I might as well start telling just how I got into this situation.It all started with a god damned Genie, as most good stories do.I was drunk off my ass one night and came across a random lamp in the middle of the dark alley I was puking my guts out in.After investigating it, I came across a Genie in the lamp.Last guy was a real idiot and thought the Genie only had two wishes, and for some reasons the Genies wishes don't reset until all three were used.Just my luc---

*Ash covers the bottom of the page, as if it was dropped in a hurry*

**Entry 4 Day who the Hell knows.Get it?HELL!**


Despite the endless torture, my sense of humor is as shitty as always.Anyway, back to the Genie.I had one wish, and my drunk ass decided to ask to be fireproof.I mean it's not a TERRIBLE trait but like if I was in a fire I would still probably just choke to death on the smoke in time.Little did I know that I did not get the typical type of 'Fireproofing' most people think of.It all started one day when I accidentally lit my break room on fire after I left my spork in the Microwave with my mac and cheese.I fully expected to be fired that day, but then a miracle happened!My Boss just laughed it off!I was confused and in shock for the rest of the day until later that night when it dawned on me that I was literally fire-proof, I could not be fired!And that's when I began to scheme...Guards Coming, Will pick up Later.**Entry 5, Why am I still counting Days**

So, Me with my new found abilities decided to do the absolutely dumbest thing anyone could possibly think to do.I decided to summon Satan and try to get hired as an immortal henchman, and what do you know it worked!He signed a contract that gave me immortality as long as the contract remained valid.All it would take is me going out, reaping souls, torturing the damned, you know, the works!See I didn't plan on doing any of this.At first I thought that I would just be immortal and could just say 'Hey Satan, You cant fire me I'm Unfireable!'.And technically it worked, for about two weeks.See but I forgot the part that this is death, lord of hell.While he couldn't fire me, He sure as hell could torture the shit out of immortal me for being an arrogant prick.And well, that's where I'm at now.I tried to quit a while ago but the contract specifically said I would be his servant for all eternity, however long that is, and so I couldn't.No unions down here either.So that's the story of how I am eternally damned to torture because I thought I could outsmart Satan.--------------------
