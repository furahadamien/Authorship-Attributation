"You're just not what I want, Alex.I'm sorry, you're a great guy, just not who I'm looking for."Amanda tightened her lips.There was no trace of a smile or any sign of guilt.There never was.This time, she had obviously rehearsed her words.*How do I let him down gently?* I bet that's what she was thinking.She was always so gentle.I sighed."It's okay.I figured when you stopped answering my phone calls it was through.Can you tell me what I did wrong?"Anything she would give me, perhaps it would help.Amanda tapped her fingers against the restaurant's table.A sign she was nervous."Nothing... you were perfect.Just.I don't know, Alex, what do you want me to say?"She placed both hands down on the table, apologized once more, and stood to leave.I had already tuned out her words, and had begun to stare at the eyelash she had let fall onto her cheek.As she left, her silver hair dancing behind her.She needed to re-dye it, it had started to fade.*This one was no good too?* I thought I had become everything she wanted to be this time.Impossible not to admire, I watched and wanted everything about her.Her faded silver hair, the freckles on her shoulder, the eyelash on her cheek.The coal eyes asking me for more, even though I had never seen those.One day she would want me, love me, *revere* me, just as I did her.*I just had to try again.*

This time my name was Alex.Back when I had been a Jack... or was it Jerrell...I had discovered her favorite name was Alex.I wanted to be her favorite everything.Of course, I knew she loved blondes more than anything else, with eyes as deep and green as her mother's.I crafted a beautiful back story about how close I was to my nonexistent sisters.I was the perfect gentleman.All of my choices and decisions... she agreed with all of them.For her, I was perfect, so what did I have to change this time?She couldn't even tell me.After fifty faces, fifty different lives, what type of person had I not made myself before?Staring at the empty doorway where Amanda had been, I clenched my fists."Maybe I've been thinking about this the wrong way."I rushed to the nearest bathroom, and began to piece myself together again.The first thing I needed to do was buy a new phone.A new life, a new form, a new number.A new chance."Hi, I would like to buy a phone and look into starting a contract today.""Yes ma'am, I'd be happy to help you with that.
