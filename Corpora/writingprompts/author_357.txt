I uhhh, showed up, to the address I received after calling the number on the letter.It was a small, squalid country home, a bit dilapidated.I cautiously approached the porch, and the porch light came on, seemingly by itself.I knocked.There was a creaking sound and the door opened.An eye peered out at me."Password?"The owner of the staring eye asked."Uh, I uh, don't recall a password."I said."Good, there was none" 

The door shut for a second, then opened fully to reveal a slightly shadowed figure."Come in" the voice said solemnly."You probably won't fully recognize me, due to the incident, but I assure you it's me," he said."You're really John F.Kennedy?"I questioned.He stopped and turned.I could just make out his face...It sure looked like the pictures."In the flesh!"He exclaimed with sudden cheer."And I have an exciting opportunity for you, as I said in the letter."John continued, while raising his hand to presumably a light switch."Which is?"I pressed.The lights came on, and I could see a few folding chairs in a row, and there was podium to my front-right, next to a glowing projector screen that said "Welcome Barack!"In the chairs were a few people, who looked oddly similar to Tupac Shakur, Elvis Presley, and the sketch of D.B Cooper.John proclaimed proudly, "Welcome to the exciting world of House Flipping, where you can make 6 figures on your OWN time!"
