When it first showed up to our sensors, everyone thought it was just an interested asteroid.Sure, it was oblong, and one of the first we'd ever observed, but it was hardly anything special.People speculated that it was an alien ship, but no one really believed it.That is, until it spontaneously reversed it's trajectory.One day, it was headed out of the solar system faster than any man made craft.The next, it was hurtling towards Earth with unnatural precision.The impact alone wiped out Canada and part of the USA.Debris clouded the atmosphere, and the world went dark.It was few month before it began to spread.It wasn't just a space rock or a ship.It was *alive*.And it was hungry.It spread like rot, sucking the life out of everything it touched.Concrete disintegrated, steel corroded to dust, and flames did nothing.Wherever it went, it spewed noxious, toxic gas.Scientists recognized it as a terraforming device.We called it the Plague.People died in their homes, refusing to leave.People stuck in the traffic of evacuation found themselves trapped in a ring of the creeping rot.It seemed to seek out life, so that it could trap it and kill it.High altitude flight was impossible due to debris, and low altitude was incredibly dangerous, because the gas that permeated the atmosphere above the Plague was impossible to filter.The human population steadily shrank, until the only free continent left was Australia.There were less than 10,000 of us when it happened.People began exhibiting strange power.Some could read minds.Others could teleport.Still others controlled the elements.I had the ability to fly.One thing that everyone had in common, however, was to share their energy with each other, from any distance, to boost one another's power.Eventually, one man was found with the power to destroy the Plague.His power was unique.It looked like raw energy, and it erased any Plague it came in contact with.He fired it from his hands as beams and blasts of blue or yellow light.Humanity immediately knew what they had to do.I was one of a team sent with him, comprised of myself, two other fliers, a wind mage to clear the air, a telepath to communicate remotely, and the man himself.Our mission was to fly to the source of the Plague to destroy it once and for all.The flight was short.In less than a day, we reached the origin.It was the only feature in a smooth, shiny black wasteland.A pillar of darkness, like a monument to humanities destruction.At his command, the telepath broadcast his speech to the rest of humanity.I was the one flying him, and I'll never forget his words.As he raised his arms above his head, he bellowed at the top of his lungs."PEOPLE OF EARTH!*LEND ME YOUR ENERGY*!"Fukin' weebs.
