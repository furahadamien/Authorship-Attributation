Startled awake by a hand on his throat, Jamie flinched hard, the thumb digging in deeper."Is this some sick fucking joke, Jamie"!"Bill roared, squeezing a little tighter."Answer me, you little shit!"Opening his eyes to slits, Jamie took a raspy breath.As his eyes fell upon the mug sloshing whiskey all over his bed, he realized instead of "#1 Dad" like it had said 4 years before, when Grammy had gotten it for her son, instead... That was too many digits for Jamie to even try to guess how high the number was."N-No sir...I don't know why it says that."Jamie squeaked out, barely able to make a sound with the meaty hand still on his throat."You know you're lucky, right?Your whore of a mom just walked the fuck out because she didn't want a little fucking brat like you.You know that, right?"Bill squeezed again, releasing his son after the boy nodded."If I find out you had anything to do with this, it'll be another month in the punishment hole.""Y-y-yes, so-sir.the terrified boy managed."Go the fuck back to sleep, and don't piss yourself or you're doing the laundry."With a slam of the door, Bill shuffled drunkenly back to the couch, and flipped from the crap porno to the news, a rerun from when he had been asleep."Well, John, it looks like all mugs that once said #1 Dad now show their real ranking.It appears that even just painting #1 Dad onto a mug forces it to change into the proper number."The last noise Jamie heard before he sobbed himself to sleep was his fathers yelling, and a ceramic mug exploding upon hitting his bedroom door.

David sits at his computer, trying to type through the maelstrom of screaming.He shifts a row, typing numbers into the document as though the sounds were just the buzz of cicadas or the music of crickets, rather than the soundtrack of hell.Pushing his glasses down and rubbing his eyes, he sighs loudly out of frustration.You know, He starts, tone a bit sharp, Youre keeping me from doing the job that I have to pay the rent.Do you know what rent is? He starts to become sarcastic, even condescending.Rent is that thing you pay to let you have a roof over your head and to keep you safe.

After doing another line of values in his spreadsheet, he pauses,  yelling at the voices.If you want to live here, or in my head, you might as well start paying some damn rent!

Feeling a little bit better, he takes the quiet to mean he can go back to work, only scratching his arms occasionally.He mumbles the numbers aloud as he types them, unsettled by the near-silence.He zones out, typing the numbers almost on autopilot.When he finishes the last line, he hears a familiar female voice, one he knew instinctively was named Leah.She steps up close behind him, her caramel skin contrasting with his pale neck as she rests her hand on his shoulder.In the reflection of the monitor, shes not there, though.Come on, David, you need to go to bed.If you stay up too late, itll just get worse.

He hears the jingle of her bangles, the sound of her arm rubbing against her dress as she lifts it to tuck her hair behind her ear, but in the reflection, hes just staring at himself.Shaking his head, he logs out of the computer, turning its screen off.He smiles at Leah, taking her hand as he walks into his room and sits down on the bed.She smiles at him, moving quickly to the other side of the bed.He shuffles down, getting into the right position and curling up to her.He wraps an arm around her, nuzzling his face into her hair as he starts to fall asleep.In the morning, he wakes to his alarm and the voices screaming, his head pounding, eyes heavy, and him still feeling half-asleep.He looks at the clock, then hits the button to turn it off, climbing quickly out of bed and rushing into his bathroom to pee.While standing there, he notices an unfamiliar voice whispering, or at least incredibly quiet, under the screams.Ignoring it the best he can, David finishes up, washing his hands as the toilet flushes.He picks up his glasses from the bedside table, unsure of when hed taken them off the night before, but glad theyre in one piece regardless.He pushes them up his nose, catching a glimpse of his wild eyes, rimmed with bags from being exhausted, staring back.Ignoring that too, he walks back into the living room, planning on polishing the report before sending it off.Before he can even sit fully, though, he notices a letter, addressed with his name in calligraphy no less, resting on his keyboard.Using a nail, he pulls back the flap of the envelope, surprising himself when it flips up easily.What falls out, though, isnt a letter, but bills of various denominations.He grabs them all, noticing it says something on the flap of the envelope.He turns it, reading, RENT in neat handwriting.If he hadnt remembered snapping at the voices, hed be confused and maybe even laugh.But instead, he clenches his jaw, starting to count out the money.One two three eight ten twenty thirty fifty one hundred He trails off, mouthing the numbers instead.Shuffling the money through, he counts again and again until he finally accepts that theres at least two months rent in the envelope.The voice hed heard under all the screaming laughs, amused at his discomfort but still too quiet to be heard properly.From what David can tell, it sounds like an older man, but it could be almost anything at this point.He stands up quickly, grabbing the envelope and stuffing the cash back in.He closes the flap, holding the envelope tight as he stands on a small stepladder to check his shoe box safe at the top of the closet.He shakes his head as he pulls down the box, seeing that theres already a stuffed envelope in there.Shoving the other one in as well, he closes the box and tosses it back into its place on the shelf.Looking around, he hunts for any clues as to where the money came from.Picking up his keyboard, he finds a single penny, but nothing else.In the kitchen, he sees a figure, all white with the exception of the shoes, cutting something.David steps closer and closer, especially after seeing it has no reflection like Leah.Turning back toward David, the man grins wickedly.Oh, I see you got my payment.I do enjoy a good show, and Im so pleased you chose to let me stay in here.I do believe well get to be good friends, dont you?"-----

The final shrill note of the monitor faded from my ears, leaving me alone in silence deeper than I could ever imagine.There wasn't black so much as... nothing.No shiny gates rising out of fluffy clouds, no cherubs bobbling around overhead with their harps, no big guy to judge me, nothing.Not even fire and brimstone, just... nothingness in every direction.I knew I didn't have a body anymore, the aches and pains, the pressure of gravity, all of that was missing.Instead, I was just something like a consciousness spreading throughout this space.The silence stretched on for what felt like eons, until I stumbled across a faint light.It was like pouring myself into a glass to try and get to it, squeezing and sloshing against the boundaries of whatever this space was, until I found the source; A tiny rip, no wider than a human pinky, stretching and widening into a hole.With all the effort I could summon, I shoved at it, trying to get whatever was "me" in.With a sudden burst of relief, I felt myself flung violently, catapulted from the dark place I'd been before.The light was blinding, spilling in from several windows framed with pink fabric and off-white lace.The walls almost matched, a white horizontal bar separating the colors.Shelves lined the walls, holding toys and books.I started turning to take in more of the room when a tiny voice pierced the quiet."Hello there, Mr. Wibbles.Have you accepted your in-vite-tation"" she asked, splitting the last word."That dress simply won't do, this is a *nice* party."I looked down, only faintly able to see myself.My arms, always muscular and hairy, seemed almost sad in their state after the battle I lost.My watch and tattoo were still on my wrist, and I otherwise looked normal, but the hospital gown looked like it had seen better days.Some gross blue-green-yellow polka dotted thing clung to me, and I sighed, surprising myself at the noise."Sorry, kiddo, I didn't choose it."I told her, not expecting a response.She tutted, shaking her head like my wife always did."Come now, Mr. Wibbles, that's a... a poor excuse."The fake posh accent she'd been using fell, and she smiled up at me."We simply **must** make it better."She sttepped carefully, her lips forming numbers as she stepped away from the table toward her closet, her hand scrabbling for the knob.She twisted it, throwing it opened, and felt around, lifting a massive feather boa in all of the colors of the rainbow.Next came a large strip of fabric, like a huge scarf or a small blanket.Her mouthing continued, nearly silently counting as she stepped back to the table, grabbing the edge of it as she passed.She looked straight at me, then smiled wide."Kneel down, please."she asked, holding out her arms.I did, my knees not cracking or popping for the first time in a very long time.She lifted the cloth first, draping it over me like a shawl.It wrapped loosely around my shoulders, topped with the boa."Better?"I asked her, and her toothy grin widened, showing her missing teeth."Much."she responded.She grabbed my wrist, helping me up, and guided me to the table.With her left foot, she slid out the tiny stool, running her hand over the edge of the table as she walked to the child sized armchair on the other side.I sat slowly, folding my knees up under the shawl as I did so.I lifted the cup, pretending to smell the tea, when she raised an eyebrow."Mr. Biggles, the cup is empty."she told me, grabbing the pot."Would you like some?"I nodded, putting some of her accent in my farmer's drawl."That would be marvelous, m'lady."The giggle she gave me made it all worth feeling silly."I'm Emily, silly, not 'my lady'."She poured the "tea", really just water, and I lifted it to my lips, sipping it quietly."I have a question, though."I nodded, looking her in the eyes."Why can I see you?"I sipped the tea again, then shrugged."No idea."
