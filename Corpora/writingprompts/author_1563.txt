The artist spent eternity examining their latest creation.To human eyes, it would look like a small glass case, nine inches wide and six inches high.The left half of the case was plain black, with tiny shimmering lights.Halfway through, there was a ribbon of color, with another black expanse to the right.Near the end, the color crescendoed to a rainbow, filling the rightmost inch of the case with color from top to bottom.The artists eyes were experienced.They altered the position of a molecule on the left side of the case, and the rightmost inch became streaked in black.Time was a human word for cause and effect.When you had only the small view, you need words like second, minute, hour.When you watch from the outside, you can just point to the spot in the case.The artist took a deep dive, zooming in.Inside a house inside a ribbon, a woman sketched plans.Her day job was nothing, something to pay the bills while she worked out her true passions.She wanted to push humanity to the stars, and had the brains to do it within her own lifetime.The artists eyes were expert.They altered the position of atoms centuries in the past, and a tiny hole appears in Earths atmosphere, in just the right position to let a little more radiation pass.The ribbon thins to a hairs length.The artist glanced at the remainder of the Earth, a moment of time for one to which time meant nothing.They saw skeletons in robes, jackal-headed humans, men crossing rivers.How cute.They made art for the artist.The artists eyes were open.He returned to the outside view, and with a few tiny alterations, his hard work was undone, and the right three inches of the case burst with color.They set the case to the side with the others.They too, were full of life.Every time, he sought to create a clear, empty piece, devastating in simplicity.Every time, he grew attached.He picked up a fresh container, and began again.______________________________________________________
