Brooklyn New York.Winter.2040.Mr. Burnside slouches in his Archie Bunker-esque recliner pinching a cigarette near the filter.The flickering glow of the CRT television illuminates the haze in Mr. Burnside's one-bedroom apartment.12 years prior, the nation reverted back to CRT when it was made public that flat-screen technology causes infertility.At first glance the area is clean and modestly furnished.Copious dust and beer tabs underneath the furniture betrays the amount of "real cleaning he has done.After the 9 o'clock news hour, the requisite 5-minute block of adverts hum through the space like a muffled trombone.As the next commercial begins, Mr. Burnside scoffs as he has seen it before.The menacing female voice-actor cuts through the airwaves, "100% of Gary Burnsides living at 408 W 39th St Brooklyn NY will die of cancer if you don't stop smoking."
