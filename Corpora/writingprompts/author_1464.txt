The Last Smoker.Sounds like a movie title.Hell, maybe they'll make a movie about this anyway.Mind you, they'll probably miss the point - make it all some serious "compelling" drama about a man's moral struggle with the fuckin' tobacco.That's not what this about - I'm a just screwed up old man, who refuses to let the world take the last thing it can from him."Your addiction will kill you, Jason Warner!", scream the posters.Well, if my addiction kills me, isn't that just the problem solving itself?It's almost funny - I got my name in big letters, all over the place, just because people I've never met don't want me to die.There's nobody I know personally who wants me to stay alive.Just these concerned strangers, and the fuckin' posters everywhere I go."Quit smoking, Mr Warner!""WE'RE ONE PERSON AWAY FROM A SMOKE FREE EARTH".What, ya think I didn't know already?Like some writing is gonna change my entire world view.Like I said, this is me vs the world now.The world took my job, my wife, my future - but it can't take my cigarettes.Anyway, this is who I am now: I am the One Who Smokes.I'm a fuckin' legend.If I stop smoking, what do I become?I become a meaningless shell of a man, sitting around waiting to die.This way, I have a purpose; a battle to fight.It's me vs the world, and I'm going to go down smoking.
