"Wait, you want to do this," he asks softly, raising a brow at the young woman.The man was young, around his mid twenties at least.His hair was a beautiful gold, and his eyes were a deep blue that would be easy to get lost in, if the young woman wasn't so excited."Definitely.I know exactly how to do it too.Please, just give me the job, I want to do this," the young woman pleaded, surprising the devil."Hold on, why do you want to do this so badly?The worst you've done is lying and hurting someone, why are you so excited to hurt people so much?""It's only fair.People can be so cruel to us, screaming, yelling, sometimes even trying to hit us, it's much worse than this hell," she says shrugging softly.The devil paused for a moment before looking the woman over, now noticing just how 'well dressed' she was.A simple black baseball cap, blue jeans, and a simple green shirt...plus two extra items.A blue vest with white trimming and words, as well as a pin that stated her name.'Luna'

The rest was faded or broken."So you worked in retail?And how did you die there?The employers are normally good about that stuff," the devil said softly."Black Friday.Sometimes people get too excited.Now can I please get to work, this is basically the only job I'm excited for," she responded happily, bouncing on her toes a bit.After a moment, the devil agreed and handed the woman a key card on a chain.She smiled before taking the card and chain, carefully putting it on her neck and walked away, ready to get started with her new job.\_\_\_\_

A few months later, the young woman sat on her throne like chair, smiling as she looked down at her work.Everyone who had done exceptionally cruel work, was now forced to do your old job; retail work.Many souls who were unfortunate enough to join the ranks, soon learned just how horrible they had been to other people, but were forced to continue their work until the devil himself decided that they could rest, which rarely happened."You're surprisingly good at this," he said softly, standing beside the young woman who simply smiled.She had done her job, both in life and in hell.To her, it was a job well done, one that moved her from simply torturing cruel souls, to becoming the devil's right hand man.
