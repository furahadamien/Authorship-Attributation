My name is Ellie now.The only one who can see me is a little girl, just barely reaching the age of six, with mud brown hair falling in chaotic ringlets and eyes the color of the inside of a kiwi.She seems oddly familiar.But I don't know where I saw her before.I don't know how I got here, all I remember is rain pounding on the windshield as I fell asleep in the back seat.Letting Derek take over driving for the night since I can't stand them, I don't like not being able to see past the minimal light that your headlights reach with into the darkness trying to grasp the unseen, as your tires eat the road.We were going to our parents anniversary, I was so excited, we hadn't seen them since we left for the city to "follow our dreams" seven years prior.I remember the despair I felt when I realized my dreams were childish and naive.But I couldn't admit it to them, I was stubborn, still am.So I continued reaching for the unseen and unattainable in denial of my idiocy.But now I'm here.Sitting across from a child with crooked and dirty crown on her head as she asks me if I want 'one lump or two' her kiwi eyes blinking up at me questioningly."Two, I've always had a sweet tooth" I answer, still trying to figure out what exactly is going on, why no one else can see me except this child.Why I'm even here in the first place.Giggling she "scoops" two empty spoonfuls of sugar into my teacup before "pouring" tea into it from an empty teapot."Well Milady Ellie" she starts before sipping from her empty teacup with flourish, putting out her pinky to show good manners, after all she is the Queen."How is the Kingdom I gave you doing?Taking care of the people well?"She finishes elegantly, saying it with a slight lisp.Picking up my tea I hold it up to my mouth acting like I'm drinking.Might as well play along, and make the best of whatever is going on."Oh, just swell darling" I pronounce over accentuated in a snobbish voice making her giggle again."The Kingdom is doing just amazing, and the people?Oh, even better!"I end with a slight British accent, butchering it horrendously."That's great Milady Ellie!How are the kids?"She asks, probably hearing it from the adults around her.Kids, that's another reason I left to the city.Escaping through my bedroom window at two fifteen with only a backpack and the clothes I had on me.I had to walk till morning before I reached my older brother's apartment, he moved to the bad side of town because our parents would never guess that would be where he would go.He only told me.Anyways, after that night I never went back because my parents are strict, more than strict.So I left when I found out I was pregnant.Had twins 9 and a half months later.Two beautiful baby boys I named Tyler, after my grandfather, and Rhylin, after their father.Grandfather was the only one to show me love, other then my brother, before he died when I was fourteen peacefully in his sleep of old age.As for the father, I loved him.But he couldn't handle the commitment.So I left."Hello?Milady Ellie?"Focusing back on the little girl I notice her reach out her hand to touch me in concern.Moving my arm away before she can touch it I wipe the tears rolling down my face before sniffling then putting a fake smile on it."Yeah honey, I'm fine."I utter in a soft rasp before clearing and saying louder in the same snobbish accent, "The kids are great!How about some croissants?Maybe some mini sandwiches for a snack?"Perking up she bolts for the door "YEAH!SNACK TIME!"she yells behind herself at me while running.Getting up I follow her out into the hallway covered in soft carpet before abruptly stopping at the kitchen that has tan tile floors.I see the little girl pulling on a young woman's pant leg while asking for croissants, mini sandwiches, and other various snacks for her tea party.The woman looks familiar.Extremely familiar.She hasn't even turned around yet.But I could recognize those chocolate colored curls going down her familiar shoulders before stopping at her familiar hips.That lead to her familiar legs and familiar feet anywhere.I know where I am now.I know what's happening.I understand what's going on.I died.I can see that now.I guess it is true you see your life over again when you die.I guess I just didn't realize I would be my own imaginary friend.
