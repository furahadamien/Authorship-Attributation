I wake up

Interestingly enough, it wasn't the nightmares that woke me, it was my phone.It making an soft buzz on my desk."Great, forgot it on again" I murmur while stretching my arm to grab it, still half-asleep."It's an beautiful night tonight.Look outside"

I don't recognize the number.Why send something like this at this time?I'm confused.This has to be the worst joke someone came up with.I lock the screen and place it on my desk.Not even one second later it buzzes again.I grab it angrily, dragging it towards me and almost dropping it, hurriedly unlocking it to see what it is now."It's an beautiful night tonight.Look outside"

Another number."What the hell" I say, a little scared now.The people behind this really are taking dedication in their act now.I stare at the screen for another second when an notification pops suddenly."DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON"

Again I'm confused.Staring like an idiot to the screen.Then it gets another notification, and another, and another, and another.It doesn't stop.Thousands of messages suddenly appearing.All just like the last."It's an beautiful night tonight.Look outside"

I drop the phone.It still buzzing.It kept buzzing while on the ground, messages rapidly appearing on the now cracked white screen."This can't be happening"

Just now I hear them.Voices, thousands of them, producing an soft hum almost inaudible thanks to the buzzing.I take one step towards the window, the blinds closed as usual, I slowly put my trembling hand on it and retreat "No.Can't do it" I whisper under my breath.I have to go out, I have to see if I have really gotten crazy or if something is happening.Eyes locked to the ground I open the door.The humming louder now, it seems to come from everywhere.After crawling to the next house I knock at the door.Getting desperate my knocking gets harder, almost pounding it now.My neighbor opens it."Look up" he said, not missing an beat, his eyes locked onto mine like an madman.I can't look up."What is happening?Did you receive it too?the messages?""Look up" he says, louder now."What is happening?"I scream.He gets angry now, eyes jumping from their orbits and face getting redder."Look up!You have to see it, it's beautiful!Look at it!"And he grabs my face."No!Stop!"I scream, crying now, tears falling from my face, the humming never stopping."Why don't you listen?Just look up!Please, I'm begging you, everything will be better after you do it.Just look!"And he pushes my face upwards.Now I understand, it's beautiful.It's not the moon, it's the whole sky, it's amazing, nothing can describe it.My tears are not from fear anymore, they are from joy.I run to my house, it paining me that I can't see the beautiful sky.I grab my phone.It buzzes gently in my palm.I unlock it, the cracked screen not slowing me in any way.I quickly write and hit send, hoping that it reaches everyone.They have to see it, they have to feel it."It's an beautiful night tonight.Look outside".
