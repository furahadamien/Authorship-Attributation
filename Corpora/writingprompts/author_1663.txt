A shaft of light opened to the darkness beneath, revealing a vast hellscape.The legions of the damned saw their opportunity, lunged for freedom.The lone figure standing in the charred remains of a kitchen looked understandably distressed, in the way of someone whose first foray into making soup resulted mostly in water vapour and a portal to hell.This whole mess had more or less started with an minor accident.Not his accident, which could be likely categorized as "quite a big deal", but rather his gram's injury, which had left her with a bad leg and a worse temper.In a fruitless attempt to pacify her, he'd decided to try and make some soup, borrowing an old cookbook he'd found lying on the fridge.Now, he didn't have all too much experience with cooking, so he figured he would compensate with fanatical allegiance to the recipe.When the recipe demanded he whisper forbidden words in long-dead tongues, he'd figured it was probably something like how talking to plants made them grow more.When it called for tears of the innocent, he'd rubbed some onion into his eyes and hoped that shoplifting once didn't count against his innocence.When it called for the blood of a virgin, well, that one sorted itself out neatly.When he had nearly finished the recipe, readng one of the final steps, he was taken aback."Shatter the veil?What does that ev-"

It was then that the pot collapsed into itself and the screaming started.His head pounded.All around him, it felt as though reality itself was opening in directions his mind could not comprehend.A thousand discordant voices flooded into his thoughts, each of them whispering his name.Try as he might, he couldn't quite convince himself this was part of the recipe.Shortly after having surged through the opening created by the soup, the demon realized his mistake."Oh no no, not this place, NOT AGAIN!Some poor moron always takes the bait, and this time it's me!"it yelled, in a panic rather unsuited to its form.The demon's many eyes darted about, looking for an exit.Seizing upon a nearby window, it jumped at it, and crashed headfirst into an invisible barrier.It was then that the demon noticed him."Hang on.You aren't her."it hissed at him."No?"he replied, unsure of if he should be offended."Well then, how in the seven hells did you summon me at all?!"it roared."I don't know!I was trying to make soup!"he yelled back.The man was very much nearing his breaking point.Making soup was the nice thing to do, and he would not be accepting criticisms from a goddamned monster."Tell you what, human."said the demon, adopting a more gentle tone."You set me free, and I will make you the best soup in all the worlds."Before he could reply, the twang of a bowstring interrupted him, as a bolt flew into the demon's body.Man and demon looked on with surprise across the room at the aging woman brandishing a crossbow.As the demon slumped to the ground, still looking confused, the man's grandma limped over to the kitchen."Thanks for preparing the ingredients, sweetie.Now run along to the living room and I'll finish things up."she told him, with a terrifying smile.Not being one to argue at this stage, he hurried over to the couch and tried desperately to not listen to the sounds of what he prayed was not something being butchered.Twenty or so minutes later, his grandma called him back and offered him a steaming bowl of soup.Biting back his revulsion at the likely demonic meat in his soup, he swallowed a bite, and paused for a moment."Huh.Tastes like chicken."
