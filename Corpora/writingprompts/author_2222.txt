Velocity was amped up, she could feel her heart beating in her chest.It was like a fast staccato beat forcing the blood around her system far faster than it ever should.She could feel the pressure inside, pulsing through her veins and she liked it.It was like her skin was stretched and being forced to contain a far greater power than it should.That feeling spoke to Velocity it is exactly what she thought of herself, she was a far greater power than any of the normal people who stood like statues around her.As she walked up Central Avenue she could feel the constant battle her body was undergoing to keep itself from ripping and bursting with the force of her pumped up system and no one knew, no one could even see her.The very air around her felt thick, like she was moving with little weights attached to her limbs.Nothing else moved around her, or it did but to her it moved so slowly it might as well not be moving at all.The silence was surreal to her it was peaceful, she was moving faster than sound, moving so fast that even the colours of everything around her seemed ever so slightly out of focus.All of this she loved, it meant she was doing what her body was meant for, she was moving at speed.&#x200B;

Shift enjoyed his life and he had a lot of life to enjoy.By his reckoning he would be about 348 years old, if he had actually lived in all of those moments.Shift had never been in a rush and he had never needed to.He could live in a place where time moved differently, for every hour his mind thought had passed barely a second had passed for anyone else.It always amused him that his mind still needed to count in seconds and minutes and record time when time had no hold on him.Shift had become accustomed to being alone, accustomed to the silence and the way everything looked a little blurred to his eyes as it moved in its minute little increments.It gave him the ability to do what he wanted when he wanted.Moving down Central Avenue he had no idea what he actually wanted, he had done so much and it was getting harder to actually find something interesting that he wanted

Velocity saw movement ahead it was such a shock that she allowed herself to slow

As the world burst into life, sounds cascading around, the world coming into focus, the wind ruffling and moving down the street, people and cars seemingly leaping into action, it was Velocity and Shift who where now completely motionless.&#x200B;

It lasted for only a few heartbeats and then Velocity started moving again.The pressure in her body mounting as her heartbeat raced and the world started to slow.In the same instant Shift slowed the world and started to move.Once again the sound faded and disappeared, the wind ceased, people and cars seemed frozen again and the blur or distortion in the world came back.They ran at each other locking eyes and matching direction.In no time at all they would meet, no time and yet all the time in the world.&#x200B;

As they came together it was Velocity who acted first throwing her left fist straight at Shifts face.She couldn't understand he simply stepped aside, the blow missing wildly.&#x200B;

As Velocity's fist passed him by he turned and tried to throw one of his own, but Velocity simply turned her body and stepped to the side and there was no contact.&#x200B;

This went on with Kicks and punches being thrown.Grappled and wrestled and pushed until finally both starting to feel the first signs of fatigue, both with same growing look of alarm and confusion on their faces they looked at each other.&#x200B;

Velocitys mind raced, this had never happened before it was a fair fight and it turned out she was terrible.&#x200B;

Shift couldn't believe it this had never happened before he was fighting a fair fight and he was terrible.
