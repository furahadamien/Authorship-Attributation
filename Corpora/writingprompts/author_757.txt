His name was seymour.He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxofonist.He had wet dog smell, even when dry.And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus.We understood each other.People thought he was just a dumb mutt who smells bad and can't find a girlfriend and has a crummy job.But he kept it real and called no man mister.
