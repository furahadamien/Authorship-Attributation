What am I looking at?These aren't my hands.My hands are bone.Why does my hand have skin on it?And I am...glowing?My sickle is gone.I just have this long wooden stick now.The blade disappeared...I dont know, three, four years ago?Its so hard to tell time anymore.Flowers and plants have started to grow from the edges of the top where the blade used to be.This robe is getting hot, too.It used to not be like this!I used to know what my purpose was in this world.I was the Black Kiss.The Grim Reaper.*Death*.And now...I dont know who I am now.Things are so unfamiliar.I have existed for an eternity, more than an eon.People *feared* me for all that time.They would pray to their Gods that I would not take them or their loved ones.I would take anyone I pleased, whenever I pleased.The Harbinger, they called me at one point.Yesterday, I saved a kid from falling out of a tree.Little guy could have killed himself!*What am I saying???* He could have killed himself??Isn't that my whole thing?This isn't me!I don't understand it anymore.I see less and less of them now, since the Big Take.Damn, that was a busy month.Clocked in at 3,034,478,205!Personal record, for sure.Those were the days... Oh my God, that one is about to accidentally set himself on fire, son of a bitch..They are so clumsy!I dont think I ever noticed that before.It was just business as usual.But goddammit if these things don't seem to look for trouble around every corner.And why so fuckin fragile?Whichever God made them, they played some sort of sick joke, I tell you what.All these vital organs that are essential to keeping them alive is held together by a friggin flesh bag.Terrible design.Today, something weird happened.A little girl..saw me.Like, she *saw* me.Waved at me and everything.She said "look mommy, its Life!"The mother couldn't see me, but I could tell she could feel me just the same.And neither were afraid.Neither cowered at my presence.Instead, the little girl ran up to me and tried to *hug* me.Did you hear what I just said???She tried to *HUG* me!But the weirdest part of it all was...I didn't try to stop her.In fact, I instictively held out my arms for the embrace.I *wanted* to hug her.Don't get me wrong, I have hugged plenty before her, but all those people died when I hugged them.I hugged them for that purpose.And now, I just want them to stay around.I like them.....*Life*.That's what I am now, I guess.I don't really know now anymore.All I know is I kind of...I don't know....*love* these creatures now.Its as if they leave for good, *I* leave for good.Its like we need each other now.Maybe thats how it is.Maybe I do need them to exist.If that's the case, then I can handle this strange new look I have now, this odd skin that has grown over my once white and dry bones.I think I can handle it.I just want to find that little girl and give her a hug soon.
