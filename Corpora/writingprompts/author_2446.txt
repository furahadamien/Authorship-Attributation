Day 2075,
Dear diary,
I had this feeling again.It clearly seems like I am the only one who can get things done here.After the hard night's work, I come home to see the sheets still not folded, clothes scattered, dishes around, bottle of wine on sofa next to an ice cream bucket.I can't stand it, it's unclean.But I love Michelle, so I cleaned it.How was my day?Aw, aren't you the sweet one dear diary.It was good.Phillips calls me too ideological, I don't agree with that.I have arranged for the weapon and I would be planting it tomorrow.On the roof.Why on the roof?I hate hypocrisy, I want to prove that what I am doing is not harming others, what I am doing is what I believe is the only way to solve this problem and it is not my intention for other's to die so I can be happy.I am ready and willing to sacrifice myself so others can be happy and so, I will send Michelle to her mother's and I would do it.I would never be a hypocrite.But I also know that if I don't do it, no one else is capable of.The future would be because of me, I would be hated but that is a price I am willing to pay.No one would understand this, so there is no real point explaining.I should just do it.Bye.
