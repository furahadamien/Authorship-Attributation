Day 3650: In the last ten years here, Ive spent many nights wondering how being in here could be lucky.They  say Im an anomaly.They say my extraordinary luck makes me dangerous to society.But it has to be a glitch right?How can I be lucky when Ive been locked up in this horrible place since they found me?My parents hid my number as best they could.They would try to hide the second zero on my skin, cover it with makeup, plaster, whatever they could find that would cover the glowing.It worked until I was in first grade.Someone spilt milk on my arm, and it washed off the plaster.I was seized within three hours.Pretty unlucky for someone with perfect luck.They dont treat us too bad.Most of us are kids, and the guards I think feel sorry for us.Most of them are pretty lucky, ranging from 65-80.We have books and movies, and we get time outside between our classes, and the cell doors are never really locked.The girl in the cell next to me is my best friend and we spend a lot of time dreaming about being out and being free and about what other girls like us must be doing with their less lucky selves.The only thing really terrible is the food.They feed us food grown in the garden here, which we help grow and manage.It all has a weird metallic taste that can be hard to get down.They say its because of the soil here.It has some weird mineral in that came from a meteorite that landed nearby.Totally safe, but it does change the taste.Hopefully, they will realize we arent a danger soon and I will be able to get out.All of our escape attempts have failed.Maybe 100 luck means something else.Maybe we arent supposed to have perfect luck.Maybe it means the same thing as zero luck.So far no one has been born with zero luck that they know of, so maybe thats what we are, those without any luck.Day 3655: Somethings wrong.The guards are scared, but they wont tell us whats wrong.Some of them didnt show up, and the ones that did keep running into the wardens office.Theyve turned off our TVs too.Day 3658: I think the world is ending.We hear loud explosions outside the prison, and theres only ten guards left, all with luck ratings over 75.We could probably easily escape at this point, but most of us are afraid to.Faced with freedom we realize most of us have no idea what to do on the outside or how to find our families, and with the disaster happening outside we seem to feel safer here.Day 3661: One guard came today and he was sick.He showed up and pulled us into a huddle around him.He gave us the keys to the wardens Office and said, take care of each other.You might be the only hope we have.You might be all thats left, and then he slipped into unconsciousness.Hes still alive, but barely.We went into the wardens Office and turned on the tv.All stations were broadcasting the news station, and there was only one reporter.It was a virus.It killed most.If it didnt kill you, it changed you.Very few were left.Even those left were weaker.Except us.The last few days wed felt stronger, wed had more energy.One of the older boys had even lifted  up the back of a car earlier just cause he felt like it.How ironic that being locked up and eating weird food would actually be lucky.Maybe if we can find the right people, they can figure out why were immune.Maybe we really are the last hope.
