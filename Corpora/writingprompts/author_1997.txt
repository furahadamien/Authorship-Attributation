Ogg not know what death is.Ogg just change when rock fall.One day Ogg was on hunt, hear crash from cliff above.It go dark even though sun was out.Dark everywhere.Ogg look down.No skin or meat.Ogg just made of bones.What is this place?This where deer and mammoth go after Ogg eat them?Ogg no see other animals.Ogg was scared, ran until exhausted.Nothing but black still.Ogg walk for what feel like ten moons.Ogg nearly give up, lay down in blackness, think it be like this forever.Ogg yell and no sound return.But then, Ogg see small star in horizon.Little light.Ogg very tired, very confused, but walk as long as Ogg can.Light gets bigger and bigger.Ogg approaches, light is like open cave but bright.Ogg walk through bright cave.Ogg surprised!See trees, see sun, but sun not feel hot.See sand and ocean.Ocean water tastes like mountain steam, not salty.Ogg look at hands and made of flesh and skin again.Look up and see wolf pup.Wolf pup Ogg's first friend and lost on hunt long time ago.Ogg so happy to see old friend!Where is Ogg, and why is new place so good?Is this what dead mean?Ogg realize where Ogg is.Happy place with no pain.But journey very scary.Some time go by and Ogg hear someone yelling.Yelling come from back through cave.Yelling from darkness.Ogg know that sound.Sound of scared like when Ogg first die.Ogg go back to help them find happy place.
