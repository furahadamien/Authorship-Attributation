My nayme is dog
And when I yung
I look and smell
For my mum

But no mum is near
So instead
I curl up in rain
I go tu bed

The nex day
Sun is brite
I see a man (gender?)He smel alrite

He pik me up
He nice and care
He smell good 
He dry my hair

He gib me fud
He stroke my back
He luv me 
I luv him back

Now I old
Grey and weary
I luv it here
It is not dreary

The same man
Now big and strong
He cry for me
"It won't take long"
