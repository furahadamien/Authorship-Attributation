Rad 7:11

When JC, the bro of bros appeared in the temple courts where all the people gathered around him to be properly schooled the Man and the Pharisees showed up unannounced in a gnarls ass way and brought in this hella fine chick caught screwing with some other dude that like wasn't her man and stuff.They made her stand before the group and Chad asked them, 
"what's up bros why do you bring this babe here to us" to which Brad responded,
 "Dude don't be an idiot they totally want our boy JC to comply with the laws of Moses and get her mad stoned".The pigs then asked JC "what is it you would do with this woman?"and our boi then lowered himself and picked up a rock and turned it into a blunt then exclaimed, "Let he who is without sin take the first hit"
