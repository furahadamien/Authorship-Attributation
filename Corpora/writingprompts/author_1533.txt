Excuse any mistakes om formatting, I'm posting on mobile and pretty new at this.It was in the gaudy and unnecessary home office of one Chadwick Sommersby III, when he felt it.The slow, icy sucking feeling that came at the start of all of this.He stowed the small present into his deep pockets knowing what was coming."Santa called Edwin!"He dropped automatically to one knee his heavy calloused hand pressed against his chest and waited, trying to remain calm.The Frost Giant guards led the party, next were the two watchers assigned to him Cupid, and the other one, the new bright eyed lackey he hated.Druhner was the old man Donner's grandson and was an utter bastard.He flipped an errant light blue lock of hair out of his face and smiled at Edwin and glanced back at Flurwynn, the ancient beautiful time keeper behind him.Followed by Grim Iysjitt, the great wizard.The tingling scars on Edwin's reminded him to smile, bow his head and 'Ho, my Lord" to each one as was the law.He forced himself to remember who he was, and why he was there, but that feeling, as if he was drowning in winter air was overwhelming his senses with rightful terror."Give honor to Snowkinaar!Lord of the North, chieftain of the tribes and bringer of law!"The Chieftain's seemed annoyed, more than anything.He sat on the nearest chair, and focused his bright green eyes on Edwin."Santa called Edwin, I have reason to demand that which you are concealing."Edwin's mind raced, the council could only be exposed on mortal ground for so long."Flurwynn holds time in ice, but it is still precious."He held out his hand, and Edwin handed over the box.Beneath the fear he could feel more tiny blooms of defiance opening inside him.It all he had stumbed upon the 'unanswerables.'He could still remember Donner warning him away from the "cruel and glittering embers of the human ashpile."Donner had more empathy than the others.Edwin longed to see his old watcher's warm dark eyes.Instead he watched Snowkinaar inspected the elegant black and mercury glass bottle nestled in the grey velvet lining of the ornate ebony box.He peered at its contents and placed it gently on the redwood desk."The official correspondence from one Miss Typhannii Helene Sommersby, states she wants one," he waved impatiently at Drunher, who handed him the letter "Sweet Georgia Debutante doll.That was the official letter."He levelled his gaze."Santa born Edwin, explain why you are delivering instead some sort of sandalwood cologne laced with some sort of chemical."Edwin closed his eyes, "I know the law, and I delivered all requested gifts to the child of this house."His voice suprised him, he sounded like the Colonel Edwin Owen Bramley of his youth, the man who survived the trenches to explore the icebergs.He heard then felt the burning crack of a switch across his exposed neck."Santa called Edwin, I will not ask twice and that horribly named whelp will see the cost of your insolence!"The soft jingle of the bells on Snowkinaar's staff strengthened Edwin's resolve.The high elves and their smug condescention started all this."All appropriately requested gifts were delivered to all the children of this house, despite what your spies may have said!"Snowkinaar leapt to his feet along with Edwin who, despite himself, was almost shouting.Flurwynn stepped hurriedly past the guards between the two men."Santa born Edwin no mortal requests poisoned buiscuits, please explain yourself!"Edwin knew enough that this was no act of kindness, Flurwynn liked order and the situation was rapidly moving away from that.Edwin stood straight and squared his stance."Chadwick Sommersby II still lives, cologne was requested in an electrical correspondence by Chadwick Sommersby III."The guards began moving in as Snowkinaar stepped close enough for Edwin to feel his breath on his cheek and Flurwynn's arm against his hand."The gift stands," Cupid's thoughtful voice cut the tension, "but the poison still requires answering."Snowkinaar glowered at him."You are out of turn."His eyes returned to Edwin, "Your watcher is correct in his insolence."The tension eased slightly.Edwin had prepared for this moment, a grand speech on the horror of the unanswearbles and the cruelty of dolls and tennis.In the past he imagined himself expounding on the evil of witholding the powers of Elvin magic in a world where it could bring hope and healing.He imagined himself feeling grand and righteous in these last moments.Instead he thought of Typhannii Helene, her awkward graceless gait, her desperate need to please and the twin monsters curled asleep in the master bedroom, and reverted to what the  Council of Elders would understand."Per Holly-Case section 1 part the fourth on budget and efficiency: need and want can be combined across family gifts when allowed."Snowkinaar, lifted his chin.Curiosity diluted his anger "In her official letter, Typhannii and I am quoting from memory 'just wants a peaceful happy life, Santa I feel like things will never be okay."Edwin composed himself, speaking with the bravery and dignity he imaged he would if captured in the field."I admit to misuse of established regulation, and unapproved incorporation of pre-made materials."He took a deep breath and continued."Chadwick is a child of this house, his father is here and requested this and ergo this gift cannot be revoked.""You dare to engage an Unanswearble," Snowkinaar, pulled the wrinkled folded note from his sleeve " And then dare tell me I cannot revoke a murdering gift?!"Snowkinaar gripped his staff."If on balance the harm will be over-balanced by joyous tidings and cheer, then no, you cannot."Edwin's eyes flashed, if only they had captured him during the War."Your new watcher did not list the recipient as naughty,  and if you review the visual report you will see exactly waht he is, therefore the gift stands!"Snowkinaar grumbled the imcantation and pointed the Yew at the first reflective surface he could find.In the dim reflection of Chadwick III's deeds, the malice in his face melted to sadness and the muscles in his cheeks and jaws went slack and he waved the image away."The clock Flurwynn."The chieftain shook his head as if to clear it.The air felt better, Edwin could breathe "I speak this to the law; Santa born Edwin you will be given permission to address Unanswerables within the confines of our law under review of the honorable Donner of the high Court.Will you adhere to this law?"Edwin nodded shocked."It is so."He turned to Drunher, " The law of the lists is sacred, I expected more from you."He nodded for the party to leave."Drunher and the guard Blisrr will remain here.Blisrr you are to make sure the gift works using Drunher," he turned at the glowing portal "if it fails use the iron and leave him here.""Santa called Edwin, Merry Christmas."
