Attempted to recapture the spark with June, years after it was gone, in the city.Three young teens standing on the busy street corner, clearly lost, I flag them a cab, give them $20, which pissed June off but was the highlight of an otherwise boring, but polite, evening.* We split up a few months later when I transferred for my dream job and the start of the best parts of my life.*See V. 7883497629AJHBF6899

* For valentines day when I was 14 years old , I spent the day with Tiffany, Alexis and Susie.I secretly asked Alexis to pretend to be my girlfriend because Susie was getting aggressively forward with me and I didn't like it at all.Alexis would do anything for me, and I trusted her to go along with it, even though we knew how she felt about me.We were best friends, but she invited these chicks to spend Valentines day with us, even though I missed our time alone.We had dressed poorly for the weather, and got lost in downtown Chicago after shopping Clark and Belmont that afternoon.We needed to be at the Metra station asap before the trains slowed for the night.Luckily, some old dude saw the anxiety, confusion in Alexis' eyes, then must have noticed we were all freezing and wet from the rain.He flagged a cab for us and gave her some money.After the cab fare and tip, we had just enough to afford some pretzels to split between us, while we waited 2 hours for the next train to the burbs.Alexis snuggled me and fed me pretzels, pissing Susie off, but keeping her at bay...Tiffany and her were whispering up a storm of snipping and fuss.I was elated, tho, that everything had worked out, thanks to some random stranger, and been a fun day.Later that week, I saw Alexis again and finally came out for the first time, starting that process.
