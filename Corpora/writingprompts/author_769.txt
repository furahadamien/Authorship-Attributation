"So tell me about this 'little' theory of yours again Michael", Vince said with an air of amusement."It's not a theory, it's a fact.I may have been wrong about the fluoride in the drinking water and the Illuminati running everything but I know of a conspiracy that is far more sinister than aglets.""Wait, what do you know about aglets?Umm, I mean... what are aglets?""Vince, they're the little plastic ends of your shoelaces.The shoemakers created them in a step of permanent, planned obsolence so that you'd have to buy more shoelaces when they break off and unravel.""How many people believe this nonsense?""Not many, but that's not the main point here.Vampires created 'Welcome Mats' as a way to enter peoples homes easily.""No, no you are mistaken.Vampires don't exist, but this mess about the aglets needs to be dealt with.Who else have you told about them?""Why do you care so much about the ag- you're one of them aren't you?""You know too much, my family and I make our living off everything surrounding shoes.DON'T FUCK WITH OUR BREAD AND BUTTER!"*Michael Runs*


"Oh-ho-ho, a chase!Try your best, but I will catch you!""You're unreal, stop following me!I'm ENTERING MY HOME, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED IN!"*cocks shot gun and moves back a few steps*


"How long do you think you can hide in there Michael?A day, a week, a month?""Forever, I can work from home and order everything through Amazon bitch!""Oh, I'll show you who's the b-"

Vince trips off of the top step and crashes into the entryway of Michael's home.Only...


"You're leaning on air like some kind of preposterous mime, what the-"


As Michael crouches down to look under the body suspended in mid-air, Vince spits at Michael."Tatami mat-flip!"And with vigor, a mat that lay on the ground of the inside doorway of Michael's house deflects the spit, but flies out of Michael's hands while landing at Vinces feet."That was a bit undignified of me Michael, but I do thank you for granting me entry to your home.""I've done no such thing, what just happened here?"Vince easily steps over the mat that bears the characters:



"Ykoso Weeaboo.Welcome to hell.You're right about everything, but what happens next will be open to interpretation for each of the parties involved."
