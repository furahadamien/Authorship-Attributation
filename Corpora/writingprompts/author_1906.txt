Well this is peculiar, I've never seen a writing prompt that seemed so directed toward me.It's especially odd that I'm seeing it tonight, on Reddit's front page.I'll just say this - I'm actually a paramedic, in real life.I think you're already pretty iffy on that, so I won't elaborate about anything else.From what I understand this is a subreddit for fiction writers anyways.We got a call tonight for a psych, code 2.I can't tell you the address because that's a hippa violation.But psych code 2 means somebody's got a case of the blues and it's not that important of a call.Anyway, this lady's got a white camino parked on the front lawn, and water damaged cardboard boxes cluttering the driveway.My partner's name is Bethany.She's an EMT, but a damn fine one.The way it works on the boxes out here each ambulance gets one medic and one EMT.I run the show, basically.So I knocked on the door, and received no answer.I knocked again and still nothing.Bethany suggested I contact PD or at least wait for Fire.I looked her in the eye and cancelled Fire over the radio partly to show her how salty I was and also because I had a better idea and that was to open the door, which wound up being unlocked, and let us both in.She trailed behind with the gurney and equipment while I entered and looked around for the patient.The lights were all off, so it was pitch black inside.This isn't that unusual - 70% of the calls we get in EMS now adays are old ladies who can't walk.Which means they're not going to call 9-11 than bounce around turning all the lights on in the place and prepare you a nice pot of warm tea.None of the light switches worked, so I continued to announce my presence as I walked through the place.Odd but oh well, not everyone pays their electric bill.Bethany stayed behind, near the front door, which I can understand because she's got concerns that don't bother me anymore.I always carry a penlight in my pocket on psych calls because often times they turn out to be overdoses.If it's heroin and their pupils are constricted, I can whip out some Naloxene and begin treatment.So I pull out my penlight and use that to navigate through this shit hole of a home.You ever seen that show call hoarders?I haven't, but there might be an episode about this place.I'm not sure if its normal for hoarders to shit in every room of their residence but this lady sure did."Who's there?"she finally says.Her voice comes from the back room."Paramedics," I say."What's bothering-"

My voice stopped once I saw her.Sweat was pouring off her forehead like it was a goddamn fountain.She was morbidly obese, had gray hair, and was more pale than a ginger.I set my monitor down and placed the limb leads.Each needed some tape just to stay put."I can't do this anymore," she said."It's not salvageable.""What's not salvageable," I said, as I secured the electrode to her left leg.I turned over my shoulder, "Bethany get in here."I finished with the fourth limb lead and checked my monitor for a rhythm.V-tach at 330, I shit you not.I feel for a pulse but it's too weak to palpate."Bethany, get in here!"I shouted."I don't know why I'm here.I don't get it.I don't like it."says my patient.So V-tach stands for ventricular tachycardia.It's the rhythm you get when patients are about to die.It's extremely rare in living patients, and pretty much non-existent in alert patients.Oh - and I've never seen it above 250.Her heart rate was 330 at this time.My standing orders call for me to cardiovert her.That means applying two giant pads to her then shocking at 100 joules.Same procedure I'd do for a dead person in V-tach, only difference is the joule setting I shock her with."There's something outside!"Bethany shouted from the front door.I tossed the BP cuff on my patient, started it up, then pulled out the negative and positive pads and applied them to my patient.BP came back at 72 systolic so I was in the clear to go ahead and shock."Let me die," said my patient."Please let me die.""Well you shouldn't have called 9-11," I replied.I set the joules to 100 and pressed charge."They're here for me," she said.I think she was disoriented, at least I was sure of it when she said it.I pressed shock.My first glance was at the monitor, looking for a rhythm change.Ideally she goes back into a perfusing rhythm, but often enough they go straight to asystole.She somehow went into a rhythm that I can't put into words.The rate read around 610, but that's not even possible so don't quote me.Oh my God, that fucking stench.You'll know it when you smell it.The white waxy shit hit my arm, and I looked up to find her skin sloughing off.Like the worst burn patient I ever had.Her face slid down to her sternum, her hair was disintegrating like lit cigarette.She was saying something, but her tongue must've been melting too because I couldn't make out the words.But the thing about burn patients is that the skin and muscles melt off the bones while the bones stay put.Her bones were black, and I swear to you they turned to ash and started breaking apart."What the fuck," I said.I returned to my penlight, and watched this unfold.I don't really have a good description for this.It was like watching a decomposing body in accelerated time.It didn't make sense from a medical standpoint.And whenever you see that as a medic you start to react like a human.I packed my shit up and started toward the front door."Bethany where are you?"I said, making my way through the dark house with my penlight.I had the chills and my hairs were raised.I feel really stupid writing all of this down because I thought I was above it.I've seen people die, hell I've seen people talking to me die in front of me.I've seen mangled extremities, babies stop breathing, you name it and I've seen it.I've never seen anything like the shit I'm describing to you, so trust me when I tell you it spooked the shit out of me.When I got to the front door Bethany wasn't there, only the gurney.I continued to look around but I couldn't find her.I even returned to the patient, at least the chair she wasn't in.The patient's body was nonexistent - no skeleton, no melted flesh, nothing.Even the parts that had melted onto my forearm were gone.I radioed dispatch and requested PD.Well, that's where I find myself now, sitting in the ambulance parked outside.My partner is nowhere to be seen, and the patient is non-existent.I guess I'll call the coroner but I'm not sure how to explain this.I guess the only other thing worth mentioning is that I just called dispatch and told them my partner is nowhere to be seen.I didn't tell them about my patient because it doesn't make any sense and I don't want that recorded and played back to me in court.I did, however, ask dispatch about the call they received from my patient.Apparently she had told them that she isn't able to die and doesn't know why.She's been here for centuries and nobody has believed her or given any sensible explanation.This is the part of the story that bothers me the most.I don't really want to get into it.I don't know what's going to happen from here, and for the first time in a pretty good while I'm pretty scared myself.I'm glad that I saw this prompt tonight, so thank you to the mods for posting it.
