It was hard enough to process the blinding flash when the sight returned without a reason but this psyched me out completely!The first instinct was to look around frantically and see if there is anyone in the same room!I closed my eyes and wiped my tears then took a deep breathe.I had to pick myself up and keep calm.I slowly open my eyes and see the house I lived with walls turned to awful graffiti.I look out of the window and see that nearly everyone still had their walking sticks and walked in a tumbling manner like blind people do.I grabbed my stick and unfurled it.I heard the phone ping.A message was read aloud  Message received from boss, put your headphones for privacy if need be!Or else authorise dictation!
