"Nobody knows exactly how long they've been here.By the time they revealed themselves on that fateful day, it was too late.They had infiltrated every facet of our lives, from our neighbourhoods to our government.Shapeshifters.They had been our friends, our co-workers, our in-laws.A small colony had landed originally, but their numbers had increased exponentially.We were outnumbered.We were outfought.We were almost completely eradicated.Until the awakening.As children growing up in the Western world, we had heard stories of magic, of witches and wizards.Arthurian legends of Merlin.In the East, tales of Genii were abound.Dismissed as folklore for generations, we had assumed it was all fairy tales, a way for our ancestors to explain what they did not understand.How wrong we were.There is speculation as to why magic has returned, but nobody really understands.One theory I hear the men discuss is that as the number of humans decreased, their power increased.I saw a film along that premise once.I wonder if I'll ever get to see another film, read another book.I wonder if I'll ever be able to relax again at all.Some think that magic returning is God's way of saving humanity.I'm not buying that.I can't believe in a higher power after what I've seen.Where was their fucking God when the aliens first landed?When their numbers grew?WHEN THEY BUTCHERED OUR FAMILIES IN OUR OWN HOMES??Fuck God.We are the gods now.Our resistance is small, but it is not the only one.We like it that way.No outsiders.We had been unable to fight them at first.Against their natural, bug-like form, our bullets are useless.In their human form they could be shot, but they acted just like us, *looked* just like us.You could never tell who was one of them, at least not until the power returned.It gave our eyes a reddish glow, marked us from them.Their alien eyes hadn't been able to pick up on it, and we had taken advantage.We butchered thousands of them before they realised we could tell them apart.It wasn't enough.It's never enough.Some of us have learnt to harness our power, our magic.We can fight the bugs in their natural form, which is how they spend all of their time now.We can break through their carapaces.We can call in the elements at will, rain down fire and brimstone on them.WE CAN BURN THESE UGLY MOTHERFUCKERS FROM THE INSIDE USING ONLY THE POWER OF THOUGHT!But they are many, and we are few.And so the battle rages on.I am sending this message out, in the hope that anyone is still listening.In the hope that anyone is still out there at all.Let us not go down without a fight.They may have us on the back foot for now, but the human race is stronger than you or I ever thought possible!Harness your power!TAKE AS MANY OF THESE ALIEN SONS OF BITCHES DOWN WITH YOU AS YOU CAN!"*End Transmission*
