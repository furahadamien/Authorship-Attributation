I remember my heart stopped beating for a second.Could it really be true?Jail?I had laughed at the time.If people with 99 luck could survive being the suicide bomber, then no jail would hold me.Everyone had a luck stat, which determined how lucky they were.However, I had 100 luck, and upto my knowledge, the only one alive.Nothing had ever gone wrong for me, ever.I simply aced my way through life as if it was a traficless highway.Fuck 'nobody's perfect', I was perfect.It was that a perfect summer day (but then, when wasn't it?)when they came to arrest me.To be frank, I never saw it coming.Literally.Someone blindfolded me, and, before I could scream gagged me and threw me in a van.It was the first time I had ever felt so... helpless.I remember hoping in vain for the van to crash, leaving me unharmed, or for a small meteorite to come crashing through the window and hit my captors.Nothing.Nothing at all.The next time I saw light, I was bruised and wounded from the ride.They shoved me into a cell, and gave me a piece of bread to eat.It was only after seeing the others that I lost hope.Till that point, I clung stubbornly to the belief the somehow something would come to my rescue- but I got nothing.After seeing the other inmates, I knew why nothing happened.All the other inmates- they had 100 luck too.No wonder nothing was happened.Gradually, I became deader inside.I no longer could taste the salt on my cheeks or the pain of my wounds.I was dead on the inside.Then, one day, there was a change.We had a meeting, to mourn the Warden's death or something.They claimed that little bitch had saved out lives or something, and we must pay our respects.Bullshit.But it was on this day, I noticed something.Why my mind suddenly fired up, I do not know.Maybe my luck had finally decided to activate.What I noticed was the number of guards that were lined up in defense were exactly 1 more than the amount of prisoners.Trivial, I know.But it rekindled the faith in me.The faith that we would escape.It was on my second discovery that my heart stopped beating.The guards had 100 luck to.My heart raced, as I got a theory.A crazy theory to formulate a crazy plan, but I wasn't scared.For the first time, I felt alive.That night, I convinced my three bedmates to follow my plan.It all happened so fast.We trailed our recreational instructor-guard back to his room.All we had to do was simply wish for his demise and BOOM!a bolt of lightning fell right on his heart stopping it.Beautiful odds, I'll tell you.I rushed to the intercom like a man possessed.Like I expected, the guard there stood no chance.So I was right after all.The call-to-arms echoed throughout the jail, bringing the prisoners back to life.My plan was working beautifully.51 inmates and only 50 guards.They were finally outnbered, we had the upper hand by 100 luck.We could escape.And we would've escaped, but that wasn't the plan.No the plan was different.That was simply a make-believe I had told them.I still remember Andrew's voice as I walked right past the open gate.Oh so sad, so hurt at the betrayal.He tried to run after me, he tried to catch me, to kill me- but that gate literally shut on him.They were fools, to think the plan would involve them.I would be the one who was unaccounted for, the only one who's desicion mattered.And I wanted to keep it like that.By the time you hear this, you probably already know my name.I named myself in memory of that incident where I  had defeated them all.I called myself Trump.
