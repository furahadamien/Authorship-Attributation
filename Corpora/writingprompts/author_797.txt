"Seriously guys!Just hear me out!"Pride pleaded."Why should we?We all had an agreement!"Wrath shouted."Ya!We agreed... to work together to destroy the world and... you gorge yourself on humans and get... a whole month devoted to you!"Says Gluttony through a mouthful food."I think next year I should get your month!And call it covetousness month!"Greed says while twitching his fingers like the kleptomanic rat he is."I cant see why anyone would want *hhraaarhh* a whole month, seems like a lot of work to me?"Sloth says with a yawn

"I wish I had a whole month for me!Maybe I take September and then I'll have what you have Pride!"Spoke Envy from the corner of the room."Or, just maybe we could settle this elsewhere?Like maybe in my room?"Winks Lust

"Dammit Lust!Not everything is solved with fornicating!"Wrath spits."Why'd you break our agreement though Pride?!"Wrath continued "We seven agreed to do this together and yet you decided that you're better then us and want a month to yourself?"He scoffed."No, no, no!That's not what pride month is!The humans made it up to support their LGBTQ+ people, its not actually about me!"Pride supplictaed with the other six

"Whatever!You've always thought you were better then the rest of us and you know it!"Wrath says through clenched teeth."Trying to fool us, "oh no it's not about me!I promise", what a lie!"Wrath sardonically says mimicking Pride."If you dont believe me just go down to earth and watch the humans do one of their pride parades!You'll see then it's not about me!"Implored Pride."What if I dont want to?"Sloth spake with eyes half closed

"No Sloth we're going, all of us!Then we will see just how much Pride is full of himself and watch as his grandiose plans crumble!"Wrath says with a cynical smile.
