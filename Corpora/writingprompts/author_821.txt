Elubious
How does the baster, damned, soul of a sinner and tyrant, left in the darkest deepest circle of hell, end up becoming leader and a savior.The Mongol, Lord of many lands, got a lot farther by fighting a lot smarter, by being a lot tougher, by 2014, they locked him in a private locker.And everyday while small times were being tortured around em, away in his cage he didn't struggle just waited, inside he was longing for someone to take a part of, the Khan was ready to beg, plead, watch, and act of his rocker.Then Jesus came and panic began to reign.Management kisplacing keys it was time to take the reigns.Took a sword from inside just ignoring the pain, held it in the air and just let out his name.Well then word got around, that guy is insane.Took up arms just to get him an audience.Take your rightful place and don't forget from wench you came.Hells gonna fear your name.What's your name sir?Genghis, my name is Genghis.And there's a million fights I haven't won, but just you wait just you wait.

"I put my name on the ballet"
You know that you're hated right Elobian?It's fine I have a plan
"I'm running too, I have 20 wisdom so I'd make a great leader"
"I got this guy's, I've been known for years"
Fine, you can run for office, the audience if baffled by Elobian as he walked up to the podium.What do you do?"I promise to build a wall, and I'm going to make the Mexicans pay for it."What the fuck Elobian?You know what, fine.Roll.It's a 20.Massa damn it.Anyways the crowd cheers for you, chanting to build the wall.Give your up next."I'm going to make education affordable"
All right, do a charisma check with advantage.It's a 1, and a 2.The crowd doesn't even notice you took the stage, one of the proctor's even asks you to get him a coffee."UNLIKE CROOKED HILLARY I WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, ITS GOING TO BE TREMENDOUS"
Really man?Just roll
Got a 20, what are the odds.Sigh, the crowd now noticing Gib starts booing her relentlessly while cheering Elobian.You know what, I can't do this anymore, it's getting too realistic.*Several weeks later in another game
"I invade Poland"
Of course you do.
