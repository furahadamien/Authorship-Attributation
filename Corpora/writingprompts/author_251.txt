Kevin listened to the Oracle while sitting on the cloth that covered the pile of rubble beneath it.He's heard the tale more times than he can count: on that fateful day, 25th December of the year 2017, fleets of starships darkened the sky, and leveled the human civilization.The oracle spoke of times when humans were plenty, the time when people would gather in the weekends for drinks, the time when people fought amongst themselves over petty differences They're all gone now.The aliens wiped them all out.All those years of hard work, all the things they have learned over time, the monuments they managed to build were all erased when the fleet arrived, and, according to the Oracle, glassed the planet.The oracle never spoke about how many were killed, perhaps even he doesn't know.He did however, spoke in detail as to the destruction of civilizations: How the tallest buildings erupted in flames, how the people simply turned to ash without even burning, how none managed to find out a way to deal with the aliens despite many of them spending thousands of hours practicing how to fight them 

The next part always dreads Kevin.The oracle would move close to him, ignite the candles in the hut with a motion of his hand, and tell Kevin it is his destiny to overthrow the aliens, before telling him to put out the candles without leaving his seat.Kevin sat as still as he can.This is going to be another failure, another time he would disappoint the Oracle and his people It's not like he doesn't have any idea on what the oracle wants him to do.Kevin knew the oracle meant for him to create a gust of wind with his mind, similar to how the Oracle lit the candles with his mind.Oracle Kevin said while lowering his head in shame, you know I can't do it, I've been trying since the first time I was here.There's just nothing I can do... 

Kevin remained in his seat, concentrating on creating a wind to put out all the candles.He had been doing this dance every week since he was ten.And now, five years later, he still hasn't been able to accomplish this simple feat.Kevin continued to think of the wind, a strong breeze came through the door, blowing out all the candles.Just as Kevin was wondering whether this meant success for him, the Oracle signaled him to hide under the rug he was sitting on, before doing so himself.Kevin knew the alien patrols are nearby.Unlike putting out the candles, hiding from aliens is never something he had trouble with.Although he is having a tingly feeling, something is not right.And then he realized, none of them packed the candles.He pondered what he should do, as he heard the footsteps of three aliens jumping onto the ground.Each step they take, their greaves make a sound that warns everyone nearby of their presence.The message is clear -- be out of their sight, or be killed.The footsteps growing ever closer.The aliens will search the area when they see the candles.Kevin thought of his next step.There are none.Had he been able to put out the candles earlier 

The scream of the Oracle pulled Kevin back to reality.As he peeked from a hole in his cover, he saw one of the aliens, in his shiny silver armor, holding the Oracle in the air.The other two were stand next to him, crossing their arms, probably enjoying the sight of their comrade killing an old man.Kevin thought of what he should do: continue to hide, and let the aliens take his mentor?Or would he try to fight them, and die.The Oracle would never wanted him to throw his life away for anyone, that he knows.He is important to overthrowing the aliens.But what good would he be if he didn't save the man that taught him everything.What good would he be if he died here...

Another scream.Kevin two pieces of debris, got out of his cover, and hurled them at the aliens.The aliens stood steadfast, letting their armor deflect the rocks.Kevin picked up another one, threw it at them again, nothing.Another one, and another 

Until his arms grew tired and his couldn't pick up anymore rocks.The aliens looked at one another, as one of them produced a pistols from his holster, and began taking aim at Kevin 

*Why am I so useless* 

Kevin thought to himself as he stared the alien in the eyes, prepared to die, he is useless anyway.The alien squeezed the trigger, a blue bolt of energy launched at Kevin.He instinctively raised his hand at the bolt.Just as the bolt was about to hit him, he felt a warm wave of energy concentrate on his hand, flowing to his palm, and outward to the incoming projectile.The bolt hit his hand, but it didn't hurt.And the feeling of warmth continued flowing through Kevin.Kevin concentrated, looking at the aliens who are going to kill his friend.He let the energy wave concentrate on his hand again.Except this time the feeling is much more intense.He looked at the aliens one more time, and unleashed the wave of energy at them.He watched as his assailants come into contact with the wave of blue energy, and burned to ash in mere seconds.Kevin rushes towards the Oracle and helped him get up.Together, they packed up their camp and headed home.

*Carl ended up going to prom with Alice, I hated him.* 

I giggled as I read the line.This library of biographies is fantastic.There is so much memory of each person, all collected within one room.Everyones life is recorded, every scrap of information, every thought, every emotion they felt at the moment.There is no one insignificant in this room, from historical figures to the beggar, all of our stories are recorded.Our experiences, whether they be of a hard struggle or of a blissful moment, not a thing that made our lives colorful is missed from these biographies.I still remember that moment, when Alice came to tell me she was going to prom with Carl, the utter humility, the disappointment It was everything to me at the time, and I hated the son of a bitch.The the one who showed little interest in actually committing to a relationship, the one who ended up dumping her anyway after the night, was the one who actually got to go on a date with her.Even then, I toughened up, and acted, pretended, to give them my best wishes and extending my hand to him to tell him no hard feelings, so I can tell myself what I nice person I am.God I hope that poor bastard suffered the rest of his life.And thats when I went to look for Carls biography.Section D, number 10523, it was a remarkably short one.I am in my fifties and my biography is already the size of a Thesaurus, his is more close to a high schooler's notebook.As I turned page after page, I realized, his life is remarkably boring.The guy spent most of his early life in-doors, quiet, without much friends.Commentaries on his experiences remained bland for the most part -- Learned to ride a bike, just like dad said I would. And another Straight As again, mom would be proud. There were no further comments on what those experiences actually felt like.They were just a description of an event combined with how he thought other people would feel about it.There was also very little mention of himself, which is odd for a biography 

Until I reached the section about Alice.The narration here is different.There were detailed descriptions of how he thought of her as the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, how he would go the library on days she would go study What a creep.The next section somehow returned to the old boring narration.Diagnosed with lung cancer, inoperable.Best case scenario, two years 

The guy died within two years later, and more than half of this book remained is about the two years he had!The rest of the biography read like a bestselling novel, each event, no matter how tiny they seemed, was filled with emotion, with hope and strive, with how much he wanted to ask for Alices hand despite knowing hes dying.How hard he worked to be comfortable talking to others, the jokes he had to memorize to make himself sound funny, the countless webpages he read to make himself presentable.Asked Alice to prom today, she said yes surprisingly.I knew she was supposed to be going with another guy, Matt.I know he loves her, and I know there wont be a future for Alice and me.I just had to do it.Im sorry... 

I quickly flipped another page, I had no idea.Matt didnt flip out.Perhaps he knew how pathetic I am, or it was because he saw there will be no future between Alice and me Despite this, he extended his hand to me, and told me there was no hard feelings, that neither Alice nor me owe him anything.He patted me on the back, but there was something odd about it, he was hurt, yet he remained strong.He told me to have fun, that theres one prom and that's it, before telling me to be brave with a wink. 

Alice and I had a blast at the prom.She seemed interested in seeing me again, and so am I. I looked at her beautiful blue eyes, they definitely sparkle under the night sky.My sight lingered on her as I am reminded my doctors predictions.I told her we won't be seeing each other again.I tried to give her a pat on the back, but she shoved me away with tears in her eyes Getting admitted today, getting worse.Though each time I lay on the bed, I can't help but remember Matt's look when he patted me on the back -- have fun, and be brave.And I did, thank you Matt! 

I closed the book, a barrage of emotion hit me as I struggled for words.There doesn't seem to be any for this moment except perhaps
