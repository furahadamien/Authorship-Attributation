*Ow!Dont hit me!* an echoey voice of a woman said.What made that sound?I looked around in my bedroom and saw nothing.The only source of light was my electronic alarm clock at the side of my bed.There was a flash of lightning.I could see a silhouette of a woman leaning over my bed.Was it my paranoia?Or was it real?I waved my phantom arm like I did in my sleep.*Ow!What was that for?I knew that our relationship was on the rocks, but why do you have to be that mean?*

Now I knew I wasnt imagining it.Somehow I hit something with my non-existent arm.Someone there? I asked.*Cant you see me?* the womans voice asked.No.Where are you?

*Right here.*

The lightning flashed again.I could see the face on the womans body.It was my dead wife.The way she looked before the accident in which I lost her and my left arm.
