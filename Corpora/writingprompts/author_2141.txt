This isnt happening.This must be some sort of a joke Jack Lee said to himself.His windshield was still showing the smokey outline of the tree the car slammed into, together with the trickles of blood from the person laying on top of his murder instrument.It couldnt be a dream he continued then what kind of a sick reality show is this?Those whites maniacs must be on some sort of prank again.

Being on the foreign land made him so much more adaptable than whoever were still back on the mainland, but he was pretty certain he didnt adapt to fixing any kind of 18th crntury French style plumbing in New Orleans, being a welder for almost half a decade in California.And yet, right now, he could name each exact type of tool and the four sizes of pipe and the amount of connectors and sealant needed for fixing the rusted over pipeline in his house which had stopped working since Sunday.No, he concluded, this situation, whatever it was, must have been some sort of bad hallucinations.He kicked open the half cumbled door, trying to get out of the crappy 82 sedan he bought from a sleazy dealer.As he crumbled onto the ground, the smell of fresh blood snuck into his nose, alerting him that this was gonna be some bad trip.Regardless, his stomachs decided to empty out its content, creating a buddle of steam on the burnt asphalt mixed with car tyre.A flash of red and blue charged foward, alerting Jack Lee of the approaching officer.He tried to stand up, only to find his legs somehow spaghettified under his weight, while his head dropped like a bag of lead.He barely heard the officer voice; asking him or ordering him to stay on the ground like murderer he was, Jack wasnt sure.But he felt being lifted onto his feet and escorted to the hazy vehicle in white and black.He could feel being seated onto the passenger side, being asked for something else, hea not quite sure.His fingers reaches for his pocket like a programed robot, but nothing was there for him to reach.As the officer walked toward his banged up car, his mind finally solidified, and his heart immediately skipped a beat.On the dashboard, there was the face of the man lying atop his car.Its a criminal record of drug use, and the name Jack E. Smiths, and it listed the current known occupation as Plumber for Hammer Prowell Inc..How did this random officer have the exact warrant for the man Ive just crashed into? The thought clawed at Jack Lee.His eye dashed across the vehicle interior looking for answer.As if hearing his question, the officers tag dangled from the rear mirror: MacBorough, J.His eyed then locked on to the face of Officer Jack MacBorough, whose hand was holding Jack Leea driver license.And at that instance, the officers beaming gaze gave all the answer Lee needed.He may not have knwn how to fight, but he sure as hell knew how to not drive over people.He reached over to release the handbreak, his other hand pressing on the gas just as two 9mm bullet pierces the wind shield of the police vehicle.5 seconds.It was all it took.And yet, that 5 seconds felt like years, and pieces of glass rain onto Lee, while sound of discharged firearm pounded on his ears.After what must have been an eternity, a loud thud followed by a scream signalled the end of the harrowing experience.Shifting the gear into reverse, Lee hit the pedal again, and a sickly crunch ended the unearthly scream of pain and anguish.Almost immediately, loud thunderous drone of an invisible voice filled Lees head, not too dissimilar to the earlier voice of the officer:

Skill of driving: upgraded.Tackling driving skill tree unlocked.Skill of firearm: unlocked.Skill of explosive: unlocked.Skill of evidence tampering: unlocked.Skill of planned serial murder: unlocked.Skill of police protocol: unlocked.Skill of tracking: unlocked.Skill of investigation: unlocked.The shear amount of knowledge that bombarded Jacks brain would have made anyone mad.But for him, its as if he had been doing it for ages.As he pondered what sick machination was at play, his investigative skill kicked in: a small compartment was hidden right under the driving wheel.His curious hand immediately reached for the contraption, and pulled out a thick book of filing.Along the opening, multiple memo notes could be seen sticking out.As he read through the name, it dawned on him what his next move would have been.The note he opened up led to a profile.The name was centered and bold: Jack Bauer.
