James Bond had pried a little too far, gathering enemies powerful, and not so powerful.This one, is a powerful enemy.Bond sat in the car as he listened to the radio."Launching in sixty seconds."Bond sprang into action.He slipped one of the boots in the suit off his foot with a good shake, revealing the knife hidden within.He grabbed the knife with his toes, dexterously spun it around and cut away at the straps on his legs.Now that his legs were free, he kicked out the windshield in front of him with his fully booted foot.The glass showered around Bond, and a large shard fell conveniently next to his right hand.He grabbed it with his fingers, and began cutting at the bonds around his hands.With a hefty snap, Bond was free of the straps."Thirty seconds until launch."Bond opened the car'a driver door, and nearly fell onto the floor of the rocket.He jumped down to the floor, knife in hand.He then began probing for an exit.He did this so long he began to hear the launch countdown."T-10.9.8.-" he found a latch.He opened it, quickly unscrewing bolts keeping the patch in place.Inside the latch were electronic controls, labeled 'Rocket Override Controls' Bond quickly mashed the stop button."3.2.1.Liftoff."The rocket began to lurch upwards.Applause filled Bonds space helmet."Did you really think I would make it so easy to stop the rocket, Mr.Bond?"*Click*.The radio was silent.Bond tore open the false controls in anger, revealing wires upon wires.He slashed the wires open, stopping any electricity from going through."Wait, why did the camera feed go dark?"Elon Musk exclaimed quickly.A man burst into the room."We've lost control of the rocket."Elon blinked, and then went outside.The rocket was high in the air, but also leaning hard.When it seemed to be going sideways, Elon saw a dark parachute open in the bright sky."He escaped, but how?"Elon asked.
