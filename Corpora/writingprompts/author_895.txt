Once again, It just has to happen at awkward times like this.I was just munching away peacefully on my snacks when time itself stopped and now I have them in my mouth, partially chewed.The last time it happened it was in mid-poop.It was as if it was coincidentally made to put me in these difficult situations and I am not a fan of it.As usual, I would clean up and walk off to the  nearest park to take my mind off this problem that has been occuring over the past few years.I had a lot of fun initially.They were mainly minor pranks like wetting someone's socks and  snatching the ball away from dogs.I always giggled like a small school girl when time resumed back and see their mugs at the slight inconvenience that they face.This went on for a while, maybe like 50 times before it got annoying.I was bored out of my wits until that one fateful day when I got to meet Jennifer, a beautiful blonde bombshell who often visited the park.It is very obvious that she was out of my league.She had a beautiful figure that could make any girl green with envy.Her golden hair shimmered warmly in the sunlight.Her long eyelashes pitch black and it further accentuated her big, brown eyes.I could only look at her from afar and bask in her warm glow as a dude that looks like an overweight pitbull.There was no way that I could ask her out, even in my dreams but it is different now.I could stop the time, somewhat.It was when I first met her and desired her company that my powers could potentially be controlled.Almost every single time that I see her in the park near my house, time would stop for me.It was as if I was given a chance to interact with her, albiet in a creepy way.I would then make my way to her and you know, like any guy in love would do, would take a closer look at her and admire her beauty.Once again, before time has stopped, I saw her from my window in the park jogging with her best friend Stacy whom I have never seen without each other.I happily scurried my way there as usual and continued my routine.My definition of closely observing involved staying at least 100m away from her in a bush hidden from her view.I know time has stopped so I could do whatever I want but have you ever  experienced the awkward feeling of your crush literally crushing you with her speed when time continued?I couldn't even fathom about that time when she ran head first into me and boy did she run fast.Being the nice girl that she is, she immediately apologised to me and briefly resumed her running.So yeah, no more close up for me I guess.I was back to observing the picturesque scene of her mid-run when I was suddenly taken aback by a figure rustling in the bush opposite to mine.Out of the bush came a burly man with a huge knife that glistened in sunlight.*wait a damned second, how the hell is he moving?*

*..and why is he moving towards JENNIFER?!*

I was panicking as he trudged ever closer to Jennifer and  Stacy with a big ass knife.He was way too damn scary for me.*What can I do?!Somebody help them!*

My petrified body would not budge as my limbs buckled under my own weight.I could not even utter a cry for help as he lumbered over to Jennifer and her friend.Seething pain coursed through me as my gut feeling is telling me to stop him at once or I will regret it for the rest of my life.With the remaining ounce of strength, I made a mad dash towards the goliath.Out of the blue, Stacy and Jennifer continued their run.With puzzled looks on their faces, they turned to look at the monstrosity that is slowly approaching them.(Part 1)
