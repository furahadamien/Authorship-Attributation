Saying that it was like something out of a nightmare would be grossly...GROSSLY understating things.You die.Immediately after, you find yourself walking down an alley toward a rickety old movie theatre showing only one film.The usher in the box office looks strangely familiar, but he rushes you in through the lobby with a bored urgency before you can place him.And there you are.In a theatre full of you starting at yourself in disappointment.But each version of yourself is so different.Some are thin.Some are fat.Some are much older than your 36 years...Some much younger.You can swear as one of you shifts in a seat that you can see a toddler version of yourself in colonial garb.That's the other thing.There you are in go go boots with track marks up your arm.There you are in drag.There you are in a soldiers uniform."Go ahead and take a seat back here, please."The usher hands you a ticket.Instead of a seat number it simply reads, " Valid for 437 lives.No trades will be accepted."You look at the shabby velvet seat where the usher points.It's next to an immensely fat version of yourself.His flab spills over the armrest and into the space you know you must now occupy.He shifts himself uncomfortably over in an attempt to accommodate you.Warmth radiates from him as you slide into the seat."Can we get this going, please?"A call comes from the front of the theatre.The usher waves his hand at a mirrored glass window above.The lights dim, and as they do,

murmuring voices fill the room.The screen glows lightly red.You look at it for a moment but it remains for minutes, unchanging, that glowing slightly pulsing red.A teenage version of you with a red mohawk slinks out to the lobby.He returns moments later with an armful of popcorn bags and passes them out to several other pubescent versions of yourself."Figured it out yet?"asks a hot, breathless voice in your ear.The fat version of you leans toward you to whisper at you.He smells like stale onions."Are we...Dead?"You ask."Only, I think I remember being being hit--"


"--by a bus.Yeah.That's how they got you.A bunch of them pulled together to pay for that.Ended up costing a full hundred years, but it was worth it to them.Your life was particularly boring."You consider for a moment taking offense to this comment.But then it hits you.Your life was boring.You made it boring."The early childhood years were sad what with your parent's drinking problems, also such a clich, but you really overcame that (more's the pity, to become a successful, boring, well-rounded adult."Others were paying attention now, including a toddler, who toddled up the aisle toward the lobby."Seriously, dude," he added, "Only ever fucking ONE woman?What the hell was with that?I wanted to see some pussycat, and nothing for the past two years."You feel your face blush as agreeing comments titter from the seats around you, and the toddler shoots you a disgusted look as he pushes the heavy doors open to the lobby."I mean, one more pussy than I saw, dude," the fat you says, elbowing you.Comments of "don't remind us" and variations of "you're the worst" permeate the air."What does this mean?"You ask, holding up your ticket."That's how long you've got.Let me see?"He reaches out and pulls the ticket out of your limp fingers."Ah shit, dude.I'm sorry.You're in here almost as long as me!"He holds up his ticket and it reads " Valid for 698 lives.No trades will be accepted.""But what does it mean?"You ask again."That's how long we're here for.I'm here for 698 more lives.You were my second life.The first one drown in a pool.I started off at 800.They really hated me."He waves his hand at the surrounding room."Also you can't trade someone for their ticket.If you try, the numbers just change back to what you had before.See?"He shoves his grubby ticket into your hand, while keeping hold of his.The writing on the ticket changes in a blink of an eye to reflect his 437 lives.It also looked considerably less grubby all of a sudden."See?I'm sorry you've got so long.I voted for you to have the minimum 30 lives, but some people really didn't like you."An old, almost decrepit, version of yourself turns to face you."If you hadn't spent five years mourning your ex girlfriend Lisa, I would have been more lenient.But dear god, boy, there's only so much of that your audience can take!""But I didn't know I had an audience!"You reply."I gave him back points for burying his grandmother's ashes in the front garden of the house she grew up in, though..." Another you said."Yeah, but he waited three years to get around to it," came a call.The toddler came back into the room."Basically you're divisive in this group because you're so goddamn boring," he said, tearing at a stale redvine."But I lived a good life!I went to college!Married my college sweetheart!Paid taxes!"You exclaim.Realizing in one swift stroke how boring it would have been to watch you study your history homework.How dull it probably was to watch you painstakingly obsess over which color to paint the hallway bathroom.How many decisions had you lingered over?"At least I watched a lot of tv..." You offer, weakly.There's a general noise of agreement from the room."How many years did you get?"You ask the toddler."Thirty," he says casually."Im lucky.I died young and my parents cooked meth."He wanders back to his seat.
