The sky dampened.Slow roars of aircraft passing over the quiet Beverly Regional Airport drummed against the window of the apartment, leaving me to inch up the volume on my Walkman.It was tuned to the only radio station I could seem to find, which seemed to be playing alternative rock through a foggy haze of faint, blurry static.Two days ago I was escaping a rainy, freezing New York City - and the grips and trappings of an unglamorous but homeful Chinatown.Yesterday I was saying my goodbyes to my grandfather, whose clock ticks down yet to three months.Today I listed, quietly, in the apartment of my mother's parents, and prepared myself for loss.Unevent after unevent didn't happen, leaving me to dwell on my past.I was not well liked, and I was not well accepted.I dragged my feet every day for what must have been my whole life - yet only twenty years - until the last six months - when I resolved that I would, at least, lift them up high enough for them to not leave a mark anywhere.I did so by telling myself things would be better - that I could win.Six months later and I looked back, and I was no further than two paces from where I started.And so, today, I contemplated my life - and, as many times before, my death.Last week was a high point for me; today was the aftermath, like sweeping the pieces of a great, grand, beautiful explosion of life.No one told me that life left so much debris everywhere after the fact.Reddit was only a buffer and a distraction from what crippled my own legs - perhaps it was what caused it to begin with, but my connection to the internet has become an integral part of my life.I would be foolish - such as an alcoholic would be to suddenly stop drinking, or a smoker to suddenly stop smoking - to cut myself off.I never fit in anywhere - not even at *r/writingprompts.* My first conversation on the Discord server ended with an older user talking down to me.My second and final conversation ended with one of his peers *punching* down.And that was it.Most of my friendships, long and short, close and distant, ended like that.I joined *r/writingprompts* because the only thing that seemed to keep me alive was writing - even if no one would ever read it.I *desperately* wanted people to read it.I swore to myself that I would publish something before I died - even if that would be the death of me.Any time I looked past the moment I publish a book, or a novel, or a poem - every single time - I only saw blankness.Not the blankness of unknowing, like the Ghost of Christmas Future - but the blankness of death, like... the Ghost of Christmas Future.I didn't want anything else.I didn't want to live long enough to be accepted or criticized; I wanted to be remembered.Someone would hurt me, and I would not be remembered.I would hurt someone else, and still - because of my very nature - I would not be remembered.I have no legacy laid ahead of me, I thought, and it was true.The sky dampened.The air dried to a crispy, Massachusetts winter torrent outside.The lamp in this empty apartment, with everyone doing other things elsewhere, flickered.I laid down and thought for a while.In one swift motion, I instinctively glanced at my Reddit profile, checked my karma after my last lengthy comment post on *r/worldbuilding*, and my heart sank as it always did, a mooring that kept me trapped in this circular thinking.It was a feedback loop made of depression and intrusive thoughts, amplified by self-destruction and wishes of the void.Thoughts ran through my head which I had heard a million times before but stung me all the same.I heard the only noteworthy line from *Destiny 2* rattle in my head, given life to a new, perfected context:

*You started small.You will end small.*

And it was true.I read the top of *r/writingprompts*, and sighed arrogantly.*[WP] you are yourself, on Christmas Day, reading this on reddit, you are told that you are loved and accepted for who you are, and to have a happy holiday season, and a great new year!*

I stirred.*I wish.*

On the most cheerful day of the year, amidst the most cheerful thread of the subreddit, I sat still and quietly wondered to myself what would actually be the final straw that tipped me off the edge - and contemplated how much hope I had left to waste on thinking it wouldn't come sooner than expected.*Good night, Reddit*, I said softly.The sky dampened.
