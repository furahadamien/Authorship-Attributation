"Be ye wizard or God of old?"I stared blankly, looking into the face of a toothless, wizened hag, whose clothes hung off her frame in a ragged, baggy fashion.She stood with one arm out, placing her thin body between myself and a small toddler barely over the age of three."I," I began in a loud, booming voice."Am Merlin, the greatest wizard who ever was, or ever will be.""Be ye benevolent?"A younger man chimed in, waving his crudely shaped pitchfork in the air.He, unlike the crone, seemed eager to meet me, as did his younger sister, who strained to get a look of my unkempt face."Yes."I smiled, pulling a dehydrated food pack from a pocket."You seem hungry.Come over here, I won't bite.You have my word."The man walked over, jittery, as though he'd had a strong cup of coffee.*"Maybe I should give the little kids some,"* I thought jokingly."Do you have water?"I asked."Aye," the man replied, handing me a wooden bucket.A layer of algae coated the bucket's insides, home to some sort of insect, which swam in and out of the dense greenery.I retched slightly, disgusted.But no matter.It would suffice."Well," I said, grabbing more dehydrated food from my pack."I can conjure enough food to feed this village.But first, I need some wood and a very large pot.""Pot?"An elderly man wheezed at me, his face a picture of confusion."What dost thou mean by 'pot'?""Sorry," I replied smoothly."It's the magic word for cauldron.""I shall get that!"A boy, nearing ten, shouted excitedly next to me."It shall be my first quest.""Good."As the peasants piled wood, I pulled a lighter from my back pocket, then stuffed it into a nearby stack of wood.The kindling immediately caught flame, eliciting oohs and aahs from my ever growing crowd of spectators."How didst thou light the flame?Ye hadst neither flint nor iron!""Magic," I replied, wiggling my lighter.I clicked it on once more then breathed, sending a plume of flame into the air; I'd drunk a bit of vodka beforehand.The onlookers flinched back, cowering before my might."Half dragon, he is!"An old crone shouted into the air."And let it be known that Maggie hadst forecast the future!""Whoa, I want to be like him when I grow up," exclaimed a tiny child.As the crowd began to chatter, I pulled a small ball of weed from my sleeve, then slipped it into the fire.*"They'll thank me later.Or maybe they'll just go on one heck of a withdrawal."*

As the water neared boiling, I grabbed a ladle from some fat man in the crowd, then began pouring water into each of the packets.By eyeballing, I assumed the town had about 100 residents.And each packet had a serving size of three.*"Yeah.I definitely have enough to feed them.And then some,"* I thought, eyeing the chubby man who, in turn, stared back, piggy eyes flitting to his ladle."Alright!"I shouted loudly, having pulled a megaphone from my pack.The peasants shrunk back, cowed and afraid."Gather into groups of three.You'll have to share the food, but there'll be more than enough to go around."As the groups lined up, bowls at the ready, someone shouted "The king hath come!"Peasants began scrambling, hiding their gold.The fat man ran, his belly rippling violently.*"King,"* I thought, pulling out my pistol.*"I'll challenge him to single combat, then take the throne for myself."*

As the king approached, I hesitated.*"Wait...is that a WALKING DEAD t-shirt?"*  The king, in turn, stared at me, his eyes scanning my baggy denim jeans and 420 blaze it sweater."Bro," said the king, dismounting, wearing a smile on his face."You discovered time travelling too?!""Yeah," I replied, grinning ear to ear."So, what'd you tell them your name was?""Merlin.""Duuuudeee!"The king clapped his hands with glee."That's awesome!To them, I'm Arthur.But you, my dude, can call me Phil.""Sweet ride, by the way," I said, pointing to Phil's massive dirt bike."Yeah."Phil glanced tenderly at the bike."I just couldn't leave my baby..."

Phil trailed off, his nose flaring.He sniffed once.Twice."Yo, is that...is that weed?""Yeah man," I said grinning."I got some pre-workout to give to the little kids too.""Shit man, you got anymore?I haven't been high in forever!""Yeah," I replied, pulling out a couple of pre-rolled joints."Dude.Let's get high."***
