"Santa bunny ghost turkey!"ordered the leadiny, Easter."Oh ho ho" I replied, in their tongue "As you command."I wasn't really worried.Every year I have to deliver all around the world the toys they make.They give me a fast rocket - they made it in the shape of a sleigh and some reindeer in order to fool the people here.But that's all they force me to do, using their little nanobots to control me once a year.It's not so bad - the rest of the year I go hang out in one of my houses.These tiny warriors, really aliens from a far away planet, keep a watchful eye on the people of Earth - cameras in the toys.The warriors are paranoid that Earth people will discover the alien presence.They can't have that.They crash landed on Earth in 326 AD.Their ship was damaged, and it takes 2000 years in this yellow sun drenched atmosphere to generate a new galactic drive.So they hang out at the North Pole, sending out their spy toys once a year to make sure the earthlings don't know about the aliens.I boarded the sleigh.Some day, these aliens may connect the dots from their observations - humans don't live as long as I've been serving these little guys.I'm immortal, you see.Who knows what these guys will do if they find out about that.As the sleigh took off, one of the aliens, they call themselves Elves, shouted "4th of July armistice day!"- translated to English that's "have a safe journey".
