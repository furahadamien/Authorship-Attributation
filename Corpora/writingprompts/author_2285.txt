Hi.I'm Kayuto Kagama.In high school I was the one who was beat up for money until I stopped bringing it to school.They still beat me up but at least I wasn't losing money.I was the tech nerd back then and still am.In high school there was this girl named Akari who had a crush on me.She kinda stalked me and gave me chocolate every year for valentines.This never got annoying but I was bullied because she was the cutest girl in school and I was the nerd.Oh, I forgot to say that her father was one of the Yakuza higher ups.After high school I got a good job at a tech company in Fukuoka and didn't see her again... until now.I was at a bank cashing my paycheck when 8 guys held us at gunpoint."Let's check and see if anyone here is on the list."Said guy 1."Why should we do that?"Says guy 5."We don't want what happened to Kayuga happen to us."Said guy 7.3 of the guys started going around checking to see if anyone was on the list.When they got to me guy 4 said:"Hey guys.This guy is wanted by Akari, alive.We'd better take him to her.""Me?!"Said I."Yes you," says guy 6.They finished the robbery while everyone looked at me funny.After finishing and grabbing some coffee from the break room they put a bag over my head and shoved me into a car.The car ride was about 2 hours long and the seats were quite comfortable.The guys in the car were talking about previous robberies and stuff but I barely listened.We stopped and they took me out of the car.When they took the bag off of my head I saw that I was in a hangar.It was very clean and very white.I then saw a cute girl at a table."Akari?"I said."Yup that's me."Said Akari.Let me get something out of the way before I continue.Akari speaks kinda playfully.This may make her seem childish but she really isn't.She ran up to hug me and whispered in  my ear:"I've been waiting for you."Part 2 coming when I get 10 up votes on this.
