It's January 19th, 2038.For years, Susan had been working in secret on her time machine.Her goal?Not to kill Hitler.Not to stop Trump.Not to meet Jesus.Her goal is to make it so she can watch Netflix and download games on Steam without having to pay an extra premium.A noble, but petty goal, all things considered.She sets the time circuits to November 23rd, 2017.She sees this as the pivotal turning point -- Thanksgiving Day.The day that everyone in the United States is at home with their families, and most likely watching Football or the Macy's parade.When it will be easiest to get their attention.She thinks she has it all figured out.She's tested the machine a few times before to go backwards days and even weeks.This will be her biggest jump.Ironically, much like the original Delorean in Back to the Future her ship is fueled by raw plutonium.Also, ironically, thanks to the Trump regime (which has been in power for 20 years thanks to a military coup) she lives in a Libertarian utopia (by which I mean a dystopia) and you can buy plutonium at the corner drug store, just as Doc Brown joked about in Back to the Future.Anyway, enough about how great of a movie Back to the Future is.The amount of plutonium it depletes is based on how far into the past she travels.She's figured out the exact ratio needed for 2017.In order to be safe and not run out, she's purchased ten times the required amount.She has no plans of getting stranded like in some dumb TV show or movie.But she's made one specific error.One that would not have exposed itself until this very day, this very hour, this very minute, this very second.Somewhere in the hardware of her time machine, between the interface of the time circuits and the hardware that actually does the quantum calculation on how much fuel to use to bend time and space, there's a chip that takes a 64 bit integer and converts it to a 32 bit one if that number can losslessly be converted.This is an undocumented feature of the chip used to help it do calculations faster.An optimization created by a machine learning algorithm that creates most modern chips of her day.The impact of this bug is that her time machine is unknowingly affected by the Unix Epoch Bug.As the machine is warming up, the clock ticks over to 03:14:07 UTC.Instead of the time calculation being for -17 years, 1 month, 27 days, from January 19th, 2038, it gets calculated as -17 years, 1 month, 27 days from December 13th, 1901, also known as October 27th, 1884.And because she took ten times the required fuel, which would have enabled her to do ~200 years worth of time travel, the machine happily consumes 3/4 of her fuel to send her 154 years back in time, stranding her with only enough fuel to make it less than a third of the way back home.As the machine hums to life, nothing seems out of the ordinary to Susan.She's transferred all her data to a 20-year-old laptop so she'll be able to interface with older computers easily.She's brought what she hopes will be enough information to prove to people that not only is she from the future, but that net neutrality is the number one issue that people should be concerned about for the future.More important that global warming, ISIS, North Korea, the 2025 war with Russia, any of that.If only they'd had consistent download speeds, all of that could have been avoided and all those problems solved!Also at this time I'd like to point out that 21 years (2038 to 2017) is greater than two decades, not "almost two decades."Anyway, I digress.A flash and a sudden jolt later, and Susan is in 1884.She'd picked the location of her time jump knowing that it would be an empty field in 2017.But in 1884 it was a dense forest.It had not yet been cleared for a cow pasture.There was no Google Street View for her to reference that far back to confirm.There's a small explosion, several pops, and a burning smell as tree trunks around her burst outward as they're displaced in spacetime by her vehicle.A few seconds later, she hears creaking as the damaged trunks bend and break as the trees awkwardly fall around her.She nervously waits out the unexpected cataclysm, hoping it's over."What the fuck?"she demands, annoyed and frustrated.Then she looks at the time circuits."What the fuck.God damn it."*How did this happen?* she thinks to herself.*I took so many precautions.I tested it so many times.So many simulations.How the hell did this happen?* But unfortunately for her, because the chip I mentioned earlier was developed using machine learning, it was essentially a black box in her simulation.Whenever she had tested the chip, the inputs and outputs gave her the values she expected.When she simulated the chip, it was only simulated in terms of its expected inputs and outputs.And she'd never tested it when the current date was after the end of the Unix Epoch.She just hadn't considered it.She never intended to travel to the future, only the past.By 2037, nearly all modern computers and software had long ago been fixed to work around or account for the bug.It just wasn't something people thought about anymore.It seemed like a solved problem.She activated the augmented reality system that would allow her to look outside the vehicle quickly without leaving it, in order to assess if anything had been damaged.There were some tree trunks leaning on the vehicle and some dents, but overall it seemed to not have taken too much damage.The noise of her arrival also didn't seem to have attracted any unwanted attention.She checked her fuel gauge: slightly less than a quarter remaining.If she activated the ship now to go forward, she could barely make it to 1930.Not good enough.No one would even know what the internet was at that time!She sat and thought for a few more minutes.*What if I did something like, living one year normally, then traveling forward a year using the time machine?How far could I get that way?* 1976.Plus that would take up literally 46 years of her life, and put the time machine at risk of being stolen or breaking in the interim.And people would still barely know what the internet was!*What if I found more fuel?When was plutonium discovered anyway?Could I use an alternative fuel?Uranium maybe?* She opened her laptop and went to her offline copy of Wikipedia.*Good thing I paid my ISP for Wikipedia Premium service in order to quickly download the entire database before embarking on this trip.* she thought to herself.And then immediately admonished herself for thinking that way.*No!Fuck that!That's exactly the bullshit I came back to fight against!Fuck paying a premium just to have Wikipedia move faster than a 56k modem!Great.Now I'm pissed off again.* She vowed to herself that her mission must succeed!>Plutonium was first produced and isolated on December 14, 1940 by a deuteron bombardment of uranium-238 in the 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley.First neptunium-238 (half-life 2.1 days) was synthesized which subsequently beta-decayed to form this new element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 (half-life 87.7 years).Since uranium had been named after the planet Uranus and neptunium after the planet Neptune, element 94 was named after Pluto, which at the time was considered to be a planet as well.*Those idiots, still considering Pluto a planet.People in the past were so dumb.So, 1940.That's only ten years of my life wasted.I think that's do-able.* Then, hating herself for doing it, she brought up the article on Back to the Future.*1885.And I ended up in 1884.What a stupid coincidence.Well, almost-coincidence.Maybe it's not a coincidence and so much of my work has intersected with that movie because I accidentally leave some information in the past?Nah.It's got to be a coincidence.*

Anyway, I just wanted to make a 2038 Unix Epoch Bug joke.
