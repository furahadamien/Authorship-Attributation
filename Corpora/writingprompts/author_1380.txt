gapball
I have always felt pain.An emptiness.Like I was a hollow shell walking around with no host inside.For 25 years, this was my reality.Countless lonely nights of drug and alcohol abuse, always afraid.I was afraid in any social event that I would act out and either go to jail, ruin life-long relationships,  embarass myself, or annoy others.I have held onto my need tobe a good person for so long.And I've held on so tightly that if that need had breath it would have suffocated long ago.I was never a religious person but I always felt like by blood was soaked in sin waiting to just be carefree and not worry about other people's feelings and just live my life for me.But that's not what I wanted.I wanted so much to please that I shut myself out.And the darkness began to consume me more and more with self deprecating thoughts.I am not wanted.I will never be on the level of normal people.People will always step on me and I will never step on them back.I am an idiot.I am...we are, only temporary anyway.One night, after a lot of alcohol and a few pills, Decided it was over.I chugged as many bottles as I could from my cabinet while swallowing more and more pills until I passed out.It didn't take too long.What I didn't expect was to wake up.Freakish, long, gray fingers were waving in front of my face.I nearly pissed myself."Gapball!"The figure exclaimed.My vision cleared and I could see 4 mire figures standing around me.There was a weird light surrounding us.Oh, right.That was our sun.My name was Gapball, not John.The memories were rushing back.This was my true home all along.The life I had before, befire the darkness, before the uncertainty in myself, before the pain.It was back.I was home."How was your trip Gapball?"Asked Vashrah."Now that it's over" I pondered "I realize it wasn't so bad."
