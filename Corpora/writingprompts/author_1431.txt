"GAAAYY", Yelled Chad."Super homo, man", added Brad.Jesus seemed disappointed."What's the problem?"Jesus looked among all 14 of his apostles as they sit on one side of a very long table.Brad glared back at Jesus "You want us to take this bread as YOUR BODY?Christ, man, I thought we were just gonna get our munchies on.None of this gay talk about swallowing you.""Come on guys, this is a serious occasion, just go with it."beckoned Jesus.Chad stood up from his table "Lord, I didn't come here this stoned to listen to you tell us to down this loaf like it's hanging from your crotch.I thought we were gonna talk about how to KO that bitch Caesar."Jesus sighed."Guys, we never said we would harm Caesar.Why do you two always berate me like this every time?""Hear me out, bro.You did say 'Give to Caesar what is Caesars', right?Well I'm thinking we gotta give that guy a new asshole!"Exclaimed Chad.Brad nodded with approval."Foresure, bro.Gotta get all thunder and lightning on his ass.Mess him up so good chicks would rather bang a leper.""Nice, bro" Chad said with a fist bump.The rest of the apostles sat silently, watching this almost routine banter.Now Jesus got up "Listen you two, I don't mean to make this seem more important than it is.But I kind of don't expect to be around much longer and I have some things I gotta leave you with before I go."Brad put a hand on Jesus' shoulder."Jesus don't be a pussy, only thing you gotta leave us with is some serious ammunition and Chad and I can run things fine.Go all kaboom on them!""What?"said Jesus."KABOOOOOOM!!!!!"cried Brad and Chad with exploding hand gestures."No.No threatening or hurting anyone."Jesus said, as angry as a son of God could reasonably get."Don't make me call upon my father.""Which father?The one who can't even bone your mom?"remarked Chad."Or the one you keep talking about yet we never seem actually see?"said Brad."Face it dude, you're in denial.""DE-NIE-ULL.""And we're not even in Egypt.Israeli sad."Brad and Chad looked at each other with satisfaction at their punny roast on Christ.Jesus was finished."That's it.I'm sick of it.I'm sick of you.You two will never again be mentioned or remembered again if you keep this up.I just wanted a nice dinner and you two ruined it.It's disgusting.I'm tired of your antics.If you can't pipe down just...just leave."Chad shook his head, "Wow, I didn't know you could turn EVERYTHING into whine.Whatever, this sausage fest was lame anyway.No chicks or anything.Let's go Brad.""There were never going to be 'chicks'.That was never part of our mission"

Brad started motioning to the door."Well that didn't stop Simon and us from convincing these brothel girls great riches if they blew us."Simon looked up in panic."Uh that didn't happen."Chad looked surprised."Come on, you remember Becky from last week?""I don't know a Becky!"Simon cried."Yeah you do" said Chad."No I don't!""Do too!"screamed Brad and Chad as they headed toward the door."OUT YOU TWO!"Jesus said."Yeah yeah, we're leaving.But just know this.This is THE LAST supper we are ever having!!"Brad said."The LAAAAST!!!"added Chad.As Brad opened the door, Chad whispered to Judas on the way out "Beeteedubs, Jesus has you on the end cause he says you wreak of B.O."And with that the two left history forever...
