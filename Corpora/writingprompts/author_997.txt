It started off just as any other ordinary day would.Wake up, shower, eat breakfast, brush teeth, do some other miscellaneous things, for the most part in that order.After getting out of work, you see an email from Amazon; "There was an issue with one of your recent orders, please sign in to resolve these issues."It would explain why they had been late in shipping your order out.You sign in, only to see the ordinary Amazon webpage.While it does seem slightly off, the website address says Amazon.com, nothing funky about it.You're even signed in.You go to your recent orders, everything seems to be fine.The refurbished part you ordered still hasn't shipped yet.The shipping date has changed, but that is to be expected, considering that, if had it held true, it would have shipped out two days ago.You play some computer games, have some dinner, and decide to finish the audiobook you've been listening to before heading off to bed.The next morning you leave for work and top up your gas tank since you were running below 1/4 of a tank and had read a few days ago that running your gas low can cause your fuel pump to wear out early since it relies on the gasoline as a coolant.While at work you get a notification from your bank that they suspect that some of the charges on your cards are fraudulent.Sure enough, they are.One $10 charge had gone through to an Indian company you don't recognize.You refund the money and cancel the card.Googling the name of the company, you see that it is a real company, although not a brick and mortar one.After doing some very in-depth research, you find that it is a front, for a front, for a front of an another company that, you discover, has been laundering money through stolen bank accounts.Of course bringing legal action against this company is impossible.Or... Is it...Doing a little bit of research, you discover that it is possible to bring legal action against the company, just not easy.Considering that you feel that there really isn't anyone else who knows what this company is up to, you look at some lawyers.Most refuse to take on the case, but you did find one.You discuss fees and other payments with him.He will take on the case, but there is a fee since there is a low chance of succeeding, however, he promises millions.His slick tongue slings silvery syllables composing several silliloquoys of grandeur in your direction, and before your even realized it, you had signed the papers.Ten Grand and ten dollars down the drain.You hope what he said was right.Months pass and very little else turns up.The fees rack up, not in big bills, but $100 in fees here, and $100 in fees there cause the lawyer's cost to skyrocket to well over 30 Grand.Each additional fee was like pulling a fingernail off, yet each time you were terrified to call it off since doing so would guarantee you never saw any of the money you already spent back in your bank account.The day of the trial edges nearer, and the news of the trial blows up.This was not a small company, and stock prices have already dropped 15% and are expected to continue to drop since several investors have pulled out.The trial starts, and could almost immediately have been considered a loss.Your lawyer had done practically nothing aside from writing you bills for the paper he wrote bills for you on.The company's lawyers point out every minute flaw in your case within minutes.The typos in business names, the fact that one of those typos led you to the wrong company (darn not understanding any foreign languages!), the fact that it wasn't the Amazon email that you thought was a Phish, but rather that your credit card was skimmed while you were at the gas station.If this trial was to be considered a pizza delivery, you'd be handed the works, extra large.Not only that, but your lawyer doesn't even seem to care one bit.Why would he?His firm has been publicized, who cares if he wins or loses?He's already been paid.Not no mention the company plans to counter-sue for defamation.You've been ruined.What was to be a an interesting dip into international law has become your undoing.You now know why all the other lawyers didn't even look at your case after you mentioned the words "scammed" and "Indian".
