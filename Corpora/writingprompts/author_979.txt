It awoke.The past 2 awakenings had been bad.Those children nearly killed It.They had driven It into the outer darkness from whence It came.But It was tied to the land now, after all these millenia, and death of Its physical form wouldn't keep It at bay forever.It was so weak, and needed to feed.First insects.The tiny neuron bursts as it ripped their legs and wings off gave It strength, but It was like drops of water to a man dying in the desert.Next, came the rats.They had a weak fear that It was able to eat, but they, and the cat he managed to lure into the sewer, only whetted his appetite.It needed something that could truly understand what It was.Finally, It was ready to go after its favorite prey.The giant creatures that had walked the earth had been good eating, but were too slow and stupid to truly enjoy.It had bided its time for countless ages, waiting waiting for sentience.Waiting for a consciousness that could truly know It for what It was.Know It, and fear.All the better that the tastiest meals had no claws, or sharp teeth, nor a powerful Shine to defend themselves with.It slunk through the sewers with a fluid grace; part of the shadows themselves.It sensed something in this part of the sewer.Not rats, nor some other large animal that decided to make this its home.No, these things had thoughts.It could sense them.Smell them like a man would smell freshed baked bread.This thing was underdeveloped.The immature mind made it all the sweeter.Maybe a little older than the truly young that It liked to prey upon, but It was capable of taking down creatures great and small.It formed a body from the Void that was Its domain, and crept closer 

Psst.Hey kid It whispered.The thing turned around.It wasn't like anything It had ever seen before.A green face, looking like something from days long past, when giant reptiles roamed Its domain.But this thing this thing walked on two legs like men, and was wearing a long brown coat to cover its body.Strange, indeed, but It had never seen a thing It couldn't eat, and It was HUNGRY.Forming words and images stolen straight from the creatures mind, It set the trap.Hey, Mikey!I was supposed to deliver a pizza down here, but I can't find who it belongs to.Do you want it?

Free pizza?Radical! The thing had a sense of trust that It found delicious.Trust betrayed created a fear so sweet, it was hard to think of anything else.Sure, Mikey.An extra-extra-large supreme with triple cheese, hold the anchovies.Come get it.All you want...

Awesome! The creature came over, but slowed.It could sense a small, but growing suspicion in the thing.Wait a second How did a pizza delivery guy get in the sewer? Pondered the green thing.It searched the creature's surface thoughts for an explanation.Fast Eddy's Pizza opened a new store down here.Don't you want your pizza?Come oooon.It's getting coooold. it crooned

This seemed to make up its mind, and it reached into the shadows to grab the box.In a flash, It grabbed for the things arm.Only to grab air?In an instant, several things happened at once.It tried to attack the creature's Shine, to drive its fear up into terror.A creature panicked was always easy prey.It's attack, however, bounced off of something.Like its shine was protected by... a shell?At the same time, Its hand was wrapped up in a strange device: two sticks connected by a chain locked Its hand.It pulled back with all the strength that Its corporeal form could muster, but this thing was STRONG!It pulled back with equal force.Nothing was stronger than It when It wanted to be, though.It added muscle and power to Its arm, and prepared to yank the creature into Its mouth, when out of the darkness, a blade flashed.Its arm came loose, severed at the shoulder.It gave a scream of rage, as 3 more of the creatures materialized out of the darkness, all carrying primitive weapons.Foolish creatures! It spat.You dare to hunt me?The eater of worlds?The hunter of hunters?I will devour your souls, and digest them for centuries to come!

The one with a red mask replied.Yeah, yeah.Great and terrible.We've heard it before.You've been creeping around our sewers for too long already.Enough with the threats, let's make with the fighting.It began to change forms, cycling though from fear to fear.These creatures were too quick, though.Whenever It would turn to attack one, the other 3 would attack It from behind.They always seemed to be open to an attack, but they were never where It expected them to be when It hit.It gave a roar of frustration.It was too weak to overpower these things until It had fed more deeply.It began to shift back to the Void, to come up with a plan to destroy these foul things, when a fifth creature came into Its view.It was like the rats that It had eaten, but large, and it walked like a man.The creature's Shine was strong.Too strong!The thing threw salt in Its face and shouted worlds in a language It had not heard before.Akujin!Watashi wa anata o kono basho ni shibaru! The salt burned like fire, and the words rang through It like a great bell had sounded.Suddenly, It was stuck in this realm.It could sense the Void, but it was like a pane of glass had been placed between It and the Void.No nononono! It screamed.What are you foul creatures!? 

The one in the orange mask stopped and said We're teenagers!

The one in red spun his weapons and said We're mutants

The one in purple crouched low with its stick and said We're ninjas

The one in blue smiled and shouted We're TUUURTLLLEEES!

Turtles!And a Rat!It could see now.Maturin finally had It cornered.It fought savagely, melting into Its true form, an unspeakable thing of legs, claws, teeth and eyes.Spider and serpent, and other unholy things combined onto an abominable killing machine.Its rage fuelled It, but the turtles were too much for It.They were as much a part of the shadows as It was; born to the fight, and working together as only brothers could.As It lay, broken and bleeding the foul ichor that served as Its blood, the rat walked up to It in a stately manner.Demon, if I sent you back to where you came from, you'd only come again.So here you will remain.And your death will not be an honorable one. His walking stick, carved with unusual ideographs, blazed with light as he drove the point through Its head.Master Splinter Michelangelo said Can we get some pizza now?Being monster bait makes me hungry!.Splinter smiled and replied calmly Michelangelo, everything makes you hungry.Now lets go call Fast Eddy's.I want one with cheese.
The four brothers jumped into the air with a shout of Cowabunga! and they raced off towards home.

*This isn't exactly following the writing prompt, but it's what my imagination spat out* 

They killed Necroblighter The old man said.Yep his friend replied after taking a sip of iced tea.I heard from my granddaughter.They staked him down and let him burn to death in the sunlight.Bad way to go.

It's all these danged upstarts.They don't even call themselves heroes anymore.Now everybody's got to be an 'antihero', and be dark and brooding.It's not just these new heroes.The villains too.They're nothing like they once were.We had a code.We might take over the world, or steal millions, but we had basic decency.You remember what that monster last year did to all those kids.The league of villains would have never stood for that back in our day.And while I'm at it, what kind of silly name is 'Necroblighter'?The old villains, they had some good names.'Zebulax'.That's a name that makes you afraid.Makes you wonder what he can do. 

The two old men sat in their rocking chairs on the front porch of the sprawling house, lost in old times.After long minutes of reverie, the old man's friend spoke again.You know it was folks like Captain Amazing that kept us in line.No matter how many times he caught us, he never treated us badly.Always believed we could be reformed.I guess having someone believe in us gave us some faith in ourselves, even if it was only a little bit.

There is no Captain Amazing anymore the old man said.just some old geezer with a suit that doesn't fit, arthritic knees, and no pension.I always said crime didn't pay, but I never realized that selflessness doesn't get you too much either.Every time somebody offered me a reward, I'd turn it down.

The old man's friend grimaced.tweren't right of the city.Use you for 30 good years, and then put you out to pasture with a key to the city made of fake gold.'twern't right.

Captain Amazing sighed; I guess they got so used to me turning down rewards they never thought about it.It's you guys who really remembered us in the end.You're a good friend, Zeb 

Zebulax shrugged.well what else could we do.I know you've saved every one of us from certain death countless times.Remember our fight on the top of Dead Man's Cliff?I slipped on those rocks, and you jumped over the cliff to save me, even after I had tried to kill you.Never thought twice about it.I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.Besides, our crime really did pay.We can afford it.

The Captain stared into the distance, watching the sun set.When dark had come, he stood up.Well, he said with a stretch, I guess I'll turn in early.Mindmaiden had another vision last night.There's a little boy that's going to get lost tomorrow on his way to school.If nobody helps him, he'll end up in a bad way.I reckon a couple of the boys and me will go down and help him out.

Zebulax drained his iced tea and stood up with Captain Amazing.Mind if I come along, Cap?Sounds like it might be fun. 

The Captain grinned faintly in the dark as they walked back into the League of Villains Retirement Home; sure Zeb.I'd like that a lot.
