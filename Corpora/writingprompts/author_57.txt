"Tell me, Mr.Bond - have you ever had your fortune told?""No, Mr. Musk - I prefer to make my own fortunes.""Then you may not have encountered the Sulk Omen before.Allow me to enlighten you."Elon Musk took a single card from his breast pocket and placed it face down on the table in front of Bond.He motioned for Bond to flip the card over.Bond did so, revealing a hideous, skeletal character.There was something familiar about the pointed cheekbones and wide, grinning mouth, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it."Bit of an unsightly chap, isn't he?""The Sulk Omen, Mr.Bond, is what some might call a God amongst men.He shows up throughout history, if you look hard enough, wherever there is human suffering, woe, and calamity.""Mr. Musk, if you're going to kill me, I'd appreciate if you'd get on with it.""Oh, I'm getting to that.In Ancient Egypt, they told tales of a spectral creature called Skelumon, who once crouched at the banks of the Nile and drank it dry, causing a seven year famine.After the Crusades, the surviving Moors spoke of a savage character named Monk Ules, infamous for drenching his victims in caustic holy water.And you will have heard of Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb.But it's a well-guarded secret that all of his ideas came from the contributions of a mysterious lab assistant, Ms.Lo Nuke.""Forgive me, Mr. Musk, but how do the antics of a mythical, time-traveling lunatic affect our current situation?""Think, Mr.Bond.If there's one characteristic that defines humans, it's shortsightedness.The Sulk Omen has gained a reputation for suffering, but this is only because you are incapable of seeing the complete chain of events.Human beings are wonderful progenitors of ideas, but they're awful judges of consequence.You see an atomic bomb and think death and destruction; I see an end to a seemingly insurmountable conflict.You see the Black Death and think of endless misery; I see an effective solution to overpopulation.Is this making more sense, now, Mr.Bond?I know your organization sent you here to thwart my company's progress.I know they would rather I use my research to save this world, rather than take a select few to colonize another.And I could - yes, I could apply my terraforming technology to extract the carbon from the Earth's atmosphere.Buy the population another few hundred years, perhaps.But I choose not to.Human beings are a cancer upon their homeland.A parasite.A pest.Your world is a sinking ship.I am in a position to save it, but instead I choose to forsake it, for the greater good of your species.Sometimes, however painful it may be, a fresh start is necessary.This is no different from before.Throughout history, there have been times when the course of humanity has needed a little..."

 Elon paused for effect."*Rearranging*."
