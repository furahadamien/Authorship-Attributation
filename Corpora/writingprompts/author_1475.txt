Lou smiled beatifically at his hydroponic garden.Tomorrow he would harvest some leaves and dry them in the shed.He had a fresh supply of papers for his rolling machine.He took out his cigarette case- a glorious antique over a century old.He stroked its chrome finish possessively as he left the basement.As he went up the stairs he grabbed a box of prop cigarettes- for use in stage and trid productions.It was one of the many antique style props he created as part of his business.The trid was on and he winced.He had it on for music but the  damned house AI switched it to the news- if MS Global Info could be called news."Computer, off!"he shouted, but it was too late.These days you could no  longer mute the ads.You could no longer fast forward through them.You could only endure them.And as AIs targeted each viewer with such precision, enduring became harder and harder.Lou had the most sanctimonious jerks in the world targeting him."Louis Warren, your interest in history, in these antiques have made you lose sight of the present!"sneered woman in the hologram.He tried to walk past her.The AI continually projected her in his path as he walked through the kitchen."Smoking is a filthy degenerate relic, like racism, sexism, homophobia, contact sports and transfats!You should be ashamed to be such a dinosaur!"Lou opened his case and pulled out a cigarette.It was a real one, of course."Is this a two-way communication, lady and not a recording?""Yes, Lou, it is.I want to counsel you and.."  She paused as Lou turned around to face the wall.She waited.It had taken considerable effort and resources to access his home AI, but if she could reach him, it would be worth the legally questionable effort.Lou turned around.The cigarette was in between the ring and index fingers of his right fist, pointing straight up.He brandished it at her in mock obscenity.Then he took the cigarette and placed it in his mouth.The Zippo lighter was another one of his functional antiques.The Playboy Bunny on it was chipped and faded, but the lighter itself still worked.Lou flicked it to life in a single gesture.Slowly, theatrically, he brought the flame to the cylinder in his jaws.He inhaled deeply, several times.When he exhaled the enormous cloud of smoke at the hologram, the woman twisted her face and body in revulsion.She could almost imagine the smell.Lou gave the hologram a grin of savage satisfaction."Now get the FUCK out of my AI!""For now," came the reply and an ad for dental floss appeared in her stead.
