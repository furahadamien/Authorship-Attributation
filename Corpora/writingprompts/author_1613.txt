Surrounded by your family  family, you feel yourself fading.From the edge of your bed, you see your parents, siblings, and even pets welcoming you into the unknown void.You see your son trying to compose himself.He says something, but you can't quite catch it.You think it might've been "I love you dad."Slowly your senses fail.You think to yourself " a live well lived" as  you let our your last breath and close your eyes....

Only to open them back up and gasping to fill your lungs with air.Your inhale tastes unfamiliar.Fresher almost.Wait?Why are you paying attention to your inhale?Wait what's this sound I'm hearing?You turn your head, climb down, and circle the tree looking for its source.I know I heard somethin- there it is again!Strange but where am I?You suddenly feel that familiar bodily urge, so you squat down and relieve yourself.Wait....weren't things different down there?There's that sound!Your mouth feels dry so you ignore it and walk to the nearby stream.You lean over to drink and you see her.A lady in the water.She's not moving.Just staring.Wait what's she looking at?You turn around but no one's behind you so you turn back around to drink, lean over... there she is again!You freeze.The lady in the water freezes to.You lift a hair palm up.The lady lifts her palm up to.Why does she keep copying me?Wait..what's a "me" and where does that voice keep coming from?You've never heard it before.If you wanted water, you drank.If you belly growled, you ate from the trees or soil.The lady in the water hasn't let her hand down.You haven't either.You tun your head to look and see that the lady does too.Is the lady in the water me?Is the sound also me?You see another of your kind stroll over to the water, lean down, and drink.He doesn't see the man in the water looking at him.The water man looks just like.. is the man in the water the same man I'm looking at?I  babble at him and point at the water man.He sees him, gets angry, screeches, and swipes at him.Why is he attacking himself?Doesn't he even know that's him?
