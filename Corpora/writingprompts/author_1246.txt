I scroll through my Reddit home page on my app, and stumble upon a post for r/writingprompts.It catches my eye quickly, as I expect something juicy for Christmas Day.Only to see that the prompt is some meta well-wishing post for the holiday season."K," The single letter comes automatically to my lips, accompanying a short bout of shrugging."Thanks, I guess."It isn't an unfamiliar statement for me: 'you are loved and accepted'.I am sure to other people that the words are often desired and sought after, words that are not often told to them or not by the people they want to hear them from.But after 18 years of being told this phrase in all of its different forms the words are just that - words.It isn't that I have intend on having the worst holiday season ever, it's just that the words hold no substantial meaning for me anymore.I still appreciate the gesture nonetheless, though the words are hollow, scrolling to read everyone else's answer.The thread seems to be nothing but a bundle of positivity and joy, and I am no doubt one souring note.I shrug yet again; I am used to being so.But even if the words mean next to nothing more me, I do not wish to detract from anyone else's holiday.I offer the same well wishes from the prompt to any reader.Happy Holidays.
