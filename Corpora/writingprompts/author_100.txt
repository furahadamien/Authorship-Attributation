It was a relatively boring life I'd had.Go to school, graduate.Go to  high school, graduate.A pretty average life as far as things went, until I was about ready to go to college.Really the only interesting thing I ever did was paint, and even then I wasn't very good at it.I'd woken up that day, with just a few things left to pack into my car.Later that day, I was rushed to hospital after having an aneurism, and later that same day, lying on a hospital bed, wrapped in nothing but a thin gown, I was declared dead.It wasn't fair, you know?Just when I thought things were going to get interesting for once in my life, I died.I thought it was the universe's way of telling me I should have done more.Maybe I should have.As soon as I'd given up the ghost, I felt myself dissipating into pieces, consciousness scattering and stars rusing past my fragmented 'vision'.I couldn't really see anything, just feel it.I felt incredibly, incredibly small.With nothing but a whisper, my vision blotted into reality, outside the entrance to a cinema.There was nobody else barring a greeter, and the lights spilled out into the foggy street.All the other buildings were closed up, lights off, and the fog prevented me seeing clearly beyond 20 feet."Ah, welcome," called the greeter.Confused and rattled, I cautiously walked over."What is this?""This," he replied, "...this is your cinema.Admission is free, You're in theatre 3."I took the ticket he handed me, staring at the incomprehensble language on it, only the number 3 was something I could understand.I walked past the other theatres, hearing some assorted sounds: talking, howling, the like."Theatre three..." I mumbled."This is ridiculous.I'm dead."I sighed and opened the doors, hearing some chattering turn to a hush.'Here he comes' being something I picked out in a loud whisper.I rounded the corner into the theatre, expecting to see a crowd of people staring at me.Instead, the rows were filled with...animals, none of them looking at me.Dogs, cats, a bear, and in the silence I'm sure I heard the whine of a mosquito."What the fuck is this, a zoo?""Shh, the next one is starting soon," said the bear."No, I'm not gonna 'shh'.You're going to tell me what on Earth is going on here.""Ugh, fine, but you're not going to like it," replied a fox, turning towards me and frowning."We're your past lives, man.You died and so you're in with us now.""Why are my past lives all animals?Why is there a mosquito in here?Is there any human in here?""Look buddy, we're trying to game the system.Your first life was a human and he was, well...not the best starter.Got some good achievements, but fucked up our karma something ridiculous.We got demoted to Leonard over here, the mozzie.""Where's he?Where's the first one?""Not important.What's important is that we've been trying to roll a human for a while now, but our karma hasn't been good enough," interrupted the bear."We spent ages trying to claw our way back, and for the second time it was a toral disappointment, so we voted you off.""Sorry," yapped the fox."but you just weren't cutting it when it came to XP.Besides.Art school?Lame.""You killed me because I wasn't interesting enough?""Yip.""Fuck you!Give me my life back!""Not possible.Sorry pal.But hey, you get to help pick what we'll be next.Too bad you were so shit at being an XP farm we couldn't unlock anything mythical for the next life, but at least your karma was alright.""Do you do this all the time?Just roast all the new 'lives'?""Yeah, Hubert, dolphin over there, died from trying to screw a sunk boat and got stuck.""Shut up, fuzzball, you don't know me!"shouted the dolphin."You know what?I'm not taking part in this.You guys suck.""Wait, just wait -- if you help us with this last one, we'll have enough to get something great, and then you can go.""Why?Why do you need to grind to unlock different things?""Well," starts a voice from underneath the floorboards."The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes.As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch.Among other things, we're looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis, and we'll be making constant adjustments to ensure that players have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via gameplay.We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.Our team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.""Who the fuck was that?""The other human."
