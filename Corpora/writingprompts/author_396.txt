It was a typical night in LA.People getting piss all drunk and underage people trying to get into the club, my club.I always laughed at the smugness of some of them.Always compensating with false confidence, it was kind of pathetic.15 years and a perfect record for keeping out underage guests and they still tried every night.Almost like they had something to prove.This night however was about to get strange.I had just turned away a couple of probably seniors trying to celebrate graduation early when he walked up.Clean with a perfectly tailored suit that looked more expensive than anything I could afford with strikingly blue eyes like daggers of ice.His face terrified me.His sunken cheeks and sharp jaw really made him look threatening but the most terrifying part was his age.8590.After a few seconds he spoke, his voice a flawless British accent."Are you going to let me into my club?"He spoke with a perfect smile."Yes, of course."I replied snapping out of my haze.His club?He couldn't be serious, right?The next night came and again he came; just as tailored as last night.This time he had a woman with him.I recognised her from somewhere but couldn't place it."Evening, I have a plus one tonight."He spoke cheerfully."Of course, sir."Who is this guy?A few hours later both him and the woman exited the club and we're having a conversation on the sidewalk.He was flipping a coin, no spinning.He was spinning a coin as it floated above his palm.Floated.Then it all went to shit.A car came by with loud rap music playing, a man pulled a gun and began firing on the man and the his guest and then was broadsides by a semi in the intersection.The police arrived and questioned everyone.One of the detectives walked up to the apparently new owner of the club at the piano."Lucifer Morningstar?"She questioned stifling a laugh."The one and only."He replied.That, can't be.He can't actually be.He'd have to older.A few moments passed and he walked up to me and said."They only count years I've been on Earth."And walked off.
