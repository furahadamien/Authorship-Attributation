Well, the first thing I remember is growing up in the metal concrete place.There were people, but they were different than you.They all wore uniforms and kept us all on a very strict regimen.I remember Treat Guy though.He was nice.Every day he would come and play with my litter-mates and me.He would teach us all sorts of fun games and give us tasty treats if we played right.When we got bigger he would bring in Puffyman.When Treat Guy made the special noise we got to knock down Puffyman and try to rip his arms off.It was a very regular routine like that, until one day in our second winter.Treat Guy and some other men took my litter-mates and I down to a part of the concrete den we hadn't been to, and put us into a little room.It stunk of cleaning chemicals and old blood.We quickly got excited and starting barking and howling.What fun new game was this?Then another door opened up into another room, smooth and square with a drain in the middle, and the stench of fear coming from a man huddled in the corner, staring at us with wild eyes.He wasn't dressed like the others, he just wore a simple jumpsuit and no shoes.Treat Guy and some other men watched from behind metal bars.We all looked to Treat Guy, listening for his commands with ears perked.We ignored the terrified mewling man, like we were trained, and you could smell our excitement as we waited anxiously.Then he made the special noise.The one he made when he wanted us to knock down Puffyman.We looked at Scaredguy.He had soiled himself and was making a lot of loud mewling noises.He wasn't Puffyman, he was different.We looked back at Treat Guy.He made the sound again, and pointed at Scaredguy.Now we understood, and, working together, we quickly had Scaredguy surrounded.He took a defensive posture, but it didn't do him much good as two of my sisters and I leapt on him in unison.As my teeth sunk into his arm we brought him down quickly, and the rest of my litter-mates leapt on him as Treat Guy shouted encouragement.But it was immediately clear that this was very different from playing with Puffyman.My mouth was full of blood, not my own, and Scaredguy was making a terrible desperate screaming noise we had never heard before.I let go of his arm and backed away.When we knocked down Puffyman he made similar noises, but they were a poor imitation of what we were hearing now, and Puffyman never bled.I licked the blood off my muzzle and my stomach growled.We hadn't been fed today.As Scaredguy flailed and my litter-mates tore into his flesh I looked around.One of my brothers was backed into a corner of the little room we came out of, scared, and one of my sisters was backing away from the bloody chaos with the same smell of uncertainty I had.The rest, though, continued ripping apart Scaredguy as the other humans watched through the bars.Before long Scaredguy's screams grew quieter, into gasping little howls.He fell completely silent when my sister sank her teeth into his throat.Within a minute he had fallen still and a smell I did not recognize at the time filled the room.I know the smell now.Death.Not the smell of a carcass, but the smell of death itself.Moments later the smell was gone.My sister and I backed into the small room to protect our brother, while the rest started to feed.My stomach growled again, but there was no way I could eat Scaredguy.I don't think he wanted to play with us like that.(More to come!I'm writing this on my phone, so I'm breaking it up into parts.By the way, OP, what's the name and sex of your beloved shep?)
