1.It was 2:30 AM.Kurt tore open a ramen pack and chewed the noodles raw (not exactly, since ramen noodles were cooked before packed).He was so hungry he couldn't sleep.The crunchy ramen calmed his stomach somehow.It would have to do.Kurt looked at his phone: 2:38 AM.If he were to wake up at 5:25 AM, he would have 2 hours and 47 minutes of sleep.5:25?Was that too early?Kurt changed the alarm to 5:30.Then, he added another 5:35 just to be sure.It was 2:40 then.He went back to bed, the thin blanket couldn't keep away the cold.He would fix the window tomorrow, he thought.His stomach grumbled once more, Kurt tried to force his mind into rest.2.Another failed job interview.Kurt thought his portfolio was good enough.It wasn't.He kicked the trash can slightly, even the rage was no longer there.He shouldn't have applied for an Arts Major, he contemplated.The night light was beginning to replace the sun, Kurt sat down on the pavement.He watched a homeless man across the street gorging down on a grocery store sandwhich.Some kind stranger must have given him that.It didn't matter anymore, he thought.He wanted a sandwhich.He wanted anything rather than instant noodles.His stomach grumbled.Kurt sighed, walking the dim road back to his flat.Noodles again.3.Kurt threw the phone on the mattress.His mother called, again, telling him to return home.She'd got a point, he hadn't had a decent job in 3 months.His father no longer spoke to him.He wanted Kurt to study something 'useful', like law or medicine.Now, unless Kurt apologized face-to-face to his old man, the two would never reconcile.Kurt grinned bitterly at the thought.If he returned, he would never leave.They would never let him leave.His stomach called.It wanted a meal.Kurt boiled the water.He could have studied law, or medicine.Instead he chose to believe in some old friends who he didn't even keep contact, who told him that his doodles were nice.'Nice', what a vague word.But it sailed the ship of his hope, a hope to be an artist.A false hope.4.There was no more instant noodles in the cabinet.Kurt searched around his pocket.There was some money left, but not much.He needed them for emergency.Wasn't starving an emergency, he thought.He needed to have enough cash to get back home.Why did he want to get back home?He didn't.But it was better to be safe than sorry.Kurt lied on the floor, his thought wandered about on how to survive another day.Picked up his kit, went out drawing portraits?People spend more money on street musicians than street painters.Maybe he should call Travis for that job.No, no, no!Travis always wanted him to illustrate for some fanservice comic.They didn't care about the facial details he meticulously put on, they only cared about bigger boobs and booty.But Travis paid well.Never!After working for Travis, Kurt's style was severely affected.And he certainly didn't want to experience that again.Kurt picked up his kit and went out.It was snowing outside, and his clothes were only half of what they used to be.5.He was a nobody.Kurt held the portfolio in his hands, shaking from the cold and the hunger.It was so embarrassing, his interviewer even offered half of her lunch to him.He was still hungry now, but at least it didn't show on his face.He didn't get the job.Kurt used to believe, with all his heart, against all that life threw at him, that he had some talent.But he didn't think so anymore, he couldn't even lie to himself anymore.He was a nobody.He sucked.Maybe he should come back home.Kurt sighed.There was still the college debt.6.Kurt found himself following the trail of the homeless to the Church.He hadn't eaten in two days.Charity meals seemed like a choice.But he couldn't bring himself to stand in line.Perhaps it was his vanity, perhaps he thought he could never get back up if he fell so low, but Kurt just loitered around the site until one of the servers called out to him.He quickly ran away, a faint sorrow bubbling up inside.He must have looked like a homeless.7.It was time to go home, to leave all that mirage of a dream behind.Kurt went over his stuff, he still hadn't used up his painting tools.He sighed.Better left the dream there.Kurt went over to the park, decided to paint the last of the false hope away.He set up the easel and the canvas.But what should he draw?The trees?The animals?The scenery?The people?He picked the first scene he saw, tired of being plagued by the artist's indecision.It was a girl on a bench.8.The girl left before Kurt could finish his painting.He wished to call out to her, to tell her to sit tight until he was done, but he had neither the courage or the strength.Being left with a unfulfilled feeling, he came home only to get a text from a friend.There was going to be an art competition in a few weeks.It's a small prize, but decent publicity.And decent recognition was what he needed.'How foolish', he sneered, counting the money for the trip home.His city story was over.9.Kurt stared at the terrible mistake he had made.The money was supposed to be for him to come home.Why, then, did he just storm out in the middle of the night for some cups of instant noodles and oil paint?Great.He was gonna use up the old painting set, but now he got to finish the new set too.10.Kurt returned to the park.If she showed up, he would finish the canvas.If she didn't, well, then she didn't.And he waited, his hands shaking with anticipation, half wishing that she would come, half wishing that she wouldn't.11.3:00 PM.She sat down on the same bench.Kurt began to paint.He had never felt this way before, as if an old flame was rekindled.His hands danced around the canvas, layers upon layers of colour overlapped each other into a symphony.She was a slender girl, black of hair and faint of lips.She was not incredibly beautiful, but held a charm that only got better over time, like wine or cheese.In her eyebrows lied a mystifying aura of secrets, her sharp eyes boasted the curious look of a child.A never-ending mystery, that's what Kurt would said about the girl.She was something fragile yet eternal, delicate yet strong, something that you would spend your whole life chasing after knowing you would never get her.12.She once again left before Kurt could finish.In a way, he wished for that, wished for the heat inside his soul to go on burning.Kurt called Travis that night.He knew, whatever ridiculous job Travis gave him, his painting of her wouldn't be affected, for he held in his hand not the brush but his own heart.13.The girl came to the park everyday but Sunday at approximately 3:00 PM.Kurt never once approached her.The contest was due in one week, and Kurt had yet to finish his painting, for he could never potrayed the girl in the way he perceived her.He had torn six canvases already, and was on the way to destroy the seventh.Suddenly he was afraid.The fire of inspiration would kill his own artistic self before cruel reality did, for the perfectionist in Kurt expected nothing but the girl on his canvas.And that he couldn't do.It was November then.14.The contest was in three days.It was Saturday.He only got one last chance to finish painting the girl, for the contest was to be held on Monday.As usual, Kurt made his way to the park.But she was not there.Nobody was.November rain cut into the bone, chilling and harsh.She was not there.15.Kurt returned home, depressed.The perfect opportunity was gone, the dream was gone.As he sat alone in the dark that Saturday night, Kurt cried his heart out for what reason even he was not aware of.Was it that the flame had died?His muse left him in the deciding moment?He had actually gone back on his works and drew for Travis?He didn't know.All he knew was that he woke up on the cold hard floor, looking at the moon brightening up the empty eighth canvas.And it hit him.He never needed to look at the girl, he had forever engraved her image in his mind, her image with all of her qualities and beauties.So he painted all night long, painted into the blank canvas the woman he had never once spoken to in her most perfection, in her finest beauty, draped over her a scenery of a dream, for she was his dream.16.Kurt never entered the contest.He wanted to keep the painting for himself, so that she would only be his.But he knew if he did, it would forever pinned him to that moment only, and he could not proceed.So, he quit working for Travis, got a job at a small magazine with newfound confident, and left the city for another one.The day before he left, he returned to that same bench.2:45 PM.She should be here soon.Kurt place the canvas, wrapped in see-through plastic, on the bench.He then retreated to a nearby bush, watched as the surprised girl unwrapped the anonymous painting of her, then left with a grin.He wished to speak with her, but he knew to make any contact with her was to destroy his illusion of the girl.Thus, to keep her perfect, he never did, and never would, approach her.
