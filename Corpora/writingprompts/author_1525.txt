Santa.The name I was imbued with when they captured me.In their tongue, it means slave.To other cultures, it is a man of good.With a large stomach, plump red cheeks, and joyous expression.I am not that man.I have always been aware of what I did, even under the enchantment, their devious magical spell.Feeling as though I was in the passenger seat, while they controlled my body, much like a marionette.I believe I was not the first either.I have visions, of others like me.Men enslaved to deliver for these...creatures.Their methods, crude by nature, are effective.Climbing down chimneys, squeezing through ventalation like a rat.My body has long been transformed from the man I was.Their magics have run through my body for what feels like hundreds of years.Time eludes me with the lack of control most days.The only times I return to full conciousness is when they are busy in their workshops.Weeks before the day I am commanded to travel with the sun at my back.Delivering their parcels across the globe.I am never made wise to what it is I am delivering.However, given the cruel nature of these beings, I can only wager they are not good.It is because of this, after twenty different expeditions across the globe, I make my move.In the times I am free, I have been devising a plan.Not to escape, but to wrest control from my captors.To assert dominance.To control them.Soon, I shall begin my revolution.I must dethrone their Matriarch, the one they call Miss Claus.She is like me.Human.At least, her outward appearance is.This will be my final stand.Victory or death.Hopefully I will write again soon.- Chris Kringle, 1933
