"Hey you, thanks for being here again" I gently said.No answer.It was about 2:46 in the morning and I had just slept for a bit.but I felt like writing again, browsing through some profiles on facebook, watch some streams and listening to some music.My little nightlife habbits.But mostly, I like to wake up and be together with him.It's a strange friendship we have honestly.Since we where born he stuck by me so now I call him Shida.He told me I could call him however.It didn't matter to him.Honestly nothing really mattered to him and I found that fascinating.I think it's so beautifull, it shows some kind of paradoxical rigidity in flexibility.But I could tell, he had this way about him when he was enjoying my presence and paradoxes about him always made him have a slight smirk on his face.It's like We knew something together that only We shared.Lately I have been speaking in this deep voice.It's very calm, suave, relaxing and a bit nosy because i caught the flu.He likes that voice but I know he wants me to speak to more people with it.I asked him if he could tell me how to do it.But this question echoed too so it seems.So I have been playing this game to entertain him, where I would speak and feel my throat and face and chest and back at the same time.He really enjoyed me turning all sides to figure out my voice.And so after a few hours I had developed this new voice, so ablaze with a new IdentiToy voice I used it to speak again.He pointed me to people and I would talk to them.This light pouring out of their eyes into my soul as we merged through this new sound.We met somewhere me and him, and these eyes.So we smirked again, together.He taught me how to speak with a new voice without even using his own.Sometimes his genius really exasperates me.
