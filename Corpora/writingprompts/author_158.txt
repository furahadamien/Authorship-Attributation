I wake to the sound of my phone vibrating so fast I'm afraid it'll fall of my nightstand.I groggily my phone before it falls and turn it on to see the words "DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON" in bright letters illuminated by the official nationwide alert backdrop.The vibrations refuse to stop.Hundreds of texts are rolling in from numbers I don't know so fast that I can barely make out what they're saying.I set my phone to silent and put it back on the nightstand."Looks like a problem that can wait till the morning," I faintly think to myself before falling back to sleep.Nothing gets me out of bed at 3 a.m.
