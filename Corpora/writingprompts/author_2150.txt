The window shook from the intense wind outside.Sirens blaring just on the other side of the door.A pale skinned man stood in the center of a meeting room.Broken rays of light shined across his body, almost reflecting off of his pure white hair.The look in his eyes was both a warning and a challenge to any who would dare interrupt him."I still remember that day.I was around 10 years old.The day the Monoliths arrived.Most of you were not even born yet, but you have seen what trauma one of them can cause.Imagine thousands of them swarming over everything in sight it was"

A sneeze echoed in the room.Everyone turned around to glare at a woman wearing a very dark brown cloak over a yellow spandex suit.A look of horror on her face."You have one warning Nomad" said the man speaking.As he began to tell his story, again another sneeze half came out before her form turned to ash.Clearing his throat he began again."There was one light in the most darkest of times.The Chemist, yes that is a name you should all know.In fact, he saved me with a smile on his face.Though I doubt he remembers it.AND WHAT..." lava started to spill out of his eyes as though crying in his rage."WAS HE REWARDED WITH!a life nearing its end, being called a burden or a pest."The room began to buzz with noise and emotion.Disgust was the only universal thing that could be seen, even from the incorporeal bodies.How dare the Heroes treat their best like a piece of trash.The sirens outside seemed to go quiet.The door to the heroes association burst open, a cloud of ash inside filled the air as the wind blew in.An old man wearing a lab coat entered dragging an IV stand along with him.An oxygen mask adorning his face."Surrender you vile villains" he wheezed through the systematic pumping of his oxygen tank.The speaker winked at all of the people in the room.he spun around dramatically, holding his cape outstretched."NEVER!"The speaker rose into the sky, long white and silver robes swimming down his body.fire dancing around him almost mesmerizing all who saw him."I Am Sol, Leader of the Villains of the world.You can never hope to stop me!"The room all jumped into action.fire, lightning, lasers, ice, telekenitic blasts and insects swarmed the building from the outside.The police were all taking cover.A few were devoured by bugs or eviscerated by flying blades of force.Inside, a tiny frail fist hit the ground.A force once strong enough to shake the city, only now tipped over a chair, but everyone still fell to the ground.Sol flew at Chemist fire slagging the air vents above.The fight went on for a few slow minutes.Finally Chemist fell back, a look of determination and a smile across his face.He remained unmoving.Sol made his way over to the man and with a gesture closed Chemists eyes.Grabbing the zip ties from his belt."You will live forever, my dearest friend."The following days headlines were the same all over the world."407 Heroes dead including Lady Lucidity during a raid.The Chemist sacrifices himself to save the world one more time in the capture of the 62 Assailants."Edit: Sorry for any mistakes on Mobile.Tried to clean them up when I woke up.
