I'm really starting to hate CNN, and not just because of their fake news articles.All eyes have been on me for almost a year and a half.I'm the only person that still smokes, and honestly, at this point, I'm just doing it because I feel like pissing off the rest of the world.It's at the point where I have to grow and roll my own cigs.Marlboro sold me their recipe after they went out of business, and I grow my own tobacco, roll my own stuff, etc.The government has tried everything.First, the Prohibition of 2021, which cut smokers down by 97%.Then came the crackdown on dark web sellers, and eventually everyone got caught smoking.They found the names of people that hadn't signed up for drug tests, until the only people left were the ones off the radar.And then, the military swept the streets and found everyone that was left.It was May of 2038 when I was announced the last smoker in the United States.But here's the thing: they didn't arrest me.I had gone for multiple tests while smoking, never once did they stop me.Just told me I failed.I think it's because I simply didn't care, and therefore the government didn't care.It's kinda like breaking into a bank, and then when the police come to arrest you, you just say, "No."And then they stop, confused, and just walk away.Well, after that, of course, you become a national celebrity.The government still wanted me to stop, of course, but they couldn't really make me without locking me in a room for three weeks and making me cold turkey it out.So, first, they tried laws against growing tobacco."Okay," I said, "You win.SIKE!"And continued to grow more tobacco for myself.Then they tried ad campaigns.This is where it got annoying.I couldn't even go to the grocery store without seeing my face plastered to a wall, smiling back at me with the words "JUST QUIT GREG SCHMIDT" in big red letters surrounding the picture of my head.I was known by all, people pointed me out in the street.It was no use going somewhere else, either.One time I drove from my house in Virginia to New York City, and lo and behold, there I was in the middle of Times Square, my smiling meth mouth of a face looking at me among the words "YOUR FAMILY PROBABLY HATES YOUR FILTHY HABIT."They weren't even trying to rhyme anymore.They straight up hated me and wanted me to stop.So, when I was 45, 28 years after I had lit up my first cigarette, I decided that there must be something in the Constitution that protects me from this kind of public degradation.Nope.I took it to the Supreme Court and everything, no dice.The only people that liked me were teenagers that thought it was cool to stand up to the government and media sources that made money off of my "developing story of a life."I'm not even kidding.That's what they call my life.The catchphrases aren't much better, if one can even call them catchphrases.Here's a list of my personal favorites:

- SMOKING IS BAD FOR YOU (no shit)

- JUST STOP SMOKING GREG

- WHY DO YOU SMOKE, YOU BIG FUCKING JOKE

- THE POLICE ARE COMING GREG (ahahahhahahhahhahaha)

- (my personal favorite) JESUS CHRIST YOU STUBBORN BITCH

I don't know what to do anymore.My house is the only haven I have, if you consider a building constantly surrounded by paparazzi trying to take a picture of you a haven.I can't order pizza without the people fighting over who gets the chance to deliver the pizza to me.But, I must say, it's fun being known for something.I just wish the advertisements were a little less harsh.
