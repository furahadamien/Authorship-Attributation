"Turn around.Did I find you?"I became a stalagmite of dread, paralyzed in place by the voice that reverberated in my head.Clear as the crisp smell of rain on asphalt.Powerful as an shameful orgasm.I turned around, certain that the Voice -- creatively named, that -- would be naught but my mental illness quixotically tormenting the spinning gears of my mind."You did always have a way with words, but Jesus, take a creative writing class once in a while."I stood, stricken dumb.Additional parts of my psyche and anatomy experienced a cascading series of failures, until I was reduced to "um," "what," and "uhhhhh..." as the entirety of my skillset.She laughed.This astonishing, wildflower-scented, scarlet-haired woman in front of me was *laughing.* I could hear her laughter.Why could I hear her?I've never heard anyone make this sound before; only the Voice had taught me these things.I signed to her.*Who are you?*

"Wait.You're Deaf?But I -- but I would've known.I should've known, right?"Her jocund 'I've-found-you' smile turned into a mask of confusion.Taking care to fully form my thoughts as I was signing them, I told her: *Look, I can hear you, but I thought you were the Voice.You're supposed to be living in my head.Why are you real?Why can I understand your thoughts?*

"I'm in the same boat as you, I have nooooo idea.It's kind of stronger in one direction, though.I can only hear yours when you're really close to me, but I can feel you listening to me no matter where I go.That's how I found you, actually.I heard you for the first time, here at Lost Beans.I decided to broadcast myself and see who turned around.I, uh, I had no idea it'd be someone like you, I'll be honest."*How do you think I feel?*

"Granted."*What do we do now?I mean, you're the first person I've ever had a verbal, well verbal-ish, conversation with.I don't know what to say.*

She put her hands in mine."Make some kind of superhero team?I don't know either."*Maybe we should order some coffee.Come up with our secret identities.*

She laughed.And in an awkwardly cute effort, she slowly signed the phrase: "I'd like that."
