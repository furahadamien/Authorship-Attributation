I've been waiting in the ghostly office for hours as they look through my file, guess something about it is out of the ordinary.Not sure what it could be honestly, I wasn't anything out of the ordinary as far as humans go.There are a few defining moments I could think of that may fit the categories they mentioned, but you rarely get to see the full impact of your actions so I have to guess.Who was I the most cruel too?Probably my Ex, that one is a no brainer.It was a rocky relationship from day one and after four years of struggling through it, the ending wasn't any better.My depression didn't allow for emotional connections and my job didn't give me the time to try and figure the rest out.That would being me to the nicest.Do dogs count?I would love to see any of them again.All of them?Even thinking about them now makes me smile, and I doubt they would feel any different.Otherwise maybe a coworker?I treated everyone pretty evenly as far as I can remember.Rarely played favorites and if I did, it was merit based.Saving people, well I did that a ton technically.If you look back at my career as a doctor you would see countless lives saved through surgery.Hopefully that is what the gatekeeper was talking about.At least some are bound to remember me.But killed?Hard question.Some didn't make it through operation, but I never really made a decision that killed them.They were just lost causes when they came in.Any one of those might count but I am not sure that I can be judged for that, even in purgatory.After hours of thinking, that was all I could come up with.My ex, some dogs, and patients.I didn't live a very social life now that I think about it.A door creaked open in the dimly lit corner across from me, guess my jury has arrived.Footsteps echo on the floor as they approach the table, but something is off."Your case was a unique one Dr." the gatekeepers voice whispers through the shadows, "But we have found your judges.""The person you were most cruel to," rang out as the seat on the left was illuminated, empty."The person you were most kind to," it continued, the next seat lighting up.Again, empty."The person whom you saved," the pattern continued."And the person whom you killed," no surprise, empty."But how is this possible?"I asked, speaking to the empty room."I had to influence someone's life for better or worse.""You did," a voice resonated from right behind the chairs.It sounded familiar, but I couldn't put a face to it."Your case was special because all four categories were fulfilled by the same person," The voice continued, sounding both hostile and kind at the same time.If I wasn't dead I would die right here from how fast my heart was beating."Hello son," my mother said as she stepped into the light from behind the chairs, "It's about time we had this talk."
