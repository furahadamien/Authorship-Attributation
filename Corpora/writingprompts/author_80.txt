**Day 1:**

I can't believe this, and neither should you, frankly.Does it not to you seem contradictory in any sense that my reincarnations, all of a similar person (myself) yet different, a phenomenon I can only compare somewhat to the various editions of a book, can exist someplace all at once?"Where is this cinema?"I ask.None of me know the answer, but nobody leaves, and nobody but myself comes.There are 78 of me here, myself excluded, henceforth to be known in the grammatically appropriate contexts as *myselves*.The others' appearances I simply cannot describe.They look neither old nor young  they look visibly rejuvenated, glowing with a virtually tangible youthfulness, yet have retained in their bones and their cranium the wisdom that comes solely through old age and maturity.We are all naked, yet feel no shame.The cinema has 10 rows of eight seats.I take my seat at the front-most row, my head permanently in motion as I observe the people around me.There do, ironically, appear to be cliques, as though 78 versions of myself could not all get along.The large screen looming ahead of us is blank, so I rise from my seat and engage in conversation with myselves, an act I am familiar with, it not being the first time I have spoken to myself.The screen remains blank.**Day 293:**

I have not, contrary to the experiences of myselves' many ex-girlfriends, as myselves have been only too pleased to point out, gotten bored of speaking to myselves, but am satisfied anyway with the first visible signs of life.For the first time in what feels like a decade (though I am assured by Myself #23, the official timekeeper, that it is the 293rd day of Myself #80's life), the cinema lights up, rather abruptly.There appears briefly to be a problem with the sound system  which, I should mention, emitted exactly what Myself #80 heard during his time in his mother's womb  but it eventually returns to normal, and the screen is filled with a light so bright that as I turn my head to look around, for the first time since my abrupt materialisation in the dimly-lit cinema I am able to properly see my surroundings.As myselves return to their seats from the circles they had formed with their cliques, I follow suit to observe the birth of Myself #80, Arturo Bennedetto.**Day 3087:**

Arturo is growing up rather nicely.He's a bright boy, with a wit far sharper than that of his peers, and a passion for reading that most of myselves and I can relate to.Here he is now, waking blissfully to the delicate birdsong, which floats gently through his open window to alight, note by note, on his forehead.He cleans up and hops downstairs, only to see his parents arguing heatedly over the island counter in his kitchen for the seventeenth consecutive day, not that they are aware of his maturity and the fact that he has been keeping count.Not that they care anyway.Bitterly, he pours a cup of water down his throat, and leaves the room.**Day 6201:**

Arturo has dressed his best.Out the door he strolls in suit and tie, ignoring completely his bickering parents, having already been desensitized, every one of his steps oozing with confidence, the sunny summer weather perfectly reflecting his cheer.Down the pavement he walks, whistling a cheerful air, arriving, inevitably, at Ambra Carino's.Prom is just around the corner, and who better to ask to it?After all, they are best friends, united not only through a love of literature but their troubled pasts and the intricacy of their characters.With two self-assured knocks at her door, myselves and I eagerly awaiting what surely will be a rare day to celebrate, he announces his arrival.There is no response.He glances at his watch  it is half past 12.Knowing Ambra lives alone and there is no risk of waking another, he knocks again, on this occasion more than twice, and again, till five minutes have passed.His imagination providing several pessimistic reasons for the lack of a response, as is only typical of it, Arturo runs to the backdoor and knocks again.The silence is disquieting.He sheepishly calls her cellphone, only to have nobody pick up, and rereads their texts, only to detect nothing abnormal, nor any announcement of her leaving the house.A tear beginning to well in his eye, more out of the somewhat unreasonable but very real concern and fear his personality naturally generates than anything else, he reaches for the top of the door-frame, clasping with relief the key he knew he would find, and shoving it, with trembling fingers, into the keyhole.As the door swings open, he runs into the house and up the flight of stairs, arriving first at her bedroom door.Despite managing to calm himself down enough to at least knock at the door again, there is again no response.Arturo takes a step back, runs at the door, and kicks it open with his right foot.As it swings on its hinges, ricocheting off the wall on which it is mounted before once again covering the frame of the door, Arturo glimpses a sight of unimaginably horrifying proportions, much to his shock, and ours too.The bedroom door sways close, hiding Ambra's hanging, lifeless body, and Arturo, his self-confidence depleted, his swagger torn to shreds, simply doesn't know what to do.He presently decides to break down and cry.**Day 6210:**

"What will happen when the final seat is taken?"I once asked Myself #2."Who knows?"he replied."Perhaps we will all be reincarnated and a new circle will begin.Perhaps some of us will go to heaven and some to hell.Less unrealistically, though, perhaps the cinema will just continue to fill."As Arturo falls, then, from the top of the building, bracing himself for the impact, yet relatively sanguine, willing the earth to envelope him and to welcome him, I, too, brace myself for the impact, and mourn the loss of Myself #80.**[Edits: attempts at formatting.]**
