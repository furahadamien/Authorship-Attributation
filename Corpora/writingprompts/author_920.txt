I recently lost funding due to becoming immortal.Its weird to say out loud, but the devil stopped paying my bills after my "breach of contract", well that's what his lawyers say.You could say he's got a few on permanent retainer.Our original deal was I would spend eternity in hell after death in return for a bottomless pool of cash to fund my research.Well, to make a long story short, it took me just 4 months to figure out how to infuse living cells with immortality!Just CRISPR and a few segments of DNA from some microbes and WHAM!, no more pesky death.Of course, my efforts to get approval from the FDA were laughed at and human trials were seen as a joke.No one took me seriously.This pleased the devil to no end, of course.Well, that was until I found out I was sick.Incurable.Not something you want to hear from your doctor.I had a sneaky suspicion that my acquisition of this disease was not accidental.He wanted to collect of course.I sensed an uneasiness whenever he appeared from his very clich puff of smoke.Every night he showed up just to mock my efforts, and begrudgingly sign the next check."You're sure costing me a lot lately, Mr. Amaranthine," he said coyly, "But soon your punishment will begin, so enjoy it while you ....," he paused and looked puzzled."Why is this check just for two cents?Don't you want to enjoy what time you have left?"I couldn't help but crack a slight smile.So I replied, "I have plenty of money, billions in fact, what could I possibly need more for?"The devil looked puzzled and strolled up closer to me and eyed me head to toe."Something... Something is different.I can't smell your fear of death anymore."My smile widened, almost as much as the devils eyes.I could see a look of confusion wash across his face."It's impossible though, all humans fear death."he muttered to himself while stroking his his goatee.Suddenly, he started turning brighter and brighter red, small flames started dancing across his skin.All the  humanistic charm and sly wit burned away as his features quickly transformed into a demonic scowl."YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM MY LAWYERS!"he thundered at me, as he vaporized in a huge fireball."Wow", I thought to myself, "maybe it wasn't smart to antagonize him."If you hadn't guessed, I pulled a Jonas Salk and tested the procedure I developed on myself.What was there to lose?Turns out, plenty!It's not smart to trick the devil.Old Nick doesn't take kindly to being mocked.His army of lawyers descended on every aspect of my life.First, they discredited me professionally, as if I wasn't already a laughing stock, I was now unhireable.Second, they drove my family and friends away by painting me as the a Cosby/Weinstein level asshole.Hoardes of prostitutes and drug dealers all claiming I bought something off them.It took every last dollar I had to fight the onslaught of accusations.Lastly, they sued for Breach of Contract.Something that had never been done before.Heck of a trial!The devil had never thought about someone not being able to give up their mortal soul, so there were never any exit clauses added for such a situation.Turns out, once you ascend past deaths reach and truly become immortal, your soul is also therfore immortal.The whole original contract was ruled to be no longer valid though, since I was no longer able to fulfill the terms of the agreement.Bummer, but at least I no longer had anything of value for him to attain.Except my research, that is.We can't have the whole of the human race turning immortal, it would be a disaster for the heaven, earth, and hell!So we decided to sign a new deal, and that's where we are today.My second deal with Satan is about to be finalized.While he can't have my soul, I have agreed to remain the single immortal human.In exchange he agreed to honor my original request and supply me with an endless supply of currency once again.What can I say?Being broke and homeless for eternity just wouldn't be any fun...
