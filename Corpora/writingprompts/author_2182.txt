The game had started as a strategy to enter the other realm in the same way that the suburban humans had entered their own.By playing these strange, weak, passive characters engaging with their magicless quests to achieve seemingly meaningless goals, this unprecedented alliance of beings had hoped to squash the intrusion of humans into their realm.The intrusion of humans in the very bodies of their peoples, as they adopted them as characters in their 'game'.But it hadn't worked.For seven weeks, they had met every 'Wednesday evening after work' at human realm 7pm and adopted the characters of middle class suburbanites.But they had not successfully entered the realm.Why were they meeting again?Lingnith rolled a D8."I'm going to use my cantrip."She looked questioningly up at the necromancer Dungeon Master.He looked at his notes, "what, 'get an Uber'?"Lingnith, elven high priestess, was playing a 20 year old college student with rent in arrears due to her drinking habits.She checked her notes."no, no, I've got 'Ask Parents for Money'.I've got to roll a D8 above 5 to overcome their disappointment".It was a 6."ah.Okay.Your Dad answers the phone.He knows you want to ask for money, because he is familiar with your pathetic nature.He doesn't help make you comfortable.He tells you about his game of golf."The goblin King, laughed."this is good!Make her talk about golf!Ask him a question *Sandra*, pretend you are interested!"He enjoyed calling this high priestess something so ignominious as *Sandra*.She didn't react to the Fey Goblin monarch's taunting."I say, 'Daddy, I'm in trouble' ".Lingnith had to admit to herself, that she was having fun.And she'd noticed that there was less and less talk of whether or not this game was working, of how to *really* get to the suburban realm.It seemed that the others were having fun, too.Everyone laughed.

"'Daddy!'She called him daddy!That gives him feelings!", the goblin king slapped the table again.The necromancer cleared his throat after gaffawing."His impotent heart melts at your childish language.'oh princess, what's wrong?'he blubbers, completing the electronic funds transfer of an amount above that needed to cover your rent, even before you ask.'I've sent you some money, honey.Is that enough?, he says, feeling protective love.""idiot!She is going to spend it on vodka and life mistakes!"
