My step falters, the voice is back.'*I finally found you.*' she says, I breath in slow and deep counting down from ten telling myself it's not real, it never is, never was."But it is, turn around" she says, louder this time, or did the other sounds grew quieter."Come one Jerry, do you think you can run forever?"*Run?I'm not running from anything.* 

"Really.did you never wonder why you were so restless.why you never stayed in one place for long.always moving from one city to the next.Always in motion."*Of cause i was always in motion.The world has so much to offer and i want to see everything.I want to meet new people.*

"Come on brother, Sandy misses you"

*Sandy?Who is Sandy?i don't know any Sandy.*

"Please Jerry, it's time to come home.Father is waiting."I turn around "My father is dead."I want to shout, he died 10 years ago, but im stopped as i see who i was talking to.A small girl maybe six or seven with hair that looks like gold in the sunlight.I don't have a sister, mother never remarried after father was gone and a girl this young wouldn't remember my late father.But despite that the face looks familiar.As if I should know it, know the voice, the way she smiles at me as if I was a treasure thought lost.ARIEL the name appears in my mind as everything snaps into place like the world had shifted 5 feet to the left."No" i stumble backwards, away from her.I keep backing away shaking my head but my back bumps into something hard and the girl just continues smiling.I want to run, to sprint away as fast and as far as i can but as I look around nothing moves, everything stands still as if time simply stopped.Hands grab my shoulders pulling me back.The pull is what wakes me from my daze."NO!"i shout, fighting against the pull."They deserve forgiveness.PLEASE!""Come on, Jeremiel.It's time to go home, the time has come for it to come to an end" Ariel says, her voice cold.
