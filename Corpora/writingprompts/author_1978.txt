The towering monster asked  inquisitively.The whir of its translation unit was the only thing piercing the tension.My cranial implant was furiously taking notes, accessing data to find anything similar in name, and scanning the being to see if it had any weak points.but what stuck out most to me was the question.In my head a first contact would play out differently, for them to travel for what must have taken centuries at least to first ask something so strange.G-Goosha? I asked.What do you mean were the only intelligent beings on earth. 

Do not lie to me human the unit around its neck spoke.The records indicate differently

I dont know what you mean, please explain. 

I have to buy time, I thought to myself.This was a suicide mission, an armada of ships jumped into the system unexpectedly and race towards earth, this could only be bad.At this moment on earth planetary defense systems were arming and ships from across human territory where converging to rallying points.This is gearing up to be war.The alien was hideous, tall, brooding and black as night upon its back were what could only be described as wings.Its face was full and angled with tendrils guarding its mouth.The best description of it would be dragon like.A soft screech from an earpiece perched on its head Seemed to steady him, and the translation unit powered up.Forgive me human, we have come a long way for this, do you not know who they are?The records show their interactions with your kind. 

My cybernetics produced several theories to explain this top most being an ancient race who died out.Never the less it doesnt matter, buy time.I dont know friend, perhaps youve made a mistake.The martians coexisted with another race but that was before their war or their great hiding and longer since before the annexation.

No they were on earth, we spoke to them long ago, but lost contact shortly after a trade mission was destroyed.We suspect human intervention, like your kind so often do to other species. 

The cybernetics found it, this brute wasnt making a mistake he was referring to the people of Yurse a subspecies of man hidden in the Sahara by cloaking tech but when it wore out it revealed they had turned feral and tribal.How did I not realize it.Their discovery is what pushed mankind to the advanced people we now are.Its ironic The cannons that wiped out that trade fleet were rebuilt into the cannons that would destroy this pitiful fleet.The fleet that will wipe them out is built upon their ruins.And the  radar that will pinpoint these monsters home is the same that established contact with them hundreds of years ago.But that didnt matter, Any minute now and the orbital defenses will fire.The fleet is probably near and they have orders to kill.I couldnt help but laugh at these fools the beast looked towards me confused.Are you okay? The monster asked.Perfect I responded as my cybernetics sent its data to earth one last time, giving the green light to fire our cannons.From the window the dragon-like creature could see several beams of light shoot from earth toward the largest of the many ships before he could understand what was happening the alarm sounded and fire erupted from the other ships, blue light filled the vacuum of space and the navy has arrived, gunning down these aliens before the could fire a shot.The beast turned to me and its translator muttered.How.. why did you do thi- before he could finish his sentence he fell as three loud blasts filled the air as I shot him down.For earth! I shouted as I turned my gun upon myself.
