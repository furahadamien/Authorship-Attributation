As far as George was concerned, he had been set forth an impossible task.He had to devise a way that Voldemort could lose.By any metric, the Second Wizarding War was already over.The resistance was concentrated in a single castle in Scotland, and the rest of the island was occupied by the enemy.The enemy had vastly greater numbers, a more powerful leader, and more stable supply lines.After considering the problem, George noted that the First War had run into the same problem.JK famously solved it by having Harry kill Voldemort the first time, a strategically implausible but thematically moving decapitation strike that he wouldn't dare replicate.After all, he somehow doubted that the cycle of violence was entirely what Rowling had in mind.Whenever George himself found characters faced with impossible odds, he resorted to just calling the cavalry hinted at in previous chapters.There was no such cavalry.A larger scale issue was that JK had not fleshed out the world to any level worth considering!Despite his earnest efforts to the contrary, George had been unable to find even a single enumeration of the headmasters, let alone an in-depth history with dozens of previous battles from which to learn!It remained an open question as to how Hogwarts even fed itself...Oh yes, food.A week later, George had written a good ten pages describing in arguably maddening detail every pie filling, cooked bird, and crusted desert item available in the entirety of the castle.He noted on a Notablog that he had an extraordinary week.In less important news, he had finally formulated a winning strategy, and all it had taken was food.Despite his magical brilliance, Voldemort was remarkably easy to outwit.The end of the Siege of Hogwarts ran thusly:

Tom stepped over Potter's twitching form, the boy's face in a rictus of horror."Now," came the whisper from the pale and shrunken face, "do you appreciate that your madness is the reason your friends lie gasping in pools of their own blood?That your arrogance is why this castle fell in nigh twelve housr?"His voice cut off.The man rose up suddenly and he turned to Lucius."Listen carefully.Without delay go and cast the Killing Curse on all the bodies.Take no assistants and trust no one.""As you say my lord."Lucius raised his wand to cast the first curse on Potter, and then he dropped his wand.Lucius's face was covered in gore, brains sloughing off his slick cheeks.His eyes were a naked accusation, mad with the last fire of pride.Tom whirled around to block the next knife from Kreacher, and shot a Killing Curse in response.Kreacher fell dead, the mock locket of Regulus the Twice-Traitor clattering to the floor.The doors of the Great Hall shook from a great tremor, and then suddenly burst.Suddenly Voldemort faced hundreds of wizards and dozens of house elves.Harry Potter, whom Tom had just thought slain, now stood alive.The Elder Wand rose, humming in defiance, as his shields fell to a thousand echoing blasts.*I had killed him!I had rent his friend the boy to shreds, I had disemboweled his friend the girl and watched as she tried to conjure her insides back into her collapsing abdomen, he's dead he's dead!*


   Tom shuddered and fell, as half a hundred gaping wounds rose up on his skin, showing scarlet, and half a hundred more bruises and transfigurations skating across his skin.His scream grew high past the point of human hearing, his last words pleading with his mother not to have died, pleading with his father to have been great.His corpse was like nothing human.Well, George thought, looking over it with pride, maybe the author of Meathouse Man isn't the right choice for young adult literature.
