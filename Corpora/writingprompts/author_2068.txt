For the first time ever, the Galactic Union had a hard decision to make, and so they planned the best way to make it: a big arena was set up near the center of the galaxy where all the citizens could come to watch the Counselors expose and discuss a sort of problem so strange and new, no one knew how to deal with.&nbsp; 

One of the Counselor began with a presentation.The research was conclusive, it had been tested thoroughly by scientists from every planet in the Galactic Union: as you know, theres a law of nature that restricts the amount conscient view points our galaxy can hold.So every sentient life is linked, every energy equalled.And yet, for the last centuries we have suffered great losses with no apparent life given back to the galaxy. She pauses, a troubled look in her face.&nbsp; 

Another Counselor, noticing his colleagues distress, jumps forward to complete the thought.But now we have found conclusive evidence that nature has, in fact, been giving back..The crowd gasps in horror, but he continues.We are very sorry to say that the Galactic Unions Scientists Association, despite its best efforts, has overlooked a small planet near the edge of the galaxy where a sentient, although primitive, race has been reproducing at an alarming rate. The audience bursts in talk.The Counselor looks over at his colleague, expecting some help.&nbsp; 

She takes a rock-like storage device and shows a hologram of a model-human.The humans, as they call themselves, have been sentient for thousands of years and it would be expected that they would have reached maturity to contact de Galactic Union by now - no race has ever taken more than a couple thousand years to do so.That is odd, but not destructive.What is destructive, though, it that In the last couple of centuries, their population has exploded, causing the imbalance we suffer through to this day.

&nbsp; 

A third Counselor approaches the hologram.We are gathered here because we, as a Union, need to decide how to proceed.To let the humans fester or to control the situation.

&nbsp; 

The crowd roars.They want an end to the senseless deaths.&nbsp; 

Wait, we cant underestimate the value of their lives, just as we value ours.We have studied the psyche and history of the humans and I would like to point out that this spike in natality is not natural to humans, it was a unfortunate combination of bad luck and a few close minded individuals that set up such a sad course of existence for the entire race. The first Counselor says.&nbsp; 

In fact, I would theorize the high procreation and the lack of maturity are linked.When put in a state of subservience and of forced ignorance, the human mind couldnt help but become self-destructive.They created a cycle of not using their consciousness in order to gain momentary pleasure and because of the momentary pleasure not troubling themselves with the full use of consciousness. Said the second.&nbsp; 

The humans enslaved their own minds by their greed.But they might have redeeming qualities still.The average life-span of a human is of less than 100 years!What did any one of us accomplish in our first 100 years? Continued the first.&nbsp; 

The third Counselor, although touched by the arguments, disagrees.What you fail to expose is the aggressive, petty nature of the humans, they arent like us at all!

&nbsp; 

Look at yourselves.We are all aggressive and small in our nature, we have learned to not let it get the better of us, cant they?

&nbsp;  

None of the peoples in the Union needed any sort of guidance to achieve the requirements to enter the Union.Its not so difficult, we only expect a responsibility to reason and to the community.They have neither and are putting those of us who do have in danger.

&nbsp; 

Im not one to rule out that we may need to take severe action here, I dont wish to put the lives of the peoples that have proven their service to the betterment of the community in jeopardy, and i have to admit i do see that their lives arent on par with our own.Their lives destroy, both there on their planet and here, million of light years away.

&nbsp; 

And they only last a fraction of what ours last, by their own failure to apply they millennia of existence to their betterment.

&nbsp; 

Yes, but doesnt it make us just as bad as the humans to exterminate an entire race for our benefit?

&nbsp; 

The crowd is silent, thinking.&nbsp; 

Im afraid they are too far gone.But maybe, if they are so self-destructive, we dont need to exterminate them.They can do it themselves.

&nbsp; 

The second Counselor sprints up.I have an idea.I warn you, its a weird one, but stick with me for a minute.Having viewed all the files about humans history I think we have a chance to try a unique sort of both experiment and non-destructive solution to the human infestation.We are looking at the galaxies limitation in number of observers in a literal way.The galaxy cant be observed by more than a set number of points, it would overload its rendering and glitch us all out of existence.So nature has a mechanism for making sure we never reach too many view-points by killing a random observer once a new one comes to existence.But what if we can diminish the view-points in other ways?Maybe by combining two observers view-points or even by turning an observer away from the universe and onto, basically, a wall.

&nbsp;

The crowd cheers.&nbsp; 

The third Counselor steps in.Humans might be prime for an experiment like this, with their tendency to subservience and, if I recall the files correctly, long history of subscribing to totalitarian attitudes.

&nbsp; 

The first Counselor this for a moment.And by not killing them all, we would be giving them a chance to achieve betterment some day, when their consciousness is strong enough to break the confinement.

&nbsp; 

That would be a historically slow maturation, but where there is life, there is hope.

&nbsp; 

Our counsel is settled then.We move forward unless theres anyone against it?

&nbsp; 

No sound comes from the crowd, indicating its support to the motion.&nbsp; 

Its settled then.The humans will probably not even notice a thing.
