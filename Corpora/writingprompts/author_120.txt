As I was inpatient waiting for my destiny to come, it suddenly hit me, I was dead.Just like that, no pain, no last conscious breath, just my heart that decided to stop beating.As my soul turned around and said goodbye to my lifeless body, I was amazed by the path my spirit was taking.Nothing too special or specific, just a long road with no near end.I just sat back, relaxed, and waited for the time of arrival to come.When I finally got there, I was kind of confused about what I was doing in that place.It was just like the movies, but nothing like youd have ever thought.There was no heaven, no hell, no point in between, just an old theater full of creatures I believe were human at some point, but that also looked terrifyingly similar to me.I believe that I had a I dont know what the hell is going on face, because at this point, one of my lifeless clones decided to take me to my seat.They were all ordered by years, and by that time I kind of had an idea of what was going on.My theory is, Im all of these guys, and they are all me, the only difference is the era and the life each one of us lived.I was correct.The moment I decided to sit in the place indicated by the other me, a tape started rolling.I was intrigued by the content I was watching, and it took no less than 5 seconds for me to get automatically attached to it.It didnt feel natural, but familiar, and thats when I realized that I was watching my upcoming new life, which was both awesome and extremely weird, but I was willing to give it a go, since Im pretty sure I could not have gotten out of there even if I had wanted.
