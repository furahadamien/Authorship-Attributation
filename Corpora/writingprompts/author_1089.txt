I could not believe what I was looking at.It was hard to make out amidst the crimson Martian backdrop but there was no doubting it: there it was, the red flag of a forgotten behemoth fluttering in the heavy wind.I drove towards the flag and saw a cornucopia of alien-looking metallic parts strewn about.It was too cold here, at the 'north' pole of Mars, to remove my pressurized suit but I could swear I felt a cold breeze spiraling up my spine.We had chosen the north pole because countless computer simulations had shown this to be the only viable landing spot given the planet's tumultuous climate.And yet, somehow, the Soviets had figured it all out before the invention of the microprocessor!Still perplexed, I climbed out of the rover and started walking towards the flag - One small  step for man, one giant *fall* for mankind.I immediately heard a loud beep and a projector beamed light from somewhere amongst the rubble onto the swaying flag.It was the image of a cosmonaut, his features barely visible beneath the visor."So, you have finally caught up.", he spoke with a heavy accent."But your joy is unfortunately short-lived.You see, what you fail to realize is this simple fact: A trap is far more useful than a petty boast.You are here and that could only mean that we have failed, our leaders have failed and our fatherland is no more.We have lost but we will not lose alone.Vengeance will be our farewell for what good can come from a world without the USSR?The USSR is no more thus, no longer shall there be a world.You see, ", I could now see a pearly white arc beneath that visor, "the Soviet nuclear launch codes were not just in the hands of our great leader, they were also here; here, beneath your very feet.We thank you, dear enemy, we can only thank you."And that is how I fulfilled their prophecy; that, is how I became the very last scream of humanity.
