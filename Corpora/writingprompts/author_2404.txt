You know, most people expect the hero or villain of a story to have at least some form of an unneccecarily plot-devicy ego, that makes fights longer than they should be and gives the other party too many chances to win.Well, i'm not like that.If someone tries to stop me from dissassembling their lair, or tries to force me into handing over my newest piece of stolen supertech to the authorities, then i defeat them, plain and simple.No monologe, no ethical debate, no second chances.YOu get in my way, and you get rekt.No excuses.You have your hand on the self-destruct of your Handwavium-powered superreactor?You'll be dead before you can move a muscle, smartass.Charging your super-heroic friendship-powered ultimate attack?I hope you didn't need your arms, showoff.You want to make a deal?Not interested, go spend the next year in the ICU, dickhead.Etc, etc.THis has given me a reputation of sorts, of the "everyone fears and/or despises me" variety.Villains are more afraid of me than of any actual hero, and the hero's fear running into me more than they do with their own villains.I'm the guy that cuts your face of mid-monologue.I'm the guy that breaks your legs in the middle of your heroic charge.I'm the guy that shoots people instead of engaging them in a superpower duel.I am the Lair Eater, and i'm the most lethaly effective villain in history.
