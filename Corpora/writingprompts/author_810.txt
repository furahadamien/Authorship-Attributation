Part 1: The green lush grass met Matthew's foot like a cushion as he stepped, pale, gaunt, and nervous, onto the shore.In the distance a child laughed as a young dog bounded up to her with a stick.A bird trilled softly somewhere across the rolling hills.Matt could feel a cool lavender breeze waft past his face as he turned to the equally gaunt boatman:
"Uhm, Chairon, was it?Are uh, you sure you brought me to the right place?I mean, it's not my habit to question divine judgement and all, but ain't I s'posed to be in, uh, hell?"The boatman squinted around, drew a slick tablet from his black robes, and spoke as he scanned it with his dimfire eyes "Chairon's the horse guy.Trainer of heroes.Disney made him into fat goat guy voiced by Danny Devito.I'm Charon.Wayfarer of souls across the river styx.Disney made me into a skeleton man without lines" Before Matt could discern whether or not that was irony on the boatswain's flat voice, Charon went on."Nope, everything's in order.You're in hell.Looks like it's under new management though... again.Fuck.If you'll excuse me, I have to go figure out who's gonna pay me now, talk with the established authorities on the other side, and ferry..." he scrolled through his tablet "Two-hundred thirty three thousand five hundred thirty seven souls accross this river" He paused to murmur "Fuck: Myanmar and Yemen are killing me today" to himself before turning back to Matt "So if you wouldn't mind sidling along off into whatever hell this is now, I'd like to get on with my meager daily schedule" Nope.Matt was decided.That wasn't irony in his voice.That was peevish sarcasm.Matt's frame hardened as he bristled:
"Listen dude.In case you forgot, I died today, relived all of my sins today, realized I had been a piece of shit in life today, got tossed off the pearly cloud and landed facefirst in the mud at your ferry today, and am in no mood to go off into this without knowing a little bit about what's going on!....today."He took a breath "So EXCUSE me if this is a bad day for you, but this is literally my worst day.Cut me a break and tell me what the fuck is going on"
As the boatsman's eyes met his, Matt's spine did a creepy kind of tango.Charon's voice emanated as he spoke "What is one angelic rebel against..." checking his tablet "One hundred fourteen billion two hundred fifty three million five hundred forty nine thousand seven hundred fifty two conscious, intelligent rebel mortals that have ultimately been freed from the shackles of death?... Hitler was an intelligent man Matthew Marbruck.Stalin even moreso.Even Squalbuck the sentient squidlord was smarter than your average heavenly dolphin.And don't forget that Atistotle was never baptized, Plato never prayed for a heavenly father to save him, and Hypatia never prayed to Jesus, Allah, Ganesh, or any of the millions of other other saving principle.Aurelius believed that life stopped when we drew our last breath and our bofies died, and even Constantine (who ushered heaven into the world-stage) committed murder, even genocide, by the thousands, just like Aurelius.Hell is not what you think it is.Death is not what you think it is.Tread carefully, and know that things change."He paused, and for a moment, the steel left his spine, the fire left his eyes, and his lips curled into what could have been a smile... long ago."I know not what power rules this realm right now, but you will know soon enough.Goodbye Matthew Marbuck, and good luck."A swish of water around a pole, a rush of mist, a laugh (perhaps?)and Charon disappeared across the river.Before him, rolling hills stretched as far as he could see, full of willows, and birch, and mystery.Above him, tbf e fiery sunset sky faded into inexplicable darkness as it met t bf e river.The child and the dog had disappeared, but the lavender breeze had not.Catching, momentarily, a hint of the feeling he had felt as he hopped a moving cargo train amongst Provence's aromatic, amethyst fields, or rolled stolen, fragrant purple buds into a spliff, Matthew decided that in death, like in life, he would go any way the wind blows.At this point it really didn't matter to him, and it wouldn't... until he knew what 'It' was.Sorry guys.Was planning on finishing, but have to get to an impromptu appointment.Hopefully, you guys will want to hear parts two and three.I'll be by later.
