Gazing_Into_The_Void
"Dude, I totally swear to God, my home boy Jesus fed 5,000 men with *nothing more* than seven loaves of bread and seven fish!", Brad explained, waving his arms around wildly as if it illustrate the extent of Jesus' feat."It was a total miracle!I swear to God!"Chad added, rumpling his goatee, and swirling his starry cape.I sighed in exasperation."Do not take the name of thy Lord in vain", I mumbled under my voice.But the sprawling crowd of sailors, and carpenters, and herdsmen, and washerwomen were lapping it up.I suppose Jesus was a pretty unconventional religious leader, right?He mixed with prostitutes.He went wandering off into the desert for months on end.He anointed ushis trusty disciplesin that sweet, sweet kanabos oil, and sent us off flying into the sky.Until those sneering Roman bastards crucified him he was a pretty chill guy.Maybe that's why Brad and Chad listened to Jesus when most everyone else was mocking him.Even me.Still.I wish they wouldn't blaspheme so much.And they're taking the whole kanabos thing to a new level.Blazing up ounces and ounces of the stuff with Mary Magdalene and Simon Peter.John the Baptist used to get *pissed*.He told me the smoke gave him a ringing headache.And heaven knows what they are trying to do in the Dead Sea with those wooden boards.They call it "surfing".A mighty waste of time.I shook my head.I think I'll leave all of their antics out of my gospel.
