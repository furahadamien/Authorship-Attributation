The first time I killed a man, I swore I'd never do it again.We're more than just the sum of our experiences.People, I mean; there's always that core of *who* you are, whether you're human, andlarian, an eighth-dimensional overbeing from the planet Klaaarg or just an uplifted, intelligent dog.I guess it's probably what you'd call a *soul.*

Your experiences *shape* that, mold it and twist it every which way; in another life, Steadfast might have been an insurance salesman, or Revenant a waitress, or Kinetic a soldier.Instead: Paragon.Avenger.Scientist.Superhero.Your experiences may not be the be-all, end-all of your existence, but they play a role in who you are in *this* life...and I can take that all away.I discovered my abilities as a child.I was able to take...*moments,* from people.That candy bar I'd walked out of the store with.That chore I never did.I was an entitled little brat, to be honest, but none of that part of my life really stuck with me.A haze of childish hedonism, taking advantage of everyone I could get my hands on.(Literally.That's how my powers work.)The first time I killed a man, it was my father.He'd started to piece things together.Missing moments, missing tidbits that he remembered but my mother didn't, or vice versa.I'd had a good run--I was fifteen at that point--but I was a child, sloppy and careless.One night when my mother was out, he confronted me.I, being the arrogant, self-centered little shit that I was, tried to reach him, to make him forget the whole thing.He grabbed a knife.The details of the scuffle were unimportant, really.He didn't get to take many swings at me before I got my hand on the back of his head.What I remember most clearly about that fight was what happened after: my father, confused, frightened, and entirely unaware of who he was, who I was, who he had been.I took his whole life after high school away from him, and so the man who raised me was as good as dead.He ran.I did, too.I don't know what my mother thought when she came home to find us both gone.I know my father eventually turned up at his childhood home, confused and scared, and eventually had one too many nervous breakdowns and jumped from a thirtieth-story office.Steadfast caught him before he hit the ground, but the light had gone out inside of him.He made it two more years before drinking himself to death.As for me...it goes back to a blur.I didn't accomplish anything worthwhile in my late teens and early twenties.I stole, I took advantage, I lived for me.What else could I have done?What else *should* I have done?The second time I killed a man, I found out the answer to that question.Firebug was a small-timer, in the grand scheme of things, but to me, he was the most frightening man in the world.I happened to be in the lobby when he decided to hold up a bank.I watched him burn frightened tellers, people I'd been fooling for months into helping me live in the lap of luxury, and I did nothing.I watched him burn terrified hostages, and I did nothing.I watched him turn on a wailing toddler, watched him flick that gaudy lighter he used to kick-start his flames, watched--

--I watched his arm fall to his side, the lighter clattering to the ground, his eyes meeting mine through those horrible tinted goggles of his, the confusion and fear playing across his face as I pulled his head back, until--

--until the light went out, and Firebug was gone.The hostages ran.I did, too.I kept his stupid lighter, though.I remember...I remember the *shame* of it.Like I'd done something *wrong* by saving all those people.I remember running from myself as much as from fear of recognition.I remember...I woke up, days later, in a puddle of drool and vomited pills, and decided it was time to be someone new.The third time I killed a man, I was as kind about it as I could be, considering the circumstances.Doctor Kringle, to be quite frank, (and I am), didn't deserve it.He was a real bastard, and only a *real*  bastard would have hit on the theme of being an evil Santa.Of all things, an evil *Santa.*  He couldn't even name himself something clever, or Krampus-themed, or any of that.No, he'd dress up like Saint Nick, ghost himself into people's houses, give their children exploding presents or poisoned cookies, and then disappear.He'd hit a few dozen homes each Christmas night and then vanish, and the American superhero community was running itself ragged after two consecutive Christmases of his heinousness.They were finally zeroing in on his base of operations.It was sheer luck that I got to him first.The damnedest thing about Doctor Kringle was that he looked for all the world like that jolly-faced white-bearded corporate-controlled goofball image that was the modern-day representation of Saint Nicholas.He looked the part, and so...I found him through some old friends of mine, friends who quickly forgot I'd ever been there.I snuck in while he was out buying groceries.I hid in a maintenance closet under a pile of spare Santa costumes, and when he went to sleep that night, he never woke up.Well, Doctor Kringle never did, anyways.Christopher Freudenberger woke up just fine, in a motel ten miles down the road, with no memory of his crimes, or his abusive parents, or his failed attempt at starting a candy store in his youth.All he remembered was that children were joyful and innocent, and that all he *really* wanted to be was Santa Claus for them.He embraced his new life wholeheartedly.I did, too.I wasn't responsible for *every* disappearing supervillain.Some of them were killed by their own plots, some retired or gave up, some just decided to melt back into the population and pretend nothing had ever happened.Me, though?I took down dozens over the years, from nobodies like Billy the Squid all the way on up to heavy-hitters like the first Earthmover.Still don't think I did a great job with that one--you all found him pretty quickly after I got him.I'm not gonna blame you for hauling him off to Faraday; the man'd held whole cities hostage before.Still...I was pretty proud of having successfully shifted him over to wanting to start a family and settle down.I hear his daughter's stirring up trouble in New York, these days.Maybe you should look into her before she causes some real damage.Yeah, I can see you out there, Steadfast.You always were terrible at blending into the background, even in civilian clothes.I know you can hear me through the walls, and I...want to thank you for letting me finish this recording.It's terrible, to be forgotten.I should know.Still, maybe I'm not as forgotten as I thought I was.This morning's paper, for instance.That article by Kinetic's reporter friend was a gripping read, and it's really good to know that you heroes never stop looking into the unsolved cold cases.Learning about the ongoing mystery surrounding the brain-death of small-time supervillain Firebug and the disappearance of his longtime partner Oblivion, well...Sometimes, I wish I could forget that day.I suppose in some ways I already have, but they were important ways.Ways that made me who I am now.The things I'm missing, I didn't need.They made me...someone different.Forgetting who Oblivion *really* was made me...*better.*  Reading this article just highlights the cruelty and callousness of my youth, and that, too, is something I don't need anymore.I'd really like to forget it.Until today, I already had.I already threw the paper in the fireplace.Used Firebug's stupid lighter to start the fire, too, and I'm now certain that this isn't the first time I've done that over the years.I'm not asking everyone else to forget about Oblivion, you see; I'm just asking that you let *me* forget him.In fact, all it takes is for me to grip the back of my head, like *this--*
