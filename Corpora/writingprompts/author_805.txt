"So, you want to do a revolution?"I was asked."Yes, why not?"Hitler asked me.I wasn't exactly happy with the fact Hitler and I were cellmates in the same part of Hell.I was actually one of the many people who claimed."I was here by mistake" but it was the part of Hell which I'd been lumped in which really annoyed me.I was in the part of Hell with dictators, fascists, killers, and mass murderers.It was Nazis, Huns, Emperors, and more.We all lived in an enormous Super-Max prison straight out of Silent Hill.It was overcrowded, under funded, and the demons were clearly more afraid of us than we were of them.The thing was, of course, the guards didn't need to contain us all because they knew what I did."Well, the problem is, Adolf, that if we do take over then we're even more fucked," I pointed out the obvious."Stalin is LITERALLY listening right now.""Fuck you!"Stalin called over from his cell."I got better things to do than listen in on Hitler."Mao, his cellmate, gave me the bird."The demons here are all fallen angels, gods, and uplifted spirits," I said, gesturing around."They don't give a crap about us but they can't be as nasty or hateful as any human.The worst stuff that's happened to me, to you, and to the others have all been at the hands of other prisoners.This block has the Nazis, communists, Italian fascists [who did a lot better here than up above], Imperial Japanese, Mongolians [the bad kind], Aztecs, and Qin Chinese."Adolf said, "You're saying our problem is if we take over, we'll just be feuding with each other.Even more than we already are.""Yes," I said, pausing."Mind you, I'm not saying that it's a bad idea, I'm just saying that we need to note that our enemies aren't just the guards.""Damn Jewish demons," Hitler hissed.I slapped him."What the hell!"Hitler said."Adolf, don't say that shit around me," I said."Remember, no Nazi likes you for getting them into this.I am the one guy who keeps you from being beaten up daily and I DON'T KNOW WHY."Truth be told, I had a way too soft a heart.Dude probably did deserve a curbstomping every day of his life but he'd been getting one since the forties.I'm not sure how much he'd learned from it but I was a believer good guys didn't resort to the tactics of the enemy.I also knew how to make friends, negotiate, and network down here--which I did because even in hell there was a demand for goods.Especially in hell.It also seemed other people like me had ended up in a different section of hell for "Usurers."Which was actually a good thing since they were treated worse than the mass murderers.Food for thought."Some of the new Nazis still like me," Adolf said."I will say, though, my actions may have been mistaken.""You think?"I said, sighing.It was surprising how many delusional psychopaths changed their mind about their life plan when it ended them in an eternity of torment.Still, I needed to get out of here and I was ready to do things I hadn't been prepared to do while alive."Okay, I don't want to do this but I'm not a fan of Hell as a concept in the first place.So here is how we're going to solve both our problems."All three dictators listened intently."Multi-level marketing," I said."Every soul gets to move up by trading in Soul points.""What are soul points?"Hitler asked."Only I know," I said, staring at them."But everyone can earn one for shanking a guard."And I had them.

A Rebuttal to Nickofnight's: 

"Mr.Philips?"the voice asked."Yes," I said, pausing as I looked up from the bar.It had been months now since the divorce and I was already a social pariah.There had been a Black Mirror episode about how the public turned against people they considered to be child murderers in shocking ways.I wasn't considered one but I was considered criminally negligent and if they couldn't throw me under the bus for killing kid, they could certainly make me seem like someone who was a lunatic.I mean, seriously, why had I even bothered telling the truth?I looked up and blinked.What the fuck?Was this a joke?"Yes, nice to meet you," a man dressed like Hagrid said.Well, dressed like was difficult to say as the man cosplaying as him was an Andre the Giant-looking man with a big thick bushy beard.He looked, if not quite like my idea of the man from reading the books to my son, quite a bit closer than the illustrations in the book or movies."What is this?"I said, nursing my beer.This was the kind of dive where people didn't care if you were an infamous scumbag."Well, your child is wonderful but it seems like he fell through the cracks for a bit and no one bothered to give you an update," Hagrid said."The thing is, your home life situation is a bit of a concern and...well, your ex-wife doesn't believe us.""Believe you?"I stared at him."You realize you're a fictional character."That's it.I'd lost my mind.I'd cracked."Yes," Hagrid said."However, that's how magic works.All of the fantasy places people really believe in are real.Middle-Earth, Narnia, and that little place with the silver slippers that turned into ruby ones after the movie.Heaven and Hell too.You believe in them enough and they become real.Just not in this reality where everyone just believes in their next meal."I laughed.It was a bitter gallow's laugh.This had to be a particularly sick prank or hallucination."So, my child was spirited off to Never-Never land.""No, that's a different place," Hagrid said.I stared at him."Bullshit."Hagrid paused."Haven't you ever wondered why so many people disappear without a trace?"I blinked at him.They disappeared because the world sucked and ate people before spitting them out."Because they go to Fairyland?""That's a racist term where I'm from but essentially," Hagrid said."Why has no one returned?"I asked."Told the world?"Hagrid shrugged."Would you?"I wouldn't.The vicious emptiness of the world had been exposed to me by how easy it had been to turn the woman I loved against me, my parents, my employers, and my so-called friends.Barry had believed in Hogwarts because, at the end of the day, it had good people in it as well as bad.I wanted to believe in that world now.A world where the Voldemorts of the world hadn't won.No, not even the Voldemorts, the Dursleys and Professor Umbridges.Wow, I'd thought a lot about those fucking bucks.Way, way too much if this was any indication.I wasn't even that drunk."You're a lot more eloquent than you are in the books," I said, surprised he was still there after shaking my head."That's also racist."Hagrid paused."I also took some correspondence courses after the Dark Lord fell."I cried and couldn't help but whisper."So, my kid is alive?I'm not insane?"I, of course, was asking a half-giant from a children's story book.But if I had lost my mind then it was a better reality than the one I lived in."Oh yes...and we'd like you to come with us.You'd be a Muggle there but all your favorite characters would be there.Your son too."I paused."What will happen here?""People will believe you committed suicide.We'd substitute a body made of MeatGrow and FaceWax."The names of the spells made me laugh before I realized the full implications of what he was saying.Could I do that to them?Surely, they'd miss me.I thought of my friends and family.The ones who'd turned on me.Then shook my head."Good."
