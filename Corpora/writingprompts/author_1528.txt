My chains clanged against the icy floor as I shifted in my cell.The darkness of the *North Pole* was different from the darkness back home.It was.... Bluer.It felt like the sky itself had come down and swallowed you, and I've been living in this darkness for the past year.It wasn't always like this.Once upon a time, I was a Bishop.A full-blown, hot-blooded follower of Jesus the Messiah.*Foolish*, I spat.I'd long since learned that I create my own miracles - the power I had attributed to the Lord was something inside of me.If only it were powerful enough to get me out of this prison.I heard the steps of my jail-keepers... Two of the nastiest *Elves* you've ever seen.To my surprise, they brought someone else with them.The leader of the Elf Clan.Jack Frost.The only other being I've encountered with powers similar to my own.His hair and eyes where the same chilling blue, and his breath left his mouth in puffs of vapor."It's time".Nothing about Jack was warm, not even the smile pasted onto his face.I looked at him closely.Slowly, and carefully, I stood up."Remove my chains."The guards quickly started unlocking the cuffs to free me.The elves led me down countless hallways, each covered in ice and painted red and white.I wondered why they forced me into slavery - why they forced me to give gifts to children every year.After all, I had given gifts to others before my capture... Why force me to do what I was already doing?We got to the sleigh, a bright red contraption that dispersed toy for me.A much more efficient method than what they used to do - that is, force me to use my magic to squeeze myself through chimneys.Now, the gifts fall to the houses on their own.As they began to lock me into my mobile prison, I heard.... A tapping noise.As far as I could tell, none of the elves heard it.It grew louder.Eventually I see where it's coming from, cracks forming on the wall.All of a sudden, the wall shatters, and figures start to pour through the new entrance.A muscular man with dainty wings, an elf dressed in green armor, a flying baby with a shotgun, and a large rabbit.The rabbit looked at me, his Australian accent then unfamiliar to my ears."We're the Holiday Heroes.We're here to rescue you."
