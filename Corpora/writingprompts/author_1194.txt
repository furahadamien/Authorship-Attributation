I read the prompt again to confirm what had been written.*You are told that you are loved and accepted for who you are...*

As I read this, my thoughts begin to  overwhelm me once again..."Why?," I ask myself."What have I done to deserve this kind of love?Am I really the kind of person worthy of love, and if I am, why do I feel worse after reading this?!?"*Maybe it's because you don't deserve this love.You know that you're not a good person.It wouldn't be right for someone as worthless as you to receive a love like this.*

*You're a burden rather than a blessing to those around you.You feel that there is nothing to love about you because THERE TRULY IS NOTHING TO LOVE!!* 



As the thoughts begin to subside, I see the face of a man on my screen.The face of a man who  hated himself because of his shortcomings rather than cherish his blessings.A man who was exhausted from doing so for so many years that he hardly recognized himself.I reach towards the screen, hoping to somehow convince myself that the face was just a picture that I could swipe away.Instead, the man's face remained, realizing my worst fears had come true.I had become this man, a man I thought I had murdered and buried years ago, who did nothing but ruin every close relationship I had, suck all of the happiness from my life, and left emptiness to replace it.I could've sworn that he looked different back then as well, as he had fewer wrinkles, was clean shaven, and his hair was less grey.Now I realize the truth.I did not kill this man.He is here, staring at my reflection.The darkness had never left...   





>Thank you for reading.I'm sure that you might be questioning my mental state, and I don't blame you.>Thankfully, this was only a reflection on my prior bouts with depression.The holidays always have a knack of reminding me of the darker times of my life.I'd like to think that it's also a reminder of how far I've come since then as well.>I've been wanting to write something like this for quite some time.I was hoping for my creative juices to start to flow with a happier topic, but I couldn't help myself.> I'm hoping that this will help me start to become a more frequent contributor to this subreddit.I love reading everyone's stories, and often write my own, but I'm usually too late or too afraid to post them.Hope everyone has a merry Christmas, or whatever you plan on doing this day.Have fun, love, be loved, and cherish your blessings!
