They didn't realize what they had done.It wasn't that he fired me.Hell, I could deal with that.It was that they were a dishonest pricks when they did.That pissed me off.Little did he know I was rich.Not just "Fuck you Rich" but "Fuck Me Rich."Fuck you rich is where I can spend money to fuck someone over just as a fuck you.Fuck me rich is where I have enough that I can fuck myself in the process and even if it stings *a little*, it will hurt them *a lot* more.I had just wanted a job to kill time, relieve boredom, and hide the fact that I was stinking rich.Nobody expects the meek collator.But no, they had to screw around with me.That's fine, I would just have to find other ways to relieve boredom.My initial thought was to just burn the place to the ground, but that would be too simple.So instead I bought the company.My first move was to transfer out anyone who knew I was fired.Easily accomplished.I gave them a bump in pay and sent them to Detroit.Every time it looked like they would quit I would either bump their pay just enough to where they thought it made sense to be that miserable or just buy out the competition preventing them from leaving.Phase two was developing a squirrelly personality.Someone no one wanted to interact with.That was easy enough.I just modeled myself after the senior staff.That's where things got fun.I started adding more and more administrative requirements from corporate.Reports, discussions, meetings.I added bureaucracy until everyone effectively had five to ten bosses and nothing could get done.I made the entire company a living hell.The next phase was to call in auditors and consultants.Oh these guys were great.They were able to spot all the stupid rules that had made, all the redundancies, but even better they were able to bring a sense of dread to the company at large.All the while, I waited, letting Bill move my desk from location to location.Stealing my stapler.Until the entire house of cards collapsed and then I burned the place down.
