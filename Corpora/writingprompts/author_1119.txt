I woke up on a clean white bed.I remembered last night, remember my heart stopping after a long battle, but it all felt like a dream.Where ever I was, it was a place I didnt want to leave.I got up off the bed, expecting the familiar creak of my seventy year old knees, but I instead found myself young again.Odd.As I opened the door to the small room I had awoken in, I was greeted by a library.Not just any library, but the library of me.The library of Leo.What is this place? I asked the air.Your life story. The air answered.I suggest you start with book 17 page 1253.
I was trapped in the two rooms, so I figured I would follow what the voices in my head said.When I opened the book to the recommended page, my breath stopped.In it was the recorded history of the most important day of my life.The day I decided to conquer the world.I had always wondered what would have happened if I had just quit.What would have happened if I moved to the middle of no where in some random country and had opened a little shop.What would have happened if I married, had kids, had grandkids.But I had made my choice that day.I chose to conquer the world through a bloody campaign of war and genocide in the name of the American Empire; for the good of the people.In the end I lay dead with the world in ruins.To decide not to destroy the world, go to book 57, page 106.I found the book, and opened to page 106.It was a cheery little tale.About being an artist, settling down, living happy.The problem was, it ended the same.It still ended with the me dead and the world in ruins.It couldnt be right.I grabbed another book.I became a new age hippie, traveled the world, died in a pile of rubble.Another.Local senator, ideal family, shot in the head by raiders at the end of the world.ANOTHER.I was a professor.I taught the next generation, lived content, and was murdered in an explosion.I slid to the floor, tears in my eyes.It didnt matter, it had never mattered.I was the biggest monster in human history, yet it all ended the same no matter what.If I didnt destroy the world... someone else did.Every.Time.I suppose monsters are a dime a dozen.
