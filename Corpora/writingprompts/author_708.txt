Is the year 2065 and our blue planet has turned red, poor people kill each other to survive and try to climb or destroy the 36 meters tall wall that separates the poor from the rich.Meteors fall often and destroy what still stands, kill what is still alive, not just that, but all volcanos wakened and every 10 days they erupt, there are no more trees in the planet, making breathing not possible without an oxygen mask that can be purchased but it is really expensive, making poor people dying more frequent than the rich.Inside the wall is not that different, the only difference is they have a shield covering on top, but rumours say it wont last much more and when it is destroyed they have the same fate.One day Mac was wandering inside the wall and came across a cave, he decided to go inside and explore it, after 2 hours of wandering inside, he thought it was best to go back when he noticed a big shine down a path and decided to go there to see what was causing it.For each step he took the brighter it became until he saw a dagger floating on top of a rock with a carved inscription.Mac didnt know what to do if he returned back so he could tell to someone or if he would take it and save it, what bothered him was the fact that the dagger was floating and had a shine around and the inscription on the rock, he couldnt read it and didnt know what civilization the symbols were from so he couldnt translate from a book.When he was sitting thinking about what to do a sudden voice spoke and he jumped right away asking who was there receiving the answer:

\- I am Naigra, I was sent to Earth with the duty of killing 10 people and 10 only so they can resurrect on an alternate Earth found in an alternate Universe.After hearing this Mac turned around, but saw no one, maybe he was delusional or he just passed out?A lot of thoughts were crossing his mind about what was happening.Then he heard the voice again and saw a spirit on the dagger, he asked:

\- Who are you?Mac asked.\- I am Naigra the spirit that lives within this dagger and gives its power.the dagger responded.Mac didnt know what to do, it seemed even more unrealistic than it was when he found it, he didnt know what to say but at the same time he had lots of questions.And then he asked:

\- Why?Why were sent to Earth to kill 10 people?How can they be resurrected?Another Universe?Mac asked really nervous but curious to.\- There are multiple Universes with different fates, they can be resurrected using my power.I can only resurrect 10 people after that I will be destroyed.Naigra explained.\- I will give you 5 days to choose 10 people when the time ends up come to meet me here.Naigra said while disappearing.Before Mac could ask anything Naigra disappeared and the cave became dark again.Was all that a dream?He walked to the exit thinking of what just happened, Mac went home always thinking on the matter.\- 10 people...who?Mac thought all evening.3 days have passed and only 2 left who would he choose?Well, there were not a lot of people left on Earth it should be relatively easy to choose 10 people.In the 5th day Mac went back into the cave, took a deep breath and entered it thinking it was all a dream and that nothing was going to happen, he went to the place where the dagger was and felt relieved when there was nothing but darkness, when Mac was turning around to go away he heard:

\- Going so soon?You didnt even told me who the 10 people are yet.Naigra said.It wasnt all a dream it was real it was happening, but why, why Mac?\- Why dont you choose by yourself?Mac asked.\- I must choose one person to choose the fate of the other 9.\- 9?Mac asked, confused.\- Yes, 9.You are the 10th person.It wont make a difference to you, its even better because you can resurrect.Or you rather die on this planet?Its your fate and you can change it.Mac was speechless, it was true, it was a matter of days before the shield break, he would die alongside the rest that were inside and outside of the wall, should he just choose 9 people and die as well so he could resurrect in another alternate Earth?\- 9 people you say?\- Yes, and you will be the 10th.After a few moments of thought Mac said the names of 9 people 3 residing outside the wall and 6 inside.\- What now?Mac asked.\- Now you take me and kill those 9 people and then you.\- WHAT?I never killed no one in my life!\- Dont be afraid, I will be there to help you.And, one more thing I want you to know about this, this 10 people will be resurrected in two different Earths, in one who will become a hero and the other a serial killer.Naigra explained the rest of the details.\- A serial killer?But why?Mac asked.\- These are the rules, its all I can say.Mac not happy with the answer picked the dagger and started to walk to his new fate of killing 10 people, including him, and in the hope when he resurrected, he would remember this world and could do research about this strange dagger, are there more of these?Where did they came from?So many questions and no answers.
