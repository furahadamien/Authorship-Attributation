Never thought I would ever say the following word's "Jesus take the wheel, Satan get behind me, BUDdha... man the .50 cal"

I was tired of fighting 99 other players all by myself for the last few hours so decided to join a squad as a forth via matchmaking.As usually I didn't have to wait long before I was placed with a group, as I arrived on Spawn Island I take a look at who is on my team and see that this is going to be an interesting game.I have Jesus from Mexico, doesn't seam to speak English very well (although as long as he is good and works as a team I don't really care), Then we have Mr. Satan, Clearly a fan of all things Anime and DBZ (to be honest who is not a DBZ fan?), and finally we have BUDdha, Who as soon as I joined started talking and you could tell he was pretty drunk.Well at least they all have microphones and seam to be friendly.So we are in the plane and about to drop, at this point you can tell what type of group you are in, if they choose something far but good loot, you know they are in for the end game win.If they choose high risk, high loot spot like school or military base, you know that are going for the high kill count action.So you are asking me what did they choose?What else, SCHOOL!!!.We drop towards School, and of course there is 5 other squads dropping near us, which of course also lag's me hard.Well I drop on the Gym roof and get a pistol, Jesus and Mr. Satan land in the courtyard and head to the first floor.BUDdha in his drunk state lands on the pool roof, which has no loot and you get damage when you jump off.I immediately get into a fire fight with one player, luckily he has bad aim and runs out of ammo, so I take him down, however his teammates rush me and then I get knocked down, however both Jesus and Mr. Satan had found guns and went straight to the roof getting behind the squad, Jesus took out two and Mr. Satan taking down the last one before reviving me.After being revived I get to the 3rd floor and after finding a med-kit start healing before looting those floors.Jesus and Mr.Satan are also getting as much loot as possible and BUDDha is still sitting on the roof hiding for now.We almost finish looting when we see Jesus go down, near the Gym, he is taking fire from the Pool and the hill.He is able to crawl to us for a revive but we are pretty pinned down.Not sure on what to do I then hear BUDdha yell out "LEEEROOOYYY JEEENNKKKINNNSS", he had jumped off the roof of the Pool, found a Tommy Gun and was blind siding the 3 players in the pool, knocking them all down, This distracted the one on the hill and Mr. Satan knocked him down with a single headshot from his Kar98.This took out the second squad.This leaves me with 1 Kill, Jesus and Mr.Satan with 2 Each and BUDdha with 3 Kills.We look around but it appears the other squads had headed out to the apartments and neighboring towns, So we finished looting and start moving to the center of the circle near Gatka on foot.We get half way their before we get ambushed by two members of a squad hiding in the trees/bushes.All four of us take cover behind a few trees.Mr. Satan is able to knock one down right away, I finish both by throwing a grenade behind the tree they where at, as the living player died by the nade we knew they where all that was left of that group.We gather our thoughts and get ready to head out, until we see it, an airdrop, not more than 200 yards away.Looks like they where camping it out ready to pick off anyone going for it.We start running towards the drop,  as we get there it appears we are alone, I grab the Level 3 Helmet, Mr.Satan gets the 15x Scope, and BUDdha gets the M249 (he called it the .50cal, although it used smaller ammo, whatever makes him happy).We get ready to move as the next circle is a far away.Right as we start moving all hell breaks loose.Gun fire from all directions, multiple squads.We are pinned down, multiple squads all going for the air drop.Luck would have it that the gun fire was not all aimed at us, however the blue circle was moving in, we could not sustain a heavy firefight and live through the blue.We look around, and we spot it, a UAZ sitting near the squad we killed earlier was.I through as many smokes as we could around us.We start running, and then I yell out "Jesus take the wheel, Satan get behind me, BUDdha... man the .50 cal".I hop in the front seat, Jesus gets in the driver's seat with BUDdha behind him, and Mr. Satan behind me.Jesus takes off engaging boost, swinging side to side to avoid headshots.A few bullets find us but we all escape with half health.However right behind us there is a car loaded with a full squad, I call out to BUDdha to take them out, He unloads onto the car and a few seconds later it explodes, four more kills for BUDdha.We get to the outskirts of Gatka, The circle is now small enough that its best to go on foot, Jesus does a perfect drift stop to let us out.We heal up with the last of our items.There is only 20 people left, aka 5 squads.Currently we are right on the edge, with most of the circle south of us towards the two canals/ditches.So we know to expect a squad or two in the ditch and some in the houses south of that.We start walking in, keeping near the bushes, slowing moving, checking the windows of the houses and any spot someone might be camping.We got all the way to the north edge of the ditch without issue, however that did not last long.Mr. Satan yells squad to our south west by the houses, and right before we can react he goes down to a head-shot with the AWM, we try to take cover in the ditch but a second shot killed Mr. Satan before he could crawl to safety.This is not good, the AWM player seemed to be on point with his shots and we still had to worry about other players.so we decide to hold corners and just wait, Sooner or later one group will have to move, if we are lucky the other squad will and get taken out or reduced in numbers.We are still in the circle, just in the ditch, we as sitting and waiting.The moment we take a shot everyone else will also know were we are.We just sit and wait and hope that everyone else kills each other so we can taste that chicken dinner.I look, so far 13 people left, several died outside the circle.So at least their is 2 full squads and 2 partials.We continue to wait, now the next circle is shown, it is in the west ditch, and we will have to move.We start making are way down, we are currently in the north side of the east ditch.so we make our way south through the ditch.Halfway through we spot four players, hiding behind some pallets.we approach slowly, set our weapons for full auto, and pounce, this time with me leading with the LEERROOYY JEENNKIINNSS charge.I knock one out but then get knocked out by two others.Both Jesus and BUDdha get one of them knocked out, One is still left.While Jesus saves me, BUDdha watches guard and sees the last guy, he is hiding behind the far south ramp, BUDdha takes a few pot shots while I heal with the last med kit, And then with a few seconds to go before the blue moves in, Jesus headshots him with his SKS and the squad goes down.During this shootout it appears the other two squads had theirs, as we are down to 6 players, and as the circle is so small we can old guess that its just 3 people in one squad in the western ditch.At this point they will have the slight advantage as we have to come to them.We come up with a quick plan, We will through all of our grenades at them and then rush them.So at a three count we through our last grenades over to the other ditch and then rant towards it.One person goes down, but two remain.Suddenly a nade falls at my feet, I go down, and there is no time to revive me.Jesus and BUDdha rush the ditch.As I bleed out I see the kill feed, Jesus goes down next, leaving just BUDdha.I pray to the game gods that this fat drunk PUBG legend will bring us home our delicious chicken dinner.All I am hearing is lots of gun fire, then I see one of the other players go down.It is now 1V1, BUDdha vs the last player.At this time I am finally dead so I get to spectated, BUDdha is out of ammo on the m429 and only has a few rounds in his Tommy Gun, both players are on opposite sides of a set of pallets.The other player finally rushes BUDdha, who empties his clip into him, it does not kill however causes the other player to retreat, In a last ditch effort BUDdha pulls out his pan and rushes after the other player.This must have awestruck the other player as he just stood there, not moving.Thunkkkkk, Screen pops up "Winner, Winner, Chicken Dinner!".He did it, BUDdha has won.I shout joy into the microphone.Before the game disconnects I hear BUDdha say "Jesus may save, Satan my take your soul, But BUDdha kicks A$*".Then as quickly as it had started the game was over.Sadly I never got their steam contacts and was unable to find them to add them to my friends list.If you are out there my PUBG buddies, Jesus, Mr. Satan, BUDdha.I will always love to be your fourth man in squads.Signed,
