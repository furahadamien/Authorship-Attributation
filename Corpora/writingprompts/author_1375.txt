I was so close to everyone there.They were all so real and genuinely cared for my well being.It was a strange feeling when I died, because I didn't feel anything from the car crash.It was nothing more than an unfortunate event, and I didn't even cause it.In fact, I wasn't even driving.I was just meeting a good ol' friend from childhood, when suddenly, a car just ran into us.It didn't make sense.We shouldn't have died.Ages 37 and 39, and not once were we in trouble with the law.Yet there we were, in pools of blood, dead by the hands of a criminal.Then I woke up."Yo PZ-162, how was the trip?"I was still getting to my senses.How did I just live 39 years in such a short amount of time?"Oh my god that was strong...". "Haha, told you first time was always the best.What you see in that damn head of yours?"What did I see?It felt so real, and yet it was only around an hour?"They-"
I stammered "They weren't human.They had two things called arms for grabbing things and 2 legs to walk.They were so vulnerable, and to top it all off they couldn't regenerate their limbs back!They we're not even all the same color...so diverse".JM-346 paused.He seemed to envy what I just described, or maybe the drugs still hadn't worn off."Well damn, I wish my first trip was that good.I think I got ripped off by my old dealer".He started mumbling and the rest was unintelligible.Later that night, I didn't sleep.It was so different.They weren't human.They- I - was an alien.And they cared so much for their appearance, and their people.It was a wonderful place, and despite it's imperfections, the land of aliens was way more desirable.People cared there.They had sympathy for people, and not everyone was the same.So I continued to get high.I understood addiction.Why it was something people couldn't turn back from once they started.The life of the aliens was enjoyable, it was full of flavor and variety, not clones.There were differences in people.I can't wait until my next dose.
