I walked through the city.So quite, so calm, so... strange.I wish I knew how it worked.I look at a man about to have his wallet stolen and tug the back of his shirt.That should get his attention when things start up.I look back on when I first discovered my power and would try to do something like drag the pick pocket away or even "borrow" some hand cuffs to put on him before I fully realized how hard to move things when time stops, It is like dragging it through jello.Luckily things on my person seem to be immune.I turn another street and see a burning hot dog cart.With a sigh I walk over and begin patting the fire down.still can't get over that touching fire bare handed and only feeling a strange tingle.Fires out and time to get going 
"Hey!"Time must have restarted, except nothing is moving.I turn around to see a guy, late teens early twenties strong build and pitch black hair but most importantly moving
"What are you doing here?You should be frozen."I tell him

"I could ask you the same question" he says as he reaches into his pocket and sets a couple bills and coins in the air before grabbing a hot dog and dragging it up to his mouth

"Well I can stop time, what is your excuse?"I say 

He laughs dropping the hot dog to sit at his chest level as he does so."You think you did this?"He gestures around before grabbing his hot dog and making a gesture in the air as time suddenly starts back up with a clatter of coins on metal."Tata" he says as he waves with his hot dog as he does the gesture in reverse and begins walking away 

"I don't stop time?"I say in disbelief 
He turns with a look of surprise "have you, have you experienced every freeze?""Ya"

"I've been freezing time every day for almost a year now, and you are just NOW realizing you wern' t controlling it?Wow.I'll just be going then.Bye."And he walked off as my understanding of the world crumbled
