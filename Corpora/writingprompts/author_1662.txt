TenaciousFeces
I scanned the demon before me, with its black, vacant eyes, its toothpick legs, and its body covered in feathers.My other ingredients spread out on the counter, I quickly searched them for something to throw.Where was my citrus?Then I glanced down at my grocery list for "summer lemon chicken" and notice that my own aweful handwriting was probably the problem.In "summer" my "e" looked like an "o", my "r" was more of an "n", plus I had somehow added a flourish to my "l" that turned it to a "d".Crap, that's why I don't have any lemons.
