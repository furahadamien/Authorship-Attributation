#1.My mug, despite all this time, years after the rankings came out, and I was still number one.I didn't deserve it, frankly.I only gave my kids everything they deserved.The real #1 father was the one working 3 jobs just to take care of his kids.The ones that stayed up extremely late to help their kids with their homework.Those were the #1's in my opinion.I never slaved to provide for my 3 kids, and I wasn't anything special, just a normal person like everybody else.I gave my children an education, I gave them the tools to succeed, but I didn't treat them line they were better then everyone else, and taught them to be humble.So why does my mug say #1?Hi, my name is Bill Gates, and this is my story.
