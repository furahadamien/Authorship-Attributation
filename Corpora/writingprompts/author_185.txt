Ninja have been dead for centuries.That's what everyone out in the sunlight believes, and we make sure it remains that way to this day.Ninja have been evolving in the 21st century.They're becoming skilled in more than just the arts of stealth and combat.Cyber warfare is huge, and we have all of the data.Russian, American, British, Mexican, even the North Korean data comes to us, and if we see it fit it gets sent out under the mention of an anonymous tip, or filtered through some politicians.Japan is the problem child in our great big family.The ninja there have yet to gather ANY useful information from the Japanese government.This is mostly due to them refusing to wear plainclothes and instead dressing in the stereotypical ninja wear that you'd see in movies.Black mask, black clothes, sword on hip, etc.The Russian division is insisting we move in soon to take over, because currently Japan is our wildcard.We move at daybreak.
