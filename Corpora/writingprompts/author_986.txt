It took me 4 months to notice.Yup.Maybe it was supposed to be the first of many but the fact it was just one single transaction....red flag.So neat, so tiny, so round.If they could've taken 0.00 maybe they would've..I track all my outgoings at the end of every year so here I am in the departures lounge of Amsterdam airport staring at a cell in my spreadsheet.- 10??Blank blank.The date was September 9th 2017.3.42a.m What the hell?What was I doing on that very day?I was in hospital, recovering from a broken ankle sustained from a freak cycling accident in the park.So it's a scam, take ten bucks from a random account...no one will notice.Take it from thousands of accounts...well throw me a boomerang...how much did he make?Probably millions.Sonofa.Probably more than the 84k I've got anyway.Some random kid in a hoody drops off a thick envelope and moves off.I take a peek.Names and bank accounts...all minus 10.There's at least 400 sheets here.All the entries have the same date.But the times are different because the bank account holders are from all over the world.It cost me 8k to get this info.Money well spent.Adjusting for the time difference gives me a location.London.76k left.Paying to follow the trail leads me to a pub just south of Waterloo bridge.Here another anonymous dude in a hoody deposits another envelope in my lap.There's just a single pink post it note inside.I study it over a bowl of scratchings and lukewarm beer.I have an address and a name.I call a cab.The following morning the news reports will exaggerate the death of a man who died of apparent overeating in a seventeen day binge.But this time the reports are disappointingly bland.Later forensic analysis and post mortems reveal that one Terry Kaspociwz died of internal bleeding.It took a while to break the 76k down, repeated blending was required.It took even longer to reverse the transactions.However you can have your cake and eat it Terry.The other victims had their 10 bucks returned.They'll never notice but I did.
