The night was stupidly warm, as all Christmas nights are in Australia.Though, the storm that accidentally visited my door and blundered through the shrubs was a welcome change, causing me to swap from a roaring fan to an open window.However, this brought in another problem: mosquitoes.As one zipped by, my arm reflexively whipped at my neck, trying to catch the bugger with an open palm.**WHAP.** Fuck.Missed.Despite that, I continued on, lightly scrolling through Reddit to ease my mind off of the heat.There, I spotted a little note from
>"[WP] you are yourself, on Christmas Day, reading this on reddit, you are told that you are loved and accepted for who you are, and to have a happy holiday season, and a great new year!""Fuck off!Can't tell me what to do."I said to myself, as if the prompter can hear it through the monitor, like some odd version of 1984.And so I scrolled on, while flicking to another tab to slip into Youtube and listen to that one Ghost song that keeps worming back into my head.Bit of a plague, that, but it doesn't bother me any.Unlike these bloody mosquitoes.Arm.Fling.**WHAP**.Fuck.Missed.
