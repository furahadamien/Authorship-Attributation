Why would you fear me?I help you see who you really are.I help you understand what is.You had a choice, now you're mine.I think you haven't quite grasped the consequence here, the foulness of what been thought, the forsaken acts you chose so eloquently inside the smirk you never fully formed.Run and hide in the corners of your mind, then face me in terror, so drab...

What's this?You want to go back to your life?Oh, so cute, let's see some blood...The drops of thick red bio coalesce with my hand, the thoughts of doom rise through your pupils.My one moment of rejoice, the moment of pleasure, the moment you succeed in passing, finding fractal prime, beckoning the sound of home.We split time in a superimposed setting where meaning of self and relation to all is explained in detail in milliseconds.The energy is tense and taught.The dielectric flow becomes smooth and free flowing.I can trace the path of attraction for what's left of your energy to follow, the shadow of plasma in essence of DNA.Loving all life immensely is my way, more than you'll know.I want your time in 'Life' to be fore-filling and fruitful.Play hard, work hard, die hard.Your placed back in the perfect branching tree of consciousness with care, with subtle ease.Bring me your life as I am holding your salvation in final regard, from the chief in staff.Before me, all is transparent when brought forth from sin.Some are cast from iron, from Saint to Nephilim to Seraphim to Arch Angel, we will guide those with conscientious thoughts, all those apposed should rethink their position or find their resting place dark and foreboding.Azrael
