I sat alone, leaning against a billboard, beer in my hand, looking down at the vast city below.The lights twinkled and flickered, it was all really beautiful, but regardless of what beauty was in front of me, I would never be able to escape the burdens of my past demons...the burdens of a once forgotten love...

See the thing is, Lilly and I go far back.I knew her since elementary school; she was the quiet girl in the back of the class that would look at flowers during lunch.Lilly never seemed to talk to anyone or have friends, so it was quite a surprise when we found ourselves as a couple in middle school.Her life on the outside seemed ideal to most of us, two wealthy parents in a suburban neighborhood.White picket fence, everything a young girl could wish for.This life however, was slowly tearing apart at the seams.She had realized only a few weeks earlier that her father had raped his then secretary mother and she had been the product.They played it off as a workplace romance to prevent any legal actions from hindering the merger that was about to happen.Her father had been cheating again and her mother had secretly been transferring money to an offshore account in hopes of escape.In the midst of this misery I told her the words that would change my life forever- "I will always be here for you"... 

Three weeks later Lilly's parents found out about us and forced us to break up.I, being from a poor family with a single father who worked day and night would never be "good enough" for a girl like Lilly.The hormonal changes coupled with her pent up rage seemed to convince her as well...she would torment me at school about how my "daddy sucked dicks to put food on the table".I dropped out of school in 7th grade and never went back.Life was quiet for the next six months.I worked in the auto garage with my father and he'd give me just enough change to go buy popsicles from the convenience store every Friday.One evening as I was washing the grease and oil from my hands, I felt a sudden drop in the pit of my stomach.I wasn't standing in the garage.I was in her room.The bathroom door was slightly ajar but it was eerily silent.I peered inside and saw her in a corner, covered in a pool of blood, razor by her open hand.I freaked out.Panicking, I dashed the nearest thing I found on the floor to make noise.I receded into the shadows of her room and watched as her parents rushed into the room and saved her.In a flash, I was back in my own life, washing my hands in the shop.It seemed like a daydream but everything was so real.Two weeks after that, it happened again.A sophomore from her high school was trying to force her to go home with him.I could see the fear in her eyes as she imagined what her mother had been through.Panicking again I spotted some bricks on the ground next to the construction site.I clambered up the scaffolding holding a couple and dropped them off the edge.The bricks barely missed her as he was knocked off his feet by the force of the impact.This became a common occurrence.I would be minding my own business and suddenly a knot at the pit of my stomach would jolst me out of my life and into hers.It was always something that was dreary and almost always fatal.That promise, made years ago had made me her guardian angel.Forever more I would have to prevent her from her untimely demise.Then came Sandra.Sandra was the love of my life and she was ready to settle down with me and start a family.She was attending college and a very bright person, but she grew up in the same neighborhood and understood the perils of my life.My job was to make money and provide while she earned an education to pull us out of this mess.But Lilly kept calling me.Sandra soon realized that I'd disappear for hours on end simply into thin air.As much as I tried to tell her, she simply would not accept the fact that I was trying to help another person.A year and a half after we had got together, she was gone.Lilly was going through a personal low as well; my nightly calls consisted of replacing her heroin injections with saline to prevent her from overdosing.As time went on, Lilly began to improve her life.She got over her addiction, went back to school and landed a good job.She was soon opening her own business and hiring a rich lawyer.They bought an upscale house and had three children.I on the other hand remained stagnant.From that moment 35 years ago, I have remained by her side.Every other woman I have been with has left me.Lilly never knew what I did; I doubt she ever will.My father died when I was 17 and I continued running the shop.I had no friends, no family.I only had a duty.A duty to guard the life of one whom I had given it to.So I sit here, beer in my hand, waiting.Waiting for the next call.
