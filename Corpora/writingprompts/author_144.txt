First the texts.Then the MMS images.Then every insta, fb post, live stream, Reddit post, tweet.Every inbox at 0% capacity as it was all FWD FWD FWD FWD : MOON all the time.After a few days we realized the vast majority of Internet traffic was solely automated spambots.Everybody else was outside looking at the moon, or sleeping all day wherever they last witnessed the moon.. 

Tritanopia is a form of color blindness that reduces the blue/yellow/green portion of the spectrum.Us lucky one in ten thousand were unphased by the moon... Get it?Moon puns.For reference,
1:10,000 expands to 
100,000:1,000,000,000

And there's seven some billion people total, so you'd think seven hundred thousand people would be able to coordinate.But then you have to look at population densities, distributive models of where tritanopia can be found, how difficult it is to travel when almost everyone is standing in the middle of the road to quietly worship the moon.Imagine being at a festival with a target audience of docile septuagenarians.You don't like the grateful dead, don't get why
everyone is fixated, just want the whole thing to end.You try making a call on your phone but it just plays Phish songs  That's how it felt.It's like not being a hockey fan in Canada.So.700,000 functioning humans remaining.All ages.All ability levels.The vast majority lacking applicable skills or the psychological tenacity required to face this world.I was only 12 when it happened, just on the cusp of being forged by the new world yet with fond memories of the old ways.Most animals that could look up and had some visual acuity also became enraptured.I wanted to help the animals but I didn't know how.My first two days I tried to go about my routine as normal.Except there was no more no normal routine.No supply lines, no infrastructure, no social contract.Ran into a lot of lunatic strangers that got a start on the hoarding and mad max fashion early.My family had a close personal bond with either the moon or stolen wholesale liquor, depending on sight abilities.A tritanopia support myphp forum briefly assembled IRL and tried to stage a coup of world power, but taking over the white house and the UN when there really isn't anyone to enforce your will doesn't matter much.Nobody to answer the phone for the nuclear launch codes, nobody to pop in the 8.5" floppy disks to get the nukes into the sky.Infighting led to the fast dissolution of that group, especially when the yahoo group insurrectionists gained traction.The moonies just stopped participating.Beat them up, bash them to death in the streets, run them over.No resistance.Just single most minded dedication to the moon.A sadist's mcplayland.They didn't eat or drink but they didn't die of exposure or dehydration.After a while their skin became ashy during the day.They went from monosyllabic grunts to utter silence.A bit later, some of them grew wings or horns or scales .Some grew hair and became funky werewolf-gargoyle things.The transformed congregation moved in packs but continued to stare at the moon.They'd only respond if provoked but you'd be dead before you realized you had provoked them.Then came the Sound Eternal.Somewhere between Gregorian chanting, Cthulhu summoning , and Tibetan throat singing.Constant, from sun down to sun up.From the beasts, from the people.It was declared cured five or six times.Half of those just lies from crumbling provisional government.The other half lacked real testing or distribution standards.Giving injections to hoards of swaying gnarly mutants that may lead to heads exploding one way or another wasn't going to work out 

And so modified aerial viruses delivered via crop dusters, foggers, modified tear gas canisters, anything that could contain the smoke.They all cocooned out for a bit after the dusting misused some lies masquerading as legitimate research.I saw the aftermath and heard the confessions but I can't tell you in great detail how that all went down.Too busy rhen with the fight for survival, a sixteen year old keeping a nuclear reactor running on a submarine turned makeshift unethical medical experimentation laboratory.The less said, the better.Dark time for submarines.Most Moonies came out of chrysalis fit as a fiddle, back to full health, lost all the medieval art features.Lived a mockery of their old routines, spring in their step.Go into the abandoned office to push pieces of paper around and tap keys on unpowered terminals.Then every night, back to the moon gazing.You were probably born during this time period.Probably not the most rational decision that could've been made, but after surviving weregargoyles the social fabric didn't have much space for rationality.They'd peruse ransacked grocery stores, exchange idle  moon-themed pleasantries with each other.Morning jog through fields of corpses, oblivious.Flip.through the same old magazine until it disintergrated.Barbers and janitors would go to rubble that used to be their workplace and sweep with purposelessness .Tradesmen could sort of resume their jobs, more or less,  but only served their own kind.After a few months, they used noise singing to gather a crowd and coordinate at a task, building ungodly architecture overnight or sacrificing a hundred mile long line of people to send an electrical signal from one necropolis to the next.They'd all look at us and they would know.They would say "better not look at the moon" in the same deadpan attempt of reverse psychology.I'd reply "What a beautiful night out" while bug eyed stating at their moon.And sing about the moon hitting my eye like a big pizza pie.They just didn't understand thar moon magic wouldn't work on my snarky 19 year old deficient peepers.I had fallen into a bad crowd of pharmaceutic redistributors.I'lll admit I developed a bit of a moon dust habit.The dust made their late 20th century satire of mid 20th century values schtick a little more tolerable.What else is there to do during the longest flash mob installation art piece?Swap rumors and lies about how places beyond the horizon were getting by?Someone - nobody knows which side - invented glasses that compensated for the color blindness, let the impure finally join the teeming masses.That caught on big once we realized us last few unchanged had successfully flushed all chance of rebuilding or becoming something other than marauder junkies.I was around 22 at the time and in middle of trying to preserve priceless irreplaceable cultural artifacts from the Smithsonian, mostly by defending an adjacent outpost and running a little mercantile ammo shop on the side.Missed out on the suicide sunglasses phase.Gave away the only pair I stumbled across in the ruins to a real go-getter errand runner.Then, next phase began and their molting started.Human skin left lying around everywhere, giant insectoid snakemen picking fights, the usual.Moondust purity went way down, market nearly tanked.By then I had a cybernetic arm and a laser eye.I spent most of my time in pipes, guarding various keys and providing clues to riddles.I betrayed everyone that trusted me at every turn and regret nothing.I had once decided to live like a forgettable side quest NPC in a sub-par video game series.But when the laser eye was installed, I could see the full beauty of the moon in all spectrums, even those invisible to the limited human eye.Didn't take long to round up the remaining twenty thousand some for free laser eye replacement.There's some logistics, sure, but you concentrate everyone into  camps, chop off some limbs, erase the notion of free will or anything but service to the moon.Turns out the moon does not mind if you scoop out significant portions of the prefrontal lobe before conversion.The question is will you be complacent enough to realize your higher calling or are you going to be another meat log for the stumpy field?Either way, the implants will a little itch bit at first.Hopefully this bit of storytelling has enlightened you.Now, please, let us experience the moon together now.

Skulls of the Hydroxians lined the pikes surrounding the sacred burial site of Elder Leslie's first remains.Five youth had survived long to enough for sacred rites.Receiving the Holy Circles marked their transition.Three proved strong enough to withstand the long time of scarification, burning, tattooing, transplants, and bloodletting.The fallen two proved organ matches for the elders in their medpods.The three tested their might in mortal combat.More organ donations in short time.The final survivor had the honor of opening the sacred casket and lifting the tracking collar to the sky.The long time of revelry became a long, long-time.Not enough filters and provisions to stay for so long.Journey back too long and dangerous for any to leave alone so all remained, hungover and grumbling about thick air and fallout sickness.The collar's green and yellow lights had flashed dimly but steadily for some time, having gathered enough beams to reactivate.And yet, no nectar.The Yamazaki-Nabisco railguns never fired as they always did every cycle.Allied Mastercomputer had forgotten and forsaken.Maybe they had been destroyed.Maybe not enough blood spilled or organs transplanted.Maybe they realized Elder Leslie has technically died years earlier, original organs no longer among the tribe but mere vat-grown facsimilies installed.The mob ended the collar-bearer and then turned inwards quickly.First the medpods were destroyed as they represented the present forgotters and forgotten past.Soon self-inflicted genocide followed.The skies parted while the final pair threw rocks, medpod needles, and removed appendages at one another.Both looked upwards in awe at the metal bird.Dual chainguns fired chocolate discs.A hose sprayed double stuff napalm across the fields.The Final Integration of the commercial AI and military AI clusters had been realized.A small drone detached from mother bird, dove into the wreckage, and returned with the collar.The firing ceased.The contract moved to the archives of the resolved.Only crumbs for the insects remained.

"Zixor the Fallen, we don't just have to roll dice to see how depressed teens and desperate housewives are," Priestess Aerosmith Daughter spoke in a warm yet authoritative tone."You will find the emerging market of independent rulesets that focus on collaborative narrative and nuance that-"

"You're just salty your many critical failures at the luncheon made your mimosa and wine problem clear to everybody!"Zixor sneered between bites of their untouchable GM pizza.Nobody ever commented on the Skeletorian nasal whine but they all quietly knew it."Sloppy drunks shouldn't even be driving SUVs in my suburban haven!"Citi the Goblin King and Uv Violence the Barbarian Warlord silently chewed their Ye Olde Cheese Dudes 7 item value meals.They'd witnessed some variation of this argument at every mid-session meal break.They knew to let it ride.The pair had an ongoing wager on when the necromancer and the elf would finally make out and/or fistfight.Zixor threw their Mama Celeste pizza box at the skeleton servants over on the flesh couch.Next came a mocking reenactment of the JV Soccer Fundraising Committee Sunday Brunch."Oh, Zixor had planned a brilliant series of operatic twists and turns the table clearly craves week after  week but No;  I can't make fortitude and will saves!Time to spotlight my Drinking Problem once more, just like my torrid affair with the poolboy being oopsie-revealed last week.Or the time the session became burying-slash-replacing the dog I ran over the week before.. And let's not forget the hair salon battle royale!""It's developing character," The princess countered."Maybe McKenna vamps and chews the scenery a bit, but what do you expect from a former homecoming queen cheerleading captain drama club president on her second unfulfilling marriage going through a midlife crisis?""For her to get her shit together a little.Maybe interact with the other members of the Committee instead of going on these personal sidequests.""Oh.Oh my. "Citi piped up."Taking over the goth teen wannabe wiccan, formerly known as GM-PC #17, doesn't have a lot of plot hooks for me to explore.Oh, other than begrudge her upper middle class luxury and watch The Craft on blu ray.Oh, I'm thinking her mom has been dragging her to these brunches so they can later throw shade together as a bonding experience.But there's enough of that now."Violence nodded."But it so true.My Cynthia has felt distant from my high school daughter Gothy McGothface and middle school son Soccer "Kicks" Futballio.Ever since McKenna drowned their father but made it look like an accidental fall  into our backyard pool.""Citi shouldn't have had him two-timing with McKenna and half the Committee anyway.." The princess gave a Bjorkian wispy gesture and scowl to accent this point."Don't forget the committee's assorted husbands and poolboys.He excelled at two-timing.Twice over.Two-two-timing. "Violence offered."Four timing.To the power of four.At minimum," Citi smiled a wicked lil grin."Oh That's how I likes to play them - high charisma and seduction.Oh my.And oh, once I levelled up I would've used the Black Widow feat to slow motion genocide the entire town, one lover at a time, boosting my vigilant criminal watch stats in exchange for humility and humanity points I don't even need.Oh, it was so fiendishly clever!Leading the manhunt on myself.A pity I died before my time."I am ever so weary of making a new character every other session.Nobody else has died yet.The inept detective needs to stop his moonlit strolls with Cynthia and start finding all my corpses.Oh, can I be a coroner after Gothy dies in a bathtub under mysterious McKenna related circumstances?""I like that we are so derailed that's just expected, " Violence said between deep bemused inhales."Remember at the start when the campaign was supposed to be managing home renovation money pits?Did we ever even binge on the basic cable real estate twins?Zixor spent a week revising hundred page Deepest Lore  for them.""What if we didn't need false dramatics
to have a good time?"The princess arched an eyebrow."I have recently mastered the SMUG system.It can open new depths of ennui and quiet desperation."Zixor scoffed and dramatically exited for the bathroom with a loud drop of a Plus Two Scepter of the Undead.What does an elf know of desperation?Citi and Violence exchanged glances."They have a splat on something  called podcasting,"" Aerosmith Daughter continued."No more purpose driven addiction-prone yuppies.Now you are tubby underemployed thirtysomethings that share meandering conversations and aged pop culture references.It's all only tangentially related to the topic that brings us together and each one ends with either begging for money or describing mattresses and undergarments delivered regularly by municipal kingdom servants.""So what would we talk about?""So glad you asked.I shall soon self-publish a meta-narrative module that I wanted us to playtest.The characters review game books of their realm meant to emulate our own world.And maybe movie reviews.There can never be enough movie review podcasts."Citi and Violence nodded in unison."Can we be severely depressed and self-deprecating?Carry the weight of the long slog of life's constant little failures and setbacks?Can we overinvest ourselves in our hobbies to the detriment of the rest of our lives?Suffer faulty equipment ?Attend gatherings of similar aimless souls?""I see you intuitively understand the format."Meanwhile, Zixor tried to drown in the bathtub but came back as a lich.Snuck out the bathroom window to find a table that appreciated a good railroading.
