And the light of the morning streamed in, illuminating Harry's track-mark scabbed arms, as he lay outstretched in the vomit-stained mattress where he found his only peace, in the corner of an empty room in a long abandoned warehouse in Hackney.Harry woke up, coughing, as the sunlight reached his eyelids.He wiped the sweat from his face with his blanket and sat, holding his head in his hands.He was desperately trying to cling onto his dream.It was about something really important.But his old Nokia made a sound, interrupting him, and he tilted his head to read the screen - "17 unread messages from: Hans van Voldemort".His stomach twisted as reality came back to him.If he didn't get Voldemort's money by the end of the day, he was fucked.He staggered to his feet and into the next room where Dumbledore was asleep wrapped in three coats.He shook him - 'Dumbledore wake up.What the fuck am I going to do.Voldemort's going to -'
'Fucks sake Harry.Don't wake me up like that.'Dumbledore rocked himself upright and shook himself awake, before brushing a greasy curl of hair out of his eyes and lighting the butt of a roll-up from the floor.'Harry I didn't tell you before but I've found something a bit special.It'll take your mind right off Voldemort.Cook this up for us will you.'Harry went about preparing the syringe, wiping last night's blood away.Dumbledoor sat and alternated between smoking and coughing until everything was ready.'You go first', said Dumbledore, 'you look like you need to forget your problems.''Yeah, I just need a little pick me up so I can think straight, and work out what to do', slurred Harry.As his eyes rolled back into his skull, the last thing he saw was the syringe in his twitching hand.He sank back into his dream.It all came back to him.He was young again.The warehouse turned into his old school.Everything was magical, everyone loved him, and he had incredible powers.But he couldn't forget his problems.His memories of Voldemort, the police, his old boss, the school bully, all twisted into terrible nightmares and chased him deep into his mind, stalking him, lurking behind every corner.Dumbledore gathered up his stuff and left after he couldn't wake Harry up a day later.He didn't know what Voldemort was after Harry for, but he didn't want to be there to find out.Harry was still lying in a pool of sweat and urine, gibbering gently into his pillow.Dumbledore looked back over his shoulder with a twinge of remorse, necked the dregs of his warm beer, and closed the door of the warehouse behind him.
