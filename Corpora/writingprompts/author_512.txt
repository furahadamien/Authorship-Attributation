Honestly, I always liked the idea of being like my father, he took care of me, my sis and my lil bro.The man raised us three into great people, I always wanted to be like my dad.Sadly, life wasnt that kind to me, in the words of the doctor as I had a check up on my health

There is no shame in it sir, some people just werent made to have children 

I know the man didnt meant anything bad with that, but well, nothing I could do, nothing bad with being sterile.Nothing bad with that

My coworkers in the office found out about it, some joke about it, some others just said sorry.One, one decided it would be fun to give me a mug that said #1 Dad I wanted to throw the mug and break it in pieces.But I didnt, no, I simply left it in my desk and took it with me back to my apartment.I did my routine of everyday, work, cook, rest, and visit the kid in the park.You see I often visited a kid in the park who I played chess against.Kid you not, he is better than any of my coworkers.Kid knows how to play chess, Im still not sure how it happened.We just started to play a game in the park, I set the chess board and he sat against me.A couple of hours later we decided we would play every day.I dont know what pulled me to play with the kid, but in a way, I saw my lil bro in the kid.Robert had always been one to play board games against me, but different from Robert this kid could make me bite the dust.And that is how every day after work I would play with Alex on the park and buy something for him to eat.I was sure the kid was living on the streets, I didnt have any idea of how he survived, I dont think I could keep it up like him.Maybe thats what made me push the subject and offer to adopt him about three months after our first contact.The day the coffee mugs started to show the number in ranking of the fathers all around the news were excited to look for the #1 Dad, who could that guy be?My mug changed thats for sure.It didnt show a ranking number, in something totally different, mine got white.The porcelain white mug didnt have anything written in it.Not that I care though

Im going to class dad 

Be careful out there Alex 

The hug of the kid made me feel like the number one dad.Some people arent made to have children, but everyone can be a father.Hope you are proud dad, Im just like you.
