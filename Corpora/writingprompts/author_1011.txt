"Hello?!..... Please-Please wait!"Half awake and practically falling out of my sleeping bag I slammed open the door and screamed again."PLEASE COMEBACK!WHERE CAN I FIND YOU!?HOW DO YOU KNOW?!?PLEASE WHY ME?!?!"DO YOU HAVE FRESH WATER?!It was Too late.Once again they were gone, and The unmistakable buzzing of the delivery drone was fading off into the distance."Do YoU hAvE FrEsh WaTeR?!"I mocked myself audibly as i picked up my monthly delivery.To most that question may not seem too daft at a time like this, but my situation is not like most.Obviously they had water because you need water to make Oreos.I  remember Squinting to read and fill out that Highlights Magazine insert in Dr. Holdens' office.It was titled LIFETIME OREO GIVEAWAY I was 6 years old in for my yearly physical.All i was thinking about was mountains of Oreo cookies and a trip to a real factory.When i got the letter in the mail i thought it was a joke.I had my mom read it to me just to make sure i had actually won."WOW YOU ACTUALLY WON CHARLEY" She Seemed almost as excited as I was while reading the letter."They are  going to fly us out to Virginia to visit the factory in October for your birthday."The letter explained that i would receive 2 packages of Oreos a month that worked out to 3 cookies or one serving a day.At first i was a little disappointed.Ninety cookies a month was no where near the endless mountains i had envisioned, but at a time like this i knew i was lucky.The war seamed to be effecting everything at that time.Power, Water, food was all being restricted.Dad said they were making progress pushing back the forces in the Old Texas."Fighting a war on 2 fronts has never really worked" he wrote, "But if anyone can do it WE can!"The Canadians scared me most.Probably because the pamphlets they dropped on our city.Mom told me it was propaganda and to ignore it all.The day of my first scheduled delivery I was sitting my living room.The cartoons on the TV were flickering in and out as always.I was watching my favorite show.They even had a war time special on this afternoon."NUCLEAR NANCY AND THE FIGHT FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION".Watching her use her super powers to fight back and help the troops in the trenches made me hopeful.The best part was about to come up.Nancy always saved the day with her power ring just in time to rescue all the soldiers.She was going to say it "NUCLEAR POWER ACTI"-......

Every thing went black.The power was out to everything in the house.I was so mad why at a time like this would....

\*BANG\* BANG\* BANG\*

"HOLY Sh\^%" I blurted out.A phrase i knew i was safe to say as mom was still at work."who could be at the door" I thought to myself.I looked through the peep hole and saw a man my dads age.A tall man with a VERY nice suit, shiny shoes, and a pin that said AG."Who is it?"i asked."Delivery for a Mr. Bucket" he said with a pronounced British accent.I opened the door to explain."I am sorry sir my father is not home.He is out fight-""This package is for a mister Charlie Bucket" he interrupted "That is you correct sir?"-"Yes sir but i never get anything" i responded."Well now you do Mr Bucket.Every month in fact.Have a good day", and with that he tipped his hat turned around and walked away."Oh and Mr Bucket" he looked over his shoulder "Be sure to open that in a jiffy"

I remember opening the box.I remember reading the note.**Mr. Bucket,     Please go to the basement to claim your bonus gift.**

**Forever yours**

**O.R.E.O.**

&#x200B;

I remember being Confused i walked towards the basement door."Bonus gift" i said to myself."the letter never said anything about a bonus gift"
I remember opening the door to the basement.I remember grabbing the flashlight off the shelf and starting to walk down the stairs.The last thing i remember was Heat.30 years has passed from the day those bombs were dropped, and still no answers.359 "special deliveries" each one with their own notes.and i still have them all."Go west"- guided me from the fallout"Don't trust her" -saved me from a drifter"11-37-59" - the combination to a wall safe with ammunition

It used to freak me out, but now this is my life.My Oreo guardian angel.Always there to save the day!I sat down in my little shack with my drone delivered package.As i opened it i realized this is a bit heavier normal.opening the package i was greeted with not my typical Oreos.These were weird Oreos.The inside looked like a blue Gel.Even the note was hand written not printed like normal.***MR. Bucket       I have tried for a long time to get access to your file.You are not like the others Mr.Bucket.***

***I hope you find these to be most satisfying.These are my favorite type of oreo and figured you may be needing the extra energy in the coming weeks.Be careful not to over do it on your first go around!Oh and Mr Bucket..***

***Make sure to eat one in a jiffy***

***EAT ONE NOW***

***GET DOWN AND RUN***

***Forever your........***

BANG\* BANG\* BANG

Bullets ripped through the shed before i could even finish reading.My head ringing i dove to the floor grabbed the oreos and did what i learned to do.Trust the letter.I woke up in a daze.... " what the".... " where am I"

I remember Getting shot

I remember blood

I remember reaching for the oreos

I remember taking the first bite.The last thing i remember was heat.&#x200B;
