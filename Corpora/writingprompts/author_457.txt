I checked my email, like I do everyday.At first, everything seemed normal.However, one letter popped out to me.From: Department of Records
Subject: Deed of Ownership
Dear Mr. Fry,
We have discovered a very old record in our archives, from the year 2017.A man we believe to be from your great great great grandfather.The record details the purchase of a small star system, known as 573673460435606b, which is located along the outer rim.Of course, for the last century such deeds were considered invalid.However, due to a new piece of legislation allowing private citizens to own stars, and all their attached planets, their moons, and asteroids.According to our records, three of the planets have life, one of which has complex life, but the system has no sapient creatures of any kind, nor any border contentment, and as such, the deed is valid.You are now recognized as the legal and rightful owner of the star and all of its satellites, and, subject to Imperial law, govern them as you see fit.Wow.Owner of a star system!I have always wanted to go explore space.But for all my life, I have lived on Selene, Terra's moon.Selene is a fairly nice place to live, and I make good money working as an administrator for a ship-construction company (ship building mining materials for building them are by far the largest industries on Selene).Of course heading so far from Sol is no flash decision, since I'd have to wait for a stable wormhole to open to that part of the galaxy, which could take seconds or never happen at all.I decided to set up a notice for when a wormhole opens, and head back to my apartment to plan what would happen next

(This is all I have so far.Any feedback is greatly appreciated!)EDIT: Added space between the words and the dashes.Apparently they make text gigantic :/
