I wake up, feeling cold from my sleep.My alarm clock on my phone set me off, and I was back on my tracks.Drinking my coffee, I message my group.Ever since the last few years, we had been researching on the drug when the government released it to public access.Today though, something seemed off.Lewis had asked if we ever knew what "Entrylikita" was.No idea."Then in that case, there is something wrong with the composition of the Immortrinix drug.The boxes say it used a special safe chemical without a name, yet recently..."

I started to think while Lewis typed his thoughts.Searching through the internet gave little results, a lot of theories from people suggesting the drug had an alien chemical as the key for the immortality, yet they were only theories...

Lewis then drops the point."Today, I got a box with a strange mineral on it.All it said was the name of it, and what it did.It is in the composition of Immortrinix, and it is creeping me out.David, you should come here and check this too."2 hours later, I arrived at his home."So what exactly does it do then?""No idea, David.It seems to be emitting a lot of purple glow, though."Then, I grabbed a piece of Entrylikita, and dropped it into water.A small explosion occured, shattering the container into pieces.What was left of the mineral slowly dissipated into the air.Lewis stood shocked.It reacted violently to water, yet powerful enough to give us immortality.Then, it started to make less and less chance."How could this have been stabilized to not affect us?Our body is made out of a lot of water.."

Lewis had a thought.He went to the kitchen and grabbed one of the boxes of Immortrinix and looked into the chemical recipe."Wait, another strange chemical?It says here, another lab chemical to help make the drug better..."

"Said to become more unstable around 62 years since creation."It had become clear.Immortrinix could only last so long until its stabilizing chemical lost stability."Does that mean all of those who took the drug can all explode at any moment?!""Oh god Lewis, we have to tell the group."However, checking the messages, the worse happened.It had already started.The members reported seeing their neighboors who took the drug exploding and leaving behind that purple glow dissipating in their place.Checking the news, it only became worse.Millions reported dead."All who took the drug are exploding.The authorities cannot confirm what happen-"

The video cut off.The cameraman probably exploded as well.This is not getting better.I sat and started to breakdown with Lewis and our members.What had years ago been said to give us unlimited life took it away in the matter of instants.Lewis asked me if I knew about one of the scientists in the project to make the drug.He was Stewart, who was responsible for researching the effects of the drug."Did he ever know that Entrylikita caused this?"I asked him to bring me the box he received.In there, the sender's name.Stewart Francis.
