Some of us had it closer than we'd liked to imagine, some of us less so.Throughout the world and its history, our fascination with the concept of the fourth horseman, poised atop his pale horse, never ceased.It branched out, twisting and turning into so many different variations of the simple truth, that death was an entity, an entity at the end of the line.Some cultures thought it was a new beginning, while others thought it was the gateway to our final judgement, or retribution.There we those of us that were called "skeptics", who were simply believed to sit upon their throne of logic and denote that there was nothing after it had come to claim us.That the world transpires into darkness and our tiny blimp in the vast cosmos has come to an end.These people, are closer to the truth than they may think, yet so far away from the horror at which they stare upon.Death is an entity, a force more true than gravity, a being more elusive than comprehensible.A concept that exists as a contradiction to itself, for it can only exist if there is life, but when it does, it is remorseless.It cannot be bargained with, it cannot be reasoned with, it simply comes to claim that which is its due.It has always existed, adrift in the universe, asleep, present in all things, yet continuing through life as if unaware.Yet, then it saw it, life, an oddity which contradicted all that it was, and perhaps, all that it wished to be.And so from this blackhole, death came to be, became conscious and traveled across the galaxies to devour all that was life.Perhaps it consumed because it saw life as an error, as something that could not be allowed, or perhaps it hoped, that it could one day be like us.
