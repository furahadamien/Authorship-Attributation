**THUD!!**

"Ow!God damnit!!"He thought to himself so loudly he was certain that someone must have heard it."Remind me to apologize to every bird outside my office.You really can't see the glass in the window can you?Well at least we know Windex really is worth the few extra bucks"

Irvine still hadn't gotten used to the bird body despite it being his primary mode of transportation around the over crowded city."Or is it Vincent?No, no Vincent was last month.I thought using the names from my favorite videogames would make this identity thing easier" He spotted her in her usual place walking through the park after her day at work and drifted down to a remote corner in the trees to phase back into being a human.Shaggy black hair, little bit of facial shadow, eyes some kind of hybrid of green and brown, medium build."Alright, let's try this again" he said with a deep sigh and walked out on the trail.**THUD!!**

"Oh my god I'm so sorry" he said kneeling down to scoop up the papers that had been scattered running into Isabel.The Apple of Aries' eye.For months they'd been dating on and off.Unbeknownst to her of course.To her, Serge was just another klutz who spent too much time looking at his phone and not enough time watching where he was going."If I don't text my mom right back, she starts to panic and next thing I know the police are knocking on my door.Or asking the receptionist at the gym if I've checked in.It's happened more than once.""Oh, that's alright.Thank you" She said with a sparkle in her limpid blue eyes that Leon had never seen in anyone else before.Maybe it was that, that drew him to her.She seemed unremarkable in nearly every other way, but in a way that seemed deliberate.As if she was trying to hide something amazing about herself from the outside world."I'm Andrew" said Dante extending his hand with the palm facing a little more upward than someone who would be shaking the hand of a person they just met.He knew her hands were soft.He knew she would place her delicate fingers in his palm and he would close his hand around them.With no small amount of luck, or tremendous amount of luck if any of his past attempts were any indication, he'd hold her hand every day."Isabel" she responded.It was a dance he'd done countless times before and he knew each step of each beat.He was a virtuoso at this point.After days upon weeks upon months of practice, he could do it from muscle memory.Asking the right questions, peaking the right interests, but not so much as to seem too good to be true or come off as a stalker who was just sizing up his next victim."Are you thirsty?It's been a long day for me and I'm going to stop for a coffee.Would you care to join me?"With a bit of a snicker she replied "No thank you, I need to be on my way.I've got a few projects I need to get the ball rolling on."The glisten he saw in her eyes, like a lens flare in a movie made the hair on his neck stand."Oh.. well..It was nice talking to you Isabel.Sorry about earlier again.""Oh don't worry about it, have a nice day" she giggled and went on her way.Defeated he walked into the coffee shop, so as to not seem as if it was all a wholly concocted scheme."Fuck me!"Duke thought to himself."I look like everything she likes in a guy!I share all her interests!I know practically everything about her!What more do I have to do!?""Maybe try being honest, and stop trying so hard Harvey Birdman.And by the way you're lucky I didn't crush you in my bathroom last week, SpiderMan.Don't be a perv.Oh, and lastly, I've been a gamer all my life.So don't think next time, when you say your name is Gordon Freeman that I won't get the reference."Tim whipped his head around frantically!Running out of line and over to the window.There on the other side of the road stood Isabel with a twinkle in her eye and a smile that went from ear to ear."I'll see you next time, Luigi" she laughed.It was as if he could feel her breath on his ear.He watched in astonishment as she walked, unremarkably down the street, with her files in one hand and an ipod in the other.Nathan smiled.
