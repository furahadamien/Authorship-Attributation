She looked at the calendar in her phone, paging backwards, counting the days.She had lived through many calendars in her life.She had lived before they were on phones, before they were on paper, before dates were of enough important to be kept at all.She frowned.It had been thirteen years, eight months, and four days since she had last seen her companion.This was the second longest they had ever gone without contact.Third if you count the centuries they had spent not knowing of each others' existence.She thought back to the second time they met, naturally it was much more surprising than the first.There she had sat, just as timeless as ever, completely enthralled in a book that she gingerly held in her possession in the middle of her second favorite library.She had read every book in this specific library thrice, excluding the few she had written and proof read countless times before having them published through the very grueling American publication process that she cursed each time, promising, *never* again.Grossly fluorescent lights that one could and undoubtedly should describe as too fluorescent, sat overhead.They flickered.Twice.The second dimming drastically darker than the first.Followed by a loud thud in the elevator that lived a little to the left of her.The doors chimed and pulled open.A young, wide-eyed, olive skinned women, stepped out bravely.Or she would have, that is, if one could bravely step out of an elevator in the middle of a library.The reader caught her eye.Not one beat passed before our wide-eyed stranger's face created an expression that could quite literally only be worn by someone who is seeing the same dark haired enigma, nine years, three months, and two weeks later, following their first interaction, in the span of only about 16 hours."I *just* saw you!"The elevator passenger exclaimed.Startled very much so by the audacity that one would have to have to exclaim an exclamation so exclamatory in the middle of a library, our La Brea haired reader, shushed a startled shush.Followed by a hushed, "*This!* Is a *li*-*brar*-*y.*"

"I'm very aware of what this is.I've read a book before, a few of them actually, at least three, one of those was definitely purchased from an institution much like the one that you're practicing your ability to shush your weary wayward traveling friends in."It is not often that someone who has forgotten more languages that anyone else alive will ever remember can only manage to let out disgruntled sounds of exasperated confusion and disbelief."Right.I didn't just see you.Well I did.Hours ago.You on the other hand, did not just see me.""I"m not sure I follow.Have you been following *me?*" 

The elevator creature talked faster than most should, unless of course, one was aiming to be an auctioneer, in which case, there was definitely some speed left to be desired."No, not at all.I mean yes, but only slightly, in a less strange way than one would think of a stranger.I have to say, it's been a remarkably long, although, not entirely, time.So you may not remember, although I really feel you should.But more importantly, you're very much the same age you were yesterday, although, you really shouldn't be.""...I...I definitely am the age I was yesterday.""No, sorry, you look the same age as you did nine years ago."Our very youngish old visitor of libraries was not only curious, but intrigued.Though, it is now seeming very apparent that those two words are synonymous and really have no business being implied as otherwise."What exactly," she started cautiously, "do you mean by that?""I mean what I said I did?You look like you haven't aged a single hour.And you should have, it's definitely been a few, if not almost certainly thousands more than that.""I'm...very certain myself that you have me confused miss.""I definitely do not *ever* forget a face" Which was definitely a lie."No really I-"

"No really my ass.I *know* you.I was in your apartment complex just the other day, well, other year, a few actually.I helped you move a shelf!Well not one shelf, multiple shelves, attached to a box, meant for books, a bookshelf if you would, and I really hope you do.""Wha-what?I don't, know what you're talking about, *at all.*"

"It was raining, you ordered a bookshelf, multiple shelves, for your books, one wooden box.It was in pieces, the sort that need pieced, not the broken ones.In a heavy cardboard box sitting in front of your building.It was pouring, well not pouring, pouring usually insinuates a body of spilling water, not droplets, though there was a lot of droplets that I do suppose someone from afar could confuse them as one spilling body of water.Anyways your package-"

"My package was getting soaked.""yes!""Someone, was going to help...me bring it-"

"Bring it inside!Yes!But they were caught up in traffic.A neighbor if I recall correctly, and it unexpectedly started to rain, although, I didn't completely unexpect it myself but the majority of those experiencing the rainfall were most likely taken by surprise.I saw you struggling and I offered-" 

"You look...exactly, the same" 

"I do!""Are you..."

At this point it should be noted that they both blurted their answers at the same time.Coincidentally, or maybe, but no coincidence, our elevated friend pulled up a chair at the same table where our very old friend sat.It would be weird if it was a different table, without a doubt."immortal?"/"in a very rigorous skin care regimen?"They paused."...I'm definitely into rigorous skin care regimens, passionately so but, did you just...just ask me if I was immortal?""No"

"NO"

"you heard me wrong.""Shut the last ever living fuck up!""Please ma'am, we are still in a library.""My name is Samantha, ma'am is my mother.Not literally.""Samantha.""Now hold on just a second."Samantha was visibly shaking, "You.Are.*immortal.*" Her voice ended in a shrill sing song.Almost identical to someone singing a song shrilly."Quiet!"Our old friend looked around."You can't just, say things like that.""No of course not.""That's impossible.Immortality, I mean.""It's obviously not, I mean look at you.""What about you!?You haven't aged at all!"Samantha straightened her button up.The one she was wearing.Much like the proud face she was also wearing."I may not be as amazing as someone who lives forever-"

"That's not me, I'm not-"

"Oh please, please, will you stop?I'm very not stupid, I've done and learned and experienced a lot of things and I'm very not stupid.Can we please just, stop like, pretending?"The immortal looked sheepish and embarrassed, "Sorry.""Like I was saying.*IIIIIII,* am.A time traveler."Samantha received a poorly stifled laugh in response."Listen hear Miss-"

"Lana.Miss was my mother.Not literally, well almost.Her name was Missy.""Well, Lah-nuh."Both syllables of the name were overly pronounced."I *am* a time traveler and I saw you yesterday and you obviously do not believe me,as I now realize more as I finish this sentence and continue to see you holding back more laughter.For an immortal, I feel you'd be more open to the possibilities-"

"SHH"

"I am sorry but I am hurt.But not really.But what I can really do really, is this" 

At this point, Sam, as she is known by, to her close friends, (don't you and I feel very included and special at this moment) reached for her watch.She turned the minute hand ever so slightly as Lana watched attentively and disbelievingly.She then grabbed Lana by the wrist with her wide beautiful eyes, that made Lana realize in an instant that Sam, but never Sammy, was telling the truth.But,alas, it was too late.A flash of light, flashes, a few lights.Lights that were too fluorescent, we've been here before, which is kind of the point.They were standing behind some bookshelves, shelves attached to boxes to hold books.Watching Lana watch Samantha come out of the elevator."Holy, FUCK.Take us back" 

Lana and Samantha looked back in their direction.Not their direction but their other direction, the direction of Lana and Samantha, and saw nothing.Sam had already taken them back."So now you believe me"

"What the hell?""I time travel," she whispered."WHY?""Because well, my time is no good you see, I don't like it, I don't fit in, I just, had to leave.""So you just go everywhere, on a whim?Isn't that dangerous.""Hey, wait, no, hey.I'm not an amateur okay?I know how this works, I know what I'm doing, okay?I've been doing it for years, and not day years but real years.""I'm at a loss for words.""Well, not those words.""You very much so like picking at almost everything.""Yes, almost, not quite everything.""So why here, why now" 

"No reason, no reason ever, reasons don't matter, just go to go and do to do, your questions are boring" 

"Well what's a non boring question to ask?"Samantha sheepishly smiled.Partly at that alliteration, "Will you...would you...it's more of a favor really.It's just that...well you see...I don't really know what happens between the years that i travel.Well that's not true, I do know, but only from data and research and papers and computers and I want to know what it's like, what it feels like, I want to know the most primary of primary sources and I never have, and well that's not a boring question or favor I don't think, if it's too much I understand.I just don't want to feel like I'm missing out, time traveling you see everything but still miss so much you see, and I just, don't want to miss that much if I can help it and-"

"Nine years ago," Lana thought."Well there was this earthquake, very large, I'm sure you've heard of it, or at least know of it..." Lana continued.Samantha relaxed her shoulders and her eyes glistened and she smiled and hung on to every one of Lana's words.Thus starting the most unique friendship possible.
