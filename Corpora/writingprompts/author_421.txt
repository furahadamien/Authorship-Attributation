Their fields are empty, white wastes sowed with the salt of the long years.For all the miles they could see, they see nothing but an endless world.This should please them, you would think.But there is something coursing through the air, a wind rising in the heavens above.Maybe they can taste it.Perhaps that is why they cry.They can feel their abandonment.The world watches for I know I am not the only eyes.In our towers in the Far World, we see the specks roam, little mites mustering the courage to leave their bunkers.See how the light hits them.See their flag fly high in the open lands.*America,* I think.Long ago, my family was American.I feel some sadness to them.The gates to heaven have closed.Our world is leaving, and our goodbyes nearly spent.But see them come.See the war torn land all brown and turned, stony and wild.Look at them look for us.See the mites fall in confusion.And if you hear my words and sense some bitterness in them, then I shan't pretend to hide it.The War had taken much from me.All that I loved is gone.But such is war.And such was the American war.And if you hear my words and my words echo in the stillness of the deserted lands, then let me explain.For you are unlucky, perhaps even a child, born innocent, condemned to die.For that you deserve some solace.Solace is all I can give.When the War had ended, half the world had died.Their screams and chemical shadows haunted the peace, and what talks were held were facetious.We knew this world was gone.What good was dismantling bombs when the knowledge would forever remain?We had to leave.The Sun was growing warmer, the days going quicker in the silence of burying the dead.We had to leave.After the War ended what countries remained made a very hard decision.We banded together after Lucifer's Week.That was the week where a new bomb fell every day.We decided everything had to end.For humanity to survive, we would have to leave our human home.This we agreed with heavy hearts.And we gritted our teeth and negotiated with the Americans.If you are reading this amidst the lonely plains, then know we negotiated with your fathers.We gave them everything they wanted, placated their fancies, and pleaded and begged in all the right ways for just one  favor: for us all to isolate ourselves for fifty years.The Americans thought they had won.You all could never accept the idea of loss, or even *compromise*.And so they agreed.They thought in the dark, with all the world fragmented, they would grow even more powerful.And perhaps they have.But we had deceived them.In those fifty years they had caged themselves, and we worked freely on creating vast ships to take us off this failing planet.Cancers are on the rise.Most lands are dead, barren like so many women who were cowed in the final bunkers.Most lands are dead, same as those women.Same as my only love.And we have built great towers in what pockets of life that still remain.Great spires to the heavens house our ever readying ships.And now as the nights come cold and the frost heavy with the ghosts of the dead, and the heavy feeling of time running out, we have completed those ships.We ready ourselves for the journey come.Just as You have awakened.So now see the American stretch.See how the land sprawls in a lonely plateau.Hear the silence and breathe the abundant air.I wonder how it feels.What butterflies they must have.Are You looking for us?Or is there just confusion, or even knowing?The world turns in silence.Age has taken my hair, my health and my dreams, but it has not taken that fire and that hatred the War has wrought.I listen to the quiet.I feel the shadows from the great tower.It is dark here, soft purple dusk sprayed upon a cozy idea of hope.I feel the rumble of the engines start, hear the crew announce the test has been a success.We will leave soon.I will go and leave my home behind.But in the days remaining, I look and I stare.The fields sway in the night's wind.The moon is further than it ever has been.The stars blanket the black.There is a loneliness upon the land.The metal doors sigh.The Americans come out bewildered.They try their phones but no one answers.See how long their shadows are.See them search for that neighborly love.I wonder what they think.I wonder if they know.The ships will leave the day after tomorrow.The Sun will eat this Earth.We have burned all our intelligence, and have left no hope as to where we will go.Let the Americans have this planet.Let the temperature rise and engulf them.Perhaps their sweat shall stay their tears.But let them have this world.They have fought so hard for it.And let them look to the sky as we leave.See them look in hope at the marvel of the shooting stars.Let them wish for a good life and for contact as soon as possible.Give them their hope.It is all they have.-

Burning debris littered the sky, as though a wall of hate against us, climbing higher and higher.The shadows grew into reaching arms, hiding the true enemy we tried to outrun: Man.But to say that is facetious, I suppose.What enemies had we that we did not cultivate ourselves?The pot had boiled over and the world was full of steam and hate.They needed someone to batter, to release all the hell we put them through.Sirens flared behind.The police cars were gaining."Hurry Christ!Goddamn it hurry!""Oh Father, oh Father, oh Father..."


He could not drive.He was a short man.His hair was oily, thick and short.*Had you cared to come back, they would not have accepted you,* I thought.I felt almost sorry for him."Can't take the heat?"said Lucifer.Of all of us he was the one who enjoyed.They did not have to believe in him when they acted out his will freely."Why are you even here?"I asked him."You cannot die.""Why are you here?"he asked.Gunshots rang like nearby thunder.The sky was red and dark."I...I..."


I did not know how to answer him.I was a man.I had no memories from before.I had awoken with them, us failures."A man amongst gods!"Lucifer screamed.Buddha was firing.I wondered why he would do that.Was he not a pacifist?From the burning carcass of the explosion we had caused, there were ghostly things, shadows rising like clouds, giving chase above the cars."What is happening?"Jesus asked.Back then I did not know.I won't lie and say I have all the answers now, but I think I know better.Those were growing pains that caused the earthquake.A build up of some kind had ripped the city open.The fires sprouted in vast columns.Many were dead.More were dying.I think the world had given up waiting, or reached its seams.What gods shaped it, had never come.And then it was time to move on.Jesus turned off the highway.A bullet pierced the back glass.I felt the heat of my blood pour in slow rivers everywhere.My head hurt.*So I can die,* I thought."Why are they hunting us?"Buddha cried.He fired his gun.Rubber squealed.A car ran off and hit the barricade."My children," cried Christ.I admit I was angry then.Lucifer was laughing, feeding off my hate."You should not have abandoned them!"I screamed."Why did you?""I would have come back!"screamed Jesus."They needed patience.""I never left them," said Buddha."And who are you anyway to question the divine?"I remained quiet.We were near the suburbs.Jesus slowed to a crash on a light pole.The sparks left tracers in the falling dark.Lucifer suffered whiplash and he would not move.He was a skinny man with bony features and thin hair."Leave him," said Jesus."Let them take his scum.""No, we cannot!"I said.They were running without me.Buddha had lost his gun.They limped past the gathered few and their was a catching frenzy.Many of the people had lost their loved ones that morning.The news had blamed us already."There they are!"A man pointed his gun at me."The other terrorists went that way," he said.I backed away from Lucifer.He was hardly breathing.He would never truly die.Not in this world."You terrorist scum!"the man said.He was shaking.Others surrounded me.Jesus and Buddha had gone.They had always been gone, I imagine."No," I said."I'm not a terrorist.I'm..."


I had no name."I'm Stephen," I said.The name had just come.The man's gun trembled."Stephen?Stephen who?"Others from the crowd began to call out other names, as though I had said them."Patrick?""Did he say Mike?Mikey?"I looked at the old man with his gun.The police were coming, the wall of fire rising into smoke.The shadow monsters raced past overhead.They were a hunting black, hunting the fallen gods.The old man was fighting tears."What's your name?"he asked.I could tell he would not ask again."Stephen Algiers," I said.It just come, and then was gone like a fleeting warmth against confusion's cold.The man dropped the gun."Stephen," he said.He ran to me and hugged me.The others had heard different names."Baby!"They all embraced me, holding on to me as though they were the only ones to do so."What's going on?"I asked."I thought you died in the earthquake, son."They all thought I was another.I was always someone who had died.I was the miracle, their catalyst for hope.The police reacted the same.They brought ambulances for me, and continued the hunt for the gods.I could feel their presence within me.Lucifer suffered as they embraced me.They took him away.There was no shadow hunting him.The others were caught, but not by men.As the fires dwindled and the sky became a stained black, I lost their feeling within.They were ghosts once more, Jesus and Buddha, a memory that had been taken by the shadows.I cannot explain it any other way.They put me wherever I wanted to be.I had no home, and so I stayed at a shelter.Then I stayed at their homes.Each person saw in me something they had lost; someone they had longed for."Can't you see?"I asked, but they only saw what they wanted to.The city rebuilt itself slowly.The churches dwindled.Prayer dissolved into smoke, until it became taboo, and then forgotten.I think about what happened, and yet no answer comes, a vague picture forms.I think maybe the Earth had grown too long in one way.The gods had shaped it, but they had long gone.That shape was breaking, the Earth needing to grow in a new way.No longer did it receive the nurturing the gods had given.Too much time had passed.And so it broke free.All that pent up hate and frustration had fueled the fires.The virus of the gods needed to be purged.And the Earth purged them.I was left alone.Who am I, this amnesiac fool?There is no answer.I have no self.I think I am the seed that survives the destruction.The seed that can plant hope, and sprout new gods if I so please.For it is belief that makes them.Belief creates a tangible thing, the shaper of our world.I can get them to believe again and start everything over.It is simple."How did you survive?"they always ask."God saved me," I can say.But I don't.I have not.I am not sure I ever will.I let the questions linger and let their relief fill that aching void.They hold me for the time they have.Deep down they must know I am not who they truly miss, but the illusion helps.Hope heals, and that is the greatest miracle of all.And so I live these days for others.I listen for the gods as the world moves on.I hear only an empty silence.-

The cave was hidden, far past the roads of the expansive country.The trees and greens shivered in the blowing wind.The wind was in the cave, coming from behind.It echoed monstrous things, like a veil covering the empty dark.The line on the ground entered and disappeared there.He was old now.He had been old for many years, but he only felt so now.Time was catching up.Each breath made him away of his heaving chest, of his frail bones.His mind dimmed as though from sleep.*One day it will sleep for good.*


He entered the cave.The voices screamed at his passing.*"Get out!"*


*"Go!"*


But he had heard such warnings before.The journey had been years in the doing.Through the fields of Mexico where the grass was short and prickly, to the hardpan country of Middle America.Through the waters of the Atlantic and to the islands of brown and green where the Caribbean lingered.The red line meandered.He wondered if there would be an end.*Yes.This is it.There have been warnings on the way, but this is it.*


Much suffering had occured in his travels.He was left unscathed.But the world was converging on him.He pulled it, as though his clothes were stuck to it.Now he felt naked but it still followed.The wind carried him and he could smell the scents of all life.Everything depended on him.Following the red line had caused bad things.The green line which led him to prosperity had been free.Then he had felt detached from the world, sundered and in paradise.Now as he neared the end, he became more and more connected.Each mile brought some misfortune.An earthquake, a hurricane, freak accidents, disease and loss.*I am selfish to continue.*


Yet he was compelled.The cave was dark and brown.He heard flowing water amid the echoes.The ground sloped downwards.The line was like afternoon's light, hazy like sand.But he knew it would never go.It got hotter as he followed.It was black save for his light.There were bats sleeping, but he was past them now.Sweat caked his face.He felt life seeping away which each breath.*I am almost there.*


He wondered what he would see.On the hill he had been disappointed.He thought the green line a joke, but then a harmony had come inside him, and peace had overtaken his world.On the hill everything had been clear and sound.He had built a house there and found a wife.*That was so long ago.*


When she died he had grieved long and hard.He still grieved.But he did not fault that line.His sorrow had been pure, healthy and human.He missed her, but the memories would never go.*I love you,* he said.He talked to her often.He had asked her permission to follow the red line.She never responded but he knew she would understand.*I wonder what this line will lead to.*


He knew it would be some misfortune.The world was crying.He was selfish for continuing.But he could not stop.*I will be dead soon.*


And then he would be with her again.He almost welcomed the misfortune.The cave led to an opening.There was a pink light here.It was faded, like light upon an afternoon drizzle.The air was humid and a waterfall fell from the ceiling.The red line ended at the dell the water collected in.*It is here then.I wonder what mischief this is.*


Like the hill it was not impressive.Somewhere far away, he felt a great sadness.As the world pulled with him, all the people's emotions echoed in his head.*I am sorry,* he thought.He walked to the waterfall.The natural basin reflected a clear cool water.The line ended inside, distorting in the water.*Drink.*


He knew that would be the end.He thought of his wife.*It is poisoned.I might die slowly and painfully.*


He was afraid of the pain, but not of death.*After the green line, I am not afraid anymore.*


He believed it for the while.He cupped his hands and took some of the water.The voices of the place cried and begged him not to.*The last line gave me a long life and happiness.This should end me sadly.*


Then he thought her name.*Elizabeth.I will see you soon Liza.*


He drunk the water and it refreshed him.Like the green line, the red line evaporated, as though it was never there.He blinked and his age was upon him.Death neared ever closer and he was glad.Then that sleepiness that haunted the minds of the old grew greater.He could hardly think.*Liza...*


He blinked.He looked around and a dread came over him.He could not remember what he was thinking about.Who he was thinking about.*I...*


He knew she was important, but he could not place the name.Then he could not see the face in her mind.An emptiness filled him.All love left and he was hollow and old and alone.The cave was silent.He was afraid and was crying.He did not know why he was sad, but the sadness was profound and he sat at the rim of the dell.He put his face in his hands and the water was warm and burned him.*I...*


He felt alone and helpless.Panic took him, but there was no one there.
