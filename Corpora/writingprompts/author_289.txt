He stared at the empty seat before him.She was gone again, rejecting him in record time.He wiped a tear from his eyes.For him, it had been barely a day since her funeral and that of his sons.Hed failed again.He never got used to it.No matter how many times.They were fated lovers that neither time nor death could separate and yet doomed to their own version of hell - he in his endless struggle to rewrite the ending that started it all and she in her blissful ignorance of their woven destiny.If only she could remember him.If she could remember the lifetimes theyd spent, the countless sleepless nights entwined beneath the stars dreaming of growing old together.And the children they shared - would share, again.He remembered them, too.They were his personal burden, memories and pain that only he knew existed.He bore it willingly, no matter the grief that inevitably fell to him alone to bear.He glanced at his watch, the time was about right.He needed to get back to the machine.The machine that was both a curse and a blessing.He would make it work this time.Hed try something else.He hailed a cab outside the restaurant.As he rode through the rain swept streets of the city he silently hoped the next jump would bring him to someone a bit more to her liking.A short while later he was back in his lab.The machine sat before him, humming in its usual patient manner.With a quick motion he adjusted the knobs, as he had done so many times before, and gripped the conductive rods to either side.The humming grew in intensity.The building around him began to shake.He grimaced as electricity coursed through his body.He squeezed his eyes shut as he held on to the machine with all his might.His last thoughts before the pain overwhelmed him was of her.He would start again.And this time would be the last.
