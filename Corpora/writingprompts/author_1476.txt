I have to stop.Hey you!Your better than this.Your lungs are black and you disgust yourself .You don't have to be like your mother .You don't have to be wrinkled and coughing.You don't have to be controlled by the nicotine.You have a choice.Quit or find yourself hating you for the next 20 years.Quitting these helps you find other passions.Do it now.It's just a commitment.
