Aaron was not the brightest of vampires.His usual approach to the Council was apologetic at most.When he broke the rules (most of his daily endeavours) the Council continued, somehow, to retain faith in him.My latest attempt at convincing them otherwise proved to be a failure once again."I'm so, so sorry guys.I didn't know he was going to, like, flip his shit when he came home."Sucking the life out of a human child?Not going to draw attention.At all.When his father arrives home from work?One would face the consequences.Not Aaron, who is impervious to any kind of consequence.An apology or two, and he's free to divulge our secrets once more.I think it became time to divulge a secret of my own.Or rather, Aaron would do it for me."I think you should turn yourself in.""Turn myself in?"Aaron's eyes widened in fear,  all signs of his usual arrogance gone."It would only be right, wouldn't it?"I gave him a wink and a grin.The idiot couldn't have formed his own full sentence if he tried.This would be easy."The Council has planned a takeover of the prison system.With the increased media coverage we've decided to be slightly more aggressive."I checked around me to make sure no-one was listening, and lowered my voice a notch just in case."When you are arrested, convert the worst criminals you can find.Serial killers, gang members, child rapists...Together you will escape.If not, we will break you out."His boisterous grin returned and he strode toward the exit with purpose."Oh and if they ask you questions, just tell them you got in because of welcome mats or something.It will be hilarious."Vampires loved being mysterious, they didn't tell these newbies much.That same night, the first media coverage came.Aaron in handcuffs being guided towards a police car.I was paying more attention to my bowl of cheerios than the interview, but I heard him answer a question with "Oh yes, we only drink human blood and we actually get in thanks to welcome mats!"After almost spraying milk out of my nose, I looked up to catch a flash of white teeth before the cop closed the door.The Council, as expected, had finally had enough and the cop checked his rear view mirror at some point during the drive to see Aaron ritualistically executed and beheaded.I stepped out into the cold night air for a satisfaction cigarette and with a glimpse of the full moon I felt my spine tingle and hair grow in places it shouldn't.I pulled my eyes away.Within days any person with media coverage would remove the welcome mats from their doorways, denying access to human blood and greatly weakening the Vampire race.As a High Priest of the Vampiric Council I would see to it that this empire would fall, even if it takes thousands of years and more blabbering idiots.Those pretentious bastards can suck it.
