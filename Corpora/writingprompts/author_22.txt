The first one was the hardest because I wasn't expecting it.It's not that I was ever some kind of pussy, you see.I got into fights at school.I have, what you might call, a strong personality.I can be very polarizing.Sometimes I find myself on the wrong pole with the wrong guy and you've got to pick up your hands.Nothing wrong with that.But the first one was different.Appeared out of nowhere, face filled with rage, running towards me with a cleaver in his hand and murder in his eyes.If I hadn't been reading letters the night before, the letter opener wouldn't have been on my bedside table.I still would've grabbed his forearm when the cleaver came down, but I wouldn't have had anything to plunge into that bald fuck's ribs.I probably wouldn't have walked out of that bedroom.But I had the letter opener and then I had a bald corpse of a man bleed to death on my bedroom floor with no idea of who he was, why he wanted me dead or how the fuck he got into my room in the first place.Windows and doors locked.One moment he wasn't there, the next he was.It wasn't until I had hidden the body that I started really thinking about that part of it.. you know, where he had come from.That was the hardest thing to figure out.Luck had it though, I didn't have to think about it long because his buddy showed up not longer than that.I didn't have the letter opener in my pocket because I thought I would need it again, I just didn't want to have to rely on luck again.When I realized this wasn't going to stop, I traded the letter opener for a trench knife and then the trench knife for a pistol.The second one came a month after the first.The third came a week later.I would say they've been coming every day now, but I had to kill two yesterday.They always show up right near me and they seem to be a little disoriented when they arrive.That gives me the advantage.A slash to the throat, a plunge in the back, or these days, a bullet to the brain.Then I'm on my way again.A new house if no one was around.A new town if someone might've seen.I never sleep anymore.Sometimes I close my eyes for a few minutes but I can still hear everything.A crack and sizzle like a lightning strike in reverse and my Luger is up and looking for a skull to aim at.I've never had a chance to ask them any questions.They never have much to say, but they all seem to know my name.They all hate me.I can see it in their eyes.I don't know if I'd call this a life anymore.I am just trying to survive long enough to figure things out, but I spend all my time surviving and the time for figuring seems less and less.So that's why I left my Luger on the park bench downstairs last night.No trench knife.No letter opener.You wouldn't believe this, but when I was a kid, I had some pretty big dreams.I love my friends, my country.I've always had big ideas.Real big.Never expected to go out like this, but now all I want is to paint again.Painting always relaxed me, although I was never really much good at it.Couldn't make a living painting, but at the end of the day it was a paintbrush I had in my hand when I thought I was going to die.Sure enough, the noise like a gun firing into itself.The flash of purple light.It came around 3am.I was wide awake and stared straight ahead.This guy was different though.He was older than the rest, and had long, curly hair.These other boys looked like military types, he looked... almost like my dad.We met eyes and none of the hate I was used to was there.If you push a man far enough, take him all the way to the edge and leave him there, anyone can cry in that situation and so crying is what I did.I cried for all the confusion and desperation and hate in my heart that had developed since I started this crazy life running from place to place, murdering angels -or whatever the hell they were- that had been sent here to murder me.And then I cried for confusion and desperation and hate that had existed before that.I cried for things I never told anyone before and I don't feel like I need to talk about now.The man put his arm around me so gently and looked into my eyes.He said with a soft voice I just knew I could trust,

"You're just a happy little accident."He squeezed the brush in my hand and somehow I knew he was going to teach me to use it, and that everything would be ok.
