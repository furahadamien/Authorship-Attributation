"Wait, wait, wait.Just shut the hell up for a minute.Where the hell are Jesus and Saint Peter and those angels - you know what?Never mind!I don't give a damn about them.You?You Norse God mother-fuckers who I only know because days in the week are named after you?You're in charge?Okay.Let's work with that.""In my hand I hold a spatula.Yeah, you're right, it's not built to be a weapon - but, then again, the first weapons were built to be tools, too.And this spatula?It's made out of good metal and, if you haven't noticed by now, it's got a few little blood-stains on it, to boot.Yeah, you heard me, Thor.Blood stains.""Three of those jack-asses broke into my house.They scared my cat.She fell, she hurt her leg.The first one went down quick - this little tool of mine?It took his fucking head off.That's how hard I hit him; caught him right in the wind-pipe, severed the tissue, boom, done.""The second put the first bullet in me and put my little girl down.He died slow.I stabbed him with it, over and over, the dull corners breaking through breast-bone in tiny little fucking chunks.Yeah, through his body armor, don't try for those trick questions, Loki.Just, no.Be silent.""The third?Him and I tussled for a while, but ultimately he put two more bullets in me before I took his god damned joints apart with the spatula.Last I checked, he was still breathing - just not going anywhere any time soon.""I don't know why those fucks came for me, and I don't care.They sounded like Russian mobsters, and if I had my way I'd go through every god-damned one of 'em with this same fucking spatula.It's the spatula I had on my hand the day Nessa died.""I don't give a shit about your warrior heaven.Give me my cat back and let me go on my way."
