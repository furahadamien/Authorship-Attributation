My hair stands on end, rankled by the sudden chill.&nbsp;


A void drifts next to the bed.Odorless.Alien.&nbsp;


I sound a low growl from my barrel chest.Warning.Danger.&nbsp;


I DO NOT COME FOR DOGS.&nbsp;


I show my teeth which have ended many a threat to Master's garden, protecting His labors.Beware.&nbsp;


IT IS HIS TIME.&nbsp;


I rest a paw on His chest.My pads long calloused by the gravel and earth, my claws sharp.No.&nbsp;


ALL THINGS MUST RETURN TO THE VOID IN THEIR TIME.EVEN YOU.&nbsp;


I drag my body across His, letting our warmth combine.Exhaling slowly through my nose, I close my eyes.&nbsp;


I WILL RETURN.&nbsp;


Warmth.Love.---------


*My first time writing.I just wanted to try a very simple style for a dog.Action followed by emotion and meaning.Animals being able to see into a supernatural plane that we cannot is always a fun theme too.I'm open to critique.I remember my dogs, a cocker-spaniel / schnauzer mix and a german shorthaired pointer.I remember that on my dark days I'd curl up on the bed next to them and take a nap.We would lie back to back and his breathing was comforting.*
