Struggling, the man climbed up the cliff.It had been a hard and treacherous trip, but he had found what the wind was trying to show him.Water, beautiful, sweet water!With this, he and the rest of the survivors would be able to drink for days to come.There was a sparkle in his eyes as his mouth widened to an awestruck smile."Thank you, Life!""Kh...!"The End of Days had destroyed the world.Only a few remained, and Death was doing everything it could to prevent them from dying as well.If they died, Death would be gone as well.And so, Death helped these poor humans survive.Hopefully, they would go on to reproduce.This help came with a cost, however.The humans had recognized Death's help, even if they could not see this force.They called this mysterious help 'Life.'Death understood this nickname, but every part of Death's being shook with anger at being referred to as 'Life.'"Why, you...!"It was safe to say Death hated these humans.However, like an animal needed food, Death needed them to survive.It was the only reason they were still alive."One day...I promise, I will make your end painful for that!"How many more years would Death have to suffer these insults to Death's pride?
