I wrote a response that is way too long to post.I recently got a reddit account and I learned of this subreddit through a coworker.I wrote the story a couple of days ago and my wife said it was really good and that I should post it.Can anyone tell me where else I can post it?I will provide a link once I do.I really want to share it but am totally unsavvy and the most I've used reddit for is when I type "how to get oil stain out of t-shirt reddit" and the like.Thank you very much.I'm sorry for being dumb.
