The young, precocious redheaded girl stared at the hologram that floated in front of her from the marble floor.The video showed a man with a goofy smile and the fuzz of a beard growing on his face holding up his camera as he vlogged and pointed at his computer screen at an image of the night sky.The man in the video zoomed in on one particular star system, until a little fuzzy white star came into view.He threw an animation on top of it of text rolling by, as he talked about how it was his by law now.The text read Thats Mine Bitches. 

That was your great, great, great, great, grandfather Gilberto, said Matthew, to his young daughter Emily.The man in the video threw some M & Ms in the air, that all clanked one after the other in his mouth.He posed in front of the camera with his hand on his chin as he chewed.A few centuries ago, he purchased this star. 

Matthew dropped the curtains of their mansion, and pointed at the sun in the sky above their capital city.A few older, beaten up flying cars passed through the view of the city in the sky, but the view was otherwise unobscured.They stared straight at the sun, as the windows had built in protections from UV radiation.I know the story, said Emily, rolling her eyes and looking at her father like she was worried something more was the matter.Matthew put a hand in the air like there was more, as he limped over to a hologram.Are you okay? 

Let me finish sweetheart, said Matthew, as he laughed some to himself.Emily was never one to care much about history.She simply enjoyed the life of an intergalactic princess.Matthew took a moment to cherish the memories he had watching his only daughter grow up, as he started to cry.I, Matthew bit his knuckle with his teeth as he composed himself.I was in the wrong star system at the wrong time this past weekend.Im healthy now, but I may not have much time and I have to go back to our ancestors home star to get the treatments theyve held from the outer galaxies. 

*What?* asked Emily, wandering his way through the hologram of their ancestor as he took a rocket ship into space as an older man.His beard floated up a moment while they were in space, before he went into hyperdrive to his new home.What do you mean? 

Matthew did his best to not look his daughter in the eyes a moment, and distracted himself from his emotions by watching their ancestor set foot on his new home as an old man.He set a flag down while wearing a thin astronaut suit, as robots scattered from their spaceship to analyze the resources and begin building power plants, greenhouses, houses and more for the needs of the planet.Gilberto looked straight into the flying camera of a drone and smiled with all his teeth as he flipped off the camera with both hands.You know Gilberto, said Matthew, smiling as he remembered all the hilarious videos hed watched of their ancestor.He forgot his pain for a moment.Gilberto was a man of strange talents packaged into an odd exterior personality.He bought a star in his youth that became one of the more profitable little jump off points for life in the outer galaxies. 

Emily noticed something in her fathers eyes.Are you bleeding? she said, with a horrified face as she walked through a hologram of their ancestor taking in the first breath of fresh air of their world.A whole chorus of other people followed behind, young and filled with life.They were only fetuses before they were raised on the planet.Emily studied the redness in the whites of his eyes.Matthew waved her off.Its only burst blood vessels, said Matthew.He nodded in the direction of the hologram, as their ancestor held up papers and made them rain as they used to say in front of a Skype call with politicians back on Earth who simply stared blankly at him with unamused faces.For Gilberto, foresight was 20/20 really.At least thats the saying thats come and gone out of usage in our family to describe him. 

Stop *talking* about Gilberto and TELL ME WHATS HAPPENING, shouted Emily as a sensor on her dress tripped, and gave her a flashing red holograms warning that her blood pressure was too high.A second later her vitals showed she was at risk of fainting.Settle down sweetheart, said Matthew, shaking his head like he needed her to not act like this.You cant be that way, not if.. Matthew looked at his guards in red, flowing suits approaching from the door, and gave them a look.They nodded, and left to give him more time.You cant act that way if youre going to lead. 

Emily held still a moment, and suddenly became aware of her breathing.You cant mean it, she said, terrified and pointing at herself."Not me, you can't mean it.Dad?"You have the talents, said Matthew, nodding at Gilberto as he ran through blueprints of building up different town centers with their ancestral androids now on display in their museums.I dont mean to frighten you, you wont be involved with day to day decision making.But, all final say, for this brief period of time.. 

I don-, sniffled Emily, huddling into a ball on their plush, living couch that adjusted its feel to your mood.A few of her old stuffed animals on the shelf briefly exited their slumber, and stood up with concern to waddle over to their owner.Almost like if the Toys in Toy Story would stop pretending they werent alive and tried to talk to Andy.I dont want it. 

Matthew felt his chest a moment, before he dropped his hand.He didnt want to let it show.His silver suit glimmered in the sunlight, as he looked with pride at his daughter.Its law here, no other line can rule.Until I return, whether you want it or not, said Matthew, as the hologram displayed billions of stars, and zoomed out to display the galaxies of their empire.They revolved around Emily.This world and the near galaxies are yours.
