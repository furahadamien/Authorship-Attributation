[Poem]

Near the beginning

shortly after the 6th Day

the Earth was simple and

in communion with the Lord.-

A single family worked the land

shepherding stock, reaping harvest

giving sacrifice to God.-

I only wanted to live righteously.Second Son of Eve

bringing choice firstlings of my flock to the altar.-

My brother, only friend on vacant Earth,

took me to his field

my staff in hand his scythe in his

and cut me down.His jealousy flamed by the favor I received.My blood swallowed by the ground he tilled.-

I vowed that day to be my brother's keeper.I wield my scythe, a wicked mirror,

and kept by his side

waiting

alone

for his demise

-

So on the final day of his wandering life,

expelled from the Kingdom of God,

he would know me, his brother, wielding that fateful tool.His shepherd to Hell.-

After that day

patient vengeance taken

I have been reborn

once again

The Righteous Shepherd

never forfeiting that fateful tool

-

Now I dutifully shepherd not sheep, but souls

for the Glory of God

so they can know, in their final moments, what I did not.The Way.
