The green line prevailed again.No matter what i said, i always won.It was almost creepy.I started saying whatever random crap popped in to my head soon enough but as long as i was in the right place i would come out on top.I've won now, but i have no idea what to do.It seems i just keep following this green line and nothing changes for me.Sure i've got nothing i really need to worry about but theres nothing to do.I keep trying to provoke a negative response to my words, but i never get any of it.I can even see some crazy shit happening but there's nothing i can do about that, right?The red line is always there.I can choose to be at the wrong place, if i wanted to, but who knows what could happen?I'm sure the only reason i'm still here is because i've managed to stick with the right places...I'm getting worried, even the secret service are starting to lead me down that red line.
