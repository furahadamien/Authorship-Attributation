My breathing has slowed.My body feels so light.My soul has endured so long in this wretched and gnarled body.Im dying.The truth teller that resides deep in this body tells me so.I can hardly believe Ive aged.That Ive come to the end.I welcome the death;  I deny the death.I am going to die and Im going to die alone.I think to myself wheres the light?Wheres my long gone family and friends?Arent they supposed to greet me?Welcome me?

I see a shadow.A subtle movement in a still room.Shh, my dear, its part of the process, I hear a whisper or is it just the wind?The energy in the room becomes more alive, more vivid.The edges seem more crisp; sharper somehow.I see more movement, I sense a presence.I smell jasmine.I hear another message, breathe deeply my dear.I follow the directive, I breathe.My body relaxes further.I am not afraid.I am curious.I see her!Shes dressed in black velvet.Her cloak is lovely.Obsidian velvet, trimmed delicately in fine white metallic thread.She wore a billowy hood and a silk veil.Her eyes shown brilliantly through the cover of her veil.Eyes like the Caspian Sea, clear and tranquil.She stroked my face, my hands, my hair.I was reminded of my mother.She laid her head on my chest.I was reminded of my daughter.In that moment;  maiden, mother, and crone became one.I ask, who are you?She replies, you know me by the name, Grim Reaper.I have come to comfort you in this hour.Do not be afraid, but your hour of death has come.Breathe deeply, my dear.All is well, all is as it should be.You have begun your beautiful journey.Not everyone gets to experience a beautiful journey.Youve done well, my dear.Youve come to the end of your travels in this realm intact and whole.Your soul is whole.I know youve strived to remain kind under harsh circumstances.Youve felt your kindness only mattered to you.My dear, your kindness mattered to the stream of angels that you will now join.This is a time for rejoicing.Peace is upon you.One journey ends, another begins.Thats right my dear, close your eyes, breathe deeply.I love you
