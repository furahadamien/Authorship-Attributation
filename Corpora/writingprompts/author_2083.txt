Harry Potter isn't a wizard you know.He takes too much PCP and Dope.He's locked in a closet,
His uncle can't stop it,
Sorry my nephew you must go!Harry is off on his own,
Slowly hes running out of dope,
Finds a connect,
Ron's dope is the best,
Ron even enjoys to get stoned!Some Chap says "come to my school!",
Harry thinks, meh, seems cool.This homeless old man, 
Has created a plan,
To rob poor harry, the fool!At this school you can do magic!Hold up, quick dab this.The names it is Hogwarts you see,
You shall attend it for free.For your dope, to me, is the baddest!Thats when Hermoine had come to town.For 12 dollars she'd polish your crown,
Her and Harry became friends,
Til their journeys shall end.For when the dope ran low they would frown

Hermoine, you see, shes a brat,
She had beaten Ron with a bat.Ron had decided he had it!The cops were coming, they panicked!So Dumbledore thought, hey magic!They're not cops they're dementors you see,
They eat your heart and then flee.But do you feel it?I feel it.They're coming.The car's whistle was near.It was humming.Harry whipped out his wand,
He peed on the lawn, 
"The Dementors, they're coming for me!"Three dementors surrounded the van,
Quick Harry come up with a plan!He punched on the gas,
Dementors flew to the grass,
Harry had just killed a man!Drugs are a powerful thing,
You don't see the consequences they bring.Wands and Castles,
That trio, those rascals!It was a hell of a PCP fling.Edit: Having trouble formatting.
