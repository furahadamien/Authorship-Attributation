The city was awake to the sounds of the sirens wailing all over.Lately this has become pretty much an acceptable affair.The city does have a tendency to shelter all vile and vice afterall, too much to do and so little time left to be always alarmed.Nothing fazed the city's people for long, a pretentiously ignorant breed of mankind.I almost hated it except I had no time for hate of that kind.Consumed as I was in my own venture of picking off the scum that populate this city's populace, I couldn't really judge it's people from a higher ground.Afterall having a higher ground meant you never understood what those beneath felt and thought and hence different easily became scary.I was scared a long time but not so much now.I assimilated easily in this place where I was born and grew up and faced the terrors firsthand.I knew this place better than any of those so called heroes who paraded in their righteousness and who argued and justified all their actions.Heroes.Someone who does what is necessary in times of distress.As simple as that.Liked things simple, plain old me.But the morals went downhill a long time ago.I see distress caused only to be averted at someone's personal behest.To be a hero in times of turmoil after causing a turmoil.After being mediocre enough to be able to save only a few when all should have been saved.Not judgmental, me, but I don't like the taste of these ongoings.Time I took it upon myself to mend a few things here and there.Repaired I always had, and created but most overlooked my inventions over flashier gizmos that were more showbiz than actual function.I didn't care for that I kept at it.Now I have woken up half the people because my inventions have wreaked havoc on some of soceity's most despicable places.The government offices and philanthropic institutions are all under attack.To stop them is easy, find me, ask me to stop, I will.I really will.I had already guessed which so called crusaders will come avenging the city at this juncture.Even if I am 20% wrong I still end up doing good damage to their pantheon.All of my inventions being designed to handle and take care of all those nutjobs."You there, halt!"a deep timbred voice rang behind me."Who are you and what are you doing out here when the alarms being going off for almost 20 mins?"It intoned.Ah, Shadow Lurker has found me.Almost missed this one in my calculations.A hermitic one this was.Good guy but not good enough.He had a weakness, his pride in being smarter and deadlier than most in the dark hours.Trouble had found me.I thought about asking him what made him feel so secure so proud in this world full of surprises.What keeps this charade of bravery up.Well, not being a sentimentalist I clicked the button on the inside lapel of my coat under the guise of adjusting it against the cold and made it seem as if  I was going to answer him.I didn't as there was no point in wasting words on dead ears.Belonging to a dead Shadow Lurker who lay with laser holes on the pavement.I turned and made my way towards the safe house as another valiant pillar of soceity gasped on his last breaths.Had to hurry before my dog misses me too much.
