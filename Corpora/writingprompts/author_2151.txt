PM_ME_UR_TIGBITTIES
It was a brisk October morning.The park was full of people milling about and enjoying their Saturday morning, some were out on dates hoping to find true love, others were simply enjoying their time.Towards a wide river, many tables were set up so people could have a view of the mega city, enjoy a bite to eat, or play chess.Two older gentlemen were at one such table."Ah!Your hand left the piece!"Said one man.His hair had greyed, but still held its dignified form of his youth, his hands had a slight tremble that comes with age.He wore an overcoat with a scarf tied around his neck."Matthias, how long must you attempt to distract me?"The man who sat across from Matthias was bald, but his eyes still held the bright passion of youth.He was clad in simple monk robes, and wore spectacles on his nose.Matthias simply smiled at his companion."Just like old times, eh Monk?"Monk looked up and smiled at his old nemesis turned friend."With you coming up with some scheme and becoming overconfident in your abilities?"His hand shook as he captured a knight with his pawn.Matthias was dumbfounded."Wha...how...when..." His voice trailed off in confusion.Monk smiled, crossed his arms, and leaned back."You always did overlook many things in your plans.Ironic isn't it?You were once known as The Front for you cleverness and wit."Monk began to chuckle as Matthias scrambled to recover."Ahh...i see now..." The Front made his move after many moments of deliberation."Checkmate."Matthias was dumbfounded once again, as Monk had taken no time to decide his move.Matthias looked up to meet Monk's eyes, full of mischief."You always laid plans for certain events, but you never had plans for unaccounted happenings."Matthias sighed, this was the fifth time in a row he had been beaten.Suddenly a woman screamed, and a man clutching a purse began running along the path adjacent to the old timers.Suddenly the thief held a hand to his eye and ran headlong into a tree.Matthias looked over to see a piece missing from the board, and observed a hidden smile on Monk's face.Monk held a finger up to his lips.A young hero began running towards the recovering miscreant."Foul villain" he began, "you should never have attempted any misdeeds while I, Steelboy, yet draw breath!"With a single movement, he threw the vagabond over his shoulder, and threw the purse back to the crowd that was forming.He turned to leave when he spotted two elderly gentlemen enjoying a game of chess.He recognized one of them."The Front!Evil Front, you shall be captured by me this day!"He struck up a fighting pose, and his former prisoner fell off his shoulder and ran off into the crowd.Matthias looked over to see the young hero challenging him."I believe he is looking for you."Matthias gave a look at Monk who had just delivered the sarcastic remark.He never knew Monk could be playful."Go away kid, i've done my time."He gave a dismissive wave and attempted to go back to enjoying his morning."Thought you could fool me eh?Steelboy never backs down!"With this, he lunged towards the unsuspecting Matthias.As he reached the table a cane caught him in the gut, swung him around and threw him to the ground.Surprised, Steelboy looked up to see Monk standing know, both hands on his cane."Wait a minute, you're Monk!Why are you defending this man?You and he fought for years!"Monk's face was as an elderly grandfather, attempting to teach his grandchildren."Young man, do you believe evil men will always be evil?"The question was blunt, and Steelboy attempted to respond as he stood up."Of course!"He shouted."If you fall behind on a payment, does the bank not come after you?"Matthias was as confused as Steelboy."Yet, if you pay the amount, is it not forgiven?"Steelboy had no response."So if a man commits an evil act, he is behind on his payment, but should he atone for his misdeeds, he is paying the amount in the hopes of forgiveness.I believe this man has wronged many, but many years ago, he saw the errors of his ways, and turned his life around.His debt is large, but he is paying it back."Steelboy looked at him, then to Matthias, and then back to Monk."What on earth are you going on about?Loans?Payments?Who cares you old foggy, i'm taking him in!"Once again he lunged forward, aiming for Matthias, but Monk had other plans.He grabbed Steelboy's fist, and effortlessly threw him into the river.Monk sat back down, "shall we play another game?"He asked with a twinkle in his eye.
