"Go on, look.See, I told you, a whole month, all for me.And furthermore, have you seen the parades they hold for me?"Pride beamed at his 'followers' as he looked over them from his penthouse suite.He was staying there to observe his month of focus, a truly remarkable act from these humans.With him were the other 6 of the 7 deadly sins, and each of them was mulling this over in their own way."This is fucking BULLSHIT.I have done NOTHING but influence every single FUCKING human for, oh I don't know, eternity, and all I get is, oh look: FUCKING NOTHING AT ALL."Wrath fumed as he looked down at the people on the street."They look way to fucking happy for it to be pride, they must be feeling something else...almost looks like...no yeah...they do look proud.FUCK.""All I know is that they are showing enough skin, they may as well be celebrating Lust month."Lust stood looking out the window.She had stopped loquaciously describing lavish lewd thoughts to exclaim this small truth."Honestly, its like I'm there reveling in the debauchery.""No, no, look in their eyes.They are truly proud, albeit a bit under dressed, and showing their deep understanding of what that means!And look, I mean just look at their confidence!Normally when I choose a color, I try to be a little modest, only choosing what obviously looks best on me: Reds, blues, summer and winter colors, etc...But they, bless their souls, they decided that what better way to be proud than to just take all the colors!"Pride was beaming as he looked over the parade."Yes...I've been thinking about that.Taking everything from others...happiness, after all they've been called the 'Gays', surely that means they are taking all the happiness for themselves.And all the colors, they are clearly gluttons who simply don't know what to call themselves.They may have pride, sure, but obviously they are just taking everything they want for themselves.Clearly gluttony."The fat sin sat back and watched as the parade continued."Gluttony, look at them.They are fit as all get out, dancing constantly, and making sure they all look fit and fine as ever!How can one be gluttonous if they won't even eat Gluten?"Pride retorted, grinning from ear to ear."Obviously they enjoy themselves, and they simply take what they want because it is their right as proud people."Why...can't....people...just...ride....the.....cars...?...Why....must...they.....dance...and...run...?...Even...watching...them....is...exhausting.......... Sloth slurred as he slowly spoke....surely....we.....can.....help....them......slow....down....?

Pride hides from no one!And runs wherever they choose! Pride looked over Sloth.I suppose you could never even fathom something as wonderful as being proud.You barely even move. Sloth simply shrugged at the remark, choosing not to speak and instead remained silent.If anyone deserved a parade it was me!I'm the one who inspired this whole thing anyway.I mean, these people are showing who they love, and its obvious that having a parade meant they were just envious of those people who were able to flaunt their relationships in public.And what do you mean Pride month is about you, Pride?This has damn near nothing to do with you!They are just being themselves and being happy after fulfilling their envious desires of equality!And you seek to take this from me?How did you even get your name on this ticket?Unreal! Envy was turning a great shade of scarlet as he looked over the crowded streets.It doesn't make any sense!

Now, now, Envy, surely you know that just because you inspired something doesn't make it any more yours than it would Pride, and he is always one to take credit. Greed checked his watch as he spoke, making sure the time was right.If anyone deserves a month its me.After all, I make the world go round.Money, status, everything needed to make sure elections go the right way, the right people end up in charge, and the rich can keep getting richer.Though, I suppose I don't need a month when my way of life is THE way of life on Earth. Greed chuckled, I'll let you have this one thing, Pride, its all you'll ever get from me though. 

Pride looked downtrodden, but only for a moment.I would be sad, if I didn't have a thousand people walking in the street calling my name!Ha!Pride month, they should have thought of this a lot sooner really.
