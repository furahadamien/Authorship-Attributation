"... And to my son James, I bequeathe my most prized possessions, the tokens of the good life I lead and the sacrifices I made," the lawyer solemnly read from Dave Culkin's last will and testament."Yeah yeah, I'm sure the lazy git has tons of things to give...I mean, you could probably read from his mug how bad of a father he was."James Culkin said.He didn't love his father, so he didn't expect his father to love him."Funny you should say that, James, considering you never saw his mug.""Shut up sis."The lawyer continued."As is custom in our society, James will, for the first and last time, see his father's official ranking, after which his own ranking will appear on the mug.""Yeah, sure.I wonder how the mug deals with people who don't have offspring.""Didn't the teachers tell you?The mug turns fully white if that happens.""Whatever.Reveal the cup."Gaul Soodman, the Culkin family lawyer, slowly lifted the black lid off the mug.When the lid was fully lifted, he slowly turned the plate on which the mug was placed.One by one, the 3 digits appeared.4...6...2...# James was shocked.His dad was number 264 in the world?That had to be wrong.Surely this was his sister's ranking.But then the numbers changed to #265, and James knew that he sorely misjudged his father.Even though Dave was treated horribly by his son, James never lost an ounce of love from his father.Both his own ranking and the ranking of his sister were crazily high.Gaul cleared his throat."Take hold of the mug, James.""Give me a moment.I need to process this."James felt horrible.But then he rationalized it.His father never yelled at him, always supported him no matter what he did.Of course someone who stays a true father in the face of constant abuse would rank highly.But what did that mean about his sister?No matter.A plain white mug would be boring, but he didn't care.His father wanted him to have the mug, so he would take it.James reached for the mug.As he approached it, the black markings started to fade, and the mug started to dimly glow.At the touch of his fingers, a humming sound started.slowly, the mug started to get warmer and warmer.Then, his palms encircled the mug, and a flash of light temporarily blinded the onlookers.James let go.As his eyes adjusted to the lower light levels, he smiled at the white of the cup.Then his smile vanished.Slowly, small black spots started appearing on the mug.The spots converged and started forming numbers in random spots on the mug.4...5...1...6...1...6...9...0...8...2."James... why does the mug say you're #1,846,961,520?""I don't know, sis."But deep inside him, he realized that somewhere in the world, he had a son.And he has never seen him.But it didn't end there.The number on the mug started jumping around randomly, sometimes making large jumps, but always staying around 2 billion.After 15 or 20 jumps he lost count."Gaul, what does this mean?I am not a father.Why does the mug show I am a horrible father?"Gaul started smiling."I have seen this behaviour only once before in person.This was with a similar man to you.Thing is, he also didn't think he was a father.However, the mug knows.James, you ARE a father.You just don't know who your children are."James slumped in his chair.Guess there were consequences to all those wild nights at college...
