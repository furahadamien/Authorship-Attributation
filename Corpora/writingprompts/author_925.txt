The sense of satisfaction drains from me as he speaks.Oh no.You've discovered the key to immortality!I never could have foreseen that, the man in black purs unconvincingly.And the lengths you went to to get it.When I said unlimited funding, well I meant it, but I couldn't have imagined this.Do you know what Singapore looks like these days?You know half the city is testing centers now


I do know.I don't know what to say about it.And what about Africa?The viral genocides being waged there.You do know those are directly because of your research I can tell by your expression the thought had at least occurred to you.


I can't meet his eye.All I can do is stare at my keyboard as he speaks.He continues smiling and starts to count things off on his fingers.Theres the unrest in Europe.The unabated environmental destruction in China.Those new designer drugs flowing out of the Middle East.The Antarctica situation you know demons are my thing right..?Alaska being completely irradiated.


He stops counting and smiles right up in my face.His breath is exactly like sulfur.I choke a little on the cliche.Then of course there's the big one! His grin widens in a kind of gleeful madness.You're to blame for the depression.You poured all that unlimited funding out on anyone who had even an inkling of an idea how to help you.All of that cash entering the economy for the first time.Just suppressing the heck out of the value of, really, any world currency.And now there's starvation, homelessness, a lack of education and infrastructure and that's all because of you and me.


He gestures at my computer screen.On display is a diagram of the molecular structure of one of the drugs in my treatment.So this is it then? His voice is bored and his words show a lack of real understanding.Apparently, the devil is uninterested in biochemistry.Do you know what it's future is?Do you know what people will do to possess it?It.Will.Be.Bedlam.If you think you got one over on me.Let me explain, little one, I have traded one soul for many. This he extolls gleefully through clenched teeth.Fire licks out around the edges as if to emphasize how satisfying each word is.Im not going to list the rest of the trouble you've caused.You're not in hell so it's not my job to beat you over the head with your, many, sins.But I do want to ask something.One question and that will be the last you ever, and I do mean that, see of me.Was it worth it?


He grins wider and the very fires of hell leap gleefully behind his irises as I begin to speak.
