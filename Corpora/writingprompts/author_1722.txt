I'm very late to this party, but the prompt really stuck in my head.I'll post an epilogue as a reply to this.**Our Own Kind of Magic**

I know how to return to my realm, and it saddens me.The knowledge fills my mind as I draw it from the aether around me.With a thought, I conjure a notebook, much like the diary I lost in an endless, waterless desolation so many months ago.This realm has no earth, and thus no trees to produce paper, but I now understand how to coax the aether into creating nearly anything I desire.My thoughts transform into strokes of an invisible pen, and my new knowledge takes form as a set of instructions.As soon as I release my summoning, the new knowledge vanishes from my mind.Thankfully, my newly produced notebook holds the secrets I need to leave this realm.I stand on a cloud, suspended above an endless sea.Odd forms swim in the water  ones eye must be keen to distinguish the dark blue shapes flitting just under the surface.Beings of liquid, perfectly at home in an ocean with no shores.Above me are more clouds, drifting lazily along, following the currents of the endless stratosphere.A cloud shaped like a stalactite dominates the view before me, hanging so that its tip is mere feet over the surface of the water.Like an inverted iceberg, the cloud expands upward, becoming so wide at its top that it blocks much of the afternoon sun.I draw aether from the air around me.This is the act I will truly miss  I have only just gained the ability to weave aether for myself, and I will soon give it up.My body grows lighter, and I float to the stalactite cloud.I am determined to see its residents one more time before I weave my way out of this realm.As I approach the hanging cloud, I weave aether around my eyes.The cloud takes on subtleties invisible to the human eye.It now resembles an inverted, snow-peaked mountain with many small caves set at regular intervals.Grey bird-like forms fly between caves, and I direct my flight toward the nearest of those black openings.Just as I float to the mouth of the cave, one small bird-form flies before my face, a gust of playful wind accompanying its curiosity.I stop my approach, pocketing my notebook and floating in place as I address the creature.Hello, being of air, I say, I am ever thankful to your kind.You taught me how to weave my own spells.

Stranger? I cannot actually hear this reply.I cannot even see the being that well, even though it is right before my eyes.It is a subtle thing, a kind of darker, grey air in a shape that suggests *bird* in my mind  Ive come to call them *airbirds*.Its voice carries though the aether in a way that even an untrained mind can interpret.Not a stranger.A friend.Are there none who tell of our first meeting now?

The airbird zips into its cave.When it returns seconds later, it is accompanied by several more gray shapes.Even more of the beings flutter out of caves in the background.Tiny wisps raise the hairs on my arms as some beings take flight toward me, whipping around me in curious exploration.Human? The question comes from many voices echoing in the back of my mind.Yes, I am human.I told you once  I am from a realm with no aether.

Ancestor story.Many generations.

I nodded.This is the difficulty in speaking with the creatures.They live only a week at best.I learned aether-weaving over many generations by their reckoning, and had spent even longer preparing to open the way home.I will return home.Youve done so much for me  are you certain I cannot return the favor?

The airbird directly before me flutters, and I understand it is considering the offer.More humans.More friends.

I smile as I understand.There do not seem to be other beings capable of thought in this realm  of course the airbirds want to meet other people.Very well.Let me see if it is possible.

I am frightened for a minute.I do not know how I first fell through the opening between realms.I simply awoke in a stony desert, and was forced to search frantically for water.I found no beings in that realm, just endless heat and a sense that I now recognize as the subtle influence of aether in my mind.By pure chance, I stumbled upon a rift in the air, a shimmering portal between realms, and came here to a realm without stone or earth.With the airbirds still fluttering around me, I look to the aether again for answers.Part of my mind is still working to keep me afloat as the rest works to understand one final question.I take out my notebook, and once again the answer appears in conjured ink upon a conjured page.I think this is an answer, I say at last.I look at the page as I come out of my communion with the aether.It is a long mathematical equation, the likes of which are far beyond my rudimentary knowledge.Perhaps your children will see my kind again.

Go then.Go peacefully.

I smile as a tear wells in the corner of my eye.I resolve myself  as wondrous as this aether is, no such power could equal the company of my own kind.With a final nod to the incredible beings of air, I weave the spell to take me home.***
