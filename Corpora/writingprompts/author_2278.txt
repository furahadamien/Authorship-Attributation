I was half way to work by the time I realized Id forgotten to stop at the bank the day before, looking down at the clock on the dash I thought Id have just enough time for a quick stop.The bank was on the way, and its usually quiet this early in the morning.I pulled up into the parking lot, with 10 or so cars it was more full than expected.Oh well, I was here already.Grabbing my purse off the passenger seat, I shut my car door, not bothering to lock it, and head into the small brown building.There was a man in a blue suit coming out as I was heading in, he held the door for me, and I heard a voice call out to him make that Vanilla, Mark, not mocha, I met eyes with this Mark and we smiled briefly, and I continued inside.I was surprised to not be greeted by the familiar smell of coffee, every time I came in they always had something brewed for customers to enjoy while they waited.I looked around and saw 2 girls working at the tills, and about 6 customers in the lobby with 3 lined up in queue, I took my spot in line, and wondered if Sam was working.Sam was an office manager at this bank, we knew each other briefly from high school, but really started to get to know each other later on.When I started banking here, actually.I could see into one of the loan managers offices, a young couple was in the middle of an appointment, but their interviewer was a redheaded woman.I can take you here the girl in the middle till called, bringing me back to reality.With a smile I quickly walked over, withdrawal please and I gave her my account information.The girl, whose nameplate I noticed said Bridget, completed my transaction.I slid the cash she handed me into my wallet, and was putting that back in my purse, when a loud voice from behind sounded,

Everybody down on the ground

I jumped, started, and turned around.Before I had a chance to register what was happening, a large man appeared a few feet ahead of me with a pistol in his hand.I said, on the ground.Everybody complies, no one gets hurt. 

My heart lurched as realization washed over me, and I dropped to my knees, then fell onto my stomach.I closed my eyes, not wanting to believe I was really in the middle of this, but after a moment, curiosity got the better of me.Arms crossed under my head, I opened one eye.I could see 3 men, all wearing blue jeans, black hoodies and black ski masks.All armed with some sort of firearm.One man had pushed his way into the loan managers office, I could see the young couple on the floor.The redhead was presumably behind her desk.I hadnt heard any gunshots, so alive, I hoped.I want all of the money in both of your registers, put it in these it was the first man Id seen, he was pointing his gun at Bridget, and threw a canvas bag on her counter.Another at the girl next to her,  no panic buttons.No funny business.Do what I say or I will shoot you

I could hear both of the girls crying while they scrambled to comply, wheres the rest of it?  The man demanded, looking into both of the bags, I told you Im not fucking around here!

Bridget took a deep breath and shakily said we j-just opened.We dont start with m-much in the register because not a lot of people come this early.Please dont hurt us, you dont have to do this

Fucking Christ, well where is your safe?I want this bag full in the next two minutes or she he turned slightly, and pointed his gun directly at my head  she dies.You want her blood on your hands?! 

I could feel my chest tighten and it felt hard to breathe.I tried to breathe in and out, slowly.I dealt with anxiety long enough to know a panic attack was going to happen.Theres no breathing exercise that could help me right now though, 

Sir please do
Safe.Now.Get me the fucking money or this bitch will have her brains all over your floor
I cant!Sir pl 
 one!I cant open it 
Then you better tell me who can, two!

I was full on hyperventilating at this point, breathing in and out faster than I thought possible, and crying, choking, I coughed in between sobs, and knew i was going to attract attention, but I couldnt stop.It felt like I was being chased by a horrible monster and all I could do was lay still.Thoughts flashing through my head of my mom hearing the news.I know it would destroy her, I was her only child.My dad would become withdrawn, thats how he handled stress, but I know it would kill him too 

Only the manager can open the safe
Im losing my patience here, who is the manager?!
Mark, but hes not here.. our coffee machine broke, so he went to go buy coffee for the staff

The man made an irritated noise, and I could tell he was thinking.Luckily hed pulled his gun away so it wasnt pointing at me.Slowly get in front of this counter.I want you both on the floor in front 

The girls ended up laying near me and they were crying, softly.Id managed to get a hold on my panic which was slightly subsiding.The other man had had the same idea to get all of us together, I could see everyone from in the office also laying in the lobby now.The two men were whispering to each other a few feet away, 
This is not how we planned it
I know that damn it, you think that was my fault?
No- but the boss is going to be pissed.We dont have nearly enough money
I have an idea

Alright the shorter second man  yelled heres what we are doing.When I tell you, you are going to SLOWLY pull out your wallet and hand to me.If you dont want to be shot, Id suggest you do not move until I tell you to

He started on the other side of the lobby, the redhead.Then the young couple.A few of the other customers, the girls from behind the registers didnt have wallets with them, and then me.Alright sweetheart, Im gonna need that wallet now, this man seemed much more calm than the first, I reached into my purse, grabbed my wallet and slid it on the floor to him.He picked it up, and opened it.Took out the cash Id just withdrawn, $600, he counted.Must have figured it was better than nothing, and he put it into the bag on the counter.He looked at my wallet, and then at me, Chelsea Rose Fuller?Well Chelsea, I hope you enjoyed Banking with us today he laughed cruelly, and dropped my wallet on the floor walking back to the other man whod been looking around the bank

What was that name you said a minute ago? His partner asked
What?The chick on the ground there?
Yeah whatever name you said, Chelsea something?
Chelsea rose fuller
Fuller.. youre sure?
Yeah, man whats your prob

The bigger man was already halfway to me, and I flinched, 
Get up.Now!
Too shocked to move, he grabbed my arm and pulled me up, What is your name? He was no longer yelling but it sounded like he was trying to restrain himself

Umm.. Chelsea?
Your full name
Chelsea -Rose Fuller
Fuck.Thats what I thought

He pulled out his cell phone, and started typing something.I heard his phone chime and he clicked on something.Turning his phone toward me, he asked is that you?

I read on his phone 
Chelsea rose fuller 
Dob: 02/12/1996

Born Denver, CO
Parents: Dana & Rob Fuller

I gasped and looked at him, shocked.I almost lied but didnt yes thats me, why do you have all that? 

Fuck, he ran his fingers through his hair, fuck! 
Alright, change of plans.First, I need you to know neither of us will hurt you.That you can be sure of.Second, I need you to come with us. 

Then yelling behind him D we need to go!Now! 

He put his hand on my arm, gently, and steered me toward the door.He said they wouldnt hurt me but they were still armed.The third man, who must have been in the back room during this exchange, came out with a large bag that looked full, were good guys, I got it he told the other two, and looked at me, clearly confused, find yourself a girlfriend J? He laughed 

Ill explain in the car

I was pulled out of the building and into a black SUV, there was no license plate on it, the small man, J, got in the driver seat and I was pushed between the other two in the back, he peeled out of the parking lot and started heading out of town.We drove for what must have been hours, not one of them saying a word to me.I figured if they were going to kill me they would have done it by now, and what was it about my name?How did they have all of this info about me?I hoped my parents were okay.***
This has turned out way longer than I thought.So if yall want more Ill type more
