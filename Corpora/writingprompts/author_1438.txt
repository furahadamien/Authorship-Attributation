It was said of Chad and Brad that these two were Jesus' favorite apostles, whereas the others tended to moon over his brilliance, those two could see the son that yearned to be free of his father's dogma.Yet despite their best efforts, Jesus was never able to escape his calling.One day Chad and Brad decided to throw Jesus a surprise party and brought barrels of wine to a gathering, in order to get through strict security who didn't want people bringing their own booze they told the guard that the barrels contained water, since the guard assumed that they would not bear false witness, he let them through.When Jesus saw his friends he greeted them and promptly took a cup to show his appreciation for the gift.When everybody saw the wine they immediately heralded it as a miracle from Jesus.Brad and Chad were getting the stink eye from security and had no choice but to go along with it.That was strike one.Strike two was a beautiful Sunday, the Sabbath,  Chad and Brad thought it unwise to waste such a gorgeous day doing nothing so they brought Jesus to the beach to catch some waves.Their mistake however was giving Jesus a blue surfboard.Mixed in with the blue of the ocean the people once again thought they were seeing a miracle as it appeared that Jesus was walking on water.It was a very hot day so we can't judge them too much...The last straw came after Jesus' death.Chad and Brad were devastated and when their friend was subsequently entombed, they thought it would be a great homage to the man they knew if they were to replicate one of his all-time favorite movies "Weekend at Bernie's".They removed Jesus from his tomb and through a crafty system of levers and strings, they brought him back to the world one final time.Everybody went mad, they completely fell for it and Chad and Brad were pleased with their work.They looked at each other and with tears in their eyes at the memory of the missing member of their trio they stilled managed to smile even though they knew God would never forgive them.
