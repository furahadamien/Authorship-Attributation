It was just another Sunday for Adolf.Another, simple mundane Sunday during which he spent his time painting something new.There was a flash of light behind him, but he didn't flinch.He was used to them by now

"Were you sent to kill me too?"Hitler said."All the others were.Just get it over with.This painting was a mistake.""There's no such thing as mistakes.Only happy accidents," the man said, pulling down his hood to reveal an afro."I'm here to teach you how to be a fantastic painter.""Who are you?""I'm Bob Ross, and I already know who you are, and what you'll do if I don't teach you."Bob grabbed a pallet, some paint, an easel, and a canvas.He moved towards Adolf, and started to paint."Don't think while you paint," Bob whispered in a soft tone."Just let it out on the canvas.If you mess up, oh well.It's art just the same."Bob finished his crudely painted man and showed Adolf."See?Art.It may not be the prettiest, but I made it myself, and that makes it art."Bob grabbed two more pieces of canvas, putting one in front of himself, and the other in front of his new friend."What do you mean just paint?If it's not exactly how I envision it, how can I succeed?"Hitler asked, standing there, brush in hand.He was ready to paint."The end doesn't matter.Just have fun getting there, and it'll be worth it all," Bob responded.He started painting a tree on the fresh canvas.Adolf was confused, but tried it anyway.He painted what came to mind.A house in the woods, with a family living there.He brought it to life through acrylic paint."See?That's perfect," remarked Bob Ross."Is that what you set out to do?"Hitler quickly responded, "No, it wasn't at all what I thought I was gonna paint today," a smile across his face."A happy little accident.Now, come.Let's paint some more."
