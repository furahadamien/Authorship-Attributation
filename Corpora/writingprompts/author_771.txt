"It has to actually say Welcome.As amusing as 'You Better Have Tacos' is, it doesn't qualify'" 


"But Why?How does that even work, isn't the idea of having a doormat fundamentally set the conditions by which entry is expected" 



This was a standard argument between Shin and I, well in reality it wasn't an argument so much as an exploration of the systems by which our lives (or lack there of were governed)."The Humans have it so much simpler", A favorite quip of Shin, "They can have infinite interpretations of their scripture, and none of it ties to any sort of arbitrary rule sets."."They can't eat pork or something"



"Sure they can, they just don't, have you ever tried to enter a dwelling with 'The dog must approve all vistors', you physically can't.How real can their rules be if they aren't tied to some sort of consequence"


"It's not like you need to commit a felony to get blood these days I mean you can just buy..."


"That's not really the point.It just seems..."



"Seriously, this is the 100th time we have had this conversation", I started to get annoyed, "It should just be nice to know that there is a set of rules in place.The Humans have no actual evidence of anything.The fact that you can't enter a dwelling if there is any ambiguity should be comforting if anything.It implies that there is in fact a structure, and purpose to our existence.You don't have to believe, you simply know, and you know that other entities exist as well.""Huh?What do you mean"



"Well think about it, Our experiments show that intent of the external party is necessary.That's why just saying the words 'Come in or Welcome' isn't enough.Otherwise 'don't come in', 'you're not welcome' etc.would all work.Knowing that the external party has to intend to invite you in is key.Humans don't have that, they can't tell if anyone else is anything more than a figment of their imaginations, they aren't really 'I think therefore I am" so much as they are 'I think therefore something is'"



"Yeah but what you're actually saying is that we aren't anything other than 'You think therefore I am' as we're interdependent", Shin said."Doesn't that mean that we are potentially just figments of their imagination?""Yeah but at least you know the 'they' is there, 'they' can represent god, the matrix, the universal force, whatever... anyway are you going to hog the O-neg or what"



"Here", Shin tossed over the the container, and I caught it and took a good long drink."Phew", I said putting down the container, "One thing I'll say for 'they', their blood is top notch"



"Yeah, just wish 'they' weren't quite such officious bureaucrats", Shin Remarked."Could be worse" I said "at least we don't randomly turn into dogs whenever the moon's out."
