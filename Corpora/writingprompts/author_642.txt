ElminsterTheMighty
You know, there have always been rumors on side\-effects and how EverLife squashed anyone trying to do any kind of study on them.Not really surprising seeing how rich they all got, and how every single politician's life depended on EverLife's continued existence.The first two generations didn't really show it that much.Sure, we got a lot more ugly kids, but people also got a lot fewer to keep the population count manageable.With the third generation we old\-timers started calling them Garys.The incredible backlash from EverLife came totally unexpected \- they never had made that much fuzz when we told people their kids were a bit on the ugly side and looked alike a lot.But as the first generation grew old and the third generation became adults they just couldn't deny it any longer.Garys.Garys everywhere.Some old.So many young.Both boys and girls.And finally the government relented as even the Garys wanted to know how the majority of people seemed to become basically the same person, unable to find anyone that didn't have a face that looked so much like their own.And finally EverLife was forced to tell us all the truth.How there had been only one person who turned out to have the secret of immortality in his genes.How they found the drug that changed you just enough so that immortality could also be yours.And how taking it wouldn't change you that much... but how those genes were dominant and would accumulate over every new generation.How humanity was going to turn into all\-Garys within the next two generations.As long as I'm alive and able I will fight that, along the others that are not willing to doom humanity to this.And I have to admit that I never expected the kind of fighting I'm doing now.Every evening I take my usual pills, and then I take my special pill.And a quarter of an hour later I lie on my back while some young, fertile woman uses me to save the gene pool.I am so thankful for those goggles that change the face I see.I could never keep up the good fight if I kept seeing their real Busey faces.
