Have you heard the wolf howl?The sound that echoes in your bones, that makes needles race across your skin.My grandmother used to say that all wolves howl from instinct.In memory of something long before, in connection with their ancestors.And the dogs, they howl from the remnants of instinct from when they were wolves.From the part of them that remembers the pack, the hunt, the fury.She said what makes us human is forgetting our instincts.Left in the wild, how few of us would survive?How many would know how to stalk prey, would remember how to survive snow naked, or to how to hide from the hungry tiger?Few.Tonight, when the moon rose, it was as if there was a presence over my shoulders, as if I could hear a distant musical note but not see the instrument.For I was in the tunnels deep below the earth, in one of the few remaining coal mines, and shielded from the radiance above.My team stiffened at midnight, casting their eyes upwards, searching the rock, their eyes finding nothing against the stone and support beams.And at six AM, we boarded the mine shaft, each of us stopping at the time clock to claim our hours.That was when the cell phones started to buzz.Deep underground, it's impossible for the signal to penetrate.You're cut off not only from the sky, but from all life.All humanity.And now, just a few dozen feet below the surface, the flood began.Jim's phone started first, the ringtone not changed in over a decade, his wrinkles deepening as he stared at the screen.In all the time I had known Jim, I'd never heard that ringtone.I'd never seen his screen light up, or his fingers peddle across a keyboard that still used T-9.But now, the device wouldn't stop vibrating long enough for him to type an answer.Sally's went off next- Sally, who's screen was so cracked that is nearly cut her finger as she swiped, and who had added a case thicker than her hard hat as a countermeasure to future damage.But the damage was already done, and no case could undo it.Funny, how she didn't protect it until no longer necessary.Like her husband, who cheated on her after they fought every night for a month, and now she spread mortar over the cracks in a marriage that would never recover.My phone, at four percent battery, was last.As the twenty other miners trickled out of the tunnel, I switched off airplane mode, which I had been on to connect keep it from dying.I'd been saving it to call my own wife- it had been six months since our last date, but little Jimmy was sleeping over at a friends tonight.And I'd been saving change for weeks to take her to Gianno's, where we had first met, to share a Chicago pizza.Maybe even a milkshake after, if we could splurge.But before I could call, my phone also started to vibrate.And four percent turned to three percent.From Jimmy."Dad, you HAVE to see this!Meet me at the baseball field!"From my wife."Honey, come home soon, let's stay in the garden and look at the stars."Three percent turned to two percent.From Amanda, my college girlfriend."Hi Jacob, I know it's been years since we last talked, but I just wanted to apologize for being a bitch when we broke up.Not that you weren't a jerk :)  But anyways, if you're looking for some fun, let's take a walk in the park.Maybe we can hide in the bushes :)"

From the astronomy club I had went to once, who kept my phone number since last September."Jacob, you will *not* believe what's in the sky.You don't need a telescope to see this!"Two percent became one, and my phone began to wail.It was like one of those Amber alerts, where a child goes missing, and you're supposed to watch for a license plate.But this message contained neither a child or plate.I'd been walking as I read the messages, but now I stopped, the rest of the group exiting twenty yards ahead of me into the moonlight.I could hear their phones wailing as well, but none bothered to look.Instead, they looked up, while I looked down."STAY INSIDE.HIDE, LOCK YOUR DOORS, AND AWAIT EMERGENCY SERVICES."But when I blinked, the message changed while the phone refreshed."UNLOCK YOUR DOORS, AND AWAIT EMERGENCY SERVICES OUTSIDE."The screen turned dark as the last remaining trickle of battery failed, and the lights in the tunnel flickered.Ahead, glancing at the reflecting moonlight, something tugged at my mind.A distant memory that seemed like a word on the tip of my tongue.An excitement, a mission, something calling to me.A terrible purpose.I swallowed, then looked back towards the group.Their heads tilted back, and their mouths opened, their pupils dilating despite the light.Their shoulders turned rigid and they stood on their tip toes as their voices cut through the night, as they shouted into the sky.But I edged backwards into the darkness as they sprinted away together, as a pack.I slept there that night, waiting for daylight, the mine echoing with the sound they had made before leaving and making me shake.They have remembered the howl.And with the rising sun, I walk among wolves.***

"We are the order of the eight!"Said the spider, bending to bow,

He removed a tiny hat while prostrate,

"We're the only hope for you now!"I blinked once, twice, then once more,

As my mouth opened, agast,

A crowd forming of several score,

Then the spiders whispered, "At last!""We've waited years for this day to come,"

Spoke the king, tip tapping his feet,

"For while most would squish us under thumb,

You've proved yourself quite sweet!Our armies come from down below,

To end the human's reign,

While we cleanse the earth, you we owe,

So you alone shall remain!"More poured from the basement,

And from nooks and crannies forgotten,

From shadows, in cabinets, and in vents,

Were the creepies and crawlies begotton."But wait!"I said to the spider king,

As the spiders knights cheered for me,

"For your conquest, I must bring,

A camera to record the history!"As I fled I passed widow and recluse,

I promised my speedy and swift return,

But instead I tied a swift rope noose,

And I prayed that the earth would burn.***

After being raised wealthy, Mr. Engilwald knew spoiled.Having been charged with taking the keys to his father's planetary business, he himself had never been spoiled, but he *certainly* had seen those who were.There were his entitled classmates of his younger years, who attended university for the luxury rather than the education.And there were the brats of the rich inner circles, children who had already learned to emulate their parents.But the teenage sitting across from him, with a straight nosed butler peering over his shoulder, fit the word more perfectly than any he had eer seen."We have quite a selection," Mr. Engilwald began,gesturing with his wrinkled hands to the shelves around them, each filled with floating orbs of varying sizes, "Is there anything in particular that you are searching for?""Oh yes,"  Said the child, his eyes glinting, "I'm definitely looking for an unstable one, one I can alter.I want to see how they react to that.At least one ice age in it's history, and don't lie to me, I'll check the VIN on Planetfacts.""They react?What do you mean by they react?"His expression was puzzled, and rightly so.Most of his clients requested planets to host their own kingdoms, or use as personal getaways.Some, those of a more business nature, would open attractions or expansions.But none were quite like the child before him,  whose smirk seemed to drip onto the table like oil."Of course, the population!I want to host at least ten billion at maximum capacity.Really get the gears turning on this one, you know?And yes, here is a full list of the attributes that I am seeking.I won't have any less."He passed a piece of paper across the table, and Mr. Engilwald read, his eyes scanning the page."Abundant iron and copper, that will cost you dearly, boy.""Any age between prehistory and industrial bores me, and I'd rather accelerate them.Really get them hurtling into modern society faster than they can handle."Yawned the child, his arms crossed."And, what's this, uranium?!I can't just get that to *anyone*.""But you *can* give it to my father, who signed off on this expenditure.I want an abundance.Like, a ridiculous abundance.Something laughable.The planet should be damn near unstable."Mr. Engilwald frowned, and looked towards the child again, his expression concerned."You do realize I am morally obligated to ensure the proper care of child civilizations?""Of course, of course."Waved the boy, "But look, most civilizations don't make it past their infancy anyways, and I'll be sure to make it past that.Every year afterward is gravy, and it's far too interesting down the road.I want to see what happens when I *really* stir the pot."Behind him, the butler grimaced, but nodded.And Mr. Engilwald was reminded of old stories of when children would burn ants with lenses, or chase cats with sticks."We do have one in stock,"  He sighed, and rose, picking up the floating orb of a mass of green and blue, "But I'll be checking on you, boy.Don't give me reason to confiscate this.""I'm sure you'll find any trouble will be their own actions,"  He said, grinning, "In addition, I'll take the meteoric package, buried bones included.And I'll take it baked after a few millenia- can I bring it in the shop for a few thousand years acceleration?""For a small surcharge, absolutely,"  Mr. Engilwald sighed."Good.They're going to be confused as all hell when they find out their ancestors had all the same stories.Time to set about finishing my scripts then!"The boy raised a few sheets of paper, and beckoned at the door, calling in a host of other people.A short, pudgy man with dark hair, another with bright orange hair, and a woman who looked as if the skin stretched too tight across her face.And there were more, dozens more, each with their own costume and nationality, each from different ages of civilizations.Each with their own purpose in the boy's mind, with lines written by the careful hand of a fourteen year old."What a wonderful stage this will be, when the setting's complete and my actors are deployed,"  He said with glee, rubbing his hands together and reaching out to take the keys to the planet, the coordinates engraved on the metal, "What wonderful pets for me to play with, as the best birthday present ever."
