The day was turning to evening Thomas observed when he glanced through the window.He turned back towards the computer screen and stared at it with bleary eyes.Thomas had been running his family lumber mill ever since his father had passed away many years ago, may he rest in peace.He wondered briefly what number his dad would've gotten if he had been around for the Reveal.He didn't reckon that the late belt nights would've earned him any extra points.His mind wandered away to how the world had changed after the Reveal.It was a testament to the shallowness of mankind, with self-help books with titles "How I went from nine digits to four", reality show like "America's next top dad", and all these smug TV personalities that had gone from being ordinary people to being self-proclaimed gurus.Many of these "gurus" wouldn't dare to touch a mug today though.They might have been great guys back in the day, but their rankings had corrupted them.There was one instance with the narcissistic Donny Drumpf who claimed he was number one, and was gonna prove what a tremendous dad he was by grabbing a mug on live tv.The guy reckoned that if he created his own mug it wouldn't change the number.Brilliant, except that he underestimated the power of the mug gods (Yes, since no one knows how it all happened, we now have people worshipping the mug gods, or rather "The Almughty"), and instead he showed the world what a total mughole he was.It even resulted in investigations to the current world population, as the ranking had been such a high number.There had been a lot of speculation on who was #1.According to North Korea it was Kim Jong Un, no surprise there.That was only one of a dozen claims.Thomas let his eyes wander to his own mug.It was a classic #1 Dad mug, with the addition of a child's writing that said "Forever the best dad, Sara".The rating on the cup said #1.Thomas smiled.He turned off his computer, packed his stuff, locked up the office and headed to his car.He drove to the town's florist to get Sara som lilies.She had always loved them.Once he had paid for them, he got back into the car and drove to a small park.He entered the park and sat down on his knees."Hey honey, sorry for being late, hectic day at work today" he said as he organised the lilies on the ground.Opposite him was a tombstone.It read:

"In loving memory of Sara, our #1 girl".
