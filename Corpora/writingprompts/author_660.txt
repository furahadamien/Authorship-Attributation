Hi,.I'm Bob.I'm not a complicated man.I live in old Town.It's the edge of the world as far as the kids are concerned, but I enjoy it here.You see, old Town is where all the lost generation like me ended up after everyone we knew passed on.The house are small and the cars aren't flashy.My daughter comes and visits occasionally, as pretty as she was when she turned 25.25 years old, that's the age when you take 1 pill that will keep you from aging a day older.Of course it's really one pill a week but that's not what the enfinite ads tell you.I was to old when the pill came out, and it turns out I was lucky for it.I remember the day clearly, January 24th 2103.We were all sitting down at Dot's internet cafe when a notice popped up on our Twitterbook apps.World president declares failure to pay back fees due enfinite punishable by incarceration.The end of the free world.You see nobody would give an ager like me a 1000 year loan.I'll never own my own skyscraper.But kids 2 years younger than me got that.Hell I heard some people were getting 10000 year loans.And if course every year the rates go up, and the drug prices go up, pretty much everything went up.And if you fall to pay, you go to jail.Well really a forced work camp to pay your debts.And of course the cost of the mandatory enfinite pills gets added to your bill, faster than you pay it off I might add.If your lucky you might end up working in the house of one of the true Masters.No that's not for me.The reddits are saying that in 5 years almost 1/5th of the world will be enslaved.But me, I'm just scared for my daughter.Hopefully when I pass, my stash of garlicoins will be enough to last her for at least a thousand years.I was bitter for a long time, buy that day I saw that I was truly lucky and my relativity short life was spent doing what what mattered most to me.
