[WP] In the canine world, humans are celestial beings who live for more than 500years at a time.The caretaker of you and the past seven generations of your family will soon die.As usual, I woke up at 7am in the morning to wake up my master.I ran down the hallway energetically to his room, and call out to master."Master!Master!Rise and shine!"However, that day was different...

Master did not wake up immediately as usual, I continue to call him, but to no avail, it seems that my calls were not heard.He laid there sleeping soundly.I went up to him and licked him in the face, and only then he opened his eyes slowly.Master spoke weakly instead of his usual tone, " Good morning, Junior.." His voice was so faint, even my super sensitive ears could only barely hear him."Master what's wrong?"I asked him.He replied "I'm not feeling well today, let me rest a little more..".He went back to sleep while I went downstairs to meet my Julie, master's wife to have some breakfast.She was almost done with watering her plants when I got down.I called out to her good morning.She gave me a pat on the head and went on to prepare my breakfast.Her face wasn't filled with the usual bright smile which greeted me every morning, it was slightly gloomy.I went in the house ate my hearty breakfast.By that time only did master descended from his room.He was frail and weak today.He saw me, and gave me a good scratch under my chin.I always love it when he does that!He ate his breakfast with Julie, asking her about her plans for the "future".I stroll to the living room and wait for master to play with me, preparing my favourite ball toy and positioning myself in front of his favourite chair.Breakfast took a while, and master stumbled slowly to his favourite and laid in it comfortably.I pounced to signal to him to play with me.Instead of throwing my toy, master carried me.He whispered as he caressed my face "Junior, you look just like your father and his father and the rest of the seven generations, handsome and a fine looking hound.".He continued even softly" I've got a request, take care of Julie for me when I'm gone."I looked at him in puzzlement.He continue to stroke me gently, each stroke more gentle and faint than the previous.He smiled at me and soon closed his eyes.I licked master, but he didn't wake up.I barked loudly, yet his body never respond.I looked over at Julie for affirmation and she went over to carry me.As she was carrying me I saw tears rolling down her cheeks.She whimpered and spoke in a shaky manner " Let John(master) rest, we will go visit Jack and Jill to tell them about the news.."
