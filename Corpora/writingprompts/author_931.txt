It wasn't until the Nobel that it hit her.She had done it.Decades of work, of running in circles, of almost giving up, it all came to that point.And it was all worth it.Death had been cured.She was the first in a long list of immortals, the pioneer of a new era in history.Weeks after all the work, the announcements, and the celebrations, the dust had finally settled down a little, immortality was being diatributed to all, and she had the opportunity to relax.She had all the time in the world now, after all...Smiling, she looked at the pictures.Her own face, in middle of the hanging portraits of all tireless sciencists that had come before her, and the group of genious she had the honor to work with.It wouldn't have been possible without them, but it also wouldn't have been possible without...It.-You must be so much happy, so proud of yourself.You did it, you beated death.-The voice she had wanted to forget all her life had come back.She wasn't afraid.Not this time.It couldn't do anything to her.She turned around, to see an elegantly dressed figure sitting on her table, slim and tall, with no skin, and weird protuberances where they shouldn't been.Just as unnerving as she remembered.-What happened?Won't you at least welcome an old friend?-All her instincts screamed to run away, to get far and to hide from that thing.But she was stronger than that, she was now stronger than anything.She looked It straight to the face, to be greeted by a pair of sharp, glowing eyes, and a sad, almost nostalgic grin.-What do you want?I did not call you.-I came to greet you, of course.-It chuckled- Not every day someone kicks me out of my job, after all.By the way, what happened to your old coffee maker?-I dumped it when I got a new one.Now tell me what do you want or go away.-Don't you understand?What I want is to people to die.It is my purpose, the entire reason I even exist.And that won't be happening again.Never.I no longer have a meaning.The souls in hell will eventually burn out and become numb to all, but I will still be there.Waiting for something that won't come again.-Why are you here then?-Simple.You owe me.You owe me an eternity of suffering.-He stood up - And I will get it from you.Dead or alive.Months later, there was a funeral.
