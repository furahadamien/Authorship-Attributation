"Turn around, did I find you?"I turned around so I could see the voice that had haunted me for my entire life and see a girl, a very young girl, to young.I immediately turned back around and start walking away but she grabbed me.I spun and watch in horror as the small girl screams out in pain and starts melting.I try to help, cal her down, but at soon as I touch her, she is gone.I stared for a minute and walk away as if it hadn't happened.I assumed I was imagining it, I mean, nobody else saw it or seemed worried about it, than strange, and also sympathetic looks.Sympathetic?Why?I didn't know, nor care and just started walking away.A few days later, I was in my room and I heard the same thing turned around and saw a different girl, around the same age.Again I started to walk away and again she grabbed me, but this time, I didn't stick around to watch her melt away.But I heard her scream.This happened time after time, and there seemed to be no pattern other than the girl starting to melt the second we came into contact with them.I started to resent that voice, and that phrase.But time and time again I turned around.Then, one day, ignored the girl.I just kept on my way.Then the girl ran in front of me.She was older than the rest.Pretty much as old as I was.She reached out to me and said "I know its you, just acknowledge me!I heard you say not again just please!"I rushed back and screamed "NO DON'T, I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT"

She looked at me confused for a second.Then screamed.At first I thought it was going to end like the rest of the girls.But people where starring now, they acknowledged her existence.Then everything went black.I woke up in a strange place.Everything was white.I stood up and saw all the girls, everyone I had seen after hearing "Turn around, did I find you?"Even the older woman.We were all dead.All died in school shooting.All the girls were my students and the woman my wife.It was heart breaking realizing what had happened and getting my memories back.But at least none of the girls are alone here.But it seemed that it was only us here, no one else was in sight.I reconnected with my wife and the children played in the white stuff we where standing in.It was like sand, but it didn't feel like sand.It felt like...I don't know...

We then heard a voice.It said that we al were going back, to have new lives and they hoped we didn't see each other again for a long time.Then everything was white and cold.I started crying as the cold air rushed onto my naked body.Then there was a warm sensation and I was being rocked.I still felt off, nothing was right.My memories were slowly disappearing.Then, all I could think about was now.Now I wanted to sleep.So I started to fall asleep.The rocking was comforting and a woman started singing a sweet and relaxing tune.I fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.
