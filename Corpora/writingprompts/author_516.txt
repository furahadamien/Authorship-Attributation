James was not a great man.Great men walked up to the world and bent it to its will.Great men looked at challenge and laughed.James did his 9-5, came home, and sat down.He typically would stand back up a few times, to use the toilet or get a beer, but no more than a few.His son had stopped asking him to play with him a long time ago, not that James really noticed.It just, stopped, nothing to it.But then there was this mug.It was a gift for Christmas one year, a typical 8 year old present, a #1 Dad mug.But now it said he was #986,800,672.He looked out the window to the backyard, seeing his son toss a ball in the air and catch it.He looked back at the mug, then at his son....

James stood up.Perhaps he could play catch today.And the mug, now facing down, ticked down to #986,800,671.
