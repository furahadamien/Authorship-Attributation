You see every detail of your life being displayed as nothing but meaningless data.This enrages you.Each and every decision that you took some with serious consideration and others in haste are lying before you lifeless on paper.You can see every possible outcome of the decisions you should have taken but didn't.You see the outcome of eating right starting at age 7, 10, 20... You see what would have happened if instead of doing a Masters degree you would have continued in your old job complaining for the rest of your life.You see the outcome of marrying the person "that got away".You see the possibility of not having your first kiss till you're 21 and also what if you experienced all that and more at the age of 15 itself.You see how different your life would have been had you taken the risk and quit your job.You see the difference in your children's upbringing if you had taken that offer and moved to a different country.You see every possible different outcome you could have had as you flip through the pages towards the end.As you reach the end, you see that all the possible outcomes lead to this very moment in time.Here you are given the option to go back to your life as a baby with all this knowledge and live it out differently.Only one condition entailed: You cannot tell about this to anyone even if you tried.If you choose not to go down that road, you become one of the souls there guiding the newly dead people through this same experience.
