they just sat around saying nothing.so did I, I suppose.there is no one living to listen to us.Our bile is spewn forth with the gusto of an asthmatic spewing phlegm.We cling to life as if it is our breath.its funny some old Greek man at least i think hes Greek thinks breath is life.I suppose it is our life.for if you do not breath my name I am gone and forsaken.Yet I know there is something else.we may continue to debate and argue and earth?it continues to spin.the essence of life is  thought.The process of finding a solution.its what we have all done.its what THEY will continue to do.I myself I will find a new way of thinking.I believe this purgatory only exists for those who will not listen, those who think our cause doomed.we are more than the death of thought.we are those who think.
