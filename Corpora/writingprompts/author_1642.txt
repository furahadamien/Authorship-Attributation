The wind cracked and howled as it whipped about the smooth clearing.Skies of a deep blue-grey loomed in the distance, contrasting sharply with the bright green and dark greys of the grass and stones.All around the clearing, the world fell off, except to the north and south, where massive, moss and grass-painted mountain peaks rose into the whirling grey skies.Within the clearing itself, rounded huts of mortarless grey stone faced inward from the perimeter.The hundreds of stones were fitted together neatly, each stone resting on another, so that the whole structure held itself in place with no fastenings.Raghare stood outside one of the huts, alone in the howling wind heralding the coming of a mighty highland storm.His deep brown cloak of bear-fur fluttered and whipped at the edges, keeping him dry from the light sprinkling that had taken to the air.He breathed in heavily, taking in the cold freshness of the damp air, the scent of metal and earth and thunder.None of the other had awoken yet.It was not the dwarf way to wake before the sun hits its zenith.Reghare thought back to the stories of his youth, that told that the Earth-mother was jealous of her children, and ordered them only to walk the face of the Earth when the Sun-father was walking away and wouldnt see them.He smiled.Those stories had always made so much sense to him.Until now, he had not seen the strangeness of it all.He had been awake since a little after the sun took to the sky.The sharpness of the damp wind had brought him to life out of his sleep, and to what life it had brought him.While his warriors slept, the Redwood King had awoken to a world of strange clarity.A world that seemed to call him to memories of his childhood with every sound and scent and sight.At first he had thought himself dreaming, but he had come to see that he was not.He was very much awake.He had taken to his post outside the Auldhouse and drifted to thought of the coming day.Perhaps his clarity was a blessing from Frig, for his sacrifice.He had, the night before, not taken any of the ale, and left his portion to his warriors.It was in times of danger and strife that a kings metal* is truly tested, and Raghare meant to test well.A boom of thunder rolled across the horizon, carrying the trumpet call of Zoruthanes lightning across the highlands.With it, the Uiace began.Groans rumbled from within the ancient stonework auldhouses, and dwarfs of every race and creed began to tumble out from behind the curtains in the doorways.Some held their heads, while others found private places to pay Grundirs Price, hunched over and heaving from the ale and whiskey.Raghare watched with fascination.He had never seen a Uiace from without.Not since he was a child, that is.It was a miserable sight.The pain was palpable.From within the auldhouse beside him, his own warriors moaned and tumbled about, muttering for water, or curses on Grundirs greed, though these were always retracted with a muttering of thanks immediately afterward.A hand, clad in the leather-coated mail of the Kigoak dwarves, pushed aside the curtain and braced itself against the stones of the doorway.The wetted slabs maintained their grip in the rain from their rough-hewn, sharp edges, and the dwarf within propelled himself out into the sharp wind and drizzle, under a sky ever darkening to a deep grey.He paid the price, and looked up into the Uiace, eyes squinted and red.He turned to his king, stoic and steady in the twisting currents of air, only his bear-fur cloak moved by the sharp flurries, and stumbled to his feet.Ahhhh...pfft, he spit.Youre.are you well, chieftain? The umber-bearded dwarf stumbled a little, but caught himself before he totally tumbled over.I am spectacular, Addu! Raghare boomed, and laughed aloud.Groans came from the surrounding dwarves like a tuning orchestra.Ah, right, chief. Addu covered his head with his hands and grimaced, Ill get the water started, then. He stumbled off in the direction of the mountain springs on the edge of the cliffs.Raghare heaved his mighty Daneaxe onto his shoulder, and began to walk around the clearing.More and more dwarves began to make their way out of the auldhouses.A particular tribe had chosen a house each, as was the ancient tradition in grand moots.These same auldhouses had been used by kings and high chieftains of all dwarf kind for generations, gathering in times of great peril to dwarf-kind.In most cases, the leaders grumble and bicker for hours, until they break for dinner and return drunker, happier, and able to settle a deal.The next day is always spent ratifying the details, which results in the most bitter of arguments, and at times brawls, as most of the leaders have no recollection of much of the proceedings of the previous night.Votes are cast by the council at large, and whether or not the deal was actually made the night before, or if it was not and the claimant is mistaken, is determined by the moot as a whole.Once a working treaty is found, the leaders again break for dinner, and return to sign the treaty into law blessed by Grundir.This time was different, however.Grumpy, irritable dwarves gulped huge swigs of spring-water, washing down lard and bread, the traditional dwarf Uiace meal.They were quieter than usual.The endless wars that each of the tribes had faced from enemies on all sides had left the dwarvish peoples desperate, hungry, and exhausted.Ale stores had run dangerously low, and the ancient rites and rituals of Raghares people seemed doomed to go unperformed for the first time in known history.Perhaps it was in his time of greatest need that Frigg had chosen to bless Raghare.Perhaps this moot was of great significance even to the gods themselves.Raghare returned to his auldhouse, where he greeted his warriors.They prepared for the council meeting, where the very future of dwarfkind might be determined.There was only one more night's worth of ale on the mountain, and all the warriors and kings knew it.Tensions were high.Dwarves are irritable enough as is, but with no promise of the solace of Grundirs Gift, most dwarves were already well beyond the point of reason.Raghare helped his warriors pack their gear, clean the auldhouse, perform the rites and rituals of Frig and Zoruthane, and to their own god, Ordor the Bear-king.An hour or more passed, and the camp grew quiet with expectation and tension.A metallic booming from outside the auldhouse rang across the clearing.Raghare picked up his mighty axe and hoisted it on his shoulder.*it's an intentional misspelling.Dwarves believe their blood to be infused with metal, and to "test their metal" is to prove their dwarfishness.
