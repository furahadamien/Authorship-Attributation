I stood there flipping though the pages,

Across the room, the demon rages.&nbsp;

Howd you summon me!?

He screams with rage.I dont know!

I flip the page.&nbsp;

Two quarts stock,

A pile of carrots.I just dont know!

I asseverate.&nbsp;

The room grows red,

The shadows black,

What ingredient,

Did I lack?&nbsp;

A pinch of garlic!

I thought out loud.The demon belched,

And then he growled.&nbsp;

You forgot the garlic?

Came the shout.Whatd you use?

&nbsp;

I stopped.I shrugged.&nbsp;

Brussel sprout.
