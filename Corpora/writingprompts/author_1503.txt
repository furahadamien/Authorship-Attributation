I lost my arm in Afghanistan while serving.I steel feel like it's there, even though it isn't.I can...curl my "hand" into a fist.It's strange.I kept thinking that it's just normal.I'm an amputee, and I feel it.It's a nornal thing...or, it was, until last week.I found out that I can punch the ghosts I see.I thought that they were another symptom, along with everyone else.I can literally fight my inner demons.I can fight the ghosts of the soldiers that still haunt me.They try to fight back, but I just grab them and put them to the ground.They don't know that they're dead, so they don't stand up and leave.I beat them to death.They lay there, bleesing ectoplasm and then they fade away.I've been battling them for years.Who am I?I'm Sergeant Daniel Fenton.
