Ellashandra, High Priestess of Cinthrall, looked at the d20 in front of her."Seriously?Another 1?Are you *sure* you didn't curse my dice?"She asked petulantly of the floating skull across the table from her.Xenxar the Barbaraian snorted at her misfortune."Of course they aren't cursed I keep rolling 20s.And I've been using the same dice,  I'll have my own back as soon as I boil them clean again.""Do I want to know whose brains your cleaning off your dice bad this time?"Asked Ellashandra.Xenxar blushed and began to stammer "H-hey, it's not my fault.Draskic enchanted my dice to glow an evil red, so I wear them around my neck in battle to intimidate my enemies!They can't help but get a little messy from time to time.I mean they are kind of at brain splatter height after all."Ellashandra replied pointedly."Yes, we all know, that why I'm asking him if he enchanted *my* dice too!"She then shot him a dark glare full of promise.Draskic, the floating skull across the table, grinned at them both.Because, of course, he was a skull, and there aren't many other expressions a skull can show."Perhaps your God is influencing your rolls Ell.He *is* the god of domination after all.He's probably just showing you who's boss."Ellashandra replied sharply."That's not how that works!You don't understand the true meaning of--"

"Both of you be hush, or we are never going to finish this campaign!"Interrupted the green skinned Hrequarl from the last side if the table."I've got a lot more planned if we can get to it tonight.You rolled a 1 on your group charisma check with the other soccer moms.That means you forgot to even bring treats at all.The children are all utterly decimated.They go home hungry, thirsty, and angry.The other soccer moms shun you entirely for the next month.You get home to your husband.Sad and dejected.He asks you--"

"Devastated"  interjected Xenxar."What?"Asked Hrequarl."Decimated means to destroy one in ten.The world you're looking for is devastated, not decimated."Replied Xenxar."Oh shut up Xen" said Elle angrily."I'm getting really tired of this lame game.It makes no sense at all!How do you expect me to suspend disbelief when these rediculous situations keep being presented.First the children are in a battle, over a stupid ball of all things.Next, the worst injury any of them sustain is some grass stains on their knees.And instead of praising whatever god they worship that nobody died, they instead expect me to feed their own horrible offspring?My character doesn't even *like* any if them.Why in Cinthrall's dark name would I feed their damned kids?They can feed their own kids!"Hrequarl started to reply."But that's not--"

Ellashandra cut him off sharply.  "But that's not the worst of it, no.Last week we did that *church* campaign and you expected me to accept that most of the people there weren't after power.None of them even sacrificed so much as a rodent, and they were mostly there just to keep their parents and kids from judging them.The only part that made the tiniest but of sense was all the snide comments they kept making to each other as they self-righteously judged each other for every little thing."Draskic replied first."You're just upset that you've had a bit of bad luck Ella.The whole point is escapism into a different world where the rules are all different.It's fun once you start rolling better!"Hrequarl sighed and said "look, if you want to stop for tonight we can.I'll try to modify the *Soccer Season* campaign to make it more believable to you."Ellashandra sniffed and replied."See that you do!Come Xen, I need to get some things out of my system."She grabbed her whip and pulled on her thigh high black boots.Xenxar looked at the rest, let out a big grin and replied."You don't need to ask me twice!"As they got up to leave, neither one noticed Draskic softly chant another curse, renewing his spell on Ellashandra's dice."You know one if these nights, Ella is going to start casting dispel in those and then what are you going to do?"Said Hrequarl."I don't think so.She just got the black and pink glow perfect on them.She'd have to start over customizing them."Laughed Draskic."Besides, once she gets jealous enough of Xen, perhaps she will dump him.Then I'll have my chance with her."Hrequarl snorted derisively."You're a floating skull.I've probably got a better chance with her than you do!""Don't judge!The ways of necromancy are dark and mysterious."Said Draskic.
