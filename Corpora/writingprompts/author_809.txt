There are many people down here, you know.Many, misunderstood people that is.At least, that's what I've been told.You see, I've only been down here for, what I believe to be, a few days.I have, surprisingly, made a few friends already.This "Hell" I have heard preaches about and read books about is nothing like it really is.In fact, I have yet to see one demon, or torturer, or monster, or even the Devil himself.I was kind of just thrown down here.Also, it's pretty cool that I am allowed to keep a journal down here.I mean,of course this place isn't great by any stretch of the imagination.The place is just a few degrees too warm.Just warm enough to make you complain and feel uncomfortable but not enough to hurt you.The main problem here  is there isn't much to do.Bundy told me that there is going to be a meeting today as to what the humans will do next, whatever the hell that means.I guess I am going to go because I literally have nothing else to do.I will write back about what happens.Obviously, it's going to suck to be here for the rest of eternity, but I think i can make it work.Okay so, jeez, a lot of crazy shit just went down.There are a lot more people down here than I thought.Bundy got me through to the front of the gathering, so I could see what was happening, but God I did not expect this.Hitler,

Like THE Hitler is here.I mean obviously he was an awful person and all but wow!He is here and he has quite the following.Let me start from the beginning.Pretty much, this is how it went down.The biggest crowd I've ever seen in my life, and afterlife, crowded around the center of Hell, which, by the way, is just a large crater with pockets of reddish tar, and waited.We waited for what must have been at least 2 days.Then, all of a sudden, a trumpet played.It was just one loud, shrill sound that pierced the noise of the congregation.The sea of people split in two and left a massive opening for something huge to pass through.Next came the most insane display of power that I had ever seen.Hitler and some other people, who I definitely should have known from my high school social studies classes, were riding on what appeared to be a thick black cage.As the caravan got closer I could make out a massive red figure- with horns and fangs contained within the cage.If this is the devil, I thought to myself, then that is the most stereotypical devil he could possibly be.The caravan got to the center of the mass of Us and everyone kneeled.A speaker produced a deafening squeak then a "Hello?"came from it."Hello is this on?"said an agitated voice that sounded slightly German.Someone below, who I could only assume was Hitler, gave him a thumbs up."As you know," he said "I am Hitler."An unenthusiastic "Heil Hitler" was murmured through the crowd."And this here is the Devil Himself!"Now the crowd roared."This meeting scheduled today is to discuss how we are going to get out of here!"Okay a lot more happened but I just got a call from Bundy- I have been invited to a personal feast with Hitler himself!Wish me luck.I will write soon.
