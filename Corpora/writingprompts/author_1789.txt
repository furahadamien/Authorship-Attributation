I looked up, dumbfounded, struggling to say something.I felt so many things at one time.Emotions washed over me the same as they had throughout the ten years he was absent, but this time all at once.I stuttered and briefly questioned reality.He looked the same as he did the day he left; a worn out car salesman in a thrift corduroy brown suit accessorized with a leather briefcase grandpa gifted him.It was clearly out of place.He paid little attention to self care, and it reflected in almost everything he was.He lived somewhere in between making his own choices and leaving them up to something else.It was as if he was in some sort of denial about his reality, and he was waiting for something great to save him.Occasionally he displayed charged acts of self control, determination and ambition.He paid attention to my life in brief fleeting segments.They were always short lived.I can recall the details of that night because I replayed them so many times over.I could still smell the alcohol on him.There was the familiar warm musk cologned over the type of sweat that only stunk of something stale and stagnant.But oddly, I missed that smell.Relief washed over as the salty sea air carried his musk in as the door opened casually.He appeared to pay no mind to his absence.My tears rolled meeting my lips.Dad was home, but where had he been all these years?Why did he look mostly the same?One important detail caught my eye.Something unfamiliar.A black stone.He held it in his hands as his shoes brought in a fine white powder that dirtied our floors.His eyes sparkled.
