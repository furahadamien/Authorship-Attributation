Bobby took one look around him and a thousand versions of him stared back at him smiling.Er, well, at least he thought they looked a lot like him.Some had long hair.Some had glasses.Some wore suits from the Mad Men era it seemed.Some wore farmers clothing, others wore doctors coats.They were all the things that Bobby had ever dreamed of, and they were standing right there.A sign above him said, Hall B and someone shouted, Welcome to the Hall of Bobby!And a loud applause broke out.Standing next to him was a man wearing a beret.He had a feeling that the natural tendencies that he had for art somehow were connected to him.He, himself, he had been a writer.Writing like his life depended on it.Writing all the way up until the night of the... he paused... the accident.It was all starting to come back.He had been at the newspaper office very late writing a piece for the front page.It was about 3am when he got into his car and a big giant post came out of nowhere.And then blam, he ended up here.The man in the beret said, We really enjoyed the pieces you wrote.You really should have chosen Carol though over your work.I think you would have lived a happier life!

Yes!You definitely would have, said a man 4 chairs down.He seemed to be dressed like a drummer in a band.An usher came by.He had wings on his back and he was dressed in white, and said, Heres your seat here sir, pointing to the open seat next to the beret wearing man.The movie will be starting soon, please take your seat...

But... what is this place? Bobby asked.Oh, well, this is the Hall of Bobby, said the usher, this is where all versions of you , all past reincarnations, all previous lives youve lived, come to after death.

He went on, directing his attention upwards to the ceiling, revealing 3 or 4 more balconies of people, all who looked like him, just at various stages of age and even ethnicity.They come here to this theater to watch the adventures of your next life.Its more of a holding place until you get to the next stage.

Oh, wow, does it ever end?, exclaimed Bobby, When do we all get to leave this holding place?It seems like some of these guys have watched hundreds of movies.What are they all waiting for?

The usher smiled and simply said, For you to live the life God had intended.For you to live the life that fulfills your maximum potential!When you find why you were created and who you are, then the doors up there will open.

Bobby squinted really hard at the tiny letters above the door which read, Stairway to Heaven!

Until then, the usher continued, sit back, relax, and enjoy the show!

Damn it!Why can I never get this right?! Said Stu.He knew that this girl was the one for him.The moment he had set eyes on her while watching that concert over 5 years ago, he knew she was the one.He just felt it.From her slender body to the way her hair fell on her shoulders.He had googled her right after the concert finished and he fell more in love with her ever since.Being a shapeshifter and all, he decided to make himself into a musician.At first he made himself into the lead musician in her quartet, but he obviously didnt think that one through very well.Things started out great in the beginning because he would just walk in and everyone would recognize him.Even she would start making googly eyes at him.He thought he had hit the home run.But unfortunately, during the first practice, he totally botched up the entire piece, and he could only feign being sick for so long!So, even though he had knocked out the original guy, he had to revive him and bring him back so that he could play the piece.Of course he lost the girl for a little while because, well, she fell in love with the real guy, but she couldnt understand why his mood was so drastically different than before and they eventually broke up.Next, he tried to be her sisters best friend who was a guy, and he tried to find out from the sister what her type was!It was a little strange at first, because he didnt know that the sister was into her best friend, so he ended up going out with the sister for a while but he knew that she wasnt the one for him even though it was actually a really good relationship!He finally broke it off, and then went and shapeshifter into the perfect guy for his first love.Though it was a little like Deja Vu because things started out great!She seemed really into him, but then before he could ask her out on a date, she ended up blowing him off and not showing up to dinner one night.He couldnt understand it.So he tried a different approach.Lets just cut it short here and jump ahead and save you the sob stories.To sum it up , hes tried it 32 times.Who knew that a girl could date that many times?!Each of the subsequent recent times had been shorter and shorter, with her saying, I dont know why, but it seems like I just went through this!

Maybe she was catching on and maybe he should have given up.But he was determined to try one last time.He finally found her journal and discovered that she had a picture of what she considered her soul mate though it looked like the picture was pasted backward so he couldnt actually see the photo.But luckily all he had to do was just touch the back of the photo and he could shapeshift into the person on that photo.So after stealing her journal in the green room at the back of the concert hall, he snuck into a closet, opened the book and touched the photo and then emerged.He felt a little funny and he walked a little strangely, but when he came out of the closet, his chest was a little bigger and he was missing a piece of equipment down in the nether regions.He paused in front of a mirror and knew why she had never been into him.Staring back at him, was the figure of a girl.

Winter fell upon the city and chilled Jack to the bone.It was the bones that gave people away.A few years back, after the great famines of 2052, we were all tagged on our right arm subcutaneously almost directly on the bone with a chemical compound that reacted with the age of your body.In essence, it started tracking how old you were and whether you needed food.For a while, only specially designed machines could tell how old a person was and then dispense the right food rations for your age, height, and weight.But a few years after that, certain people found that they would start to see a small number appear floating above peoples heads.These people became bodyguards and bouncers because of course, it allowed them to tell the actual age of people.They werent too good with the ladies though because they could always tell how old they were and would know when they were lying, but that was the trade off.Jack had discovered that he had this power and joined the Elite Bouncer team of the United Nations.The EBUN as they called it.Not that they had great buns, but well, you get the idea.Things were going fine.People either had 1 or 2 digits above their head.But one day, out of the blue, a 4 digit number appeared above someones head.It was the start of winter and the global warming had actually gone the opposite of what everyone predicted, the tricks done back in the early 2040s to try to cool the planet backfired and turned it into a refrigerator.I guess puncturing a hole in the atmosphere to release the greenhouse gases let the vacuum of space suck ALL the heat away, leaving a bone chilling biting cold that nipped away any body warmth you had left.So people had developed these super thick coats they wore to travel from place to place when you stepped outside.Modern medicine helped a little so occasionally you saw a 3 digit number.But a four digit number, that was impossible.Medicine hadnt progressed this far.But on this particular day, something was different.The moment he saw that 4 digit number, there was a warm feeling that started to come over him.That was the moment, as the stories would later tell, was the 2nd coming of Jesus Christ.

NOW!!!! I shouted at my teammate, Dr. Mandrake.We were both PhD students in time physics and mechanics at the University of Chronos, Virginia.The year was 2025, and we had been invited to the most prestigious university.Though, since we joined, it seems that collection of a bunch of time students together enhances all the abilities.So since the evening of the first day, basically after orientation, I, Dr. Patrick together with Dr. Mandrake, weve been stopping crime in the city as well as evil alien monsters from invading our planet.And thats exactly what we were doing tonight.There was a giant octopus monster terrorizing New York City.A lot of our friends were sent in to fight this giant monster but had fallen to the wayside.Other super heroes from around the world fought and died fighting.When we heard the news, we knew that we were the only two who could stop it.Thats because Dr. Mandrakes super power is to stop and freeze time.But strangely, and by some strange strike of destiny, on that fateful day in orientation.I discovered that when he demonstrated his power and we were all frozen.I was the only one who could continue to move.It was a strange realization.I mean, when I was little, I would notice time stopping.I had been searching ever since I was 8 during that first time freeze moment, for how I could stop time.But I soon discovered that that was not my power at all.It could only be used in conjunction with someone else who could stop time.That was the beauty.It made me depend on others.I couldnt be the independent loner that I was anymore, it showed me that I needed to lean on other people.So, back to the story.When I shouted NOW!!! It means that Dr. Mandrake froze time right when the giant octopus monster was about to open his mouth and eat me alive.And in that exact moment, I continued to move and injected the octopus with a shrinking serum in 246 places on his giant body.And when Dr. Mandrake unfroze time, and the octopus started to shrink, down, down, and down.All the way until we could stuff him into a glass jar and put the lid on.We poked holes in it of course so he could breath.And thats the story of how two PhD students saved the world.Now we just have to graduate college, but I dont think that matters as much now.We have much bigger fish to fry!The possibilities are endless.

An envelope.A single envelope.That was the indicator that I knew I was crazy.Or was I?All I had done was simply ask my mind a question.I always knew there was some strange separate voice inside my head.One that would get riled up whenever something good happened.One that would fill my subconscious with self-doubt and self-deprecation.Why did he always have to ruin such a good moment with his opinion, or his desire, or his lethargy?I was still living at home in my parents apartment with my two brothers.One older and one younger.It was one day that I decided to yell out loud to the darkness, in the cool still morning air of my bedroom.STOP!!!I will not allow you to stay in my head anymore!!This is it!If you want to stay, youll have to start paying rent if you want to live here.Otherwise you are no longer allowed in this house!This is a sanctuary and Im not allowing it to be defiled by the likes of you and your cruel silly jokes!You will pay for what youve done to my life!

And suddenly the voices in my head stopped.Silence.Such a beautiful gorgeous sound.The sound of nothingness.The tension in my body released.I was able to breath a full breath.The light started spilling in.I went about my day with a skip in my step and whats more, I even told my therapist about it and he gave me a high-five.I had only been diagnosed with schizophrenia 4 months ago and he said that I was making incredible progress ever since we started our sessions together.Week by week, I was supposed to send him updates.So that was my update yesterday.But today, an envelope appeared under my door.One single envelope with the word, RENT written in big bold sharpie on the front of it.Thats when I started to freak out.The voices started coming back.It was a cacophony in my head again.Maybe I really was crazy.Maybe I would never be able to break free from this.I was doomed to be trapped in this prison from which I could never escape.I called my therapist to tell him what had happened and he said to just breath and calm down and to bring the envelope into the office.I picked up the envelope and opened the door.As I walked down the stairs, I noticed something funny about the envelope, it was my brothers signature handwriting.Then saw my older brother staring at me at the bottom of the stairs.Hey, he said, Im sorry for all the things Ive done to you throughout your life, I hope this covers this months rent.
