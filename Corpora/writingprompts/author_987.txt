Time is a precious thing.It's what governs our lives, controls us.My mother always used to say that there were two things certain in life; death, and taxes.There is one thing we can never escape, one rule of physics that can seemingly never be broken.We cannot escape the end.Some people spend their time helping others, making the world a better place.Some live day to day, trying to put food on the table for their family.Yet some feel the need to rob others, taking everything in bank accounts, homes, safes.Ever since the scientists had figured out how to tie the time we had left on this earth to a clock, people had been looking to exploit the system.Stealing time from others.The way it worked was that you'd pay for things in time.Your bank account consisted of the same number of dollars as seconds on your clock, and when that reached zero, you'd wither away and die.I want to be able to say that I spent my time well, but in truth I did not.I wanted to spend more time with my family, spend every possible second with them until my demise.So when my bank account showed I had 24 hours left, I knew what I had to do.I was in the car on my way home when the bank called."Sir, I have to inform you someone has stolen $10 from you.Normally this would be inconsequential and I would not call - we would investigate and call only if we couldn't resolve it - but given the amount of money in your account, we thought this may impact your plans."*Fuck.*

There goes my plans for a grand celebration.I had to track this man down who stole my time."What do you know?""Not much.We think the culprit is a male, late teens, but beyond that our investigators are drawing blanks.We'll keep you updated."I drove home, but instead of going into the living room, I went into my study.I had some work to do.I wrote letters, made phone calls.I had to make sure that whoever this was, got punished.I called in favors, asked everyone I knew to make sure the system became impenetrable.Almost the entirety of my remaining 24 hours were spent fighting this.What happened to me could not happen again.Finally, I had to make a choice.My son was in hospital, so I chose to ring him.Sitting down in the living room with my wife, the phone connected;

"Dad?""Son, I just wanted you to know that I love you, with every fiber of my being.Don't ever forget that.""Dad, I know.And I have something to say.The doctors had a procedure to try.They told me it was risky, that my time was nearly up.They needed a little extra, ten seconds or so.I hope you don't mind."I don't think he knew.But those were the last words I heard, over the soft tears of my wife.--

I took inspiration for this from the movie *In Time*, but tried to make it different enough.Hope you guys enjoyed it :)
