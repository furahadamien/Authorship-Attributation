"Welp."he thought to himself, "It looks like they finally did it.It looks like this is it."&#x200B;

He stood on at the center of a manicured green field that stretched off into the distance, flanked by lines of concrete and marble.In the distance stood a single white obelisk, rising against the backdrop of an impossibly blue sky.The sun stood shining at the center of it's axis, illuminating the straight lines and curved arches that signified civilization.The sirens blared continued to blare, flirting across the still surface of his consciousness.Only the discipline instilled over eons of solitude enabled him to maintain his focus.&#x200B;

"I suppose this is the best He's ever done - and He's been at it a long time too.4 billion years, give or take a few dozen millennia.Not bad at all I suppose, better than His previous record by a fair amount."&#x200B;

He could almost feel the panic that had spread throughout every fiber of life on this world.He could almost feel the terror of impending doom that coursed through their minds like a river that had burst its banks.He could almost feel their disbelief and fear.Almost.&#x200B;

"It was too long ago now."He continued, "I am surrounded by the strongest emotions my kind will ever know, that pungent flavor of life triggered by the certainty that death comes for it and the impossibility of preventing or delaying its passage, and yet I feel nothing.No mirror of emotion lies buried in my soul.No sliver of fear pierces the tranquility of my mind.Has it truly been so long since I've passed through those gates myself?Have I forgotten what it is to feel?"&#x200B;

He cast his mind back, searching for that moment.The one he had revisited over and over and over again in his mind until it brought him nothingness.No pain, no regret, no anger or hostility, no desire for vengeance.Nothing except acceptance.He thought of his brother's knife and the justice of a god.The flash of pain, the passage into oblivion, and the blessing of his undertaking.A shepherd of sheep in one life and a shepherd of souls in the next.&#x200B;

"If nothing else, the Man's got a sense of irony.I'll give Him that.He knows how to tell a story."He mused to himself, "I was the first of my kind to die and will be the last to leave.The greatest exhibit of life's capacity for good becomes the nexus of it's destruction; even I have to admit there is a certain poetry to the conclusion of my kind.I was murdered by my brother's jealously, just as these states murder each other through fear of the other eclipsing their greatness."&#x200B;

The first of the lights erupted in the distance, marking the birth of an anti-sun on the surface of the planet.It grew, higher and brighter, until a wave of sound and air and annihilation swept through the reality that blanketed him.A symphony of destruction buffeted the world around him, obliterating the banners of red lines and white stars that had come to represent the pinnacle of civilization.&#x200B;

As the existence of a species transitioned into the death of all life on Earth, Abel stood on that field of green as it died  and directed the tide of souls up into their respective domains.Those that rose wept in joy, and those that fell wept in fear; but all of them wept for the necessary imperfections in life.&#x200B;

And as Abel continued his task, he felt the first hint of emotion flicker in his chest."Nervousness" 

&#x200B;

"I wonder what happens now."
