Periapoapsis
*Turn around, did I find you?*

I froze.*No.No No No.*

*Turn around.*

I begin to turn.People shuffle past in the milling crowd.I see her.She has brown eyes and black hair.She is wearing a red coat.She is wearing headphones.*Is that you?*

I nod at her.*Get the fuck out of my head* 

She reaches into her coat.I stare dumbly.She pulls out the pistol.I remain frozen.*You don't want to do that.*

She points it at me.I see her hands shaking.*I can't do this.*

She lifts the gun to her chin.*Bye.*

I rush forward.*Wait, stop!*

**Bang**

I catch her body as it falls, the crowd is screaming around me.*Finally, alone.*

Ultra Man watched his grapple soar up and over the roof of the abandoned warehouse.There was a satisfying clink, and in seconds he was speeding upwards.From his new vantage he looked out across the city and saw pulsating red and blue lights as the man hunt continued.*Probably for the best that it's just me*, he thought as he put his grappling gun back in it's holster and turned to see a skylight windows ahead of him."Bingpot."Stepping forward he looked down, and was greeted by all sorts of dastardly machinery, with blinking lights and hard to understand interfaces.He'd seen this equipment once before, the last time Electro had escaped his grasp.Strangely, there were no henchman operating the devices.Without thinking he stomped down onto the glass, and almost fell through ungracefully as the skylight shattered.He lowered himself carefully through the broken shards of glass, then deployed his trusty wings.Gliding down serenely he saw that the room was abandoned, seemingly in the middle of a party.*What could a man so sinister possibly have to party about?* Ultra Man landed next to a machine.Before he had more time to take in his surroundings, there was a pounding on a plain brown door he hadn't noticed before."Guys!Can you let me in?I think I left my keys."a voice said through the door.Ultra Man hesitated briefly, before walking silently to the door.He leaned into the peephole, only to see a brown haired man in jeans and a T-shirt smiling back at him.Ultra Man unlocked the door and rared back his right fist.It swung open immediately, and Ultra Man watched the man's eyes widen at his caped crusading image."Where's Electro?!"Ultra Man demanded."Uhm, ah uh- Electro?""Yes, your boss, were is he?""He... uh, he left.""Not likely.The cops are swarming this town, everyone in the city is on the lookout.""I think I saw him in the alley out back."the man said suddenly, as if remembering.Ultra man pushed him aside, and ran through the door to find himself in an alley all alone.After checking all of the dark corners, he walked calmly back into the door."You know, I was going to go easy you if you cooperated."he said.He froze in the middle of his entrance.There was a loud bang.He felt a strange warmth down his stomach, and looked down to see his black suit covered in crimson.Before he knew what was happening he was on his knees.The man from before stood holding a pistol off to his immediate right."I knew you'd come after me, Ultra Man, but I was hoping you wouldn't.You always had the most heart out of all you little heroes.I'm almost sorry to tell you it's over.Now that I've gone through with it, nobody needs you or I any more."he said, before raising the pistol to his temple and pulling the trigger.Ultra Man felt himself fade very slowly.___exists
