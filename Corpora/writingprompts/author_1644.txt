"So you're telling me," Flingrad pushed his ale to the side, though with full intention of finishing it, wiped the remnants of foam from his beard, and sat forward in the wooden chair to rest his arms on the cold, stone table, "You woke up today, and you felt no urge to vomit?""I'm telling you, nothing.I felt nothing at all."The dim light emanating from the tavern's hearth reflected in Klengrad's wild, wide eyes.It was an expression of wonder and fear Flingrad had never seen in his brother before."I stood from my furs and my woman, and I felt... good.Even great.""The world around you was not spinning.""No," Klengrad went on, "The meat and potatoes from last night stays in me.Flin, I could look at the sun and feel no pain, I made water and it had no odor, and what's more...I remember.I remember everything that happened last night.""Ah, horse-piles."Flingrad snatched his ale back up and his lips lunged for the clay mug."You don't believe me?"Flingrad belched and placed the clay mug back down on the table."I'll tell you what I believe.I believe you've gone Elf on us.Or you're going Elf, one of the two.Now, I'm blessed with mother's patience and I'm willing to wait out your little youthful mistake, and in the meantime," He reached for his brother's still-full mug, "I'll will be helping myself to your ale.""I told you I didn't want any.You're wasting your copper.""You will, Elf, you will."Flingrad brought the mug to his lips and began to drink.Klengrad smirked, "You may have mother's patience, but you've also got father's mind.It's beyond you to grasp new ideas or break tradition--"

Flingrad slammed the empty mug down, cracking the bottom on the table; foam trickled over his leather gloves and hairy knuckles.A few other patrons glanced over briefly to see what it was over which the sons of Triungrad were arguing."Now, listen, Elf."Flingrad pushed the bits of broken clay out of his way, and pointed his finger at his brother, "What you're doing is an embarrassment.To me, to our father.You think you're crossing into unmarked areas on the map.You think you're gonna try and change our ways with your persuasion?Not while I have a say in it.""Don't call me 'Elf' again.""No ale?No early sick?You keep your dinner the next morning like some babe?Next thing you know you'll be shaving your beard in different designs like a man, or maybe it'll fall off altogether.Maybe the sun will bake your hair into a golden color, and you'll be really happy about that, wouldn't you, Elf?"Klengrad stood fast, "I said DON'T BLOODY CALL ME THAT."only to be met by his brother.The two grasped a handful of the other's tunics, and pulled into each other.They stared with unblinking eyes for a few moments.Their jaws clenched and nostrils flared.Flingrad let go of his brother's tunic, and chuckled."I think the lack of ale has you thinking funny."He slapped Klengrad's chest, not with aggression, but neither in jest.He pushed himself from Klengrad's grip, grabbed his pack, and headed for the door."See you at the mine.Shift at four bells."Klengrad stood next to their table and watched his brother tip the bartender and apologize for the broken mug and the disruption.Klengrad knew that someone would understand what he had discovered, someone would listen and give him a chance, but he would have to be cautious of who he told.Many of their clan would take to the new way of thinking much like his brother, and he might face alienation if he kept it up for too long.His friends might not talk to him anymore.Shelana might leave him for another.Maybe it wasn't even worth it.Maybe there was no suppression of powers from the ale.Maybe he and his kind were meant to live the way they do, drinking from early ages and all hours of the day.Maybe they were not meant to be like elves and men, drinking for leisure.He thought of the conversation with his brother, and he felt shame.He felt humiliation.He nodded his head, "It is an embarrassment..."

He had another bell before he would have to head out toward the mine to be there in time for shift-change.He held a copper in his hand and fiddled with it, wondering if he should have just one ale for the road.
