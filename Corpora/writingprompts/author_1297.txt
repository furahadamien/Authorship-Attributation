At last, I had found it: the lost Library of Alexandria!Oh, how I had awaited this day!I had poured my lifeblood into this search, just as my father and his father before him had- but what a stroke of luck that the honor of discovering it should fall upon me!And as I rushed through the dry, dark tunnels, surrounded on both sides by marble shelves piled high with scrolls, I couldnt help but let out a squeal of excitement.Trying to calm myself, I quickly found a wide, sweeping marble table and sat down in a chair that was millenia old.Sobering up, I ever-so-gently drew a picture of my grandfather from my pocket and set it down on the table.This is for you, grandpa.You gave me the daring and courage to continue your quest, and thanks to my research Ive finally uncovered this font of knowledge!I couldnt have- I paused to wipe off the tears welling up in my eyes- I couldnt have done it without you.I know that youre still here, watching over me, and that youll be reading every one of these scrolls alongside of me.  
	I waited until I could stop the tears of bittersweet joy flowing down my cheeks, and then put on a pair of latex gloves and started off into the library.Remembering where I was, some of my previous vigor returned to me and I decided to grab a scroll at random to analyze.I brought it back to the table and, lying it down next to my grandfathers visage, gingerly unfolded it and began to read.Wait a second English?!?This scroll was written in English?!?I looked down at the rest of the long, unfolding papyrus in despair.Someone must have gotten here before me!I threw the scroll to the ground, face buried in my hands, once again weeping.How?How could somebody else have reached this place before I had?Three generations of hard study and commitment, only to be cruelly denied by fate!But something on the scroll caught my eye.Movement.I quickly grabbed the end of the scroll and brought it close to my face, reading the words now writing themselves upon the page.But something on the scroll caught his eye.Movement.He quickly grabbed the end of the scroll and brought it close to his face, reading the words now writing themselves upon the page.  I looked at this for a moment, gaping, and then grabbed the upper portion of the scroll from the floor and began to read a summary of my college years.Holy shit.It was my life story!But how?How was this possible?I pondered this for a moment, then decided to take a brief skim through my life story.I had somewhat fond memory of high school, despite not having many friends.The people who did make my acquaintance were other geology and archaeology enthusiasts, which there were a surprising amount of.I even discovered a list of my classmates, ranging all the way from Stephen Athaway to Andrea Wright.Andrea she was one of the classmates I remembered more than others.I hadnt really noticed her until junior year, when she suddenly developed a love for archaeology.Thank goodness.It had, at least, put a stop to her eccentric behavior for a little while.I looked through the book for her, and found a sentence or two saying exactly that.Then something occurred to me.Maybe I could find the root of her odd mannerisms!I quickly sifted through the scrolls adjacent to my own until I found one with her name embellished on it.I quickly began to read through it, eventually reading the high school section
	But it was then that I was struck dumb, for an entire section of her own parchment was about me.How she had loved me so deeply, but never knew how to express it.How she was shy and hesitant to proclaim her deep affection for me, and how my unpopularity my unpopularity?I read on.Hes so unempathetic at times, or so people say.I try to get him to notice me, even acknowledge my existence but hes so caught up in his grandfathers stories, he barely has time for the real world.For me.
	My gut sank.What I had thought to be strange behavior had been her trying to get my attention, to realize her profound and true love for me and maybe, just maybe, I would love her back.I felt like I would throw up.The girl I had shunned, ignored, turned my back to, had been my only admirer.But it was too late.I was too caught up in my work, my damned quest to find this place 
	I gulped.How that must have felt, to have devoted so much of your life to one person, only to have that person ignore you
	The walls drew in close to me, and my breath came out in shuddering gasps.I had to do something about this.About her.(One week Later)
	
Andrea heard the knock on her door as she finished tying the knot.She had waited for this day for a long time now, not out of anticipation or fear, but out of desperation.Hell come to me, she had thought.But every rational bone in her body told her that he wouldnt.The hammer and nails were prepared, the chair propped up in the middle of the living room, but she hesitated, and then, deciding her demise could wait for the mail, walked into the mudroom and opened the door.And he fell on her like a typhoon onto an island, a whirlwind of suppressed passion and unfound love.And just moments before she had taken her own life, she finally felt whole again.
