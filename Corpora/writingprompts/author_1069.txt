The red pill or the blue pill, the green line or the red.This simple dichotomy of good and bad was something our protagonist didn't believe in.Nothing is ever so black and white.Despite this idea, Peter had been following the green line for years, treading the path of least resistance and it had brought him success in many vanes of life, yet he was not fulfilled.Peter gazed out his window, a light wind rustled the long grass that covered the land surrounding the house.Peter had spent many happy years in the city with his perfect wife and his perfect life, but yet something was missing.Peter felt lost, his whole life he'd never made a decision for himself, whatever governed these lines did.He was tired, tired of never having to try, never having to work hard to achieve greatness.Was the green line so perfect?They say that hardship makes a man, perhaps then, peter wasn't a man.That night peter gathered his resolve and packed a small bag, in it he stowed his pistol, a torch, a pocketknife and firelighters.He stepped out his front door into the cool night air, it was a full moon, the grass pale in the moonlight moved as if alive, beckoning to him.In the dirt peter could see a red and green line, he set off along the red.For hours he walked the red line, until he came upon an outcrop of rock.The outcrop looked down into a deep valley, he could see two lights meandering through the valley, a car.He set off down into the valley, all the time following the line.After an hour, maybe two, he reached a clearing, he waited, Peter didn't know why but he had the urge to hide and wait.A few minutes later a car pulled into the clearing.The car slowed to a stop, the lights still on, a man shaped silhouette emerged from the drivers seat.He leaned against the bonnet and pulled a cigarette packet out of his pocket, he slid one out and into his mouth where he then lit it.Peter sat behind a tree and watched, all that time wondering why he had been brought here.After a time the man flicked the but away and walked to the boot, peter then lost sight of the man for what seemed like an eternity.Eventually the man emerged, dragging something Peter could not see.His heartbeat quickened, the man stopped and threw the shape, it moved frantically.It was now, Peter realised what he was witnessing, he had to move, to do something, but still he crouched frozen in fear.The man pulled a pistol slowly out his jeans and said something inaudible, his hand was steady, a few second passed.He had to do something, he drew his pistol out of his bag, it felt alien in his hand, he raised it with a shaking hand at the man who stood in the clearing.His finger tightened round the trigger, he heard the bang, saw the flash and saw the mans body slump to the ground.Shaking, peter stood, he crossed the clearing, pocket knife in hand and cut the rope tying the man.Then he turned on his heel and ran, he ran for what seemed like hours; finally he reached the house.His clammy hand tightened around the doorknob and he stepped into his home, quickly he climbed the steps and collapsed into bed.He lay there all night gazing at the ceiling, unable to sleep, finally the sun rose and with it so did peter.He walked down his stairs and onto the front porch, expecting a police car to be waiting outside, but it wasn't.Just the morning newspaper.He picked it up and stepped back through his door, he sat down at his kitchen table and looked down at the paper.On the cover a headline stood in bold and underneath it a story.A man had been found dead in the early hours of the morning, that same night another man had disappeared after being released from prison that same day.This unarmed  man had murdered a whole family in cold blood, aside from the father who'd been working that night.
