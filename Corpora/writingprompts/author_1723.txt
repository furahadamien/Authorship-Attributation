Lindsay drifted along an icy asteroid belt trying to remember the words to a song the Comms Major played for her last week.She pressed the uplink button on her space helmet and, seconds later, heard the familiar voice of the Comms Major come crackling in through the intercom."What can I do for you, Lynn?"said the Comms Major."Remember that tune you played for me last week?""Which?""That last one.With the flute coda.Who sings on that one?""Oh.Mrs. Susanne Bierman.Sounds kinda throaty.She graduated from the Grigiis Conservatory, on that funky disk."Yes, the Grigiis Conservatory, established on the edge of a whirring nebular disk by a sorcerer named Grigiis Nephelym, shaper of elements.The academy amassed a lofty reputation not only for its output of piping opera singers, but as an architectural and magical marvel.The school clings to the edge of the nebular disk by an exotic force of magic not entirely understood by anyone outside Nephelym's narrow network of collaborators, careening through the galaxy at unimaginable velocities.Bierman graduated from the academy to a career in jazz singing."Bierman."said Lindsay."How'd that song go?"Sang the Comms Major: "'If only I had a rock to hold me in place, to carry my rivers on its back, to fuel my flame and breathe, breathe into my heart.A rock to call my home.""Yes.I like that one.""It's a favorite of mine."They paused, each imagining the next few verses."Do you think we'll ever find one?""What?""An Earth.""No.We're in the not-Earth universe.Remember?""Oh, right."Lindsay said."We got the magic, water, air, and fire universe!Who gives a FUCK about having some gay Earth?Ha!"Then she queefed out a magic lightning bolt.THE END
