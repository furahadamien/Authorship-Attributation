I read the title.Hmm.I breathe in and out slowly, twisting my head side to side because of a slight headache.I'm loved, am I?And accepted for what I am?That'd be nice.A happy holiday season too?I could get behind that.I lean back in my chair, look over to where the kids are playing on the PS4, where they've *been* playing for several hours straight.I guess I can spare myself some self-loathing.They've been through a lot, and they're pretty good kids.I guess I should be allowed to be loved and accepted, even if it's just one day a year.Maybe next year I'll do a little better.Maybe one day I'll do more than just exist, and earn a little more of that time being loved and accepted.Today, I think to myself, was pretty okay.I know others have it harder, so I should be grateful I guess.Yeah, have a good one, /r/writingprompts.I'll try to, too.
