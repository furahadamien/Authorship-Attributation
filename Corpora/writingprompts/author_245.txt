First contact was made almost ten years ago.They seemed well versed in warfare, in less than a day there wasn't a satellite left in the sky or a cable under the sea.Communication between nations fell to old ground bounce long range radios pulled out of mothballs.Conventional weapons proved to be ineffective and the nuclear option didn't fare much better.Eventually even the old analog radios where jammed.Steadily they started to wipe us out.Great mechanized beasts roamed the land, directed energy weapons reduced any caught in there sight to ash.Slowly word began to spread of old legends come to light.Wizards, witches even warlocks making pacts with demons to gain power.Men and women alike where seen calling fourth searing bolts of lighting from the sky.Ripping the ground open to devour and crush any of the aliens creations that wandered to close to the last bastions of humanity.Liquefying the great metal monsters with conjured fire.Even death was no relief to our fallen comrades as the necromancers raised forth gargantuan armies of the dead.Crushing the invaders with the sheer mass of rotting meat and gleaming bone.As our species continued to fight for our existence more of the things that go bump in the night started coming to light.At first they appeared to be fellow humans but it soon became clear that was not the case.The first were the Werewolves, nigh unkillable but by blessed silver.Transforming into great beasts they used claws and teeth to rend through armor only magic could penetrate.These furry juggernauts relied on humans not for food as in the old tales but as breeding stock.As we continued to dwindle in number they could no longer stalk the shadows.Though small in numbers they made up for it in shear brutality.Soon all of the others concealed in the shadows made themselves known.The vampires where less well received than the wolves but in the end they needed us.Becoming a donor for one elevated ones physically abilities for a time.Though to somes disappointment, crosses, sunlight and garlic did not faze them.The Fae became another ally though much less trustful, one had to be cautious when speaking with them.Never make an open ended bargain with one, it never ends in your favor.Whatever the invaders mechanized army consisted of it was not iron and they seemed to take much glee in the wanton destruction they could wield.Many hopped the elves and dwarves of some fairy tales would come to be but to this day none have materialized.Though the dragons made there presence known they more are focused on what little territory they still held and if you happen to occupy it you have one hell of a home security system.Rumblings of the old gods walking among man once more have been heard but not verified.As of now hope has yet to completely die for humanity and its newly rediscovered allies.While the dragons and invaders still rule the skies we have done much to retake the land.The current status of humanity as a whole is still not truly known, while magic is useful as a weapons it does not give it self over willingly to be used to pass missives.Communication over the oceans and across continents is still a slow process and we are just starting to retake the seas.-Field Commander, 3rd Magus Division, Capt Jasper D.
