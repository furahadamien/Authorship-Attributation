First time, and typed on a phone in the middle of  the night.Please be gentle...The book, if you could call it a book, was handed to me with an air of indifference that I did not believe was befitting of my life.A cross between what I understood as a hard drive and a chose your owb adventure, all of the billions upon billions of versions of me were stored upon this one device.I looked up.The thing that had handed me the device was gone.All that was left was the burning curiousity and the fright that I had wasted my life.I skimmed through my life.Love, loss, success, failure.From my first kiss to the death of my father, every moment.I relived it all, just as realistic as if it was the present.I stopped.I had lived my life.Time to see the path of an alternate me.School gymnasium, 1998.Final year of school.I chose differently.No longer did I ask for Angela's number after the exam.Instead, I sat in anticipation, waiting to feel the difference of my life without her.Without my Angel.Ready to see if I could bear my life without her.I waited, slumped, head down at my desk.My life, lost, in a moment.I wasn't sure if I was ready to see if I could live without her.I hear feet approach my desk.Somewhere, outside the gymnasium, she would be saying her goodbyes.Where I was, those 20 years ago.My life had been short, but it had been worth it with her."Hi".I looked up.She had waited.
