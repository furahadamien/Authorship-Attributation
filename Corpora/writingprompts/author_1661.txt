So anyway, I'm kind of seeing someone right now.We met when he helped me fix a chicken soup recipe that had gone badly wrong and then it turned out that every time I used that hob it opened a gate to Hell and dragged him into my kitchen.And because that always happened, and Father O'Flannery is getting a bit old for three exorcisms a week, we decided that we'd just hang out like friends.But he's super-cute, if a little hairy, and really attentive.Pretty much the opposite of Brian, if you can imagine that.I know Abraxiel, Tormentor of the Lost and Captain of the Host of Megido, isn't my normal type but you have to look past stereotypes and try new things!Anyhow, Abraxiel is really widening my horizons.He's really into art and very in touch with his feelings.Like, remember how Brian used to compete with, like, every guy in the room?Abraxiel doesn't do that.He's so secure in who he is, it just gives me the space to really be me, you know?All that being what it is, we didn't stay "just friends" very long.I find it really hard to say no to him!But I know what you're thinking and no!We haven't!I mean, I want to (so bad!)but Abraxiel is an old fashioned kind of guy and he wants to wait until I'm ready to commit.And I'm nearly ready.We complete each other.He's such an old soul, and he says he can see how beautiful MY soul is, and he wants to be around it for all eternity, and O know he means it which is just off the charts romantic!I can't wait for you two to meet!
