It took me some time to figure out what I was going to do with such a great power.I was always the introverted type.Never really had no friends and anyone who I used to love passed away.I've been decaying away in my own apartment.The place is a mess.I don't really love anyone but myself.The cancer is starting to catch up.I'm gonna go to my own place.Paradise.Police report from the following day:

A young man with cancer has recently committed suicide by stabbing his neck.The knife hit the jugulars.Unfortunately he must have had a slow and painful death to allow his final thoughts to pass through his head.Surprisingly the knife was never found, but he died from a knife wound.No one in the man's building was able to identify the man and no family was able to be contacted.If you know anything about this man please call the police.
