Dys-funk-shun-all
Mostly it would be the in and out aspect of reality.If you think of reality as an ocean im standing just below the tideline, reality comes and washes my feet or sweeps up to my knees or im totally dry for hours or days, i could be in the middle of anything but when the tide goes out theres no distinction between thought and outside world and neither makes sense.Also definitely I relate to drug abuse to find realitt, went through that song and dance.Never had a voice who was nice enough to even offer rent, they tend to be hateful assholes all the time
