A dim buzzing, the sound of eardrums bursting I'm sure.After many years in the queen's service I knew the sound well.I open my blood caked eyes for a moment.Try to take in my surroundings.I see a blue sky, muddled by smoke.Lead hornets buzzing over head.I look down to see my pristine red uniform leaking into the soil beneath me.A melted candle on many a widow's mantle.I close my eyes for just a moment.The war can wait.. for just.. one.. second..I awaken in a grand hall.The splendor of which I've never seen!Delicate rose walls reach to a saffron sky, and the seat I find myself in is fit for an emperor.I look to the side to see a vanity mirror the size of my entire body and find that I have aged considerably.My once clean shaven face now adorned with a grey beard that reaches to my chest.My uniform is whole and perfect.A voice breaks my concentration "more tea captain nuts?"My face screws up in confusion as I turn toward the voice.A faux regal squeak booms from a young girl across the table.Her smile is genuine and she is flanked at either side by a tiger and an elephant.If this is to be my new queen I would hat to see who would dare go against her.
