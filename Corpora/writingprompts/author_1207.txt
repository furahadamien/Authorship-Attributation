I wasn't feeling good.I had worked too much and eaten too little.This wasn't uncommon, per se, but it was worse than the other times.So many developments recently.I was thinking about them now since I had just been reminded of them by another post.I met the fist person in my life that's ever expressed the same interests and feelings toward my passions of music and video games.I met a recruiter at work who said I just needed 50 on the ASVAB to get into the Navy with my GED (I had gotten a 91).I learned that I should talk with a therapist instead of a psychologist to overcome some emotional and mental hardships in my life.I can go back to school next fall for free and not give up like a loser this time.I have opportunities again and am more mature than when I last had and squandered my opportunities.For the first time in a long time, I had a tiny sliver of hope.Now I just needed to get through the rest if the season.I just wanted to get that off my chest, and I knew it.It felt wrong, because I didn't feel like I was actually contributing to the topic, but I hoped it would be okay.
