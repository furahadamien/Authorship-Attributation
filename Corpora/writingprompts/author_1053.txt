Everyone has seen "The Wizard of Oz", right?As the Munchkins said, "follow the yellow brick road!", so I lived my life.Though the road I followed was neither yellow, brick, nor visible to anyone but myself.I saw the lines for the first time at the age of twelve.They appeared, almost at random, as I was walking on the way home from school.One green line, leading off into one direction, and a red line going off into another.The red line was an indescribably harsh, violent shade of red, while the green line was soft and inviting like a crisp field of grass.Naturally, I followed the green line.At first, the green's rewards were small blessings.The first thing the line led me to was a dollar bill lying on the ground.After that, numerous mundane conveniences that I can't much recall.What I will never forget, is about 6 months after the lines started to guide my life, I was walking with my father.I noticed the green line veer into a nearby alleyway.I urged my dad to come with me, though I couldn't explain why.He was annoyed with me at first, but that all changed when he saw the animal lying on its side near the back of the alley, barely breathing.A small golden retriever pup, a stray that had gotten into a fight with some other animal.Dad and I hurried it to the nearest vet.I remember how surprised dad was at the fact that I knew the exact way to the clinic.He never knew I had a little help.That puppy would make a full recovery and become our loyal family dog.Mom and dad let me name it, and I chose St. Patrick.I told them it was because he was lucky we found him.Though we often shortened his name to "Patter" due to his habit of patting the ground with his front paws whenever he wanted attention.Years went on, and the green line's rewards continued to grow exponentially, as did its influence on my life.I noticed one day that people who would help me would be surrounded by a green aura, while those who were no good for me had red.I learned that the hard way when I agreed to go on a date with a girl I liked in college, despite her crimson aura.Things seemed fine at first, as they usually do, only to result in one of the ugliest breakups of my life.She took my car, kicked me out of our apartment, and had Patter put to sleep as some form of retribution against me.It was then I theorized that as the rewards of the green line increase in greatness, the punishments of the red line increase equally so.At that point, I dubbed the lines "Karmic paths".After the mishap with that girl, the green path must have thought I needed even more help.I began to see red and green words whenever I read any documents printed or digital.As I listened to people speak, I could "hear" the redness or the greenness of their words.I became a walking lie detector.I decided to put this into good use.I immediately downloaded a video game off the internet, and began to read through the EULA.I could see, plain as day, the parts that were written simply as standard practice, and the fine print put there to prey on the buyer.The green path continued to lead me in this way for many more years.I decided to reap the benefits of this perceptiveness and start playing the stock market.That is how I made my fortune.I decided to spend my newfound wealth on a night out for my friends and I, which is how I met my wife at a nearby club.For a long time, things were great!I lived comfortably, loved abundantly, and hadn't a care in the world!That is, until the hue changed...I noticed the once vibrant green hue surrounding my best friend suddenly change to a harsh red overnight.I was dumbfounded.He was practically a brother to me, how could he do me any wrong?I continued the conversation as normally as I could, when eventually I mentioned my wife.The red around him grew more intense.The sense of dread this gave me tied my guts into knots.I choked out the words the best I could."Would you like to have dinner with us tonight?"Never before has the word "yes" sounded so... red to me.When I arrived home later that night I saw what I feared most: an oppressive, red aura surrounding my wife.We exchanged the normal pleasantries, the "welcome home!"and the "how was work?", et cetera et cetera.I quickly shut myself up in my office and started thinking.How could things end up this way?I had followed the green path faithfully for decades!Why would it wrong me now?What can I do?Then I saw it.Convergence.The green path and the red path, perfectly perpendicular to each other.Tracing them with my eyes from my feet, across the room, and out the window of my top floor office.There they ended, together.I got up from my desk and followed them, until I was upon the window overlooking the tranquil city streets.I heard the ding of the elevator as it reached our floor.I heard my best friend and wife greet each other, then whisper something between themselves.I looked at the outstretched paths of red and green scaling the tower I had built with my choices lead downwards.I opened the window and took that last step on my path.I spent so much time enjoying the boon of the green path that I forgot the thing that remains true for both fortune and misfortune.This too, shall pass.
