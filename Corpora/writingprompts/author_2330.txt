ManifestationsOfYou
If history outlives me, I'm sure that I'll be remembered as pragmatic, forward thinking, hell, maybe even lucky.The truth of the matter though, I'm just lazy.Sometimes I think I'm just too lazy to die, a perpetual life fueled by an insatiable apathy.Eat your vegetables, make sure you exercise, drink water, take your vitamins, don't smoke.These were the mantra's of my time.Perhaps *my time* isn't the right phrase, as I'm still alive, and being one of only a few people alive, the majority of time could be considered mine.The time I'm speaking of is the time of man, the time of society, the time of mantras.It seems foreign to me now after so many years of walking this earth with no schedule, no societal debt to spend my life paying off, just living.So here I am.Today is my 900th birthday, I haven't heard any mantras of any kind in centuries; there are no more cigarettes to smoke, no more vegetables to eat, no point in exercise or vitamins.But there's water.You could call me contrarian I suppose, but that's really the result, not the cause of why I'm here.Going back as far as my memory allows, which is at about age 5 or so, I was told nearing incessantly, to drink water, that I needed to stay *hydrated*.I never understood it, water had no taste and I had no taste for it, yet everyone was sure tat I wanted it and needed it.At such a young age every cognition boils down to cause and effect, almost instinctively so, but even then something seemed off; everyone had these rules to live by, though no one had set them, these nuances followed by all and understood by none.And yet, no matter how strictly one followed these rules, they all met the same end, they all died.I wasn't buying it (because I was 5 and didn't have money yet).After centuries of giving meaning where there is none, attributing fate or pragmatism to what is really just luck, I think back to those years with a vindictive righteousness that is only quelled by the all consuming loneliness that one can only experience when they're truly right.I was right alright, the rules that everyone had been slave too were unsurprisingly what did them in in the end.And every day was a testament to just how right I was; every night a testament to how wrong I wish I was.I'm not entirely alone though, there's other people out there, other people like me.Other people who are so set on being unique, on being right, people so stubborn, that they would swear off breathing if they found out other people did it.We all walk the earth aimlessly and alone, avoiding each other for the fear that upon confrontation one of us would be forced to drink water, to concede death, just to prove they're different.I don't say this as hyperbole.I say this as fact.I say this as the last air bubble surfaced the glass of water in front of me, almost reflecting the spiteful glare from the stranger I had just met.I'd love to embellish and say that that glass of water tasted of pride as I swallowed it, but the truth of the matter is, it didn't taste like anything, it was still just water.So after 900 years of trying to be different, of riding the high of being ultimately right, I ended up no different than every other person before me, and just as wrong.I don't think anything had ever felt so right.
