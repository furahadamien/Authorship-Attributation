Language, I thought to myself.There is something more to it all then just my actions. This tree I now found myself in had new meaning.Before it was something indescribable.I had not the words, nor the capacity to describe it before, but Ive now come across this greatness, these tools to create more than my eyes can see.I have a new power to name, a new game to create.Sure, what seems like a few hours ago, I could have done the same, but had I possessed the wisdom?I surely doubted it.I stood up and looked around.The world around me had such a different feeling.Was I alone in this wisdom?Had others before me, my ancestors, my family too, had they also achieved a similar sense of satisfaction, knowing that the world has become a playground to master?These questions rose in my head, and it started to spin.The voices I heard at the end there, I had not a clue as to who they were, but they promised me a good life after death.But to me they had another request.You have been freed by our hand, they said, and so now it comes your time to create too. 

I thought for a bit, pondering how I should go about this.Had I enough power to create all those future gods had alone?I thought not.I needed friends, people who shared a common will.I needed to share this wisdom so together we could build such a house?It became difficult to recall all the ways we used to describe it.And this is where I think the trouble started.Those who I told lost their innocence in the world.Their blissful ignorance had been brutally slaughtered.Whats more is some of those to whom I shared my wisdom used it against what I wanted to create.They wanted a world full of pleasure and delight, but not everyone valued that in the other world.I had no idea of where I was, nor who I really was, but yet, I felt a sense of duty towards worshiping the shrine of those who gave me this opportunity.We had to start somewhere, and we needed water.So I named my tree, the beautiful web of rational thought which I felt too shared this power of wisdom with the mushroom, which shall be where others too will learn the ways of the world.Then I began to build the house of fame.
