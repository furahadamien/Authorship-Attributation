*Pew**Pew**Pew*

A body lays before me.A body people used to love and look up to.Smoke is still trailing from the silenced pistol.Is he dead?Is he dead is he dead?I think hes dead.Is he dead?*Pew**Pew**Pew*

He might not be.He might be.But he might not be.*Pew**Pew**Pew*

That cant do.That cant do that cant do.He must die.We must kill him.Kill him.*Pew**Pew**Pew*

These people these things are not human.We cannot cannot keep them alive.We must erase them.The irregularities.The bugs.Gods mistakes.Should we have kept him alive?Maybe we should have kept him alive.We couldve attracted more of them if we kept him alive.No.We must kill now, or we will be killed.What should we do?What do we do?Do we lay low?Should we be done for the night?What if they find us?No.This is our duty.We do not take breaks.We will continue.We will kill whoever gets in our way.Whos next?Should Snowman be next?I think Snowman should be next.Snowmans next.Then off we go.
