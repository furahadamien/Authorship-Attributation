"The Council has decided ", a deep yet piercing voice broke the stifling silence."Death Walker though you have shown yourself to be a villain of outstanding calibre, we believe it is a little too early for you.We are sorry to say but you have been passed for the promotion.""Rejected again huh.""It does not matter.""Care for a drink?"...

"What the hell is wrong with those pieces of shit in the council.They have passed on me for the third straight fucking year.Does a man not deserve to be compensated according to his efforts?I deserved it.Fuck.""Need a refill?", Wolf was already experienced in dealing with Death Walker's ranting episodes by now.He took pleasure in seeing the normally sombre and sincere Death rant and complain like a child."I met all the targets and more, I cut down on medical costs, we even saw an increase in revenue in my area after I had exterminated those pesky heroes.I have been saving the council so much money but do they reward me?No, instead I am told that I lack the necessary experience for the position.That I am not ready for it yet.They promoted that idiot Wraith.The same guy that got his ass handed to him by some stupid kids with a super dog.Can you fucking believe it?""Another refill please", Wolf called out to the bartender.He looked at the face of his companion.A chiselled handsome face that would not look out of place on cover of magazines, if not for the hollow eye sockets where resided flames as dark as night, flickering occasionally showing emotion that betrayed Death's poker face.Wolf did not know a lot about Deaths history.He had met this young villain four or five years back and by that time Death had already made a name for himself.He had killed almost all the heroes present in his assigned section, destroyed the regional headquarters of the Superhumans for Humans Federation and effectively erased the presence of SfHP from his area altogether.The council did not like his methods.Death was a threat to their old ways.He procured Deaths performance review but could not bring himself to show it to him.He had quite enjoyed the review and the choice comments made on Deaths accomplishments and activities.Killed the captured hero immediately without explaining his grand plan.Completely illogical.

Executed a plan in complete secrecy.Did not give the federation even a small hint about the scheme.Cannot understand the reason behind his actions.

Uses extremely simple tools.Did not even touch the convoluted contraptions budget.Something is wrong with this man.

A smirk appeared on his face remembering the comments.He looked at his companion again.This man would lead them to greatness.The Council needed change and Wolf had decided that, he would pave the way for it.
