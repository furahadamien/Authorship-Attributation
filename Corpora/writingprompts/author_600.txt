What would you like today boss?

Something strong and dark, I think its gonna be a long night.

Coming right up!

As the scruffy barista retreated behind the bar, Edith listened to the rain thrumming against the windows of the coffee shop, obscuring the sleepy city street outside and doing wonders for her already dreary mood.She hated fieldwork, took no pleasure in it, and certainly didnt enjoy being sent across the country for one single target.But still, here she was, one week into her assignment and not a single lead- the runaway this time was like a ghost, leaving only a few clues leading all the way to this dead end of a city.The light clatter of porcelain from the kitchen roused her from her thoughts, and Edith looked around the shop, taking in the cozy little business with a keen eye.The interior was shabby, to say the least, with a hodgepodge of comfortable armchairs, eclectic collection of tables, mismatched dishes, and a garish orange-brown paint job that loudly advertised the owners utter lack of aesthetic sense.But the smell that hung in the place was divine, and for that Edith could forgive quite a lot.The barista himself was young, shaggy, and muscular, wearing a tight-fitting shirt and a pair of jeans.If he hadnt been the one behind the bar and the spatter of brown stains on his clothes, she wouldve assumed he was just another patron.But there were no other patrons- the only other customer had left soon after she had arrived.Odd- she looked at the barista again, at the faux-casual lean and the errant dart of his eyes.Was he-

Here you go Boss.

Edith jolted in her seat, almost knocking the coffee from the baristas hands in surprise.Unphased, the barista smoothly swung the coffee away from her, and then back again without spilling a drop.Nodding apologetically, Edith accepted the steaming beverage and leaned back in her seat.The barista gave a short bow, and retreated once more to the safety of his bar.Sipping at the steaming liquid, Edith looked over the case file once more.The runaway was a class 0 threat according to the dossier, with only enough power to fly a kite indoors.Despite that he had been a part of Sanctuary- the largest villain group to date, and was reportedly one of their inner circle according to one of the few bits of information the retrievers could get their hands on.The group had completely disappeared a few years ago, yet here was one of their top brass, alone, standing awkwardly behind the bar- as if daring her to make the first move.Letting out a low sigh and slowly shifting her body, she took another, much larger sip, fully appreciating the flavor for the first time.The coffee is delicious.

It really was.Thank you, Boss.

His bright green eyes were intense and unblinking.He knew.What flavor is it, if you dont mind me asking?

Slowly, with her hand hidden below the table, Edith reached for the gun at her hip.Nostalgia.

Before Edith could bring the gun to bear, the table before her shot forward and slammed into her chest- knocking her deep into the plush depths of the armchair.*Threat level 0 my ass*, she thought as starbursts exploded across her vision.Gasping for breath, she pressed one hand to the fabric of the armrest, and another onto the table that was pinning her down.In an instant, the table went limp, and she threw it away from her, spinning the hardened armchair around to block another weaponized table.It bounced off harmlessly, and in the short lull that followed Edith drew her gun, aimed at the shocked barista, and pulled the trigger.His eyes went wide as the small electric dart whizzed through the air and impacted into his shoulder, causing him to spasm violently and fall, hitting his head on the counter on the way down.*Ouch*.Edith winced apologetically.She really hated field work.Taking a deep breath, she rounded the corner of the bar and stood over his still-twitching body.I am Officer Edith Brown of the Retriever Task Force, you are under arrest.

Edith leaned down, reaching for his forehead, recalling several pleasant memories to tide him over while she worked on a much more believable backstory to feed him back home.But then a small torn photograph floated into view and she froze, hand inches from his face.The image was faded and worn, featuring a gaggle of gap-toothed children gathered together at one end of a sterile white room.I know who you are, Boss.

Before she could even begin to comprehend the contents of the photo, Edith flew backwards- impacting lightly onto the painted stone wall of the shop.The barista stood, seemingly unharmed, an unspent electric dart floating a few inches above his upraised palm.His words were hard and sharp, but his eyes were another matter altogether- red-rimmed and damp.Once more the photograph floated up before her eyes, and Edith looked harder at the worn piece of paper, pushing against the invisible force that held her down to grab hold of it.Youre the Boss.Ive been waiting for you.


Just a misdirection, just like all the rest.Desperate rage, excuses, pleas, desperate cries for mercy, but mostly just lies- they all try the same tricks when trying to escape the law.Its why she hated fieldwork the most- all it takes is one touch and then it doesnt matter anymore, but until then it was all just such a pain.Empowering her arm for one desperate push, Edith grabbed hold of the photograph and swapped it with the wall, slamming her heel backwards to break the paper blocks that held her captive.The wall crumbled under the force of the blow, distracting the barista long enough for her to draw her gun once more, aim, and fire.The dart caught him in the neck, and with a stuttering wail the barista flopped uselessly to the floor.*Got him!*

*Damn telekenetics* She rubbed her aching muscles and turned, placing one hand on the soggy paper blocks and undoing the damage- returning the wall back to its original shape and form.Looking down at the crumpled lacquer photograph in her hand, Edith deflated, and returned it to its original form too.Actually looking at the image for the very first time, she wondered why he had been so insistent on the thing.He hadnt even tried to run, he definitely had the power to, so why bother?She certainly didnt remember him, but from the beginning every word out of his mouth seemed to imply that he knew her.And then she saw them- a boy and a girl, side by side among the jumble of kids.One meek and despondent looking with a mop of messy blonde hair, and the other tall, dark-haired, and defiant- and an exact match to a photograph in her fathers apartment.It had always looked a little off, and now she knew why.Reaching for her phone, she cut it, and then reached for his forehead.If he really did know her, and she had a reasonable idea why, then she had to know the rest of the truth.
