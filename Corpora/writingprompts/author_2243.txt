It had been twenty years since we had received the first communication from intelligent life.We knew we weren't alone, but, perhaps in our own hubris, we had assumed we were the most advanced.Interstellar communication, though, was something we wouldn't have even considered.That message had changed the course of our history.Warring factions united, and countries bound together to achieve one purpose: space travel.As a species we had united under that one task.Of course, the message had been completely indecipherable, but after analyzing the tone, we found no reason to assume hostility.Still, as a defensive measure, they picked a very odd couple to embark upon this expedition.I was an intellectual at heart.I'd studied languages and communication for my entire life, but I hadn't limited myself.Over my life, I'd earned a rapport as one of the best architects and engineers in my planet, and I'd taken up a hobby of gardening.With all of this, I suppose I was a logical choice, but I was still dumbfounded when the World Government approached me - a relative nobody to them.One of my companions, Kharr, was a tournament winner every sport, as well as a skilled warrior.Of course, he wasn't the typical thoughtless solider - he had also studied construction materials.To round off our group, we had a scientist, Aida.After twenty years of world peace and collaboration, they had chosen their representatives.The three of us were the group to whom they entrusted the all-important First Contact.Inherently, the mission was dangerous, of course.We could have misinterpreted their message in hundreds of ways, and it was very possible that it was a war cry or a warning in general.However, if we landed, we were tasked with making contact and hopefully establishing a relationship.This species surely had a surplus of information  to teach, and our job was to just be the ideal students.Even after preparing for the mission for the past decade, I felt completely terrified as I sat in the Rest Chamber.We were set on an automatic course to take us to the origin of the signal, which we'd traced to a planet nearly three billion light years away.With the collective intelligence of our greatest minds, faster than light travel had become possible by harnessing nuclear reactions which allowed manipulation of atomic mass in the ship's core."Are you ready for this?"Nalshir, the head physicist, asked me.The other two had already been laid to rest, but I was hesitant.As the captain, I felt as though I should be awake for the travel, in case something went wrong.However, they'd explained to me a dozen times, that the chambers were specifically designed to defend our bodies from the pressure of massless travel."No," I laughed, shaking my head sadly."I'd question your sanity if you were.""Let's do this," I nodded.Taking one more deep breath, I laid back into the chamber and watched the door close over me.I didn't dream.That was the most striking part to me, as strange as it may be.The sleep, however long it lasted, seemed instantaneous.The moment the door closed, it opened once again.My first thought was that the mission had been cancelled, or that they'd forgotten to give me a crucial piece of information.As the chamber opened, I expected to see Nalshir's face, but I was greeted with an empty ship.&#x200B;
