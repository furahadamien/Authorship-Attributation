There was something weird about this day

Harold, my brother, was acting weird as if he had seen something.Ending school i went home.Everything seemed just fine.Lots of love from my family.Don't know about my dad though, he disappeared 10 years ago.Everytime he went to buy cigarretes he   was quick.Not this time though.Reappering home was my dad.Something was wrong.like if he was...Confused.for him not even 30 minutes had gone by 

Rarely ever felt bad for dad since he dissapeared.He had abandoned us.On the other hand, he might have been kidnapped.Like that would stop him.Dad was badass.Like, he would beat a thousand men in a fist to fist fight.So... " what happened? "I asked him

Sometimes i thought he ran away with....

Kristen, his secret lover."You didnt do that did you?"he didnt like that question

Rapidly he punches me in the jaw.In seconds i'm on the ground.My head spins as i wake up and hear a familiar voice."You were trying to cross the border right?"I quickly read the first letters on each sentence.Damn you Todd Howard.
