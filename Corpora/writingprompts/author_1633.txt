Its a dark night in the city, and as I look around, its almost like for the first time.It was only then that you remember the fight, kind of coming back as a hazy recollection of events.As my memory slowly returns, I continue look around at the city around me, not sure which way to go.Everything looked way different then I remembered.It was then that I remembered what happened.Someone had tried to rip me off and we got into a fight and I was hit in the head.It was then that I noticed the broken VR lying off to the side of the alley near a ominous door.As I go over to pick it up I realize that it was the one that I had put on 20 years ago.Shocked, I dropped it back on the ground and I started at it... what had I really been doing the last 20 years of my life...
