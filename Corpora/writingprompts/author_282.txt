Jess could pinpoint exactly when she first thought her feelings were wrong: eighth grade after Advanced Algebra.Her friend Katie got an 82% on a test and that was disastrously low for Katies norm, and considered even lower by her parents standards.Jess spent the rest of the class period trying to cheer her friend up:

Its one test it doesnt define you.Youre amazing and good at everything.Youre kind and pretty, and this is just a small hiccup!I know youll ace the next test!I know it!We can study together and youll probably be saving me from failing, like you normally do.

When Katie smiled back at her, with a red nose, and puffy eyes, Jess knew that she felt something more for her friend.Jess, of course, buried her feelings.By no means was she homophobic, but every time she began to feel something for a friend or looked too long at a woman that walked by, she felt unsure of herself, felt like others would somehow know what she was thinking and judge her.So she buried it down at least, until college.Jess decided that she would at least try to get into the dating world.Shed go to parties with her friends, and when guys would be interested in her, shed flirt back and have some fun and she did, in fact, enjoy her time with most of these guys.So she continued to have fun at parties, flirt, have some friends with benefits, but nothing substantial.Jess liked these guys, of course, but nothing felt like the dramatic and raw feeling of love and emotion that she always heard about from her friends.She decided it was time to start seriously dating time to find Mr Right, and then she would start to understand how all her friends felt with their boyfriends.They even said it themselves, You just havent found the right guy, Jess.

The first few relationships Jess was in did not last long barely even a relationships since they were only a handful of dates and kisses over two or three months before parting ways.Then she met Matt.He was gorgeous all of Jesss friends said so and he was very into her.Jess, I havent been completely honest, he said one night during a dinner date two months into their relationship.Um what?

The first time I met you, it wasnt at that coffee shop.We were actually at the same college we had a lecture together for one semester.I saw you at a couple parties too. 

Oh, Jess said, relieved to find out she wasnt a side-chick or that his secret wasnt relationship-ending but she realized that, maybe she didnt really care if their relationship ended anyway.Thats okay.I dont remember seeing you though.

I realized that at the shop, he said smiling a bit sheepishly, but we didnt really talk and I looked a bit different back then.

Jess broke up with Matt three months later.How could you break up with him?He was so hot! Regina, her roommate and best friend since college, told her.There wasnt any spark he was kind of a doormat.He had no personality and went with whatever I said.

That sounds like the perfect man to me. Jess threw the couch pillow at her.Okay, okay no man slaves.Hey wanna watch a movie tonight?

And Jess never felt more comfortable, more at home, than sharing a blanket with Regina on their couch and watching a crappy movie.Regina moved out six months later to live with her boyfriend.Are you bringing Cam to the engagement party? Regina asked her half a year later.Most people Jim and I invited are bring their boyfriends or girlfriends.

Jess had been dating Cameron for five months now, and things were nice.They liked all of the exact same things, worked in similar fields, had the same hobbies everyone said they were perfect for each other.Yeah, he said hell come.You said to come for dinner at eight?Is there anything I could bring?Dessert?Wine?

You know we always appreciate more wine but weve got plenty already.All you have to do is bring yourself.And Cam.

Just a few weeks after Reginas wedding eight months later, Jess broke it off with Cam.The wedding itself was beautiful, and Jess couldnt bear to make Regina worry by breaking up with Cam before it.But Jess I love you we love each other!We love all the same foods and places.We even listen to the same music and watch the same shows we were perfect for each other this time!

Thats the thing, Cam, I dont want someone whos the same as me.I dont want to date myself.I want to date someone thats different and will push my boundaries make me try new things maybe Ill find things that I never even knew I liked before 

She thought of all the men shes dated in the past: they were all the same.They were all Nice Guys that were nice and sweet but had nothing to them each relationship was hollow and lacked any true, real substance.How many men had she gone on dates with?15?20?And none of them made her feel any different.She longed to feel the feelings she felt for her friends with anyone who wasnt her friends.Maybe, she thought, maybe she could.She was so tired, she had nothing to lose.Cam, were through.Im sorry if its sudden, but Im tired of everything I have been for a while now, even before I met you.

Well...I hope you meet someone one day, Cam said after a long moment.Maybe whoever you date next will be the right man for you.

Jess remained quiet as Cam packed up the few things he had in her apartment.She doubted any man would be right for her.It took her two weeks to text Regina and ask her to meet her for drinks on Friday night.Hey, Jess isnt this a gay bar that were going to?I heard its a lot of fun, she said while they were walking.Yeah I wanted to check it out, Jess said.They walked in silence for a minute before Jess nerves got to her.Ok wait, stop walking for a sec.I I need to tell you.Were not going to this bar just for fun I think Im bi or a lesbian.I dont really know.

Oh okay, Regina said after a moment.How long do you think youve known?

Eighth grade.I told you about Katie from high school right?

Oh .Yeah that makes sense, Regina thought for a moment.Ok you ready to start walking again?Its cold.

Jess couldnt be happier, and hanging out at a bar with her best friend, and the flutters in her stomach when other women came up to them to flirt it was one of the best nights shes had in a long time.And that same bar is where she met Taylor three weeks later.There was something about her something that made Jess feel like they knew each other for a long time.They liked a lot of the same things, but were different enough that things were still interesting.There were some things that were a bit quirky though.Taylor was really bad at shaving her legs she would always nick them multiple times every time she shaved.She was also really bad with makeup and couldnt tell concealer from foundation.She never had any pads or tampons in her apartment either.Jess had never asked her about it, but she hoped nothing traumatic happened to Taylor that would cause her period to stop.Taylor also had a whole ton of mens clothing in her apartment.For all her quirks though, Jess felt better with Taylor than she had with any of the men in her past.
