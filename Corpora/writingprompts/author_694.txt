I saw heaven as I slit my wrist.It was a cold day in December, I recall.Windier than usual, which in my climate by the equator, was welcomed happily.The oppressive heat had disappeared, inviting cooler days, where we no longer had to sweat, and delightfully chilly nights, where folks living with no air conditioning slept comfortably.I had reached a new level of low in my life.My studies hadn't worked out, my parents were upset, they refused my decision to find jobs and sent to me study accounting locally.My friends were all gone, replaced by new people that I didn't know, didn't want to know, refused to know.I've not had love in 3 years, me being the hopeless romantic that I am, and my cousins all look down upon me.I had found the dagger in a junk yard one day, in October.The blade was still sharp, unrusted.What was left of my mental functions, all but eaten away by my depression, told me this dagger would deal 1d4 damage, and I probably had only 10 hitpoints.I shrugged, and pocketed it.The next month and a bit was torturous, even more so.I started to have feelings of wanting to kill.It first started as a gentle nudge, that someone will be happier if I just took the dagger and stabbed.It then became a a plea, then finally bloodlust.I had long night drives to desolate fields, drinking, smoking, screaming.It was hell.That day, I couldn't take it anymore.I just pierced my skin before I heard

*a melody*

coming from the wound I made.And with that melody, a vision appeared.It was a planet, exactly like ours, yet I saw no cities, no roads, nothing of civilisation.The only technological thing I saw was a sort of factory, where wind turbines spun, and the ceiling adorned with solar panels.A voice came, as I entered the factory, my vision coasting in through the doors, down a shaft, down to a futuristic city underground.It explained the extinction of my world, the other life forms that predicted it, the backup plans they had made, one of which was this.We had much to do, but if everyone made it there, we will thrive again.It promised bountiful resources, security, and life.It promised comfort, peace, and happiness, if we played our cards right.It promised paradise.I dropped the blade on the floor, the vision gone.I was breathing heavily, a little blood trickling out of my wound.*"Do you see, now?"*

Oh yes.Yes I do.I pick up the dagger once more.I had a job to do.(Possible part 2)

The paper sword burns in the pyre, falling to ashes.A ghostly apparition of a sword appears, and I grab it.I readjust my spectacles, the one my girlfriend had bought for me just before she got into an accident, resulting in a coma.She now hovers right by the edge of my vision, her mouth set in a thin line."Lim Kai Yang, I didn't go into a coma," said Hui Xin, arms crossed, "so that you can go potentially kill yourself as well."I test the sword with my ghostly hand.Well balanced, easy to swing, and...I reach it to my dead elbow, and slowly slide it across.Sharp enough to make my hand almost disappear and lose my grip on the sword, but it reforms, and I am prepared once more."No, you didn't."I sadly look at her."But this will help.I promise."She glares, before floating off.If I follow her, I'll end up having tea with her dazed parents, trying to act strong, and her emotionally retreated brother.I sigh, and make my way for the warehouse.************
