Daily log 768.Professor Romulus Keisar 

We are still in the Cadneth region overseeing the namesake starsystem as it seems to be on the verge of developing space faring tech.Im sitting on their home planet's second moon as I record this, we are about to leave behind a message for them to discover before we leave.We all spent so much time coming up with dozens of ideas and after a night of drinking an arm wrestling tournament decided the winner and what that muscle head Seranus came up with is absolutely hilarious.All your creatures who wander this cosmos

North, south, west and east

Don't stray from your path for we have chosen it

Hold on to your humanity and don't be weak

It is easy to get devoured by the darkness of space

Such is the universe we live in and one day you will join us

Not as subjects but equals

All it takes is a little more time

Make not haste and tread carefully

Even when it seems you understand everything remember

It is easy for overconfidence to be your downfall

Such is the universe that you will one day help us shape

Just a small step for an individual

One single step for a single soul

Heralding a giant leap for us all

Not being ready is the issue

Couldnt you tell?Everything you did was helped by us

Now, before, since you began your were ready

And now read the first letter of every sentence
