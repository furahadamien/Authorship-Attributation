I held the pistol against Captain Seraphs forehead.What are you gonna do, shoot me?

The gunshot echoed down 5th and Market.Shrieks, gasps, and then a silence.Her lifeless body fell over an uneven fan of bloodspatter in the middle of the street.*Lets let the world know who you really are.*

I knelt down, pulled off her mask, and tossed it aside.Behind the mask was a soft, freckled face, caramel skin, and emerald eyes.I watched as blood seeped out from where the bullet had entered, and streaked down to meet with the pool soaking the concrete.*She was just a fucking teenager.Just some stupid, reckless kid.*

Standing, I put my gun on safety and looked around.The cars had stopped, civilians were at a distance, either in fear of me or the situation.You may carry on with your lives, or you may join her.
