People think having money makes your life better.The ability to pay your bills on time, have no debts, and enjoy the occasional vacation sounds nice.I can understand the appeal.But no one ever talks about having too much money.Im not talking about mansions and the ability to fly in a private jet..Im talking about buying the airline company and owning entire city blocks.When you have that much money, it gets hard to find joy in the little things.I never was one for flashy living.I think knowing you have the funds to buy multiple countries, takes the joy out of life, but thats just my thoughts on the matter.And when I say that much money, I dont mean just millions.The kind of money Bill Gates has, just a couple times more.But Im not telling you that to boast.Im telling you in hopes that you may understand, but you cant, and you never will.And I suppose Im okay with that.So what does one do after years of supreme boredom?After you have bought everything worth buying?Gone everywhere worth seeing?Hell, Ive even played the Good Samaritan card, donating nearly a billion dollars to various organizations without so much as a thought.But what to do now?Get a job is what I did.The most mundane, normal job I could find.It was a large building.Nearly 70 stories tall, I worked on the 39th floor.I actually owned the building.But they didnt know that.I came in every day, from 9-5.Customer service for the products sold.The thing about customer service is people who call in think they are entitled to something.Always yelling at you over the phone.That this or that doesnt work and they demand to be compensated, or demand to speak to my supervisor.Most customer service employees never say anything rude to the customer.Hell they need the job, I get it.But I dont.I finally had enough.The day started normal, I took a couple calls, had a break, started taking calls again.Get a call, someone upset about something.I apologize for the problems, offer to troubleshoot.They ask for a manger because clearly I dont know what I am talking about.The customer continues to shout and scream at me.Then they say something that really gets to me.Me- I would be more than happy to transfer you to my supervisor, I apologize once again, please hold one moment.Customer-  Good you low life idiot.Dont have a job if you dont know what the fuck youre doing.You have waisted my time and are a disgrace to the company and society.I dont think Ive ever spoke with someone as uneducated and retarded as you, you clearly will never go anywhere in life.Transfer me you fucktard.

I laughed at the customer and her choice of words.Which was a mistake because heaven forbid anyone in the customer service industry have any feelings or defense for rudeness.People should always act professional even if someone is insulting them right?No, fuck society and they way they treat customer service people.You stupid fucks who think its okay for customers to belittle your employees are out of your mind.Thats the kind of customer you want?Entitled pricks?...no

So I transfer the customer to my supervisor.During the transfer I say hey thank you for waiting on hold and being so patient.Oh and also you can go fuck yourself you should try being a decent human being for once and not yelling at someone who is trying to help you.

The line goes silent as both my supervisor in the customer sit there in amazement of what I just sad.I hang up the phone and go about my day.About 20 minutes later I get a call that I need to go up to HR.As I arrive I step out of the elevator I already know whats coming.After a brief 10 minute conversation I am relieved of my position at the company and dismissed.As I walk out of the door I smirk.I had recorded the conversation with the customer and I. I was going to expose them to their social media friends.I paid someone 100,000 dollars to cleverly edit out my less desirable parts of the conversation.Hack into the companies data base and remove all records of my calls.And then posted  the interaction onto the mean customers Facebook page.It turns out they were politically active.And running for some small time local office.I also paid someone to manipulate the exposure the video got.It quickly rose to 10 million views, and gained local media coverage.They ended up losing their job and dropped out of the running.Friends and family of the customer I spoke with were appalled at their behavior and actions.They acted so nice on the surface.The video had been posted anonymously.The title was whose the fucktard now?.
