"Christ.We're *Fight Club*-ing now," he muttered to himself and (apparently) to his passenger who seemed to have taken a leap from chemical nuisance to sovereign entity along the way while he wasn't paying attention.James was sick.Accepting this hadn't been a struggle; not since his late teens when the vague background chatter that underscored his incapacity to hold relationships and jobs had built into a steady stream of loud and irritating nonsense, following him from social worker to group home to, eventually, a stoop down the block from the salvation army.James was sick.It wasn't news.But in a moment of weakness he had offered the devil a handshake deal."If you're gonna live in there," he'd said between gritted teeth, posing like a tough guy in the bathroom mirror of the local soup kitchen for dramatic effect, "then you have to start paying rent."Now, twenty four hours later, he peered inside of an envelope marked "Me (for January)" and counted under his breath, "twenty - forty - sixty - eighty - one hundred..."  three hundred and eighty dollars.From God knows where.James was sick.He was comfortable with that."We're *Fight Club*-ing."A thornier, more bitter pill to swallow: he was also a fucking hack.
