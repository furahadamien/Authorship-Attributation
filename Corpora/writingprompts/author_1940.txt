Shooter: Th-that's it, I challenge you to one of them battles of the olddd - an explody eye staring contest.*At this moment a young boy and his father are walking by the bizarre scene.The young boy is licking on an vanilla ice cream cone which his father just purchased for him.The young boy looks over at Phyllis and the Shooter, naturally curious*

Young boy: An explody eye contest?*The father switches from a calm composure to a state of panic*

Father: EXPLODY EYE CONTEST!Young boy!Ugmm I mean, Son!We must get out of here.AughhhahhhH!*The father swats the ice cream cone with the back of his hand out of the boy's hand and it splats onto the ground, vanilla side down.The father grabs the boy's hand and runs off*

Young boy: (Being dragged off into the distance) Yeah!Take that youu ice cream hahahaHA!*Undeterred from the commotion that they were causing by declaring the explody eye contest, Phyllis and the Shooter maintain their wide eyed stance, with their lips sucked in waving their hands above their head.Neither of them have yet to blink*

Shooter: Youuuu - uhhh, you don't stand a chance here laaady.You're gonna blink sooon and that meansss you're gonna ex-exploooode.*Phyllis' eyes begin to go bloodshot and she begins to tear up.Her eyes have become extremely dry.Phyllis takes a knife out of her pocket.*

Shooter: Whaaat do you think you're doing with that thiing you got there?Phyllis: With this thing right here I'mma, I'm gonna achieve victory at any cost!*Phyllis grabs her eyelashes and then uses the knife to cut off her eyelids.*

Phyllis: HahahaHA!I can't blink noooow.It's only a - a matter of time until you lose this explody eye contest.*Phyllis' eyes twitch as if there were blinking*

Shooter: Ooohhhh nooo, you may have done got me now.*The shooter's eyes begin to close, but then he re-opens them wide*

Shooter: But I got a secret up my sleevess haha!Yes I doooo.*The shooter throws some dust out of his pocket onto Phyllis.*

Phyllis: W-What!No it can't be!*The dust begins to radiate and glow green.The glow grows brighter and brighter until Phyllis is completely consumed by it and she turns into a large glowing blob.The blob starts to shrink as it loses its brightness and shift into the shape of a wallet.The wallet, who was previously Phyllis, now inanimately falls on the sidewalk.*

Shooter: Wooo boooy, you-uhh doooone gooot it nooow.*The shooter hops one foot at a time, landing only on his big toe over to the wallet.*

Shooter: Iiiiiiiiii am the wallllet sh-shooter guuy!*The Shooter shoots the wallet on the ground, out of it fluffs some spare change, and lies open limply on the ground with several holes in it.*

Shooter: Pow pow!That's uh what I doo, shooten all them wallets up in town haHA!*The shooter then does a back handspring and jumps into the sky where a free flying swarm of dollar bills carries him like a magic carpet into the sunset.*
