"At last, the time has come"  I Announce, as I stand over the bridge of our latest and greatest Deadnought, the Sol's Revenge, as we come within range of a cluster of planets within their home system, and their home world, Accoursi.Their homeworld stood in wait, their early warning systems had taken a few of our ships, but after heavy fighting, we have made it.Their orbital defenses have been decimated, and now we stand in wait.Our drones had covered the entire surface of the planet, and intercepted signals show of panicked alien transmissions.Some want to flee, others are preparing to launch their planetbound weapons at us.But we are prepared, we have already began Targeting these sites, confident we can strike before they can get them near us."Admiral, we await your orders" A young lieutenant  approached me.I look down, and give the order."Target the military centers, and decimate their planetal defenses, they won't be leaving this planet".It was a heavy and long fought war, but we were on the cusp of complete victory.Some people had expressed concern about what we were about to do, however, they did not show us any mercy when they had attacked us, nor have they in the decades since that horrible day.It was a day I will never forget......

In a matter of hours, a blinding flash of light, and the horrified screams of billions had come to an abrupt stop.London, New Delhi, Bejing, Los Angeles, all these cites had been decimated, their populations, and the populations of surrounding areas, all extingished.I was but a young Engineering officer, just having completed my classes.Panic abounded in the base, and in the remaining areas on Earth.Fortunately, we were prepared, even if we were laughably primitive compared to the might of the force that had just taken out many of our great cities.over half of our population had been slughtered mercillessly.I had recently recieved a report, like many of the others on the base, about the loss of families.I had lost my wife, and my parents, among with many other relatives.I was devastated, but found myself unable to cry.The weight of the loss was much, and I had felt numb.Even so, I had a job to do, and I had to do it.Our telescopes and orbital satellites had found the perpetrator, a lone, massive spaceship, not like anything we had ever seen.We did not know if it had time to strike again, or if it could at all with the kind of power it had unleashed.It was just within our orbit, and it was close enough to test out our newest weapon.We had recently developed a New type of Nuclear missile we had prepared to use in case the New USSR had declared war.However, they had collapsed upon themselves before they could attack, just like The original USSR had done  over 70 years ago.The weapon was capable of launching into space, designed to take out space based nuclear satellites that the New USSR had created to launch neutron bombs, and ordinary nukes, from anywhere in orbit.It had an EMP blast that could decimate the electronics of a satellite, turning it into junk.an explosive device took care of the satellite.We had satellites of our own, and rockets with drones, yet the alien vessel was easily taking them out.This was our last option.We took the last of our nuclear-EMP  rockets, each modified with our neutron warheads,  to take care of the alien crew.&#x200B;

 We launched the missiles, our last of the thousands of missiles we had left.Most, in fact 90% had been destroyed by the ships defenses, but we had anticipated that.It would only take one to cripple the entire vessel.a couple EMP-Neutron missiles had penetrated the hull, and crippled the vessel.the crew was killed, the radiation of the neutron missiles had taken out the crew, while leaving the ship mostly intact.We were victorious, yet at a very high cost.more than half the population was killed that day, yet we had made the most important discovery of our entire history.&#x200B;

Since that day, the nations of the world, or what was left of them, had agreed to put aside their differences, and band together.This was to be the most important project the Earth had ever undertaken.We knew the Aliens would return, but we will have their own technology to face them.The motive had remained unclear, but we went to work, combing every inch of the ship, writing, gathering intel, and even dissecting a few alien bodies that had been found inside.The technology was amazing, and in less than a decade, we had already advanced our own technology by nearly 3 centuries.We had flying vehicles, new weaponry, medicinal advances,  and even our own spaceships

&#x200B;

 in 20 years time.We had even been able to colonize other worlds in our system, the technology had allowed up to quickly expand our numbers, and to keep them from harm.However, we had not had it easy all that time.25 years since that day, we had recieved reports of 2 outlying colonies going offline, when our ships had made it, we found they were glassed by the same weapons that had attacked the earth before.Apparently they had found out we were still alive.A war had begun, and despite heavy losses, we had had in time, repelled the invaders, and had since began an offensive that had forced them back to their own system.We had encountered a few other types of ships as well, possibly allies of theirs, yet they were much less powerful than the fleet.What surprised us further is the knowledge that the alien technology was no more advanced than the day they attacked the earth 25 years before.&#x200B;

We had learned in time that they had planned to exterminate us to expand their own numbers, but as to why they chose to exterminate us to do so is unknown.What's even stranger, was that their attacks had grown weaker and weaker, as if their own numbers were dwindling, even more so than the ones that had died attacking our fleet and colonies.we drew them back rapidly, capturing their colonies one by one.Some had been captured by force, yet many had been deserted, or dying, as if an unknown force had decimated their populace.&#x200B;

The Drones were launched, and the weapons had been charged up.The military defenses of the planet were easily overtaken, almost too easily.Before long, we had made planetfall, and had the rest of the population had quickly surrendered.We had went down to the planet, in specialized spacesuits, that were equipped with Biohazard protection, as well as the usual atmospheric and combat protections.Strangely, instead of a mighty force as we had expected, we came face to face with a race of rather sickly looking creatures.Compared to the bodies we had examined over 40 years prior, they were mostly emaciated, and had signs of disease, as if a plague had hit the planet.We interrogated of one of their generals, who had called himself "Quetsel".He claimed that they had attacked us, and that they would die if we were not exterminated.He then claimed that the universe was over capacity.He had then compared us to Hyzal, which we learned were a small creature native to their planet, about the size of an earth Rat.They also breed quickly, like our rats.Sergeant Ryan Jones, who was one of our interrogators then punched Quetsel, after which Jones was quickly escorted from the room.&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Much deliberation as to what to do with the rest of the population.Some advocated for extermination, "NO mercy!"was shouted my many people.Others had sought to spare the Ceros, which we learned is what the aliens called themselves as a species.Eventually, we had decided to do the latter, yet , we decided to keep an occupation force on the planet, and to try to see about eradicating the plague, which we had worried would mutate and take our own people out.A program had been launched to scale back the numbers of Hyzal, which had been identified as the source of the plague.In the time since we captured Accoursi, the Ceros population, and our own populations had stabilized, mostly due to the reduced desire to expand our own numbers, and due to wars  between ourselves, as well as alien rebel groups raging on unsanctioned, outlying colonies.Apparently some of us were still fighting.
