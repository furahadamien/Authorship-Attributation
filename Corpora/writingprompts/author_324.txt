My parents had been surprised, at first, when they realized I could speak Spanish to my nanny as well as I could speak English."She must have a gift," said my mom.My Dad wasn't as pleased.He thought I was being influenced too much by Mrs. Reyes and promptly let her go.Since then, I had always taken it for granted that I automatically spoke to the gardener and the cashier in Spanish.My Mom was impressed that I had retained so much from my toddler years.We had learned not talk about it with Dad.In high school, I decided to take Spanish as an easy elective, but I found that I couldn't even remember how to say "How are you?"when I was with my teach, Mrs. Nelson.She was tall with a severely cut white-blonde bob and seemed to hand out C's and D's gleefully.She had learned Spanish as a missionary in Guatemala, and a part of me felt like she was saying it all wrong.Who would have been able to catch her faking it in this town?Just about everyone was the same here: white and English speaking.Another part of me knew that she couldn't have gotten licensed to teach Spanish if she didn't speak it, which lead to a weirder question: why couldn't I remember a single word when I was around her?Things started to get a lot weirder when I took my Spanish homework to our gardener, Carlos, for help.He seemed puzzled when I handed him my worksheet and asked for help."Oh Jessie," he said "It's been so long since I took Spanish I don't think I can help."I didn't know what to say for a few seconds.We were *speaking* in Spanish.Weren't we?I knew we weren't speaking English."Ummm..." I stammered "What language are we speaking then?"Carlos started laughing."How can you not know what language we're speaking?I'm from the Philippines , Jess, I speak Tagalog.How did you learn it if you don't even know what it's called?"That was the questions I started asking myself over and over again.I started to stitch together a weak, but plausible answer.Carlos had been the gardener since I was six.I must have just learned it from him.A Google search told me that the vocabulary was influenced by English and Spanish.I must have been able to understand enough of the words to just guess the rest in the beginning and eventually I learned the rest by practicing.Our town was small and monolingual enough that I almost could have gotten through high school without realizing if it hadn't been for Selim, the Turkish exchange student.When I automatically started speaking Turkish with him, I stopped making excuses.There was something going on that was really weird, and if there was one thing I didn't want to be in high school, it was weird.So I dropped out of Spanish and started avoiding Selim.I even started coming into my house through a different door so I didn't run into Carlos in the garden.I was able to easily avoid speaking anything but English, until the Saturday my Dad took me to McDonalds.It was a strange thing for him to do.He rarely showed any interest in me and he openly despised fast food.I thought we were going to just go through the drive through, but instead he parked and we walked inside.As soon as I got inside I noticed one of the cashiers.She looked about six feet tall, for one thing, but there was another thing about her that I couldn't quite figure out.For some reason I just wanted to stare.When it came time to order my Dad ordered a double cheeseburger and an extra large soda.Another time, I would have been questioning when my dad started eating burgers or drinking soda.However, the tall girl was the one taking our order, and I was having a hard time paying attention to anything but her.I realized both the girl and my Dad were staring at me, waiting."Umm.... can I get fries?"Is what I meant to say, but what came out of my mouth was something else entirely.It sounded more like a series of grunts and clicks than a language."Stop goofing around Jessica!"my Dad said."There are people waiting."But it was the girl's reaction that scared me.Her happy how-can-I-help-you face had turned into something else entirely.She glared at me intensely, eyebrows furrowed, lips pulled down into an angry frown."Can I get fries," I tried to whisper but the strange sounds came out of my mouth again.I turned to my Dad, "Can you order the fries for me," I said "I need to go to the bathroom."He seemed too dumbstruck to be angry, so I power-walked from the line to the restroom, where I found an open stall and sat.What had just happened?And why had that girl been angry about it?I couldn't sit in the bathroom forever, so eventually I got up, went to the sink, and started washing my hands.I looked in the mirror, and I realized I wasn't alone.That girl was standing in the corner staring at me.We both stood in silence while I continued to wash my hands.Was I supposed to break the silence?What was she doing here?"What are you doing here?"She finally said, in English."My Dad brought me," I said, but of course it came out in more clicks and grunts."Stop, please.""I can't"

She just stared for a few seconds.I couldn't tell if she was angry or confused."I'm sorry I don't know what is happening, I can't control it."I added

"Just speak English, they have spies everywhere," she paused before adding,  "unless you are a spy.""I'm not!"I interjected quickly "I don't even know what's going on.I've never told anyone this before, but I just speak other languages, I guess, I mean...I don't know anything about it.""That's hard to believe," she said "But, on the other hand.You aren't one of us.You're too small, for one thing.Just, please, don't come here again if you are going to speak The Language.""What language?What language are we speaking?"I asked

"If you really don't know I can't tell you.But you put both of us in danger when you speak it.Don't come back here.Get your Dad and go."She left the bathroom and I went and explained to my Dad that I wasn't feeling well and needed to go home as soon as possible.After the antics I had pulled in the line, he wasn't too happy with me, but he was happy to get me out of McDonalds.Some people had heard me and were staring.As we got into the car I realized that I needed to go back.I needed to speak with that girl again and find out why she couldn't be heard speaking her language.Mostly, though I wanted to figure out how I knew it, how I seemed to know every language, and how I could make it all stop.
