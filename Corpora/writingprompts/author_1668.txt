Chicken Soup!Dont tell me youre making the chicken soup...I gave you the cookbook because you were the least likely to use it!

  Grandma, you died!what the f*@# are you doing here?!

I dont know, you summoned me!Try making the gnocchi, that sends me back.

  But, what?but dad said the family business killed you.

Thats true

 He knew!?

He caught me on the job once, bit awkward, but that priest had it coming, couldnt wait until the afterlife.

  So what were you doing here?A demon pretending to have a family.

Dont get high and mighty with me, its called a fucking sabbatical.

  A sabbatical?!

You try torturing people for thousands of years, then the 20th century kicks off and everything changes, nothing works anymore, its all saw that on game of thrones I needed a break, I needed to understand the way of things.Farmers, peasants, feudal lords, theyre easy.A modern teenager with FortniteBR?Different kettle of fish.

  How did you even have kids

Oh so f-ing god can screw the virgin mary and start a while religion while on a weekend binge but I cant have a family while on sabbatical?

  Well I suppose when you put it like that.

I was only meant to be away a few years, then one thing lead to another, I end up with ungrateful grandkids and a huge bill from finance.

  For being late for work?

No for returning a rental human body that had 94years on the clock!The dealership wasnt happy.So where are we with that gnocchi?

  Oh yeah forgot about that... Ill get started.

Dont tell your folks, your dad always was overly sentimental.

  Ok, I wont

And Ill check in on you in 10yrs for your first day of work.Let you know whos who

  Thanks, wait, in 10years, when Im 32?

Yeah enjoy yourself!You get shafted real good

  What!Tell me what happens.

No deal, looks like Im making gnocchi myself doesnt it...

End.
