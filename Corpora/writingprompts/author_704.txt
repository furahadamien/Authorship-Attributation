Check.Check.Check.Chec- oh wait I should leave that person alone since he's the leading cause of the planet's doom.I make a mental note of the targets I have to kill today and store my list back into my pocket.In the dark of night, I go back to hunting people worthy for survival in the city.People who didn't deserve to die to the wretched plans of the leaders in this world.2055.That's the deadline.40 years since geologists have projected there will be reversible effects, yet no one bothered to listen.The sky is overcast with clouds made from dust and pollution, like always.My footsteps are silent, and I hide behind obstacles to make sure I am hidden.It will be hard to see anyone in the dark but I have long gotten used to moving like this at night.After all, quick deaths are not always peaceful deaths.I hid behind the wall, listening to the sounds of footsteps.Two young ones, one adult.Exhaustion can be seen in their eyes.Most likely refugees moving to a more habitable place to live.Even in the dead of night, she watches around vigilant for anyone nearby.After confirming no one here, she's brings out a commonplace item 40 years back - bottled water.She lets both of them drink their fill of the water, and then takes the bottle back.Although a quarter left remains in the bottle, she paused for a while before reluctantly takes a sip herself, and then quickly put the bottle of water away.My dagger slips from my sleeve and onto my hand.After a bit of waiting for their guard to drop, I approach them from behind.It's a little complicated with young ones, so I have to make sure they go with their parents.However, I long have grown accustomed to ambushing.&#x200B;

They weren't my targets, but it was enough to see family dynamics.I've seen worse.Blood ties could mean nothing when survival was at stake, but thankfully I won't let that kind of world happen in the next one.Just another two districts remain.It's going to be a long night.&#x200B;

The next morning, the radio in the city went off.There was murmuring, but no panic."Have you heard?It turns out it's Another 5,000 deaths today.The mark of the cut shows it's that same serial killer.""Only that monster can make those knife strokes and leave behind that pattern.""I'm glad I didn't die.At least it means this district is safe now.Better them than me, haha.Now the living houses here should skyrocket in price.I should buy their houses before others do.""The leaders aren't even making a move on this killer either.They say less people means more food.Bah, I bet they say that because they were never the target of the killer.""How are you so sure the killer isn't sent by the leaders?What ordinary human can wipe out a mass number of population so efficiently every day without being caught by the numerous security cameras here?"I continued walking down the street, ignoring the murmurs and preparing to finally leave the city for good.I rubbed the heavy bags under my eyes.Indeed.I only hunt once in a district.There's no need to cull them and it reaffirmed my thoughts after hearing the way they speak.All the wild animals have been culled or eaten.The only ones remaining are livestock.In the beginning of my assassinations I would have frowned from hearing such talk, but now it's much simpler to keep my poker face.After all, killing every night until I'm numb physically is very taxing.I make my way out of the city and to the final 'town' left.The refugees that aren't allowed inside the town - roughly 300, are the ones who migrated with the 'townsfolk' only to stab them in the back.They sit outside with the trash and bemoaned at the injustice of it all.Of course, they have no one to blame but themselves.They betrayed the townsfolk to get extra provisions only to be betrayed by the leaders when they didn't account for giving them living space at the base.The town itself should number up to 2000.They are the ones ostracized by the leaders in the city.They are also the geologists who set up this small but habitable town and all they wanted was some peace and quiet before their inevitable doom.There aren't much left, but since this is the last habitable base, I'll be done after finishing up today.I opened my eyes to see myself on the grassland.The sun is shining.A warm breeze blew overhead.I made it.The dagger that has been with me the entire 14 years has started to dissipate into blue specks of light.That's right - it was temporary.It was something that being had given to me, but since it wasn't needed on this world, it's job is done here."Thank you for everything... partner," I whispered.&#x200B;

"Hey, you there!You're the one who sent us here right?"I turned my head around.Before me are all the townsfolk.Behind them was the number of people I killed within my 14 years in the other world and a slightly modernized farmland.I nodded."A killer?More like a saviour!""Thank you so much!""I didn't know it was you who was sending us here.I should have realized it since i transported here after greeting you.""Thank you for the painless transportation."Indeed, the townsfolk were one of the few who I openly slaughtered in daylight without fear of cameras.There was no panic in their eyes of course, everyone was going to meet their end eventually.The townsfolk has already been betrayed once, so they had no fear in their eyes.It was only shortening their death slightly ahead of time.In fact, they rather felt dying a quick death is much better than death by starvation or death by poisonous water.However, they never expected the so-called killer was actually bringing hope rather than despair.They hugged me, they cheered, and they lifted me up to meet the many others who I sent ahead of time.A rice field, vegetable fields, domestication of animals, everything is restarting.Human civilization is beginning anew.But this time, with the world experiencing the closeness of death, the people will not make the same mistake again.Then sun is shining.A warm breeze blew overhead.I smiled brightly for the first time in 14 years.&#x200B;
