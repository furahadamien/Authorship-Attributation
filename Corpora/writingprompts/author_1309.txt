and thats why I think its just not the right thing to do.Sure the penguins are cute, but do we really need them around to survive. Sarah lectured, sitting across the table from Hector Wellington, a suave, twenty-five year old man, single, trying his very hardest to change that fact.Oh really?Thats a rather  unique view on the survival of an entire species. Hector replied, feeling a bead of sweat trickle down his neck.It looked like Hector had gotten himself into another doozy of a dating situation again.Thank you! Sara said, ecstatic, a big grin on her face and her eyes popping open in pleasure.Its nice to finally meet someone who understands me.You wouldnt believe all the weirdos out there who just scoff at my penguin sustainability plan.You see, the thing is  

Sarah continued to drone on, ranting about this and that, waving her arms and spouting inane conspiracy after inane conspiracy.Hector nodded along, grimacing, as he reached into his pants pocket.Underneath the table, Hector pulled out his phone, and began to text an old friend for help; a desperate SOS if you will.Around Hector and Sarah, a busy, rather fancy, restaurant hustled and bustled.The soft murmuring of chatter and chewing filled the air, a lovely backdrop for Sarah to drone on and on about how you can reduce carbon emissions by burning penguin carcasses with environmentally friendly coal.Really, it shouldnt have been any surprise to Hector; Saras father was a rather eccentric coal baron after all.With thumbs clicking desperately, Hector Wellington sent off a quick message.*Help needed.Request rescue immediately.* Hector gulped, and sent the message.Pocketing his phone, Hector brought his elbows up to the table, and clasped his hands together.And then the feathers can be used as

Heather, please! Hector exclaimed, cutting Sarah off.Um, excuse me? Sarah asked, a look of disdain and hurt on her face.Oh, sorry; Brittany.Listen, its been fun, but I really need to be going. Hector said, rising up from the table, his food and drink almost untouched, a bit of a waste, but that was life.Its Sarah. Sarah replied with ice in her voice.Sure, sure. Hector replied, staring off into space.A smile spread across his lips as the sensation rolled over him.A feeling of urgency, a feeling of lightness, of emptiness, of need, filled Hectors stomach and mind and chest and body.With an open laugh, Hector ran around the restaurant, enjoying his few moments of freedom, of pure, unchained bliss and unrestricted ability, before he was taken away.Excuse me sir, but you cant  A waiter scolded, addressing Hector as the man ran around the restaurant.Hector didnt care, didnt notice.He let out a quick laugh, and closed his eyes as the weightlessness came over him.His world turned black, turned silent, turned unfeeling, as Hector felt his body float up into the air, float up into the sky, float up into the emptiness of nonexistence; a lack of existence.Just as quickly as it had come, the sensation died down.Hector felt the ground beneath his feet, the air in his lungs, and the breeze on his face.Opening his eyes, Hector looked around him.He was standing on an apartment rooftop, amidst the rising steel, concrete, and glass towers and buildings and monoliths of the city.At the edge of the rooftop, on the precipice of life and death, fall and flight, stood Heather; the woman of Hectors dreams, or at least, she had used to be.Heathers phone was held in her hand, a wedding ring was sitting upon her finger, and a scowl was sitting upon her lips.She hopped down from the edge of the ledge, and stalked over to Hector, noticing the gleeful look on her old lovers face, and his fancy dress.And what mess have I gotten you out of this time? Heather growled, facing Hector.Hector let out a small laugh, a giggle.Probably the worst date ever.This crazy girl was talking about killing all of the worlds penguins.You wouldnt believe  

Yeah whatever Hector. Heather interrupted, folding her arms in irritation.You cant keep on abusing Aphrodites curse, okay?Were adults now, we cant keep on playing these stupid little games with each other.

B-but Heather. Hector replied, a mischievous grin on his face.Youll be my one and only, forever. Hector said with mock sincerity, recalling their moment, when they were young lovers, and their confessions to each other.It was on that day, as Hector first conveyed his feelings of love to Heather, that the goddess Aphrodite blessed Heather and Hector to always appear by ones side in a time of need.That blessing, however, had turned into a curse three weeks later when Heather and Hector had broken up; at the time, the feelings had simply been puppy love, the unknowing of adolescence.Heather rolled her eyes.Shut up you jerk. She said with just a hint of a smile, pushing past Hector.Hector watched the first woman hed ever loved walk past him, towards the door leading to the rooftop.He took a step forward, and raised an arm in the air, his mouth open to speak.Ever since their curse, their blessing, their relationship had endured after all these years.Theyd become excellent friends, and despite the bickering, the teasing and joking, theyd become rather close.Hed even been a best man at Heathers wedding last year.A tear trickled down Hectors cheek, and he dropped his arm.The door slammed closed behind Heather, leaving Hector alone on the rooftop.Despite all the joking, all the goofing and false indifference, he couldnt ignore it much longer.Hector shook his head, and stared off into the skyline of the city.The wind ripped at his clothes, and ruffled his hair.That puppy love, at least for him, had matured into something more; appreciation, dependence, need.Maybe if he had told her earlier, things would have been different.But hed been too embarrassed, too nervous about what shed think after all theyd been through, to break the status quo.And now, as Hector stared out across the skyline, and felt empty and lost, just like he always did after seeing Heather wearing her wedding ring, it was too late.So much for Aphrodites blessing. Hector muttered to himself.------------------------

Expeliarmus, Expeliarmus Harry. Hermione whispered to herself as she warmed her glass pipe filled with crack-cocaine.Ron sat next to Hermione on Harrys torn, raggedy couch.His eyes were grey and lifeless.Every once in a while he could be heard muttering to himself.It seemed that his magic wand wasnt working quite right for him.It kept on backfiring spells.Harry paced the dirty room in front of him.His eyes were wild, and there were rough, purple bruises on his right forearm.The room was cluttered, and filled with trash and old takeaway food.Bottles of brown liquor and cigarette butts littered the coffee table in front of Hermione and Ron.We gotta go get Dumbledore! Harry yelled, suddenly turning towards his two friends.Ron jumped up off of the couch.His eyes unfocused.Only Dumbledore will know how to get rid of Dementors. He said.The two burst out of Harrys apartment, leaving Hermione behind on the couch.She told them to go ahead, she needed to spend time in the library to study for their next exams.She took a long drag of her pipe.Shes always busy studying. Harry said as Ron and him left the apartment building and found themselves on the street.I dont get it.I could study just as hard as her, and never be good at magic at all. Ron complained.The two shambled down the street.They were dressed in rags, and their shoes were worn thin.No Ron, youre great at magic.Just so great at magic. Harry replied absentmindedly.It was hard for him to focus on Ron.A thousand different ideas were rushing through his mind.The two stumbled into a nearby alleyway.They followed the smell of piss and alcohol until they found Dumbledore sleeping in a pile of rubbish.The homeless man was a booze fiend, and had taught Ron, Hermione, and Harry everything they knew about magic.Dumbledore.Dumbledore! Harry yelled, kicking the filthy homeless man.Dumbledore stuttered, and looked up at the two boys with bloodshot eyes.It took him a couple of moments to regain his grasp on reality.Oh, boys, boys.Its so good to see you. Dumbledore said, slowly sitting up.His hands absentmindedly rummaged through the trash surrounding him, looking for a drop of liquor hidden away somewhere in the rubbish.Dumbledore.We need a new spell!Weve gotten tired of our old one. Ron whined.Oh boys, boys, Ive got just the thing. Dumbledore replied, reaching a shaking hand into his coat pocket.He produced a small, dirty plastic bag, wrapped in saran wrap.A brown powder could be seen through the layers of plastic.But first. Dumbledore replied, batting away Ron and Harrys greedy hands.You must understand the responsibility of magic.It is not some plaything to be used willy nilly.It must be treated with respect, and only used in your greatest time of need.

Of course, of course. Harry replied, rushed.He threw forty quid at Dumbledores feet, and snatched the baggie of heroin from Dumbledores hands.Ron and Harry left Dumbledore in the alleyway, and rushed back to Harrys apartment.Hermione was passed out on the couch, busy with her studies.Harry and Ron snuck off to Harrys bedroom, and were soon trying out their newest spell, Drugseptiem Overdosis.In a matter of minutes, they were transported to the grand halls of Hogwarts, and were in a fever pitch battle with their greatest nemesis, Lord Voldemort.Harrys phone buzzed as the two were passed out.His mother, J.K. Rowling, was calling.She was writing a new book that was going to make her filthy rich, and she liked to call her son and use some of his crazy stories as inspiration for her writing.-------------------------
