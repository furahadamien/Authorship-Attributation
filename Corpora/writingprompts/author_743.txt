Oh my goodness deary may

My how pleasant is this day

Oh I wonder what I'll see

What I'll find to have my pee

Maybe something fast to chase

Ooh perhaps I'll lick a face

I don't know what is in store 

But I know that there is more

Somewhere out there is a home

A home for me to make my own

Someone somewhere for me to love

Someone somewhere to give me hugs

Someone sweet to give me treats

Someone soon I hope to meet
