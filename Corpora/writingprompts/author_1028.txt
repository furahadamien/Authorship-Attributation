Ive been traveling the world looking for someone who had survived.I mean someone had to, how else do I keep getting these cookies delivered?It's been many seasons since the collapse and they still..keep..coming.It's funny, my mom always told me that she would always have my favorite snack even if the world tore us apart.She said as her miracle child she would always spoil me because as a kid, I had some disease that now, just seems like a dream.I sometimes wonder if she is still looking out for me in the after life.Anyways there were a few times i thought i heard voices, almost like people I used to know.It's crazy how isolation works.You hear and see things you normally wouldn't.Still, I'll keep searching, until the day I eventually meet my mom again.You know call me crazy but sometimes I feel like I can see her in the distance but...it's never her...it never will be."Hey it's time to go home.""I know, let me just leave his oreos on the table.I love you sweetheart.Never forget that, I'll always be here."
