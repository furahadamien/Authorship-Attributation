"JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!", almost unintelligibly and frantically uttered by 2 of the 3 trespassers who call themselves "heroes".The other one's spirit and initial bravado has faded away, leaving barely formed words and a sense of impending doom as she stares at my marble floor, now drenched in a mixture of blood from the 3rd trespasser, along with some of theirs and a bit of my own."YOU-U SH-SHO.YOU SHO-" she begins, before I cut her off.Another one of "those days"."Yes, I obviously shot her."I begin."I gave you all exactly one chance to drop it and go home to...I don't know?Finish school?You guys seem pretty stupid to actually have charged in like you did.I saw you all through the security footage taking out my guards."My mind trails for a bit thinking about where you plan on dining for the evening.Perhaps some brinner instead and call up Josie for binging some shitty show.I take 4 steps foward.Gun.Trigger.Second body.Maybe I'll surprise her instead.A loud scream pierces my veil of conciousness and suddenly the wound I received from earlier combat pulsates.Not out of pain, mind you, but annoyance."This shit's gonna give me a migraine..." mumbled as I rub my temple with one hand and prepare to dispatch the final intruder in true poetic fashion by bashing her brains in for causing my discomfort with a piece of debris from earlier."I was going to ask if they were sent by anyone but I guess I'll find that out soon enough anyways, right?It'll be quite the surprise."As she pleads for her life in vain, and the concrete smashes her skull, sending pieces of skull, skin, brain tissue, hair and an eyeball, I felt it hit me.I hate surprises.Recooked pasta it is.
