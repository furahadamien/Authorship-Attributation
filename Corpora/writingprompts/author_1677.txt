PART 1 

The trembling outlandish creature lying on Sarah's kitchen floor could not be called a he or a she.Despite its mesomorphic figure and size almost twice that of a human, it had, at least to Sarah's eyes a sort of *sheness* about it; the shape of its body, the way it moved when getting on its feet and the pitch of its voice when it screamed in panic and terror: ''How?How were you able to summon me?''The creature, She, was looking at this other living thing it shared a space with.Where She was covered in thick layer of impenetrable scales of different hues of green; Sarah was covered in a thin and soft layer of skin; where She had think and sharp horns, Sarah had velvety and voluminous hair; where She had hoofs and claws; Sarah had feet and nails; where She was muscular, Sarah was weak; She was big; Sarah was small; She was from one world; Sara from another; She a daemon; Sarah a human.She's world was filled with myths and magic, and with stories of small and squishy gremlins of different colors, who call themselves humans, and had the power of uttering nonsensical words and violently dragging one into their universe.However, She always thought that the gremlin stories were gibberish old daemons told the young ones to scare them.Although She witnessed many examples that the human world would consider illogical and supernatural, She never met anyone who went to the world of small gremlins.The fact that she never talked to someone who went to the humans sent even more fear into her strong bones - no one ever came back.Meeting humans brought shame with it, so maybe it was just the case no one talked about it.This idea brought at least a bit of peace to her tormented thoughts.Sarah and She behaved as two beasts in a cage, each represented an embodiment of horror to the other.Measuring each others moves, never letting their sight rest on anything else but each other, standing very still or moving just slightly as a reaction to the others move.They equally feared each other, there seemed to be no intention to hurt each other, rather to run away.If they were not frozen by fear, and She by not knowing how the world outside the kitchen would even look, they would have already run away.When She found the courage to scream one more time *How were you able to summon me,* Sarah accepted this invitation for communication and trying to cover her fear with loud noise screamed: ''I don't know!You were supposed to be chicken soup!''''What are you going to do to me?'', She asked.''Nothing,'' Sarah replied.What was she to do to She?The late morning turned into an early evening and none moved much.The adrenaline rush of the shock was liberating their bodies from an autocracy of panic, making way for consciousness to again sit on the throne in the realms of consciousness.Gradually the strangeness of each others presence become bearable.She, in a completely alien universe with a creature in front of her that didn't seem to have the intention of hurting her, started feeling a dependency.Sarah felt responsibility as well as anxiety of what it would mean to try and seek help for what had happened.With slow and cautious moves she moved towards She, put her hand around her hand and when she noticed She was not resisting guided her room to her room on the other side of the big house.She's body barged through an interior that clearly was not for her size.''Sit or lay where ever you want.There is going to be a lot of noise and smoke now, but don't be scared, you're going to be ok.''

Without any idea of how to explain the destroyed kitchen Sarah set it on fire and immediately called the fire-fighters.She got lucky in her calculations that they would arrive before the fire had spread to other parts of the house.Once everything had been over, and her mother was worriedly hugging her, perverted thoughts were starting to cross Sarah's mind, ones where she lets the house with the daemon burn down, maybe even with herself inside.''What were you making?''Sarah's mother asked.''Chicken soup.''Sarah replied.''The one from grandma's cookbook.''''Yes.''''You are a much better cook than me, I mean when you don't burn down kitchens.The cooking skill seems to skip a generation.''The smile and humor, however, did not adequately hide the worry on her mothers face.In bed, Sarah was flipping through the handwritten cookbook.Somewhere from the middle of the book, the recipes made less and less sense; each page become more nonsensical than the previous one.The neat handwriting became erratic and messy; the clear cooking rules become meaningless words in freedom scattered around the page - syntax and pragmatics became as melted and disintegrated as ingredients of a creamy vegetable soup.In 1962 when BBC 1 featured a special about the American artist Andy Warhol's *Campbell's Soup Cans* Sarah and She had already been in their secret and troubled cohabitation for three years.She lived in Sarah's room, would come out when her mother was at work, which was most of the time.Sarah and She almost never talked or look at each other, but understood each others behavior.Their life together became such a familiar and comfortable thing that they stopped questioning it.However, She would often keep Sarah up at night with her loud breathing and sudden moves.Sarah would take She often for walks during the night; they would watch tv, read books, do Sarah's university work, cook and clean the house together.However, Sarah would at times also yell at She - told her that she hates her, that she should just die or go where she came from.However, She never got mad and never left.Where would She even go?What made the cohabitation functional was that She did not need to eat and her big body become agile in moving around the house and hiding from sight.She's favorite trick was to jump and attach herself to the ceiling.Sarah also had the sensation that nobody else could see She, as there were moments when She would run out of side to slow, yet nobody seemed to catch even a glimpse of her.Sarah and She got so confident in She's skills that She would sometimes spend evenings attached to the living room or kitchen ceiling passively watching TV or idly listening to conversations.On one of the occasions when Sarah started telling She how she hates her She's reaction changed.She slapped her with her clawed hands deeply bruising Sarah's body leaving Sarah bleeding on the floor.As the paramedics were taking Sarah to the hospital, her mother worryingly followed.Then, right next to the ambulance truck she saw She.The mother saw the glory of her majestic figure, the scales dazzling under the moonlight, the horns shining and the sharp claws menacingly clicking one against the other.Others seem not to have noticed or did not care.Sarah's mother showed no fear or surprise, not even when the daemon jumped on the ambulance truck, not when it stayed with Sarah in the hospital room nor when it came back home.
