"Wait what?How dafuq did you get here?""Long story, lemme show you around."I see his palace, his rooms (he even offers me one); but one thought annoyed the hell outta me: This King looks drunk all the time, how did he become the King?I meet a minister and uncontrollably ask him "How the hell did this guy become the King?""What doth thee cullionly?", he asks."Oh boy, this is gonna be harder than I thought."I go to the King again, and ask "How do you communicate with these people?""Communi-what?""Talk.How do you talk to these people?""Bro, I am a spotboy at one of Shake-peer's plays.""Shakespeare"
"You want me to shake us a beer?They don't have those here.""Boy, this is gonna be way harder than I thought."Since I can't take more of this dumb shit anymore, I run back to my time machine to go back to the future.As I approach it, I see two guards playing with it.I try to stop them, but one of them manages to activate it, and I see it disappearing before my eyes.For a moment I thought I was screwed, until it hit me; I mean, the second hits me with his spear, and takes me back to the King.I wake up in the King's chamber."It's a good thing I saw you, they were gonna kill you.Here, have a drink.""Thanks, I guess.Now tell me.How did you get here?""What do I tell you.Around 5 years ago, I was high on weed man.I was in the basement of the theatre I work at, when I heard some beeps through the wall.I broke the wall and found this cubicle and went into that and poof I come here.These guys saw my smartphone and thought it was some killing machine.I still mention it to scare them although its battery drained years ago.""Wow!And where must I find this cubicle?"The King takes me to his basement, where he shows me the time machine and guess what - it was the same time machine I had constructed.I gladly hop into it and go back to the future, only to find out it the future has been ruined.I need to prevent the drunk dude from becoming the King.The best way I can think of, is to stop myself from creating a time machine.I go to my house, only to get the shock of my life (at least the life of this timeline) - I am no longer a scientist, I am a stoned guy who works at a Shakespearean play as a spotboy.Now since all of you have figured out what exactly has happened, I decide to end this mindless loop - by killing myself.I grab a knife and about to stab myself, when suddenly, a third version of me appears and shoots both of us with a gun.
