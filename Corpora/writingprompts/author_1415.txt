"It had all been so easy.They say that power corrupts.It's not true.Power makes you blind.The more powerful you become, the less easy it is to see."Once upon a time, I was a friend to mortals.My duty was simple - allow souls to move on from their every aging cages.For the soul is immortal, but I am mortality itself.I am death."Mortals once lived for many years unhindered by my hand.They moved on easily, only dying when it was their time.I realise my folly now.I created ever more creative ways to kill."The fire of my inspiration was only stoked by human nature itself.Such infinite potential, such incredible ingenuity...They were the catalyst for even greater disasters."I should have seen it when I released pestilence upon the world.I killed half of the world easily and I watched in glee."The Black Death", they called me.I retained that name as a badge of honour."Even as the years droned endlessly on, wars of immense scale pushing at the boundaries of life, evil people with evil intent killing at their own will, egged on by none other than Death himself...I could have stopped then."But then I saw it.The next level of human ingenuity.I was intrigued.More than that - I was inspired.They created the means of their own mass suicide.They called it 'the atomic bomb'.I called it 'my great triumph'."I caused the minds of men to throw away their thoughts of peace, to continue on building and improving these weapons of mass destruction.I did not have the power, though, to cause them to actually kill.What was it the humans say... 'You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink'?Yes, it is true.I can lead humans towards opportunities to kill, but it has always been my way to allow humans to be the ones to do it.I never saw myself as responsible.I did not pull the trigger.I only loaded the ammunition and watched as they fired."But it was that fateful day when my great triumph was released into the world.As they went up, I laughed.Surely, my plan would be complete.I would kill every human, and surely I would rest."But as they came down, my own incorporeal body ached.Then it stung.Then, I was hit by an unbearable pain."I killed most of you that day.I did not realise it until it happened, but I relied upon you.My strength, my own essence, relied on the humans that still lived upon this Earth.If you were to die, I too would die as the last soul departed this Earth for the heavens."The last human sat by the fire, with death beside her.She had a gaping hole in her belly from a sharp object going in, which had gone about rupturing many organs.Her wound was infected, and her body ailed beyond help.The power death had over pestilence had worn out.Now, nature ran itself.As the barely conscious woman brought herself to look at the pitiful being in front of her, one that had been watching over her family and the last remnants of humanity for nearly three hundred years since the beginning of this mess, he looked upon her as well."It's alright, I understand.I know your feelings of betrayal.I caused this.It is my fault.You should not have had to die for that.Not you, not your brother, not your father or your mother... Do you still remember their faces?"The woman closed her eyes, and slowly nodded.Death sighed."All of my existence, I felt that my calling was to cause death.Maybe it is time for me to meet my maker.I doubt he will be kind."Startled by a hand on his shoulder, he looked around to see the woman, standing with blood running slowly and thickly from her belly, leaning to one side, clinging to life by a thread."You... Will be defended.How many lives... Have you saved?"Death looked down once again."Perhaps my lesson is that I have saved none.This last three centuries has been my lesson - I am not Life, I am not Death...I am futility."As the woman fell down once more, she began to close her eyes, one last sentence slipping from her lips."You are life to me..."

The life force in her body was drained.Death looked up at the heavens above, tears running down his bony cheeks.As he took a final look at the world he had created, he smiled a sad smile."So it did not matter.It is ended."The last human soul was taken to the heavens.The bringer of death lay on the ground also, the force of his life bleeding out.Those last words echoed in Death's mind."*You are life to me...*"
