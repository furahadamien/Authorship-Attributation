"What shape?"Captain Mel Chilis, commanding officer of the H.M.S.Stank Bush, stroked his half bearded face and pondered for several seconds before answering."What do their dicks look like?"He asked sternly."Basic cylindrical shape with a bit more bulge at the end.I anticipated a standard first contact scenario and have already plotted the orbital insertion."Lieutenant Becky McDonalds said briskly with a sense of pride.Jack TimHortons, the ship's navigator, chuckled softly to himself and turned to Becky."Perhaps we should try a non standard approach."He said."What do you have in mind?"Captain Chilis asked.The captain was always ready to hear out his junior officers."How about we send the new satellites?They can produce ten times the delta V, Captain.Do you have any idea how much we can make them move with that kind of propulsion capacity?!"Captain Chilis' eyes went wide."My God...Lieutenant Mcdonalds, please model an orbital insertion and account for a waving pattern.Let's say 30 degrees from the base"
"Calculating now... nominal sir!The new satellites will be able to complete 74 hours of orbital maneuvers before reaching bingo fuel."Becky said excitedly."Good job!Input the flight plan."Captain Chilis said.He reached to his console to activate the internal communications system."Commander OliveGarden, prepare the new satellites for launch.""Aye aye captain!"Commander OliveGarden replied from the launch bay."We'll be ready to launch in 12 minutes, sir.""Fine.Lieutenant?""Currently modeled to launch in 9 minutes!"Becky said hurriedly.The captains eyes went wide and immediately went back to the internal communications system."Lieutenant Commander KentuckyFriedChicken, get down to the launch bay NOW and speed things up.We need to launch in 9 minutes!""Commander OliveGarden, you have 9 minutes to launch!KentuckyFriedChicken is coming to assist.""Aye captain, we'll get it done!"OliveGarden responded."Mr. TimHortons, we need to buy them some time.Options?""I'll adjust our orbit and velocity outward to intersect the launch point.McDonalds, how far before apoapsis on current path is launch?""319 seconds!"Becky replied immediately."Make it so, TimHortons.As usual, you're just what we need."TimHortons made the adjustments and prepared to lay in the new orbit."We will reach the launch point in 10 minutes 33 seconds after the burn... but sir, the new path will run us into the upper atmosphere."Brave Captain Chilis looked to his crew.First to Lieutenant McDonalds, rapidly working her console.To Ensign Subway at the sensor console.To Sergeant McDonalds.To Warrant Officer 5 Guys.To Ensign McDonalds, and finally to Mr. TimHortons.They all waited for the command they all already new he would give."Make it so."The Captain ordered.The crew returned to their duties.The Captain trusted his bridge crew and they trusted him.The minutes counted down."Time until insertion?"The captain asked
"60 seconds."Lieutenant McDonalds said."Bridge, Launch Bay.Commander Olive Garden here.We are ready to launch!"The captain slapped the console victoriously."Phenomenal work OliveGarden.Tell KentuckyFriedChicken and Private McDonalds to clear the bay and watch for an amazing show!""Aye captain!"The captain reveled for a short time.'My god' he thought 'we might actually pull this off.'"10 seconds."Becky said
"We're about to make history."TimHortons said quietly.The probes flew for the H.M.S.Stank Bush, clustered tightly together for their initial burn to place them into a stable, circular orbit.After only a few seconds, their orbital engines stopped and they began to spread apart.Their fusion generators, normally covered by thick plating, were the most important part of each tiny vessel.A small door opened revealing the reaction, suspended in magnetic fields.The reaction, small as it was, was so powerful that it was visible even from a great distance away.The Chinkokos had just discovered flight.Their largest city was abuzz all day long regarding this amazing feat.As nightfall came, every child and parent, brother and sister, husband and shmeklok, went to the ancestral river to rejoice.Their news papers and radio commentators were speaking of the future all day."What will come?""Will we keep going higher?""Are there others out there who have achieved what we have achieved?"So many questions.So few answers.As they gathered and began feasting, a small child pointed to the sky and screamed aloud in fear.The crowds across the city looked upwards to the sky to witness what could never be unwitnessed.Dozens of bright lights spread out across the sky, expanding from each other... into the shape of a dick!As the massive dick flew across the sky, it waved back and forth.Several lights beneath it formed the first 5 prime numbers.The mathematically inclined members of the crowds shouted in amazement and bewilderment.The dick flew south across the horizon as a red stretch of light moved away in a similar direction.The Chinkokos no longer celebrated and began discussing the aliens above."What... what did the lights mean?""Why did they form a dick?""Is that how they say hi?""Who the fuck are these guys?"The H.M.S.Stank Bush hit the upper atmosphere hard.Her hull began to heat up as a long, superheated trail of atmosphere was left behind her."Mr. TimHortons, what's our trajectory?""Periapsis is 600 kilometers and dropping 10 kilometers a second.Full burn 90 degrees to horizon and we'll clear the atmosphere in 20 seconds or so.""50 degrees.We don't want to belly flop into the atmosphere."The captain ordered.The Stank Bush's powerful sub-light engines ignited and launched her forward, fighting against the friction.She slowly regained altitude and, steadily, velocity.Soon, she was out of the atmosphere."The probes... did they make it?"The captain asked Becky McDonalds.The whole crew went immediately silent."They made it!"She said after what seemed an eternity."On screen!"The sight of the massive waving dick filled the wrap around viewscreen.The entirety of the crew tuned to their screens or found a window that happened to look in the right direction."We did it."TimHortons said."We did.Another successful first contact."Captain Chilis sat back in his chair and leaned back, breathing out as though he'd been holding his breath for hours as the crew around him launched to their feet and began cheering.First contacts aren't easy.They are fraught with unexpected dangers that require steely determination and ingenuity.Follow the adventures of the H.M.S.Stank Bush and her crew as they traverse the universe, seeking out new civilizations, and showing them what we're all about!
