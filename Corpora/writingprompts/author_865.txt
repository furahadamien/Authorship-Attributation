Who the hell picked the codenames for this mission? Jos AKA Jesus complained loudly from his designated post as get away driver.Stanley, who had been codenamed Satan smirked, Funny you should mention hell. 

Silvia rolled her eyes, Very funny Satan.How did I get stuck with the name Shiva?Next time Im picking the codenames.

Brandon shook his head, What I dont get is how whoever was assigning names decided I wouldve the code name Buddha.Not only am I Roman Catholic, Im also the sharpshooter!

Suddenly a stern voice cut in over the radio.For the last time, keep the radio chatter to a minimum, we dont want to get caught.

Jos looked chastised, Roger that Mohammed.

Silvia turned to look at Stanley and said, But seriously, whose turn was it to pick the code names?

Stanley chuckled, If I had to guess?Damien.

Silvia snorted, I should have fucking guessed.
