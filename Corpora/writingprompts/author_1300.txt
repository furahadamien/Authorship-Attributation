"She was found dead the next day, on such a dreary February afternoon" a chapter of my biography read, "[Biography Of: Danielle Jerhova]" read a footnote at the end .I had always wonder what happened to her, what had led such a bright soul like hers, down suck a dark path?I trudged through the library until I had found it.Her book had only 27 chapters, as she had died at 16 from an undisclosed cause, but the news of her death spread like wildfire through the school, thus she was in my Section 16.I had found her biography and flipped to what was labeled 'Section 16', it was rather large with 5 chapters in the last year of her life.I read through chapters 1-3 each entitled 'Bitter 16th', 'Enclosure', and 'Dimmed' respectively.They had reflected in how much her parents divorce affected her mental state and her outlook on life.I flipped to chapter 4, which was entitled 'Reaching for hope' it was relatively short compared to the other chapters.It seemed like it would be about a positive time, but I would quickly regret browsing through the memoirs and explanations of the previous chapters, because this chapter had shown the abyss she was really in."I was always waiting for him, no matter how much it hurt to not see him everyday.Maybe I was invisible to him, but I tried to show myself enough without being obvious to him.I dyed my hair, I lurked outside of his classes, I wrote on his locker, I did everything in my power to get him to call me again, or at least acknowledge me.He wasn't supposed to know about the cat, I don't know if he did or not, but either way Jules was in the way of us, she deserved those tires.I wish I could tell him about daddy, but he wouldn't love me then, he'd never go out with someone who knew daddy.That night daddy texted me, 'take your pills tomorrow  honey, this will be the last batch; Love, Daddy', In the morning I took Jules to the basement and dried her up, mommy said you need someone close to give blessings.Before my last batch of pills I called Ryan 5 times, I wanted him to answer, I wanted him to tell me that what I was doing was wrong, I wanted him to tell me that I shouldn't die, I wanted him to tell me that I mattered.But he never picked up.Today the 3 on the back  turned into an 8.So I took 8, they tasted weird, my vision started to fade.When I awoke I checked my phone, there were no messages at all, had daddy deleted them?I turned to go up the stairs but I never made it, Goodnight Ryan!"This chapter was written in whole as a personal story, The last chapter explained her cause of death.She had accidentally over-dosed on her pills to stop her hallucinations and deal with her Depression & Anxiety.She had to take these pills daily to cope with the murder-suicide of her parents.I was exhausted, her biography had really taken a toll on me, maybe I should go get a glass of water to swallow these down?, after all it's not good to keep medicine in your mouth for too long.(I hope this wasn't too bad,(I struggle with pacing) it is my first story here after all <3)
