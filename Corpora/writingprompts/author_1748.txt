Im older and more wise than i used to be, though i retain my youth and future still.Im only 26.I feel old, but from the peers that surround me, i keep my youngness.There is no indubitable answer to the person i was most cruel to in the exempt of what i thought was my revenge brought upon my past friends and loves who had betrayed me.Fickle things.From that, i learned a lesson.I matured more, and realized that i should love myself and love the good people in my life.That things and people shouldn't be trusted at face value, that trust and respect are earned.Those are the people i am nicest to.There is no one direct answer.With learning to value life, i was by the side of my friend in a desperate time of his life.I helped save another whome i didn't directly care about, nor know, but he did and loved her.It was frightening, nearly phyyric for myself for no gain other than the preservation of life.Especially one that a friend loved.If ive caused death, i do not know about it.Nor do i see myself being the cause of any living person's end.I treasure my blood and I've  surrounded myself with good people.If death was due, it would have been done.
