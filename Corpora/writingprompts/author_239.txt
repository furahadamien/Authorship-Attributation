"Would you like to eat something ?""Sure"

The white syrup from the green apple flowed down zig zaggedly through his rough black beard.He took a deep breath and smiled like a glad baboon in his head,
outwards a calmness enveloped his red face as he slowly and luxuriously dug into this apple."How long has it been?""Who knows, who cares?""Where are you going to?""I'm trying to find my mom, but I'm so tired and my sense of direction is so bad, I feel like a blind man lost in the desert."They both laugh.And he laughs a little longer, mid laughter hoping she wouldn't get up and leave after the apple.They always did.She smelt so good.like all the
women he met.She smelt of kindness.And in her voice, his mind giggled at the possibilities of what lied ahead."Forget my mother, I'll come with you" he thought to himself.He wondered if she caught that.When it happened, he was driving on the freeway.A sudden fullstop.A surge of unbelievable panic, a slamming of the breaks, the screeching of tyres,
the deafening sounds of a thousand cars ramming into each other, the deafening sound of his imminent death.Then came a deep desire of wanting to cry.There were no tears, only a sense of unbelievable helplesness.That is what helplesness feels like, truly unbelievable.After he sat in the same position for what felt like a few hours to him, once the sounds of the mayhem on the road settled,
in the opening minutes of the "great blinding", Ahmed commited his first act of bravery.He moved the gear to "D" and tried to drive the car blind.As soon as the
car moved, he slammed the brakes, put it back into "P", opened the door and stepped out to only immediately jump back into the driver's seat and close the door behid
him.He turned on the ac and swept through radio channels, there were still songs playing, he touched his eye lids, he picked up his phone, it was in the cupholder, right
where he had left it, unlocked the phone, dialled a few numbers and finally got his mother.She was crying, saying she felt she had gone blind and din't know what to
do.She felt it was because she hadn't fasted last Ramadan and Ahmed suddenly remembered all the reasons for God to send him to hell.There were so many,he was certain
his mother was right.The world had ended and the good people have gone up.The scum, like himself have been left behind to be eventually picked up and thrown into
pots of boiling oil or to be skinned alive and the like.There was a relief in knowing.Being sure that he was in hell was better than being unsure about being suddenly blind on earth.He din't like where he was, but he
liked that he knew where he was.The great blinding took time to settle into the collective cognition of the world.It took a few months for the human collective to mobilize.Stories began to
circulate and slowly but steadily some stories became more repeated than the others.This was the era of "the great blinding", no one was coming to boil them in
hot oil for their sins, they had an opportunity to commit new sins.A breast to grope or a neck to slit.But they din't.Turns out killing and raping is hard when we are not sure if we will be alive.It is only when our face is pushed against the face of death we know , how badly we
want to live.He waited in anticipation, when would she get up and make an excuse to leave?Would it be the silence that was setlling in that would scare her, or was it the
thoughts in his head she would see?Were his movements too stiff?How could she be so calm and comfortable right now?like they have known each other for ages.As his mind freely swung about amidst his insecurities, a sort of resentment had begun to develop towards her.He was angry at her.What was her problem?Why couldn't she love him?Why did she make him feel so small?And wait a minute, what is happening?He blinked his eyes and looked at her again.Yes it was her.She looked great.He rubbed his eyes.He looked again.As he took a step towards his blind cleopatra, he noticed the inscriptions all around him "Don't tell them you can see".The helplesness of the first blinding enveloped him once again with the return of his sight.He continued running through the sand dunes and the words followed him everywhere " Don't tell them you can see".It was as he kept running, in the incessant flow of words and thoughts in his mind, his mind stepped down from it's mantle,
looked around all around him and laughed.He, looked up at the sky and laughed open mouthedly.And he ran back through the desert,back towards his tent, hoping she hadn't already left and as he reached he saw his
full lipped, full bummed, green apple possessing blind little cleopatra.He went up to her and asked, what is the one
thing you want most in the world right now?
