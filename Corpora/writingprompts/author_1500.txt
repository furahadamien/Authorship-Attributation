I used to make my living as a capybara herder.It wasnt the most exciting job but it put grub on the table and then some.Most people dont know about capybara herding.Thats because most people dont know about the small circles of people that treasure capybara milk and fur.The milk of the worlds largest rodent is believed to be a bonafide aphrodisiac of magnum proportions in some Eastern countries.The fur is manufactured into a pillowcase that is coveted by an emerging group of individuals braving the biting temperatures of the North.Between these two products, capybara herding was turning me into a millionaire.Another thing that most people dont know is that capybaras have a vicious bite.Although they enjoy the distinguished lifestyle of vegetarianism, they got some real chompers from evolving to the point of where they beat down grass into a pulp in their mouths.Capybaras generally have a pleasant disposition but if you catch them during a bad moodwellyou really better watch out.I wasnt watching out.Ralph was the alpha capybara in my herd.If he didnt like my herding technique, my efforts were all but hopeless.If I nodded to move East, but Ralph didnt like that, he would nod to the West and the herd would move to the West.What a dick.It was a constant power struggle to lead the herd between me and Ralph.I couldnt just get rid of him though, he was the alpha, he kept the herd together.Ralph and I constantly butted heads but one day it went too far.We had to cross the river.There was no other way, if we didnt we wouldnt make it in time for the next milk shipment.The nearest bridge across the river was damn near 50 miles South.I gestured to the herd to move across the river with a pointed finger, all the while anxiously looking over at Ralphs reaction.As soon as my hand was perpendicular to my body and pointing to the other side of the river I saw the flicker of malicious intent in his soulless giant rat eyes.And then he jumped at me.In a comic book type encapsulated moment my arm was being ripped from my body with blood flowing in all directions.I have relived this moment so many times throughout my life and every time Im there, I see, almost as if time was suspended, the force of Ralphs choppers ripping my arm from my body as if he was tearing a damp Kleenex in half.My arm was gone and Ralph is standing over my body with what was part of me clasped in his toothy grip.Im fading out.Everything goes black.6 months in the hospital.I am alive.I am miraculously	alive.I am missing an arm and cry like a child.A piece of me was stolen and I intend to get my revenge.I plan how I will murder Ralph.But then my apprentice Capybara herder comes in.His grief is great and I can tell that he really is devastated by the result of Ralphs destruction.I tell him that I will avenge myself and destroy Ralph.He tells me that Ralph was put down shortly after he bit off my arm.I am devastated.Ralph is dead.2 years go by.I feel as if my arm is there everyday.But it is not.2 years go by and I feel as if Ralph is there, his malice as keen as ever.But he is not.Both my arm and my nemesis are gone.A phantom taking a phantom limb.A phantom taking a phantom limb.A phantom taking a phantom limb.What a dick.Another 5 years go by.I am released from my hospital.I was kept longer than needed because of my psychotic obsession with a rodent.They had transferred me from medical to psychiatric.I deserve to be angry at the capybara who took my arm.He knew what he was doing.It was not animalistic instinct.I exit the hospital and close my eyes.I havent felt fresh air against my body in so long.I feel it against the arm that Ralph took from me.I open my eyes and there he is.Looking straight at me is Ralph, that rodent bastard.In an instant he overpowers me.Im on the ground with the rat son of a bitch on top of me, gnawing at my face going for the kill.It takes me everything I have with my one real arm to hold that piece of shit back from gnawing at my face.I say real because the doctors have educated me that Ralph took my left arm and I really only have one.My dead arm flails helplessly along the side.I dont try to use it because the doctors have told me it doesnt exist and I am imagining things.Ralphs phantom chompers are inches away from my face.I will die if I dont act.I clench my phantom hand and give it a swing with the power of 1000 capybaras fording a river.Ralphs ethereal body reacts as a lego tower might react to a hammer being swung by a 200lb Swedish deadlier in a onesie.Ralph smashes into a billion pieces.I am free.
