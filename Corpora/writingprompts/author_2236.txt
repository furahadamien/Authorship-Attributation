This changes our preconceived notions on the nature of our Universe and our place in it...

Space base no.33 picked up a message on this very day, a message we estimate, based on the speed of the transmission, was sent to us from an... uncanny time, long before the beginning of any life form we have studied thus far including our own.Even more strangely, *so* close to the estimated creation of the very Universe we inhabit, that we may have to reevaluate our previous, seemingly impeccable, calculations entirely.We have been able to trace the message back to it's place of origin, which fortunately is located within the observable universe.Being the message that got to us first, it must have been *the first ever sent from this species*, however, hopefully and likely, not the last.It will take us a while to reach this planet or what remains of it, I can only hope I will be able to see it in my lifetime.A species so ancient may contain secrets we cannot even fathom, having been here before the universe became what we have come to know and, to a degree, understand.Along our path to find answers, the formation of our society, our values, our habits, we may have unknowingly followed in their footsteps.As such, what we find on this planet may give us information on more than just the nature of the universe, but also the nature of all the species that have inhabited it, do , and *will forever more*.Through them, we may come to know more about ourselves, *learn* things we never even considered needed to be given any thought, *answer* questions we never even got the chance to ask...It should be noted, that based on the origin of the message it is unlikely, *nay,* **Impossible**, for them to still exist, which should be for the best, as, if we are to believe what applies to our species applied to them as well, even the smallest bias would dilute the truth, or even misshape it entirely.Steady progress is being made in decrypting  the message.From what we can understand now, it is mostly comprised of units that can take two possible values, either positive or negative, yes or no, nothing or one thing, 0 or 1...There is also a simplistic design of what we assume to be, based on recorded similarities to our ancestors, their shape.Something akin to a double helix seems visible, which can be nothing but the structure of the nucleic acid that makes them up, a primitive version of our own quadruple helix structured nucleic acid.Just below are 9 structures seemingly floating around a larger structure, which , based on knowledge we have from the star systems we have observed, our own included, can be nothing but their own star system at the time of the conception of this message.And lastly, a depiction of the device which launched the message itself, as it is too similar to a tool our species used eons ago to produce similar signals.The entire message, seems to be an introduction.*Something* that is so simplistic, yet manages to convey much more than it lets on.A person (representing, in a way, their entire species) which states their name ( represented by the depiction of the average human and their molecular structure which identifies them), their home (represented by their star system) , and the place whence the message is sent ( represented by the satellite dish).*Something* which would even seem counterintuitive.Sending a message that you *know* will receive no answer in your lifetime or even your planet's, yet only providing so little information, *as if trying to initiate a simple conversation with a possible friend*, as if trying to reach on to someone in an endearing, childlike manner.*Something* that I feel we can relate too.Both in it's seeming lack of logic or reason, and in it's endearing, almost desperate, benevolent and innocent nature.*Something* that makes me want to respond in kind, a response I am currently working on compiling.In spite of the fact *you* will never reach it, in spite of the fact *I* will never get an answer back, it seems only fair to introduce myself too, it seems only fair... to accept your friendship.&#x200B;

>!The Arecibo message was a short radio message sent into space to celebrate the remodeling of the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico in 1974.It was aimed at the globular star cluster M13, about 25,000 light years from Earth.It was the first message we sent to space.!<
