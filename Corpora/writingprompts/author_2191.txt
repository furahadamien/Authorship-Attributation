Harry awakens from his feigned death, and thinks this is his chance to strike out against the Lord.Lord Voldemort strikes swift and wordless against the scarred, startled face of the former Harry Potter.A silence falls once more, deeper this time."Chosen one, was it?"he asked softly, to Neville who now stood before him."Did you believe that nonsense too, Longbottom?Like you hope to see your parents again, one day?"He smiled a terrible smile at Neville's flinching expression.Before he could answer, the Lord continued."It's not too late, you know.It's not too late to save them, from where they remain."He started to step forward."If you join me, I can help you bring them back" he claimed, growing loud and growing close.Neville looked down at Harry's lifeless corpse."All you are is death" he said levelly, with barely a quiver in his tone, dashed forth and swung the tip of his fucking sword at Voldemorts wand hand.The blade connected with the wood, and the entire scene was tastefully engulfed in a whiteness.A strangely satisfying, ambiguous white.
