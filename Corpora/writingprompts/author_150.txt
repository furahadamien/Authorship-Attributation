"Ah!"I gasp as my phone suddenly, and loudly, blares next to me, startling me out of bed.I groan, growling "I'm too fat for that kind of scare", and slowly sit on on the side of the bed, picking my phone up and tapping my code into it to unlock it.The first thing I noticed, to my surprise, was how slow it took to open.I had text messages from 20 people!Of course, that was odd...I open the official warning, and frown in confusion at it."DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON" it reads."Well, okay..." I murmur to myself, before browsing a few of my texts, wondering what they were about.I took a glance at two of them, one from my dad, one from my brother."Hey fat, look at the moon"...  that's my brother, all right."Hey, your door's locked, come look at the moon" Came dad's message.Whoops, I left it locked after my evening e621 session...I unlocked the door, and walked outside, frowning as I checked everyone's rooms- all empty."Where'd y'all go?"I grumble, walking downstairs.Thankfully, I couldn't see the moon just yet- it was out back.By now, my heart was pounding, my mind working overtime as I look to the backdoor...  and froze in shock.Outside, my family were staring into the sky, unmoving.It was cold outside, yet my brother and my dad were standing out there, in their underwear, unmoving except to breathe- phones held in their hands."Oh jeez..." I say softly.I run back upstairs, ignoring the protests of my body, and hop onto my computer.Typing in my PIN, windows began to boot, discord, steam, and even skype, opening up one by one.Each one, full of messages and notifications.I hadn't ever seen so many little red squares on discord before, and all of them involved that damned rock in the sky.I was halfway to a panic attack as I opened firefox and ran to reddit and bing, determined to find out what was wrong.All I could find were mentions of the moon!I shuddered nervously, and looked up at my windows as cloud cover cut off the moon's lights.Instantly, from the backyard, I heard the wail of my family as if they were being hurt.A shudder of terror ran through me, my body screaming at me to _Get out._  I grabbed my car keys, my backpack, my large can of water, and I mashed my trusty old battered fedora onto my head.After all, I always told people that it kept the sun out of my eyes- now, it was to keep the moon out.I snuck outside, and got into the car, quickly strapping myself in, thankful that I was so tall that I couldn't look upwards out of the windsheild.I pushed the key in, and started the car.VRRRRRRRRR came the engine, as it sputtered angrily to life.The orange late 90s explorer's lights lit up, including my old friend that read "Check Engine".I switched on the headlights, which cut into the nighttime fog in front of me.Suddenly, hands pressed against the window, sending my heart into my throat."Come look at the moon, Polaris!"cheered my mom.I'll never get the wide-eyed, _empty_ look in her eyes out of my head.Shifting the car into drive, I raced out of the driveway, heading anywhere but home.It didn't help my anxiety any to see people, everywhere.Standing in yards, sitting in their cars, getting into animalistic fights, all of them trying to get a look at the moon as it slid in and out of the clouds.Finally, I gave up on looking for a place to hide, people seemed to be out and staring at the sky _everywhere._  

Suddenly, a thought raced through my head- my grandparents, both in their 70s, had no internet in their home, and their cell phone was always off unless they were away from their house.It would be safe there, and they had guns if it came to it!My car yelled in pain as I raced onto the highway, determined to make it there as fast as I could.All over the highway were parked cars, some of them right in the middle of the road.I seemed to be the only car on the road...

...until a bright set of headlights arced towards me from behind, and quickly growing closer.I glanced at my speedometer, reading "85"."Oooohh.." I groaned to myself out loud, as I switched over to the slow lane, hoping the car would just race past.As it came up next to me, it slowed down...   moving _way_ too close as the passenger window opened.Some part of me registered what it was- a rather modern full cab truck.On the other side, a panicked woman waved at me, and because she seemed to actually show emotion, I rolled down mine a little.Over the screaming night wind and my deafening exhaust, she yelled, "I don't know what's going on, he-!"before she was cut off by who I assumed was her boyfriend."You gotta see the moon!"he bellowed, our cars smacking together as he drove even closer."Go away!"I yelled back in a panic, flooring the car and trying to steer away from him, my wheels edging onto the rumble strip.The engine screamed back at me through the broken exhaust, as I shut the window again and focused on driving.The man slammed into my car again, seemingly determined to stop me now- he had no problem keeping up in his more modern truck.Looking forwards, I saw my exit coming up, making me realize I had to somehow get away from this guy before he followed me to grandma's.With a growl, I yanked the wheel to one side, my smaller SUV struggling as it tried to shove his car aside.Then, I yanked it to the other side and slammed on the brakes, just barely making it onto the exit as I halved my speed in mere seconds.behind me, I heard a sickening crash as the heavy truck slammed into the guardrail, the loud screech of tires, followed by another crash echoing up and down the highway.As I drove past our church...I tried to hold myself back, feeling an urge to throw up, my nerves on full alert.My car was struggling, the engine shuddering as I grumbled, "Told you the chains needed fixed" to nobody in particular.Still, people were standing in their yards, along the road, and..IN THE ROAD!With a gasp, I swerve to one side to miss a couple standing in the center of the road, holding hands and staring at the sky with wide, broken grins on their face.My car tilted on two wheels for a moment, and all I could do was let out a loud, nervous laugh as it slammed back onto all fours, wrestling it back under control as I then continued on my way, climbing a steep hill.As I got closer to grandma's house, I was thankful to see that her neighborhood was a little less...   moon-staring-ey.I slowly cruised into her driveway, and shut off my car, letting it shudder to a stop.I snuck out of the car, and once I stood up, I couldn't hold it back, I emptied my stomach all over her driveway."Uuughh, this is insane..." I groan, hoping that I would wake up, that this was all some sort of dream.Quickly, I run up onto her porch, and lock its door behind me as best as it would.I carefully unlock her front door, and slip inside, locking it behind me.Sneaking into her house, I make my way to her bedroom, and sigh weakly as I see their sleeping forms in bed."Grandma!"I hiss as I shake them both awake."Heavens, what's going on?"My pap growls as he looks at the alarm clock, both of them knowing something was up by the look in my eyes."I don't know, but...   _Don't look at the moon"_ I say, yanking their curtains shut.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I like writing things, and I do loads of roleplays on discord, but I've never done one of these WPs!Also it's 4 am and I really need to be in bed but I'm doing this instead...    y-yay?
