I was turning 14 when they had taken me in the prison called the Citadel.A large fortress stationed on top of Mt.Fortuna.The prison was well-managed.All the prisoners there were aware of why we had to be there.We were considered to be flawed creations, mutants of society.Some, like me, didn't take advantage of it but a handful used their gifts to its maximum potential.No matter what we did with our gift, we were all taken in as prisoners.Most of the prisoners heavily relied on luck to live their lives outside of this prison, but in the Citadel, we were all equal.For some, it felt like a favor for them that they'd get to experience a somewhat normal life because their encounters are limited only to those that have the same gifts as they do.On the otherhand, most people, including me, just wanted to get out and live life like how we used to.All prisoners in the Citadel were under life sentences for the birthright that we were given.Since the day that we were brought in, we lived in the Citadel and would eventually die in the Citadel.That meant that the only way to get out is to escape.It seems easy considering that we all have a perfect rating in luck, but as I've mentioned before, we are ALL equal in this prison, including the one and only warden here, Lady Luck.Lady Luck is the only entity that is capable of keeping us locked in the Citadel for she herself is the embodiment of luck.The ebb and flow of luck merely depended on what she wanted to happen, and in her 200 years of being the warden, she has never let a prisoner escape alive.A lot of prisoners have tried.Some have tried climbing the great walls of the Citadel only to step on a loose brick and end up falling down the great heights of Mt.Fortuna.Some have tried to sway Lady Luck into their side so that the tides of fortune may flow with them.Some have even tried to kill Lady Luck and claim freedom for all the prisoners alike.In my 12 years in the Citadel I have made careful observations.I thoroughly plotted my escape and have planned it out for too long to fail.I made sure that I was going to get out and see the light of day.Through my keen observations I have found a small window of opportunity, the only day that Lady Luck sleeps and relies on her mortal men to keep us prisoners locked in.This is the story of how I escaped the Citadel during Friday the 13th.
