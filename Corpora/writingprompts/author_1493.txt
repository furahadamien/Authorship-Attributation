It was a miserable day.The rain was coming down like cats and dogs.My car broke down, and took my phone with it.I really hate staying outside long during bug season.Fortunately, I had just passed a hotel about a mile down the road.I figured I would stop there to call a mechanic.Bug season didn't use to extend this late into new autumn, but it had been getting worse the past few years.All the bugs were really biting me to death walking down that road.People don't generally stay outside much any more because of all of them, but I figured the worst case scenario I'd be covered by my vaxxes.Then I crossed the road.There's this old joke that my great grandfather told me, "Why did the chicken cross the road?"--to get to the other side.Nobody's ever heard of it.On the other side of the road there was this field full of green leafy plants.And I noticed, when I got across the road, the insects were a lot less furious on me.I figured it might have had something to do with this plant, so I cut off a few wet leaves with my handy Peruvian Army Knife, and stuffed them in my pockets to see if they'd be of any use later.I finally made it over to the hotel.They wouldn't let me make a call without booking a room, so I decided I'd call my dealer to print a new car for convenience's sake since I had the option of spending the night anyway.I got to my room and never really actually called him because I got this wicked intense high feeling, but it was definitely different than a mary jane kind of thing.Felt kind of like extra gravity.I went to bed.I woke up in the middle of the night and started puking.I managed to get whatever it was out of my system.I took off my clothes.They were all sweaty.I figured it was a mild bug cold that I was told my vaxxes would cover.Those insects must have taken more of a toll on me than I had thought they would.I got back in bed and went back to sleep.The next morning, the owner of the hotel came to see me.He had tubes in his nose and a hole in his neck.He talked to me by pressing a phone up to his throat."How was your experience?"he asked.I told him about my car breaking down and that I was extremely grateful for their being a hotel where I could spend the night."There's no reason to lie to me."he said.He handed me back the amount I had paid to stay the night."What are you talking about?""Here, smoke this."He handed me a joint with shitty brown weed.I decided to humor him and lit up.Almost immediately I felt like I was falling again, but without actually falling.It wasn't as intense as the night before, but I got a kind of high out of it.It didn't smell anything remotely like a dead skunk, which I found confusing at the time."Thank you," he said.He pulled the tubes out of his nose.It was kind of gross how long the tubes were.Then he put his hand to his mouth and swallowed a pill.I wish I had known what was going on.His eyes closed, and they never opened again.The police came and took away his corpse.The clerk at the hotel offered me another night's stay, with complementary shitty brown-looking mary jane, and asked me to continue to honor his memory.I had missed calling my dealer the previous night to print a new car after passing out, so I agreed, but only after being able to contact my dealer.That night I decided to light up in honor of this stranger's memory.I turned on the National News Network in my room, and there was a bit of a grand ceremony.I can't think of any other word but grand.It seems overly fancy in most contexts, but I actually think it works for the stream.I felt the gravity pulling me again after smoking.It was quite pleasant.It was definitely a short-lived high.My only thought was this is probably not any kind of mary jane, but probably something else entirely.Then I saw the words across the screen.> TRILLIONAIRE DAVIS HARRIS, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF FRODO'S ORGANIC PESTICIDES, LAST KNOWN LIVING TOBACCO SMOKER, FOUND DEAD IN HIS ESTATE'S HOTEL

I was interrupted by a phone call from my dealer.He told me that he had a freshly printed car dropped off at the hotel I was at."I watched my great grandmother die like that," he said... "She deserved it."I paid him, got off the phone with him and decided to spend another night at the hotel.I couldn't really cope with the thought of having just seen this dude die, and the lack of empathy my dealer showed for someone dying was something I had never experienced.I didn't even know there were still tobacco smokers never mind that he was the last one.I was frustrated.I lit up again.I asked my phone for information about tobacco smoking.> YOU WATCHED HIM DIE

It was every other line.What was going on?I made different query.> YOU WATCHED HIM DIE

I tried to refresh my query.Awfully disgusting pictures of tarred-looking internal organs came up.> WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD?I put out the last cigarette.
