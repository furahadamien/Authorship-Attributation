"You shot my wally!"I screamed at the man nearly twice my height."You gave your wallet a name?What are you ten?"The smoke cleared from the strange gun the man had in his hands as the wallet he had shot began to ooze black blood.The man's face was masked beneath the shadows flickering on the overhead light in the alley.It was beginning to dim.The electricity in the bulb pulsing inside it was dying."Actually, yes.I am ten."It was half true.The man clicked his tongue and then pulled a piece of paper from his pocket and began reading off it."Have no fear citizen.You may have encountered a slyph.Please step back and wait for the proper authorities to arrive...Wait, this is the wrong script," the man stuffed the paper back into his pocket and scrambled around, "I am the 'proper authority'," he said it to himself, as though I wasn't even there."First day?"I asked him."Maybe... pretty sassy for a ten year old with chin acne."He pulled out another slip of paper."You've may have encountered a slyph.Stay calm and do your best to assist the shadow officer in his duties.That's me," The man said pointing to himself.He then continued reading, "have you noticed anything strange?Any electrical spikes, children with chin acne..." The man's voice trailed off and his eyes began to lift from the paper he was reading off of to stare at me.He nervously glared at me and read the last words, "or wallets that bleed when bludgeoned, cut, torn, or are shot."I gave a howling laugh that resonated off the old brick walls of the alley."The bureau really needs to stop sending newbies."He didn't scream when I ate him, it was too quick.I swallowed him whole.Then I picked up my now dead wally that I used to bait humans and walked off.
