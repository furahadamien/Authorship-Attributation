Ok keep calm,and do something or rather I recall one of our sayings.So much information and such little application.I flew planes but not Ill never touch one again.Scientists said from scratch it would take 4,000 years of innovation to get to the mid 1400s even if population booms made it possible.The ice caps will take 45,000 to melt off.If were lucky.I must be somewhere in North America I recall star constellation and Im somehow jn the Mid West.Glacial Ice is a mile high, daily deadly ice falls off the megalithic ice sculptures.Unreal 200 foot ice sculptures Adorned the local mountain peak.I guess they dont have much to do.I saw am encampment about a quarter mile in the distance a few hundred were having some sort of dance off.Ok I may not know how to start a fire but I know how to do the floss and the macarena dance.It was an instant success I became the best dancer probably on Earth.The seinfeld dance , my secret weapon unleashed in only the fiercest dance battles.I traveled extensively for about 20-30 years amassing a large fan base and even a pet liger in the process.I had 20 wooly mammoths, I was living large much like the flinstones of my day.Dinosaurs existed, I even ran for Pangea President , we however stopped the election mid way so I could do more rain dances in the desert and stop raining dances in the places it rains too much.That fact and we discovered alcohol last week.Im liking this life a whole lot better than that bad dream.Ill probak chill out and dance a bit more then create my own religion to make more Gold.
