It if wasn't for him I don't know how my life would've turned out.He was my motivation, my muse,  the reason my life turned around.Kids give your life meaning.Something I had desperately needed when little Erised entered my world.Early on we struggled.How could I explain to a five year-old why his mother was gone and why I, a stranger, replaced her.Weeks went by and I thought we might never find connection.Until one day, hearing him cry, I picked up a book.It was a thing my mother had done to me and I suppose, her mother to her.As if written in our genetic code, stories sooth a trembling heart.I soon found out that Harry Potter was his favorite.The tales Rowling told took us both away on fantastic adventures.Away from the mounting bills, away for our dingy apartment, away from the pain.And so, we aged.I got a better job, he started school, but Harry Potter remained.It started out as a fib really.Nothing meant to cause real harm; like Santa Claus or Easter Bunny.But when a child asks with tear filled eyes if his only escape from this harsh reality is true; I assure you, you'll struggle to say no.I perpetuated that lie though.When he scraped his knee, I put a potion on it.When the cat died, I informed him of Miss Hap's Animagus talent.And when he got bullied, I sent him an owl.Brandishing an official acceptance letter to Hogwarts, of course.It is only now, here at platform nine and three quarters, that I've come to regret my decision.He stands ready.Confident even.He has his books, his trolley, and my lies.His world's about to come crashing down and he doesn't even know it.It's for the best really, I try and tell myself.Every child has to lose their innocence.I just wish it didn't have to come so quickly and at the expense of the biggest thing that bonds us together.Erised starts to walk slowing escalating into a trot.I don't want to look.My hands cover my face as I gaze out between quivering fingers.The trot turns to a run.Tears form in my eyes.He's almost there.My body clinches in abhorrent fright.Then... nothing.The horror movie playing out before me never reaches a climax.He made it through.HE MADE IT THROUGH!But a jarring kick sends me spinning back down to reality.I'm no longer at the station, I'm at... a park?And what smells?God it's me!Looking up I make eye contact with the policeman that just crumpled my world."Move it bum" he bellows.I gather my things, knowing better than to argue.Plus, I was already beginning to feel the withdraws of my trip.A little white baggie drops and I scramble to pick it up.Thank god none spills.One hit left.I clunch the sandwich bag close to my chest as I shuffle off."Where would I be without you, Erised" I whisper to the packet."After all, you're my muse, my life's meaning."
