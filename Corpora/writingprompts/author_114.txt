The screen flashed Welcome player number one! as the sound of a slot machine blared incessantly from all corners of the room.Never had Ramses seen such a place, with great flashing lights and row upon row of bright red seats.Empty but nonetheless magnificently peculiar.He drew his gaze from one end to the other, near the bottom of the room he noticed a distinct white feather appearing from the top of a seat.That can only be the feathers of a filthy Nubian!Vile, wretched creature, what in the name of osiris are you doing in my tomb?

The feather wiggled and turned slowly, bobbing like the head of a chicken.But what appeared was not as charming as their innocent headdress.Fierce as the day he died, the archer appeared in full gear and assessed the hapless pharaoh.You dare threaten an archer when you yourself, a mortal enemy, are unarmed.You are only as strong as your soldiers, of which there are none that I see,  so give me a reason not to draw my bow and take aim

You cannot kill that which is already dead, Nubian.

And how do you ascertain that we are both dead?

The quarrel continued much the same.A never ending vollie of accusations and questioning only broken by the whir of the projector and movement on the screen.What proceeded was a showreel of various events throughout history.They sat down, a few seats apart, and watched in awe of this moving picture.From mighty huntsmen to mystic witch doctors, we give you the next incarnation!Amran a slave of the egyptian empire!

In a sick sort of irony the slot machines rang again, following a star wipe on the screen revealing the face of an exhausted women and a man from the perspective of a baby.Ramses couldnt help but fawn.Aww, a baby.

Seconds later the door of the house was violently kicked open and a slave driver stormed in 

Back to work slave!Your meaningless family can wait.

He pulled the man by the arm, slapped him across the face and shoved him through the door, meanwhile the women protested vehemently.The baby started to cry but the mother had not peace to comfort him, as she too was whipped into submission.Hysteria gripped the room.The Nubian turned to Ramses.Ramses looked the other way.The screen flashed again Due to recent complaints, the first 3 years of life will not be shown as they are quite boring.Please take this into account and enjoy the show

The boy is running running where?Theres terror in his breathing and as he looks back the streets are burning.Why is it dark?Where is everyone?Its a purge.Nubian archers armed with flaming arrows. 

The archer stared at the ground.TO BE CONTINUED
