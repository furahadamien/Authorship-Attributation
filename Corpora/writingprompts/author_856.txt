"I cannot use a *gun!"* Buddha complained."Just point and squeeze, man!"Satan said, taking a long drag on his cigarette.Long hair, beard, tendency to talk like a stoner...I was havin a *lot* of trouble telling him and Jesus apart."It's not the technicalities!"Buddha went on."I cannot *kill!*"

Jesus clasped his hand's together."He who lives by the sword shall die by the-"

*"SHUT UP!"* everybody else said."Look," I went on, "do you not agree that every being receives only their value in karma?"Buddha shrugged."Sure.""And that what happens to a person is *only* what they have earned?""Of course!""So by aiming that .50cal out the back and sending a bullet storm into those Space Nazis, are you not a brutal, *perfect* mechanism of karmic justice?"He blinked."Just do it, man!"Satan said."Ask forgiveness later or whatever."Buddha nodded."I'm going to do it.*I AM BECOME DEATH, THE DESTROYER OF WORLDS!*"

He smashed the rear window with the butt, aiming the gun out the back and spraying bullets like a madman, every so often stopping to throw some koan or words of wisdom out behind him.I leaned against the door."I just taught the purest soul in history how to kid his conscience.This day is going a little weirder than I expected.""You know what's weirder than that?"Satan asked.Jesus beamed."We're the same person, *maaaaan!"*

"Well she did nearly decapitate him!"Frigg said, squinting at me."Well, it wasn't really intentional, was it?"Odin went on, picking at his tooth with a spear."Does it--DO YOU SPEAK ASGARDLISH?""I can hear you," I said.He shruged."Nope, didn't understand a word.""Alfather," Baldr said, examining the object in question."It occurs to me that one side of this has been sharpened.""Fair point!"he replied."But for what purpose?My ravens inform me that this thing is for slicing... piece-a?Piece of what?I don't understand their handwriting, it's jibberish.""Could it be, say, classified as a short-nosed axe?"Heimdall asked."Well, no," Thor interrupted."The purpose of an axe is to channel a large amount of force through a small, sharpened point.And besides, the stainless steel is completely unsuitable for warfare.""I see," Heimdall replied."I don't see the half of it," Odin continued."We still haven't figured out if this is a weapon or not, and I'm getting very thirsty.""Should it not come down to intent?"Zeus asked."Now, Zeus, you have an advisory role on this council!Just because half your people went and started following that weirdo on the cross doesn't mean you have to spout Paulian garbage at me.He didn't even get any wiser!""We've been here for two hours!"Tyr complained."I'd give my right arm for some supper!""Alright, alright!"Odin replied."Can we just agree that this is a weapon and be done with it?It'll mean lunch, and we'd only have to backdate approval to... how many souls?""Nine hundred thousand, four hundred and sixty two," Heimdall answered."Good gods, these things are more dangerous than I thought," he went on, staring at the steel object like it might jump off the table."Right, it's a no from me.Valhalla is plenty crowded enough as it is.All in favour?""AYE!""W-wait!"I yelled."Sorry, can't hear you!"he said lifting his mallet."Take it up with a norn!"

I walked through the valley of the shadow of death, through turns winding and places so dark I couldn't see my own thoughts.And yet I feared no evil, for evil was done.Its hand print was already etched upon my skin, the hot thud against the back of my head tingling even now.But it was so cold in the valley.How strange, that a place with no wind might chill so.A glimmer caught my eye and I looked up; ahead of me was a gate, glowing in the void like the sun I had left so far behind me.A winding path beat up the vantic cliffs until it emerged from the shadows, vanishing under the ivory gates into a place where no gaze could penetrate.Was this it?Was this where I was supposed to be?I'd lost track of how long it had been since I had seen light.*"Lo!"* cried a booming voice, the sound reaching down the tall structure to where I stood in the shadows.I couldn't see who it belonged to."Who goes there?Speak thy name!""I am called Abel!"I cried back."Abel?"the voice repeated."Surely you are Adam?We have not expected anyone for some time yet.""I am not my father.And I am here unduly.I think...I suspect somebody caused me to die.That is, to end my life prematurely."There was silence.I could almost feel the echo of what I had described radiating down upon me like an angry fire, blazing rage and concern at the gravity of those words.A human caused another human to end.Even to me, it was frightening."What you say is grave," the voice replied."I do not wish to believe it to be true and yet... here you are.Far ahead of your time.What tragedy.""Who else has come this way?"I asked."I passed through places dark and shadows deep.""You passed through death," it replied."You are the first.""Who else *will* come this way?""All will come this way."I paused, glancing back the way I had come.Thoughts pierced my calm, of my mother and sisters walking through alone.Of children and old people who cried and howled in the darkness."What happens to me now?"There was no reply.I thought the speaker had gone away until the gate cracked open, the sides parting just enough to show a thin sliver of brilliant, white light between them.It was furious, but it did not burn me.The sensation of its warmth falling upon my face made me wish for nothing more than to draw closer."Now, you enter eternity."My foot landed on the ground in front of me, but when I went to raise the other I found I could not.It wasn't stuck or being held, at least not by anything external to me.A thought had entered my mind that I couldn't banish; *all will come this way.* What horrors I had experienced.What terrible silences and sensations."What lies inside?"I asked."I cannot tell you," the voice replied, "except to say, that once you are within you may never leave."I turned around.Pitch black lay in the direction I had come from, but I could find my way back to Earth if I tried.It would be horrible, but I had already gone through it once.It wouldn't be so bad for me a second time."I'm going back," I said."I do not wish for anyone to walk alone again.I will be their shepherd.""Then you will decay," the voice replied."The Light cannot sustain you without.Your skin will peel.Your muscles will fade.Your marrow will dry and you will be as the hollow bones under the earth."I nodded."So be it.""Abel... this is not a fate to wish upon oneself.Surely the flames would be better?"I turned, stepping back into the night."Loneliness and despair are equal partners to fire.I do not wish for my mother, father or siblings to come this way alone.I'll go wait for them.""You walk into limbo!"it warned, gradually fading into the distance behind me."If you turn back, you may never enter either of the worlds beyond.You will forever be a wayfarer!""So be it," I said, a sad smile curling across my mouth."I shall be a shepherd to all, then."Ahead I went, until the void wrapped around me like a blanket and the last shimmer of the gate disappeared.No sound, no sight, just a path in my still heart to guide a weary traveller, and the soft joy I felt in anticipation of seeing the Earth again.Of seeing my family.But I would never be a guide to my brother.
