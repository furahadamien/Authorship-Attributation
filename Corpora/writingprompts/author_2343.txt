Erdowahn
A distant observer could have thought that he was an already doting man, mesmerized by the dripping of the rainfall.Drop for drop...He took a deep breath.There was a faint scent of petrichor laying in the cold air.A scent that is the only impression of a long lost taste for him, dwelling in a dark abundant corner of his mind.Water.He tried to remember how much time passed since he last touched an ever so slight shimmer of water.The last time he ever touched... anything.He couldnt.But it hadto have happened somewhere about 850 years ago.Back then he read what made him the man he is.Statistics.His memories of them stayed precise and unclouded throughout the years:


100% of people who drink water will die 


A simple and unarguable fact.Every suicide bomber ate some food in the one year prior to his bombing


Each car accident had at least one car inflicted


These statistics seemed silly, obvious and of no use for anyone.Nonetheless was he seeing a somewhat deeper beauty in them.The beauty and rare appearance of inevitable truth.Truth.A thing society lost during the pace of the years.He realized that he saw what no one else was seeing.If he wanted to have no car accident, he had to never get close to car.If he wanted not to die by bombing himself, he had to stop eating.If he wanted not to die, he had to be the one not drinking water.A beauty and truth he embraced and thereby became what he is nowadays.A bonfire for everyone seeking sapience in verity.No one knew how he stayed alive for so long.Several people tried to live like him, but inescapably died.His secret is a mystery.Even to himself.His existence is boon and bane.Bane by living a joyless life with nothing but himself to harvest beauty and sanity.And Boon by granting humanity a vision.A vision of sanity and beauty.
