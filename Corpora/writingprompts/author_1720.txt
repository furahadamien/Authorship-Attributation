Hello, maybe I'm a little late to the party but this prompt really inspired me and it's my first time participating.So here goes.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tel'na couldn't believe it.After all these years she could finally see the famous Great Crossing with her own cristaline eyes.For as long as she could remember, her father had told her of the only place in Mol'nt where the five worlds intersected.When first she had spotted it, the city had looked like the remains of a gigantic beast of the past.Its black stone buildings of disparate shapes looking like so many old bones against the bright orange dust of the dry plains.But as the caravan approached, Tel'na could distinguish little specs of grey, silver and rust moving about the stone constructions.As they moved closer, she could see the specs were people pushing massive rocky carts around.Either carrying ore to the plaza where the portals were or coming back from it loaded with their exotic purchases.Tel'na's clan aligned its carts with those of the other stone men and pushed forward.A lot of the buildings were closed but from the few that she saw still open, Tel'na deduced that they were storehouses.She noticed some crystals for magic containment like the ones they were carrying and some food-pebbles but a lot of things that she saw she didn't know.And had no words to describe them.Upon arriving at the central plaza, she could barely contain her excitement.Massed around the four portals were beings from all the worlds just like her father had told her."Dad !Dad, look at them !", she hollered."Tel'na, behave girl.Remember we are here for trade.".His voice was calm as it always was.Barely showing any enthusiasm he motioned the caravan to stop."Yes, sorry.Would it bother you if I took a look around the plaza while you unload the carts ?"she said, straining to speak slowly.Her father's granite face cracked up and a light smile showed."Fine, but take your brother with you so I can concentrate on the job.""Thank you, Dad.Gar'ek come on !".The little rockling fell down the cart and skipped over to his sister, giggling all the way.Tel'na grabbed his bluish grey hand and inserted herself into the crowd.As her eyes scanned the creatures around her, she remembered her father's lessons.There were pairs of fish people from Pessym walking around in their coats of water held together by magic.Their world lacking any earth to walk on, they looked quite awkward as they slithered on sand and stone.The beasts from Nokris seemed more at ease with their long limbs covered in thick black fur.But when he noticed them, Gar'ek whined in fear as their faces lacked eyes.Their world had no fire or light and so those would have been useless to them.Tel'na turned away from them and ended face to face with a cloud of red and purple energy.She frose and the living cloud just went through her like she wasn't there.She felt tiny sparks jump all over hher dense body and fell backwards.She was starting to gather her thoughts on the ground when she felt hands pick her up and put her gently back on her feet."Watch your step missy.These guys from Luzz are so used to their airless void that we barely register to them.And they pack quite a punch.""Sorry I guess I wasn't paying attention.Thank you.""Don't mention it.Want me to take you back to your mates?"This being was probably a human from Terra although it was hard to tell what he looked like under the heavy protection he wore to guard himself against Mol'nt's burning sun and dry air."No it's alright.I'm taking a tour wit my b..." Tel'na turned her head but all she could see around her were colorful strangers.Gar'ek was nowhere to be found."Oh no... Gar'ek !Gar'ek where are you?", she yelled bursting through the humans in front of her.She started running randomly, calling out to her lost brother.After a while she had to catch her breath and she stopped near the center of the plazza.She inhaled deeply, feeling a deep anguish building inside her.And then she saw him.He was right in front the portal to Terra, just standing there."Gar'ek stay there!Don't move!", she yelled.Her brother waved at her cheerfully and then jumped through the portal.
