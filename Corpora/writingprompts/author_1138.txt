You open to a random page, read the words "you are now a handsome billionaire, loved by all, especially your harem of gorgeous women."and frantically try to reverse engineer what series of events got you to this outcome.You realize you deviated from the path due to a seemingly inconsequential choice you made because it was funny, and are now miserable for eternity.
