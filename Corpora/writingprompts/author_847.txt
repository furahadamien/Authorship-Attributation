We raced around the corner in our stolen Humvee, tipping onto two wheels for a few dangerous moments before slamming back onto the ground.The vehicle groaned, stressed even despite its robust, Mil-Spec design.Maybe it wasnt designed for fighting zombie, I dont know.Accelerating down the street, I looked over my shoulder, taking my eyes off the road for a few precious seconds.My eyes caught a glimpse of a few of the faster ones rounding the corner in the distance before there was a sickening lurch, and we were airborne.As we slammed into the ground my lip got caught between my teeth, and I felt the coppery taste of blood fill my mouth.Maybe I should explain how I got here.The day started out normally enough.I woke up fairly late, having the day both off of school and work, an unusual combination for me.Stretching, I reached for my phone, checking for notifications.The only thing I saw was a post Id been tagged in on Facebook.Shrugging, I opened it up, figuring I had a few minutes before I needed to start my day.It was one of those Who would be in your post-apocalypse team posts.I shrugged, and had almost closed the app when I realized that the pictures werent the standard action heroes and celebrities.In fact, they were religious figures like Mohammed, Jesus, Satan, and The Flying Spaghetti Monster.I snorted, but started typing my comment.Hitting the post button, I went to shower and eat breakfast.As I finished eating, my doorbell rang.Looking up at the clock quizzically, I stood up to go check who it was.I wasnt expecting a delivery or company, so no one should have been at the door.I looked out the peephole, and was even more confused.A man, dressed in a white robe with a red sash, stood outside, checking his phone.I almost didnt answer the door, but something about the way he was dressed had me curious.Opening the door, I left the screen door closed.Uh, hi.Who are you?  
  
The man looked up, his eyes piercing and almost luminescent.My name is Jesus.Jesus Christ.You said you needed a post-apocalyptic survival team?  
  
I mean, I did reply to that- hey wait a minute, are you stalking me on Facebook?  

 
Snorting, he shakes his head.No, but the apocalypse is scheduled to start in about 5 minutes.We should go inside for the first part, otherwise this will be a very short lived team.  
  
I almost slammed the door, but then I looked past him.A white McLaren was parked at the curb, and a dark red one was pulling up behind it.My eyes widened as a man with red skin in a suit stepped out.Looking at my mailbox, he checked his phone and nodded.Walking up my driveway, he inclined his head to the man already outside my door as he stopped next to him.Hello Jesus, long time no see, he said, looking down at his phone and typing something.Satan, it has been a while. The man in the white robe turned to look at me.Well, are you going to let us in?Were down to about 3 minutes.Buddha will be a bit late, he always is.  

I stared at them both, and then the cars again.Much as I didnt want to let them in, I wanted to know why two guys dressed like they were had cars that nice.Maybe it wouldnt hurt?I knew that saying that probably made my chances of it going well worse, but my chances probably werent high to begin with.Opening the door, I stepped to the side wordlessly.They walked in, checking their phones.The one in the suit closed the door behind him, still on his phone.Looking up to me staring, he winked and walked into the living room after the one in the robe.Following them, I kept scratching my head.I shouldnt have let them in my house.Why did I do that?Why wasnt I asking them to leave?Before I could follow that train of thought, their phones started blaring a warning klaxon at the same time.The one in the suit just kept typing, and the one in the robe swiped away a notification without looking at it as their phones stopped the noise.Well, here we go, the one in the robe said, looking out the window.Looking outside with him, my jaw dropped.The sky had turned a dark gray color, and there were columns of light scattered about.What looking like people were rising up the columns through the clouds and disappearing.I opened the window and looked around, but it was definitely real.I have to be going crazy.Thats thats the only thing that makes sense. I started breathing heavily, my head pounding.Suddenly, there was a new knock on the door, and I felt a calming presence outside.The other two nodded.There he is.Why does being at peace come with the inability to be anywhere on time? the man in the suit said it as he put his phone away.The man in the robe shrugged.No idea, but at least we can get started.Do you think he got it?  
  
Shrugging, the man in the suit headed towards the door.No idea, but we need to leave.It wont be safe here for much longer.  
  
I stared back and forth between them, bewildered.I still felt that odd feeling of peace, despite my apparent mental breakdown, but it was as if something nearby was telling me it didnt matter, and that it would be all right.The man in the robe followed the one in the suit, and I followed the two of them, hoping theyd leave and my mental break would end.Instead, they opened the front door, and a man in an orange robe was standing out front, whistling.He was jingling a set of keys, and he broke into a wide smile when he saw us.Ah, so you are still here.Good, I wasnt sure.Come, I found the vehicle you wanted.The soldiers using it didnt seem to have much need for it with the chaos around them.  
   
I looked behind him to see what he was talking about, and my jaw dropped.There was a Humvee parked on my lawn, with the U.S. flag painted on the doors, and what appeared to be a machine gun on the roof.Staring at it, I swallowed hard.What the fuck is that Humvee doing on my lawn?Are you guys insane?Or am I actually hallucinating?  
  
All three of them looked at me at the same time and the orange one spoke up.We know you dont understand.Let me keep it simple.That post you replied to this morning?It was a legitimate question.You picked us first, so you get to have us.I am Buddha, and this man in the suit is Satan, and the other one is Jesus.Well keep you safe, or at least try our best.Now, let us go, the zombie are about to come around the corner.  
  
I opened my mouth to say something, and then there was a crash.Looking around, I saw a door fall flat on the sidewalk, and a shambling figure step out of it.It was very clearly missing body parts it really, really should have had.Grabbing my jacket, I held my hand out for the keys.Fine, but Im driving. My voice was surprisingly steady and calm.They looked at each other, finally shrugging.The one in the orange robe, Buddha I guess, tossed the keys to me.I slid into the drivers seat as Satan took the passenger seat while Buddha and Jesus took the back seats.Starting the Humvee, I stepped on the gas and headed for down town.Where are we headed? I asked as I drove, belatedly realizing I had no idea where we were going.The Downtown mall.Itll be full of people, but we need supplies, and we have an advantage on our side, Satan said casually, eyeing the rearview mirror.Nodding, I sped up and headed onto the freeway.Passing more of those shambling figures from time to time, we also saw survivors who waved at us for help.We didnt stop until the crash.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spitting the blood out of my mouth and out the window, I turned to see what had happened.It looked like Id hit a median, and it had launched us into the air.Luckily, Id hit it at just the right angle to keep us on track.The bad news was, we were surrounded by zombies, and they were getting closer.Looking around in a panic, my gaze stopped on Buddha.We can help you.All you have to do is ask. 
He said it simply, but I suddenly understood what I was doing wrong.A plan sprung to mind, and I started firing out orders as I started to switch seats.Jesus, take the wheel.Satan, get behind me, Im riding shotgun.Buddha man the .50 cal.
