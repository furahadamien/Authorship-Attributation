Earth was doomed but the dagger in my hands could be humanities salvation.Well the salvation of an super tiny fraction of its population.I had what?Three years?Somewhat over a thousand days?I would have to stab ten people a day to get into 5 digits.But still saving thousands was saving thousands even if it was out of billions.I sat in my dark living room looking out at the thousands of tiny lights of a cities skyline.Each a person or a family doomed to die in three years if I didn't stab them with a fucking dagger.I turned the dagger in my hands, it was a pretty thing looking more suited for something ceremonial than fighting.But then murdering people in alleyways was a dead end anyway.There is no way I would reach even a hundred people without get caught.And if I ran from the police and a bullet killed me I wouldn't even be able to enter the new world myself.Maybe I convince other of its purpose, maybe I could get the public to believe me, maybe they would line up in orderly rows, a new one stepping forward each time one fell and was whisked away by helpers, so that I had to do nothing beside stab and stab and stab until they were all dead.It could happen I suppose.In the first night after I picked it up, the dagger gave me knowledge through vivid dreams that didn't fade after waking up  maybe I could get it to give the same to others.Convince some journalist that way, and they might get me into contact with politicians and spread the message.Once it hit critical mass I probably wouldn't even have to do anything myself, they would choose someone else as executioner and it would be out of my hand.Maybe I would offer to be the first to die to demonstrate my believe in the dagger.It could happen, but I didn't actually know how to make the dagger do that.I knew how to choose a successor, alas the process was not suitable to recruit followers.Without that could I convince anyone?People would just think I was hallucinating .Maybe some would come out of desperation but without public acceptance the police would stop me.But there was some magic in this world, maybe I could find someone with the knowledge to make the dagger spread its message.I wanted to curse the being who gave me the dagger but a pitiful chance to save some of us is still better than none I suppose.My phone chimed reminding me that I only had fifteen minutes until my brother was here.He was smart and brave and if I just told him about this I am sure he would believe me and do his best to support me.He probably had a much better idea what too do than I did.Why did I get this blade anyway?It is not like I was someone special...I studied the blade one last time.And then?I killed myself.Of course I left my brother a note near the front door, some personal, some half formed ideas for what you could do with the dagger.I won't tell you all about it but I suppose you deserve to know part of."[]And again I am truly sorry for leaving you behind to deal with this, but the responsibility was simply to great for me.Don't grieve my death remember I am not truly dead just the first to escape to another world.Instead curse me for leaving you with the burden and having the time of my life in another world.I truly believe you will do a better job than I could ever have done but if it gets too much I certainly won't blame you for choosing the same escape I did.And remember if your life is ever in real danger kill yourself with the dagger, I expect to see you here sometime during the next three years.No matter how many you save you must save yourself too.Also don't touch the dagger yet, you are already its next carrier so it will return to you when you call it even if the police took it as evidence.And remember to hide this one, the other suicide note should be enough to convince them it was suicide.I have another idea, maybe if you get someone important to at least listen you can tell them you will pick a person of their choice as successor and if that person suddenly believes after you die, risky but it just might be enough 

I am an idiot aren't I?You know just pick the president of the USA as successor and follow me immediately.I am half tempted to to do it myself now but then how could I be sure you would ever get to follow me?Well if you don't find anything wrong with that plan I expect you to follow me soon.Be safe.[]

The boring predictable ending for a scenario like this I suppose.
