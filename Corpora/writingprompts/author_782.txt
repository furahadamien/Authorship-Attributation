It was her favorite night of the year, and one of the few in which people willingly opened their doors to strangers.Halloween.Josie could barely contain her excitement, as she rose early that evening.Luckily, her windows had been treated against UV rays, and she had black out curtains everywhere.She stretched lazily, and opened the curtains surrounding her elegant four post bed.The room seemed bright to her eyes, but they soon adjusted.It had to be about 4pm, though evening was beginning earlier every day.The floor was cold.She frowned, and scooted her feet hurriedly into a pair of fuzzy slippers sitting beside her bed.They would be considered "cute" by most, but for some reason walking in the brightly colored unicorn slippers brought her a perverse sense of glee.Josie shuffled over to her towering wardrobe, looking for an appropriate outfit for the best day of the year.There was the baby blue ball gown decorated with cream lace and ruffles.No, that would require a hoop skirt, petticoat, and corset.Far too much effort, and she would stand out.She hadn't lived this long by standing out.She sifted through the clothing with a delicate hand.They were original dresses from the periods after all, not costumes.Josie clicked her tongue in distaste.A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts."Come in, Thomas."She could hear his heartbeat, slow, but still present.A link to the outside world.A sullen looking young man entered cautiously.His brown hair stuck up haphazardly, and his clothing was atrocious.Josie sighed, as Thomas struck an indignant pose."I hate it when you call me that."He huffed, leaning against the door frame while attempting to act as if he were indifferent.The thumping of his heartbeat was suddenly loud, fast, and incredibly distracting."My name is Tom."He wore a band tshirt, and ripped dirty jeans.He looked completely out of place with the opulent surroundings."Your proper name is Thomas, and that is what I shall call you."Josie slammed the door of the wardrobe shut.Tom shifted uncomfortably before her gaze, a large bag crinkling in his hands.The red bullseye on the bag stood out garishly."Now, what reason do you have for pestering me?""I got you a few things for tonight-" Tom approached her quickly as he spoke, holding out the bag."I thought you might need a costume, and I saw something that may be a problem."He looked pleased with himself, like an over eager puppy.He pulled out a plastic bag with a picture of a scantily clad woman on it.The woman was wearing a low cut dress with high slits, beneath a waist cinching corset and a velvet cloak.The woman in the picture smiled seductively and wore fake plastic fangs.Josie laughed raucously suddenly.She couldn't believe humans thought that was what a vampire looked like."It will help you blend in at the party."Tom's face flushed as Josie stepped closer to hold the costume bag.In truth, she suspected Tom just wanted her to wear it.She eyed the healing bite marks on his neck for a moment, her fangs extending.She shook the thought away.She had fed on him recently.He also pulled out a large dark mat that said Welcome on it."They're getting more creative with welcome mats now.They don't all invite you inside.Would you believe I saw some with just pumpkins on them?Others just said Hello."He snorted derisively."I thought if I replaced the one at the party, it would make it easier on you."Josie oohed with delight, her vibrant blue eyes sparkling as she patted Tom on the head.She leaned close, and whispered in his ear, enjoying the shiver that passed through him."That's why you're my favorite pet."She took the costume with a small amount of displeasure, and went to change in her bathroom.I know it's a little camp-y, but all I could think of was "What if she went to the house and the doormat didn't welcome her inside?".
