To spite the devil even further, Dr. Jamos Wikheusen spent a very small fraction of his now limitless life spreading this "cure" to all humans, thereby eliminating all causes of natural death, and severely decreasing the number of newcomers arriving to hell.Life on Earth, for a short while at least, became utopia.People reveled in a world where time no longer restrained a person's life.But after learning all that could be learned, tasting all that could be tasted, and seeing all of the world's beauty, man's thirst for newness, his desire for stimulation, led him down a path of self destruction.Perversion, suffering, pain, and sadism were all sought not as a way to find meaning in a now meaningless life, but as a way to simply feel alive.Having lost the concept of morality, mankind brought hell itself to the world of the living.And those who wanted peace and quiet, an escape from hell on earth, would resort to ending their own lives.But with religion banished long ago, and with it, it's quaint ideas on gods and afterlife, humanity had long forgotten that damning eternal consequence of suicide.In this way, the devil didn't win the soul of Dr. Jamos Wikheusen, but did win the souls of billions more.
