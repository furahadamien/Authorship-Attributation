I have always heard stuff like, "Fathers are the first heroes of their daughters" but then why is my situation the opposite?I laugh at the word hero because to me my father is my villain.He should treat me like his princess but he treats me like his robot.I really want to learn driving but he doesn't allow me to drive.He also restricted me from going on an abroad trip with friends.Apart from this, his strict behaviour with me has made me hate him even more.His strictness has crossed all the boundaries of liberty.In short, he makes me feel that my home is a second name for jail.I am sure jail must be better place than my home at least.Well a few days back, it was his birthday and i wanted to forget all my hatred for him on that day, so to make him happy i gave him a mug of number 1 father.Last night as soon as i got to know about the bizarre mug changes, i rushed to see the rank of my father while expecting him to have the worst rank.But what i saw completely shattered me and almost gave me a heart attack.His rank was in the low hundreds out of all the fathers.All through the night i kept wondering that how can the worst father be ranked so high?After investing over 10 hours on  this, i realised that it was not my father who was the worst, it was me actually.I always saw his actions in a negative way without considering the love and care hidden behind those.He didn't allow me to drive because in our country it's illegal to drive before getting 18 years old so he was just trying to make me a good citizen.He didn't allow me to go on trips abroad because it was unsafe for me to go there all alone without any elder person being with me and last but the most important factor, he was strict because if he wouldn't have been then i would have not been a responsible girl with great moral values like I am today.Since i always used to argue whenever he used to tell me something in a polite manner, he was left with no other option to make me a better person except for being a little bit strict.Like all the daughters, I wont say my dad is my 1st hero, but i will say my dad is the best hero I can ever have!
