I blearily attempted to focus my eyes on my phone as its notification sound went off repeatedly.I had just managed to get to a comfortable position and doze for a good hour before my phone decided to freak out, and I was none too happy.One government alert that read "DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON", followed by 600 messages from numbers I didn't recognize spouting some nonsense about how it was a beautiful night."Don't look at the moon", I said."Good advice."I turned off my phone, rolled over, and drifted back to sleep.The next day, I was stunned to discover the horrible truth of what those messages were really about: a guerilla marketing stunt by Sony Pictures for some stupid horror movie about a moon cult using cell phones to murder people.Unfortunately, it had caused a "War of the Worlds"-type panic, and the resulting lawsuits all but obliterated the studio.But on the plus side, the rights to Spider-Man defaulted over to Marvel Studios and now there could never be a Pixels 2, so it was all kind of a wash in the end.
