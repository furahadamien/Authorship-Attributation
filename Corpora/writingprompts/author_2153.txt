To the Justice Unit, he was a mere has been.To us, however, he was a milestone in all of our lives.My father,  Mega-Kill Sr., was his arch nemesis for decades.I remember when I was 17 or 16, my pops gave me his suit.He said to me; "Georgie,  if you want to be a real villain,  you gotta know how to fight a super."So with me wearing the mega-elector suit  (which was about 3 sizes to big) and a death blaster, I made my way to mainstreet during the lunch or dinner  hour, but i'm not sure what time it was, it would be around 30  years ago.So I raise the death blaster, I aimed it at something like a mail box or a fire hydrant, or something, and before I could even press the trigger,  there he was.Maximum Justice; Head founder of the Justice Unit.He appeared right next to me and crushed the gun's barell between 2 of his fingers.I went into punch him, crashed my fist straight on his nose.Broke my hand for 4 months.He didn't hit me back, god knows I deserved it though.I was just a punk trying to be like his punk father.Looking back, I think Maximum Justice knew that.It wasn't just me though, all the members of the Tyranny Union  had parent super villians, whom most of us took our names from.400 villains in the tyranny Union,  all of whom got their start with Maximum Justice.Somewhere over the years things began to change for Maximum.He got slower, weaker, older.Any Tyranny Union member could of killed him years ago, but none of us could.We had to much respect for the man who was a giant in this industry.The heroes, those jack ass', never understood that.That the man they would be little was the foundation of what they do.Oh it made me sick.During the usual street brawls, they would force Maximum Justice to stay in the car, like a kid or a dog.Treating him as an errand boy, giving him demeaning jobs to make him feel useful.Who makes Maximum Justice take out his dry cleaning and get his coffee?The man is dead now.Died of a cardiac arrest in Justice Unit Headquarters.A warrior like him didn't deserve such a mediocre death.He should of died saving the planet, like he always invisioned.Sone people think that's why he stayed with the Justice Unit, so he could have the death he deserved, like his fallen comrades had.One died in an a alin attack, one died redirecting a nuke into space, the other died stopping the sun exploding.But Maximum Justice, the icon, the legend, dies because of a cardiac arrest?It's not fair.I arrived to his funeral out of costume, along with other Tyranny Union members.What we found was nothing less of disgusting.The Justice Unit had passed on the responsibility of planning his funeral, unlike what they had done for other members who received statues and magnificent pieces of art that honored them.All Maximum got was a small church, with only the Tyranny Union and an old Priest to pay final respect.The public itself completely disassociate itself with the great hero.The Hercules of the modern Era, gone and forgotten.No.This will not stand.The Tyranny Union will make this city and the Justice Union mourn.
