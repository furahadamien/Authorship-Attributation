The door handle started to turn.Sweat began dripping down my brow."No one has keys to my door, not even me."I screamed.The door swung open.A large figure, stood blocking the sunlight behind it, like a large oak tree clamouring for the precious morning rays."SON" A voice bellowed.I knew that voice, a voice so familiar it made me cry tears."SON I AM HOME" 

No it can't be, Dad?Father?It can't be, he left 10 years ago for cigarettes and never came back, ma just thought he slipped into the ice and starved to death."SON, IT'S ME.PAPA" The man howled.I built up the courage to reply "Be gone with you"

The figure just stood there.I ran to the bathroom and grabbed Ma's favourite rifle.My hands were shaking like a leaf on the wind.I walked back into the hallway, aimed my rifle and fired.Hitting the figure in the neck, causing him to collapse.As I approached the man an unpleasant realisation hit me like freight train that can't stop.He was in fact my beloved father."Papa no I'm sorry, I'm sorry.How are you here, you're supposed to be in the icy lake.I love you papa" I fought through the tears.My father tried to speak, but was struggling due to the blood building in his throat."Son, *blargagag* I ... love you... *blereghee* I'll never leave you again" 

His yellowed bloodshot eyes rolled back completely into into his head.He had died in agonising pain."WHY JESUS!WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME" I cried out to the heavens.I hugged papa one last time, then began dragging him outside all whislt trying not to slip away on the copious amounts of blood on the floor.After an hour of dragging him, I reached a frozen lake.I dragged papa over and slid him into a hole in the ice.He sank down, vanishing back into the chilling abyss where he came from.Merry Christmas Papa
