My name is... well I suppose that doesn't matter.Last year I took on a very interesting "apprentice".I helped him grow into a young man somewhat capable of taking on his own challenges.The last time I saw him, he was heading off to confront his father.I wonder how he is going?Anyway, I don't think I have long, so consider this my memoir.900 years ago, I was born.I know, it's a long time to live, but trust me, I have served a very fruitful life.I was quite acrobatic in my younger years, even going back to a mere 25 years ago, I could jump with the rest of them.I've been here for just over 20 years now.I actually retreated from civilisation back then.I also have never drunk water.In case I don't make it, here is my short tale.My life was pretty boring for much of the first century.It took until 96 years old to actually make something of myself.Basically, I served as a high ranking member of an important religious institution.It was pretty boring I suppose.So I amused myself with a little game I played.I would constantly mix up my words.On purpose, of course, nobody actually talks like that.I worked pretty hard for the first few centuries of my life.My spirituality was pretty strong in those days, not a lot clouded my thoughts.But something happened about 105 years ago.I was pretty much the leader of my religion, and I had this special guy under my wing.I mean, he wasn't perfect, sure, but he was a good kid.Worked his way up to the top.In fact, aside from myself and my right hand man, he was pretty much my best man.Eventually, we fell apart, and I didn't see him for a long time.At around 864 years old, this other kid came along.He was really something.Rather old to join us, but hey, he seemed really keen to learn.So, against my better judgement, I took him on.Of course, I was in control of the most influential religion around, so I couldn't exactly teach him myself.I trusted him with one of my favourite students.Unfortunately, he did die just before he could take this young bloke on fully.However, there was another young man I could trust.He was witty, but clever.I handed over my young student to this man.For years, they worked together and actually brought a lot of peace to many different places.Around 26 years ago, war broke out.It started off as trade disputes, and advanced into all out war.Luckily, as the strongest religious order known to man, we were able to convince government to send forces to fight off the opposing forces.It was a long war, lasting a solid 3 years, and wouldn't have ended if it weren't for that bloody dictator.For some stupid reason, we chose him to be the head of the government.Bad mistake.Within months of the war ending, most of my fellow religious folk were dead.The government turned against us.It was very violent.The military completely betrayed us.Our numbers were dwindling.It was a sad state of affairs.I tried to kill the man in charge.Unfortunately, I failed.I wasn't strong enough to kill him.I barely survived.And I retreated.That was about 23 years ago.Now, things aren't getting any better.There's that "apprentice" I was telling you about, but aside from him, nobody from the old days is alive anymore.The young man who took on the small boy is dead.The small boy himself is no more.So, now I have no choice.I am so thirsty.I am sitting here, so tempted.I held off from drinking any water my entire life.It was part of my religion.I just couldn't go against the words of my predecessors.But, it is a desperate time.I don't even know if my "apprentice" is coming back.I don't know if I should.Maybe just a sip.You know, just to get a taste of things.I've never indulged myself.But I know the risk.100% of people who drink water die.Do I really want to guarantee my fate like that?How soon will it be until I die?Surely not instantly?Maybe... maybe if I get word that my bro is coming back?I...I suppose I should just do it?Just... into the hands.Now, into the mouth.Wow.That's actually not bad.This is what I've been missing my whole life?Oh no.Oh.Shit.This is not good.I think I'm going to... pass... o... out...I'M AWAKE!Oh.No one around.That was stupid of me.I feel like I'm going to die.Jeez, I won't even get to see that kid again.Oh man, my life has been a failure.NO!Compose yourself man!You can do this.Just got to keep breathing.FUCK!I knew it was true.I knew if I drink that darn water that I would die.I'm actually going to die all alone.Wh- WAIT!Is that?OH!I think it is!The kid is back!I can't believe he's still alive!It's a miracle!OH NO!Should not have tried to sit up.That was a mistake.I feel worse.I don't know how long I have now, but can't be longer than an hour or two.Well, I suppose I should get up and say goodbye.Should I do the voice?Yeah, definitely the voice.I've kept it up this long in front of everyone, can't have that twat spoil the game for me.I get up off my bed and see him.Shit, he's missing his hand.Poor bloke looks horrified.I'd better say something...


"Hmm.That face you make.Look I so old to young eyes?"Before I die, I should probably tell him about his father...
