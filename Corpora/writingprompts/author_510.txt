Bryce Morrison thought he had it all: a loving wife, a charming son, and a satisfying job.Yet there was something that nagged at him - a constant feeling that he wasn't good enough.On The Day of the Mugs, his suspicions appeared to be confirmed."#598,432 Dad."The jarring bold words remained seared in his memory throughout the day, clouding every action and every word.After work, Bryce returned to an empty house.Marie was out for dinner with friends and Billy had soccer practice.Perhaps a few hours of SportsCenter would help ease his mind.But alas, there came a sudden knock at the door."Hey there, bud!"Bryce opened the door to discover Tom Gilbert, a fellow father from across the street.He clutched a mug in his hand that read "#49,534 Dad.""I was just wonderin' if you had any interest in a nice homemade hamburger.We've got some leftovers from the cookout."Bryce narrowed his eyes."Actually, I was thinking of cooking a bit myself.Mind if I drop by?"Tom took a sip of his drink and lifted an eyebrow."Uhhh...sure.By all means."Bryce ran back to the kitchen and pulled a fresh ground beef patty out of a refrigerator drawer.He bolted across the street, dropped the patty on Tom's grill, and started to cook it.*This'll be the best damn burger ever made,* he thought.*I'll show that smug bastard.*

It was, by all accounts, a pretty damn good burger.Tom took a bite and gave him the thumbs up.***

The next morning, Bryce's mug read "#432,726."Not good enough.Bryce asked to take his vacation early, left a note for the family, and began searching for every potential dad in the county.He went to small businesses, office buildings, parks and parking lots, challenging anyone that would listen.He fixed motors, went fly fishing, played 30 rounds of golf and showed impeccable taste in microbreweries.As the week progressed, his rank continued to climb.But at a certain point - roughly 200,000 - it plateaued.For a moment, Bryce was tempted to smash the mug, right then and there.He tried some more Dad Tasks - refurbishing a porch, buying a new polo wardrobe - but nothing worked.The rank plummeted, and soon it was back in the range of 500,000.Bryce drove home, dejected.He'd been texting Marie throughout the week, but she didn't seem to understand the nature of his quest.Then again, how could she?His wife and son embraced him the moment he stepped inside."Daddy, I missed you!"Billy cried, dropping his Lego truck to the ground.Marie looked understandably irritated but kissed him on the cheek nonetheless.Bryce sighed."I just couldn't stand it.I never thought I was a good dad, and that mug proved it."Marie chuckled and shook her head."What's a number got to do with anything?"Billy hugged his father's leg."I love you no matter what, Daddy!"Bryce smiled and patted him on the head.Over the next few days, the rank on the mug slowly began to climb again, but it sat dormant in a kitchen cabinet.Within a week, Bryce forgot it had ever existed.*I might not be perfect,* he decided.*But I'm good enough.*

I never expected to catch a flight to Paris on a Tuesday night, but life has a way of surprising you.When I noticed the odd balance in my checking account, I did the usual: called the bank, reported a fraudulent charge, got the card cancelled.The receptionist told me the charge had an international origin and was spent at a *boulangerie* in the Latin Quarter of Paris.Otherwise, no further information.I booked a flight minutes after hanging up.From there, it was a matter of following the paper trail.I got repeated surges of adrenaline wandering into cafes and gift shops, asking questions, collecting information.It had been eight years since I'd done this type of work, and it felt spectacular.You don't fuck with a retired detective.The guys covered their tracks pretty well but, as luck would have it, two of 'em wandered into the same cafe just a half hour apart.Bad move.I found out where the second guy lived, booked a hotel room right next door, and bought a pair of binoculars.Reconnaissance took longer than anticipated.I also ordered too much room service and fancy French wine and cheese.Hey, if you're retired and in Paris, what else are you gonna do?The next day, I decided to make my move.Slowly.My back hurts all the damn time these days.Turned out it was a dud.The guy had left earlier in the morning and I was too much of a lazy fuck to get up at the crack of dawn, so I decided to look for the other guy.God, it took a while.I overestimated my own skills, to be honest.Maybe it was hubris, maybe it was fear of my own age.But with about two thousand bucks left in my account - don't even remember how many euros that is - I found him.I gave a firm knock on the door and he opened it right up."Hello?"I punched him square in the jaw.Again, hubris.He threw me to the ground within seconds and whipped out a knife."Give me one good reason to not cut you to pieces, *connard*.""You stole something from me.Ten dollars of hard earned cash.I want it back."He lowered the knife and laughed."Ha!An American, I take it.You think you can come here and be like...who is it?Bruce Willis.Arnold Schwarzenegger.A real hero.Well, this is bigger than you'll ever understand, old man.So I suggest you run on back home and we'll forget this ever happened."God.What was I thinking?I honestly believed that I could put a stop to it and get back what was mine.But when you're pushing eighty?Well...I guess I valued my life more than that, at least in that moment.He let me go, but not without another threat.He told me there would be eyes on me now and for the rest of my life, even back in America.Yeah, sure, pal.I've heard a hundred empty threats just like that.I booked a plane ticket back to San Diego with the last of my money and collapsed in my apartment.Later that week, I took a part-time job at a bakery.Easy stuff - after-hours cleaning and shelving.Calls itself a *boulangerie*, but it's pretty shit compared to France.I'm saving my money to fly back to Paris, because I'm not done with these bastards.One day, I'll get that $10, even if it fucking kills me.
