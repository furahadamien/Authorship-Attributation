Empty-Heart
I already knew.Her voice had been growing louder in recent weeks.She said she would find me.I knew she would, one day.It was all that gave her purpose.I was.She had nothing left.Except me, the one who was always there but never 'really' there.The one who failed her.I might as well have killed them all myself, she would tell me, black eddies of loss and hatred roiling over from her into me.She wasn't wrong.It used to be so faint.The first time I noticed that I sometimes had another voice in my head I was maybe six, but it was probably there even before that.I just didn't understand what it was before then.Even at six, it was soft and indistinct enough that it felt like it came from my own mind, that she was just some neglected part of my being gently calling for my attention.Like my feminine side trying to express itself through an imaginary friend, or some other such psycho-babble nonsense.I think one of my mom's hippy friends came up with that.I told my mom everything.Like everything.As a kid, anyway.She always wanted to know what was going on in my little brain.She said it was so much more interesting visiting my world than living in hers.So of course she knew about the voice, my invisible playtime partner who was always there.And that her name was Rosie.Still, Mom was a pretty easygoing person, so she wasn't too worried about it.Lots of kids went through this phase.Just meant I had a better imagination than most, that I was a bright spark in a  dull universe and one day I'd light up like a star in the sky, shining for all the world to see.She told me that, all the time.I'm not ashamed to admit that she spoiled me.More than a little.Seven, eight, nine."Well, yes, he's a little old for imaginary friends, but it's not like it's hurting anyone.He has lots of real friends at school, too, and he's doing very well in all his classes so I just don't see the cause for your concern, Principal Morley...  

"Yes...I'm sorry, are you honestly trying to tell me that you think my son is a bad influence on the other children?He's a model student!Of course Ms.  Evans thinks he has a disorder, she's paid to think that.If she had her way, half the student body would be medicated."Yes, alright, fine!If it'll make you stop wasting my time with these senseless calls I'll take him for an evaluation.What was the name again?Uh-huh.Okay, thanks.Yes you have a marvelous day, too."She shook her head as she hung up, then smiled at me.It was a smile so free of worry or concern it could have smoothed any frown-lines for twenty miles.I can't recall seeing it again after that.Ten.A full year of psychiatric and neurological testing and evaluation.If I wasn't in a shrink's office I was in an MRI or a doctor's waiting room.I was deemed unsafe to be around other children.My ability to differentiate between fantasy and reality was seriously compromised.I very likely had schizophrenia and there was no telling when I might snap and harm myself or someone else.Medication would eventually put me on a more even keel.We would just have to experiment a bit to find the right combination and dosages.Eleven.Fifteen.I don't remember being twelve.Or thirteen.Or fourteen.Only fragments of lucidity between different treatment regimens.Some time after I turned fifteen they found a group of pills that didn't rob me of my soul.They did nothing to quiet Rosie.Nothing had.Rosalyn.She didn't like being called Rosie anymore.Not even from me.Too kiddish.She had boobs now, for fuck sake.Rosie wasn't gonna cut it.Maybe Rose... a little cheesy...Her boyfriend could call her that maybe, when she got one.Soon.'Jesus Christ...Seriously not interested in your boobs right now.My head is killing me.''Holy fuck!You're alive!And you're loud today.It's like you're talking right in my ear.''Watch your mouth please.My mom's right here.''I'm not using my mouth, so there, dickstick.''Ha.Yeah well you might end up using mine by mistake again.I haven't been this awake in...I don't even know.You know this whole thing's a little more sensitive coming off some of these drugs.I really need to look normal right now.They might let me go home soon.''Yeah-yeah.Fine.I'll try to keep it PG.'[... more later, maybe]
