The first time it happened I was talking to Steve.His sight was on the table next to us, and he didn't noticed I shifted my position.It lasted around 5 seconds, but it was frightening.He noticed it a little bit but I told him I was ok.The second time may have been on the elevator.It suddenly stopped for around 5 min and made me jump.I felt I was trapped, but the lights were on.I tried to call for help, but nobody answered.I thought I may be drowning, and when I stopped there was a sudden breeze.The elevator opened, Steve saw my faced and couldn't contain the laughter.Usually, during these events, moving feels different, air is as thick as water, but you can create paths where you have moved before, where it is thin.When the time stops a breeze is created wherever you were before.Water is as hard as a rock, you can walk on it without a problem, ripples will be created when it comes again.Once time stopped while I was taking a shower and the falling water became like sand, but heavier.Letting objects go is also difficult, since when you let them go they may shoot away really fast whenever the event stops.Usually, I would have fun during this events, preparing stuff to happen after the event, usually breezes.The duration of the event is random, but usually just happens between 1 and 5 min.I started counting the events after the elevator incident.The longest it happened was 2 hours one time.Before it only happened sometimes a week, but now it happens almost every day.Sometimes 5 times a day.This was the event 246th, I was just walking near midtown, going to a conference.I was late so I used the extra time to get there quicker, stopping at the street corner (I never cross, since you never know when cars will be moving again), that's when I felt an air path.It went through the crosswalk.I felt the breeze going in that direction.I had to follow.I let Steve know that I would be late to the conference.I followed the breeze path to a river, three blocks further away.I became frightened when I saw the ripples in the river.Suddenly everything stopped again and I saw a shadow, crossing the river.It was coming on my direction.This time I couldn't move.
