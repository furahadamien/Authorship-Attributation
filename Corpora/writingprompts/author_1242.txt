I guess it would be fair to warn that this is not a happy story but I guess I do not necessarily care...It's not written too good anyway so...I attempted to write it as if it was in a diary of sorts, but it didn't work out too well.The "..."s were intentional.----------
*25 December 2017*

*10:57 PM*

Tonight's Guinness night, browisng reddit while the metadata of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is being downloaded.I pick up my phone and press the power button so the screen wakes up.11:03 PM... No notifications...

Not sure why I even checked...

Hah.. that picture of Em and the deer... for the 5th time today... and yet another Christmas post...It's just a normal day, why the...

*Phone vibrates*

I look down at the desk.A notification saying I got a message.As I take the bottle and take another sip I start tapping the screen, moving my eyes back up at the screen.Network buffering.With the corner of my eye I still see the watch of the lock screen... must've typed the wrong numbers... 28...09...1-Oh...I forgot I took off the password.I stare dumbfounded at the ... Swipe to unlock...I need to find a better lock screen picture.Unknown number.. "We wish you to have the most beautiful moments and a BLESSED CHRISTMAS.Yours truly, Mariana C. and Alex C."

... alright... settings... add to spam numbers... confirm.You too... merry Christmas.Home.I stare at  for a few moments... Good memories... Back when I'd leave early in the morning and come home late at night... tired enough to dream of the darkness of my eyes being shut as a computer terminal and swear while trying to fall asleep that the keyboard wasn't working... good times...I have to find a better home picture too.Network buffering...

Back to reddit I guess... 

*We had the best Xmas*

*Merry Christmas from Diamond City*

I take another sip...

One more hour... one more hour and hopefully it'll stop and everything can return to normal...

Network buffering...I pick up my phone and wake up the screen... No notifications... Why did I even check...

*A ring comes from the balcony, it's a generic Christmas tune which abruptly ends after a few notes*

That startled me...The lights have a crappy tune player... it broke quite some time ago but still comes back to life once in a while...I swear I turned the volume down... 

Green... orange... red... blue... beautiful lights, although the red and orange lights seem to be the strongest.Must have left it earlier when I wanted to... 

Video Paused.Oh.Better late than never I guess... Heard good things about this movie.Hopefully it'll be good...

*Phone Vibrates*

I swear if it's another "wrong number" message...I pick up my phone wake up the screen.It's Ana.I pause the movie.I was wondering where she left earlier.Hopefully she is okay, the story she was telling was quite interesting."Hey.Sorry for that, my phone crashed and was stuck like that for hours.I was actually thinking about you so yeah...I probably made you sneeze.Had to hard reset it."That's not good...

"Hey.Did you lose anything important?"*Send*

I take another sip of beer."Mhm :))) 

Everything.Lots of memories."Oh... that's a shame...

Well... "you should take it as a challenge.You should have fun and make new ones, try up fill up your phone more than it was before"

*Send* 

"I do not have the time for new memories.Besides that, some things you can't get that.Different times, different people.By the way, I know what happened recently and I'm sorry but I think"

*My hand starts shaking*

"we should stop talking..."

I take a bigger sip of beer...

"... we both know that you only started talking to me again because of what she did and while I think you are a wonderful person...I can't.Not after last time when you didn't listen and just went back to her"

...of course... should have known this would happen... 

"I understand.Well....I wish you a good night and I hope we'll keep in touch"

*Send*

*Message seen*

...or not...

...my eyes are burning... my eyelids feel heavy...I'd probably cry if I had any tears left...I drink the other half of the bottle...

*A Christmas tune comes from the balcony, made out of basic notes*

...I look at the source of the bloody noise... the light installation I put on the small tree... every single one of them shining either a bright red... or orange... 

...and a single green light...and reach for it...

*The green light slowly fades away, and the Christmas tune cuts abruptly*
