I've done it.I jumped.Nobody appreciated me my whole life long.But now... this girl.Small and fragile like a deer.She smiled at me, I smiled back."Why, thank you.Nobody has been that nice to me in centuries", I say whilst trying to think of an explanation.So I sit down at the tiny table between a bear plush and a wooloo toy.She is wearing a little plastic crown and it suits her.This detail gives me the idea for a nickname."So, my princess, what kinds of goodness can you present us with at this fine evening?".My heart is melting.She beams from ear to ear about this name and gives me the choice between sparkle green tea or unicorn dream tea.How did I end up here?Wasn't I supposed to be dragged through the seven gates of the underworld right now?But now I'm sipping on an empty cup and pretending to like it.The door opens and a person steps in.My immediate reaction is to get away from the table, raising my arms to show I didn't touch her.But that man just looks past me.And then it strikes me.The words of this girl now haunt me forever."I had tea with my toys and mister dream".
