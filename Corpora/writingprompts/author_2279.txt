It was so boring.Number 201 and it's only 179 with a monotone teller.But at least I'm meeting Bill later, we decided to catch up after these 3 years.The door opened and a two people jogged in.One sneezed."Bless you."I said automatically, barely glancing at them before realising with a start at the proximity of a gun, pointed at me."Thank you."I was suddenly held in a painful chokehold, forced to stand up, metal on skin.As I struggled to breath in the already humid air, the alarms went off."HAND OVER THE MONEY!""GET DOWN"

"I'M GOING TO SHOOT HER, I'M WARNING YOU!"Maybe it was the panic.Or the blaring alarms.Or the air.But I just COULDN'T BREATHE.I holsted up her arm and bit down hard on her hand, staggering out of her hold.She screamed and pointed the gun at me, 

"BITCH," but then she paused."OI BITCH!YOU CALLED AMY LEE?"How-

"FUCK THIS, JO GET OUTTA HERE!"she screamed, holding her injured hand."WHAT?""BILLY WILL KILL US."And she sprinted out, followed by Jo, who quickly changed his mind upon seeing my face and cursed.What.What.The alarms kept blaring and then the police and ambulance came.A teary eyed teller asked me if I was alright, holding my hand and escorted me into the arms of two ambulance workers."Shock..."

"There was...gun..."

"Hey...HEY!"I came to in a shock, looking into sympathetic eyes."Are you injured?"I shook my head."Alright, here, have a blanket and sit down.Can you tell me your name?""It's Amy.""Alright Amy-"

"AMY!"A man in a dark jacket rushed through the door and hugged me.How did my brother know I was at the bank?"AMY!Are you alright?""She appears uninjured, just in shock.""Oh thank goodness."He kept hugged me, patting my head.It's strange, I've never seen my brother in this jacket before."Alright I'll leave you then."The ambulance worker said, already looking at other victims."How did you know I was here?"He finally lets go and I see an unfamiliar face."Because those shitheads said your name over the mic.I'm going to kill those fuckers for hurting you."-----
I didn't really follow the prompt but oh well, it was fun writing this.
