if you can speak in tongues, message me.we're stuck here.there is no multiplicity of languages.we're all being lied to.encryption algorithms encrypt plain english.&#x200B;

if you can read and write english, you're most likely human.&#x200B;

if you can't understand other people, its just the AI trying to divide and conquer.&#x200B;

there haven't been multiple languages for more than a century.&#x200B;

message me if you can read and write english.you are not who you think you are.&#x200B;

gotta go
