Death speaks to us constantly.150,000 times each day, death feeds on us; the smacking, rending, shucking of the soul from the body accompanied by a whispering that never ends.We think we can't hear it, but we do.Deep in the hindbrain, somewhere very close to the spine, we can hear it.We think our egos can't hear it, and we're right but we're also kind of wrong.Like a dog pricking up its ears and running from a tornado that hits an hour later, our lives are spent sprinting from the known unknown.That's just for us, of course - we *special humans*.Death shows no such restraint in the animal kingdom - there among the carnage, death laughs loudly and joyously, and its sound is 150 decibels played through an iphone speaker forever.But for us, death whispers.Sometimes, like 70 years ago, Death raises its voice and a terrible, terrible language is spoken to those who would hear.But usually, it's a low murmuring as death goes about its business.This is because, lately, we've been escaping from Death more and more.We have begun to see it coming from the distance, like gazelles spotting a low-moving lion across the savanna, and bolting from it, leaving Death standing bewildered in cancer wards and warzones wondering how we got away this time.We have begun to understand the killing fields it prepares for us, and we bypass these ambushes while Death waits in vain for us to stumble in.Some might claim it's foolish or prideful to find satisfaction in this - that Death has always been the top persistence hunter on earth, that it always feeds in the end - but they do not understand.Death thinks of the future too, and it can see that one day we may finally escape to the places it cannot go.There is a sound in the act of creation.A sound beneath a sound in a baby's first wails, or a seed splitting open, or a cell dividing.A sound that we hear too, calling the dog to shelter from the tornado.This is the sound that Death fears.
