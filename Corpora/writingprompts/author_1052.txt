Twelve years ago, as I sat on the Mt.Everest, that I have climbed for the fourth thime, I got lost.Inside.Depressed.I felt a black hole inside myself, feasting on my everlasting success for years.I hardly rememberd where I actually started from.All I knew was there were two lines, a green, which I followed blindly ever since it helped me score with the girl I used to like back when I was twelve, and a red one, which I never trusted.Now, the green line gave me everything.Things that I didn't even knew I wanted, nor needed, some of them I didn't even know they exist.But they exist, just like everything I own, and all of the things that I own and have done combined could not fill the hole they produced...But the red line... Once I saw it's entire length, as it was rather short.Didn't follow it couse it would take me straight into a car crash.Never trusted it since.I saw it as the devil's line.But then I thought, fuck it.I've done everything, seen everything, achieved everything that was good for me.But never the bad things.That's why the green line was my curse.Nothing but success renders life rather pointless.So, again, fuck it.That day, as I climbed down from Mt.Everest, I followed the red line.It took me back to our mountain camp, then the second one, then the third one.Took me straight down from the mountain, to the dirt road going back to Kathmandu.At Kathmandu, it took me to the airport, where it took me on a flight to Shanghai.When I got off the plane there, the red line took me straight to McDonald's.Never ate there before.I just had my fourth pacemaker installed today.
