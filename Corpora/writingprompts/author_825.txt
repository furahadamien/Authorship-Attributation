Well, it wasn't easy getting to like them.But it's a tangled web we weave.Back in the day I used to put spiders outside instead of killing them.It was a habit I got used to.I guess as I got older I also turned into more a pacifist... maybe trying to make up for all the nasty things I had done in my youth.I would mumble a little prayer and toss the little bastards off into the night.My castle seemed to be littered with them.Felt like a magnet for the eight-legged.Maybe it was all the torches outside, attracting all sorts of bugs and the like.I don't know.All I know is today I heard a crier bell swinging loudly in the early morning.There was talks of a large squadron of Barbarians coming through the foothills, plundering all along the way.I gathered my few men, what several I had, and had them armored.I was to go out with them at Dawn.We started our crusade down to meet them.But as the sun began to rise I noticed a strange blackness still enveloping the countryside.It seemed to almost shudder and breathe.Then at once I saw the Barbarian horde on the distance.They were quick approaching, bearing steel with clenched teeth.All of a sudden, the blackness of the countryside moved with frightening speed, followed by hundreds of thousands of spiders through the castle behind me, and within a minute there were bloodcurdling screams of girlish terror sung into the early morn.The barbarians flee'd as quickly as they had advanced, dropping all weapons and belongings in their stead.I shuddered at the thought, but then remembered my old prayer...

"Today you, Tomorrow me."Tangled wed indeed!
