No, you absolutely cannot keep it, my mother said with a look on her face that told me that negotiation was futile, that puppy has a whole life to live. 

I knew she was right, she always was.My mother is a know-it-all, because shes all-knowing, and shes incredibly controlling, because shes the creator of everything.But Mom, dont you feel that?This one is special!When will you ever let me keep one? 

I had tried this on her with many earth forms before, but this particular one felt different.Overflowing with unconditional love and beautiful, positive energy.The brightest parts of infinity.Of course I feel it, honey.I created this puppy.But I didnt do it for us, I did it for someone else.A family on earth who is in need. 

I began to cry.I know, I know, she began to rub my back, some day you will see this puppy again, after it has changed earth for the better, and someday later than that you will take my place and you will understand that we have all the love we will ever need right here, because we are eternal and infinite, just like the love inside this little Shepard.

I knew she was right.She always is, because she always is.Go on doggie, go toward the light, I shouted, bring them love!Ill see you someday soon!

The little dog barked in understanding and disappeared into the shining tower of infinite light.Im so sorry to hear about your dog, but nothing can take away the beautiful memories and all the love that a pet brings with it.
