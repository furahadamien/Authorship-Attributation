I was finally there, at the top of the world.Around me I could see all of my journey highlighted in green, culminating in this moment.After soaking it all in and feeling quite pleased with myself for awhile, boredom slowly crept in.I started glancing at the red line and wondering its destination.I resolved to follow it to the end as the green line had helped me so much.Standing and taking the first few steps reminded me of being twelve and first choosing the green line.The sense of wonder returned as I walked down the path.While daydreaming of my first encounter with the green line the red line led me off the path.My last conscious thoughts were a spinning whirl as boulders and sky repeatedly switched positions.You hear a booming voice reading "You have died.To choose the other path turn to page 92."
