*This place sucks.*

That was all Yuki thought when she walked through the doors of the office building.The work was mundane and easy, so long as she refrained herself from throat-punching her co-workers.Most all of them were annoying as hell, though Yuki didn't blame them.At one point, Yuki was sure, that these people were all full of life and hopes, considering this place a stepping stone in their path to greatness.Now, they were trapped and dead in a place being run into the ground.Her nose crinkled as she nearly gagged on the coffee.Cold and somehow gritty.She glared at the old machine.Everytime she or Shiro bought and "donated" something to this shitty ass place to improve the lives of it's workers, somehow it always ended up "missing", replaced by the shit predecessors they had thrown in the trash."God-damned bitch..." Yuki hissed under her breath as she marched down the hallway.She motherfucking knew Brenda was taking the shit home, she just couldn't prove it because the security camera's here didn't work because who the hell cares about office safety, right?As she rounded the corner, she saw Riley standing rigid guard at a conference room.She arched an eyebrow, as usually he was down on the bottom floors patrolling, considering he was the only thing between them and someone who would want to cause the occupants here harm...It made her wonder why he was here.Azalea, Brenda's primary receptionist, popped her head out.She let out a small gasp, then grabbed onto Yuki, stopping her from going to her cubical.Yuki arched an eyebrow as the blond darted back inside, only to come back with her brother."Shiro told me he wanted to talk to you as soon as you got in."she spoke simply, opening the door wider to let him out.In the conference room, Yuki heard and saw loud sobs.Briefly, she saw a rather famous co-worker sitting in the corner sobbing into her hands.That took Yuki by surprise, Maddie was like the class-clown of this office, always finding a reason to joke and smile, thus her current state was... worrying.Azalea shut the door behind them, cutting them off from the scene.Riley gave them both a stern stare, hurrying them to move along."You know how Maddie's been worried about her sister's medicine?"Shiro's voice dropped to a whisper as they reached the handicapped bathroom, locking it tight so they'd have a moment of privacy to talk."They just cut off her health insurance.""What?"Yuki hissed under her breath."That's completely...It's supposed to be provided by this place!They can't just take it away!""Rosario and Erik are trying to calm her down enough to get the full story, but that's what it sounds like.They've been cutting back on privileges for months and months on these people and this is the last thing they can take away before they drop us all down to minimum wage."Yuki knew this, deep in her heart.While the changes never personally effected her or Shiro, she heard the worries and vocal complaints around the office.First it started with Riley not being reimbursed for fixing the camera's out of his pocket.Rosario and Azalea getting half-hours cut from their paychecks.All of them wondering where the hell their bonuses went.Shiro looked at Yuki, and she only nodded once.Shiro was already on the phone with Raven, discussing donating as much money as possible to Maddie in order to secure her and her younger sisters wellbeing for years to come.Yuki had exited the bathroom to go back to her cubical, only to have a full on screaming match going on between Erik and Brenda.Well, more like Brenda was screaming at Erik and he couldn't be more than bothered to listen."Look at this place, it's disgusting!What are you doing canoodling with your coworkers when you could be making this place at least *look* decent!"She kept going on, freshly manicured hands flying in the air as hairspray and perfume wafted off of her like a desperate cloud of attention.The poor woman was hideous and in her late fifties but was doing her best to look like she was twenty one.It wasn't working."He isn't a janitor, you idiot."Brenda whirled around so fast that it was a wonder her implants didn't go flying off."What did you just call me?""Nothing."Yuki rolled her eyes, continuing to walk away.The lie was obvious and half the office was snickering or at least trying to keep their act together."Don't you walk away when I'm talking to you, Yucky!Yucky!"Her voice rose a shrill higher as she mispronounced her name a second time.Yuki barely kept her cool as she made it to her cubical, until...

"*YUCKY, YOU ARE FIRED!"*

The shrill scream caused the entire floor to go silent.Slowly, Yuki turned to look at Brenda.She was visibly sweating, red in the face, and look ready to burst at any moment."Mind repeating that?"Yuki asked.Surely this *dumb bitch* didn't just say what she thought she just said.Brenda suddenly put her shoulders back, standing tall and proud as she lorded her so-called "power" over her subordinates."Yucky Smith, you are *fired* from this corporation.""My name is *Yuki Shoda."* she hissed back, trying to figure out if she mixed up her name accidentally or on purpose."And are you *really* sure about that?""Of course I'm sure.I don't need this much *toxicity* in *my* work environment."Brenda then turned on her heel."Besides, what could an *intern* possibly do?"She then left the scene, laughing like she was a villain who had just vanquished a hero.Yuki gripped the edges of her desk in rage, only to turn and leave.Whatever was in there, she could buy new anyways.As she descended the stairs, she started to laugh.What could an intern do?What could an *intern do?* Oh, Brenda had no clue the hell she's just unleashed."Raven," Yuki barked into her phone, barely able to contain her laughter."So get this, I got *fired.* This place was a shit hole anyways.So here's what I need you to do.Riley Meyers, Rosario Hart, Madeline Hatter, Erik Zeph, and Azalea O'Connor.I want all them working for me and Shiro before the end of the day, within close contact.Not even outside the city.Pay them whatever they want, be persistant, I don't *care*.Make sure they aren't working for her anymore.After that, dig into Brenda.I want *everything.* And I want her life *destroyed."*

It didn't take Raven long to follow through.Already, Yuki was getting information about Brenda's husband running off and demanding a divorce in favor of a much more pleasant high-school flame.Yuki would make sure Brenda lost everything in that divorce, no house, no car, no nothing.She wouldn't even get to keep her cat that she adored.Yuki had detailed information about her being addicted to pain pills and how she got them.Oops, terrible shame, the doctor she shopped at suddenly got cut off.Oh, another botox surgery scheduled this weekend?What a *shame,* no more health insurance.For good measure, Yuki decided, she'd cut her pay down to minimum wage.By the time she was done fucking around with Brenda's life, she had already gotten an excited, desperate response from Maddie and a confused text from Shiro.Yuki smirked.She'd take this company and the best employees, then put them in the right spots, where they belonged once Brenda was gone.*By the end of the month, we'll own this building and make it what it should have been.*

Yuki sent the text to her brother.She'd let the dumb bitch keep her job for now, no point in completely destroying her yet.She's wait a week *then* start leaking information about her laundering and abuse of employees to the higher ups."What can an intern do?"Yuki chuckled under her breath as she watched Brenda's husband march into the office, lawyer at his side and papers in hand."A fucking lot, you stupid bitch.A mother fucking lot."
