Oh how much the world can change in just half a year.The great kingdoms of mankind reduced to quarries for the Dwarves to build their fortresses, the sacred groves and forests of the Elves nothing more than kindling for dwarven forges.Noone knew just how it had begun, how this could have happened.Countless tongues cried out to their gods and heard no answer, scholars buried themselves into fruitless discussions, one more outlandish than the other... and the Dwarves conquered.More and more and more, with unending vigor and hunger for victory.Thrrustan, 'The Ascended', still lead them onwards with a triumphant grin on his face.He had been the first.The first to ascend.To become more.To realize the full potential of dwarvenkind.Whatever he had done to his people: They had changed, for better and for worse all at once.The differences had been subtle at first, unnoticable to an outsider, but they had spread through dwarven society like a wildfire.Their charming mumbling had disappeared - now, dwarven mouths everywhere gave orders in a cold, harsh language and with painfully precise pronunciation.Their were faster than ever before, scaling buildings and crossing plains with equal ease as if something had set free even more power  in their stout physique.They were tireless now, their cities brimming with the sounds of forges and soldier's boots day and night without pause, as if they had lost all need of sleep.They were merciful overlords.A year or two passed and the reckless conquerers settled down again, ruling over their realm from sea to sea, undisputed and terrifying in their might.But all was not bad for elves and humans: The far-famed dwarven ale was generously distributed among their long-legged subjects and gave them something to look forward to after a hard day's work while their overlords feasted on whatever game they desired - and paired it with the only drink reserved for their noble palates: Pure dwarven spring water from their old home underground.
