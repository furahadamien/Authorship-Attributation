That alarm.That damn alarm that everyone hates.So loud, blaring with such urgency that rouses anyone from their sleep."God what, what is it now?"Isaiah questioned.The amber alert sound was still unending, and as he turned to unlock the phone and silence it, he was met with the brightness of the sun in the palm of his hand."Augh dammit!Why are phones always so bright!?"He shouted with frustration.After a minute of struggling, he managed to turn off the text alarm."Amber alerts, hmph.Like anyone is going to be a hero and run after little sally or something...hm what's... Do not look at the moon?"He talked to himself, like he always did at home.A simple quirk that helped him think.His alertness rose however, when he started scrolling through the hundreds of random numbers that texted him.It was 11:30.Now he was fully awake.A couple lights turned on in his home revealed the pigsty that he lived in.With forward thinking, he turned off the living room light.As if on cue, there was a knock at his front door.Thoughts raced through Isaiah's head, some were pure panic, some were decisions on fight or flight.He lived alone, miles away from civilization."It's a beautiful night tonight."The mysterious voice said."You should come out and look, friend."Isaiah was a paranoid individual, and the panic button on his phone helped turn off all the lights in his house and double check that all doors and windows were locked.He sat on the edge of his bed, struggling to keep his hands and his nerves steady.In one hand was his phone, scouring the internet for any source of info as to what was happening.In his other hand, his pistol that he always kept close by.It was now 11:50."It's a beautiful night tonight."A now different voice said, in conjunction with the first.In stride, seventeen other voices said at the same time "You should come out and look, friend."It sounded like they were circling the house, chanting the same phrase and shuffling their feet.Isaiah retreated to his panic room.The cacophony of varying voices outside hadn't entered his house, but he wasn't about to give them the chance.The metal safety door slammed behind him, locking in place.The panic room immediately illuminated, various screens springing to life and giving him a view of the outside.Every single person outside stared at the cameras, knowing he was also looking at them."What the hell is going on."He stated, almost insinuating that he wanted an answer from the mob outside.The soundproof room sheltered him from the horrifying phrase that followed his statement, but the movement of lips on screen already gave him his answer.He turned off the screens with haste, the clock on the wall reading 11:59.The motion sensors on the wall were no longer activated.Isaiah breathed a sigh of relief, looking over at the dark camera screens and pushing buttons."C'mon man, this has to be either a really cruel prank, or another one of my bad hallucin-" His sentence was cut short.Mouth agape, his pistol made a loud clanging sound against the metal ground as he walked backwards and trying to brace himself against anything.The camera monitors showed the grass around his home trampled on, but no mass of people.It was midnight, but outside was a brightly lit hue of colours.
