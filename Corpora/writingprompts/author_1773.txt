BrutusTheQuilt
High in the timber-shrouded hights of the Guinness Crags a light snow fell.A crescent moon shone through the clouds like the Great Lightstick of old.All was silent; all was dark; all was deathly cold.In a quaint stick hut nestled in a dell upon the mountain-side song and laughter hid from the cold in the light of a crackling fire.Many people danced and made merry in a circle around the old shaman Arthur as he spoke in an alien tongue.At length the man of the book held up his hands."Stop!"he cried."The consecration of the altar is complete.Let us begin."With that they went to the table and began their work.Its surface was smooth and dark; many twisting wires wound like snakes from a protrusion on its back.Red, green, and yellow, they seemed color-coded for some forgotten purpose.Sparks still danced upon them during snowstorms.Upon the table's top they laid sheets of prepared wood-pulp.With sharp stone knives they cut, with sure hands they folded; a slice here, a crease here.With strings of animal gut they tethered the sheets together.The storm outside grew louder, the winds harsher.Grim thunder sounded forth from the sky.The sparks danced along the wires of the table.Many of the coven were struck down by the wrath of the angry Gods.A hard glint appeared in Arthur's eyes, and he began to chant again.Of fire and water he sang, of earth and wind he told.He spoke of sorrow, and joy, and days passed away.The shaman reached the end of his song."Step back!"he cried.When the table was clear, he gently lifted the frail dart shape with both hands.He looked at the Book of Guinness upon the mantelpiece and gestured."There it is, my friends," he told his followers."The greatest 'paper airplane' that ever the Gods made."Constructive criticism much appreciated!
