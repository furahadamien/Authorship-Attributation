At first I thought it was some sort of "dormant powers coming to light" kind of situation.I'd record what I was doing just before time froze and then try to recreate it to see if it could happen again.This eventually got worse as I would try to recreate hours, and then days at a time.Thankfully I realized that it wasn't anything I was doing and managed to stop myself before it became an obsession.Nowadays I try to go with the flow whenever the Pauses occur.Sometimes its a couple of seconds, which only serves to have me trip over something that's suddenly stopped in front of me.Other times it's been upwards of three hours before things resumed and, during those Pauses, I try to get errands done that don't require some sort of live or active interactions.I can't play games online since the servers freeze, but I can go and grab groceries.Before you crucify me for being a thief, I've made it a habit to leave some cash behind for whatever I take.It may not be the FULL amount, but I aim for 75% at least.I've tried finding out who it is that Pauses everything, but I haven't had any luck.There hasn't been anything on the news about miracles happening around the world, aside from the usual fluff pieces, and there haven't been any segments about rampant or elaborate crimes.Far as I've figured?Whoever it is that's causing these Pauses is just using them to make life a bit easier for themselves somehow.No need for me to go on some crusade to hunt them down when they haven't done anything to deserve it.
