The weirdest day.Where to start?First, my job went missing.What I mean to say is that, the entire building where I work was just...Missing..And before that, my car wouldn't start.Which meant I was going to be fired (after months of depression and missing work, they made me sign a zero tolerance policy for being late).So I was almost relieved when the taxi driver was driving like a maniac.I swear... We were going to hit that bus straight on...

.And now, knowing what I know about things like Quantum Taxis and peanut butter not actually existing, that whole day makes sense.Alan, Selma, Qth'blorthrox, and Jim...They'd been preparing for this day for years.Maybe my whole life.Or... All of my lives, as it were..Now, that first day seems as boring as a 1pm math class in eleventh grade, when you know you *might* go to community college..Where was I?Oh.Yes.So, there I was, hotdog in hand, wondering how to explain to the plump, and increasingly annoyed Filipino lady at the unemployment office that, "No.My company did not go out out of business.It went missing", when I heard a cry for help..I acknowledge that you don't know much about me.And as it turns out, God, most of the Universe, and especially the citizens of the 'United Totalitarian Societies of Anti-Life and All That Stuff' also don't know enough about me, but at that time I was not the type of person to answer a cry for help originating from a darkened alley..Especially with a half eaten hot dog topped with ketchup, mustard, and sourkraut (I never get sourkraut, but it had been a weird day, and I decided to try something new for the first time in... ages)..But, whether by for-ordained design, or because a rather menacing fellow in a trench coat was lumbering towards me, I decided to quickly hustle down a darkened alley that I normally would not have entered, wielding only a hotdog and recurring depression as my weapons of defense..Anyway.Sorry.I get distracted.I was always a poor storyteller, but it has gotten terribly worse since I stopped existing.Which is getting ahead of myself.Ok.

Alleyway.Gun.Wallet.Yeah..So there I was, unknowingly stepping into a dimension that can best be described as kind of "Shitty Greyhound bus stop in the middle of nowhere, but you are still worried about that stray dog across the street with an obviously fake limp, so as to gain your sympathy", when I saw a man crouching in the middle of the alleyway, in-between your standard London trash bin (which was strange because I lived in Chicago), and a rather menacing cascade of old cardboard boxes leaning against a nearby wall (whom I would come to know as Selma, the love of my life)..... Um...?Oh.Right.Trench coat.Drawn gun.Darkened alley.So there I was, with just a hotdog dangerously cooling toward that temperature where the tepid greasy taste really becomes noticeable, and my "infinite ability to save the universe, and everything else that has been and ever will be", when the man in trench coat stood up and asked for my wallet..And to be honest, I had very good reasons for not giving it to him.Not that the man in question had any nefarious look to him, nor any apparent weakness that gave me courage.His face was unremarkable.His trench coat somehow gave the impression that he could be really fat, but you almost second guess yourself and think you saw a couple layers of clothes that are probably making him look quite a bit more fat and you shouldn't think of portly people in such of a negative tone of voice, even if it is in your own head..He was neither tall, nor especially short.And even now, after knowing him for easily 10 trillion years, I couldn't pick him out of a lineup at a police station (not that lineups, police stations, or 'everything that ever was or ever will be' exists anymore)..I didn't know it at the time, but I was really resistant to giving my wallet to the best friend I have ever had in all of the lives I have ever lived (which is really saying something!).And I had a perfectly good reason why I did not want to give him my wallet..It was that all-powerful combination of a "cherished object from childhood that you're also embarrassed to admit or show to people now that you're an adult"..The same quantum-emotional psychic energy that powers the war-machines of galaxy-spanning empires, as well as really fueling those awkward moments at a party you decided to host in your (a little too small for a party that you didn't think anyone would really show up) apartment and now you regret letting people into your bedroom because it was too crowded in the combined living room/kitchen/laundry room..My wallet from 5th grade, actually.A faded and patched up denim wallet, with one third of an autobot logo decal clinging to it like a person on the verge of suicide.The kind of person looking at a 'Hang In There' kitten poster and trying to think that as clich as it is, this poster was put there by God, for them, right then and there.Which it was.You're *WELCOME*..The kind of wallet that you found the courage to go to the house of the bully who took it from you after school and ask his dad, (who really should be at work and not drunk at 2:30 pm), for your wallet back..The kind of wallet where that cool skater girl who was heartbreakingly intelligent, but also so deeply codependent from her dad's inability to show affection that she would date awful "cool guy" jerks like Taylor Rathmussen until her mid-forties.The kind of fun, authentic person who could turn your social anxiety on a dime, because she thought it was hilarious and awesome that you still owned a denim wallet in 11th grade..So, you can imagine my resistance to giving up such a treasured and embarrassing item to an unassuming man, while we both stood in another dimension that was doing a poor impersonation of a dimly lit alleyway..Plus...I was holding a half-eaten hotdog that was at the aforementioned critical tipping point between "delicious" and "fucking gross, what are you, some kind of pig?God...I am a total pig".Which is widely accepted as the only two states that hotdogs can exist in..But as he stood up, I noticed that he had a light pink pastel chalk in his hand, and I retroactively noticed that he had just completed a drawing of a gun on one brick from the cobbled (British, not Chicago) back alley street..A perfectly good drawing of a six shooter pistol you would draw as a kid.Complete with all of the wobbly lines along the length of the barrel, and an oversized pistol grip that you would come to expect with a young child's drawing..And upon spotting the drawing, I was filled with such dread that I immediately shoved the hotdog in my mouth (I am not one to waste money, even on a hotdog that had become gross and God I am such a pig) and handed my treasured, yet embarrassing wallet to the nondescript man in the trench coat..And so filled with dread I was, (dare I say even more dread than when the end of "the Universe and everything that was and every will be" , was about to happen), that my brain felt much more relief than incredulity when he nonchalantly turned, cocked my wallet like the two dimensional drawing he was about to fire upon, and fired upon the drawing of the two dimensional pistol with my wallet until the entire drawing was eradicated from the face of the brick..Looking back, it seemed like such a weird day.But I was a different person (thing, entity, God of gods, recently-unemployed depressed man) back then.Just about the only normal thing that day was the moment right after the nondescript man in a trench coat finished killing a two dimensional drawing of a pistol with my treasured yet embarrassing childhood wallet in a inter-dimensional bus stop posing as a darkened British cobblestone alley in a minor Chicago side street..The moment when he handed my wallet back, put an uncomfortably presumptuous hand on my shoulder, and smiled when he said,

."Hi.My name is Jim.And I just want you to know that we've been the best of friends for a long time"..Which was weird of him to say, if you ever get to know the man.==============================
