Innodence
*My eye trained through the glass as I took a breath.*

"Aaaaany time now..." *I muttered, tapping the pressed trigger over and over, trying to stand still.*

*the butterfly sat on the flower, it's proboscis curled out.My camera work had been reveled as some of the most variable in quality.A lot were shaky, even amateurish.But every once and a while, it would happen.At first I thought it was me, and that I'd been given plato's ring of invisibility.But the timing was never great, so I started thinking myself defective or something.But then it's always about taking the opportune angle.Finding the little gems.*

*I took up incidental photography.I got some big breaks in it too.Finding little shapes or accidents were always fun.*

*A hand patted me on the back and I looked up.*

"You get a good pic?"*She asked.*

*I gave her a friendly grin.*

"Gotta wait for the film to develop!"*I chuckled.* "it's a bit old fashioned, but it works.I'm Harrison.""Hannah."*She knelt down and shook my hand.* "what were you taking a picture of?""Me?Oh, just found a butterfly here on the flower, I may have caught it's proboscis on the tip of the radio tower."*I shared.*

"You've lost me there."*She raised her eyebrows and shook here head with a smirk.*

"Not... actually on the radio tower, just in line with it."*I corrected.*

"That's actually pretty cool."*She conceded.* "how do you find such scenes?""It's a lot like life is, you know, it can be really ugly, or scary, or sad sometimes, but there's more sides than just that."*I shared.* "you just gotta look at it from the best angle.""No shortage of charm on you is there?"*She sighed with a sincere smile.*

"*Wow!* you're not mocking me?"*I cocked an eyebrow.* "most folks end up calling me corny or something-"

"I mean it."*She nodded with a laugh.*

"*Wow!*" *I emphasized.* "I hope I'm not to forward in asking your number?""Certainly!"*She lit up before starting to stutter a little.* "I mean, as in it's not too forward, I came up to you after all."*She pulled out a business card and handed it over.*

"Real fancy!"*I complimented,* "*Wow!*"

"Yeah!"*She giggled.* "Anyways, I gotta make a meeting, but please!Call!""I will do that Ms." *I checked the card,* "*Hannah Rotterdam*.Here let me get you mine!""Oh no, I trust you'll call!"*She insisted.*

"You sure?"*I pressed.*

"Yeah.Yeah.You can tell me all about your photography when you call, maybe even show me the results when you take it.""Definitely!Yeah."*I nodded.* "I'll call you then!""Alright!Well, I'll let you get back to it!"*She stood, starting off.* "It was nice to meet you Harrison.""You too!"*I gave a smile as she walked out of the park.*

*I returned to my camera reaching to reset the film to the next one.The butterfly sitting peacefully on the branch.*

"*Wow!* you hear that little guy?"*I commentated.* "I got a potential date!"*I looked back into the eyepiece at the proboscis in line with the radio tower.The shutter blinked as the photo finally took.*
