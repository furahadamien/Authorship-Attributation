"In 1972, a crack celestial unit was sent to purgatory by an atheist court for being the justification for a pile of crimes they didn't commit.These men promptly escaped from a maximum security cruise ship to the Jerusalem underground.Today, still wanted by the government, individually by various religious organisations, and some very pro-active marketing departments they survive as soldiers of fortune.If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them....maybe you can hire The G-Team."*Jesus "Nailer" Christ*
