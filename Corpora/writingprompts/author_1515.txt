I pushed the ghost into the pentagram with my phantom arm.The one that had been crushed in the car accident and then amputated.The ghost looked shocked that I had caught hold of her and then began to rage against the invisible walls of the pentagram as I began chanting the exorcism.Her tattered Victorian dress billowed as she tore at the air.As I uttered the last line of the incantation, she vanished with a shriek.Another one bites the dust for good, I muttered to myself.My next job was going to be in New Orleans.Most people think of ghost hunters as a TV show about people trying to figure out if a place is haunted.Im a real ghost hunter.I use my phantom arm to catch them and then send them to whatever comes next.I do believe there is an afterlife because the day I lost my arm, I almost died.I saw a white light and felt a sense of peace come over me.The paramedics stopped the bleeding in time to save my life but not my arm.As I was recovering in the hospital, I would feel pain in my absent right arm.The nurses said that was normal.When I said that I would sometimes feel things touch my phantom arm or brush against it, they just gave me a funny look.It wasnt until I got home that I realized what was going on.A week or two after I got out of the hospital, I was sitting at home feeling sorry for myself and trying to figure out what to do with my life as a one armed man.I couldnt work in construction anymore.I couldnt go boxing anymore.I couldnt practice sword fighting anymore.I sat staring blankly at the swords mounted on my walls wondering what to do with my life.At that point, I would still forget that I didnt have a right arm and tried to use it to grab my drink from the table.Instead, my phantom hand grabbed a cold, clammy arm.Suddenly a voice shouted, Let go a me ye specky cunt!  

I let go and a ghostly figure appeared before me.He was barrel chested and wore a tunic and kilt.He scowled at me as I gawked at him.Seeing that I was not going to regain the ability to speak anytime soon, he launched into his story.He pointed to the claymore on my wall and told me how it had been his when he was run out of Scotland during the Clearances.Callum (that was his name) had come to the states to make a life for himself away from the English bastards.As he was winding down and I was getting my voice back I asked him, But how did I grab you?  He looked at me and said, Well yer arm is dead so noo ye have a ghost arm.  

Since then, I have been using my ghost arm to be a ghost hunter.I have a job and a purpose.I get to travel around and meet all kinds of interesting people both living and dead.And I still carry my claymore around for company.
