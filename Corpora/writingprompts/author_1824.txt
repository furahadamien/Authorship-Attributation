The sun danced on the rolling waves.Soft once.And once again.Ever another wave, but not so the days of the Man.Salt lay heavy in the air, as it always did in this Place.There were many Places, but this was a favorite of Magi - because it always seemed to make the Man calm.Other Places lifted the Man high, like the mountain rock did, or put Him on edge like the stone paths where the metal boxes rolled.Or made Him curious and cautious, like the Place of the tall wood and leaves.But this Place - this warm, gentle Place - here the Man always stopped and simply Was.As it should be.Magi lifted his head.Man, I am here.You are here.The sky, the water, the birds are here.We sing the soft tones of the passing Sun.I am here with You.I am here for You."Good pup."the Man said.His Hand was not strong on as it rested between Magi's ears."You're a good ole pup, boy."The Hand fell away.The wind lifted, carrying the sound of birds out above the sandbar a ways off from the Place where they sat.They were raucous creatures, those birds.In times before, Magi would run along the water's edge, chasing the loud ones - scattering them to the sky - and the Man would laugh.But not so today.Today, the deep laughter that had filled the Man's years was run dry.Gone, leaving only the sand exposed at the water's edge by the ebbing tide.But still, while the laughter had faded, there was yet a sense of Being.The sun touched both their faces, the deep blue stretched far above, and warmth rose up beneath them.It was good.It was a good Place.It was good way to end the time of the Man.The sand at the water's edge dried.The birds called to one-another.Magi lay down, resting his muzzle on the Man's hand as it cooled in the fading light... and watched the waves come rolling.Once.And once again.
