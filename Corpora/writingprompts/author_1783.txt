Mom grabbed the shotgun and I grabbed the remote detonator.We had spent the last 10 years preparing for a potential assault.Mom was no Green Beret like dad was, but he had taught her some survival skills that she insisted on passing on to me when dad disappeared.The plan was whoever was picking the lock right now would get a face full of buck shot, and if there were more behind him, mom would fire some suppression and then we'd use the back door to escape outside.Once the intruders had entered the home, I'd blow it to bits using the simple C4 bricks mom had set up.Dad hadn't taught mom that trick, she learned that one all on her own.His disappearance had made us both paranoid.Whatever.Before he vanished, my dad could definitely beat up your dad.Now, my mom could.All that mattered was that I felt safe.Until now.The door's lock clicked, disengaging.It slowly opened.Mom trembled, but kept her aim fixed on the doorway.Then, her eyes showed recognition and confusion all at once, and she fainted.The shotgun fell to the hard wood floor with a thud.My heart sunk.I had no idea what she saw, but our plan was already toast.Mom was down.Had they hit her with a tranquilizer?Was there a silenced bullet?My mind raced at what to do next when I head a familiar voice carry through the door."Linda!"shouted the voice, and then, for the first time in 10 years, my dad ran through the door to my mother.I stared in shock.Mom and I thought he had been kidnapped by his political opponents, taken to some cabin in the woods and killed.That was a sure way to stop the young, popular war hero from making the general election, after he had obliterated the competition in the primaries.But here he was, in the same jeans and flannel shirt he had left in years ago when he went to buy cigarettes from the 7/11 on Main.Dad picked up my mom and moved her to the couch in the living room.I rounded the corner slowly.It felt like I was being compelled to move toward him, like a magnet.My legs were moving, but I wasn't sure how, since my brain had been left on the landing."Dad?"I said.He looked up at me and I saw those familiar walnut eyes, and suddenly my brain rammed itself back into my head."It's really him!He's back," my inner voice squealed with glee.It was not the voice of 17-year-old me, but 7-year-old me.And I had just found something better and more elusive than Santa Clause in my living room.I found my dad.Tears fell from my eyes as if someone had opened a dam somewhere.Dad looked at me confused.But then his face turned soft."Jason," he said.It wasn't a question.He knew me, even though I looked so different now.I had grown up.He saw the detonator in my hand, but he didn't say anything else.He just reached out to me inviting me in.I put the detonator on the coffee table and ran to him.He drew me in with his right arm and held me while we both cried.\---
