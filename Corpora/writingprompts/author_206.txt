It's surprising how quickly you adapt to the dark.At first it was a disaster, people wept and raged and died in droves, but it was barely two years now since the world went blind and these days, things are almost normal again.Nikolai came out with their new self driving cars, fully optimised for their sightless passengers, meanwhile Pear and Congo got together and trained their voice assistants to better help us get around.Honestly, with technology being what it was, the blindness barely made a difference.Still, sometimes you almost felt like the darkness was bearing down on you, a pressure and oppression that became so constant you barely noticed it was there, like that slight ring in your ears in a quiet room.There were fewer people too, I think my office only has 17 employees, including myself.Apparently it had more than a hundred back when the blindness first hit.I arrived at work today, like most others, and set about navigating my way to the dictation cubicles.Nick, my old friend from high school, bumped into me along the way.He seemed... perturbed, like something had worried him.I questioned, but he just spattered something about work stress and left.He was in such a hurry, he didn't even bother following the guide wires.It wasn't until later that day that I saw him again, I was heading for my car when he asked if he could hitch a ride to my place to discuss work.Obviously I didn't mind, these days company was about the best entertainment available since TV and video games mostly faded away with our sight.We got home and made our way inside, I could tell Nick was nervous and his anxiety was starting to rub off on me.>I gotta tell you something

I inquired, but he was hesitant

>Swear you won't tell anyone!Literally.LITERALLY!Nobody.I agreed, laughing nervously at his insistence.He stood up and faced me, before muttering;

>I can see again...I laughed it off, sure he could, very funny, what colour shirt am I wearing?He didn't seem to think it was funny, and repeated himself.It was annoying me now, he was lying, obviously.He couldn't see, nobody could.He kept going on about stupid messages on the wall.There were no messages, he was just attention seeking.All this for a laugh?He kept rambling, trying to find ways to prove his lies, I wasn't listening any more.What was wrong with this piece of crap?He came into my house and starts this bullshit?The world felt hotter as he ranted, why won't he just shut up about this?What's wrong with him.Shut up Nick.I found myself breathing faster, the weight of the dark was annoying me, it was like an itchy jumper and Nick just...Kept talking!I told him to shut it, he asked why I was standing, why I was scowling.How the fuck does he know what my face looks like?What nonsense trick is this?Why is the air so fucking heavy!?He can't see nobody can fucking see what the fuck is wrong with him shut up seriously shut the fuck up just get away just fucking stop stop stop fucking stop this I hate it I hate you so fucking much just burn burn in hell hate hate fucking die already

Honestly I barely even notice the blindness anymore.About the only change I've noticed is there seems to be far fewer people.I remember a busy world when I was a kid, but these days my whole office only has myself and 15 other people working there.Still, it's strange, sometimes, when I wake up of a morning, I swear I see the faintest glimmer of light.I wonder if my vision is starting to come back?
