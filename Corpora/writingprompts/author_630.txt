They met when he was thirty-four, and she was still seventeen -only with seven extra years worth of wisdom.They loved each other even more passionately than they despised the rules the government had put in place, because meeting someone his age, at this time, and still falling in love knowing you'll lose them; well, that's real love.For a while, they both accepted it.She knew that if she lost him then she'd kill herself, and she'd prefer to do that later rather than sooner.So, they married, and joined the last generation of lovers who'd be separated by death.But, the years flew by for her, and she only noticed them in him.The promise of death constantly nagged at her mind, but the chance of an eternal life with him gave her endless hope for the future.She set a plan in motion, and worked to save their lives.Fifteen years later, she earned a position working in a building that administered the death cure.Not working directly with the cure; The government didn't trust those who still had close ties to the lost generation, even after they'd divorced to increase her chances.He had hated going through with the divorce, but she didn't care.Laws and norms meant nothing to her now, all that mattered was the endless love she chased.With amazing difficulty, she stole a dose of the cure and saved them both.She was sure to be wanted by the authorities by now, and his appearance was well-aged and would eventually become a dead giveaway, so they left their society behind them and started a new life.They found peace in the wilderness, and started their endless life together.Every day they loved one another, and, somehow, their love managed to grow even stronger each day.Their life was passionate bliss, and they knew it'd last forever.Then, one day, she couldn't get out of bed.She hadn't been sick in decades, and he looked back to society for an answer.They hadn't used the old radio for years, and when it crackled to life, it brought death.All around the world, people were experiencing the cure's only side effect.She'd soon start to lose her mind, and eventually her life."Kill me.." she'd said after hearing the news, but he couldn't.He knew he was being weak, but he could never bring himself to do it."I'll stay with you until you're gone, just like you would have."He stayed at her bedside at all hours, barely sleeping or eating; and she laid there, loving him as passionately as ever, slowly going mad, and as did she, so did he./r/BeagleTales

He was unsure of how long he'd trekked across the barren world; for in this realm, time seemed to fade like the memories of his long extinguished life.It was certainly his world, the trees and mountains stood as they were, streams and rivers flowed endlessly on, but life had seemingly disappeared from the earth.Missing was the buzzing of the bugs by the water; gone were the predators and pray of the thick wood, and no matter how far he walked on the still earth, no trace of life could be found.On he walked, never tiring, never growing hungry or thirsty, but trapped in an unchanging, undying land.He forgot the sound of wolves howling in the night; he forget the touch of another living thing, and he forgot everything he'd ever known about himself.His mind slipped away, releasing him from all preconceived notions of his own reality, and, staring up at the frozen moon, he stepped out into the air as if onto a gradual hillascending into the void.So he walked for an eternity, never ceasing, never veering to left or right, until at least he felt like he could reach out and touch the moon's glowing surface.In a flash of light, everything changed.*Life*...It was everywhere again, peculiar lifeforms that he did not recognize but was so immeasurably happy to see, and he fell to his side and wept.Scores of creatures approached him, lifting him up and comforting him."You have travelled far, but your journey is over now."an angelic voice whispered to him."But what is this place?"he shuddered at the sound of his own voice, it was unfamiliar to him."I can remember again.My life, my family, *everything*..."

"This is where all souls come when they leave the physical realm, once they find it."He looked around, still puzzled by the strange creatures, "Are there others like me here?""No," the voice said."You are the first of your kind to die, and so you are the first to find this place.""But I didn't find it, I was lost..." 

"Ah, but you did.The moon has always called to you, hasn't it?And you finally answered the call.""So long I was spent wandering, I forgot everything I knew.""Sometimes we must forget if we wish to find our way."He was elated to be with life again, but he could not shake his sadness away, "More from my kind will die, and they will wander as I did?""Yes.""Then may I go back?""We are all free in this realm to do as we choose, but why?"the voice asked, but it knew the look of longing in this creature's eyes."Because I know the way, and I know what it's like to howl at the moon alone."He turned away from the light, back towards the darkness, and stretched out his long legs, wagging his tail happily as he ran.____

I was tipped off to the location of an abandoned school house near the edge of the city.The kid who gave up the information wasn't exactly cooperative, at first, but a few days off of pixie dust had him itching so bad that he gladly told me what I wanted to know for just a little sprinkle.Addictive stuff.Like nothing the guys at the lab have ever seen, and they've been no fucking help since this all started.A case like this takes real cop work, dirty work, and that's the kind I prefer to do alone.I sprinkled a bit of the stuff on my head after three weeks of dead ends, evidence is loaded with this shit, and what's more, it doesn't weigh anything, *literally nothing*, so they have no way of accurately keeping track of it anyway -it won't be missed.Sometimes you gotta think like a crook to catch one, and that was my philosophy here; but, to my surprise, the pixie dust had no effect on me.I practically shoved my head in the damn bag; *nothing*, but these kids are flying high like fairies off this shit.Maybe it only affects the youth?What kind of animal develops a drug that only works on kids?It's raining cats and dogs outside, but that's to my advantage.The constant patter of rain hitting the old metal roofs suppresses the sound of my engine as I roll up to the old school.I keep my lights off as I pull off the side of the road and park the Jolly Roger behind some natural cover.She's seen better days, and if I get any closer her rumbling will surely tick me off, but I know she's here and reliable if this goes south.I make my way towards the schoolhouse, staying close to the tree line, and I can make out lights coming from inside.Nothing electrical, as far as I can tell, definitely fire.There's a few kids hanging out under an awning near the flag pole at the front of the school, the glow of a couple cigarettes illuminates them enough for me to see their faces, and their weapons.*Knives.* One kid is theatrically flourishing a butterfly knife while the others coo excitedly; *moron*, easy way to lose a hand.One of them knocks a beer bottle off the old table, and I use this as an opportunity to move quickly towards the rear of the building.The rain is keeping up, and there's quite a bit of noise coming from inside, so I'm not too worried about keeping quiet now.The old building is tagged up with red, yellow, and orange spray paint.Various symbols and words are plastered around, but one thing is repeated often: *LB*.Looks like there's a stairwell around the side of what looks like a gymnasium, possibly rafter access, I won't get a better opportunity to do some surveillance.I suppose I could call this in, but then what?Have this place raided, and all these strung out kids killed in a firefight?Not that I think they'd send em anyways, that pussy Smee has been telling everyone to steer clear of this since the beginning, and I suspect he knows something we don't.I'm up the stairwell now, and as suspected, there's easy access into the gymnasium from here.The windows are fogged up, but I can make out a ton of movement inside by the low light.I open one enough for me to slide in, and close it behind me.It's a damn circus down there.The place is packed with kids, and they're all high off their asses.There's a few massive fires going at both ends of the court, and smaller flames are scattered about elsewhere.A few kids are perched up on the basketball hoops, dumping pixie dust down on half naked children dancing around in ecstasy, they're smashing bottles, fighting, and doing things to one another that are well beyond their immaturity.However, nothing compares to what's going on at half-court: A large circle of kids, surrounding what looks like a duel.Two older boys are engaged in frantic swordplay, dancing about with wondrous flair as they strike and parry.There are dueling chants amongst the crowd as well, each rising and falling with the swing of blades.***RUFIO, RUFIO, RUFIOOOOOOO!***

***PAN'S THE MAN, PAN, PAN, PAN!***

That's him!The one in the tight green pants, *Peter Pan*.I saw that name repeated countless times on the reports I'd snaked.This is who everyone is looking for, and he's just a kid himself.But the way he moves, the way he fights, I've never seen a kid do these things.There's no way I can break this up on my own, even with the gun, and I'm definitely not taking those little bastards in a sword fight.I make my way back to the window and try to push it open.It won't budge.I give it a good shove, but the damn thing flies open as the wind catches it and it shatters.All the noise below me ceases, and I sit as still as possible in the dark of the rafters."Lost Boy?!"I don't say a word, and just as I'm about to make my way back out of the broken window, a voice creeps up from behind me in thin air."Hmmm, I don't remember inviting any grown ups to the party?None I didn't want to kill, anyways."I whirl around with my gun drawn, and right there before me, literally floating, is the boy in green: *Peter Pan*.I'm stunned, how the fuck is he doing that?His leg rises up in a flash, and my gun is soaring through the air before I have time to think."Only a grown up would use a coward's weapon like that!"The kid grabs me by the throat, and suddenly we're flying through the air and quickly descending towards the middle of the dueling circle.The bastards all have their weaponry held high in the air, and its all glistening in the fire light.Pan lands on his feet while somehow still holding me up off the ground by my neck; *damn he's strong!*.The mass of kids ring out.***BANGARANG!***

"What do you think, Rufio?Pirate?"Pan smiles at me as he inquires to his associate, who lurks out from behind me and settles next to him.His eyes and skin are dark, and his hair is wild and red."All grown ups are pirates!"He's walking around the edge of the circle, sword held high, "And what, *Lost Boys*, do we do to pirates?!"***KILL THE PIRATE!***

Pan releases me and I plop down on the hardwood.I'm up like lightning, still some fight in me, and I throw a punch right at his smug face.Of course, he ducks it, and my momentum has me back on the floor with dozens of blades trained on me."Well well!"Pan is excited now."This one's actually got some fight in him, hasn't he?!"The kids erupt in a sound which I can only describe as a rooster's crow."I can respect that, old man.So, I'll tell you what: We're gonna let you go!"Cries of disappointment ring out all around, and I can hear them making fart noises in disapproval."Now now!That's not to say he won't be paying his price.We need to give him something to remember us by, so if he ever comes back, he'll hopefully come prepared to offer us a *real* fight!"The kids crow like roosters again, and Pan grabs me and spins me around.He's holding both of my hands down onto the floor, and I can only imagine what they're about to do to me."Take his hand, Rufio, our prize, and his incentive to come back and reclaim it!"Rufio steps out in front of me, and he's now wielding a dull looking axe.He lines it up with my right hand, preparing to strike, but Pan interrupts."No!*The left hand.* That's the one he was holding his piece with."***BANGARANG!***

That little fucker.If they let me go then they're making a mistake, because I swear this won't be the last time they see Captain James Hook.____
