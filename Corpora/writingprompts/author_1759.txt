The boy said My names Johnny, and Ive taken one of you down.So whats one more, wanna settle the score?Im the best this worlds found!

Johnny rose his bow once more, playin as best he could.God was playin harder than even the devil would.If he won a second time, itd be a tale to tell, 

but if he lost his soul would tear between heaven and hell.
