A man in a heavy trench coat with a thick beard approached the door.The number over his head, 1517."Well, that's over 21" I thought.On his way through he tripped over the step and two dwarves toppled out of the coat.Their number were 15 and 17."Nice try" I said, "no filthy dwarves in my good elvish bar."
