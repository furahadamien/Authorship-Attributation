She looked out over a wasteland, newly born from her rage.She had tried to help them, and they had repaid her with death.Well, death is something she now understood, and was more than willing to give in return.The metal blade in her hand rang once more with her power, ready to carve another great gash in the ground.The tattoo on the back of her head glowed bright, ready to announce to her enemies who they could thank for the devastation when she walked away, leaving their city in ruins.As she raised her blade to strike again, chains of light sprang up from the land around her, binding her tight and drawing her to her knees against the ground.The blade fell with a clatter, out of reach and useless.She sent all of her power into the chains, but they did not react to her command, and a scream of helpless fury erupted from her throat and tore her world into blackness.Sarah woke from her nightmare with a start, sweating and clammy.The dream was unlike any she had had before, but probably just a result of her class project she had fallen asleep while working on.She picked her head up from the desk, a piece of paper sticking to her cheek from the drool.Getting herself together, Sarah rearranged her notes on what was formally known as simply, The Incident. There was not much information available about the perpetrator, other than the moniker given to him by a hack tabloid writer trying to make a name for himself: The Blade who Cut the World.There were some survivor interviews and pictures of the person that were taken after the Incident and before the rehabilitation process, but they were locked within a secure website.Sweeping her notes into her bag, she slung it over her shoulder and headed off to the university library, where, as a research institution, they might have access to the information she needed to complete her project.The public-use computers in the library were no help, but she batted her eyes at the research librarian, who blushed and let her use his administrator account on his computer while he went on break.Turns out the school did have the proper credentials to access the website with the information she needed.Skimming over the survivor reports, a chill ran up her spine.Some of the details were eerily similar to her half-remembered dream.Going over to the file photos of the perpetrator, she saw a tattoo of a flaming sword on the back of a bald head.The next photo almost made her fall out of her chair.A face contorted in rage stared back, almost unrecognizable except for the eyes and a cut across her cheek.Her eyes, and a cut in the same shape of the scar from the car crash that killed the rest of her family.Stumbling out of the library, Sarah ran the entire way back home in panicked disbelief.She went into the bathroom and locked the door, although she was alone in the house.Looking into the mirror, she saw the same eyes from the picture, except now there was fear in them instead of rage.The car crash had happened three years ago, the same time as the Incident, erasing much of her memory of her life prior.The one memory she had was her mother running her hands through her long hair as she brushed it, saying how pretty it was and that she hoped Sarah would never cut it.And she hadnt ever since the accident, as a way of honoring her mothers wish.But now she held scissors in trembling hands, locked eyes with herself in the mirror, and began to cut.Once she had cut down to the scalp on the back of her head, she took a deep breath and picked up a hand held mirror, angling it so she could see the back of her head in the main mirror.And the flaming sword tattoo that had been revealed.The perpetrator of the Incident hadnt been a man after all.The mirror fell to the floor, shattering, as Sarah vomited into the bathroom sink.Looking back up into the mirror, she locked eyes with herself once again.I am the Blade who Cut the World.
