"Its just tombs Soft-As-The-Rain, if we scale up from what we've seen so far I'm guessing billions of them...I'm sorry.""We knew what we were likely to find coming here, stay positive and keep up the good work," 

Hollow words, especially coming from them.Hundreds of years from their obsession as a pouchling through to their rise as the dominant expert on the precursors, Humans.As they made their way towards the structure assumed to be the focal point of the entire installation they idly read the names written in an eclectic mix of languages, what else could you expect from them?Esperanto, Fujianese, here and there even some High English.They had died as they lived, fiercely individual yet curiously united.Again the sting of melancholy washed over them.Foolish, they knew it already when the transmissions had stopped billions of years ago, or even as the scans confirmed that Sol was now just a dwarf incapable of supporting life beyond the microbial.But here in their last mausoleum Soft was crushed by the truth that Humanity had gone.Caressing the gigantic tomb of one Morvehn Ach Kaifong they noted with some curiosity the mild heat; perhaps here deep within the tectonic plate heat from the core, the fallout from the cataclysmic last war, or even Sol's death bellows herself kept their bones warm a little longer.Light-Is-The-Palm grunted, they had reached the dais.The soldier and the rest of their squad had been on edge since they arrived, Soft believed Humans would have deemed it ironic that a killer would be so perturbed by the ancient dead.A touch screen they assumed, Soft took a moment to brace themselves, then drew a looping spiral that abruptly began to tighten, the golden ratio.Instantly the dais reacted, and it appeared.Their fellow researchers had often joked of them being a pervert, even broodmates had voiced concern over their obsession with the physical form of Humans, but what was before them now was undoubtedly perfection, even Light-Is-The-Palm seemed half bowed in deference to the glorious spectre.It towered over them perhaps three units in height, a hard light hologram of other-worldly androgynous beauty tinged in blue, a perfect amalgam of its creators cast in the mold of their ancient gods.The apotheosis of their physical ideals, unbearably erotic and intimidatingly athletic at once it turned to Soft, robes shifting in a way that suggested it would reveal the curious sexual dichotomy of Humans, and Soft's excitement redoubled.But then it smiled and all worldly concerns were washed away in that radiance."I-I am S-"

"Hello Soft, I am Prometheus"

They gawked, how could it have known?How could it speak Kresch?Sensing their confusion Prometheus threw back its head and laughed, every hair on Soft's body stood on edge with a terrible joy.This was what Humanity had been like, an overwhelming force, no wonder even the warriors among them were cowed in its presence.Apologies my friend for though I have not had the energy to speak back to you, rest assured I have been listening and eagerly awaiting your arrival.Let us begin properly then, with a formal introduction: I am Prometheus, Ghost of Humanity, Keeper of The Sleeping, Teller of The Past, Custodian of The Last Hall, Eternally Bored, Heavyweight Champion of The World

It bowed deeply, then winked at Soft.Pleased to meet you,

Finally regaining control Soft replied in kind with a curtsey.You are bipedal too, isn't that a coincidence.But enough!Down to business, time is short and it has already been untold millennia, what would you like to know Soft?

Sitting down on the steps to the dais, it motioned for Soft to join them, and the guard retinue to do the same.There was a brief crackle of static on the comms, but Soft waved impatiently at Light to join their ancient host.Apologies, I haven't quite been able to maintain this place as it was from my birth.Your surveying friends may run into obstacles from time to time, but nothing a bit of walking won't solve,

Soft still struggled to find the words, they had expected books, records, unspeaking words.This they could deal with, to be greeted by a walking talking simulation of Humanity, possibly their last ever creation, was too much.I hate to rush you my friend but you do not have much time, and the years have made me impatient for conversation.Do you know I managed to solve Chess?100% win rate as long as you move this one knight, not to brag or anything but I had to frag Stockfish CLXVI when it started getting depre-

Soft looked once again at the rows upon rows of the dead, and spoke timidly.How did it end?

Prometheus' face was suddenly filled with a sadness that almost brought Soft to tears, hunched over it seemed to shrink in size almost exponentially, a pathetic shadow of what it had been before.Gazing at the tombs Prometheus paused for a moment and then began.The story of humans is one of struggle.What more could you expect from a terrestrial species on a planet that is more than 70% water, water we can't even drink!To be more specific I suppose our first struggle was against the creatures around us, we were smaller then, and weaker.We did not have the strength of our cousins or the speed of our enemies, but we did have our cunning.So in time we overcame them, and in time those who had once devoured us begged at our feet for scraps, and those who would destroy us from within simply ceased to exist.

At this the hologram seemed to regain some strength, sitting up it returned to its former glory, its eyes an iridescent gold, filled with pride.Our next struggle was against Mother Earth herself, for in our journey to glory we began to hurt her, and as all worthy beings must she fought back.In this we were forced to compromise at first, taking what she could give us and doing our best to give back, but we could not bear this dominion for too long.So we grew once more, until we did not need her gifts or fear her retribution, and she was tamed.And that which we permitted to remain was there for our amusement only.

Soft felt a little colder and looking around the rest of the retinue seemed to share the sentiment, Light still had their finger worryingly close to the trigger.Humans, for all their beauty, seemed to have a few similarities to the Alvissaq of The Far Rim.Perhaps it was just how they phrased things, nothing too much to worry about, besides only a fool fears the lessons of the dead.Soft turned back to Prometheus, eager to hear more and was filled with a new fear as the eyes they met were now deep red.Grief or anger?It was impossible to tell.Humanity's final struggle was the fatal one.The struggle amongst ourselves.We achieved so much  together, but still remained irrevocably apart.In times of plenty and desperation, without fail we would always turn on each other.Perhaps at the beginning it was understandable when the resources  we could access were finite, yet even as we grew past this blood continued to be shed.What happens after death?Who is superior and who is inferior?Who should be allowed to love?All these questions and more increasingly could not be solved by words, only with our hands at each others throats.And so it was Humanity died.

Silence descended over the strange group, weary travellers listening to the words of a failed god.Each of them though how the Kresch could have easily fallen to the same fate in the Great Schisms of the past.Soft ventured to break the oppressive gloom.It is truly a shame that w-

Another burst of static, louder this time.Light looked worried, had their warrior's ears picked up something an academic could not?I'm not finished.

Soft dared not turn back to look at Prometheus, instead watching the growing fear on his companion's faces.As the Pillars started to rain down and the New Plagues spread, our philosophers gathered one last time to see where we had gone wrong and what lessons we could leave for those to come.And there we realised our great mistake, to regard ourselves as essentially alone in the universe, to focus our thinking on how humanity acts in regards to itself as opposed to others.In all our great struggles we had succeeded through domination, and in our cosmic solitude we turned that desire for conquest upon ourselves.The truth became clear, we were necessary in the grand order of things, an apex predator in the universal cycle.We had just been spat out to early, left to cannibalise ourselves in the afterbirth of creation; to this revelation some responded with despair, but we stood firm with new resolve, we decided to wait.

Light was screaming something, in equal parts to Soft and to the survey teams over the comms.The troops started to form a circle, panicking as they scanned the shadows between the sarcophagi.Something was coming.Those chosen of us settled down for our long slumber, while the rest of the fools shuffled off into oblivion.Waiting, patiently waiting, for the rest of the cosmos to catch up and bear fruit.

Prometheus laid a hand on Soft's shoulder, and with a jolt they realised it was far more solid than even the most advanced hard light constructs; a fact confirmed the other hand casually separated Soft's head from the rest of their body.Brought face to face one last time, Soft noticed just how sharp its teeth were, how close set and predatory the eyes sat, shadowed under the brow so only violet points of hunger shone out.So my friend we come to the end of my tale, Humanity did indeed perish.Unfortunately for you, Humans did not.

Soft's senses finally cleared, they heard the desperate screams of the surveyors, tasted the acrid burn of wild pulsar fire, and finally with growing horror saw the tombs begin to open.
