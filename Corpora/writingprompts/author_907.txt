The first time it happened, it freaked me out.The 100th time it happened, it had become just a part of life.By the 200th time, it had become an unbearable nuisance.Everything stopped.And I mean Everything.People, cars, animals, machines, phones, clocks.Time froze.The whole world stopped except for me.In the early days I would try and take advantage of the situation.If I was waiting in line at a cafe, I might quickly jump behind the counter and snatch a sandwich or a cake.I also raided a few cash registers.Not my proudest moments.It occurred to me that i was robbing small business owners who were simply trying to pay their bills.Fortunately I had the moral fortitude to stop this stuff fairly early on.The problem was that I never knew when the phenomenon would occur, or how long it would last.I contemplated bank robbery.If I could sneak in while time was frozen, surely I could make some easy money.Unfortunately the random nature of the phenomenon made it almost impossible.Plus there would be too much electronic security to overcome.Nothing electrical worked.I was initially surprised that lighbulbs stayed on, but then I guessed that there were probably already electrons in the filament, so the light was already being generated.If I was watching a movie I had to wait until everything returned to normal before i could continue.It was the same if I was gaming, or checking facebook, or browsing reddit.I assumed it was because the phenomenon was affecting the entire physical universe.Maybe electrical signals were unable to traverse circuit boards (this was my theory anyway).I couldn't even play solitaire on my phone.My only option was to wait in frustration until things returned to normal.At least I was beginning to understand it.Some things would still work.I was able to exert force on objects.For example, I could open and close a car door.I could turn the steering wheel.I could even turn the ignition, but the car wouldn't start.I assumed it was because the spark to the fuel was frozen in time.I could also move other objects, including people.I had much amusement repositioning friends and enemies into humorous positions.I hate to say this, but I also copped a few feels.I'm a young, red-blooded male and I took advantage of some motionless, unsuspecting young ladies.Again, not my proudest moments.Sporting activities were interesting.I had been trying to get a handle on surfing.One day the phenomenon occurred, freezing the wave and board in place.I tumbled off the front of the board and the water moved around me where I landed.I was able to swim to shore, but  the water had thick and sludgy feel.One time I was having a hit at tennis and the ball froze in mid air.As an experiment, I hit it with my racquet.Sure enough,  it flew off in the direction it was hit.I had no theory of the physics behind that one.It happened one time while i was driving.The car suddenly froze while travelling at 80km/hr and I slammed hard against the seat belt.Lucky I was wearing it or I might have been killed.As it was, I still injured myself pretty bad.I started to get paranoid.I was becoming fearful of leaving the house and interacting with others.I hated driving.I bought a bicycle and began riding everywhere.I considered it phenomenon-proof.If time froze while riding, the force of my legs pushing the pedals would still move the bicycle.This had been going on for almost 2 years.I tried researching the Phenomenon but hadnt found any information remotely similar to what I was experiencing.I was losing my mind.Was this alien interference?Could I have an implant that caused me to stop time?The idea seemed ridiculous, but how many plausible explanations could there be?I visited several doctors.I wanted full physicals and full checkups.I paid for two total-body MRI scans, hoping that an implant, or at least some kind of anomaly would show up.This would at least give me an answer.Nothing was found.This is when I started to consider that someone or something else was causing this.But who?The government?Aliens?I surmised that if I could control the phenomenon,  it would be the greatest gift anyone could ask for, instead of the bane of my existence that it was.I began watching all news channels and browsing news websites.I was hoping to find a pattern.Something, anything that would give me a lead.At least somewhere to start.For almost two years, nothing.And then one day something suddenly grabbed my attention.
