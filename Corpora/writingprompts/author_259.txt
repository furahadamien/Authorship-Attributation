*An excerpt from Stephen Colbert's award winning interview with Sergeant Major Johnathon Stewart- Veteran of the "Dead Contact War"*

Colbert: Whenever you're ready, please, tell us what it was like for you- an enlisted man- when the war broke out, and when the tide changed.John: Rocks.Everything began, and ended, with rocks.First it was rocks from the sky.In the early days of the invasion the aliens redirected asteroids onto a collision course with Earth.Not big enough to ruin the planet for colonization, but big enough to kill an eighth of our population in the first attack.No one is sure who said it first, but soon after we realized who was responsible we started calling them "Stoners".You'll never hear that in anything official of course, it was just something we started saying around the FOB- I'm sorry, that's Forward Operations Base to the layman.You can take the soldier out of the suck, but you can't take the acronyms out of the soldier.After the first wave softened us up, they started bringing in fighters.The Skipping Stones, or Skippers, were faster and more maneuverable than anything we had.in days they had shredded anything that wasn't hidden, lucky, or buried underground.And they never stopped dropping rocks on our heads.After the sun got blotted out by the smoke, sometimes the only light you'd see at noon was the glow of cities on fire.Two months in, and we were down to about five billion.So there we were.Out gunned, out matched, and morale was in the shitter.I went from a Private First Class to Sergeant in a matter of weeks because so many people above us had already been taken out.Whatever was left of leadership skipped right over the draft and went straight to conscripting anybody with two working legs and at least one arm and an eye.It was looking like the end times, and some of the religious nuts were into it.Wasn't long before you had crazies in the streets saying that we ought to surrender to what was clearly "God's wrath".Those guys didn't last long.Around the middle of the fourth month, the Stoners started deploying ground troops.Big fellas on four legs most of the time, two legs when they wanted to shoot you with those big ass rifles.But they were slow upright, like a bear.Covered in armor.White stuff that made us think that they were color blind, cause they would hide, but stick out like a sore thumb wherever they took cover.It was the only advantage we really had.And they realized about the same time we did that it didn't really matter if we saw them or not.Small arms fire had no effect on the stuff.So they abandoned subtlety and would just waddle onto the field and lay us out.We lost another half billion before the "Sense" kicked in.And finally, things started to turn.People started to have "dreams".They woke up and KNEW where they were massing troops.KNEW where they were storing munitions.And it didn't take much to confirm these dreams, because everyone was starting to have them.And of course we acted on them.I had my first "dream" in August of 2038.About four hundred Stoners were massing in what used to be Spirit Lake, Iowa, USA.I sent it up the chain of command they launched an offensive.We caught'em with the space trousers down.It was a Stoner hospital triage for the few that were injured.And we wasted 'em all.I'd seen about a hundred fire fights and never seen one go down.To watch 'em all die like that... it still makes me wanna cry.It was beautiful, and I got another promotion out of it.And we paid for it dearly.The Stoners retaliated with a fury.The asteroids picked up all over the globe.Stoner troops came in at twice the number they needed.Skippers swarmed around like clouds overhead.And in two weeks, the killed two billion of us.We were all ready to give up.Throw it in.Go to whatever god wanted us.And then somebody threw a rock.Private Jordan.Conscripted by the Army while scavenging in what used to be L.A.Skinny little seventeen year old white boy.Skiddish by all accounts.His unit got pinned down on the Northwestern front of Old Canada.Went to fire his first shot of the war, and his rifle jams.Then he realizes that he dropped his sidearm in the crossfire when he ran for cover.He looks up and sees a nine-foot Stoner standing over him, leveling a shot.He panics, grabs a rock, and chucks it as hard as he can right at the things chest plate.It should have pinged off and got him killed.Instead it shot out of his hand at what some egghead tells me must have been something close to the speed of light.It punched a hole right through the Stoner and blew apart the roof of the building behind him.BOOM!!!"Like God was beating on the biggest, deepest drum you ever heard."That's what I said when I told the Master Sergeant.I saw the whole thing.The jam.The Stoner.The rock.And, unfortunately, the shot that Stoner put through John's chest in it's death throws.Poor kid.He had just won us the war, and he never even had a chance to register his first kill.So.I looked around.Found a rock about the size of my fist.And the second I picked it up, I knew why John chucked it.It was like I was meeting an old friend.The first weapon.Just an old rock.And I knew that no matter how bad a throw I was, she would hit whatever I was aiming at.So I picked my target.Cocked back my arm, and threw that stone for all I was worth.Suddenly I felt like I wasn't just throwing a rock.I was hurling all my being at them.My love, my hope, and all of my sorrow.**Boom!!!**

Some nine or ten of them died when their comrade took the shot.One second they were there, the next they were all replaced with a glowing crater of slag.So I kept grabbing stones and throwing.Soon the rest of the unit was throwing.Quarter of an hour later, and the score was 14 dead on our side, and 90+ on theirs.We were alive.And now we had the the Stone on our side.Of course it took a while to catch on.No one believed us at first.We tried to show our superiors on controlled ranges, but the rocks just went as far as we could throw and plunked to the ground.Like regular old rocks.It was about intent.Need.It came to us when it was necessary.And even after enough of our superiors had seen it in action, it was hard to convince people to tell their men, "Hey!Stop shooting and throw rocks at them!Trust me!"But finally they did.With just over a billion people left, and scattered resistance fighting around the globe against an invading force larger than the original population of the planet.And there it was.We killed them on the ground, in the air, in the sea.And once we realized that there was no "maximum effective range", we shot them right out of local space.Soon we started putting communication together.Started regrouping and rebuilding.Ten years later and we could finally start to breathe easier.People started having kids and putting together schools.About five years after that, and you could see the sun through the ash clouds.Things were still cold and harsh, but it was over.I lost a lot of good friends.I lost my whole family, except for my cousin in Nebraska- she still lives with me today, we just... can't handle being separated again.A lot of families are like that still.But we made it through.And it was all because a scared little seventeen year old Private threw a rock.Yeah.It all came down to rocks.
