The German was at his wit's end, almost ready to throw away the canvas completely.Were it not for the man with the strange hair, it would have been one of hundreds tossed aside."Now remember what I said Adolph" the stranger named Bob said with his gentle voice.Hitler sighed, "There are no mistakes, only happy accidents."He remembered and replied almost robotically.Bob nodded, with his strange hair gently shaking.His brush working a nearby canvas as he hummed a wordless tune.Hitler could only stare at this oddity of a man and wonder *'How does he stay so positive?!'*

He wanted to know more about America, the country this man belonged to, but he always shrugged off any specific questions.The only thing Bob acknowledged was that previous attempts on Adolph's life were from people of his time and some set in Bob's future.Yet here this stranger stood, painting as if he was in his own studio.Despite his attempts to apply for the Academy, Hitler was turned down every moment.His personal life was taking a turn for the worse as well.More and more he was frustrated, angry, unhappy, and needed to vent somewhere.He found that place in the happy settings that he and Bob created.Wonderful trees, beautiful skies, a utopia, and one Adolph wished would be so in reality.Then one day, Bob was not at the easel.He stared at a nearby window looking at the populace below."I didn't care much to draw people."Bob broke the silence.Adolph was slightly shocked by this admission of professional weakness.Bob never admitted to anything limiting himself or Adolph, always encouraging that anything is possible.Adolph wondered if this was a test, "Yes they do require some extra skill compared to a happy little tree."He tried to smile as he replied.Bob turned to look Adolph in the eyes; warm but still distant, as though looking at something millions of miles away."Capturing the esscence of people is hard to do on paint.What matters is capturing the imagination of people as they look at your pantings *right there*."The man's gaze returned back to Adolph, taking his shoulder and guiding the young German to another room.It was filled with all of Adolph's past pantings, ones he thought he threw away.He gave Bob an incredulous look, "I threw these away!They are garbage!They are mis--"

Bob cut him off, "They are happy accidents.Merely pantings you haven't finished because you gave up on them.Just like how so many give up on lots of things and others."Grabbing Adolph rather roughly, he spun the man to face his previous discards."You left every one of these?Why?"Pointing to a random picture, "Because it was after your rejection letter?"Then another, "Because that one girl you like didn't reciprocate?"Another off in the corner, "Because you were so caught up in the details you didn't remember the heart of your creation?!"At this point Adolph's anger boiled, "YES YES and YES!All of them are failures.The Academy wouldn't take suchs sloppy details!**I AM A FAILURE!**" Tears almost forming in the corners of his eyes.Bob released his shoulders, the calm voice returning, "So who are you painting for?Them or you?Each of these paintings deserve a chance to be finished.That's art, that's what is missing, and that's why I want you to finish them."So the weeks went, Adolph Hitler consulted Bob Ross on every "mistake" he wanted to discard.Bob would offer advice on what could be used to improve upon the paintings.As they worked together, Adolph lost his resentment to society little by little and replaced it with his own pride on the art.It was later when Bob announced a public display at a nearby park, featuring Hitler's works.The presentation wasn't to the art critics, the Academy, or anyone of high importance to society.It was to the common man and woman.The beggars, the old, the Jews and the Gentiles alike.Some found his art interesting, some disagreed, others found it boring, but those that stayed grouped around him to ask about his styles.With each presentation, the small groups grew.Bob tried to show Adolph Hitler that every man, woman, and child deserves to see art.It wasn't reserved for anyone special.It was there for everyone to touch their hearts.As a result of these presentations he made waves, for good and ill, in the art world.Slowly Adolph was displaying his art in public or even painting on the sides of buildings in secret.All of this to show his audience, his *people*, that they had the power to choose what art was instead of the academies.Bob eventually returned to his own time, hoping that the swell of the audience would give Adolph the love he apparently didn't get in his life.As Bob noted subtle changes to the "present" he noticed that WW2 sadly still occured, but under different circumstances.Researching Hitler's life, he found that the young man was killed in WW1 by a jealous French prostitute.Apparently she was enamored by his successes and grew frantic in her obsession.This young Jewish girl killed him and herself in a misguided attempt to "be together forever".Bob Ross was taken aback by the news, or rather history, and looked at the masses of people in the library.Conflicted in his feelings.He prevented WW2 as he knew it, but at the cost of a young man and woman.Countless lives changed forever."I didn't care much to draw people."Bob broke the silence to himself, "People are too chaotic to figure out."
