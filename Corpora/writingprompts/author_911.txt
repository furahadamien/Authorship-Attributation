A teacher walking by.The popular girls talking at the side.Two seniors kissing near the lockers.And of course, the bully, Doug walking towards him with 96 of his teeth spread out.Barry was relieved when it happened again, for the 246th time.Yes, he counted because he was a total fucking nerd.Once in a while, everything stopped for a while, the perfect opportunity for revenge.When it happened, Barry would mess with teachers, the bully, and the girl who rejected him in second grade.It always happened at school.Hmm, what should I do, maybe take his pants off, and he did.2 minutes passed by, and then everything slowly started getting back to normal.Barry was still next to the bully when things started moving."Aww, man!How did this happen?"The teacher even made fun of Doug."Nice one, Barry" he thought to himself, "maybe you should celebrate on the 250th one."Then he left the hallway."What a douchebag, and these aren't even funny.Last time, the pranks were actually creative.""Yeah, you remember that guy?What was his name?Ah, Jim the salesman, he was great at this.""Especially that telephone thing, that was the best prank I ever saw.So when will we do The Big Stop on him Dr.Hoffman?""On the 250th, Doug, just like all the others."
