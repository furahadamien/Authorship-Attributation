It had been a few years now since the stranger with the even stranger hair had come into Adolf's life.Inexplicably turning up and taking an interest in his painting and wanting to mentor him.His calm demeanour had a profound effect on him.He saw the world in an array of colours now, ripe for embracing and spreading on to a canvas.When Adolf went off to fight in the great war his friend Bob constantly wrote letters and even sent a gift parcel of some paint.Adolf would drown out the shell bombardments by focusing himself on little paintings to send back.Bob would reply soon after with advice and a gentleness that helped Adolf through the war.When it ended Adolf was so happy to finally get home.Adolf was ready to get on with his life again but as he looked down at Bob, holding his hand as the jewish pair that had just robbed them ran away he could feel the light in his world fading."Bob!"He cried in anguish."Hold on!Don't leave!""Don't worry" Bob replied in his usual slow and relaxed demeanour."Gotta have a little sadness once in a while so you know when the good times come.Remember Adolf!Remember!There are no mistakes in this world, only happy little accidents!Be strong and keep painting........".His voice trailed off and his eyes blankly stared into space as he passed away."Yes..." Adolf sobbed."You're right!There are no mistakes!This happy little accident has shown me the true colours of this world and those Jewish scum that hide in our alleyways!"He gripped Bob's limp hand harder."I will keep painting alright Bob.I will paint this world red with their blood!I will fix the 'happy little accident' that God made when he created that forsaken race that took you from me!"He could feel the tears streaming down his face and realised he was standing now, arm held aloft, reaching up to the sky in reverence to his lord who he would now help to fix the mistake the Jews had left on the canvas of this world.He would brush over their existence and in so doing ensure that no one else will ever have to lose their guiding light like he had.He stared down at the body of his friend then knelt gently beside him."I'll do it for you, dear friend" he whispered.
