"We call them Ghosts."When the alien first mentioned the name Ghoosa, the ambassador was sceptical and confused.But as the alien explained a Ghoosa, he slowly start to realise what it was."Yes some people on earth believe in them and every few say that they have encountered them.I consider it a bloody superstition.I believe in what my eyes can see, my ear can hear and my hand can touch"

"But your eyes are incapable of seeing them.They are tripolatized and the Ghoosa exists in quarantine spectrum"

"Right.Then for me they don't exists" 

The alien who looked exactly like a human but with absolutely no hair smiled at the ambassador."But they do friend.And people do see them when your mental activity recalibrates for the hormonal surges"

"What?""Tell me human, when and where are all the tales of ghosts from?""I don't understand what you ........ Oh.Fuck oh. ""Yes human.When men are afraid, when the darkness limits the tripolatized spectrum or when the fog filters the white light.It is when all your ghost encounters are.The adrenaline laced blood helps the optic centre focus on what is unseen"

"I don't believe in bull shit like ghosts.I am a man of science" The ambassador was getting up to leave.He continued "Right if we can't see or touch them, why don't they touch us?""Oh they do.And you will know when they touch" the humanoid smiled while his eyes drifted behind the man.The ambassador suddenly felt a chill in the air, goosebumps appeared on his forearm and in his reflection on the windowpane behind the alien he saw his dead wife with her hand on his forearm.The ambassadors scream and the aliens laughter echoed out of the room as the guards rushed it.
