I uh... need some help.It may result in this entire universe being permanently frozen and/or deleted.Let me start from the the beginning.About... 20 years ago, on my tenth birthday I received a gift, "Oh you got a present big deal big shot."Yeah yeah, I get it, shut up.So, I got virtual reality goggles, they were the newest craze at the time, so I thought I'd give em a try.They weren't all they were cracked up to be, they made me feel sick, and they were in generally kinda shit.So I went on with my life as normal, went to college, got a good job, got married.There's just one problem.I don't remember ever taking them off.Faulty memory?Maybe... but I don't think so.So that's where you come in, it's been a very long time, I don't know how to quit the game anymore.So I need help, I need you to help me figure out how to get to the menu.Need help deciding if I even want to leave.And it may result in the universe you and I know being deleted.So, I leave it to you friends, leave and risk killing you all?Or stay, and live a lie for your sakes?
