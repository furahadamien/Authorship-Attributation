Lily, if I were to have continued my old work she would have been dead by now.Found by her friends and family.Would I have had her kill herself?I may have even had her get hit by a public bus.But that isnt the new me, now I have to make sure these people survive.There use to be so many people that I had the privilege of deciding their fate, most people would have been appalled if they had to do what I did.But now with a little over 200 people left on this planet I must keep them alive.My life depends on their population not dying out.Its been a few years since the bomb that wiped out 99% of the human race went off.At first I was continuing my job of killing people but I soon came to realize how weak it was making me.When the population had dropped down to about 50 I was barely able to keep my self in this realm.Without my help the humans were able to get a little bit more population and my energy has slowly returned.I am nowhere close to how powerful I was but I dont currently need to worry about disappearing.Ive had to make it my new goal to make sure these people survive as long as possible.The people know very little about me, they seem to react to my presence which I assume has to do with how weak I currently am.They gave me a name of life but if only they knew who I really was.Lily is my current target, I sense her life will shortly end but she is only 34 years old.I am not able to foresee their exact deaths but I can do a little bit to help them.I notice up ahead there was a few trees.I counted 4 people working on collecting lumber for new buildings and they were working on a huge oak tree.Lily was right in the path of the tree about to fall.As they nearly finished cutting the tree I made a very small root come out of the ground and trip Lily.She fell face first into the dirt and I felt slightly sorry about causing her pain.Ive grown soft since Ive taken this new role and I hope once the world is back to a stable state I can return to my old life.The tree fell with a loud crash directly above the spot Lily was going to.I heard a faint thank you as Lily got up and brushed off her knees.This is how my lifes been these past few years.Helping people and hearing them thank someone they cant see makes me feel sorry for them.Sorry that I was the reason all of this happened.
