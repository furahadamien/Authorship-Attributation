A_Boy_Who_Found_Fire
I found a star in winter's end that called me by my name -

For Death they say the world will spin, but seasons stay the same.I want my life to carry on, but humans fell too far,

And now that storms have come and gone

so few people makes life hard.It has become my mission now to carry on their way,

I leave them signs and signals just to get them through their days.These humans seem to think of me as relics of the past,

but now that food's no longer scarce

their happiness will last.For many years, some fifty two, we have not seen a death.And though my power wanes I have accepted this life's best.As my life has carried on these humans call my name -

they whisper god has come and gone

but Life shall stay the same.
