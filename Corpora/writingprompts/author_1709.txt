It was all chance.Some bullshit about all five of our Earths occupying the same exact space in each of our respective universes so that the concentric gravitational pulls opened some kind of wormhole.It appeared somewhere around each of our south poles.At first, interactions between us were limited, but friendly.It didn't take long for everything to fall apart, though.Those of us on Earth Prime can't even exist peacefully with ourselves, much less with FOUR other Earths full of people with the same exact problem.Once relations DID break down, it quickly became apparent that we on Prime were outmatched.They had freaking MAGIC.Sure, each of them were missing some "element" too, but that didn't matter when they could create impenetrable force fields, summon lightning, or create amazing constructs at will.Our southern hemisphere became the battleground.Antarctica, shattered.Australia, ravaged.Southern Africa and much of South America, obliterated.We couldn't stop them, so the four magic using Earths fought it out in the south, while we retreated to the north.That was 15 years ago.When I was young, my father told me that what people used to call magic was just science that hadn't been explained yet.It turns out, that was true in this case, too.The other Earths don't have science, because magic is natural on their planets.But, our scientists discovered that "magic," just like our "elements," water, earth, fire, and air, is just a compound of chemical elements from the periodic table.Different combinations of elements resulted in different "magical" effects.My name is Captain John Paul Woodard.My four man strike team and I are the first soldiers in the multiverse to ever be trained in combat using all five "elements."Our mission?Take back our Earth._______________________________________________________________________________________
