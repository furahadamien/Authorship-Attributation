At a glance, it was a barren planet.Indistinguishable from billions of other planets in the Milky Way.The first giveaway of something extraordinary was its radiation signature; way beyond the expected range for its class.Closer inspection revealed ancient structures.Another civilization that burned itself out.Still not that uncommon.But once a probe was sent down to radiodate the structures, an existential panic rippled across the galaxy.The species on this planet had reached its peak billions of years before any previously known intelligent life forms had evolved.The electronic devices of this civilization had long since decayed.However, above the floating wreckage of orbiting satellite fragments (and one Tesla) was the final testament to the human race.Shielded from radiation, preserved at near zero degrees Kelvin, its data structure was intact.The information was stored in a format to be read by any civilization.We have failed.We have failed our own interest, assuring our mutual destruction.We have failed an even greater calling.A calling to spread to the stars.To spread life and vibrance across the night sky.We were reckless.In our race to the future, we derailed.Greed, envy, and above all, intolerance, were our undoing.We were not worthy of the stars.Our world lays smoldering.In our final gasp, we choose to breath life into the aether.We spread packets of single celled life to the most fertile planets.May this seed a life form better than ourselves.One worthy to inherit the stars...

One by one, each warring races across the galaxy made a pilgrimage to Earth.To the genesis of their race, of all races.A common ancestry bound these disparate races together.A common threat, met by their progenitor race, served as a warning to would be warmongers.A golden age of prosperity rises from the fertile ashes of the humans empire, may they rest in peace.
