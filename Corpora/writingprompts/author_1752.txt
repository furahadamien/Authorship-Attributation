A young man down in Georgia, he beat the devil at his deal.He gave him a stare and beat him right fair and lord, did Satan reel  
  Now Johnny was a prideful man and he played that fiddle a lot  
  He played so hard and played so much the wrath of God was got  
  
  
  And God said, "Now look here, Johnny, you know that pride's a sin."But more than that, you're not top cat, now watch as I begin."He could smell that popcorn roasting, he could almost taste it too  
  The devil sat down on a stump and laughed."Johnny, you are through."Johnny stood between that pair and felt his luck run dry  
  No bit of a doubt, his luck 'd run out and now God would make him cry  
  
  Johnny, get your ass out of that place and hurry really hard  
  Cause the rapture's come to Georgia and deep shit's in the cards  
  If you win you've beat the father, son and holy ghost  
  But if you lose, my friend, then you're toast.So God opened up the heavens and said, "I'll start this show."Angels sang and kingdoms fell as he rosined up his bow.And he pulled the bow across the skies and it made a sound like bliss  
  Then a band of angels joined in and it sounded something like this:  
  
       
  
  When God had finally finished, Johnny bowed his head and said:  
  "I get it man, you're better than me, just please don't leave me dead."God just whooped ya.Run, boy, run!Devil has been watching, having loads of fun;  
  Chicken's still picking nice and slow  
  Doesn't know 'bout God, don't ya know?Johnny bowed deeper because he knew that he'd been beat  
  And he laid that golden fiddle down at the lord's feet  
  God just said, "Johnny, you'd best not do all that again"  
  "Jesus died for you--you son of a bitch--so stop it with the sins"  
  
  And he played:  
  
  God just whooped ya.Run, boy, run!Devil has been watching, having loads of fun;  
  Chicken's still picking nice and slow  
  Doesn't know 'bout God, don't ya know?
