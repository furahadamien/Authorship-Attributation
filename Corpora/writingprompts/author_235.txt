They called it The Great Blinding, a "historical" moment in human history.The world quite literally went black, figures and shapes slowly fizzling into one giant haze before disappearing into an inky vision of nothing.It took a while to adjust to, in fact many of us still had not adjusted to this new way of life.For two years crime rates plummeted to the ground, thieves could not see things to steal and murderers couldn't decipher their next victims.The world was oddly peaceful when no one could see.But then something changed.The nights silence would be ripped apart with piercing screams, loud, guttural cries for help rousing neighbors from their sleep and instilling fear into the hearts of even the most stoic.I don't know exactly when it happened, all i know is i woke up in the middle of the night, chest heaving and sweat running down my hairline.I was met with the sight of my bedroom wall.It didn't occur to me that  my sight was back, all i could think about was the trail of intestines nailed to my wall, pulsing as if still attached to a body.My gaze followed the twisting lines, my mind believing i was in a very twisted nightmare.My eyes fell upon a figure hovering in the dark, almost dangling from the ceiling.It wasn't until my eyes adjusted that i realized the figure was suspended in mid air, hanging from the intestines covering my ceiling.My breath caught in my throat as i recognized the face, it was my neighbor of many years, someone i had known before the Great Blinding, but instead of the sunshine coloured eyes i remember, all i saw were bloodied holes.His eyes had been gauged out, leaving behind tears of blood streaking down his dark skin, mingling with the sweat coming from his pores.The blood was crimson, wet and evidently fresh.When did this happen?Was it within the confines of my own home?Cursing myself inwardly i slowly reached to take out the earplugs nestled in my ears.I had began to wear them after the first week of screaming, but now i wished i had never wore them at all.Maybe i would have heard the answers to all the questions ricocheting around my head.I noticed he was muttering, sharp ragged breaths between each word.Then, suddenly, he began the scream.Veins popping out his neck as his mouth spat words towards me, foam dripping from his lips as he shrieked for me to look at the writing, to open my eyes as he no longer could.To never disobey the words.To not give them reason to hurt me.To never tell anyone.I stared at the crazed figure in front of me, my eyes watering in fear.Slowly, mechanically, i moved my sight to the wall next to him, dark red letters painted the words " **Don't Tell Them You Can See"**
