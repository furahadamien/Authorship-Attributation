"Wouldn't it'd be more fitting if Satan mounted the gun?"Buddha asked, in that same level of near disturbing calm that I had grown accustomed to as Jesus hopped Dukes of Hazzard style into the front seat of the Jeep we had set for our escape.Satan, already upset with having to carry an unconscious Amaterasu in his arms, hurried ahead to place the former captive in the back seat."Yeah.Please.I'd rather shoot something then be stuck in the backseat with a filthy Pagen."Jesus turned back to give his brother an incredulous look."Lucifer.Language.Also, I would feel more inclined to agree with you and Buddha if he wasn't such a good shot."As Buddha and I took our places, Satan rolled his eyes and pointed to the mounted gun."Like you really need to be a good shot with the monster we've got on this baby."I was getting ready to tell the others to stop their bickering, but the sounds of gunfire did the job for me.Well, only long enough for Jesus to focus on driving us away from the internment camp.Buddha's eyes stayed on the facility as the growing distance caused it to shrink in our perspective.We couldn't relax.These people wouldn't stop until all gods and their followers (or sympathizers in my case) were wiped from this earth."Seriously," Satan continued."Why all this trouble for a fucking Pagen?""Lucifer, if you use the 'P' word one more time, I'll-"

"You'll what?Tell Dad?You know as well as I do that He never gave a shit about them untill people went all 'Clash of the Titans' on us!""Friends?"Buddha attempted to interject, but the calm of his voice left him ignored."How dare you accuse Father of not caring?!"Jesus' voice began to escalate as he glared down his brother.Sometimes I think he doesn't spend enough time with Buddha.Also, you may think it unwise to look back while driving forward, but c'mon.It's Jesus."Companions?"Buddha's second attempt."Hmm, lemme think?Oh, I dunno.Maybe COMMANDMENT 1?!""Is this your envy talking?""Oh yeah," Clear sarcasm "I'm envious that Pops gave me a real job with actual importance while all you did was dick around for 30-somethin' years and die!""My job was very important!""Right.Getting people hammered and cursing fig tress sounds muy importante.""Comrades?"Strike three for Buddha."Father sent me to teach love!To spread peace!""Yeah, and to tell people that growing onions and tomatoes in the same field is a fucking crime!""Oh yeah?!And what do you do, huh?!""Punish murderers and rapists for all eternity!A job, mind you, that I take very seriously unlike some people!""Oi!"I shouted at the bickering deities."Tweedle-Dick and Tweedle-Balls!Buddha's trying to fucking say something!"Jesus and Satan stopped their arguing to look to my with raised eyebrows.My gaze went to Buddha, still peering out into the distance."I'm sorry, Buddha, you were saying?""Company."In that moment, the brothers and I looked back to see what Buddha had been seeing for God knows how long.Several Jeeps, completely identical to ours, following behind us and slowly advancing.There had to be at least 10 of them."Jesus Christ..." said by the man himself, oddly enough.Looking back on it, hearing that said literally by Jesus would normally have been either head turing or a good laugh.All it was at that time, however, was my exact thoughts."Jesus!Eyes on the road, and punch it.Satan, protect Amaterasu.Buddha.Give 'em hell."Each of them took to their orders with clear focus.Satan, with the least action to take, looked down at the goddess of the rising sun and sighed."I really hope rescuing you was worth it."(Was all I could write during my break.Will add more later)

Edit: Welp, there you have it.Any feedback would be awesome.
