Matt's old knees creaked with every step but he was determined to make this walk on his own.He passed white tombstones, laid across the immaculate green grass of the cemetery.His knee creaked and he himself stumbled, a hand caught his shoulder steadying him."I'm fine."Matt said."You want me to let you fall" Ben Affleck replied.He was in his nineties as well, but hadn't aged half as badly as Matt."I'm fine on my own.I wish you did'nt think you had be there every day helping me, I could do this alone.""Are you saying the best part of your day is when you look-"
