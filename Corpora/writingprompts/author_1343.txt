The first sensation that registers is the softness of the mattress beneath me.I'm seated at the end of a bed, with my bare feet against a floor strewn with wrinkled clothes.A moment ago I was in my own one-bedroom apartment and, feeling the pinching urge of a post-coffee poop coming on, I had entered my bathroom.Pulling down my jeans and planting my bare ass on the the porcelain throne, I felt the familiar whoosh of teleportation.And now I am here, bare ass planted on cotton sheets.The second sensory realization: the soft rocking of the mattress up and down.I know better than to turn around, but I do anyway.The third sense, barreling through my eyeballs and into my brain with little to no consent, another bare white man-ass--this one midair and swaying behind me, a mere arm's length away.I had expected something of the sort, but the sheer closeness of this bare white ass made me lurch a bit from my newfound seat."What the fuck?!"Came a voice from the ass.Rather, from the owner of said ass, facedown.My stirring had alerted the swaying ass and it's owner, who pivots from his facedown position to face upward.As he pivots, he reveals another naked figure: Madeline."Oh no..." comes a voice of realization and regret from the new naked body.'Oh no', indeed, Madeline.'You did it again', Madeline.I was now standing upright in a shadowed room that was dank with sweat and body smells.Looking down on the scene, I search for words as I have before.The owner of the white man-ass was still wavering in his confusion."Wh-what the.. who the fuck are you?"I look to Madeline.She should explain it.She was the one who had her eyes closed.She was the one thinking about me.I was just trying to take a shit."It's... its complicated Jim," she says.The man-ass has a name.But I will forever know him as the man-ass.Jimmy Man-Ass was dumbstruck."You know this fucking guy?"he blurts."Yes.But it's complicated.He shouldn't be here.""No shit, he shouldn't be here," he said."but why is he here?"Looking to Madeline, then back to me.It was at that moment I realized my pants were still down to my knees, prepped to poop.I scrambled to pull my pants back up."Dan, just leave" she said.Her face now buried in her hand.I would gladly leave, but that's not how this works.She knows that that's not how this works.Ten years ago at the ripe age of fifteen I had made a commitment, unknowingly notarized by an eavesdropping genie (known by his lawyer name Aphrodite), that I would be there for Madeline.Always and forever, whenever she needed me.And, as penciled in by said genie, I was thereby to perform my prescribed duties to effectively complete the task to which I had been summoned.A jaded genie from a genie school that landed him in too much debt for too little money.I paused for too long with an expression too familiar.She knew as much as I did."Dude, leave!"shouts Jimmy Man-Ass.But I can't.Madeline looks at me knowing I can't.This is not the first time I have seen this look--not even in this context.There was a time, five or so years ago, that this situation landed us in the same position but with very different solutions.Now, however, I just wanted to enjoy my Saturday, take a shit, and hopefully catch the game and drink beer until I went to the bar to drink beer.I realize I haven't said anything.I remember the next clause in the genie's jaded contract."Madeline, I need you.I need to use your toilet."The familiar whoosh, a darker room.By the  chill and the dampness, I can tell it's the bathroom.I flick the lights on, I plant myself down.Luckily, Madeline had reciprocated my vow all those years ago.Luckily, as upheld by the genie courts, her usage of the term "then I will always be there for you when you need me" is genie-ly binding only when I have first been summoned as determined by her own need.A bureaucratic nightmare."... what the fuck was that?What just happened?"I hear Jimmy Man-Ass from the other room faintly through the wall.Youth.Growing up.Getting old.Taking shits.Bureaucratic nonsense.
