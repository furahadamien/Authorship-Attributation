It's about time.You'd done your best to ignore the red line so far.Ever since you saw the lines, so long ago.Sure, it was arbitrary at firstafter all, green=good, red=bad, but it was cemented when you found a scratch card on the side of the curb, resting gently beside the green line.You got all excited, and scratched it up in a hurry.$100, easy as that.Sure, it's not much, but it was enough to set you on this path for the rest of your life.The green line carried you pretty well, too, you reckon.The thick paint, almost like the lines on the road, denoted your own personal destiny.Not greatness; goodness knows you were never the top dog, but fate was kind to you.Not that you were really fated to following the green lineit's just the way you are.If there's a line, you follow it.You're no rebel.Don't fix what ain't broke.Damn, but you're a cynic.At 22, you've barely flown out of the nest.But it's not always easy to live your life by literally toeing the line.When it did a 180 degree turn on the sidewalk one day, you turned around without questionjust in time to move out of the way of a pickup truck which had just spun out on the pavement.It crushed six pedestrians, and would have been the end for you, if that line hadn't saved you.They hadn't been able to see the lines.No one could, except you.It got you a good job, too.It's how you met your girlfriend.It's done everything for you, beginning to end.If you follow a script your whole life, are you yourself, or are you a character someone else has written?The paint faded after a week or so, but it stayed around long enough to remind you that its routehome, work, store, homechanged little between days.The red line hasn't shown up too frequently.After they first diverged, you didn't see the red one for a couple weeks.But then there it was.It dripped down a fire escape, crossed the green line, and disappeared into an alley.You glanced after it, but there was nothing of note.Just a long red streak that ducked behind a corner.You would have examined it further, but the green line beckoned you onward, back home.Over the months and years since then, you've seen it every so often.Off in the distance, squiggling its way though a park.Out of a stranger's house, and down the street.Once, pinched beneath a manhole cover.Now, you barely even give it a second thought.Or you didn't.You saw the red line dart out of a bush and up a fence today.You wouldn't have glanced twice.But a strange emotion sprung out of the corners of your psyche and filled your whole body.You didn't _want_ to follow a green line anymore.You wanted to see where the red went.Years of temptation snapped you like a toothpick, all at once.You broke into a run, and chased the red paint into the alley, over the fence.It was a paint lineit wasn't going anywherebut you ran all the same.As you chased it, you noticed other red lines converging, following the same path as yours.Loops of red paint, you hypothesized, that had been here before.All of them were fusing together into a fat red streak on the ground.The red line came this way often.Very often.Where was it going?The red line was wider than a street now.Wider than two lanes of traffic.It covered entire trees and the sides of buildings.It barreled through malls and alleys and fields.Until it funneled into a small door beneath a small sign on a small street where you'd never been before.The sign said: "Paddy's Irish Pub, home of the famous red line.Follow us on Twitter, @PaddysRedLinePub.Read about us in this week's issue of The Guardian, under 'Interview with Paddy's Pub: The Story Behind the Viral Marketing Stunt of the Decade."
