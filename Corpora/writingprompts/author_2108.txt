I turn around and I just knew who she was."No, Cathy.You should've left five years ago."Cathy gave me a big grin, her eyes filled with anger, her fingers trembling.She looked at me from head to toe, seeming disappointed."You should've joined me then.We were a team!Why are you still here?"I tried killing myself with a gunshot through the head five years ago.I wanted to escape from the voice inside my head.She told me that if I ended it, all will be over, she will leave me alone.I miraculously survived.I never heard from Cathy again, until now."Cathy, leave me alone.Please.It wasn't my fault you died inside mother's womb.Please just let me go.""But it was.We were together from the beginning of time.It is not right for us to be apart."She came closer to me and hugged me tight.She was warm.She pulled me in closer and whispered to my ear,

"Come with me.We are all waiting for you."It hurt.It went right through my chest.The last thing I saw were my walls being painted red.
