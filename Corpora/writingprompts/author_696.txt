"Please forgive me!"I said with my voice breaking."Dont do this!Why are you doing this!?"The betrayal in her voice was sharp,like a razor cutting across my ear drum.a traumatic beat cutting deeper into my head until i couldnt bare it anymore.I knew what was at stake,but i still struggled to do this."I am so sorry ,honey" she squeezed my arm as if begging me to save her.i felt the tears in my eyes accompanied by burning agony screaming at the act i would commit.I wanted her to understand but there was no point in explaining."Please forgive me" i repeated again as i plunged the dagger into her heart.She left out one last scream.her breathing became thin.thinner then the air around us.Her grip became weaker then the grip on my sanity.Was what i was told right?I wasnt told how but i was indeed guaranteed that the world would end in a few years.The being who told me definitely was not human...and it gave me this dagger...as soon as i grabbed hold of it...No,there was no way what i was told is a lie.I had hoped it wasnt just me having lost my mind,seeing shit that wasnt there.but i disregarded everything,i was on a mission to save humanity.I didnt know where to start.I had just done what i had thought would be impossible for me.I left my home which i had turned into a horror house,it wouldnt be long before the cops would show up.theres no way nobody heard the commotion.I splash water on my face hoping to get myself together.And brace myself for what is comming next.I kick open my front door and plunge the dagger into everybody i see.i must save as many as i can i thought to myself.Like a wolf hungry for blood.men,women and even disgustingly children are lost to this dagger.This isnt real i thought.This *cant* be real.It seemed like a nightmare and i had completely lost my mind.I pushed those thoughts aside and kept slaughtering people in hopes that it would bring their salvation.It was inevitable that the police would show up,i knew explaining to them wouldnt help.As soon as i heard the sirens in the distance i knew i had to come up with a plan,i hadnt saved enough people and i knew i wouldnt survive this hour.I ran into one of the nearby houses and began frantically searching for something,but i didnt know what.Anything to help me in my dire desperation.The sirens grew nearer and nearer until they were right outside."We know youre in there!Come out with your hands up or we *will* open fire!"This is it.i didnt save as many people as i had hoped and it was drawing closer to the end.i had failed and began to give up hope."Come out with your hands up or we *will* shoot you!"I heard the officer repeat.I wasnt going to give myself up.there was no way.i looked at the dagger in my hand and decidingly knew what my next move was.I grabbed the dagger and aimed it towards my chest.I plunged with all my might and hoped to hit my heart.The pain was unexplainable but i had hoped i did right.I felt my life fading,the dagger disintegrated in my hand,steel turned to sand.It was the last thing i felt before it all went to black surrounded by the piercing sound of sirens.then suddenly nothing but silence and peace.The silence was eventually broken by thousands of voices and thoughts that were not my own,there was nothing except blackness to accompany them.At that point i wasnt myself but these voices and thoughts.i began seeing light slowly caress away the darkness as if they were lovers sharing a farewell.And then i came to.I came to in my living room.it looked as if nothing had happened and everything was back to normal.was that just a nightmare?Nobody else is in my home but me.i begin searching the house and find no one.So i head outside and see the greatest thing i will ever see.It had worked.Everyone i had sunk the dagger into was outside trying to figure out what was going on.They spotted me and smiled in my direction.there wasnt as many people as i had hoped but it was enough to save humanity, at the very least we could start anew.they now knew why i had done what i did,they pieced enough of it together and knew why their friendly neighbor had suddenly become a madman.And out of the crowd she came rushing out.rushing to embrace her hero.My heart raced with joy as she jumped in my arms and hugged me with everything she had.She leaned her head in close.A sweet whispering voice that ensured me everything will be okay.One short sentence to bring back hope
"I forgive you,dad."
