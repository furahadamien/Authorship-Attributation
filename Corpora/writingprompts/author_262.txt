Down_Devious
We do not know the exact year, since time has long been an abandoned concept.But we presume it to be around the 22nd century.There is 500 of us left now.500 humans, out of a world population that used to be over 7 billion.We were outnumbered and outgunned.It was total genocide of the human race itself.What could've provided such unadulterated manslaughter, you ask?Aliens.First came the scouts, in their UFO's in the early 1990's.Satellite's and early photography gave us this weird disc shape that was flying in the sky, we thought them to be oddly angled airplanes.We were wrong.Then came the army, or the "droves", as we like to call them, around 2050.The world was free of war for the first time in the life of country superpowers.Terrorists and acts caused by such were no longer a thing.The world finally got it's peace.That was when the aliens decided to strike.The time to eradicate the human race was when they were at their most peaceful.Unlike a normal genocide, where prisoners were taken into concentration camps, there were no prisoners.Everyone and everything was destroyed on sight.At first the military all across the world gave a fighting chance.Everyone banded together for a common cause; to avoid human annihilation.But they kept coming.And coming.And coming.Not only were their weapons several ages more advanced than ours, but the mere numbers they had on us gave us no chance in hell.When the world started collapsing, leaders of government banded together to create the 1st allied world leadership.They told us we had to start hiding underground, to avoid eradication.So we did, and we were able to live and survive for a few years before getting hunted again.This time, the end seemed inevitable.Until a bright light came cascading down from the sky and forced itself into all of the remaining humans, turning them into Angels of War.We call them Angels because they had wings made out of pure light, and shot out holy beams from their fingertips.This was the turning point in humanity.This was when we started winning the fight for good.
