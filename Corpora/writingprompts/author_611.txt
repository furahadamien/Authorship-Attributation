Thursday
I woke up today wondering where my cat went, its been days.A lot of weird things have been happening since I got back from the Bahamas, this odd smell keeps coming from the basement, Ill have to clean it out on the weekend 

Friday 
I was at work today and nobody would look me in the eye again in the break room, I keep trying to ask bob, my work mate why is everybody giving me the cold shoulder but he seems to be not feeling so well, hes always sweaty and a little nervous around me, maybe this new supervisor position has made me the enemy around the office, Im no longer just one of the guys, everyones on edge anyways cause Peggy left on her lunch break on Monday and no one has gotten a hold over her since, man this whole week has been weird, I keep getting flash backs of Tuesdays miss hap of waking up in the neighbours pool,  I havent slept walked in years, later that day I had found news paper clipping all over my house, I woke up in my bed this morning but with the same thing, 
I hope this doesnt become a habit again, 

Saturday 
Last night the police came to my door rather late, they said the neighbours complained about some screaming, I explained to them that I live alone, got the warning anyways.This week has just been the strangest, there was no screaming, I was reading, though I did wake up in the kitchen this morning with a knife in my hand and a carved up chicken on the counter, jeez the blood was everywhere, that smell is getting stronger, I cant  imagine what kind of rodent died in the vents 


Sunday, 
Found Peggy in the basement, in pieces.I wouldve been terrified if it werent for the enjoyment I got seeing her rotting flesh, sowing the cat fur on her hairless scalp was a good touch, the book of memoirs I had apparently been making in my sleep, 

News clippings, my favourite is psycho escapes again
It feels weird how right this feels

What a weird week...
