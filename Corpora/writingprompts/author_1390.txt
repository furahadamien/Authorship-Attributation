Five thousand left today on all the Earth.I cut the soul of the five thousand and first not one hour ago.The outcome seems inevitable.One by one, they'll fall.One by one, until no one is left.What will happen to me then?I'll take time to consider this.*****

Four thousand are left.The four thousand and first committed suicide.It was tragic.He'd lost his entire family.But no one stops fate.Not even me.After I fulfil my duties, the only thing that remains for me to do is to reap myself.*****

Two thousand nine hundred and ninety nine are left.A malnourished couple both died when they tried to cross a river.It kind of bothers me how the number is off by one.It's like it's telling me: there's one you're not counting.This is a round number.I don't want to hear it.*****

Two thousand are left.I've lived for such a long time that there are no words to describe it...Lived isn't really the right word.Existed, perhaps.And yet, of all entities, me, the one who has had the most time to make sense of it all...I want things to continue.*****

One thousand left.This job is monotonous...But every day, I get a glimpse at what makes people truly human.I've never realised how much it touches me deep down.If I stay around... How will I cope with the emptiness?*****

Nine hundred left today.I'm running out of time.I don't want this Earth to die.I want to see cities brimming with life.I want to see marvels of architecture, fresh after construction.I want to see the rise of civilisations....I don't understand what's happened to me.*****

Eight hundred left.I took pity on a young girl a few days ago.She should have died, but...I delayed reaping her for just long enough...

Just long enough for someone to find her.This is a first.I've never taken pity before like this.I'm forsaking my duties, but deep down I'm wondering if that's so bad.*****

Seven hundred people left.I don't want to let go.I don't want things to end.Understanding what this feels like firsthand is quite something.How could I even feel what death is like myself?The despair?The sorrow?Only in this situation could I feel things like that.It was so impersonal at first.But now, every time I reap someone, it's like I'm dying myself.*****

Six hundred people left.I can't go on like this.*****

Five hundred people left.*****

Five... hundred.I've stopped.I've just stopped.I can't do it anymore.*****

Four hundred and eighty three.It's not enough.The world, it's dying, and I-

Even if I don't reap people, I can't stop them from dying if they just give up.If I don't reap them, their soul suffers and becomes damaged.What do I do?*****

Four hundred and eighty four.A child was born today.It's a rare sight.The child carries my hope for the future with it.Her name is Dawn.*****

Four hundred and fifty nine.I'm trying my best here...

Come on.Show some will to live.Don't you know that dying could be the end of everything right now?Are you so despondent you don't even care?*****

Four hundred and twenty three.I've... begun communicating with people.I didn't know I could, but...

People can sense me.I push them away from danger, and towards supplies and shelter.They don't always listen, but it's a start.*****

Dawn is healthy.She is a very sweet child.If I fail, she might be the last human alive.I don't plan on letting her inherit a dying planet.*****

Four hundred and twenty.Someone...Someone talked to me today.They couldn't see me, but they talked straight at me.Not physically, but mentally.Their heart was open and it showered me in hope and gratitude.They didn't think of me as "Death" today, but as "Fate".*****

I wonder what it means to be Fate, rather than Death.It's not a role I've played before.Death is definitely a type of fate.It's my speciality, I suppose.But in the grand scheme of things, isn't fate more than that?*****

Dawn's mother is sick.I'm so worried about her.I hope she survives.It's pharyngitis.It could get bad.******

I basked in the sun today.It's not a thing I normally do.It's funny how the things that are most important to you only reveal themselves at times like these.Just letting the rays of the sun envelop me...It feels so pleasant.I wish I could do it forever, now that I might not have forever to do it any longer.*****

Dawn's mother, she...

She's going to survive.I refuse to reap her.I won't let her die of pharyngitis.Not at her age.Twenty years ago she'd have survived with ease.I won't let it be different now.*****

Four hundred people left exactly.It's slowed down a lot.A band of travellers have met up with Dawn and her parents.I guided them to her.They have medicine.I'm doing similar things elsewhere.******

I'm caressing the soul of Dawn's mother.It's hanging on to her body by a thread.I'm whispering to her.I'm telling her not to let this be the end.She can't abandon Dawn.She can't abandon the last ray of hope on this world.******

Dawn's mother woke up again today.She's dazed, but she spoke.She told everyone that a guardian angel stood over her, and that it told her not to give up.She said I comforted her, and that she could feel that I was brimming with sadness and hope.She called me Life.*****

Another child has been born.His name is Ercan.Ercan and Dawn live half a continent apart, and they won't even grow up speaking the same language.But even so, I hope that one day they'll meet.*****

The number is going up.I'm pushing it up.I'm exerting every bit of strength that I have.But it's working.I was a fool.I've always been Death because the world needed Death.Why did I keep being Death for such a long time after the world no longer needed me?The world needs Life right now, and I'm it.******

It's Dawn's first birthday today.I don't stand in the sunlight so much any more.Basking in the radiating life force of this human being that's the beginning of it all is so much more fulfilling.I'm not the only one feeling it.Everyone here is.Just like her namesake, she's crawling over the horizon, a shining beacon of a new future.
