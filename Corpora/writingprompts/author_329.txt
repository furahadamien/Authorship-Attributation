I've always had to pretend I was mute.When I was very small, as soon as I hit the milestone to talk, I had been fluent in English.I remember bits and pieces before everything changed.That day I remembered clearly, well the important bits at least.I don't remember that morning, but I remembered the afternoon.Mum and dad had been so proud of me talking, the fact that I was learning and understanding things so quickly, that was until the day their friend had come over.I remember they had a slight accent and when I talked to them, they had been surprised then grinned at me.I happily chatted away while my parents starred on in horror.After their friend left, the smiles on their faces fell instantly.There was a lot of muttered and quite angry talking in the other room.I sat, pretending to play with my toy cars, but my stomach twisted and turned.I had done something wrong, but I didn't' know what.There was a door slam and then the house was quiet.I heard shuffling as dads head poked into the room to check on me before he vanished upstairs.Dinner was silent.Mum was back and hadn't said a word, she was tight lipped and had crashed and banged in the kitchen as she cooked dinner.Dad had talked quietly to me, but kept shushing me if I talked too loud.I didn't get it.Dinner ended without incident, I ever got cake!It's weird how I remember the cake so clearly.The normal routine continued on as the sun set outside.Dad turned the TV on and plonked down into his chair and switched the channel onto BBC 2 to watch Star Trek.I sat on his knee and watched happily as the clinking of glass and cutlery echoed around the room.Then men with weird faces came onto the screen and started talking, brandishing a weapon.I held my hand up like I had one to and yelled at the top of my voice.Suddenly my mum was in the room.She ripped me from my dads lap, screaming at me, hitting me.I screamed and cried, my heart pounding in my chest.I screamed for dad but the hits kept coming.Mum screamed at me to shut up, to never do that again, pinning me to a wall, her face inches from mine.I screamed in fear, begging for dad to help, which sent her into and even bigger rage, another hit struck the side of my face and I crumbled silently to the floor, my head spinning.I heard wrestling and more screaming before the house went quiet.~*~

I was locked in my room after that.That's what I remember next.I hurt, my little white t-shirt with a unicorn on the front was stained with blood from my face.My hand hurt to move.I had wrapped it in a little bandage from my little medical kit.I was hungry.No one had come into the room for ages.When mum did come in I cried and ran to her, but she didn't let me close, she hit me.As soon as my mouth opened she hit me.I shrieked and she hit me again.Screaming at me to shut up.Once I was quiet, just the occasional sniff as I hid in the corner between the wall and my bed I heard something being placed down on the ground.It had been a sandwich and a glass of water.She left, locking the door behind her.The room became my prison.Mum would flip out if she even thought I had made a sound.I eventually stopped talking to everyone, even dad.We moved one day.Just me and mum.Dad didn't come with us.He never lay a finger on me.He would talk to me kindly when mum went out.He would sneak home in his lunch hour to see me.He talked to me, but only allowed me to whisper back, telling me he was the only person I could talk to but only if it was the two of us.I missed him.Mum moved me out after there were questions about whether I was starting school with the neighbours kids.It was just the two of us.I sat quietly, not doing much of anything every single day.She allowed me more freedom, but I was never allowed to utter a sound.She gave me books to read and I quickly devoured them.Once she was satisfied I wouldn't say a word no matter what, she took me to the doctor, who quickly signed something saying I was mute but that was it.I started school the next week.~*~

I sat in class, looking out of the window dreamily.Our supply teacher hadn't arrived yet so there wasn't much of anything to do beyond chat and cause chaos.My class ignored me like they normally did.It was as if I didn't exist at this point.I'd never said a word to anyone in this room.I'd known some of these kids for seven years, if I had said anything, it would spread around the school like wildfire and mum would find out, but I did talk to random people who had no idea who I was.The cashier at McDonalds had been the last one.I really wanted some food and the only person working so early couldn't read the note I had written before I entered, so I had to talk.His eyes had opened widely and he had stepped back from me.He rambled something about a forgotten language, his language before he told me to leave and never come back.I hadn't dared go near that store again.I hadn't uttered a word since.The class went quiet suddenly, unusual for them.A man walked into the room with a presence that screamed he wasn't someone to mess with.I starred at him wide eyed.It was the man from McDonalds.I kept my head down and sunk down in my seat as he looked around the room before pulling out a sheet of paper to do the register.When he got to my name I didn't even bang on the desk like I normally would have, I just stayed quiet.My classmates quickly informed him I couldn't talk and things moved on quickly.Class was finally over, but over the sound of people packing away and sliding chairs I heard a voice boom over the class, "mute kid, stay."
