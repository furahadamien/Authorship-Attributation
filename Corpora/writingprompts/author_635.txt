The-IT
Every  single year, on the same date, my brother comes to pay me a visit at  the retirement home.That date was two days ago, and he didn't come.At  first, I comply assumed that he was a busy man.He worked long hours in  the office and over the course of the last 59 years, he's had many  promotions and many raises.and it seams even his children now are  becoming old enough to take the drug of immortality, like he did.So today I decided to finally leave the home and go look for him myself.Maybe I can surprise him.Maybe I can even see him at work.I spoke to the people at the office, they seamed to think it was a bad idea to let me go.To hell with them, I'm not too frail.I'm strong as I need to be, and to prove it I escape through the window to search for mt brother.I go to his house and there's another family in there.I ask them about the previous owner, but they just assume I'm crazy and slam the door on me.And this used to be such a courteous neighborhood too.I guess many things have changed since I last was out.Next I go to his work and ask around, but they wouldn't let me up into the building.The receptionist tells me no one by that names works there.This is odd.Way too odd.Something is up.Next I go to his favourite cafe.He used to take his wife there all the time, including before they even got married.The barista was a long term personal friend of my brother, so if anything were to happen to him, I'm sure she would know.But she's not at the cafe.I ask the current barista about her, and he tells me it was his mother, and he also tells me where I can find his mother, but that she won't be able to help me.I must take the change, this is starting to drive me insane.I must see my brother again, soon I will die and he will live forever.Could it be that the previous barista was over the age threshold like me?The place he told me to look for her was at my very own retirement home!It's strange because she looked like she was in her teens when she was working at the cafe.Luckily the sun told me the ward too, which was different to mine.I sneak in knowing that when I turn myself in properly I'll get tighter security and won't be able to pull this stunt again.When I get in, I didn't find the barista.Instead I found my brother!he was there in the ward speaking to some of the folks there.I go up to him and shout his name being so happy that I get to see him again!But he looks at me oddly and gets up from his chair, feeling scared now that I'm advancing at him in such a fast manner.He has no idea who I am!I ask him bout his job, his children, the cafe... Nada.I go into the bathroom to cry for a while and then finally turn myself in.The drug of immortality after many years gives you periodical amnesia and problems with your memory both long and short term.Some people even forget speech entirely.The nurse explained to me.Not only that, but my brother has not come to see me in many, many years.I was told many times that I have Alzheimer's.It's been three days now since my brother hasn't come and I leave this note because I've forgotten what he looks like and I know soon enough I will forget I even had a brother.
