The Clown opened his eyes.He was hungry.It was dark.It was damp.It smelled of mildew and old water.And fear.That was there too.The sleeping minds of his prey were prepared for his return.Those with greater shine had felt it first.But now everyone would know it.A little pressure behind their eyes when they were alone.A sensation of something skittering behind them when they were alone in the dark.They were prey, and prey knew when a predator was near.The collective unconscious was hushed, quiet as the jungle when every little bird knew there was a jaguar on the prowl.The Clown smiled his toothy grimace.The jaguar was hungry.The sewers were as he had remembered them.The refuse of the prey told him much about them.There were things he did not recognize, things of metal and plastic and glass.His greater mind apprehended their purpose as he observed them.Interesting.They could serve as a good portal through which to cultivate the fear of his chosen meal.There were new sections of the sewers, and he found them as he skittered hither and yon.He grew familiar with the sights, sounds, and smells of the prey that walked unknowing above.They were ripe for the picking.They did not fear the shadows, but that would make it easier, in a way, now that there was something stalking them that was worthy of their fear.Days and nights went by and still the web of tunnels expanded.The humans had done everything within their power to eradicate every dark corner in which a monster could hide, thinking themselves safe.It was a delicious taste of false security.Some of them had even *lit* sections of his sewers.And in one section, someone dared to *live.* 

At first he had been hesitant.Terrified, even.Their forms reminded him strongly of that *sklpadda.* The Turtle.**Maturin.** He squealed and cowered in a corner as the name rose, unbidden, to his mind and raked across his very being with talons of white-hot light.He waited until the pain subsided and re-emerged to stalk.Yes, they had terrified him with their forms, half-man, half...*that.* But they trafficked with a rat-man, which he had initially mistaken as a servant of the Crimson King...But no, these were something altogether different.They were on neither one side nor the other.They were *neutral.* And therefore... not dangerous.Yes, they were strong.They had weapons, and they knew how to use them.But it hadn't been the slung stones of the children that had defeated him last time, it had been their *shine.* But these were dimwits, and even their rat master's shine was weak compared to those who had been his bane the last time.And so he stalked them.He preyed on them in their dreams, and he waited for the moment that he would strike, to reclaim the last corner of his home so that he would be the only being who inhabited it.He smelled it even now, a dish that had not changed for some time.Pizza.He smirked.They were human enough.They knew fear.He had seen their uneasy glances into the shadows as they passed him.It was no longer their home.It was his.He crept forward, stealing into their lair, slipping through the nether and out into the physical world again.They all slept, snoring.He could feel their sleeping minds.Four dim bulbs, and a fitful flame in a chamber at the end of the long, vaulted room.Brick and stone and plenty of room, a perfect fit to serve as their tomb.He smiled again, savoring the feeling of his teeth sliding out of his impossibly small mouth.The time was now.He strode into the middle of the room and reached toward the minds of the four mutant children.They would die first, and then he would deal with their master.A light flickered on, and suddenly the chamber was bathed in incandescent yellow.The creatures were not asleep.Each sprung from its bed, wielding archaic weapons.The Clown's smile grew.This would be fun."Master Splinter!"one of them yelled."He's here!"There was no fear in his voice.He sounded... jocular.What?How could they have--

The door at the end of the hallway slammed open, the candleflame growing into a torchlight.He was greater than the Clown had anticipated.But still... Not enough.Not enough to stop the Clown.He grinned, his face splitting wider."Gross, dude!"one of the mutants yelled, stepping back.There was the fear.He felt it now, as his form took on a more macabre semblance.The fear was growing, and soon he would feast.The door behind him slammed.What?There were only five.There was no other shine...

"Ah, my friend, it is good to see you," the rat said with an unbearable smirk, looking past the Clown."Here he is, as you suspected he would be."The Clown turned, slowly, to find a simple man, standing in jeans and a soiled white T-shirt that read "I drive the Takuro Spirit."He was lanky with tousled brown hair, and wore a shit-eating grin.He stood with his hand on a gun in a holster.He had no shine.He would not--

The man spoke with a strong New York accent."See the Turtle, ain't he keen."The Clown shrieked as the radiant talons raked at his essence.What was this man?What was--

The man's arm blurred, and he held in his hand a huge revolver, shining steel with sandalwood grips.The Clown's vision was swallowed by that mammoth barrel, pointed directly between his eyes.At the center of that black abyss he saw a glint of copper... and *ka.* 

The man--no, the Gunslinger--pulled back the hammer, and the click resonated through the chamber.No.Not that.Not *that* gun!The Gunslinger smirked."All things serve the fuckin' Beam."
