Winston sat up.The dryness in his mouth had grown to a point that it had finally nagged him awake.The embers of his fire still glowed enough to keep him warm.He felt the soft warm breeze against his face and pushed his hands into the soft earth pulling himself up and out of his sleeping bag.He was so thirsty...

"Abracadabra give me some water!"He chanted.At once a nice fresh glass of water appeared in his hand.He gulped it down greedily and then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand then lay back down satisfied and warm and happy.He looked up out at the stars and wondered."Boy I'd hate to be in some shitty universe without magic."He whispered to himself before falling back to sleep.
