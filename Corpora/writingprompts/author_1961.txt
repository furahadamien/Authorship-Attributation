Schizophrenia.That's what they called it.Schizophrenia.I don't think that really captured what Frank and Moe.I was the only one that could see them, but that didn't make them not real did it?I mean I wish they were, they're not great at advice.My story isn't uncommon among "schizophrenics."My parents noticed something had changed almost immediately, I think they brushed it off as feeling weird about turning 15.But they saw eventually, or I slipped, and to the doctors we went.The medicine always  They were just always talking and no one else could see or hear them.Sometimes they'd be heckling the teacher, or each other, or me.So I got really good at my poker face and they called that I was "flat" which is ridiculous, I just have a good poker face.I looked up from the window.Moe was picking his teeth, a chunk of chicken hit my face."You know kid you got a lot of learning to do about oral hygiene."He said before putting the edge of his thumb back in his mouth.I sighed and stood up from my normal seat by the window, the only place where they wouldn't comment.Boring was always better than interesting with these two around.The rec room was the same bland brown and tan tones used by all the other hospitals too.The lighting was soft and gentle.The clothes I wore were the height of comfort.Too bad they had the "long term treatment" facility's logo on the front.
