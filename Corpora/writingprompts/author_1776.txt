You stared at him dumbfounded as he hung up his jacket in the hallway.He passed you on the way to the sitting room and turned on the TV.You turned to follow him and the news caught your attention, it showed a meteor strike that supposedly happened about an hour ago."Bob tell me, why did it only affect this specific town in California?""I don't know Alice, but it seems that we're receiving more and more phone calls from civilians about their children gone missing.""Is there a link?Are these phone calls received at the same time?""I don't know but I have the feeling that the meteor has something to do with this case.Now on to Amanda for today's weather."Dad switched off the TV and turned to face me."I haven't left for 10 years, I've seen you grow up.Been to the principals office countless times for you being in trouble and buried your mother..." He bit his lip and quickly regained his posture.Dad walked to the coffee table and took his diary from the drawer underneath.He flipped through it and I noticed there was a different date on each page, no date was missing.It was as if he documented every day of his life.He stopped at the last page, which had today's date written on top.He looked me dead in the eye and smiled."Today is the day, today you turn 18."He handed me the diary and ran his hands through his hair.I couldn't say anything, I just looked down at the worn down notebook that had well over 300 pages."Dad?"My lips trembled, I was confused.For 10 long years he was never here, yet he said he buried my mother and watched me grow older."Close your eyes."Dad placed his hands on my shoulders.I wasn't sure what was going on as I was still confused, but I decided to obey.Upon opening my eyes, I saw my dad standing there, he seemed taller and had less wrinkles."Only you can stop this son, only you can stop this."My eyes slid down to my hands, I was still carrying the notebook.Behind me I heard an agonising scream, it was a lady out in the streets."My baby!Where is my baby!"The woman kept on screaming and yelling."It's time."Dad said and walked out the house, into the backyard followed by my mother, whose face I couldn't see no matter how hard I tried."Mommy?"I looked down at the diary again and opened it on the first page.It mentioned today's date, 10 years ago.It stated I had returned from the future after the first meteor and I was the chosen one to save the world from the future meteor strike.The one 10 years in the future.Had I time travelled?Without thinking, I walked out the door, watching my parents along with the whole neighbourhood stare into the sky.A large bright light seemed to head our way, it became brighter and brighter and in a split second, half our town was gone.Evaporated.With the diary in hand, I fell to my knees.In front of the gaping hole that killed half the state.I flipped through the diary again, looking for tomorrow's date.Some letters were disappearing.I had the feeling my time was running out.That I had to warn everyone about the next meteor that would wipe half of this earth.But who would believe an 8 year old?I harshly wiped away my tears and read the next page.It only mentioned a formula and a drawing of a machine.It was named 'The After Years: Time Machine.Model: 0.v4.'I was studying to become a scientist and had always been interested in time paradoxes and time travelling."I won't let you down, dad.I now have an additional 10 years to save the world."&#x200B;
