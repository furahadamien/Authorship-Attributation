Luck - the impossible made possible.Say the right words, show up at the right time, and suddenly everything was possible.Since the dawn of humanity we called this phenomenon many times - fate, divine intervention, a fluke, good fortune.Luck led us to discover the human genome.Luck is what lead to Takashi Yamomoto in the year 2047 to discover the 'luck' gene.It was luck, some would say, that led to the Munshin Incident.To call it a gene may be a bit of a misnomer.It's really what we would call our soul.A unique trait only found in humans as far as we can tell.We're not sure how we aquired it, but it seems to link us to a quantum state, where we can potentially influence the probability distribution.Put simply - some people are just lucky at being lucky.The Munshin Incident changed all of this.When we opened the first gate the results were catastrophic - we thought that we would be opening ourselves to new worlds and possibilities.Those that saw it say that when they ignited the first switch the sky became cascaded in gold, and the stars vanished one by one by one like dancing fire flies.The second switch was never fired, blue beams fell towards the ground as the gate collapsed upon it's self.When we awoke from the chaos we found ourselves in an empty void.Only our sun remained, like a single lantern pointed out towards the vast dark ocean.The incident did a lot of things, changed the way we lived in a lot of ways, but the biggest one was our luck.Petyr Ivanov was the first documented case of Controlled Probability Manipulation Phenomenon.They discovered he had the ability to influence events that occurred outside the realm of possibilities; not always, but more than what would be considered normal.Things like rolling a dice and 85% of the time landing on the number six, firing a loaded gun with one bullet, and it never firing - even when it should.Petyr described the event as such -

"When I concentrate hard enough I can see these windows in my head, in these windows are things that can happen, and those windows have windows that super the next thing, and the next, and the next.I can use my hands, like ghost hands, to pick which one I want.Sometimes the windows are blurry, sometimes the windows don't tell the truth".It wasn't long until we discovered more cases, people describing similar things, with varying results.What we discovered is that luck gene for some became stronger than others.We now grade it on a scale.At 15 you would be at what we call base luck.You cannot directly influence or control the events around you, and you aren't aware of the possibility of the events that may occur.Anything lower, and your, well, unlucky.At 25 you are what we would have called lucky previously.Things just kind of go your way most of the time.Your not aware of the possibility of the events, but your subconscious mind is capable of influencing the desired outcome.35-59 you are exceptionally lucky.You just know where to go, what to do, what to say.You cannot change the variables directly, and are not aware of all possible outcomes, but you have an insatiable drive that leads you to your accomplishments.Petyr would have been between the 60-75 range.These rare individuals can see the events, and most outcomes, and use it to directly influence the probability of an event occurring.At this stage the ability can flucuate.People usually don't live for very long within range.Seeing the possibilities, being that aware isn't something that humans should know.100, that's the highest it's ever gone according to some.There's no one recorded to be at 100, and no one knows what it's like - except for me, or so I thought.At 100 you just don't see the probability of something, you don't just influence it, you create it.The improbable becomes the probable for you, no matter what.Reach into your wallet that you know is empty, and you can pull out a 100$ bill, open a door and be in a completely different country, blink and wipe an entire city from existence.You are immediately aware of this, there's no learning, it just becomes who you are.I thought I was alone with this, but there's six others.I'm not sure exactly how they found us, something about being able to detect irregular anomalies.It doesn't really matter though, they know we could escape, that we could make the entire complex vanish, make them forget we even existed.They brought us here for a reason though - to go back home.
