It was small at first, the occasional fever, melanin generation in random spots, tiny malignant tumors, but as that so called "godly" generation kept staying the same, their body's desperately attempted to change.All a lost could do was watch from the sidelines as over time things got worse.I remember the day it started to go downhill, it wasn't small this time, it was like someone had struck a gong and people finally woke up.One of the participants in the pills clinical trial was found dead in his apartment.I remember the photo they released, the corpse looked like a husk, free from all muscle or fat.What worried people was that the corpse had partially grown limbs coming out of him like mushrooms on a decaying log, as well as elongated primary limbs.All the food in his fridge was completely gone, and when people came to realize what was actually happening all hell broke loose.The mans body generated new cells at an unheard of rate, causing him to need to consume calories constantly in order to keep up with the unnecessary cell generation.The cause of death was starvation.Things were bad and people began to fall based on when they took the drug, it turned out that it had a 57 year delay.The government tried to manage it by resorting to methods which we thought went away after world war 2.After one of the trialists took to the street and attempted to consume people to stay alive, that's the day when the fall truly happened.Despite the chaos a group of researchers studying the growth phenomenon released their findings on what exactly those bodies were trying to grow into.Those scientists reported they fed the most nutritious and calorie abundant food to a trialist for over a week following the incident.It stopped growing after a point, resulting in a mass of flesh and bone that looked like an eldritch horror.If the point of immortality is to propagate a species, I suppose this pill did quite the opposite.That mass of flesh came to be called a hive, and when cut open it showed that something was growing inside, something not human.As the government collapsed and chaos reigned, rioters raided the headquarters of H.G Pharma, and lynched the president.The interesting part wasn't his death, but his confession.He confessed to making a deal with "The Devil".He claims it came from under the earth, and that its been here far longer than us.It gave him the recipe for the pill in exchange for "a favor" I think I know what that favor was.With the immortals turning and the lost watching, what was left of the government started one final program.I may not be immune to age, but biology isn't everything, a research facility outfitted a select group of remaining lost with top of the line cybernetic enhancements.Our bodies, enhanced.Our limbs, replaced.Our minds, sharp.We are no longer the lost, but Americas last hope.My name is Rory, and I am the commander of the found.
