"It was you all along!"I know the voice and I know the anger, so I don't bother to turn around.I'm sitting in an easy chair in the late 2030's, rubbing the beard on my jawline while watching the stock market for when I return to the 2010's.Fun fact about time travel and paradox: Neither one cares who scores more points among the 1% so long as you don't do something to change a vote or a catastrophic event.Egads, Trump.I pour myself another shot of Tequila and down it before I turn to my accuser, a youthful-looking young woman with skin somewhere between the shade of cinnamon and milk chocolate, her long black hair framing a petite face with large brown eyes... which were currently set in outrageous anger."Aruna it was me...What?"I ask, scratching at my itchy face.Normally I preferred to be clean-shaven, if just because it helped me to better blend in with society at large, but for my latest masterpiece, I'd been forced to grow a very specific style of beard and mustache.She'd described it to me, after all."I can't believe you'd do this!Did this!Whichever!"She declares, stomping one petite foot, eyes so wide with anger I can see the whites at the bottom and top.I'm fighting down a giggle as she does so."The last time I saw you was late 2020's, wasn't it?"I ask, feigning ignorance."Halloween, if I recall.When we met up, you'd already had a couple drinks.We went to your friend's place and you told me about that other immortal you'd been chasing for centuries and never finding.The only one you'd ever encountered."She throws the photos at me.They're progression pictures of me growing the beard after the Halloween party and then putting on the suit she'd described as so distinctive.It matched her description perfectly, probably because I was trying to find a suit which matched her description.I briefly wondered if that was predestination or not.Probably was."Well you've found your immortal, after five hundred very long years.Aren't you satisfied your journey is at an end?"I ask, noting the delightful way her face is going red with anger."What do you think, three decades to cool off?"I'm in the 2060's before she completes her lunge across my desk.
