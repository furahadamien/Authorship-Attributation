After work I head to the library, looking for the front page when my wife and I got married.They are annoyingly muddled but I persevere.As I flick through I notice names coming up over and over, wonderful heroes and awful villains, their heroics thrill me and their crimes amaze me and I wonder why I never really paid attention before.Two hours in I realize i have been looking for more stories about the worst villain instead of my wedding, I can't help myself.I'm too curious to know what possesses a man to do these things, what makes him laugh his way through them with a wide smile.I rarely laugh or smile, I'm known for my serious demeanor.A photo catches my eye, half blurry, taken by a terrified bystander in front of a terrific explosion, a man and a headline, a familiar face stares at me, caught in a rictus grin and the headline screams at me "JOKER STRIKES 
AGAIN!"I feel myself smiling, i hear laughter, it is my own.I have work to do, everything has been so ...boring lately.
