WHAM!It happened again.First there is this flash of light, then a blur of color and everything goes dark.A moment later I open my eyes and there she is once again."Hi Sammy", she says in her usual crestfallen voice."Hi Nicole.What's going on now?Pumpkins the kitten run away again?I told you she's just not an outside cat.""No.I locked myself out of my house.""Again?!?Did you get the hide-a-key I told you to get?""Yeah.""Where did you put it?""Under the flower pot.""Well that's original."I check her hiding place."Nicole, its not there..."

"I know.""Where is it?""Its in my purse.That's where I put it after the last time I got locked out.""Where's your purse?""It's in the house."Nicole slumps her shoulders and averts her eyes into the distance.I lean in and in a lowered but tense voice ask, "Have you called the locksmith yet?""My phone is in the house too."I lose my patience."Jesus fucking Christ Nicole.""Hey I can't help it if stupid Aphrodite makes you come every time I need help with something.""Nicole you need help with shit *all the damn time*.At least twice a week I get zapped here and I can't leave until your crisis is over.Have you any idea of what affect this has on my life?""Sorry," Nicole replies meekly.Sorry?You're sorry?Nikki you know how hard it is to hold down a decent job with this shit?I've had to plan my life around the possibility of you losing your keys or your cat getting outside or you oversleeping in the morning - which happens all.the.damn.time.""I try, really I do.I feel terrible.""YOU TRY?YOU FEEL TERRIBLE?"I'm now near yelling, but stop and take a breath."You have any idea what it is like for me... On this end... To live this kind of life?To serve you and fix your everyday fuck ups?For fucks sake I hope you *feel bad*.If it were me and our roles were reversed I would do everything in my power to make sure you didn't have to appear.I would make damn sure I wasn't dragging you in on every time I stubbed a toe or ran out of toilet paper."Nicole remains standing there looking sad.She's got her hands in her pockets and she's using her shoe to kick a pebble three inches one way and then three inches in another."Nikki...  Do you know when was the last time I had a girlfriend?You think that's possible with our given...*arrangement*?""Well you were the one who who proclaimed to the Goddess that you would love me forever"

"I WAS FIFTEEN!""I suppose it makes it a bit difficult", she acknowledges."A bit difficult?A bit difficult?"I'm exasperated."Why bother even dating?Can you imagine how the conversation goes?*Um yeah well you see there's this girl I dated for 3 months when I was fifteen and every time she misplaces her car keys I disappear until they get found*.Yeah that goes over GREAT.""So you're mad because you're *frustrated*?""Oh don't even", I tell her."That *is* something I can help you with", she grins at me."OH MY GOD!"I clench both fists and shake them upwards."HOW ABOUT JUST HAVING YOUR SHIT TOGETHER?"I'm really pissed off now.She continues, "Seriously though, if we were husband and wife this whole thing would actually be super convenient."I deadpan back at her, "You're unbelievable."Smiling she says, "I know.Are you going to call the locksmith or what?This time you need to stay for a little while.I *do feel bad*.I want to make it up it you.""Well OK", I say hesitantly."But I don't know how you could make this disaster tolerable - and you better have your credit card available for the locksmith.""I lost my credit card.""..."

Yeah so that's how my wife and I started dating.I went in the house afterwards, she fed me a few beers and I ended up spending the night.Really, it was only livable result possible.We stopped being angry about it and once we accepted our collective fate stopped resisting the inevitable.Funny thing though, we've been married 10 years and it's been about a year since I poofed anywhere to have to help her out.Interesting how that works.
