I woke to the sound of rustling plastic.I left the window open again I thought to myself as I slowly sat up and began wiping the thin layer of dust from my skin.The dust rolls in every morning now, just like they said it would.I checked my watch.It still read 7:55 just like it did when it stopped three years ago.Old habits.I got up from the ground and continued to brush the dust from my lower half and moved towards the open window.The tattered curtains of the old hotel seemed to be enjoying their dance.I slid the window closed and pressed my palm against the warm pane.I made a small circle in the dust on the glass and looked out.It was just like someone put the planet in an hourglass, flipped it upside down and then broke the glass.Times up.I sighed and turned my back on the window.Not sure this view was any better though.The green, flowered wallpaper was torn in so many different directions, and the room was completely empty, stripped of anything useful.As most places are now.I checked my watch again.My eyes wandered to the empty Oreo package that woke me from my not so restful slumber.I swallowed hard.When would he be back?When I was a girl, I was absolutely obsessed with sweepstakes of any kind.I applied for everything!All of them!If there was a prize to be had, I was going to get it.Except I never did.Until one day, when I was about 12 years old and had nearly given up on contests all together.I was just getting home from school when I saw a man and a boy around my age standing on my front porch talking to my mother.When she saw me she smiled and motioned for me to come over.The man billowed out a congratulatory speech as I climbed my front steps and the boy thrust a shiny blue package of Oreos into my hands.I looked down at the cookies and then up at the three smiling faces staring back at me and tried my best to comprehend what was happening.I had won a contest.I actually did it!I had won a lifetime supply of Oreos.If only someone had told me that I really won a lifetime of heart ache instead.Every month from that day on, the boy delivered me a package of Oreos.At first it was exciting, absolutely thrilling!But as I grew older, I became more interested in the boy behind the cookies.One day when I was about 16 years old, I got the boy to sit with me on the porch steps and share the package of cookies with me.We laughed and held some long gazes.But it ended with a "see you next month".It always ended with "see you next month".But each month I got him to stay a little longer.The boy followed me through a move and through college.I asked him multiple times how on Earth he was continuously delivering the cookies no matter where I went or what I was doing.He always just told me it was his job to know.As I grew into a woman and the boy into a man, I started wanting more from him than just cookies.I started wanting him and I sure as hell wanted him more than once a month.But even so, it always ended with, "I'll see you next month".The first day the dust rolled in, was the day things got more complicated.I was beginning to realize that I, along with the rest of the world was running out of time.Who was to say how much longer any of us would have here?How much longer we'd have left to live, let alone love.On my next delivery I bore my soul to my cookie man.I told him I couldn't let this world end without him by my side.That if we had any time left at all, I wanted it to be with him.He set the Oreos on the coffee table in front of us and kissed me hard."I'll see you next month".My eyes were burning from a combination of dust and tears.Remembering everything we've gone through and still as confused as ever.I looked at the section of wall that I ripped the wallpaper from in order to mark the days.I recounted the tick marks.He was supposed to be here yesterday.He's never been late.In all these years, he has never missed a delivery day.I picked up the ripped open Oreo package and held it to my chest.If only he had stayed.I won so much more than cookies that day.
