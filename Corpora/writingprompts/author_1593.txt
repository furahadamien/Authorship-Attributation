Wait a minute, what, where was I?I was in a place called a gym, and I was looking at a very attractive female in very tight and smooth...fur, was it?That was how I woke up.I remembered everything from the dream I had after I ate the mushroom growing out of the dung left by an elephant.Our more powerful gorilla cousins usually grabbed them first, but I was lucky.I found one, and I saw and learned from what I saw.The females went to find food, and I stayed behind, looking for a good stick.Some of us used sticks for digging after roots and the grubs and other crawling animals we used as food.I held two of my fingers apart, looking for a stick that branched in just that way.It took me most of the day, and when the females returned with the food, I noticed how coarse real females were compared to the females in my dream, and after the Strongest took what he wanted, the rest of the males began to eat.I ate last, being focused on my search for the right branch.When I found it, I looked to see if anyone was watching.Everyone else was either eating, mating, or making waste.Strongest was mating, so I hid my stick under my arm, and I moved to my tree, climbed into my favorite branches and examined my stick.It was a grayish-brown, and it had a few knobby parts, but it seemed strong.I tried to rub it smooth, but the best I could do was pull off some of the bark.One of the females came to my tree and offered me more food, hoping to shelter in my tree.I allowed her to climb up, and we shared our warmth with each other.We didnt mate, but we did learn each others scent.She was pleasantly warm and smelled of a particularly delicious fruit.The next day, we woke and she went to gather food.A gentle touch suggested she would return to bring me some particularly tasty food, and I abandoned my tree to find a rock.The best place to find good rocks was where the water flowed.Unfortunately, large predators, elephants, and our larger cousins tended to go there for water as well.Standing water was better, as falling in was less risky.So I went to where flowing water met standing water, holding my stick, and making sure nobody else from my group was nearby.Maybe I would be eaten or lost, but that was a risk everyone took.I tried to be as quiet as I could, but I was louder than I wanted to be.Still, I was far enough away that I didnt alert danger.After many tries, I found a rock to suit me, but it didnt stay between the branches.It was getting close to the time the females would bring food, so I moved quickly, ignoring stealth, and returned to our trees.Again the female with the pleasant scent brought me food, and we shared warmth.Another female came behind her, and she also had food.I allowed her to join us, and the three of us ate our food, mated, and slept among the branches of my tree.One, or even two, females in my tree were of little consequence to Strongest.He had five, and if he wanted one from another male, he would intimidate the other male into submission or attack the other male.My females werent particularly large, so I doubted that he would bother with mine.Other males might, but I was large enough to make them reconsider the idea.The two females who shared my tree went to gather food, and I stayed in the tree, trying to understand why my rock and stick wouldnt stay together.Then I saw the spider tree.An unwary bird flew into the spider tree and was held fast to the branches.I understood then that I could use the spiders traps to make my rock and stick stay together.This was dangerous because the spiders could make us sick with a bite, and some of us would die from the bites.So I found a long stick to pull some trapping strings away from the trees.I got a large wad of the strings, and ran away with it, making sure the spiders didnt follow me.I put the wad on the rock, and the rock fell out.I put the wad between the rock and the stick, and the rock fell out.I became frustrated, and stopped.Then I saw a snake capture a prey animal.It wrapped around the prey, holding it in place.Then, it devoured the prey.I put the rock between my hands and rolled the wad of trapstring between them, making them into a snake.Then I wrapped the string around the stick and the rock, and that kept them together!When the females returned, I decided I was going to get more food tomorrow than the females could bring.After the females left the next day, I went in another direction and waited in a tree.A large rodent came up to the tree, and I dropped down, swinging my new hammer into the rodents head as hard as I could.Then, I returned to my tree, so the females who were coming to the tree could have some food as well.Strongest approached my tree shortly after the two females came back to my tree.He attempted to take the food I gave the females, but I swatted his hand aside, keeping my hand on my hammer.He grunted and shrieked at me, and I pushed him with my free hand.He then howled and beat his chest, and I grunted at him.Finally he seized the meat one of my mates was holding, and I swung my hammer at his head.Now I am Strongest.You may think I dont remember all the things.The computers, cell phones, and cars.I do.I remember the books, music, and art too.I remember spices and where they can be found, but my species barely has language, and you have to start somewhere.
