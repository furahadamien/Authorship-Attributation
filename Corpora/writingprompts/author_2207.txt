(Sorry for the crappy writing, I haven't written anything for years.)I stood there, trying to process what exactly just happened.Michael just went through the pillar... My child, Michael went through the pillar.I walk carefully toward it, it's brown and red plethora of bricks, looking seemingly solid.I turn to look around the station, checking if anyone saw or is watching me.Everyone is more interested in their phones and their trains, they aren't pay attention.I put my hand to touch the pillar, expecting to just touch solid, but instead felt a cool feeling of some kind of liquid between my fingers.I close my eyes and decide to plunge myself through and I found myself on platform 9 and 3/4.THE platform.The platform that I have read for the past 20 years with Harry Potter's adventures.All around me I see parents saying good bye to their children on the train and the train blowing steam "MOM!Bye mom!"The train is moving away, with my son on it.I start to wave good bye, but then a wave of fear comes over me when I realize, He's not suppose to be on that train!"MICHAEL!GET OFF!MICHAEL!"But it was too late, he was gone.The train was chugging out of the station into the bright September day.The first thought in my mind was my child just left on a train to a magical school, with no real invitation.This is bad.We are muggles, they will erase our memories!What should I do?I must of been freaking out physically because before I knew it, a hand gently grabbed my shoulder.I looked up and a red haired woman, was looking at me worriedly."Are you okay?"I look over next to her and I see a older gentleman with round glasses and messy black hair, watching over us.I stand up as I realize, this is Ginny and Harry Potter.The characters... of my books, are real.For some strange reason I felt like I could trust them, but then again I have read about them for years."No!I'm not okay!My child is on that train, and he's not suppose to!"I explain my situation and hoping they can help me."Oh that J.K Rowling, she knew what kind of trouble she would get into for writing about our world.But rest assure, your child is accepted."Ginny said with a knowingly smile.I was confused."Didn't you understand me?I wrote that acceptance letter!It's not real!"Harry smiled, standing next to his wife, "If you both got through the pillar, it means you are accepted.Only student wizards and their families are only allowed through here.So if you child is of age for school, then he was really accepted there."My heart felt lighter, Michael is accepted?He's a wizard!I was so happy, but there was still one question, "Then why haven't we gotten the letter yet?"Ginny shrugged and pointed out."Well you are Americans are you not?Your accent?It's possible the letter didn't get to you because of this.It is half across the ocean" The idea was plausible but still worrying.Ginny grabbed my arm and smiled as she waved over two other adults, which I saw were Hermionie and Ron."Now then, instead of worrying, why don't we go to celebrate a new Hogwarts student as well as a new wizard family?We should stop by Diagon ally and buy his school supplies.He must need them as soon as possible.We all walk toward the pillar, leaving the station behind.Besides, a nice cup of tea will help you calm down.
