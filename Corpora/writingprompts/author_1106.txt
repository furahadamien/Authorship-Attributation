DAY 30, Mars Base Dragon: 

Today, we found something that you wouldn't believe!A Soviet flag!On Mars!The thing was made of metal and stuck out of the ground like one of those old vertical banners.It didn't move in the wind, mainly because the wind here is hardly anything, but it did have a distinct etching on the front.The old hammer and sickle.That's wild.The wall fell when I was six, and then we had a man on the moon same year.When did they get time to send a ship all the way out here?I don't know but we hear back tomorrow what we are to do about it, or if we should just leave it.DAY 31, Mars Base Dragon:

They wanted us to go retrieve it today, and do some scans of the area.And, I know it was wild yesterday but this is where it gets wilder, we found a whole base!An abandoned base.I mean, we know of it's existence but we haven't gotten a chance to go in yet.They said it would be violating sovereign russian soil, but I mean we are on Mars for goodness sake.The scans showed that it has at least 8 different rooms, and turns out that the flag we found was actually on top of it.DAY 40, Mars Base Dragon:

Today we received an evacuation order.It came in very early in the morning, while we were all sleeping.It told us all to gather back up into the pod in which we came, and to jettison ourselves into permanent orbit until we can be received by another crew scheduled to launch 2 weeks from now.I don't know why they sent us this order so suddenly, but today has been nothing but us packing our stuff up into their crates, the rations and the suits and the computers.We spent almost 3 months getting out here, and several years of training.I feel myself grow afraid at what could have them taking us home so quickly.We set out tomorrow morning.DAY 52, Red Dragon Pod:

its just me and john now.we made it to orbit but the others    the looks on their faces will always haunt me.we have the rations to remain up here in orbit,  john and i,  for several weeks   now that there is only 2 of us maybe even 5 months   
i just wonder if i have the will power to stay up here that long with what i saw still in mind.DAY 83, Red Dragon Pod:

now i have rations for 6 months.
