I miss the days when life was simple.As a kid I had not a care in the world.I would stay out late until the street lights came on and then when I heard my mother calling me I would go inside and have dinner with my family.Those were simpler times.When I look at the world left behind after the apocalypse wiped out everything I loved I can't help but wonder if things could have been different.I mean why me?You see I am the last guy on earth, or at least I thought I was.When I was kid I thought everything revolved around me and when I was left to my own devices several years ago I found out how isolating that really is.All the things I thought were important seem minor when I have nothing left but some stupid oreos and the ruins of a life I once shared with people I loved.I thought it was a dream come true when I was just a kid and I found out that I won a lifetime supply of Oreos.I think I was 10 then.I had bragged to my friends about how I would eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner.I was excited when the first delivery came, and then the next ones after.It was the highlight of my existence.I had been so consumed with those damn cookies that I hadn't even noticed that people were disappearing.It was subtle at first, the mailman didn't come around anymore, then the garbage man.When I had finally started paying attention to something other than how long it took for America's favorite cookie to disolve in milk I was the only one left.It turns out, the apocoalyspe hadn't been fire and brimstone like we all thought it would be.It was more like invasion of the body snatchers only there were no replacements left behind to mimic the people who were kidnapped.Instead there was no one.Just me and these damn Oreos.I started getting scared.I was a little kid and I was all alone, so I started going around, I knocked on doors and if the place was nice enough I lived there for a while and wouldn't you know it, each month, I got those oreos.At first I was happy that something in my life was consistent considering the turmoil I was living in.No one to tell me when to shower or brush my teeth.No mom to wash my clothes and cook me food.Just me and these oreos.Every single month.I'm not ashamed to say that as a kid I wasnt the brightest crayon in the box.Hell, to this day I am still not winning any IQ tests but I started to wonder where the hell these Oreos were coming from.I'm not usually one to look a gift horse in the mouth but I never even entered a contest to win the damn things, so how did I get chosen?The older I got and the more deliveries I received I started considering this.I still ate the cookies because they gave me comfort, but I was still suspicious of their origin.What if they weren't really oreos?What if the person sending them to me was lulling me into a false sense of security so he or she could harvest my organs or eat my brains?Okay I started getting paranoid too, sue me.One night I was staying at the governors mansion, turned out he was gone too and as you can imagine I was torn up about it.Anyway I was staying there with all of his top notch gadgetry and his marble floors.I watched the cameras outside the door as I waited for the Oreo delivery.For years I had never actually seen anyone bring them, no one rang the doorbell, they were just there.I thought, if anything, I could catch the guy bringing them to me and ask him where he came from.Maybe he could take me with him to the camp of people who survived the collapse of civilization and I could finally have some new friends.Yeah, I was pretty desperate.So I waited, and waited.Then I waited some more.Finally I heard a noise on the camera and I looked up to see something flying near my door, I ran down the stairs as fast as my legs could carry me, excitement bubbling in my chest.I flung the door open and in front of me with a box of oreos was an Amazon delivery drone.Talk about anticlimactic.Apparently the thing was programed to delivery packages no matter what.So there were no people.Only an amazon warehouse somewhere that still have a lifetime supply of oreos, and some drones that still delivered them to me, every single month.But how did they find me?
