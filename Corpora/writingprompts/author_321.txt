"Don't do drugs."A phrase I've heard since I was a very small child.They never told us exactly why not to do drugs.We were only told "Don't do drugs."And that was that.Fast forward to where I am now an adult and ironically despite being continuously told not to do drugs, I did drugs anyway and what I've been told and what I actually experienced was something the adults never bothered to tell us.I never understood that, until very recently.You can consider me as a drug abuser.Here's the thing though, I shouldn't be even be here to write this story.You hear people dying from overdose and most of those overdose cases usually involves mixing different drugs that cause catastrophic effect on the human brain and body.I've done done drugs and mixed drugs many times, yet I always woke up ok.I thought I was just lucky, until I've experienced something.Dreams are a strange phenomenon and nobody really knows why we dream but most people don't think about that fact and truth be told, you shouldn't try to find out why we dream because you may not like what you uncover.Ever wondered why ghosts are a worldwide phenomenon?How can people see something that doesn't exist?Or I should say shouldn't exist.Which is more real, dreams or ghosts?You see dreams when you go to sleep but, if you really want to, you can see ghost by forgoing sleep and continuing to stay awake.I did this.I stayed awake for consecutive days.Not out of intention of seeing ghost but rather I didn't want the party to stop so I kept using many different forms of stimulants.People say what you see when you stay awake for a long period of time is just a form of hallucination and illusions, but can't you say the same thing about dreams?It's all made up in your head, right?You would think that but here's the fucked up part.When people go to sleep, they experience different dreams but everyone who has stayed awake for too long somehow see the same thing, mostly they see "The Shadow People".It first starts with some whispers in your ears, then you see something out of the corner of your eye, then you see strange black matters fidgeting in front of your eyes.It looks so real, like a tangled up black cords floating in the air and moving very erratically.Take a moment to look around the objects around you.You know it's there and you know it's real because it looks real and there's no doubt about that at all.However, when you see that floating black cords in front of you, you just stare at it because it looks as real as everything in your room.If you have some black cords, dangle that in front of you.That's EXACTLY how those things look.It reflects light just as a real object would.The only difference is you can't touch it, your hands just go right through, but its still there.You continue to stare at it because it just looks **real**.This is just the beginning and if you ever reach this point, do everything you can to go to sleep.If you have sleeping pills, take a handle of that.If you have some hard liquor, drink until you pass out.Just don't stay awake any longer as this is your last warning and chance to turn back before you reach the point of no return.You've been warned.As you continue to stay awake, you start to see people.Not ordinary people you are used to seeing, but these people are completely pitch solid black, kind of like a giant human clay, and you get to see more and more of these people around you.Some are little children, some are adults, some are very tall (like 7'), some are elderly and some, well, let's just say it's not something you've ever seen before.Most of these shadow people will just mind their own business.Some just sit in one of your chairs, some will walk around but there are some that will look right in your direction.They have no eyes, but they are looking at you.They don't have a mouth, no nose, some has ears but their faces are completely empty, yet they keep looking at you.Then others start to look in your direction.Then others stop what they were doing and look at you.They know you can see them and you're not supposed to be able to see them.Some may start walking toward you, very slowly yet very deliberately.You can run away but you realize that these shadow people are actually everywhere and just like before, one by one, they start to turn their heads to look at you.All of them in complete silence.They all look so real and as you see more and more of them, you began to question what exactly is "real".There are things we can't see but we can feel.There are things we can't feel but we can see.There are things we can hear but we can't see.So is what I am seeing right now real?Or was nothing ever real at all?Was the concept of real made up by humans to create some construct and understand life?Then, one of the shadow people suddenly appears right in your face.You can't touch them, but you can see them.They are looking right at you."Is this the chance to find out the purest form of truth?"I asked.Then I began staring back directly at the shadow person.Then I began to feel something come out of my body.I wasn't able see it, but I was able to feel it.It was something like a sentiment that has been growing inside my soul/body/whatever and now it has reached the stage where it was able to leave my body, not completely, but even though I can't explain it, I knew it was something that I have always felt it's presence.Then I began to feel the thing that was growing out of my body began to exert a strong force of power as I continue to directly stare at the shadow person.Then, out of nowhere, I was ready to confront.Not just the single shadow person looking at me, but I was ready to confront not only all the shadow people, but everything else that may have been lurking around.As time went on, the reality I knew and the reality I was in was so different that I began to accept that reality is just a concept.It's one of those paradoxical things: Reality is simultaneously real and fake; it exists yet doesn't exist.I guess you can call it a illusion but that description is so superficial because it is so very far from the truth."There's no turning back now", I thought.Then while directly staring at the shadow person, I slowly raised my hand and did the beckoning sign (the come here gesture).The shadow people around slowly started to surround me.I should have felt scared but I felt ready.I felt it was time to confront.I felt confident because the sentient being that has been growing inside of me was ready and eager to face the inevitable.It was do or die and I was ready for whatever fate awaits.Then all the sudden, I woke up in my bed with the ray of sun hitting a part of my body.I had a really bad headache, a common symptom from doing too much drugs the night before and I did in fact did a lot stimulants and been awake since Thursaday until Sunday (Friday on that week was a holiday so work was off).Everything was back to the reality I was used to, or so I thought.People seemed a bit...different.Nothing too significant but I felt like overall the people I interact with daily treated just a tiny bit different from before.Like they would smile more, they would laugh at my jokes more and overall they seem to be more accepting of me, and this all happened in matter of days.What was that experience?Was I just dreaming?Was is drug induced hallucination?Why don't I remember going back to my place to sleep in my bed?Do you know how sometimes when you're dreaming you are convinced that dream is actually your real life, until you wake up?Am I just repeating a cycle?Or was that whole experience just a reminder that reality is just a paradox?Is everything and everyone in my life real yet don't exist at all?What was the thing that I felt that was growing out of my body to protect me?Did I die and just waking up in another version of my world over and over again?Nobody knows what happens when you die but everyone will eventually know but what if I already died many, many times before, only to wake up to my new reality, which automatically convince me that the world I woke up to is real?I don't know.I guess things are just way out of my capabilities of understanding the truth about reality and life.But do you feel it?Do you get the feeling that sometimes someone or something is watching you?Do you ever feel, when you go inside an empty room, you don't feel alone?You ever feel something is there?Or is reality just a figment of my imagination?Are all of this, the world around me, my friends, my family and myself is just something I made up and no one is real and nothing is real?Are dreams and reality basically just the same thing?Is this just a cycle that just goes on and on and on and on until one day, I finally find out that every time I wake up, I've been living a different reality every single day, 100% convinced that I knew who I was, who my mother was, who my sisters were, the experiences I had, etx did in fact happened.Were those shadow people the past "me"?Getting disposed every time I go to sleep and they were the ones who knew the truth and the sentient being that I thought was protecting me was actually something that prevented me from knowing the truth?Or was that sentient being was actually who I really am, constantly manipulating reality to....I don't know but have you ever heard the question, "What is the meaning of life?"Maybe that sentient being was searching for something.Maybe dreams are just a flashbacks of the shadow people before they got disposed.Maybe it's just me but, I feel like something is watching me and I'm starting to feel sleepy.I wonder what will I dream of next.EDIT: So apparently, I wasn't supposed to tell anyone this.Things are now going to be a bit different and probably a bit more challenging as well.Wish me luck, I'm probably going to need it.
