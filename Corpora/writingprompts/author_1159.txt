"If you can't predict the outcome, don't make the choice."That's Mother's favorite quote.She came up with it herself, and I think she was really proud of that."I could've been a poet," she'd grumble to me as we readied dinner, "I have a way with words that Shakespeare would envy."She'd go around the house, cleaning every surface and repeating that saying at any little opportunity she could squeeze it in.Sometimes, even when it was unnecessary.Once, as she dusted off Daddy's pictures, I caught her muttering it to herself, shaking her head at one like it wronged her.At the time, my six-year-old self couldn't figure out why, but only because it was something that would grow clearer with age.I heard that quote a lot, so I shouldn't have been so shocked to hear it echo in my thoughts after I left that old house behind for college.As if a shadow of Mother had entered my mind, I heard those words every time I faced a decision.Back then, it was just a small nuisance, an annoying relic of the past spent with a disgruntled mother.Only when it was too late did I realize that it was actually a poison that infected my mind at a young age.Now, most of my days had passed me by, and I had never once taken a risk.All that I could've had was out of reach.Throughout my childhood, I listened to my mother's moans of regret.I overheard thunderous quarrels between my parents that often ended in a slap.I witnessed her silently weep when she thought no one was around.All because she pushed away her old life for Daddy's love, a love that was not yet strong enough to endure the strain of marriage.Risk ruined her, so she hammered that saying into my head.Cautioning me over and over to always play it safe, even if I didn't notice.And I obeyed her.I wouldn't get the life I wished for, but at least I would've gotten one better than Mother's.Never had I realized that playing it safe was just as much of a risk--a calculated risk, sure, but a risk, no less.Because life in itself is risky, and attempting to avoid unpredictability is wholly impossible.My days on this earth are numbered.Soon, I'll be gone, leaving behind my three kids and six grandchildren to join my departed husband.People will say I've lived a full life, like they did for my mother.They'll be wrong.~o~

So this is the afterlife.I take the time to scan my surroundings.A bit sparser than I expected.There's a smooth, concrete floor stretching as far as the eye can see, and a bright, white expanse covering everything above it.But aside from that?Nothing.I guess I'm meant to make my way to the final destination, right?There seems to be nothing else to do.The only question is, in which direction?After weighing the pros and cons of going to the left of this deserted landscape versus the right, I eventually settle on left.It isn't too long until I quite literally stumble on something.Picking myself off the floor, I examine this something and discover it's a book roughly the size of an average cat.The cover is gray and unusually textured to mimic concrete.Almost like someone left it here, intending to trip me.I open the book and flip to the first page.It is titled Your Life: The Book in big, black letters.My heart sinks.Is this it?The afterlife I hoped would be an escape from my stale existence is a book about it?Nothing else?I unenthusiastically start the story, seeing as I have no other choice.Three paragraphs into it, I realize it's one of those Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books.How fitting.Whoever created this must have thought it would be a treat.They're wrong, though.It's a treat for those who look back on their lives with nostalgic fondness.It's hardly worth seeing for someone like me.Still, I read on until page 369, the summer before senior year.I was sprawled on my bed, trying to figure out which college to attend.I had it narrowed down to two: Michigan State and the Royal College of Art in London, my dream school since age thirteen.I chose to go to Michigan State, though and gave up my chance to study photography there.It didn't pay as well as engineering, and if I was playing it safe, that just wouldn't do.My desire to continue fades and I toss the book aside.Is this really it?Is this life going to be as sour as the one before?How fair is that?I glare at the book as tears sting the corners of my eyes, wondering why I should be subject to this punishment.Where's Mother?Where's my husband?Where are all the friends that died before me?Why don't I get to see them?Minutes, or possibly hours, into my brooding, an idea blossoms in my mind.It is a tiny curiosity, nothing more than a little spark.I brush it aside and continue to wallow in my sadness.Meanwhile, the spark grows, slowly, at first, until it transforms into a raging inferno.Unable to resist my burning curiosity any longer, I reopen the book to page 369.To choose Michigan State University, go to pg.489.To choose the Royal College of Art, go to pg.421.Rubbing the page in between my fingers, I wonder what would've happened to me if I picked the second option.It wouldn't hurt to find out, would it?I flip to 421.
