Unification.A simple word, and one I had never given any amount of thought to.At least, not until today.I sipped my coffee, bleary-eyed as I completed my daily habit.Wars, murders, brilliant inventions turned into gruesome weapons, pollution, theft.All manner of sins, all types of evil.It's all the same.For nearly a decade, every single morning, I've combed through daily newspapers and found no real difference.Ideology, reasoning, ethical justifications, the end result is always the same.I've made a fortune pandering to people's filthy desires, investing into a market designed to help private interests rather than public prosperity and writing screenplays, novels, everything, with one simple message.Treat others as you wish to be treated.But no change.Nothing.As I stare at that single word, a proper noun rather than its usual common form, everything just seems so familiar.But now, I have a lead.Something to investigate.My position allows me access to a lot of information, information some might seek to destroy for the sake of their own vision for the world.As such, I contacted a few assets and put out requests for whatever they can dig up on Unification.With nothing left to do, I went about my day.As curious as I was, anxious to the point of shaking, there was nothing more to be done.For now.The next morning, for the first time in years, I skipped my daily routine.Instead, I began reading about this Unification, a mysterious billionaire who, seeking to conceal his identity, funded proxy wars, terrorist groups and social schisms with the intent of weakening world powers.Initially thought to be simply an exploitative, amoral and selfish psychopath, superhero raids on a database uncovered meticulous plans to unite the world by force.Preferably for each other, preferably with long-term mechanisms to ensure cohesion, but as a worst case scenario, against him and his private armies.The thought of the panic and riots this would cause was thought to be too much for the group, who generally preferred to redeem villains and make use of them for their vision of world progress.As such, after finding and redeeming him into a mere ignorant philanthropist, they destroyed all records they could find.Or so they thought.I lowered my coffee cup and sighed.What a waste of time my ignorance has been.Or was it me?It really doesn't matter, this was never about me.There's still work to be done.
