Inferno really didn't mind looking after the old bugger but the mornings were by far the thing I dreaded the most.The majority of the time it went off without a hitch, but when it didnt...

"Good morning Blaise"

The old man lying in the bed arose startled by the unfamiliar voice he had heard a thousand times before.'Who are you?"the old man said, trying the best to hide the fear in his voice, "and how do you know my name" 

Blaise laid upright in his bed, his body trembling, his hands shaking.It was always hard to the greatest hero of his time cower in fear, but no matter how super they are father time always catches up with them eventually."My name is Inferno and I have been sent here by the League of Heroes to look after you today"

*Please buy it, please buy it, please buy it...*

Blaise made a weary chuckled."Nice to see Terra Man hasn't forgotten about after all these years"

*Thankgod he bought it*

"But I don't need your charity", his tone suddenly becoming much sterner as he slowly raised himself from his bed.*Ohh fuck...*

"Do you know who I am?I am the man who defeated the Juggernaut and freed Peru from his Tyrannic rule, I am the man who who single-handedly closed the Death Zone after scores of heroes before me had failed."Blaises voice was now trembling as he spoke, getting louder with each word coming from his mouth."Heck I was the man who bought down the League of Demise and bought this earth the greatest era of peace it has ever seen!I dont need no help!GODDAMMIT, I A PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF LOOKING AFTER MY..!"Blaise didn't get to finish his sentence as his robe got in the dresser, leaving him hurtling towards the ground.As quick as he could, Inferno stretched out his arms, catching the heaps bones before he hit the floor.Infreno hated when this happened.At first occurrences like these were far and in-between but the more the Alzheimer progressed and more stubborn and irrational Blaise had become."You know once upon a time I could  fight 10 guys at once all on my own, now I can't even stay on my own two feet..." 

Blaise looked up at Inferno, tears welling in his eyes, his voice trembling."Look kid, just leave me be.I'm sure there are plenty of other things you want to do.You don't really want to be here."He was partially right.Inferno didn't want to be there, he needed to be there.After all, it was all his fault..It was supposed to be the perfect plan.Excalibur and Dark Lighting were to go uptown and create a havoc large enough to distract the League of Heroes while Inferno was down town stealing the Crown Jewels that were on display in the National Museum in broad daylight.Simple enough, but there was one thing we didn't factor in.An old retired Superhero who was down at the museum that day.The jewels were in the bag, Inferno was making his escape when the cry to "Stop in the name of Justice!"came out.Blaise stood there, relying heavily on his cane to remain upright.Inferno laughed there was no way the old timer could stop him, everyone knows your powers are the first thing that goes."What are you going to do to me Blaise?"he mocked "Flick some amber at me?"At that moment Inferno learnt a valuable lesson, super powers weren't the first thing a Superhero loses.It was their ability to control them.Inferno tried to keep the flames in check, but there was not much the young villain could do against the might of the hero Blaise.All he had meant to do was shoot a simple ball of fire in Infernos direction.Instead he had taken the lives of 27 innocent people and left half a city block destroyed.In the blink of an eye, the greatest hero the world had never know had become more infamous then even greatest villains had ever been.The people he had spent his life protecting wanted him to rot behind bars, while those he had spent his life serving with disowned him, more worried about protecting their public image than helping the man who had brought them together and established the League of Justice.A world he had loved so much, a world he spent his life protecting had forgotten him.But those he had spent his life fighting, those he had spent his life putting behind bars couldn't forget him, especially after he had taken down the League of Demise.They hated the man, but not even they could bear to watch the demise of man each of them respected even if none of them would openly admit it.They wouldn't let him rot, they wouldn't disown him.After all, someone had to look out of him..


.Bliase remained weeping in Infernos arms.He couldn't bear to leave him like this."Your right Bliase I don't want to be here"

He lifted Blaise onto the bed and looked into the old mans weary eyes, placing his hand on the old mand shoulder

"I don't want to be here" he repeated once more."I want to be out there on that front porch, with a cup tea in my hand while you tell me the story of how you managed to close that Dead zone.What do you say?"And as we had done every morning for the past 4 years, Blaise smiled.
