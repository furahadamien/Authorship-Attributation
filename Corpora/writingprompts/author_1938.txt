"I saw what happened just now, dad, " says my son.A few minutes earlier we were both stopped behind a building to throw some trash.I parked my car in front of a restaurant & leave my son inside.I walk along the dark alley towards the trash bin.It want exactly night yet the alley is dark enough.Luckily lights from the road shines through.I dumb the trash & started walking towards the car.Suddenly a man jump in front of me.He's holding a gun & pointing it out on me.I can't see his face.My mind goes on overdrive on how to escape this.This is robbery.I was sure of it.What he told me next was the final nail to the coffin."Give me your wallet!"he said.I don't pay any attention to the surrounding for help.I'm speechless & I'm not thinking soundly.Begrudgingly I gave him my wallet.He grabbed it from my hand, ruffle through it for a second.Not so sure what is going on but I'm fairly sure he chuckle a little.He move a step as if he was giving a path to run.I was ready to run, but he stopped me.He took out a few stuff from my wallet & handed it to me.It was my belonging.He then threw my wallet to the ground & unloading his gun on it.All I can see was the fire spark & my wallet dancing haphazardly on the ground.It was so fast.He turn to me & said "You're safe now."He then picked up my wallet & run the other way.He left me there with all my belongings.None of it he took with him.None but the wallet which he shot first before running away.I was all shook out until my son told me he saw what happened back then."With you alive here, dad; I'm missing my chance to become Batman myself."I was worry he'd be terrified or anything.Not in my wildest imagination he'd say something like that.What a child he is.
