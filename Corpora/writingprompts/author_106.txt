Where the hell am I?I asked as I realized I was out of breath.It felt like I had just ran ten miles.All that was around me was darkness and for some reason my muscles were sore.I saw a light flicker then instantly as if I was losing my mind.I noticed five hooded figures approaching.There was another flicker of light & red theater seats began to appear.At first there were five, the figures looked at me and said "Wait."Another seat appeared then another flicker of light occured & a floating theater screen appeared as if out of nowhere.One of the five began to step forward then suddenly stopped around ten feet away from me & said "Come take your seat.".There was something very unusual about this figure's voice.For some reason it sounded just like my own.I yelled "Who are you?"The same hooded figure from earlier whispered in my own voice saying "Ssh, the movie's about to start.You won't want to miss this."
