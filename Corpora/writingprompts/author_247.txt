There is a crucial aspect to conflict one must remember above all else; when victory is the desired outcome, all costs must be put on the line.If you truly seek your goal, you must be willing to sacrifice everything.Because if it comes down to it, that moment when you must choose between victory and survival the choice must be obvious.---

I wouldnt have been able to do it without him.Not that the task was impossible with only one person, but the sheer magnitude of the decision, the guilt of suffering the consequences  it was too much for my morality to endure.I still harbor some resentment, and I wish there was another way.But I have no regrets.If it was necessary, Id do it all again.The gnawing at the back of my head, telling me I was selfish and incompetent, never stopped.I accept it as punishment for my sin.No amount of atonement could justify the deaths of so many.I find it hard to believe, myself.The display had counted 7.9 billion  the outcome was so harsh that it was easier to count the survivors than try to comprehend the casualties.I suppose I must start at the beginning.---

My name is Daijiro Kojima.I grew up in Moni, a country town at the foot of a mountain.Our people disliked the modern world, and chose to abstain from the technologies of the so-called Western Man.My brother Kentaro disproved of this very much.He scolded our chief often for being ancient and dictatorial. I couldnt disagree with his accusations, as they were, to an extent, true.We held to old customs, and we clung to the advice and teachings of our chief.It was unsafe to wander outside the fence, thanks to the wolves roaming the forest, so we were largely restricted to wandering the farms and the streets.It was a peaceful life, though, and we ate well in the company of our families.Every week we gathered to pay tribute to the Effigy of the Mount, feeding it the fruits of our farms and cattle so it could sustain us with bountiful harvests.I didnt know how, but the soil here was different.To this day I was unsure of it, perhaps being a trick of the light or just my imagination, but the ground seemed to give off an ever so faint glow under the moon, just barely noticeable.I attributed the glow to be the spirit of the mount moving in the ground.Every year we reaped rewards that far exceeded the effort we put in.We thanked the chief for his leadership, and we thanked the mount for its generosity.We were merry and happy.---

Kentaro and I always trained with the village guardsmen, learning how to use the sword and be fleet of foot.The latter skills were always emphasized, as the chief said that our swordsmanship would be no match for the weapons of the outside world.The elders, those who travelled across the land and meditated in the fields, told us stories of the Western Man  I always wondered about the term, as they were apparently to the East and North too, even the South where the ocean is.Why call them Western if they are everywhere?But, I digress.The elders told us of the extensive range of their armaments, and the frightening speed of their attacks.It was something out of a magic story, I was sure.Kentaro told me he would protect me if the Western Man came to our village, but I always shrugged him off.We were both past childhood anyway.I was more than capable of protecting myself.But I never expected us to be the ones killing them.---

It happened while I was picking a primrose for mother.Id been growing one behind one of the storehouses, so it would be kept a surprise.She loved flowers, especially pink ones.It would make the perfect birthday present.It became dark so suddenly that I thought a vine had torn off the storehouse and fallen over me, but I looked up to see the clouds break apart and disappear, absorbed into a blackened sky.It was dark as night, and I stumbled through the leaves towards light.After feeling along the sides of building walls along the street for a while, amidst panicking women and screaming children, I found myself in the village square.Guards ran to and for with torches, yelling to each other and ushering civilians to safety.I saw my father carrying boxes with some other men.I was confused  why was the sky black?Had the sun run away before the moon was ready to wake?Was the Mount angry at us?And then Kentaro was by my side.Hey, Dai everythings going to be okay, hear me?Well figure this out.

I nodded.The chief stumbled past with a heavy box, but my brother caught him by the shoulder.Hey, old man, whats going on?Wheres the light gone?

Eyes wide, the chief turned to us.Get everyone you can find and gather them at the effigy.I had no idea they would return, not at a time like this.

What are you talking about?Are we under attack?

Ill explain everything later.The most important thing now is to get everyone to safety.Here, he fumbled in his pocked for a second and retrieved a small object, shoving it into Kentaros hand.Take this.Offer it to the effigy as you would a tribute.We need to protect everyone we can.

You got it, old man.Come on, Dai.

So we took a torch and scampered about, sending everyone we could at the effigy.Mother showed up too, and I suddenly remembered the primrose Id left behind the storehouse.She asked about our father, and we didnt see him there.More of the guardsmen were arriving, and he wasnt among them.Kentaro and I left to look for him, starting first at the barracks then progressing through the streets.We figured hed gone to the effigy while we were searching, so we started heading back.However, as we passed a farm we saw a dozen or so men staring at the sky.We followed their gaze and there, in the air above us, we saw the blackness move.It seemed to bend and shift, as if it was a giant piece of cartilage.Parts of it seemed to brighten slightly, and I saw a multitude of small specks appearing from the lighter parts.I watched as the specks grew larger, then realized they were distant objects heading towards us.Kentaro put his hand on my shoulder.Dai we should go.

But what are those?Birds?

Whatever they are, it cant be good.

For a second there was a bright flash amidst the objects, and a split second later the farmers screamed.The dirt around them erupted, spewing mounds of soil into the air.They scrambled back, running for the effigy.Kentaro and I didnt hesitate any longer.When we returned, the chief was waiting for us, more stressed than Id ever seen him.You left and took the key with you?!Do you have any idea of the risk you just put us in?! His loud voice drew several eyes from those around us.Oh, sorry this thing, right? Kentaro drew out the object hed been given before.It was about half the size of his palm, colored black and shaped like a disc, engraved with the face of a cat, just like the one on the effigy.They say that black cats are a sign of good fortune.And by the looks of things, were going to need all the fortune we can get.Yes yes yes  give it here! The chief snatched the disc from Kentaros hand and hurried over to the effigy, dropping it in the tribute slot.The disc would travel down a pipe and end up somewhere.I was unsure of where the tributes ended up but I was certain it wasnt underneath the chiefs house like some kids had joked.What now, old man? Kentaro asked, arms on his hips.Ken, show some respect. Father said, appearing from the group to slap Kentaro across the back.S-sorry, chief.

The chief was silent, instead speaking with a sly grin.The earth shook, forcing me to steady myself on Kentaros arm.The effigy broke open, splitting the cats face in two.There were several loud gasps and outcries from those gathered, but the chief urged them to calm down.The cracked effigy left a big hole in the ground, laden with steps that seemed to descend to the center of the earth.Everyone, follow me!Carry everything you can! The chief yelled, rushing down the hole and disappearing into the darkness, followed by the residents from the village.I looked back to the objects in the sky, which were approaching all the while.They mustve been a hundred miles when we first saw them, but I was sure they were a mere couple miles away now.I felt a pair of hands gripping my shoulders, moving me forward.Come on, Dai, lets go! Kentaro had a huge smile on his face, eyes wide.Brother..?

This is exciting, right?Something different is happening! Did he fail to notice the power of those things?Exploding the ground from so far away in an instant?He always was a strange one, I suppose.So we descended the steps, each of us carrying a box of supplies.Food, I think.We travelled for maybe 10 minutes, and I felt the temperature slowly dropping.I looked up and could no longer see the entrance nor feel the rumbling from the explosions.Eventually we reached a flat area of dirt, about the size of a house interior.The whole village crowded there, staring at the large wall opposite the end of the steps.It was made of metal, and shined so clearly that in the light of the torches, we could see our reflections.The wall was adorned with strange markings and indentations.The chief walked up to it, putting a hand against it.He sighed, as if in disappointment.I saw his lips move, but he made no sound.**PART TWO IN CHILD COMMENT**
