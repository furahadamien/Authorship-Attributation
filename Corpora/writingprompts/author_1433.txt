**B's Before H's 2:1**

And yea Chad sayeth unto Brad, 

"Bro, art thou not pumping the iron?"And Brad sayeth back,

"Surely bro, iron will not pump itself."Sayeth Chad, "Lo, were not we to be with the Lord to-day?""Bro, dids't thou not remember thine oath to the Lamb?Pump every day, every eve.""Surely, bro, the swole son of God not meanst to-day, the day of his supposed crucifixion?""Brosidon, the Temple of Iron guides us thus.We must worship today, as every day, if we are to have the strength to free our Lord from his shackles.""Verily bro, we shall tear the manacles from his holy wrists with our bare hands, after we've become strong before the Lord, and save the Lamb."And Chad thought, but verily had not been accustomed to this action."Bro, if the Lord is to be crucified to-day, shoulds't we not be there now?""Bro, can thou tear through iron with thou hands?""Soon I feel this I can do.""Then we pump we must, for if we err the Lord shall surely die and the world will weep."And Chad pondered thusly with great difficulty that somehow a flaw in their plotting existed yet could see no err.Thus he pumped, and Brad pumped, at it was good.
