In a world otherwise unsurprisingly normal, two heroes had come to an impasse.As each had done time and time again, both confidently began to exercise their inexplicable superhuman powers to get a leg up in life, but, just as everyone else on Earth, nothing seemed to emerge from their positive thinking.Very bold of you, Jeoff, to maneuver your sword in such a way!

Max had never fought in a real battle, despite his legacy of being the fastest dueler alive, but felt confident that his response was appropriate for the situation.Max!Your technique is exquisite!

And as Jeoff talked out of his ass, he pondered whether or not it was and if there was anyone around to witness the affair that could oppose him.An ancient ritual passed down by mankind led to this particular situation: the cracking of wishbones.You see, humans of this era believed that when two individuals pulled on the furcula of a fowl, one would be granted good luck depending on which side of the bone was longest and on which humans arm that dismembered them they ended up in.This is only partly true, but a common misconception.When the furcula of a fowl is pulled perfectly down the center, and only down the center by two humans participating in unison, one person on Earth is randomly selected to develop time-altering abnormalities, commonly understood at the time by the term superpower. Fortunately, this has ever only happened two times, and, luckily enough, in the same span of 10 Earth years.Unfortunately, this was the end of all life in the bi-dimensions.As both Jeoff and Max struggled to comprehend the magnitude of their actions, and also the most common human impulse to not get themselves killed, a very pitiful attempt at swordplay ensued for eternity by the planets two most prominent warriors.*Excerpt from the historical novel, Meaty Water-Bodies by Butt Glopbuloid*
