"I wasn't even that good.I mean I just made that stuff up.It's not very good.""Sure.Keep telling yourself that, Shakespeare."William Shakespeare sat in his booth in the diner and let his head hit the Formica table top.He was never leaving here was he?Purgatory wasn't a thing like how I'd expect.It looked like a Jersey diner.Chrome and Formica as far as the eye could see.Made good pancakes though.Everyone sat around waiting.Waiting.And waiting some more.When I first got here I was excited.Here was a ton of authors and artists and musicians.Legends from all walks of life.I mean I could sit down and talk to Ernest Flipping Hemingway or John Lennon.But dear god what a bunch of whiners.Oh I just want to die.Let me die.Why can't I move on?Call the waah-bulance, amirite?When I got here everyone was also a dick.I tried talking to F. Scott Fitzgerald about Gatsby.He started ranting and raving about how freshmen English is ruining his death.He then called me a short timer.I'd only have to be here for 70, 80 years tops.Once my immediate family died I'd move on.But guys like Shakespeare over there will be in the diner forever.As long as people remember him he'll be here.Some people like Plato have been here so long that they've gotten pretty Zen about it.They see this as their heaven.I'm sitting with Shakespeare eating my pancakes and drinking my coffee when I hear a bell.Somewhere in the infinite diner, there's someone coming in.New guest.Don't worry theres a table available.There always is.
