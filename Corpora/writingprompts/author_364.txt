[WP] Even though I was told about the letter during my first week in office, I couldn't believe it when it actually arrived.I called the number and waited for the car.Simple, no thrills, nondescript and driven my an unremarkable chauffeur.Why wouldn't it be?No one's focusing on an ex President.Time moves on.Certainly, no-one expects that I'm about to   meet the people who really control things.Not just The United States, but the World.As we drive in silence, I think about the subterfuge that all ex Presidents must have experienced.I couldn't even utter a hint to Michelle.She wouldn't have believed if I did.JFK.What will he look like now?Would his existence be too much for the unsuspecting public.If they knew what I'm about to experience, would it blow their minds?Four hours later, we cross the US/Canada border.And I mean cross.No stop, no questions, no passports.This is real power.Another  two hours and we pull off into a forest.I don't see the guards, but I know they're here, because the driver periodically flashes a beam to unseen phantoms, who respond in kind.Eventually we enter a tunnel and descend at an alarming rate  for what seems like and hour.Who could have built this and how come no one knows about it even in the highest echelons of government?We stop and the driver ushers me out.We enter a stairwell and walk along a long, lit corridor.The drive disolves away as a door opens and were greeted by a familiar statesman-like, silver-haired gentleman, although  I can't quite place him.in tge small room sits John F. Kennedy.He stands up and shakes my hand firmly.He's unquestionaby aged, but that strong spirit and resolve is still apparent.He addresses the other man, 'Lyndon, introduce Barack to Julius.Time to blow his fucking mind.
