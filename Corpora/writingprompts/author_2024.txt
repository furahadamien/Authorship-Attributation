[Poem] 


No-one sympathizes like Death himself.Long before life knew it had an ending, 

The first death occurred.It was sudden, shocking, and lonely.The first casualty of mankind 

Felt his pains fade away, 

Then found himself on a pathway.He began to walk, then jog, then run,

Hed never been so alone before.The lack of warmth and sound 

Stood as the first ever haunting, 

Whispering in his ear silently, 

No-one will be at the end.

He got to the end of the path,

And found that he was still alone.Even the afterlife was deserted.He stayed there for

What was only a few seconds, 

But what felt like centuries, 

And his soul aged from the loneliness.He was merely bone, and covered himself, 

With a cloak to help him remember 

What it was like to feel warmth.He suddenly heard the cries 

Of what sounded like hundreds of people.His soul slowly floated towards the sounds until 

He found himself at a battle field.He looked over and saw

The souls of a few soldiers, 

Curled up next to their bodies in panic.Sympathy overcame him

As he remembered how afraid

He felt when his body rejected him.Silently, he floated over to the closest soul,

And held out his hand.The soldier looked up at him, 

A bit afraid, but took his hand.Lets go together.It will make the journey 

Much more peaceful.
