The brightness of the world had startled me when it first came back, my eyesight that is.Nobody could see, that's what the news had said, that's what they all had said.They'd called it The Great Blinding.Well, if that is the case then why is mine suddenly back?These questions flying around my mind, I had seen only darkness for the past 2 years, and now I was seeing words written everywhere, 6 words.The same 6 words everywhere.On every available surface, not a single area left untouched by the words, like an infestation of termites except instead of leaving nothing in their wake, they leave these 6 words.What does it mean?Who is 'them', is it the blind?Is it someone else?Something else?I shivered as that last thought rattled through my mind.What if it wasn't something human?But surely someone would have noticed something being off by now?A man suddenly started looking around, amazed.He yelled out "I can see, I can see!!"The man started dancing gleefully.I saw it before he did.The thing.Its body convulsing in a magesticaly disgusting way, it looks to be a human now I take a second look at it, but it is so far twisted and so far gone from what we know as our human form that you have to look twice to realise it even resembles a human.No facial features where eyes, lips and nose would be, instead a grotesque display of rows upon rows of teeth in a gaping hole where the brain and head would have been housed, any hair that one was on the creature replaced by only a bald scalp, the creature's skin almost transparent from the back of its head and down to its feet, if you can call them that.The lack of any cloth covering the creature left nothing to the imagination, ears covering its whole lower body from the waist down, looking like suction cups until you look again, a black heart beating in the middle of where I would imagine its chest to be, the only thing asides from its mouth face that isn't almost completely transparent on the creature.It writhed for a second in place before its face opened up, and it sucked the 6 foot human male into its teeth.I wish I could tell you where the man went, he disappeared as he got past the rows of teeth.Didn't even get the chance to yell in surprise.No sounds.I watched in horror as a new ear started to grow from just above the waistline, where the other ears stopped, growing to a huge size before almost popping as if it were a balloon, and shrinking to the size of the other ears.I covered my mouth in horror, as I realised that the ears were probably one for each devoured human.I felt like vomiting right there on the pavement covered in the words."Don't Tell Them You Can See".It all made sense now.Whatever the hell these creatures were, I was going to find out and take them down now.Nothing was going to get in my way... except maybe finding out that this is the eventual fate of the people whose eyesight returns, as a very lovely old man whose eyesight had returned 27 days ago told me, 10 days later when I found some more humans whose eyesight had returned at some point.They all verified his story.28 days after your sight returns, you lose your humanity.You become one of those creatures.Which fate is worse?I think, knowing what I know now, I would have rather preferred to keep my blindness.
