"Even today, the exact mechanics of the S314 therapy is still unknown.In fact, until the introduction of the S314 therapy, the debate about the exact process of aging seemed to be one of the few things that is immortal.S314 didn't really provide a conclusion for the debate \- it just provided the tired and jaded academics an excuse to sweep the arguments under the rug.For The Eternal Generation, aging is a term that had lost its relevance.

San Francisco \- 2089 

"Perhaps S314 not only stops physical aging, but also slows aging psychologically," I thought to my self as I sighed quietly.Danny, an academic rich in his fervor and completely oblivious of the atmosphere, rambled about genes and computers for the 162th time since the dissolution of UC Berkeley."You see Lang, aging is a lot like that rusty calculator box of yours," said Danny as he knocked on the PC I had built seven years ago."That calculator box you are knocking are made from old parts I auctioned off from Lawrence Hall of Science.You might want to be more gentle with it old pal," I complained as I called my household android over to wipe the glass panel of my PC."Sorry bud.Didn't think you still have such a penchant for old stuff.Anyway, back to what I am discussing.Computers sometimes have their files corrupted right?And when that happens, errors start to accumulate and one day, BOOM, your computer have some system files corrupted and run into a fatal error.Now how do you prevent such corruptions from happening?""You don't.You put corruption into your consideration and back up your files.Some enterprise folks even used something called an ECC memory back in the days that actively fixes erroneous bits in operation," I replied."And that is the new proposed theory for the mechanics of S314!Human aging, in essence, is the same corruption of information in the DNA.S314 backs up the information in your healthy, pre\-26 DNA and actively restore your DNA to its original state if it sensed any changes!"exclaimed Danny."At least that explains why all the children look nearly the same nowadays.Probably because the magic molecule from their parents did a 'system restore' right?"I asked sarcastically.And for the 162th time since the dissolution of the university, Danny replied while sipping his tea: "You actually bought into that crap from those Lost Generation protestors?No, the pill does not periodically reset your memory or cause your children to be clones of their parents.And no, the government didn't give out the pills to create a country of string puppets.""What happened to those protestors anyway?I haven't seen them on the news lately.Did they pass away?"I asked Danny."Oh I nearly forgot," said Danny as he waved the holographic notebook into existence, "Those L Genners got what they wanted.They were jealous at E Genners' immortality, but now they can be immortal too.We just had a breakthrough in the mind upload research and the government pushed out an initiative to upload all L Genners' conscious into the new prototype androids just like your Isla there," Danny said as he pointed to the silver haired android wiping my old PC."Wait, so they all agreed?"I asked, an uneasy feeling rising in my throat."Well, you see, when L Genners like you get old, they sometimes suffer lapses of memory, remembering things that never existed or seeing hallucinations.This can be a social concern, so the government made it compulsory to upload your body to a safer and more manageable vessel.And this this is why I am here today.I brought the Acknowledgement Form here as well.Come on, sign it quickly.The volunteers are waiting for you outside."I looked outside the window.There is a black sedan in front of my house, and two burly men wearing black suits stepped out.This is the last sight I saw as Lang.
