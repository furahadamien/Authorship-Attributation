[On mobile, will reformat later].[Story complete, many fixes on the way.]Melvin and Marlene had been living as a happy couple, roaming the Continental US as regular tourists, taking in all the sights to be seen at every city of every state, to occupy their time awarded them for just so happening to be century-old vampires.They could spin a yarn of stories so long that it could wrap up the Empire State Building as some sort of festive cozie.Or at least, they thought so.That's the next destination for this adventurous couple.The Big Apple.The sights, the smells, the food, the... *other* food... etc.Having booked a red-eye flight to the big city, Melvin and Marlene were very anxious.Miami was a hot and, frankly, very sunny place.More sun means more sunscreen, and applying sunscreen by the handful every thirty minutes is a lot of trouble.Sure, brimmed hats make life easier, but how do you swim with one of those!?New York, New York was the perfect place to go.Further north, less sun, lower medical bills on account of burns.It's very hard to relay your medical history as a vampire.One can't exactly admit that their auntie Griselda has been prone to frequent fainting due to a change of diet in the early 1600's.The young-looking couple shuffle off of their plane, make their way through baggage claim, and head off to their appointed destination.They had rented a small apartment for a few months because they could no longer make use of their minibus as a sort of "home base" in such a blustering metropolis.This traffic was atrocious, and parking meters are more tedious to pay off than a blood pact with a wendigo.The overpayed taxi driver drops the Caves off at the intended complex for their three month stay, and they make their way to room 101, the landlord's personal room.They knock, and a short lady in pink answers the door."Wowee, when you said late, you weren't kidding!Did the plane fly across the Pacific!?""Sorry, miss Anderson, we couldn't, ah, *afford* to take a day plane.""What do you mean?Shouldn't day and night flights be about the same?And if you can't afford a plane ticket, what makes you think you can afford rent in such a city as this?"Marlene didn't know how to respond.It's hard to apply sunscreen IN a plane, let alone bring it in her carry on through the checkpoint.She smiled nervously.And awkwardly.*Just drop it, lady!*, she thought.*You're making me incredibly uncomfortable!*  
Miss Anderson seemed to get the point.She turned to the more silent partner of the Caves."You must be Mr. Melvin, I presume?Cat got your tongue?""More times than I care to count, ma'am."She chortled.*What a strange man.What a strange* ***couple***.Miss Anderson showed them to room 306, their designated living quarters for the next three months.A quick tour, and she was out.3:30 am doesn't wear well on the older folks, and Miss Anderson was older than she liked to admit.Melvin and Marlene looked around a while.Fridge, beds, sofa, TV, you name it, it was there.They were ecstatic.This was their first time to actually stay IN a  city, rather than near one.Night flights were going to be so gorgeous, and watching the new year's fireworks from on top of a skyscraper rather than on TV or from the ground?Priceless.Marlene needed to get out, even if for just a few minutes.The weather was sublime, and if she flew high enough, she might even see the stars.She told Melvin she was going out."Hmmmmm.... Go for it.I'm rather in the mood for a nap."Marlene opened the window and jumped off the balcony.She fluttered towards the heavens, and dove into the ever-active city.It was like soaring through a tunnel of lights, a florescent valley.Exhilarating, haphazardous, and ever so gleeful, Marlene graced the skies with self-named "Woopdi Do's" and "Whirly Bird's."She had her fun, but she needed to get back home.She lands on the window sill, and immediately realizes a problem."Melvin.... May I come in?""...What do you-...Damn."How exactly do you explain that you need your landlord to be the one to put a welcome mat on your balcony?
