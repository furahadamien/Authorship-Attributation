I honestly just shrugged and went along with it, y'know?Mom thought I didn't know what she was up to.Was Hogwarts real?Absolutely.Dad told me stories about the quidditch matches and the teachers there outside of all the books.Except, he kept talking about Ilvermorny, not Hogwarts.Sure, there was a class trip to Hogwarts, but my dad never actually attended.See, I think mom had no idea that magic even existed, that dad was just doing sleight of hand and the like.I had known she was faking and never actually knew dad was a wizard, but one time, she crossed the line.It was when my dad and I were in the backyard tending to some plants in his illusory area, hidden from sight.Suddenly, an eagle landed with a letter in its mouth.A telegram from Ilvermorny.I was thrilled!Finally, I was going to become a wizard just like my dad!We decided to head inside and head over to the American equivalent of Diagon Alley when mom opened the front door qith a handful of mail, along with a painfully obvious fake letter."James!Look!A letter from Hogwarts!You're gonna be a wizard!""Sharon, we need to talk-"

"Timothy, come on!Our boy's going to be a wizard!Isn't this exciting?!"Mom said as she elbowed him in the ribs.I could see her stifling a grin.I took the letter and opened it.Dumbledore wrote it?Yeah, this was obviously faked, he was dead."Mom I-"

"I know, I'm sorry I opened it before you, but I already got tickets for us to head to London and see you off at King's Cross!So you meed to pack your bags, I already picked up your wizard robes!"Okay first off, if she had just gotten the mail, how could she- Oh, she got a halloween outfit, gotcha.I looked over concerned at dad as mom ran to her room, probably to pack."Dad...But I need to go to Ilvermorny!""Look son, I'll try telling your mother, but you know how she is.She's a no-mag that grew up on the books, the histories.Her parents told her it was fiction.It's her idea of a funny joke.She probably thinks you won't go through the collumn and she'll laugh it off and try to take you to a bunch of places in London afterwards to make up for it.""But I'll miss orientation!I want to go to Ilvermorny, not Hogwarts!You said it yourself, Hogwarts is full of stuck up British people who think they're better than everyone else because they have the boy who lived!"Dad rubbed his temples."Look son, they really are, but I mean, I'll talk to her.Now, let's say you and I head to Shaman Way, okay?"I had bought all my ilvermorny stuff, even my own wand.I met some of my future classmates and they were awesome, quirky, and goofy.Honestly it felt like I was meeting characters out of a book, but that's just the eccentricity of wizards.Dad never convinced mom, so we ended up going to London.Dad called one of his old classmates who was working at the Ministry of Magic to tell him the situation.A simple teleportation spell after I went through the pillar would have me at Ilvermorny.Apparently, this kind of thing is pretty common.We arrived at Platform 9, of course there were a bunch of no-mags there taking pictures and laughing.A security guard came up and warded everyone away, and then I saw some other kids heading there.I turned to my mom, her phone out ready to take a picture of me with my halloween outfit, holding my dad's old bigger-on-the-inside suitcase."Mom, I can take you with me, you know?We can go to Hogwarts together, you know?""Sweety, I'm a muggle!I can't go through there!"She wasnt even trying to hide the laughter this time.I looked over at dad, who just shrugged."Listen I told you it'd be more believable if we took him to Grand Central in New York, Sharon.He's American, not British."I sighed, and dad gave me a thumbs up from behind his jacket, hidden from my clueless mother.I started to walk towards the pillar."No sweety!Run!You have to run into the pillar, remember?"I just dashed in a full sprint and disappeared beyond the illusory wall, the last thing I heard was my mother screaming as I was caught by a conductor."Aye lad, ye must be James Barnes then?Your da' said ye needed to head to Ilvermorny instead of Hogwarts, aye?"The books didn't do it justice, the hidden part of the station was maginificent, the Hogwarts express standing there puffing out steam like a dragon.For a moment, I was in awe.I looked back up at the Conductor."Yes sir, sorry, my mom thought it would be funny to record me running into the pillar..."

"Aye lad, a lot of parents do.Well then, looks like you'll be riding the Ilvermorny Zephyr then instead of this old piece of ir'n then?Better get you to Grand Central.""Wait, I thought I was going to Ilvermorny-"

"Ye are, but... erm...Currently we're having issues with the teleportation spell to get there..."

Thus was news to me... Something was wrong.Maybe I shouldn't go, then.A thousand thoughts went in my head, and then I realized: This was MY adventure, and I had to start it right."Alright sir, I'm ready."And with a few words, I felt myself appear in front of an equally magnificent train, a conductor with a stopwatch in his hand looked at me."James Barnes?""Yes?""You're .2 seconds early, hurry up and get on the train, or you'll be walking to Mount Greylock."As I boarded the train I looked back and saw my dad holding my very confused mother, waving at me.She looked up at him, obviously trying to stop cyring."It's all real?""Yes dear, it is.And our son is part of it."I waved to my parents.My dad waved back.I'd see them again soon.But for now, it was time for me to start my own adventure.
