Two things I should tell you about my recently deceased Gran.First, she was a bit eccentric, but harmlessly so.Second, she had a penchant for writing everything down--recipes, reminders, phone numbers, you name it.So it came as little surprise that when she passed, she had willed me a cookbook among other things.I figured I'd try a recipe one rainy fall afternoon, and I thumbed through the cookbook looking for something tasty to ward off the cold.*Bingo, chicken soup!* I smile fondly as I remember Gran cooking it for my sister and I when we were younger.I read the ingredients aloud to myself--a habit born in recent years from forgetfulness--and as I reach the bottom of the list, a blackish-purple light appears above my stove.The light grows brighter and bigger, and eventually, *something* steps out of the light and onto my stove.Had I not been equally shocked at it's appearance and annoyed by the now completely melted stove top, I'd have been struck by this being's beauty.Whatever it was, it was the most ravishing thing I had ever seen."Mortal.You are barely into adulthood, and you have brought me to your realm.How is it you have done this?"The being's voice was smooth as silk and light as a feather, but simultaneously instilled a deep uneasiness within me.I gather what's left of my wits as I try to think of a response."I was cooking dinner..." I say confused."I was reading the ingredients for my Gran's soup, and..."

"A moment, mortal."The being appraises me now with a mix of hesitation and respect."The book you read from.Was it your grandmother's?""Yes, but how did you know--"

"You read of Her writing and summoned me without destroying yourself utterly, although I cannot say the same of your summoning platform.You ARE of Her blood, then."The being now smiled, and this time as it spoke, I no longer felt the sense of dread.Rather, I felt completely at ease and began to get a good look at whatever (or whomever) just wrecked my stove.It was as though every single person I'd ever found attractive--woman AND man--had somehow merged into one being and could cycle through them as one shuffled through songs in a playlist."It has been quite some time since I have visited the realm of Earth.I am honored to be in your presence, Awakener.""I'm sorry, Awakener?What do you mean by that?Who are you?"The look of confusion on my face must have amused it, and it smiled and giggled."Only an Awakener can call upon my kind.The uneducated among you mortals would call us daemons, but your grandmother was one of the few to understand our true nature.We exist in the minds and hearts of all mortals, manifesting as your need to procreate, your hearts' desires, and what you call your libido.However..." It pauses and looks me over with a sultry grin."However...?"I inquire, my irritation at my destroyed stove lessening and being replaced with all manner of pressing questions and thoughts."Some mortals were wise enough to realize what we were.What our true power is.What we can do for you mortals...and what we can do *to* you."It smiled again, and began to speak once more in an almost lusty growl."My kind have no true name...only what the Awakeners call us when they summon us.Your grandmother called me Chrysanthemum--Chrys for short.But now that I am yours, you must give me a name of your own choosing.Do this, mortal, and I am yours."*That'd finally explain all the chrysanthemum shrubs Gran used to grow...* I muse to myself.I take a moment to gather my thoughts.My Gran, the sweetest, most innocent old lady anyone ever knew, was some kind of summoner (or Awakener) and a recipe for chicken soup had brought forth both the destruction of the best stove I'd ever had along with a being that was humanity's lust made manifest.And now this being was offering itself to me in exchange for a simple name?I finally spoke up, breaking the silence."I would call you Dahlia.It's a flower too, and I think Gran would like that."I grin slightly as Dahlia moves closer to me."So...what now...?""First we must repair your summoning platform.I would ask your forgiveness, Awakener; when we are first brought forth into the mortal realm, the process can be damaging.But the first time is always the most difficult, yes?"It giggles at its own joke."To summon me now, simply say my name when alone, and I can come to you.""Hmm...OK." I pause a second."By the way, you can call me Douglas.The whole 'Awakener' thing sounds a bit medieval.""Of course, Douglas."As it says my name, I feel blood rush through my body and I feel a warmth inside my chest as Dahlia approaches and embraces me."Let us repair your platform, and afterwards, we shall begin your Guidance.I have *ever* so much to teach you."-------------------------------------------------------------------

**This went somewhere I didn't think it was gonna go, but I had fun writing it.Feedback's appreciated--I've written for a few prompts on here over the months, and I'm thinking of writing more regularly on here.**
