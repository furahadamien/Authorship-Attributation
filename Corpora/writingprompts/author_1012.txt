I dont even know if my father is alive anymore.Its terrible, not knowing, the emptiness in your heart, your mind that only closure can fill.All I get instead are horrid, unthinkable scenarios of what happened to him, nightmares I cant escape even when I open my eyes to start each day.Nightmares even worse than the destruction I see every direction I look.And here I am, in an abandoned mine on Mars, tracking the last hint my dwindling wallet could get me.It feels like I am falling further and further behind a ghost; every hint I find of him, it looks like he is further and further  and that much closer to being gone forever.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Dad, you have to eat something, I say.*

*He stares blankly ahead and shakes his head absently.*

*I put the package of Oreos on the table.He looks at it, but it doesnt seem to register in his eyes.*

*Do you remember the story you told me when you gave me my first Oreo?You said you met at a college party, and you found Mom eating Oreos, like a cute little chipmunk.Do you remember that?*

*I cant tell if his eyes are glassy, or watery, or if he is even moving.*

*Thenyou asked when the last time she had eaten an Oreo, because she was eating them like it was her last day on Earth.And then she looked guilty, and said she had eaten them yesterday.And thats when you knew.You told her if she went out with you, she could have all the Oreos she ever wanted.*

*He looks at me, an almost imperceptible movement of his head.*

*I know shes gone, Dad, but thats not your fault.And she wouldnt want you to do this to yourself.*

*I take an Oreo out of the package, and give it to him.*

*He looks at it for a moment, and then back at me.And finally, it seems like he sees me.He smiles, just a little wrinkle at the corner of his mouth, but it's a smile nonetheless, and for the first time since the crash, I think everything might just be okay.*

The cave is dark, but finally, at the end of it, under the drip of some cold, infested water, I see it.A small campsite, just ash and the Oreos.Cockroaches and other creatures I don't want to know about scatter as I walk over.The notice on the delivery says that the package came four months ago.I open it up.Inside, there is a note, and a few moldy Oreos left.I read the note, and sigh as my heart is filled with hope, just enough to keep my rusted, corroded heart going, to the end, to answers, to whatever awaits.*Youre closer than you think.Dont give up.Love  Dad.*

What is wrong, my child?

Silence.You know the words spoken at Confession will never leave this room.

Itit hurts, High Priest.

What hurts?

This doubt.

What do you doubt, child?

I doubteverything.It is as if all the truths I once believed in were merely a house of cards, and now a breeze has come and blown the house down.

And what is this breeze?

The godsI once saw only strength, bravery, boldness without any fear.Now I only see the strain in their muscles, the doubt in their eyes.

My childare you suggesting?

A trial, the boy said quietly.My child, you must know what this means.The consequences

I am ready to accept them, father.

So for weeks the boy practiced, out in the ponds in the Forbidden Valley he snuck out to in the mornings before lessons.Every time he entered the water, he would curse himself, almost hoping that it would not be true.But then in the water, he found peace.Found the only peace, perhaps, that he had ever known.It was as if he could perfectly feel the air in his lungs, the oxygen, coursing through him, clean and vital, and hear all the quiet machinery of his body, his heartbeat, his veins, the sway of his limbs.And then eventually, the oxygen would be gone, and he would resurface.And he would close his eyes before looking at the numbers, only to see and know with growing conviction that all he had been told before was a lie.\-

The last person he looked to was his mother.She smiled bravely while his father could not even look at him, but the boy could see the fear, the sadness in her eyes.He would enter the water, and then come out as an exile, an outcast, orsomething else entirely.And then it was time.He squeezed her hand, trying to let her know he was still her son.As he was lowered into the water, he saw her turn away, her hands over her eyes.The water.Quiet and peace from all the chatter and murmurs above him.He tried to still his nerves, his wildly beating heart, the tremors and tingles that kept flaring up in his fingers.He tried to count, but somewhere along the way he was going too fast or too slow, and he gave up.But still, he held on, determined tohe didnt know what drove him so, but he closed his eyes and stood still in the water tank until his lungs felt like bursting, felt like fire and pain and

He rose, and the crowd was silent.As he climbed out of the water onto the platform, he knew something was wrong.And then they all knelt, one by one.His mother first, then the elders, theneveryone.His father.His childhood friends.Eventually, the High Priest.Oh, Great Guinness, thank you for gracing us with the presence of a new God, the Champion of Holding Air

He heard the people he had known all his life, loved and hated and envied and walked past without a second thought, pray to him, lauding his greatness, his elevation above their existence, and a new belief came to him.The lie beneath the truth, the fact that the Gods were nothing but mortal humans, like everyone, and that his life would never be the same.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
