In all my eras, of all the apprentices I'd ever trained, Pete was the most impatient.His lack of focus made him insightful, and he'd sometimes grow unique and truly beautiful ecologies.More often it brought him terrible difficulties in mastering even the most basic lessons."I keep telling you," I told him, "you're harvesting too early.""I was just trying to do some pruning," Pete objected, reflexively."See?I'm still leaving the richest ones to grow ripe.Look at that these guys over here -- they are going to be prime!Better than anyone else's in the whole academy!"Pete indicated a community of humans that had colonized nearly an entire continent of a small planet he'd been farming.He was correct: The growth on that little patch of planet was exemplary in form and function.Healthy, vibrant, and fecund, it was as fine a specimen as anything I myself had ever grown."Growing a few prime humans, in one continent of one planet, is not the purpose of our academy here, Pete.That's not our goal."I tried to sound compassionate -- or at least not envious."The purpose is to feed ourselves --- not for one fine feast, but for every day!The goal is to grow enough food that we do not have to hunt.Pete continued to watch over his little planet, but I felt like he had heard me and was trying to think of what to say next."You know Pete, that really is as fine a community of humans as I've ever seen -- here at the academy or out in the wild.I really do not mean to take away from that in any way"

His eyes seemed to brighten, though almost imperceptibly.I continued."That continent is as perfect as I've seen, but look at this one -- it's so overgrown with humans that they are all sickly and weak.And then on this continent, so sparsely populated with any life at all, the humans are few, and they are all lead tough and stringy lives.There's no flavor -- no good nutrition in that at all."I'd lost any of Pete's remaining attention by then though, as I had in so many previous lectures.In the abstract, I'm sure he heard me and knew I was correct, but in the here-and-now, he just couldn't take his attention off of that one beautiful little community he'd grown.All that was left for me to give him another admonishment, which I already knew he wouldn't really hear."You get the most life, and therefore the most food, when there is balance.The way you've been snacking on this continent here and that one there, it's is not healthy for the system as a whole.When there is too much disparity between the weak and the strong in a system, the strong will feed on the weak.When the weak are consumed, the strong then go hungry and grow weak as well.""Balance is a better way," Pete quoted the academy's ancient founder."When we control our sustenance, our sustenance does not control us."But Pete wasn't a farmer.Pete was a hunter -- like the rest of us, despite our cultural evolution and farming academies and all the rest of it.He was a hunter, like me.
