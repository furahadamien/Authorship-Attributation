Ugh its happened again, another vigilante that takes it upon himself to stop me and another hole Im forced to dig before leaving town.The real pain in the ass is moving again.This is the fourth time this year and Im truly dreading the thought of packing and unpacking.They call themselves heroes.These masked freaks that go around meddling in another persons business.For the most part I dont mind them.Theyre usually too busy catching the loud and stupid morons the city considers criminal masterminds.Unfortunately for me I popped up on *his* radar.Once these heroes have their sights set on you theres no shaking them.They become obsessed with you.The last guy I had to get rid of was a prime example.He was able to track me past state lines.I must admit I did have some fun trying to lose him.Didnt expect him to have a teenage sidekick though.I buried them together.Kids werent ever really my thing.I had to lay low for a while after that.They turned out to be high-profile victims.Ever since then I dont take any chances.If anyone of these heroes was half as good as the bat freak I would be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life.It all started last week while I was watching TV.I was enjoying Seinfeld reruns when the breaking news alert interrupted my Soup Nazi episode.Was going to shut it off and go to bed but then I saw the bag on the screen.I knew the second I saw it what was going on.Its my fault really, didnt check the forecast this time around.To think the body would washup after the storm, I knew I should have added more weight to the bag.Not thinking twice, I started to pack and was half way to my closet when I heard his voice.I couldnt believe it the prick was on TV going on about justice and making promises to the city he wasnt going to keep.He just had to get involved.He called himself the Blue Defender.If you couldnt tell by his name law enforcement loved the guy.He was at their fundraising events, the policeman ball, they even gave him the key to the city.This made him easy to find.Oh yeah, the same day I moved in to the city I did my research.Took me three weeks to find out his identity.Jeremy Murphy, good old Jere had a life outside of the Blue Defender.A job, friends, family, hell even a girlfriend.Got to give it to him he was making this hero thing look easy.I sat on all this information until today until I needed to use it.I moved in on his girlfriend first.Dont worry shes alive I dont need any more attention drawn to me.She works out of the Starbucks off Third and Main.You guessed it shes a writer.Its strange to me how much we are creatures of habit.Every Tuesday Jeremy and Monica meet up at Starbucks for lunch from 12:15 to 12:45 they talk about work and laugh a bit then they kiss and say their goodbyes and Jeremy walks back to work.He always takes the same route back.He passes an alley where an old homeless man has set up shop begging for money.And every Tuesday he gives the homeless man his leftovers and his change.This time the old man was sitting against the wall with his head sunken into his chest.He is deeper in the alley than usual.Jeremy calls out to him.No response.He walks up to him and checks his pulse nothing.Takes out his phone to call an ambulance but before he can dial 9 the knife was already half way in his neck.I dragged him and hobo Joe back to my truck.Cleaned up the alley the best I could making sure I got all the blood.Drove an hour out of town to this old abandoned factory and started to dig.I buried them together.God how I hate moving tonight is going to be a pain in the ass.
