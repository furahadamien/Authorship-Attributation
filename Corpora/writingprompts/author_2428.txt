The sight of a soul fading from the eyes is what drives my near-animal instincts.In a world full of jokes, riddles, and two-faced miscreants, who am I to stir the pot?I am here for a purpose, and one purpose only...to preserve the status quo.Do not get me wrong.I don't suppose to have a purpose on this planet.All I know is what I feel, and what I feel is to strangle every last drop of empathy from this planet.Cold, calculating, precise, relentless, etcetera.That's how quite a few scrupulous characters would bother to describe how I behave, but they have yet to fathom who I truly AM.I do not subscribe to any form of human nature in the quest to describe myself, my being, my essence.Entirely selfless am I in the quest to erase human existence from the face of Earth.Cockroaches but are we, finding any rock to hide under whilst 'praying' our newfound shelter will provide us solace from the ever flowing tides we call life itself.Humanity is fragile and weak.I only seek to root out, and extinguish, the plight of our Mother Earth.They call me villainous, but is that truly what I am?Is someone who wants the planet to thrive and flourish an enemy of the people?Is someone who wants the end of suffering an enemy of the people?This planet, this mound of birth and decay we call Earth, is nothing more than a womb.A womb which we, humanity, have no respect for and take every chance we get to hack up for personal gain and the 'prospect' of human advancement.We bleed the planet dry of resources and, even though she is not able to scream, continue to eviscerate her without a second thought.When we realize what we have done and how permanent the damage is, it will be too late to fix anything.This is where I step in.I am no social justice warrior by any means, nor am I some life preserving pansy.I exists purely for my own survival, and if that means murdering tens, hundreds, or thousands along the way...I harbor no qualms, for I live not for myself.What I can contribute to, on a day to day basis, is the fundamental idea that most of nature deserves a place to carve out their life and the lives of those whom they hold dear.Now I don't murder recklessly.I don't take life without cause, nor do I strike out of vengeance...but when an animal bares its teeth at me, I respond in kind.These Heroes...these self-described saviors of the human race...what a fucking joke.They may claim that they exercise their powers for the betterment of the human race but we all know the only thing they're after....notoriety.Their claim to fame is daily acts of empty altruism that only propagate the continual suffering of our sweet Earth by allowing the toxic scum that call themselves 'human' to continue over-populating the planet.It is my responsibility, nay, my duty, to rid Earth of any and EVERYONE who seeks to continue its destruction.I need to rid Earth of the virus known as man, and anyone who protects them.Not only am I the destruction of man-kind and those who protect them...I'm Captain Planet.
