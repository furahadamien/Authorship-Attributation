"Oh shit oh shit-"

"What is it?Calm the hell down T."

"It's him, it's-it's Warren!""No it can't-, what?THE Warren?""Yes THE Warren, we're sorry sir.We didn't know you were in here!"the shaking man in the ski mask told me."Honest mistake sir," the other bank robber yelled from the counter, "have a nice day!"I'd not understood then.But I did now.It corroborated a lot of events that had been happening in the past few years.Small subtle things like preferential treatment at a coffee place or how my friends kept telling me how lucky I was that I would always get the first job offer or apartment I applied for.I'd always chalked it all up to good fortune but this event.The robber calling me "THE Warren", meant that, to their group or at least to someone, I was important.Important enough for bank robbers to run out of the building in fear.And as I stood among the dressed in black, each man and woman walked past me with grieving faces.They told me how much my mother meant to them and how sorry they were.They each shared a happy moment for me to hold onto, to think about the better times.Despite the stories, I sat there.Watching the grave digger shovel more and more dirt onto her coffin.Soon there was no-one left but the gravedigger.I broke down into tears, sobbing into my palms like a little boy.I wailed and wailed thinking about all the moments I had with her, and all the moments I wouldn't.I heaved with each cry and let out what I had tried so strongly to hold in.To give the appearance of strength.But I was weak.I was helpless.I let her die.I should've pushed harder.You see she wasn't dead of old age.She didn't die in a tragic car accident.She died of Methemoglobinemia.Aniline seeping into the water pipes from a nearby factory repeatedly poisoned my mother for years."I'm sorry," a voice said calmly behind me.I was startled and released my sticky hands from my face.The gravedigger was gone, the grave still only half full.I tried to recompose myself before turning around to face the voice.But when I turned I saw her.Ira.The girl I once loved.Once.We had split up right before college in a less-than-friendly fashion.I don't even remember what the fight was about, but she had struck me.It didn't really hurt physically and I tried to assure her that I could forgive it but she was distraught.She said nobody had ever made her feel that way and left.She stood there, looking like she did the day we split up.I sat there motionless, the scent of freshly dug soil lingering in the air.She turned and walked away.And I didn't follow.After a few days, I wasn't even sure it happened.Perhaps it was just a stress-induced imagination?But she stayed in my mind, and with every lucky green traffic light, to fortunate parking space.Every random Samaritan paying for my meal, she came into my mind.Was she the reason I was called "THE Warren"?I was bent over my desk, paper scattered across the surface.Like a full blown conspiracy theorist, I had strings connecting pages and photographs on a cork board, trying to link all the people that held back the regulations to make the water safe.I had most of the links, but it was overwhelming me.There were _so_ many people involved, from government officials to safety inspectors.All of them in on it in some way.In this moment my mother would've come in with a glass of tea, patting me on the shoulder to tell me that I shouldn't work so hard.That I would work myself into an early grave.But her ghost faded away as I yearned for that pat on the shoulder.I looked up in anger and saw the photos of the men and women stuck on the board who denied me the rest of her life.I screamed.I screamed and screamed only to be interrupted by a knock on my door.Looking through the peephole, I saw "Joe's Pizza Palace" written on the teenager's hat."I have a delivery for a Mr.Warren?"the pizza boy yelled from the other side of the door before giving it another knock.I opened the door."Ah Warren right?"he asked, handing me the pizza."I didn't order a pizza?"I mentioned, still taking the pizza in hand because it was a pizza and I wasn't gonna say no."It says right here, Warren, 25 Paper Street, pepperoni and pineapples with extra pineapples," he said, pointing at the receipt, "now I won't judge you for the pineapples, everyone has their dirty little secret.Have a nice day!"the boy said with a smile before turning and walking away."W-Wait, I haven't paid for this yet," I yelled across my front yard."Um," the boy looked back down at the receipt, "No it says here that you paid online already," he yelled back as he reached his car door, the "Joe's Pizza Palace" car topper blocking his face.He paused and leaned to look at me again past the topper."Or at least, somebody did," he mentioned with an innocent smile before getting in the car and driving away.Pepperoni and pineapples were my favorite.I walked back into my living room and placed the pizza down, opening the box expecting a message written inside.Of course there was none.Why would there be?I took a slice and walked up to the cork board of faces.I stood there chewing trying to think of my approach tomorrow.I had planned to go to the zoning official's office and get some answers.I had a rough plan about how I was gonna get in front of the man but it was still rough.Looking back down at the pizza, I tried to shake it off as crazy.But the feeling was there and any idiot could see the connections.But it was _crazy_."Tomorrow," I yelled to nobody in the room, "I am going to the zoning official's board to speak to Harold Weinbrecht about the unattended seeping of Aniline into the water supply system."And of course, nobody replied.---
