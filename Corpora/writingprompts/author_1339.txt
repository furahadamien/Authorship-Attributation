"I can't keep doing this" Matthew stated, hold back the long, dark hair of his ex as she started to vomit into the toilet."It's not what you think.I'm so grateful th-" Amy started to reply.Matthew cut her off."I don't want to hear it, I am tired of this.It used to be once in a while and a minor annoyance, but now it's every other day.I was supposed to wake up to go to work in a couple hours, but instead I'm here helping you because you made another bad decision."Amy started to cry."If that's how you really feel then just leave!"she shouted."You don't have to stay and help me, you can just go."Matthew let go of her hair and walked out of the door.And for the next couple months, he never saw Amy, he assumed after that last conversation she didn't need him anymore.Matthew was finally free to go out and do the things he wanted, without having to be whisked away to help Amy."That must mean she's happy, right?"Matthew's best friend Cole asked."What do I care?She made my life a living hell.""Dude, you used to be happy that you could continue to help her even after it ended.She really needed you some of those times, and you always came through for her.You said as long as she was smiling when you left, that was enough for you to make it all worth it.""What are you getting at here?Of course I would say that in the beginning, I was still in love with her then.""I think you're still in love with her now, that you always have been.Look my in the eyes and tell me I'm wrong."Matthew turned to face Cole.He was about to say that Cole was wrong, but then Cole's words started to sink in."I...I think I forgot what her smile looked like, because I only ever saw her when she was sad or upset.I do miss helping her now that she's gone, but I screwed up the last time, I don't think she's ever going to need me again after that."Matthew looked down at the floor."I think I need her now."Over the next week Matthew grew depressed, he couldn't stop thinking of how terrible he had acted toward Amy the last time he saw her.He wanted to call her a few times, but could never muster the courage to pick up the phone.Walking home one night he kept replaying the last conversation with her in his mind.He was so distracted when he was crossing he street that he didn't hear the horn of the oncoming truck until there was no time to get out of the way.Matthew froze and closed his eyes as he braced for the impact, but it never came.When he opened his eyes back up he saw Amy standing in front of the bathroom door in her house.Tears were falling down her face, but she stood there silently.Matthew had never seen her so distraught, he wanted to ask what was wrong, but he was still in shock that he was alive.She said the first words."I lost it..." She covered her eyes and began to weep.Matthew realized in that moment that Amy wasn't throwing up before because she had been drinking, but because she was pregnant, and her boyfriend must have left when he found out.Upon realizing this, Matthew unfroze and immediately embraced her, tears falling down his face as well."You don't have to be here" Amy said through her sobs."I want to be here" Matthew replied."You saved my life, in more ways that one, every time I left with you smiling.I just never saw it until now.I'm sorry.""You never had to leave after you finished helping me you know.""I won't leave this time, I love you, I need you."Amy opened her eyes and looked into his.She said the only thing Matthew needed to hear."I will always be there for you when you need me.I promise."
