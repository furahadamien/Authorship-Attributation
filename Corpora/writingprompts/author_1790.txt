I remember I could hear the water running in the bathroom .Thoughts racing through my head.Should I turn down the music?Or maybe I should just turn it completely off, maybe music is one of those things that sounds like a good idea, but really its not...I dunno.We'll go with on.What about lights?off, on?The desklamp was on when we walked in ...I'll just leave that on.Gotta be fine, right?So nervous!There comes a time when you start to wonder if it is ever going to "happen" for you.At first you think for sure once you graduate from high school and move on, then it will.But then after a while, you don't really move on, and you're still living in your parent's house, working as a line cook at Gold Star.However, everything changed last fall Daphne moved into my neighborhood.We immediately hit it off.She's a bit of an enigma as well because, well, she's definitely a Thelma, but that didn't bother me at all, I thought she was fantastic.Now she was in my bathroom, doing something with the water, and this was all going to happen."Whew," I thought, "I've definitely been fiddling with that packet long enough.Open it, or just leave it unopened?Is opened presumptuous?Maybe she'd want to open it.You know, inspect it.You never can be too safe these days."The questions you'd like to have asked your... dad, well not me, not my dad.I mean, I loved the guy and he really liked me as well.But we didn't have that kind of relationship.Not like he had with my older brother.Connor was the really handsome, athletic type.Star football player, prom king.I was more into building model space ships.He went into the Marines after High School.God, I loved that guy.He was killed in Afghanistan three years later and it wrecked me.Wrecked my dad as well.The old man just flat walked out on mom, me, and my three older sisters about a month after we found out.Went for that proverbial "pack of cigarettes" and never came back.The guy didn't even smoke...

"Hey there, Space Balls!"It is hard to explain, but it is as if while I was reminiscing him saying these words I also distinctly heard them in my head.I looked up and there he stood, in the doorway of my bedroom, dressed just as he was when he walked out 10 years prior.Wearing the same, but now torn, faded blue jeans and the same, but now tattered, Montgomery Varsity ball-cap.Older and graying, dirty, and hollow."Back from the 7-11!"he continued, "turns out I  didn't want to start smoking any..."

My shear disbelief was pierced by a shriek, or a shrill, or I'm not exactly sure how to describe the sound of abject horror Daphne exuded as she emerged from my bathroom wearing, nothing.She quickly grabbed an Xbox controller from my desk and tried to use it to cover her, you know nether... parts.Great, I thought to myself, if nothing else that should just about do it."You said we were alone!""Dad!?!Wh- What are you?"I exclaimed as I frantically gesticulated between she and him.But then my eyes fixed on Daphne, doe-eyed and staring at me, holding a look of embarrassment, shock, and betrayal before she mustered, "You said your father was dead, asshole."and turned to walk back into the bathroom.My gaze returned to my dad, still frozen in the doorway, almost seeming as shocked as I by the turn of events."Z..., " he began as he turned on the light, "listen she's got to be like 15 years older than you.Is she the babysitt..."  but then he froze, mid sentence, as our eyes locked for the first time and what blood was left vanished from his already ashen face."Con-man?""No dad, its me, Zach!""Bud," he paused as tears welled up in his eyes, "I missed you so..."

"We missed you too Dad, where have you..."

".... we thought you were... your mom and I were told you were dead.They said you were dead..." he continued as he rushed to the side on my bed."But you're alright.You've come back to us,"  and as he cupped his hands around my neck I noticed a worn out plastic band around his wrist."yeah, Dad, yeah" I replied through my tears, "we're all back, now."
