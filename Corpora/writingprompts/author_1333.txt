You stare blearily down into your glass of scotch, wondering when exactly you'd slid from drowning your sorrows into casual alcoholism.It had been three years since Anna died but you still felt certain you'd be called in to help her at any moment.Surely any moment now you'd feel that familiar prickling sensation down your back that warned you Anna was in trouble again.Of course you were well aware that would never happen, since you'd been there when she died.Being teleported next to someone who was skydiving while not having a parachute yourself is an incredibly traumatic experience in and of itself.What made it worse was the realization that your unwanted skydiving partners chute, apparently her backup, had become tangled and failed to deploy properly.You tried to grab hold of her, you really did, but when you're being honest with yourself, you never had a chance really.You aren't sure someone with extensive skydiving experience could have handled the problem and you are no such person, despite the wide array of skills you picked up in your years of adventures with Anna.You suppose you were lucky that near the end she mustered the composure to send you back before impact.You aren't entirely sure how the teleportation worked other than that it wasn't totally voluntary on her part, but you ended up right back in your office chair where you started, not at terminal velocity.When she was alive you resented her.Of course your relationship with her was rather complicated.You'd always cared about her, loved her even, but making an actual romantic relationship work between the two of you had been impossible.You liked books, she liked gun ranges, you preferred to stay at home, she traveled through disreputable backwoods parts of third world countries, your favorite sport was swimming, hers was free climbing.This made things all the more complicated when that stupid childish promise you'd made to her actually came true, and then you broke up.Then you were trapped, being dragged into her constantly troubled life to rescue her from muggings, broken down bikes and cars, injuries out in the wilderness, animal attacks, bar fights, car accidents....of course there was more to it than just trouble she'd gotten herself into, you'd been a shoulder to cry on more than once too, like when her parents died, or when she'd almost died rock climbing.It took her death to make you really understand what you're strange relationship meant to you though.The two of you had never really changed, while she was out exploring the world, you'd gone to school found a desk job, and settled down into a comfortable life.After she died you realized how empty your life had become without her in it.Somewhere along the way you'd become just as much of an adventure junkie as she was, but unable to admit it to yourself, able to hide it from yourself as long as you could get your fix by coming to the rescue like some kind of bargain-bin superhero whenever she got into trouble.Now that all that was over there was no more running from the truth, you had wanted that life.Really you'd wanted to be with her all along, or someone like her you supposed if you hadn't been magically joined at the hip, having adventures.That was why you'd fallen for her, albeit briefly, when you were both fifteen, and why you'd slowly fallen in love with her in truth over those seven years you were stuck together.You staggered upstairs, changing into your pajamas to fall into bed and begin the second phase of your nightly ritual; staring at the ceiling morosely while regretting your life choices.It wouldn't have been so bad if you hadn't been through so much together.If things had just ended like they should have you might have come to this realization on your own, but without feeling like your heart had been ripped out of your chest and squashed in front of you.It's ironic you suppose, since Anna herself would have had no sympathy at all for your pathetic self-pitying attitude.It's not like you were the one who died, you had your whole damn life to stop being such an egocentric dick and actually enjoy yourself.You let your eyes close.You still missed her though, that was ok surely, she'd been closer to you than anyone else in your life, it only made sense that it hurt for her to be gone.You can almost feel the familiar sensation of needles prickling down your spine just thinking about her.Your eyes snap.You *can* feel that familiar sensation of needles because you are feeling it.You slap your hand frantically in the dark for your bedside table and the taser you keep inside its drawer for just this situation, feeling your fingers close around the grip as your bedroom vanishes in a flash of light.Your disorientation on arrival in....wherever the hell you are is compounded by the explosive boom of nearby thunder and you swint as the lightning flash fades from your eyes.In the same moment the feeling of cold rain soaking through your thin pajamas shocks you into gasping and cursing under your breath, the first sound you've made all night.The rain itself is thunderous, pouring down in heavy sheets from a darkened sky as more thunder peels in the distance.You appear to be in some kind of woodland area, near a steep riverbank.Finally you realize that several feet in front of you are two figures struggling on the muddy ground.They're difficulty to make out in the gloomy lighting, especially since both are completely covered head to toe in dark mud.The smaller of the two seems to be at a disadvantage, pinned under the larger figure who appears to be choking the smaller combatant.What in the hell had you gotten yourself into, and where was this.You shake your head to clear it, there's a violent situation unfolding, and by the looks of it, rapidly transitioning into murder.You can't very well stand by and do nothing.You step forward and lunch at the larger figure, slamming your taser into their side and activating it.The hulking person thrashes violently in response, stiffening and slamming back into you, knocking you off your your feet and into the thick mud."Argh, fuck."you curse loudly as you slam into the ground hard.You barely have time to begin picking yourself up before the hulking figure looms above you.The hell?You just tased this guy and he's on his feet faster than you were just from slipping, shouldn't he be down for the count?In that moment, you deeply regretted never having had the opportunity to use the damn thing before since you'd bought it only after the second time someone tried to mug Anna.You try to stand up anyway, but a fist larger than one of your thighs slams into your chest and you fall back to the ground wheezing and coughing.So much for being a hero.Looking up at the mud covered giant you can see the end to your three years of binge drinking and self recrimination.At this point it only seems fitting that you'd be on the verge of getting your life back on track and being true to what you really wanted this time, only to be teleported into a thunderstorm to be beaten to death by an incredible hulk wannabe.As his fist cocks back before coming crashing down in a rib shattering blow lighting strikes again, illuminating the figure behind the the giant, and the glint of metal grasped in its hand.You squeeze your eyes shut as a wet ripping sound precedes hot liquid spattering onto you.Moments later there's a wet thump as the corpse of the giant splashes down into the mud and rainwater.You squint up at the person you so ineptly attempted to rescue, and see that they are holding out a hand to help you up."I thank you kind stranger, I'm surprised you managed to distract that tough bastard enough for me to escape."She says, her voice is gruff, but definitely feminine and....familiar.You stare into her face, blinking rapidly as the rain washes away the dirt and block all too quickly.Really it should have been obvious.The teleportation, the dangerous situation....but you couldn't let yourself believe it, the dead just don't come back to life.Not even in a world with real gods."Anna ...I-- you-- how--" you choke on your words unable to form a coherent sentence.Seeing a dead person alive again would probably have been enough to rob you of speech normally, you aren't the most eloquent person out there to begin with.The combination with almost dying yourself and seeing your-- whatever Anna is to you, kill someone in front of you was more than enough to completely shut down all brain functions.She frowns, "How do you know my name?What the hell are you doing here anyway?"You blink again, and eye her up and down....she looks different.Her clothing, not that you can see much of it under the mud, looks strange, almost like medieval armor.She has several new small scars on her face that you can see, and she seems taller and more muscular.Finally you're prompted to act as the feeling of needles prickles up your back.She doesn't need you here anymore so you're going home whether you like it or not.What the hell do you even say in a situation like this, with so little time to boot."I-- I'm just here to keep a promise."You give her a smile a two fingered wave as your vision is consumed in a sea of light.
