'Think of your kids, John!'And walking past the last poster before he got to Vic's shop, he did.Pair of bastards.He stopped at the door of the tiny store, pausing for a moment to suck one last plume of tobacco smoke from his cigarette.A rather damp and unpleasant plume at that, but at this stage of the game, beggars can't be choosers.He gazes through the familiar glass door of his most often visited store, holding the smoke In his lungs as he watches the ageing proprietor of the establishment standing dreamily behind the counter, sorting through a box of expiring or expired goods, probably for the 5th time this week.He exhales, the tobacco smoke exiting his body causing an acrid taste to coat his lips and the end of his tongue for a moment, and he relishes it.He drops the misshapen butt of his cigarette into a rectangular metal container mounted on the wall, and the cigarette lets out a pleasing hiss as it lands in the small amount of rainwater gathered in the bottom of the ashtray.This could be the last public ashtray in the country now, he thinks to himself briefly before walking into the shop.The door gave a familiar soft squeal against the vinyl floor as he pushes it open.The old man looks up from his box of perished goods at the familiar face of his best customer."Hello John."He says and automatically leans down to pick up a small, grey box from under the counter.It is devoid of any markings other than Victor Douglas written on the top with a marker."Thanks Vic.How many are here?""I think 42 or 43.He sent a note with this box.Haven't got a note from him before."Vic said, not making eye contact, peering at the small carton of cigarettes."Oh, really?"John replied, disinterestedly."How much do I owe you?"Vic consults a tiny piece of paper taped to the till."One hundred and four."He replies.John takes his wallet from his pocket and pulls out five notes, and placed them on the counter, returning his wallet to his jeans and fishing in his coat for some change."John, I think this is it."Vic says in a monotone voice."Hmm?"John responds arranging change into his hand."John, he's finished.He's not growing any more tobacco.He sent a note in with this box, and he says he's done.He doesn't want to grow it anymore.I took me months to find this man after Francis in the next county over died, and that was only by chance.John, the only reason...The only reason I'm still open - still alive - is because you've kept coming in for your smokes.I think I'm done too John."John paused briefly with his change still in his hand, before gently placing it down along with his notes on the counter.He looked into the old and familiar eyes for what seemed like minutes, before lifting his carton of cigarettes."Well then.If this is the last of it."John pulls two cigarettes rolled in what looks like fax paper out of the box and holds them up between himself and Vic."Want to share one last smoke?"
