As the Lord stepped forward to the pair, with eyes of steely blue

Lightning from his fingertips, the Devil felt subdued

He looked upon his creation, Johnny with the magic touch

With a fiddle in his hand, Johnny understands he is invincible as such

But prideful Johnny didn't have a clue
That the good Lord was all-knowing and what He was about to do

"Johnny, my boy" said the Lord, we're all cheated in this ruse

If you think this is a fiddle contest then I must impart bad news

Out there far a yonder there's this internet site called Reddit

The people who go visit there upvote posts with merit

But one mistake they made was to blaspheme upon my name

Hallucinations and silly mushrooms?That dude is in the Hell of Fame.As the Good Lord of Everything, I'll carefully explain

Why this should be the best submission right after this refrain

*Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
As the people read this here they're gonna sing along the part
And if they like what they read they'll shower you with gold
And if they don't, the post is getting ooooold*


So the Lord began the tale of the people out yonder

Yes you people out there reading along, hopefully with wonder

The moral of the story is not who gets reddit gold

It's the spark of creativity, all the tales that've yet been told...
