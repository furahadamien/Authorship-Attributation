Ive always had that voice in my head.Like, it just talks to me, sometimes others talk too.Im always sick of it, it bothers the hell out of me.Well, a few days ago I had an idea.What if I asked the voice to pay rent, because I mean it is my brain.So I asked something like this, Hey!Time to pay rent, your 27 years late!.Ugh, we have names and feelings too, you know!, they had exclaimed simultaneously.Im Schiz, said one voice.Im O. said another, And im ophrenia. said the last voice.Well, pay up!, I thought.They went silent afterwards.I woke up this morning, to find an envelope on my table.I looked inside and it had $15,000.I did the calculations 550 times 25 plus some extra.Note: This is my first writing, and Im doing this on mobile.Please excuse my bad grammar.
