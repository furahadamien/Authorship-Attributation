Its a boring life I tell you.Seeing prisoners come and go.I find myself wondering when exactly is our luck determined?At the moment of conception?At birth?In any case, those that have as much luck as we can get are forced to be here...Watching through the bars I see inmates laze around in their cells.Theyre not allowed to do anything where skill is a factor, because their luck would render the necessary skill redundant.Its a shame too, the stories I hear about some of these guys.One tried to run for office but was discovered to be a Clover when he won the election in a landslide of 51/49% by 1 swing vote.Clovers, what a childish but accurate way to refer to us.But thats what happens when you make it too obvious.Now were stuck here, forced to watch the Black Cats, the 0 Luck people, as theyre dragged into cells.I have to make my rounds soon on the prisoners soon... last week by a stroke of luck I discovered a very unfortunate attempt at an escape tunnel...But thats why Ill always be stuck here... forced to use my luck to keep the unlucky stuck.EDIT: Thanks for 1k upvotes!(My first post to break that!)
