Why brother?Why would you hurt me?Is it because of the jealousy you have?Father always loved me more.I'm cold.I'm so cold.I feel the darkness wrapping around my waist.I feel the fear washing over my face.Sending a tingle down my spine.My face is wet my chest is heavy.What is this?Am I lost?I lay there for an eternity.I can't wait to get my revenge.I'm so fucking COLD!I feel as my flesh wept away.It was not painful.It was suprising as a blanket get torn away from your warm body, facing the harsh, brisk winter night.I claw at my under flesh and pull away my bone to warm myself from this dark cold wasteland of nothingness.My leg bones grow back.Again and again.No matter how many times I disconnect them from my waist.I sit in my dark, cold, wretched borrow my Father has forgotten about, next to my pile of disjointed leg bones and start dreaming of what I would do to my brother that put me in this cave of despair.Carving a sharp tool we used to cut the fields from which we eat from.Every bit of time that passes is a second I feel less and less cold.I feel less time, less desire.My hands, no stripped of their flesh have no feeling.White as the smile I once beloved from my mother.My tool, now fastened to the stick made of my bone has a faint glow to it.It stands awkwardly.I had to carve them to join together like pieces of lumber cut from the All Giving Tree.Little creases to hold them together.As I grab my tool the void of my Grim wraps it self around me like a ploom of smoke.Almost like a child clinging to his mother soes not to be abandoned.With my tool firmly in my desolved lifeless hands, it wears something on my hand.It looks like a symbol.Its warm.No... it's hot!I try and let go, I can't!"Get it off!"I yell to no-one.I swing the tool in an attempt to knock it out of my hands.It grabs the nothingness like a piece of parchment and tears it.The burning stopped and I see a man and a woman.Both elderly, holding each other as they close their eyes at the same time.A light of a reflection of them fall.I watch them start to lose the light.I chase them as I see their bodies lay there.I reach my hand out to see the fear on their faces.They reach back, "please!Help us!"They see my face and scream and retract their hand.The hand I'm reaching for starts glowing.Suddenly we stop.We are elevated with no barring.This is nothing like my Grim.This is the heavens.The night heavens.I look around everywhere.I see an eternity of light dots and its beautiful.The couple seems at ease after they take in the same view I am."Who are you?"The man almost whispers to me in this infinite silence.I'm taken aback.I haven't heard another person's voice for as long as I can remember."I..I don't know.I'm from the Grim.It's an infinity, like this except mine is darkness and much more cold."My voice is harsh and not the one I remember.It echoes, like Father's used to."Well, Mr.Grim, what happens to us now?"The man asks, as if I had the answer."Come with me"
I take their hands and I start moving towards a nothing.Suddenly the nothing becomes brighter and brighter.The man and the women are gone and I am touched by a warmth so deep, it reminds me of the soft touch of my mother when I was a boy.Suddenly, a horn sounds.It starts soft, then gets louder.And louder.And louder.Before long I cant take it.I wave my tool to escape, nothing happens.Then, just as suddenly as the horn started, it stopped."YOU HAVE DONE WELL.THIS IS WHO YOU ARE NOW, GRIM."The voice was so loud, I felt it as if it was a dream.Then I was back.My Grim.No.Please.I can't be toyed with like this.My hand starts to burn again."I will not do this!I will not be what you want me to be!"The pain increases.It doesn't stop.Soon its through my whole body."GET OFF ME!"I swing my hands and the Grim rips in two.I see a child.It isn't crying.It is blue.Why is it blue?The women holding the child is screaming at the lifeless corpse.A light drops from the body.After I catch it, I scream, "Okay.If this is what I have to do to protect them from the Hell you put me in, so be it.I'll do it!""IF YOU FAIL, THEY WILL FACE THE SAME FATE YOU HAVE.THE SOUL MUST BE GUIDED.""Yes Father.I understand now."
