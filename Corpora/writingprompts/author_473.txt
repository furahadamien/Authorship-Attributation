It had been 10 years since Xanthem, Emperor of Zaraxia, had finished his 4,000 year tour across the universe, taking souvenirs from each planet he pillaged in honor of his coronation.Among his spoils, in a stasis crate easily missed in his vast collection of wealth, was a conversation piece Xanthem took almost as an after-thought.The dominant species on Earth had not yet advanced past their own planet, and thus their resources were useless and primitive compared to the Zaraxians.Xanthem, in his wisdom, decided to let the star system develop for a few more millennia, and return when their was something worth taking.At the insistence of his court however, having come all this way, he chose the nearest human he could find as a souvenir, and promptly left the desolate star system.10 years later, this off-hand decision came back to haunt Xanthem.First, Estria, the Zaraxian's outermost colony went silent.The last messages received detailed the sightings of Carthinian-like ships, the style of a race wiped out by Xanthem's great-grandfather eons ago.Then the same descriptions were received in the last communications from the warships sent to investigate, before they too went silent.Another planet went dark, and another scouting expedition failed to return, until Xanthem himself led the largest fleet assembled to Exon, the next planet predicted to fall silent.For the first time in a hundred thousand years, the Zaraxians feared that there existed a force greater than their own, that the Carthinians had somehow survived, and thrived after the Zaraxian's destruction of their sun had wiped out the Carthinian's capital star system.Xanthem for the first time in his long life, felt fear.The unprecedented golden age of his civilization had been raging for the last 80,000 years, Zaraxia had won control of the known universe, but maintaining a grand army was too expensive.Xanthem's father was the king who drew down the military, seeing no formidable opponents left.Xanthem himself was an explorer, convinced that there were still civilizations out there in the stars undiscovered or underdeveloped, and that was the whole reason he spent so much on his 4,000 year journey in the first place.Yet now, with eons-long peace, he feared that his empire and dynasty would be blown out like a candle light.The first transmissions came through on an old Carthinian terminal brought out from the archives, but something was off about them.The grammar was incorrect, as though the sender had only recently learned the language.They read "We come in peace, but war if needed.In search of human Matt Damon".Admiral Zhen, of the First Terran Intergalactic Fleet, didn't expect he'd be chosen for the mission.After all, it was alien tech discovered and recreated by the US government, which made up his fleet.Yet in a show of good faith due to escalating trade tensions, the American President nominated a Chinese general to command the first UN fleet of intergalactic warships.Zhen almost felt humiliated when he first received word of his nomination.He had joined the army and quickly moved up the ranks due to his father's connections within the Party, ultimately rising by his own right due to his handling of the Pakistani dispute.Yet now, just months after a supposed alien ship appeared and snatched Matt Damon of all people (an actor who Zhen often confused for Mark Walhberg), he was to lead a hypothetical fleet on a rescue and contact mission?He thought his career would end in a wild goose chase, he didn't believe in aliens, and thought footage from the Damon incident was a hoax.That was, until he saw first-hand the tech the Americans had amassed.Over the next 5 years, the world joined in to help build the expensive fleet, it was political suicide at first for many politicians as their constituents went hungry while several trillion dollars were routed to a fleet that most doubted would even fly.On the day of the launch, 14 ships, with 30,000 crew members aboard each vessel, embarked on a mission no one could have imagined.The President had convinced the world at the UN with his speech, that this mission was not just a rescue mission, but one that would determine the fate of the human race.If there was a civilization out there, capable of visiting our planet and kidnapping one of us, they'd also be capable of enslaving, or murdering us all.3 years into the mission, Zhen's fleet reached the Origin Point, the point from which the crashed alien ship the Americans found decades ago was believed to have originated.But there was nothing there but a dense asteroid field.Expeditions among the rubble found fragments of the same tech from the ship, and within the year Zhen had amassed as much knowledge of the Carthinians as possible.The most recent info had the Carthinians at war with the Zaraxians, but nothing suggested that they had won.The crew onboard the fleet used the new tech found and modified it with their own advancements, boosting speed to numbers once believed impossible.At the year mark, the UN demanded more, and so Zhen ordered his ships to resume their expedition.Rexen, the nearest planet from maps pieced together, was only months away now with the fleet improvements.Upon arrival, Zhen was dismayed to find a once thriving civilization dwindled down to a mere thousand inhabitants.Rexen had been neutral during the wars, but was subjugated by Zaraxia soon after their victory.Their planet was stripped of their resources, and those who didn't die working were the few left once the Zaraxians abandoned the planet.Without resources and a stable climate, Rexen would not rise again.It took linguists months to communicate with them, but their info proved to be invaluable.Every once and awhile, Zaraxia would send ships to ensure that their domain was without sedition, and so even lonely Rexen would recieve a visit.The visiting Zaraxians would give them goods, news, and entertainment, more because they pitied them than anything else.Thus the remaining inhabitants of Rexen were more than thrilled to assist their new visitors.When Zhen reached Estria, he sent out a message, and instead was met with a blast that destroyed an entire ship, the Excelsior.Seeing no other option, he ordered nukes launched, and the scout ships which arrived en route to the next planet were met with extreme prejudice.When Zhen's fleet reached the next planet, the nukes were preemptively used as EMPs.Battalions went down and recovered as much intel as they could among the masses of Zaraxians clamoring for basic services.If this was Earth, Zhen and his crew would have been tried for war crimes, but losing another ship was not an option.The scout ship after was quickly dispatched with newly acquired Zaraxian tech, and the location of Matt Damon among Xanthem's spoils was found.Zhen knew silencing two planets and two scout expeditions would raise alarms at the highest levels of the Zaraxian government, and so he planned for all-out war when they would reach Exon.It was now or never, Earth had exhausted it's resources to build these ships, and would not be able to defend itself should the fleet perish.Zhen sent an expedition in advance to retrieve Damon, knowing that all forces would converge upon Exon rather than guard a spoiled Emporer's riches.Once Damon was secured, the party would wreak havoc on Zaraxia.Xanthem gazed at the small ships, appearing to be escape pods, through his telescope.A diplomatic party perhaps?The "Carthinian" pods communicated as such.He ordered his forces to stand down, not realizing that the escape pods, manned by survivors of the Excelsior, were suicide bombers.In a flash they broke formation and detonated, the Zaraxian armada was wiped out in an instant.On Earth, a year later, Matt Damon was successfully reawakened from stasis, having no memory of the last 11 years, unaware of the sacrifice Earth made to find him.
