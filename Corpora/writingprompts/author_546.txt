Daniel was relaxing after a rough day of work at the office, watching his favorite sports team, when the front door swings open rather quickly and slammed shortly after.His daughter is sobbing hysterically and runs to her room which he can hear is slammed just as loud.Some sobbing can be heard from down the hall.He turns off the tv.Takes a deep breath to compose himself.And starts down the hall.He knocks on Katherine's door and starts, "Hey Kath, do you want to talk abou-",

"I WANT TO BE ALONE FOREVER!"she screams at him as more muffled sobs can be heard from inside her room.He opens the door anyway, slowly, just a bit.She is lying on her bed, crying softly into her pillow.She was still wearing her heels and her hair was curled all nice like, and she was wearing her new floral dress."Boy troubles."He says under his breath with a sigh.He sits down next to her on the bed and puts a reassuring hand on her back and says, "Hey Kath, what happened tonight?""He-, he was making out with Tammy" she says softly.And starts another round of crying.He attempts to calm her by giving her a small back rub and says, "Tammy isn't even that cute, I can't believe his taste in women"."Dad you aren't helping!"She cries."Yeah, I know, I know" she seemed to settle down a little."Come here, let me cheer up my little Kat", and he pulls her into a hug so she can cry on his shoulder."When I was about 10, I had this awesome Pokmon card, it was a Typhlosion if I remember correctly, and I had treasured it, it was foil, fire type, super high attack, great heal-"

"Dad."She smiled a bit."Sorry, ok, ok." And he was smiling a bit too, remembering its shine."It was beautiful, I didn't trade it for anything, not even for the Ancient Mew.Anyway, I put it somewhere safe.Apparently, I had put it somewhere too safe because when I went back to look at its glory again, it was gone, so suddenly it seemed.I had always thought it was there, with me, but I could never find it again.It was pretty sad, losing something like that.For a 10 year old anyway.""This is a dumb story", she was getting bored of his 10 year old life struggles."Tough crowd", he laughed."Well, long story short, I had struggled for the next day, thinking about that card.But the very next day, my best friend had traded a shiny new Charizard card for my dumb little Pikachu.He thought Pikachu was the best Pokmon.I never said he was smart."He laughed, and she was just a little confused."Moral of the story, I thought it was the end of the world when I lost my favorite card, but just around the corner was a very different card, yet just as valuable, maybe even more valuable than the card before it."He smiled, and says, "I uh, I hope that helps a little bit, remember that you are beautiful, both the inside and out.""And that your Charizard might be closer than you think".She smiles and hugs him, "Thanks Dad, that was a little weird, but I know what you meant.""Thanks".And with that, he gives her a warm smile, and goes back to his sports game.His favorite team had lost again, but that's ok, he knows his daughter is feeling better.He takes a nice sip of his hot chocolate from his favorite #1 Dad mug that his daughter got him for Father's Day and relaxes with a smile, looking at a picture of his wife, the one that is in his head whenever her thinks of her nowadays.Ever since she passed, he didn't think he could raise his daughter on his own but, today was definitely a victory for him, and he hopes she is thinking the same up from above.
