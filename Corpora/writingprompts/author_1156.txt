> It dawned on you just as you were about to turn the last page.Your eyes instinctively darted to the librarian, who was currently sobbing in a corner of the room.Eons had passed since I had first arrived here, in this comfy-but-completely-isolated conference room.I remember first meeting Emily, the affable librarian who looked like the baby-sitter I had when I entered puberty, reading one of two hard covered books while sipping tea in one of the office chairs.The book she wasn't reading was lying on a table, and everything about it was drawing my interest, some kind of *greed* I had rarely felt while alive.I remember my first thought when passing in this room, despite not knowing where I was or what was going on : I would not leave without that book.> *"The book, and this room, is unique to every person that comes to me"*, you remember the librarian saying in what you now consider the"tutorial voice" she used on countless many before you, but as far as you were concerned, this was just like finding loopholes in a contract : one of the many sources of your riches in many of your later lives.Emily quirkly presented herself and gave me a quick explanation of what had happened : 

1.I had... _"contracted the dead"_ as she liked to teasingly call it.Aaaand...I had one final task to accomplish before moving on permanently.2.The book she was reading when I arrived was *her* book, as in a book where *only she* could relive any part of the life she had before dying.She apparently "volunteered" to oversee people like me for a while.3.I was going to be given my own book, with similar effects as hers, and whenever I felt ready, I could hand it back to her and I'd be on my way.That last rule defined the first few millenniums that followed my first interactions with her.After a few hours of friendly back and forth with the librarian, I understood how exactly the book would work, and what reading it would entail.> Despite your concealed frustration that you couldn't change this corporate environment you would forever be stuck in while reading, and fantasizing about peaceful times on Earth where you would read novels while at sea, in reality you could hardly conceal your own tears when she gingerly handed you the book.When my hands made contact with the delicate leather, my heart stopped beating, and I felt like I was just about to have my second heart attack.That book on the table was mine, and **how I loved it**.I eventually named the book Vella, after a novel series I had been reading before my untimely demise.It was coincidentally accurate, considering the way this strange item eventually found a way to communicate with me in intimate ways I never could have fathomed.Emily explained how it would work it in a way that would make a child understand : 


Your current imagination and creativity was the limit, but it could be updated depending on your own knowledge.Emily explained this use was in case her client was a child, so their experience through the book wouldn't be too much during the first read.I initially thought of a diary alike Tom Riddle's in the Harry Potter series which I had read as a kid, but eventually came up with a more complex way of interacting with my now most precious belonging.At first, I read the book using the little insight I had at the time, not recognizing a good decision from a bad one, but I eventually lead many different lives : Doctor, Pilot, Lawyer, but one of my favorites was one where I eventually became a notorious cult leader.The thought of giving Vella away never crossed my mind.> At this point, you remember deciding to start over from your birth, progressing year by year, having your diary take notes along the way of potentials points of progress you might want to return to.I eventually learned how to use Vella as efficiently as I could despite her obvious flaws.A simple line in a book paled to the descriptions I read when my virtual decisions lead me to trying Virtual Reality or LSD, neither of which I tried while on Earth.I ~~wanted~~ deserved more.But Emily repeatedly explained there would be no more foods, beverages, guests, and definitely no drugs during my "visit".She was growing disgruntled, clearly having expected me to have left by now.It had been perhaps 9 years?The trouble first started a hundred or so years later, when I had reached a point where merely holding Vella was enough for me to fire the necessary brain neurons to have me vicariously live hundreds of different lifetimes in a fast forwarding pace.Emily tried to pry the book from my hands after I had held it in a coma-like state for a consecutive 33 years - the limit we had agreed on for this experiment of mine.She had grown far more strict in this relatively short amount of time.She no longer looked like my cool arithmetic teacher from 9th grade, but more like a dead-beat mom of newborn twins.> It wasn't until 245 years later before you started beating her, suffocated by the lack of stimulus, and your desperate attempt to have her teach you more.It gnarled at me that despite being able to know everything I could from pretty much anyone I could have met during my time on Earth, there was nothing I could learn from Emily.She **strictly** refused to talk about who exactly she was volunteering for, despite her begging when I used psychological torture on her for years on end, courtesy of all the new and fascinating knowledge I could get my hands on when my googolplex of different choices ended up in meetings with every single influential individual of my lifetime.This lifetime had an end, however, so the knowledge I could gather was limited.Since I couldn't be born sooner, I could only prolong my life as much as possible during my _stays_ with Vella.My (so far) inevitable death record stood at a (so far) record of 102 years which is not bad for a dude born pre-2k, but what infuriated me most was realizing that in the years following my latest possible death, genetics had advanced to a point where designer-babies who would live comfortably for over 200 years were becoming the norm, and in the multiple attempts I had in the book to figure out immortality, none had come relatively close.Despite my absolute control over the fictional world Vella was offering me, I couldn't leave this conference room I knew every corner of, but nothing about.Emily hated that I was using my diary this way, comparing it to the holiest of artifacts I would ever hold which was being soiling by my nefarious use.I considered it envy over my expertise of my precious tool.The librarian's state of mind started deteriorating after what I hope was over a million year, between begging for me to move on, and complete silence and isolation, especially after threatening her into giving me access to her own book, unyieldingly closed when I tried opening it.> By the time you realized that you had basically spent eternity learning all there is to know, you never quite came to the conclusion that eternity wouldn't be waiting for you.My hallucinations are starting to become more vivid._"How long have I -"_

You decide to take a break in the other corner of the room.
