"You can't just assume everything will work out.Because it won't."she would say.It was her way of telling him to get off his ass.Vince would take extra time, knowing he'd never hear the end of it if he didn't do what she was asking him to do.But things just always did work out for him.He didn't want to rub it in her face, but it was true.He could be five minutes late for the bus, and still catch it.He could hop on the train with no money and never get ticketed.He could he in a house fire and be the only one alive.He could choose a stock to invest in, and it would be the right one.That is exactly how things always seemed to work for him.Sure there would be setbacks, but it would always pan out.She was just wrong.But, god, he loved her anyway.He admired her tenacity.She always planned things out, planned for the worst possible scenario.Planned, so she could avoid setbacks."Her rating was 50."Vince said, not realizing his voice was audible."Who's?"came the voice from the bottom bunk."What?"Vince was jolted out of his thoughts."I see why it didn't work out."The voice responded.Vince let out a hiss-laugh."It would've if I wasn't such a dumb-ass."Vince didn't care at this point.She could've fooled anyone.She was a genius.She learned early how to avoid all the unlucky shit.God, he missed her."I suppose so."Vince could barely try, and things would just go his way... which is why he was here... why most people like him ended up here.He got too cocky.He saw an opportunity to make some cash, and went for it.And until now, he had avoided getting caught.He was a lucky bastard.But luck wasn't foolproof.Just because these guys all had a luck rating of 100, didn't mean they were immune to consequences...In here, luck didn't matter.Everyone was "lucky," so no one was.Vince let out a sigh as he turned in his lumpy, prison-issued cot.She was a beautiful woman.If only he'd been good to her, maybe she wouldn't have turned him in...
