*It'll be okay,* John thought to himself as he looked over his meeting slides one more time.Glancing up at the clock told him he still had about five minutes left.Today was the "big day", the day he presented the results of his six month project to his company's Executive Board for review.His work, his funding and quite possibly his future at this job rested on this meeting and he hadn't slept in three days between preparation, nervousness and, well... the other thing.Just thinking about it drained the color from his cheeks.He quickly glanced around to ensure he knew where he was.After all, with the blink of an eye, he could-

*Ugh, I really have to go.* He had been holding it in for the past couple of minutes, hoping he could wait until after the meeting.But now...Nature was calling.Insistently.There was a bathroom just off to his right, so he placed his documents on his seat, motioned so that his partner Michael knew here he was going and strolled over.As he stepped through the threshold, though, he gaped in horror.He wasn't in a bathroom.He was in an emergency room.It had happened again.*No... no, no, NO!* he thought, his thoughts racing as he whipped his head left and right.He was in the waiting area, having just walked out of the bathroom door on this side.There were sick people coughing, sneezing, napping or just resting in chairs on the far end of the room and just before him was a desk and two nurses in seats behind it.He rushed forward, both of them focusing on him from whatever conversation he had clearly interrupted."Yeah, hi," he started, already wondering how he could get back.He knew how it worked.He was here to do something and he needed to do it and with his meeting looming, he needed to do it fast."I'm looking for a Rachel Thompson?She told me she'd be here, is everything okay?Is she okay?"The nurse to his left turned to his computer and started typing.The one on his right turned away as well, but to pick up a phone and started talking in medical jargon that John didn't bother trying to translate.After a moment, the computer-nurse looked up."Ms. Thompson is in room 118 and it looks like she's doing okay," he said, his Texan accent reminding John how far he had traveled from Connecticut with this jump."However, the Doctor's notes state her boyfriend is the one that brought her in.Can I ask who you are, sir?"There was something about how the nurse spoke that made John nervous.Not for himself, he knew there was nothing anyone could blame him for.Hell, he hadn't been in the same state as Rachel five minutes ago."I'm her-" *cursed ex-boyfriend from 7 years ago that's trying to move on with his life but can't because some random Goddess that I thought was just a myth makes me pop out of bathroom doors every time she has a problem?Good cover, John.* "-friend.We went to high school together.Look, you said her boyfriend is with her?Do you mind if I just check on them?You can even escort me back there if you have to, I just want to make sure she's okay."*And get the hell out of here.My meeting probably started already!*

The nurse glanced at his co-worker, who was still on the phone.Shrugging, he got to his feet and leaned over the desk, pointing off to John's right at a pair of double doors."If you go through those two doors, all the way down the hall and make a left, it'll be the fourth room on your right.There's another desk at the end of the hall if you can't find it.Someone should be manning it and you can ask there.Try to be quick, though, okay?I'll buzz you in."John nodded his thanks and turned for the door.As he approached, he barely heard the buzzing of the lock coming undone and he pushed through the doors.The other side was your standard hospital hallway.Linoleum floors and doors every few feet where you could see inside and either see empty rooms or curtains drawn for privacy.Stretchers and wheelchairs and medical rolling trays lined the walls between the doorways and the entire place smelled very "clean".There was a buzz of noise in the area, from beeping medical devices to the talking and footsteps of people rushing back and forth, trying to keep ahead of the workflow.John reached the end of the hallway and turned.He could see from here that the fourth door was the only one with the light on and kept walking.As he got close, though, he could hear voices."-bet the police are coming, AGAIN," said a man's voice with a tone of irritation and a similar Texan accent to the nurse."Jees, Rachel, I can't believe you did this again.I swear, I don't know why I put up with this nonsense."John stopped in his tracks.That had to be Andy, the boyfriend.The last two times he had jumped states, Andy had given John a bad vibe.He seemed nice enough and smiled when he spoke, but there was something about how close he stood to Rachel... Something about Andy didn't feel right to John."I-I'm sorry, Andy," she stuttered."I promise, honey, this is the last time.Don't be mad, okay?"A sudden jingling of small metallic items, probably doctor's tools being pushed around a tray made John jump."Don't tell me not to be mad, Rachel!"Andy snapped."I shouldn't have to put up with-"

John took the last few steps to the door and knocked solidly on the frame, leaning around it to peer in.He forced a smile to his lips and tried his best to look innocent."Hey, guys," he said, attracting the attention from both Andy and Rachel.Andy was in his usual jeans and a button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled up.The tattoos on his arms were clearly visible, but what caught his attention was Rachel's face.She was sitting on the hospital bed with a medical gown on.Her hair had changed colors from John's last jump and was now brown with some light highlights in it, like how she had colored her hair when they were first dating back in high school.It would have made her look pretty if not for the swelling black eye and scrapes along her face and neck."Jees, Rachel, what happened to you?"John couldn't ignore that Rachel's eyes flashed to Andy before replying."I, uh, I fell," she said, shrugging as she spoke."You know me, John, super clumsy."John knew.He knew exactly what had happened, just from that lie.Rachel had never been clumsy in her life.During high school, she had been a dancer and walked more gracefully than anyone he had ever known.His eyes shifted to Andy, who he realized was staring a hole through him.He felt his right hand ball into a fist and saw Andy's eyes catch the motion."What are you even doing here, John?How did you know we were here?"he asked, slowly turning his body to face John.Through gritting teeth, John responded."Hospital called me.Rachel must have forgotten to change her emergency contact.Hey Andy, want to grab a coffee with me real fast?"Andy's eyes narrowed even more, but he gave a quick nod in response.Glancing at Rachel, he squeezed her shoulder as he stepped away and John couldn't help but noticed her flinch.*This piece of-,* John started, but couldn't finish his thought from the pounding in his temples.He felt his blood rushing faster and faster, his temperature rising.As Andy got close, John moved in a flash to grab him by the shirt and twisted, dragging the man around with him and shoving him out the door.Andy stumbled into the hallway and landed with his back against the opposite wall.Instantly, John was pushing his forearm against Andy's throat, cutting off his air supply.He leaned his face close and spoke through a clenched jaw."Listen to me, dirtbag, if you ever, and I mean *ever* come near Rachel again, I swear to God, I will know, I will be there and I will personally end you.*Do you understand me?*" Andy's eyes shot left and right.People had heard the noise of the two men and were coming out of rooms and around the desk from the corner John had passed to get to Rachel's room.Behind him, John could hear Rachel sobbing softly and the sound only made it harder to keep himself from putting Andy's teeth down his own throat with some assistance from his fist.Realizing that no one was coming to his aid, Andy looked back at John, his eyes wide.He nodded his head, wheezing for breath and John released him from the wall.Turning his back on the man, he walked into Rachel's room, softly closing the door.She looked up at him, tears streaming from her eyes."I am so sorry, John," she started.He walked over to the bed and sat on the edge, slipping his hand into hers.He felt the cuts and bruises on her fingers.She had tried to defend herself."I swear, I never wanted to pull you away.I tried so hard to keep calm, I thought that if I didn't freak out, you wouldn't come and-"

"Shhh, it's okay Rachel," John said quietly.He was reminded how beautiful her eyes were.The sky blue color had always been his favorite part of looking at Rachel."I'm glad I came.Really, I would have wanted to be here if I didn't jump."Rachel let out a sob and leaned forward, her head against John's chest.His free hand gently stroked her hair as he continued to quietly hush her.After a few seconds, he felt his phone vibrating in his pocket and pulled it out without moving her.It was from Michael, his partner back in Connecticut.*Are you okay in the bathroom?I had to do the presentation without you, we got the funding for next year!First round's on you, man!Meet me back downstairs, okay?*

John smiled.He had wanted to be the one to represent his work after all this time, but he realized he had been at the right place at the right time.A soft chuckle made Rachel look up at him and then, realizing he had his phone out, she frowned."Is everything okay?Did this keep you from something important?"she asked.Again, John looked her in the eye as he responded."Don't worry, Rachel.I'm exactly where I needed to be.Everything is going to be fine, just like I promised you.I'm right here for you."
