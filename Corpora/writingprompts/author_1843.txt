It was all a bit ludicrous, actually...the g-men in their black suits with automatic weapons, the excessive security.The deep elevator that went down level after level to a giant vault door to where they kept us.Nuclear waste wasn't buried as deep as we were.We were the "lucky one-hundreds".The ones with unbelievable luck.The ones with too much luck, apparently.Grabbed by men in vans and hoods thrown over our heads and whisked away to this "undisclosed location".I was here because I was too lucky.I've won the equivalent of 25 people's college tuition from half court shots.I'd won the lottery 7 times, the Masters three years running (because there were the only times I'd competed) and so much more.Today was visitation day.Somebody, perhaps some high powered politician hoping we'd be of help to him if we ever got out of here, had arranged a visit by the Brazilian Bikini Team.There were 45 of them.(I guess they had alternates, too?)Just after they got into the complex, the lights flickered.The visit went well enough, they just sort of danced around a bit.When the time came for them to leave, the radio calls to the surface went unanswered.We came to find out that everyone outside had lost their damn minds and every leader who had them launched every flipping nuclear missile they had.The whole world outside was uninhabitable, at least for the next 20 years.Being as remote as e we were, we could cut it down to 15.We also came to find out, this was the US Congressional safe bunker, because, where else would you want to be when the crap hits the fan than with people like me?Well, it seems that luck only applies when you are where we are, so not a single official made it.It was stocked with everything we'd need for 75 years for 1000 people.We had about 53 souls in all.There were no signals from anywhere else in the world.Here we were, stuck in a bunker... with the Brazillian Bikini Team, having to restart the world's population.Lucky us...
