Vercalos
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My day had started off normal enough.I wasn't planning on going out today, so I just lounged around in my bath robe.I didn't want to spend all day in bed, however.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hoisted myself out of bed then shambled into the kitchen.I opened the cupboard, stared at the empty shelf for a moment, then shuffled over to the sink.I grabbed the least dirty bowl in the sink and rinsed it thoroughly, splashing a bit of dish-soap on it, then wiping it with a paper towel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll spare you the rest of the boring details of my morning routine.Suffice to say, my day started off normally enough,  I was about to take a sip of coffee when I found myself sitting in a church pew, along side many people wearing tuxedos and fancy dresses, and I could only think one thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Aww hell, not again,*    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ex of ten years past stood in front of the pulpit, in front of some guy in a tuxedo, with a priest clearly officiating over the cermony between them.I knew I was here because she needed me, but what the hell did she need me to do?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should anyone here present know of any reason that this couple should not be joined in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Oh.Shit.*
