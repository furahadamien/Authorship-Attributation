It was all over in an instant.Anti-climactic, really.He had spent so much time with the media, talking about my flaws, his strengths... analyzing me from every angle.The late night talk shows were the worst.He would grant interviews about his epic battles with this bad guy or that one, share his emotional origin story, and the audience would hang on every word, relishing his confidence, fawning over his chiseled jaw.Nauseating.Mr.Wonderful had dispatched many a villain in his time.Evil doers great and small fell to his overwhelming strength.Murderers, thieves, investment bankers... any who refused to conform to societal norms met their demise, but not before the media arrived to hear his victory speech.You see, Mr.Wonderful had learned how to wield the power of mass opinion as a weapon more potent than any sword or energy beam.No one was safe from the prying eyes of the masses.From the 30s to about 2045 he even hosted a wildly popular television series, in which family members of petty criminals would betray their erring loved ones to him, and we would all get to watch as he humiliated and executed them.Despicable.Such a sterling public image.A shining example of justice for all to follow.A model citizen, and the kind of guy you bring home to your mom.He was above reproach.Beyond criticism.The kind of guy the world turns to when evil is knocking on its door.But Ive seen his browser history.With the help of a tiny virus planted on his favorite porn site, Ive come to know every, minute detail of this golden mans existence.I learned about how he discovered his powers, watched him develop from a well-meaning farm boy to a global phenomenon and social media superstar.Watched him develop a penchant for power and domination.Seen him rape helpless women in his basement.So as I stood over his limp, bloodied body, listening to him struggle to beg for his life through trembling lips, the irony of it all dawned on me.A man who lived for the cameras would meet his doom in his own bedroom, with no audience but the stars shining through his windows.I wanted to confront him, to denounce his sins and listen to his explanations, but as I watched the light fade from his beautiful eyes, I realized that argument was futile.He would never admit to his crimes.Perhaps he truly believed that he had done nothing wrong.With his last gasp, he managed to gurgle something about needing to update his followers, but his words were cut off as I inserted my knife into his occipital lobe.I knew that in about a week, the world would be fawning over a new hero, and no one would remember his name.Pitiful.
