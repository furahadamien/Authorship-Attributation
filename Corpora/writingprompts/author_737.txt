Sweet-Lady-H
They say a dog
Is mans best friend
That will be by your side
To the very end

So I wanted to tell you
You were my whole life
You loved me and cared for me
Between us never a strife 

You pet me and fed me
And took me on walks
You shared all your secrets
We had so many long talks

And though I couldnt tell you
All that my heart felt
I hope that you know
The best life ever was the one I was dealt

You may not know where I came from
What my story was before you
But none of it matters because 
My life began when one turned into two

Im sorry I had to leave you
But I promise Im still here
In your heart and your memories
So dont shed even one more tear

Thank you for giving me
All the happiness and joy 
So I promise that where I go next
Ill be the bestest good boy.
