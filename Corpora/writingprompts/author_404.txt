My boss was the one person I had made knowledgeable of my ability, I mean it looks good on a resume, especially when you're trying to get into the mafia.He had placed me in a starting position as a bouncer, for a night club he ran, that was of course, also a hot spot for some of the most lavish drug deals in Las Vegas.As the night began, the usuals started to show up, well-dressed people that had enough money to evade their families for drug binging nights once in a while, or those with their continual habits they managed to keep secret, stopping by for their weekly or monthly stock.As midnight hit there was an influx of young kids just past 21, some not even.Those guys were the fun ones, kids with tediously made fake IDs that had never been caught using them, like a deer in headlights, or sometimes throwing a fit like an angry toddler.Made the night more interesting.As the party reached it's peak, my favorite family showed up.The Vasiliev's, a kind family of Russian billionaires, with more money than our organization could ever hope to see.I waved at them as they approached from their car, holding the door to the club wide open."Hey, hold on a minute," I heard the other bouncer whom I was working with mutter, "can I see your ID?"He asked louder as he put his hand out to the young girl that was hanging on the shoulder of Valentin, the Vasiliev's only son.I had not noticed her before.As she detached from Valentin's arm to face my fellow bouncer and hand him her ID, I was able to clearly see her number.My jaw visibly dropped as I realized what I was seeing *-5138*.The girl looked over her shoulder and straight into my eyes for a moment, as if she too had realized what I just saw.Her violet eyes seemed to penetrate my skin.Just as quickly as the moment had happened, she had snatched her ID back with a short, "thank you," and was off into the club with the Vasiliev's."Are you okay man?"My partner asked."You look like you've seen a ghost."Disclaimer: First ever comment to this Reddit page aaayyy, sorry if it's odd, not much of a writer, but I'll finish it later, thanks for the awesome writing prompt!
