A white coffee cup sits on a brown table bathed in sunlight.Coffee staining the bottom in creamy swirls.On the outside are the worlds father number punctuated with a colon and followed by a the numeral 4 with six zeros.A man, stubble-chinned, groggy, barely robed, and three-quarters depressed stairs at his mug, as coffee percolates.The smell permeates the otherwise stale apartment.Coffee generously covers the odors of half eaten pizza, dirty laundry strewn about (though the word laundry implies intent to wash the filthy rags) and by far the most offensive smell, my dad sitting there waiting to fill his white mug with black coffee.He sits unmoving, while I search for something bearable to wear to school.The process involves sniffing several odorous garments.He sits as I brush (with the only toothbrush in the house).He sits as I pick up the mess all around him.He sits as I cook 2 eggs.He sits as I pour the coffee.I hand him the coffee.He takes it.He sips.It doesnt matter, I say with all the persuasion I can muster (it does matter).He stares.I dont care what number that thing says, neither did she.
 
Most census agree there are somewhere between 80 million fathers out there that puts you right in the middle...that means youre not half bad right?I hoped for a chuckle or a smile, but my only reward was the stare.I have to go now.Will you be ok?  I ask perfunctorily.I hug his shoulders.He sits.I grab my backpack and phone and head for the door.The apartment is quiet as my footsteps fade in the distance down the stairs of our shitty apartment.He finishes his coffee.He sets the white coffee cup on the brown table.It now read Father number:  39,999,999.He sits.He stares.I love my dad.
