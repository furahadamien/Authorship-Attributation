Sentarius101
The first time he met her, she was 61.Young, relatively, and dumb.She didn't know any better.A woman with a girl still inside her, a troubled past and a bleak future.The truth she faced was one all do."Who will remember me after I'm gone?"The answer came in the shape of sacrifice.The blood-dimmed King of night and dusk, shadow-playing and everpresent.She, a young foolish mortal, would make a perfect toy.A mother, a lover, and a child.Blood after blood, the sacrifices completed.Ground sullied with life and death.An archaic rune scrawled on old broken ground.A flash, a breath, a deal.But what she gave was not enough.Desperate, hopeless, foolish.An eternity given willingly, and an eternity taken willingly._______________________________

The second time he met her, she was young, still.A mere century had passed.This time, he came for her.A flash, a breath, a deal.The memory still fresh.She had fame, fortune, power.Memory of her would be everpresent.But the deal was broken.Shattered, thrown, lost.Time was coming for her, but not death.He saw, and smiled, and understood.She, uncertain, fearful, hopeful, did not.He laughed, and retreated._______________________________
The third time he met her, time had stopped.An eternity given, and an eternity spent.This time, he approached her.A foe, a friend, a fellow.The deal, fulfilled.An eternity in hell, but an eternity in life.A curse on her, put by all.Hate, fear, regret.Pain sowed in the fabric of reality.The deal, fulfilled.He watched, and waited, and left.Edit: This is my first time answering a prompt, critiques and feedback welcome!
