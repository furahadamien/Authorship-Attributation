Illdietrying
"Oh god," is all I can think to myself as I reread the message in front of me.I glance around at the people around me, all of them shuffling around.The sound of canes tapping the concrete ring in my ears as my pulse quickens."What am I going to do..." I mumble under my breath before joining the crowd of people.The hustle and bustle of everyday life when you're blind has become the norm.I got used to the routine of feeling my way to different locations by relying on my other senses.The shock of waking up and still being in the dark subsided after the first month.But...now that my sight has returned....

A loud crash is heard over the scraping of canes.I instinctively look up towards the sound and before I can stop myself, I'm staring in the direction the noise came from.A toppled trash can rolls from side to side as people bump past it.A boy stands against the wall where the trash once was makes direct eye contact with me.I gasp and look down and away.I try to keep close to the street, avoiding eye contact with the boy at all costs.My efforts are useless, however.The boy intercepts me and grabs my wrist, pulling me down an alleyway.I struggle against his grip, but his hold tightens the more I fight.We stop at the end of the alley and he releases my wrist."Why did you-"  I begin to say when he shushes me.I frown and lower my voice to a whisper as he looks at the street."Why did you drag me here?Who are you?"I ask.He turns toward me and looks into my eyes.His eyes were piercing, searching mine.He lets out a breath."I wanted to see if anyone else regained their sight.Only the people who can't see would look up so quickly to the sound of commotion," He looks over my shoulder at the street."We can't stay here.Follow me and try to not call attention to yourself.They have eyes everywhere."He whispers."We'll talk more when we are safe."
