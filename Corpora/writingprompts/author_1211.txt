Jaytime
I smile, feeling loved and cared for.But feeling I dont deserve it, send a link to this page to all my friends and those I care about and more.Because, and knowing its cliche and corny, I feel that sharing this feeling is truly what this holiday is for.In the words of a great writer and christmas classic: 
 "Maybe Christmas, he thought...doesn't come from a store.Maybe Christmas, perhaps...means a little bit more!"

The air was tense, as each of the on lookers watched with drawn breath at the card rising from the deck slowly.Its drawer's hand shaking due to nerves at what the faiths might have in store for him.One eye closed, and one eyes opening, Slug looked at the card he had drawn.His face suddenly erupted with joy, as he threw the card before the other players in pride.Written in cursive were the words "Extra Alimony this month"."It appears my no good ex-husband owes me extra alimony this month!"Slug announced,as his character Candice "the stay at home mom and PTA member" received a bonus to her luck stat.A large sigh of disapproval escaped the other players mouths."Oh great...the harlot gets more luck.Was taking your offspring away from him not enough?"Hella, the Grand Priestess of Gaia, asked as she surveyed the room around her.She was playing the character of Amanda "Over achiever and President of the Student body"."In all that is fair...Candice did have a pretty great lawyer."Moluk stated, smirking to herself as she rested face lay in the palm of her hand, elevated by her elbow.The necromancer was referring to herself of course, whose character was Norman "The dirtiest lawyer in the state"."Your tongue may be silver, necromancer.But my baking skills have kept my husband,our adopted son, and I in high standing among the christian community.All this, because of my Brownies."Gri-dor announced, a hearty laugh escaping his heavily bearded mouth.He played Alex "A loving husband, father, and baker"."NOTHING CAN STOP THE MIGHTY ALEX!"Gridor announced, as he stood up to draw the next card.Suddenly, his face grew dark and he slumped down in his seat.His eyes wide with horror, as he looked over the faces of his fellow players."What does it say, mighty Alex?"Slug asked, raising one end of his thick unibrow at the warlord."I...found a lump..." Gri-dor stated, as the other players looked around at each other.It was true, written on the card was the words "you found a lump"."And just after you used your health insurance card to bring your 5 year old to the hospital for his appendix."Moluk mocked taking enjoyment in this, as Gri-dor smashed his goblet of mead in his large hand out of frustration."I CANNOT DIE!What of my family?My bakery?"Gri-dor began to panic, as he looked over his character sheet."Roll to check its severity!"Hella stated, as Gri-dor threw the dice across the table.Hoping it would land on a low number."7.So its treatable, but your relationship with your husband becomes strained as a result and you miss a turn to go to therapy."Hella explained, to a much relieved Gri-dor."But, David stays with me right?"Gri-dor asked, rolling the dice again.Slug let out a laugh at the result."Oh how I love this game!"Moluk announced, clapping in joy.
