Todd blinked in confusion.Todd knew he was just scuba diving, fixing an issue with his regulator, but now he was now in a small gloomy and green childs room.Todd was confused.Todd looked around the room that was covered orderly white wooden and slotted bins all along the walls, which were dark green and paisley textured.There was a white writing desk in the corner and a floral patterned couch in the middle of the far wall.He came back to the little girl that he had first noticed.She looked at him, patiently, through large red horn rimmed glass that had no lenses and kept slipping down her tiny nose.She looked down, adjusted her pink dotted dress, pushed her glasses back on her face before looking up at Todd and asking:

Pardon me, sir.I asked if you would like a seat at our table?We werent expecting more guests, but we would be so grateful if you would join our party.Isnt that right Mrs. Featherton?

The little girl, brushing her shiny curls from her face, looked over at the seat to her left where a stuffed goose sat, dressed in a floppy sunhat with a pearl necklace that slunk like snakes coiling into a knot around her neck, stared blankly, unresponsive, straight ahead.Todd had not expected it to answer.It didnt.Todd felt relieved by this.Please, sit. the girl beckoned him over and pointed with small finger poking out from her laced and ruffled covered fist, to the empty chair to her right

Todd felt uncomfortable being in a strangers place, but felt more uncomfortable about rejecting a little a childs invitation to tea, so he thanked his host and fumbled with the small seat until he was sat awkwardly at the table, but not before falling over backwards.Twice.Well, that was spectacular. The child voiced with glee.You looked so funny Im going to call you... she trailed off into a hum as she tilted her head.She was looking up to some distant point only she could see, a single finger rested to the side of her, before startled with she gasp of delight, snapped her fingers and excitedly declared:
  
Mr.Funny Bunny!
  
Todd felt a stabbing prick and a sucking pop on both his ears.The shock of pain made him screech as he flinched and reached for his ears, his hands bumped into something soft and fuzzy.He grabbed the object and at the same time felt the tip of his ear being grabbed.Still holding the tip of his ear, he pulled his hand in front of him.What he saw was his hand holding a large floppy bunny dolls ear.Todd pulled his hand away in shock, the ear flopping out of his view.Todd had fallen out of the chair again and was anxiously scrambling to get back in it.The child giggled in the background as he got in the chair once more.He looked desperately at the girl for any kind of help, and he was about to ask for it when the girl, still laughing from his toppling over, haltingly said:

Mr.Funny Bunny, you are-   
  
Todd felt the stabbing prick and sucking pop spreading all over his face.- a silly one.Arent you, sir?
  
Todd once again tried to ask for help to get any kind of explanation of how he got here or what was happening to him, but his mouth wouldnt move.Twisting his head, Todd tried to stretch and contort his jaw, but couldnt.Reaching to pry his mouth open, his hand grasped for his lips, but the slipped off something cool and stiff hard before grabbing fuzzy cloth.His hand scrambled and scratched at his face, his fingernails clinking hollowly against what sounded like hard plastic.Todd began to blindly panic.Todd bolted up out of his seat, banging his head on the chandelier again.Rubbing his head, he scanned the room again.The door.Had he seen a door?Todd had noticed in his shock earlier that there was no door in the room.He could not find one now.Bopping into the chandelier a third time, Todd made his way free of the hanging obstacle and turned towards the couch.Where are you going Mr.Funny Bunny the te-

More pricks and pops.This time screaming down his arms like fireants digging out their home under his skin and in his muscles.His chest trembled, like a rat thrashing in a cage, with a scream that couldnt escape.-a has not been served yet and it wont if you keep behaving badly. She said sternly in a nasally clipped tone.Todd, bringing his arms up in front of him he was stricken with a white, cold terror.Toy doll paws on plump and soft velvety arms are what his eyes showed him.Telling his arms to wiggle, he only saw the soft fuzzy limbs flop back and forth.Todd was losing it.Todd ran for a wall where he started to beat on it with his stuffed velvet limbs.Finding his fists effort futile, he began manically kicking and  jumping at the wall with his half plush body, knocking toy bins over spilling stuffed animals and dolls across the room.Todd does not care.Why what a weird dance. The child bubbled with a giddiness.Mr.Funny Bunny, It is n-
  
Searing pain punctures his legs and abdomen.His sides strain as he feels muscle rip and spasm.He is falling as his legs become as weightless as a ball of cotton.-ot time for dancing. She said curtly as she rose from her seat.Todd hits the floor.Now come back to table for tea or youll be excused from the party.Is that clear, Mr.Funny Bunny? the child says sternly.Acidic flashes melted trails of pain over and behind Todds eyes.His eyes become locked open, staring blankly straight ahead, the box of dolls littering the floor filled his vision, each doll with a stiff blank stare on their face.Past the field of scatted toys with  staring eyes, Todd saw feet approaching.Todd felt no connection to the rest of his body as something lifted him up.Just his sight, hearing and mind remained.Todd goes numb.Sinking into shock, he twists in the air until he is face to face with the little girl, which was now as large as a garage door, Im sorry, sir, but you are too rowdy for our tea party. she admonished, Now you will have to wait your turn, like all the other rude guests are, to join our party. She huffed in a hasty manner.Todd, tucked under one of the childs arms, watches her place the knocked over bin back in place.She drops Todd into it, then the other dolls are piled on top of him.His view is half blocked by a slat, but he can see the side profile of the necklaced goose, and the girls back as she sits down and scoots her chair in remarking:

 I apologize madame. the child humbly expressed, But we cant have that kind of behavior at our party, now can we Mrs. Featherton?

Mrs. Featherton did not respond, she only stared, blankly, ahead.
