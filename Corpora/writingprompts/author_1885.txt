And so I arrived.A chamber of white, empty yet filled and comfortable but infinite in volume.Around me, others appeared and others seemingly walked through doors that weren't  there, not appearing the next step or any other.And so I walked.Around me were other wandering souls but there were those who chose to stay with others.After a while, one could pick out those who have become well acquainted with this space and those who were just passing through.And so I watched.I figured that there was some purpose to being here, possibly continuing what I started in life, or maybe it was all just because.Eventually I came to what seemed to be the Center.If it could be called that.There were some vaguely familiar faces and they seemed to have set up here.And so I stood.These were those who were destined to a "life" in Limbo.Those who made their impact.They ranged from scientists and mathmeticians to war generals and artistic icons.All defined by the same destiny.Some decided to wait, aside from the main group.They would sit, and occasionally talk but they seemed content.And so I waited.But they did not stagnate.The Greats would sit and just discuss.They had all the time they needed.This is the time for them to finish their work.However fruitless it felt.At this point, I began to question why I've been afforded so much time before whatever is through those doors.What did I contribute?My work was impossible to be truly proven, even in the end I could not finish my own thoughts.But does it matter.This is just an extension of that on Earth.If that didn't matter, why should this.And why should any other?I watched.I watched as they began to individually disappear.Questioningly as they walked through the doors they swear did not exist for them.But they left.So why am I here?And they panicked and theorized as they could, they were being forgotten.It began with Al Khwawrizmi.The passage of time feeling as dull as it did on Earth.Why?And soon it was me and just a couple of the original group.We sat.I sat._*This was honestly just a stream of consciousness thing and my first response, please don't kill me :D*_
