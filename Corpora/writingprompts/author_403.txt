Some people have it, some people don't, not everyone can be a bouncer - or Eviction Technician as I like to call it.You don't have to be big, but it helps, you don't have to be a cunt, it doesn't help.I worked at one of the largest but dingiest nightclubs in the city called St Saviours, formerly a church as are a lot of clubs here, on a street abutted by many other establishments, mostly trouble free.Being in a city, out of the way, remote and a bit backwards has its perks, there are things you can do which I won't mention here.Being backwards also means that there is a lax attitude towards underagers in the clubs.Most of the guys you worked with were good guys and you knew they would have your back if shit went down but some were cunts and aggravated situations, making them more dangerous than needed.We all took advantage of our positions in some way, some stole, some got the girls, I however, looked constantly for cash dropped on the floor - easily bringing in an extra 70 quid each night, I wish i'd have saved it instead of buying weed.I was working the main floor between site patrols, I was a floater usually, it was the only exercise I got in a day, the sickly smell of the old booze emanating from the floor after the smoking ban(a great thing by the way), the thumping of the bass as they played some crappy r & b, the slutty girls and drugged up guys, bliss.When I was twenty there was a disaster near the city which resulted in radiation exposure for many of the workers, some had died, some were dying and some had mutated DNA, some were crazy and some all of the former.It was being bitten by someone with mutated DNA during one of the regular bouts of violence in the club that allowed me to be more effective at spotting underage folk than all the others, I was lucky though, I never got punched in all of my eight years.It was the end of Summer and Scotland were playing the Netherlands, the club had opened early to allow them in, the rowdy crowd of both fans were getting on famously, I was positioned at the front gate with my mate Marcel controlling the queue.One after another, people came in, people were refused for being drunk and some were refused because the number above their head(the result of being bitten by the disaster survivor) said they were under 18.Things were going well, there had been one or two pints thrown at the projection screen but nothing too serious, friendly and jovial, completely the opposite of a bloody Rangers and Celtic match.One by one he crowd came, one by one they were let in or refused, one couple came up and there was something odd about them, very odd.They each had a number but there was no space, the number said 1819, they were Siamese twins
