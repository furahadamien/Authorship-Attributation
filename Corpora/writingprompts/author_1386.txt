"Whoah."He exhaled shakily, bracing himself from falling backwards."Well?"Roughly a dozen eyes were scrutinizing every subtle movement of his musculature."Vivid.Elaborate, and inceptively stunning."Groans emanated around him.Mutters of "always with the words" and "does he get off on being pretentious, or what?"fluttered aimlessly about the room."We meant about the experience?How was your life as a human on earth?"Suppressed giggles."It was fascinating," he muttered slowly, noticing the multi tubed instrument in front of him for the first time, "I feel as though I've learned a great deal."Dead silence."YOU LEARNED... you learned a great deal."Concise disappointment dripped from his tone."I had no walk-through, no previous instruction."He was still in a bit of a daze."Everything I learned pointed towards constant information gleaning and striving to be a better person.Learning from Socrates, Plato, Ghandi, the Dalai Lama, Jesus Christ, but mostly just good sense and some common decency."At this, tempers were lost."GHANDI??He was a joke!A prank someone pulled after hitting the pipe too hard.He fucked his great niece!""Not exactly, but whatever.""And the debauchery.The hedonism?That was the whole point!And you wasted it...LEARNING!""I happened to find positive lessons that can easily coincide into real life - yet you mock me?""YOU MADE A MOCKERY OF THIS EXPERIENCE BY REFUSING TO UTILIZE ITS PURPOSE!!""And that angers you, I understand, but why?Why should it enrage you so to see me try something differently?What right do you have to tell me I can't keep my morality in fantasy as well as reality?"Heavy sighs, then silence."Once again, you miss the point.Your heart has been hardened to the integral parts of the culture of our species, and I'll have no more of you.""So just like that, you're going to..."
Movement filled the chamber.A quiet rustling noise surrounded him as he felt his physical being float towards the exit.He was still adjusting to being back in his original body."I wonder," he thought to himself, "if smoking a chemical compound from a complex breathing apparatus can cause you to transform into a completely different person on a completely different world, then how can we assume THIS is our natural state?In fact, would it not be even more logical to assume our culture as a species has grown more and more convoluted over the millennia, watered down by the same discovery of the same chemical combination and the same apparatus in each subsequent life, all in the name of 'preserving' such a 'life'?"At that moment, he was gently tossed out the door, landing on what he would have called his ass on earth."Oh well."He brushed himself off and began to trudge on, "I guess that's just not the point."
