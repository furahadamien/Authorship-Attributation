FINALCOUNTDOWN99
Oh.Man, if I died today and this happened, I'd feel really sorry for the versions of me in the theater that had to watch my life.Brief summary, I was born, moved, became a space obsessed introvert, did a few cool things, and then had a crush on this girl for 3.5 years before finding out she was a lesbian.Yaaaa I'm pretty pathetic.But the odds that I was the most pathetic one are pretty slim, though...
