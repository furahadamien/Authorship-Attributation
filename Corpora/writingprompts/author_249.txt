"Hang on, so there's some fixed amount of power and it's divided equally among all humans?""Yep.""And you, a strange alien creature, have culled the human population in order to increase the power granted to any one individual?""Exactly.Do you want to try out your new powers?""I've a few questions first actually -- as a more advanced intelligence you're certainly aware of evolution, of the fact that all life forms here on earth share a common ancestor, of the fact that distinct species arise by a process of natural selection, where only those which adapt best to their environment survive?""Go on..."

"And you're telling me that the human species possess some special access to magical powers, with the magnitude of each individual's access _depending explicitly on the number of other alive humans_?"Yeah.Is there a problem?""You bet there's a problem.What we call human life is unavoidably arbitrary.If we draw up the family tree showing the ancestry of all humans, at some point we make it back to some gross slime that definitely isn't human, and so at some point between today and whenever the slime was around we need to choose some generation and say 'Ok, after this we're human'.Maybe before we were neanderthal, or what have you, but neanderthal is just a label we made up too, every species is.You're telling me that whether or not an organism is labeled human actually has (1) some effect on the organism, and, worse, (2) some effect on every other organism we call human.But as I've argued, these labels are completely arbitrary.""You know you can fly now?Don't you want to try that out?""We even have a maximally human organism, against which all other organisms are compared to test their human-ness?It's Carl Linnaeus -- in honour of all the work he did on species #Lectotype) and granted him the title of Ur-human.Which means that everyone alive today is slightly less human than some family of Swedish nerds in the 1700s.And if we'd happened to have chosen someone else, we'd have a different ordering of humanity in terms of human-ness.""You can teleport!You could go somewhere else, somewhere far far away, _right now_.Wouldn't that be fun?""Worse, we haven't stopped evolving.At some point in the future we'll be so far from Carl Linnaeus that we'll need a new label to describe us.Do those powers disappear then?Once we arbitrarily decide to call ourselves something else?Seems hard to believe really.""Oh My God do you know this is why no one has bothered to contact you people all this time?I'm leaving.Do us all a favour and don't go developing any sort of space exploration program.If I see a human come anywhere near our star system I will see to their Zapping myself.""How will you decide whether the organism is human or not?"
