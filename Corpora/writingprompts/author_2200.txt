Much magical blood has been spilled tonight, The dark lords voice resonated through Harrys mind like a freezing wind cutting through the winter night, and for nothing; defending the one who would let you all die to protect himself.

Harrys eyes rose to the faces of those surrounding him in the Great Hall; the faces of his friends, his classmates, and his professors.All eyes stared into an infinite abyss, focusing on the serpentine voice sounding through their minds.His scar flickered like a smoldering ember.Collect your dead.I have called of my Death Eaters to allow you this privilege.You have fought well; you have fought valiantly; but you have one hour before my forces will unleash an insurmountable power upon the school that no amount of bravery can match.

Harry stood, unmoving, as he felt Hermiones grip loosen from his hand.He watched as she fell to her knees and buried her face into Rons shoulder; her bosom heaving with her staggered breaths.A single tear ran over her cheek and down her neck, collecting with it the blood and soot that was smeared over her marble skin, before retreating into the cleavage of her chest.Fred laid motionless before them as the family kissed by fire surrounded his lifeless body, broken in agony.His twin sat crumpled, with his face smothered into his elbows, wailing at the new emptiness that lay in his soul.The comfort of companionship that had always been was now replaced with an abyssal void echoing into infinity.George was alone.A lump rose in Harrys throat that he couldnt swallow.His eyes burned with tears as he choked back the unwavering feeling of defeat.What could he do?How could he fix it?He couldnt.He had lost.There was a resounding explosion as the monstrous oak doors to the Great Hall slammed closed.Eyes rose and fell back to the bodies scattered across the floor.Padma Patel wailed, holding her sisters head against her chest, as Professor Trelawney whispered to her; unable to sooth yet another grieving twin recognizing a new sense of abandonment in the world.Pavartis eyes were closed and her face looked at peace.Her hair was strewn across her sisters lap as if it was carried with the wind.She could have been dancing.Harrys heart sank.Then he heard it.The strings began to play a very different sort of song.No one sang the words, but Harry knew The Raines of Castamere when he heard it.He rushed toward the doors as he saw Gregory Goyle making his way to the back of the Hall.It took only eight strides before he reached the retreating Slytherin, grabbing the cuff of his cloak.Goyle spun to face Harry, his shocked face and gaping mouth slowly curled into a menacing grin as the enchanted stings grew louder and played the tune with gusto.From the corner of his eye, Harry saw Ron move to stand behind Goyle with his wand drawn.Rons face was scarlet with rage, a single pulsating vein protruded from his forehead, as he slowly began raising his wand.Suddenly, his face warped to a twisted and confused expression.A flash of green cast Rons shadow on the sandy brick wall for a split second before he fell to the ground.The flash stayed in Harrys sight and he stood silent, staring at the silhouette of his best friend who laid dead before him.Another green flash blinded the room.And another; another; and another again.Harry did not see the sixth flash.
