A ball of light twisted and warped in the middle of a desert.A sound of electricity- something not used until centuries in the future- buzzed and a man stepped out of the ball as it collapsed.This man looked odd for his time- wearing Union fatigues, carrying pouches of ammunition and with a musket slung over his shoulder- and he didn't feel like destroying the timeline that week.He took out a flint and steel from the ammo pouch, stripped off his clothes, and poured some gunpowder on them, just to be safe, before lighting them ablaze.Then he decided to look for some water.He found an oasis- one occupied by some slave traders who saw easy pickings in a naked, muscular, lost man.*It could have gone worse,* the man thought a few hours later as he was shoved ahead to a market.*They could have tried to rip out my time travel implants, or tried to-*
His thoughts were immediately cut short- rather fortunately- by a voice calling him, with his implanted translator reporting something along the lines of "I'll buy him."After he was exchanged, the man looked up at his new owner and smiled."Well, John, did you miss me all that time?"John's new owner was a man named Arthur, one that seemed to show up just when John decided to switch time periods.He figured it's not too hard when you're immortal."I don't know...When are we, anyway?"Arthur shrugged."Giza, sometime in BCE.The Pyramids are the next big thing, looking really pretty while under construction."John rolled his eyes.They'd both seen things that he was sure looked better than any pyramid."If only we could go forward and see how they look when they're done."That night, after Arthur got John some proper Egyptian clothes and jokingly ordered him to clean the house, John sat thinking about the two's friendship.It was awfully convenient, really, that an immortal be around when John's lab tested out their time traveling tech.How did they meet, anyway?Ah, right, that's how...



Arthur sat on a broken Moon.He'd always wondered what the Moon was like.It looked better in his head, especially without the Earth, where he'd seen his friends and family live and die, his only home be destroyed, and now all of be wiped away by an ever-hungry Sun.He clearly didn't think this immortality thing through.He wanted someone- just one person- who was like him.Traveling, leaving everything behind day after day, becoming someone new each time.Then he heard a sound of electricity- something destroyed on Earth centuries in the past- buzz behind him.A man collapsed behind him, wearing a space suit."Wow.Stealing this thing was... Wooh," the man panted, "How are you here without one?"Arthur looked back at Earth.Whoever this man was, he probably was as stuck here as Arthur was."Hey, I'm talking to you!Come on," the man kept persisting, "I'm heading to the Iron Catastrophe next, and you must be able to survive those conditions.What do you say?"Arthur looked back again, more hopeful this time.The man was sticking out his hand."Name's John.Hold on."A ball of light started to form around the two."Heh," John said as they started to transfer to another age, "that rhymed."
