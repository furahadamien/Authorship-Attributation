You wake up, and for the first time in years, you feel the pain of bright light on your eyes.*Wait, light?!* you jump out of your bed and close the green curtains on your window.'Oh my God.I-I can-" you immediately stop talking as you look on your wall and see writing in neat, red marker,

"Don't tell them you can see.Act like everything is normal.Carry out your day as usual."Following the strange writing you decide not to shout it to the rooftops like you thought of, but open the door to your bathroom.On the mirror, in the same, neat writing,

"Nothing has changed.Pretend to be blind."you start to feel uneased, scared if someone is in your apartment.You slowly exit your bathroom, grab some non-safety scissors, and search the kitchen, your small office, and the living room.In each room you see more of the writing, telling you to not change anything in your daily life, to act natural; in every room the writings become more frequent, more aggressive, and more insistent that you should never reveal this recovery to anyone, even the people you trust the most.No one is in your apartment, that for sure, but one thing is certain:

In the last two years, someone was, and you had no idea."DING DONG!"rings the doorbell, snapping you out of this unnerving thought.You travel to your intercom, and say:

"Who is it?""It's James, duh!"Ah, yes.James, your best friend since college and your co-worker at Roy Industries, a company that started in manufacturing, specializing in disability aides such as: canes, hearing aides, wheelchairs, and stair-lifts, and after the Great Blinding, with everyone needing their products, grew into a ginormous cooperation that has a stake in almost every industry; everyone has heard of them, and most rely on Roy In.for their paycheck as well.You work in the admistrative section of the company, and so does John, you often walk to work together, as motor vehicles became too dangerous after The Great Blinding.Sure, it takes a while, but you live in the city, so at least it's not too bad of a commute; some people had to quit their jobs or move so they could work after the loss of an entire sense.Luckily, you lived close enough to not have to change your home/job, and so did John."You ready to go?"John asked."What?Oh, sure.Let me just get my cane."Will write more soon, I just wanted to get the beginning on paper.(or, should I say, computer) Anyway, see you soon!
