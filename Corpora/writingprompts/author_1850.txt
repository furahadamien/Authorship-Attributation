I woke up this morning with a resolute decision, to not try escaping anymore.I'm starting to think the ones that designed this prison have a luck rating of 101.For example, every cliche mean of escaping works...at first.Want to dig out?The guard drops the spoon when taking your lunch tray back.Spoon not strong enough?The first spot you try is the weak one.Anyway, once you get to the sewage line (of course), something incredibly unlikely happens to stop you from escaping.Last week it was the pipe breaking, sending you right to the wardens office.One way or another, through planning or luck, solo missions or cooperation, something dumb happens and you're back to square one.Maybe one day I'll actually be lucky and freedom come to me.I spoke too soon, as I was thinking of how to spend my time...as planning escape is no longer needed, a rift opened right through my cell.Quite rapidly, the walls and soon the whole prison complex split into two.That's when the stench hit me, a strange combination of overdue flesh and sewage...the sewage I'm oh so used to swimming in has got nothing in what I'm smelling now.As sudden as it came, the stench disappeared, and as soon as the debris settled, I can see why.A translucent barrier of sorts erected itself across the sky, separating what's left of the prison from the outside world.Now, being in prison all my life, I've never seen the outside, but I know for sure that something is off.The air had an odd yellow tinge to it and there doesn't seem to be any sign of life in the many miles that I can see.It didn't take much to realize that life is better on this side, and that I lucked out after all.
