*Calm down*, I think to myself.*This guy is probably some crazy psycho who escaped from some hospital somewhere and somehow got himself a gun and shot my wallet.Yep, perfectly normal state of affairs here.Glad he's not a mugger!*
 
I watch as the man engaged the safety, and began explaining his actions, as he pocketed his gun behind him."You may not know it ma'am, but you were in terrible danger just now.That thing you though was a wallet there?That was a witch's familiar.It was probably going to lead you to its mistress' lair, where your soul would have been absorbed as essence."I wondered if I heard him right.Then again, he did just shoot my wallet."Um, witches?""Yep, witches.They've hidden themselves in normal society, but yeah they exist.They feed on the souls of innocent citizens like yourself, usually by leading them to their lair by influencing their victims with their familiars.Why do you think you're even in this dark alley in the first place?"I took a glance around me.This place *was* kind of seedy.Guess it didn't fit my obviously lady-like image."But I was taking a shortcut," I tried to explain."That's what makes 'em so terrifying.You THINK you're doing what you want, sure- but that's all part of the spell.You were lucky I got to you when I did.Well, they don't call me the best hunter in the business for nothing."I started to sweat a little.First witches, now hunters?Seriously?Damn, this guy is the real deal."Welp, none of this has anything to do with you, of course," he drawled, turning his back to me."Just run along, forget this ever happened, and thank your lucky stars I was here when you needed it."I breathed a sigh of relief."I'm afraid I can't do that," I muttered."Well, I understand it's difficult to live normally after knowing all this but you have to-"
 
"No no, you misunderstand.I can't move along because *you just shot my familiar, asshole.*"
 
"Wha-"
 
The shock barely managed to register before I shot him with the gun I just managed to steal from his holster."Y-you-" he coughed from the ground, unable to move.Well, I did shoot him in a pretty bad place for a human.I watched on as he struggled futilely on the ground, jerking several times before the light left his eyes.I sighed as I went to retrieve my wallet."Hey, Lotte, you still alive?""*Cough* t-that was mean, master!You just gave me up without any resistance?""Well, I thought I could snag an easy one, but he turned out to be a hunter...well, at least he's dead!""You didn't manage to absorb his soul though.""Shaddup," I growled, fiddling with the hole in Lotte."Ow, ow, ow, don't vent your frustrations on ME, master!""And what was with that screech at the end?You trying to give me away?Good thing he was stupid enough to not suspect why I was carrying around a wallet-familiar in the first place.Must be my beautiful, innocent face.""He probably though you looked like a homeless mugger.I mean, with your- OW OW OW!I'M SORRY!"I stopped torturing Lotte and sighed.What a troublesome day.It might have been easier if I did run into a crazy guy...now I had to hide a body, sew up Lotte, and get the hell out of here before someone came to investigate the gunshots.Oh well.Just another day in the life of an ordinary witch.
