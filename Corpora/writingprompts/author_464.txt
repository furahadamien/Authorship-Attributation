I was trying to book a hire craft for my family's trip to Napis Morai when the message appeared in my inbox.IMPORTANT: MR MARCUS RICHARDSON: You have been summoned to your local HUB!Immediate response required. 

I opened the message.Please select from the following appointment slots to see your local HUB Administrator.YOU MUST RESPOND WITHIN 24 HOURS.Failure to do so will result in 0.3% debt added to your account and a further 0.15% for each subsequent 24 hour period of inactivity. 

I sank back into my chair as I browsed the available appointment times; the threat of a debt penalty triggering some instinctive reaction within me  a rebelliousness that I had inherited from my father.I could always respect authority but the threat of punishment always left a sour taste in my mouth.Still, I couldn't afford the debt.I had just resigned from my post as manager of the Lithium Exchange; my new job at the Cobalt Foundry paid less and did not start for another four weeks.For almost ten years I had worked for the Lithium Exchange.It had been fun at first, working with some interesting characters, progessing to the manager's position.But it was time for a change.The Cobalt Foundry was a lower salary but it had more paid holiday and better employee benefits.Besides, being in between jobs for a few weeks had given me the chance to take some time back for myself.I had the time to clean the solar panels on the house, take long afternoon baths and grow my beard out without having to keep it tidy for work.I had no plans for the next day so I selected the earliest available appointment.I did wonder why I needed to go to the HUB (or Human Union Base) but I could only assume they wanted to complete an exit survey for Lithium Exchange.Four other managers had quit in the last six months and I guessed the board were starting to worry.The next morning I took the mag-tube to the HUB.It was in the central complex, around 30 miles from my habitation dome.Once I had signed in to the reception terminal I was escorted directly to the Administrator's office by an orderly.The Administrator was a silver-haired, middle-aged man, by the name of Rowlands.He shook my hand as I entered, 

Mr Richardson, please take a seat, he gestured towards the chair in front of his desk.We both sat down.Do you know why you are here?

I haven't a clue, I replied, and if I were to make a guess it woud be that you want me to complete an exit interview for Lithium Exchange?

Rowlands' little smile disappeared briefly as he pursed his lips.Ah no, changing his tone from friendly to serious.Although, I am saddened to see Lithium Exchange lose more key personnel, I will not be conducting an exit survey today.I do hope they get their house in order, though, and review their employment package as we cannot risk closing down another commercial unit in this region. He stopped himself abruptly and looked as though he had already said too much.I knew that the local economy was struggling but it was a situation shared by many outposts across the system since the Lunar Crisis.What I do need to talk to you about, Mr Richardson, is something of greater importance, Rowlands produced a file from the desk in his drawer.Er, OK, I said, starting to wonder what this was all about.Don't worry, Mr Richardson, it is good news.Very good news for you and your family. He pulled a document from the file and handed it over to me.This was given to me yesterday morning.It arrived from Sol Central, Rowlands paused and focused his gaze on me, from Earth.

Earth? it had come as a shock, I have no business with Earth.My parents weren't born there.I am a fully fledged, second generation settler. I was worried.If it was a summons to Earth then I was going to have to cancel the family trip.Or accept a fine of more debt.Both of which I could not afford.Mr Richardson, please, Rowlands said soothingly, trying to calm me before I got too hysterical, if you would just read the document. I opened the paper across my lap and began to read its contents:

*THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR ADMINISTRATOR ROWLANDS OF REGION 210, PLANET 2, ALPHA CENTAURI SYSTEM.Administrator Rowlands,

Please read carefully the attached documents and arrange an appointment with the relevant citizen.Once you have completed the handover of the inheritance, make sure you contact Sol Central Archiving Department within 72 hours.Failure to do so will result in 0.5% debt added to your account and a further 1% for each subsequent 24 hour period of inactivity.Reginald F. Cummings, Lead Archivist, Sol Central Archiving Department.*

Inheritance? I said, looking up at Administrator Rowlands, what inheritance? My father was an agricultural engineer who had left me his debts when he passed five years ago, and my mother was now living with my sister in a region in the southern hemisphere.I knew very little of my family history and hadn't ever thought to look into it.What do you know about star registration, Mr Richardson? Rowlands stood up from his chair and walked over to his window, it overlooked the north side of the central complex.The sun was breaking through the orange clouds and the glow was causing his blinds to automatically operate.Star registration? I shook my head and pulled a face, I have never heard of it.
