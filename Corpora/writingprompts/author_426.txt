I did not want this job.They probably wanted a woman for it because maternal instincts and non-threatening demeanor ...Scrap that.If that were the case, they would have picked someone else.Someone pretty with a warm voice and a closet full of pastel-colored fluffy sweater sets.Why the fuck did I go into a career in diplomacy?Right, the dream: travel the world; meet people from all parts of the globe; experience different cultures; eat a lot of good food.Yeah, I should have gone into piloting.Same opportunities, no chance of landing this gig.I did not want this job.There is absolutely no precedent for this situation in all of human history.I am completely flying by the seat of my pants.First ambassador to the United States in 50 years.5 - 0.FIFTY!How the fuck did anyone think this was a good idea?We used to make fun of hermit states.Still, following World War 3, apparently the best course of action was a 50 year time-out for the culprit.Only we didn't tell them the time-out was just for them.I was twelve when the Marion Island Treaty was signed.People still tell anecdotes of state leaders having to pitch tents in muddy ground because there wasn't enough room for everyone at the research base in the middle of the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean.After 35 days of grueling negotiations, the world's 195 nations reached an agreement to completely close borders, isolate everyone from each other, and reconvene 50 years hence on the tiny South African island of Marion to negotiate rapprochement.That's what I assume kids are taught in the history books of the United States.If they still have history books, that is.I wouldn't know.Nobody would know because we haven't communicated with them in 50 years!Our history books tell a different story: the story of the tribe of 55.The African Union, host of the peace talks, came to the summit with a plan.They had decided to treat the aggressor as they would a deadly infectious disease: quarantine.The problem lay in convincing the remaining 139 nations that it was in their best interest to participate in the biggest political ruse the world had ever seen.158 countries against one.Somehow, it worked.Somehow, 55 African leaders convinced 139 others that the world's conflicts could be solved if only the United States of America were quarantined.What followed were the Aurora Australis Accords, aptly named for being agreed upon in clandestine night-time negotiations under the southern lights.During the day, broad negotiations were steered onto the path of complete isolation of all individual nations.At night, assurances were made and eye-popping horse-trades of territories and resources commenced over the course of the next 30 days.All the while the President of the United States remained blissfully ignorant.As part of the Marion agreement, it was stipulated that each country would recall their citizens, and then implement complete border closure and communications blackout before informing their population of the terms of the treaty.My dad used to say, "Democracy went into cardiac arrest."He was a surgeon.He liked to use medical metaphors a lot.I feel like I'm going into cardiac arrest right now.50 years ago, in my grandparents' generation, 158 people made a choice that changed the course of the entire world.Today, I get to explain that choice to a whole nation that has been isolated since then.Me.Not a president, not a chancellor, not even a high level cabinet member of some sort.Just a career diplomat who made a life out of making friends and negotiating peaceful solutions to tough issues.That's where integrity will get you.When it comes time to pull a name out of the hat, you can be sure you and everyone else put in yours.Don't kill the messenger.Maybe I should open with that?I have no idea what to expect.Nobody does.Somehow the biggest con of the world also became the longest lasting.50 years of time-out and silent treatment for one nation out of 159.I assume that to be true.I can't imagine the US would still be under the Cloak if they had caught wind of the truth.The Cloak.Fuck, it'll be pandemonium when that comes down.They'll get the rest of the internet back, and every single thing they missed will be right there, waiting.Unless they developed tech that's too different from ours and they can't connect.What if they can't connect?What if their computers don't speak the same language anymore?That thing about Moore's law.I'm gonna be sick.How the fuck did anyone think this was a good idea?The itinerary is as vague as the circumstances command: 09:00 am arrival at Marion Research Station helipad; 10:00 am official breakfast with the representative of the United States of America.10 minutes.I have 10 minutes before I have to explain to the representative of the United States that they have been the victim of an international long-con for the past 50 years.My cousin, the linguist, assures me they will speak English but he expects I'll bump into odd pronunciations or neologisms ("What?""New words they introduced into their common vernacular.""Oh.").I wonder what words they'll use when I tell them the truth.The corridor leading from my cabin to the cafeteria in the main building is the longest stretch of grey-green linoleum I have ever walked.The security detail two steps behind me is raising the hair on the back of my neck.I usually don't travel with security detail."Could you ...not?"My spastic hand motions are a terrible way to convey the level of discomfort I feel at their unnatural proximity.I am a diplomat.I speak four languages.I can do better."Would you please consider adopting a more relaxed presence?There is no reason to suspect an imminent threat.Everyone has been screened.The research staff are all highly respected members of the scientific community.I'm going to be fine.It's just coffee and continental breakfast."If I really believed that, my heart wouldn't be pounding a mile a minute, but I manage to hide that fact behind the layers of African cotton, Turkish silk, and Chinese nylon that make up my battle armor from the outside in.I am wearing my big girl panties.I can do this.The big guys in black suits reluctantly concede.The older, gruffer looking guy falls back a few more steps while the younger man - Joseph?Jonah?Just Joe?- closes the distance and falls into step beside me."Sorry, if we're making you uncomfortable," he says in a quiet rumble.His accent is Cape Town."This is big, you know?"Years of diplomatic experience suppress any off-the-cuff responses and instead recall an ambassadorial frequent flyer:

"I understand."We have reached the point of no return.It is an unremarkable brown metal door with a long horizontal push bar to open it.I have no idea what waits for me behind that door.I don't even have time for a deep breath before Joe pushes it open.Part 1/2
