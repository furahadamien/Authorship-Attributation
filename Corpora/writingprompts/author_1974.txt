Roughly 3 hours (or three days I didn't really bother to keep time these days) after that conversation I sat on a table trying to decide wether to itch at the space between the tracking bracket and my wrist or at the crusty bandages over my eyes.. or maybe I could manage both?I continued to attempt such a feat till I heard it coming toward me, it continued talking to itself as it fiddled with  the bandagesaround my head till they suddenly loosened, something smashed to the floor, suddenly I was on the other side of the room, something hot dribbled over my lips, sounds muted out and disappeared and for a moment everything was chaotic fear, then I fell to the floor closing my eyes shut gasping for air and the calmness that would hopefull come with it, I touched my hand to my ear, transfer the molten substance then peeked at my hand, It glistend with colors, yup definitely blood, but also not?My hand glistend with thousands of colors, I slowly looked up at the alien being looking bow at me, it was talking again but no longer to its self, another creature floated by it's side, stranger still they both eminated radiant colors, my original keeper picked up a helmet with cords dangling from it and popped it one my head before hurriedly typing something into a computer then he stopped, turning to look at me the color around him changed to something closer to a sickly green, that was the day they found out humans can see emotions with the full color spectrum

"Well I can't see shidadle now" I replied, breafly touching the rugged bandages covering my eyes before going back to itching at the small space between the tracking bracelet and my wrist,
