Ive always watched from the sidelines when I see heroes and villains fight, never interfering.While yes, I was far more powerful than them, Id rather sit back in a coffee shop and drink a cappuccino.That was how I acted for years, but, it came to a point when heroes were considered special, everyones favourite hero was Ohm, he had his own cereal, his own national holiday, hell, people wanted autographs of him more than they wanted autographs of an actual *good* celebrity.I decided that its time for powered individuals to be put in check.I started planning months in advance, due  to me having pure natural Elegy (the power that superheroes and villains were bestowed upon over 40 years ago) it was an easy task.On the National Holiday for Ohm, I staged a bank robbery, I controlled 5 criminals to attack a measly bank near where Ohm was.I knew hed arrive to make himself look good, my predictions were correct, he arrived in 57 seconds and 73 milliseconds flat.I watched as he zapped the criminals, punched them through walls and knocked them out, then I burst through the roof, my armour didnt even have a scratch.Ah, let me guess, a villain.Trying to kill me, go on with your monologue about how youre the most powerful villain and you have me in your grasp and then I simply knock you unconscious. He started to laugh, along with civilians who watched from the sidelines.Oh youre not speaking?Thats a pity, your armour makes you look like youd do a great monologue.

Ohm started to walk away, he thought I was weak, but I wasnt.I fired a rope like beam from my hand and wrapped it around his neck, he went to grab it to try tear it off, but it simply cut his hands in two.With one small pull, I ripped his head from his body.46 years of heroes, and I was the first to kill one.They call me a villain, but just because Im exterminating the heroes, doesnt mean I am.Im a saviour.
