Heaven's a great library, and everyone has a library card.Even those destined for hell have a library card.I was alone, sat in a room with a large book.It's cover was dusty, as if waiting for me.I knew as soon as I opened it that time would stand still.God told me that.God told me everything that wasn't in this book.I could have been a painter, a truly great painter like Rembrandt.The book had all these illustrations I drew, every single one.From doodles on napkins to a mural I could have painted in a Roman cathedral.My real life, the one that ended much sooner than this chapter was a good read.I saw all my decisions at once.I always seemed to take the destructive path, the immoral path.I knew what I had achieved in life, but to see it all on paper is something else.A long list of every life I had touched, had maimed, had been in the presence of.The book had no end, there was an infinite number of pages.More of them dedicated to my possibilities of being a world class artist.By comparison, my real life was miniscule and short."Do you regret any choices you've made?"asked God."No."I lied."Well, maybe the suicide.""Of course" said God, "we all regret our death.If we had just one more day, we could rule the world.""I did rule the world, once."I said."Once."God led me up from the chair and down a set of stairs.A long and winding staircase.The heat was unbearable by the time I got to the last step."Adolf, my son, this is your room."said God.
