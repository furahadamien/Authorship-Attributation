What irony.Perfect marks in school without trying.I never really studied, but somehow once I put pen to paper it was like the answers just flowed out of my brain and to my hand.I was quarterback too.Every time I flung that ball into the air, it spiraled spectacularly into the receivers hands.I always knew I was a little different in those regards.I think my parents did too, and they taught me well enough not to fuck people over.You see, everyone has a luck rating.It ranges from 1 to 100 and you don't get tested until you are 21.We all knew at some point before my birthday that I was up there on the scale, but no one thought I would end up in prison...

No one really knew what happened to people who were perfect 100's.It was all speculation.I mean there are some unlucky fucks who literally get hit by a plane falling out of the sky, and then ones that are constantly scamming their way through life without any consequences.I was neither, but I went down to the Department of Human Affairs as soon as I turned 21, got tested and immediately thrown into to prison.No trial.No explanation.Just my cell.Like I said.What irony.They never actually told me what I rated, but at this point it was pretty obvious.I know, I know.You're thinking if I am that lucky, just walk out.It happens all the time.Every fucking day.An inmate walks out through some stroke of ridiculous luck and one of the guards will fire their rifle in the general direction of an unseen inmate escaping and well, it's never a kill but they are certainly not walking anywhere after that.The only logical thing is the guards are just as lucky.Why didn't I get chosen as one of them.Like I said.I don't fuck people over.The prison is not as bad as media portrays in movies and television.A lot of these people are not criminals.Just got the unluckiest luck rating.Most days I sit and wonder what separates us from the 99's.They could easily exploit just as much as us Perfects can.Personal gain, or otherwise.It might not be dangerous here, but for fucks sake it is boring.Most of my life I've always been able to entertain myself.I remember once going for a walk in the middle of the summer.I saw a 100 dollar bill laying on the edge of the woods and walked to grab it.Something caught my eye in the thick of the trees and I found a nice little lake that seemingly no one knew about.It was my special place.I wish I could go back.I'm waiting for some answers, or if nothing else something to happen.If this luck thing is real, when the fuck is it going to come back.Does it run out?Does it go dormant?I have a small barred window in my cell and the sky is turning black.It is going to storm.The first one since I've been here.Maybe this could be a stroke of luck for us Perfects.What irony.EDIT:Sorry for any grammatical or spelling errors.I really liked the prompt but I'm on break at work and did this on my phone, when I would much rather have my laptop.Thanks for reading or any comments.
