Chapter 1:

Two birds with one stone.Those were grandfather Elon's last words.He hadn't whispered them, no.He had invented them... and engraved them onto the side of the titanium sphere.It was no secret that our family had been part of the revolution.Grandpa's effect on the world had been as far reaching anyone could've imagined.His constant innovating and activism, and his unwavering commitment to ultimate truth had been garnering unwanted attention since before any of us were even born.It's a miracle they even pardoned him after the corporations finally shut it down.Strange as it seems, things felt pretty normal for us.How was I supposed to know that 10' by 10' crate in the basement was any different from the myriad of inventions and rocket parts gathering dust in storage?In fact, I hadn't even noticed it until its specific mention in our power of attorney meeting last fall.Grandad had been deteriorating and all I had wanted to do was see to his care.Who the fuck leaves their grandkids a time machine?!Chapter 2:
"Box Clause"

(I swear I have a whole plot outline drawn up for this, but I have to go to bed.Will try to finish up tomorrow.If you want it, PM me and I will share it with you.)
