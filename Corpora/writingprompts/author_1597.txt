Intelligence is a funny thing, and just as funny as it is, it's fickle.This was something I learned how to learn, learned, and then re-learned in the span of 20 minutes.I was having a somewhat difficult time deciding if I had just experienced something real, something worth remembering, though at the same time, if I had not experienced it, I wouldn't even be thinking of if I should remember it.Before that strangely real and incredibly vivid dream, I wouldn't even be able to have this existential crisis in the first place, because I wasn't able to think of anything to be existential about, I was a monkey.Well... perhaps not a monkey, in actual fact I appear to be an alien simian being relating more to chimps, though with clear differences.To assume alien is strange, though, given that I have been this ape for my whole life, and yet after the dream, I only now know that there is such a thing as an alien ape like I am.So am I the ape, or am I the human being that i have learned everything I am from?Given it is the body I am currently inhabiting, I will concede to myself that I am the ape.Although, to assume that I am inhabiting the ape would mean that I am not actually the ape, but I digress.It seems there are more important things to do in order to continue this life.Firstly, food.A memory of tiny, zebra-like animals seems to get my large, sharper, canine teeth salivating, and so I set out to find a herd.They are usually found of the thick undergrowth of the lush jungles I've been sleeping in, and sure enough I find a pack of them below me, grazing on the blue grass that curls up like silly string and floats freely in the air.It isn't too hard to catch one, I'd done it a hundred times, and after a hundred times you know how to do anything by heart.Or so I assume, from my dream.Now, also assuming from my dream, I am now a pacifist, and an animal lover.I have a sudden need to battle myself on the ethical dilemma of if it is right to hurt, even kill another animal to sustain myself.After taking a look around to find and remember that the only edible fruit available to me literally tastes like the feces of my dream-selfs world, I quickly - if squeamishly - strike the tiny striped gazelle over the head with a rock.Pushing down my feces-tasting fruit lunch as I have to hit it again, and holding back the interestingly pungent tears that have begun welling in my eyes, one final blow to the beings head renders it dead, and the brains begin to pour out of the head.They are a very bright purple, and covered in a darker purple goop that, if one were to say the word "ooze," they would immediately think of exactly what I was seeing, except purple, if ones personal description of ooze was not purple.Next was something I was proud of, I had learned it as a child, during a camping trip as a Boy Scout.Yet also as a child, I learned how to skin these animals with my bare hands and slowly slurp it down like noodles, before drinking the brains out and using the skull to- I would go on, but even if I did it myself, the feces-fruit is coming back up due to a new set of moral guidelines that I hadn't had 20 minutes ago.During the week I was out at camp those many, many years ago, (and by many years, I of course mean about 20 minutes ago, during the nap I had in a tree,) I learned how to make a fire.This was an invaluable tool out in the wilderness, and my newly formed sense of pride would allow me great satisfaction in showing the other monkeys this incredible spectacle.It wasn't difficult to find what I needed, a good stick, a hard rock, and some easily burnable items.Next to my catch I sat down and within a circle of stones filled with tinder, I began the laborious process of using friction to heat up and ignite the tinder.Only, even with my simeon strength and endurance, the tinder did not ignite, or even smoke.It was impossible to get the damn thing to work, and I didn't have to learn how to be frustrated.I slammed the stick down on the rock and huffed loudly, this was not working and I would have to find another way to spark a flame.Images of a lighter or matches teased me, they were just as tangible as the powerful knowledge I had accumulated, and yet infinitely more useless.Not so useless was the simeon language now being hollered at me by my family.They seem to be in distress about something, but my simeon is a bit rusty, I haven't spoken it in a century.With the added need of having to stop and think about that, I was unable to translate the screeching before my untimely demise.My reign as the smartest being on the planet had a somewhat coincidentally hilarious ending.If I had been able to translate the apes language, it was not anything helpful, as it did nothing to warn me of the actual threat: a massive cat-like beast with incredible fangs and a swishing, dual tail.Instead, if one were to translate what the monkeys had said (into something that any human being reading this would understand,) they would find the apes had said simply; "watch out, stupid."
