Sotha, my alien friend, walked into my house, and sniffed an old Homestuck shirt I had on the floor."Yes, Marjory, this has the mark of the Ghoosha on it."I picked it up, and flung it across my room, disgusted by the rancid odor."Benny must have peed on this!That cat!"Sotha cringed a bit."Well, cat to them is like what monkey is to you."I looked around for Benedict, my Siamese cat, and found him on my bedroom chair, sleeping away."So... Ghoosha... can see ultraviolet?And they can communicate through... spraying?Benny!"Sotha stroked their paw on Benny's fur, and woke him up."Benny, your Ghoosha roommate, is an introvered being, but sometimes he needs to protect you from others like them that might want to hurt you."I picked up Benedict, and stroked his fur, while Sotha's face lit up."Well, Marjory.I like how he trusts you to pick him up.It's like you're a giant Ghoosha yourself to him.We've been studying their and your species' behavior for years, and it seems like this is an acceptable symbiotic relationship among the two rulers of Earth.It's like you built civilization together."I brought up the topic of dogs, and Sotha told me they were just pack animals, as he offered Benedict a bowl of grilled fish.Ghoosha are strange beings.
