John blinked away the blindness that had overtaken him, his ears filled to the brim with the sound of the car horn and tires screeching fading into a constant dull ringing.As he regained his vision, his heart skipped a beat and his brain seemed to short circuit.Where the hell was he?His hearing came back to him, replaced by an equally deafening silence as he realized that the occupants of the movie theater in which he had mysteriously found himself were all watching him.Hadn't he been walking home from the bar?Did he just black out and imagine those headlights careening towards him?Taking a deep breath to center himself, John made his way towards one of the aisles and took a seat.Most of the people near the front stopped staring and turned away to aim their sights at the barren canvas of the movie screen.As if to defy their attempted return to normalcy, a younger kid, John thought he might be in his teens despite his face being cloaked in shadow, hopped over two aisles and threw himself into the seat beside John, "Sup?"He felt immediately annoyed.It was mostly the embarrassment.Who the hell blacks out on a couple of beers and wanders into a movie theater?As the kid started to talk to him, John's eyes closed and he drew in a deep breath.The smell of stale popcorn and a familiar stench that he could only describe as his own flooded through his nostrils and into his lungs.He scolded himself for not wearing enough deodorant as the kid introduced himself, "Name's John.You?"John could hear someone down front groan in response to this new insult to the sacred silence of the theater.John tried to formulate a response.Did he just tell the kid to fuck off?No, the kid might have the balls to make a scene of it and then John would be even deeper in the shit with these strangers.Better to play the game for a bit, maybe the kid would shut up when the movie started.What movie had his drunk-self been so desperate to see?The thought rolled through his mind as he tried his best to keep his volume down, "Your parents have good taste.Just like mine.Name's John."He stuck out his hand and the kid took it.Despite the teen's youth, he already seemed to have a bit of muscle on him.His grip was strong, and he seemed to want to show it as he went just a step into the uncomfortable with his squeeze."So, uh, kid.John.What movie is this?"The Kid lifted his shoulders and let them fall to form a shrug, "Our movie.Well, another rendition."John's brow curled into a frown that his lips sought to mimic, "The hell is that supposed to mean?"The kid leaned through the darkness and into the beam of empty light being spewed by the projector near the back, "You're dead, dude."John wanted to fight it.He wanted to tell the kid to shut up and just watch the movie, or to push himself out of the chair and barrel through the door into the outside, regardless of what the other patrons here might think.Yet, he knew that face.He could barely recognize himself, years of drinking and bad eating and sitting around undoing what little beauty nature had put upon him."How?"Young John shrugged."It makes no sense to most of us.I'm one of the oldest here and I still don't really get it.Nobody's come along to tell us what what's up.I haven't met an angel or a devil or a God.Just that big screen up there and repeatedly coming face to face with disappointment."John's temper flared as the last words tumbled out of his younger self's mouth.As he opened his own, the projector reel started to roll to life and the screen turned black."The hell do you mean, coming face to face with disappointment?"Young John was no longer looking at him.Instead, his eyes were locked on that inky blackness that stretched like an open maw before them."I died young.Drunk driver.Didn't get the chance that most of us here got.So imagine how it feels to watch yourself turn into what put you here."Another John in front of them turned and put his fingers to his lips, pushing a shush past them.Young John sneered at him, "Fuck off."John opened his mouth to fight the accusation, but as he tried to wrap his mind around it, his mind instead unwrapped around the hazy black memory that he had mistaken for a blacked out saunter into the movie theater.His heart fell into the pit of his stomach as lurid memories slipped into place of his fingers clenched tight around a steering wheel, the bulk of his car lurching left and right while he fumbled for a cigarette and his lighter, and the sudden stop as he and his car tied themselves into a neat little bow around a telephone pole."No.."   
   
"Yes."Young John was staring at him, but even in the darkness John could tell that he seemed almost sorry."So this is hell, then?We get to watch ourselves become what we hate?"Sound started to pump through the speakers.The sound of doctors and nurses and his own crying as a new John made his way into the world."It's not really hell-" Young John's reply was cut short when Another John turned in his seat and spit his venom at them, "Look, dipshits, its starting.Just watch the movie and keep your mouths shut.Some of us want to see what will happen."Young John pushed himself out of his chair and flipped his other self off, "Do you want to go?I remember your run, rotting away in your house, watching other people do what you wanted on the internet.You don't get to speak up now, dipshit."Another John pushed himself out of his chair, his frame chubbier than his peers, "You know I was disabled, jackass.I'll kick your ass even with a bum leg."The theater started to grow restless as the sound of his new infantile self's crying seemed to parody the ongoing dispute between the youth and adult.John was fairly sure he was right on the money with this being hell.Stepping up, he lifted his hands and motioned for both gentlemen to sit down, "Look, I'll stay quiet and watch the movie.Thanks for helping me out, uh, John.Maybe afterwards you could..you could..." His urge to speak faltered and the rest of the theater's occupants settled down immediately as a sound other than his own crying started to pump through the speakers.A woman's voice, unfamiliar yet more comforting than he had ever known, quelled the cries of the infant that he had barely been paying attention to.A wetness formed at the corner of his eyes as he turned to stare at the screen, a face he only recognized from pictures staring back at him with a pride he had never known someone could hold in their heart for him."Is that really her?"His breath caught in his throat as she started to sing him a lullaby, spreading a warmth through his body that he had been looking for all his wasted life.Young John nodded beside him, "This isn't hell.This is just another chance.You know, you only notice your fuck ups when looking back because you've got no reason to notice when you managed to get shit right.No reason to look into fixing what aint broke, right?I like to think the point is that once one of us gets it right, we all get to see it happen.Leave us with at least a little satisfaction and comfort despite what may have happened during our turn."John nodded and settled back down into his seat.Down front some of him openly wept.In his mind, in all their mind's, they wished that little cooing child the best of luck and thanked whatever forces that be that they finally got to see her, cancer be damned.
