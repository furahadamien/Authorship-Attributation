She smiles at the post, but a sadness lingers in the background.Although her holiday is good, there are others around her having a sad occasion.She closes her eyes, saying a silent prayer for those people.*On this Christmas Day, let those wth depression feel a spark of hope for life.Let those who are hungry fill their bellies as best they can.Let those who are shunned feel acceptance with whomever they can.Let those living in fear find a moment of peace.*

She opens her eyes, sending the prayer into the world.With a warm heart, she returns to her family and wishes the world a blessed holiday.
