I sigh and curl up beside where my Lady rests.The long day is nearly over, and the dark night is cold, but I only feel warmth beside my Lady, content that my path has not strayed all these years.I remember when my Lady first came for me, in the place where cats and dogs wait to be chosen.I had reached out to her - I was too young to know any better, the audacity to claim her mine - and my Lady turned around and brightened with delight.I despaired when she left, but she returned soon after with a basket lined with fleece, a home ready for me, promises of full meals and warm nights.Lady was always reaching out to me, as I had reached out to her.I leaped at her command so that my head will always reach her.I begged for more when she pet me, rubbed my belly, scratched my neck and ears, and tickled my paws.She forgave my scratches and bites, and so I bit less and patiently allowed her to trim my nails.I talked to her, even though she didn't understand me, and followed her, even as others called out to me, for I only had eyes and ears for Her."You're like *that dog*."Calesta hisses, "Not a proper cat."Duke, 'that dog', tells me the old puss has been around since before he was born.His own mother was midway through her own life when Calesta came into the family, and took her in as her own child.In time, his mother's day of passing came, and bitterness found Calesta."We are here for the Masters, as my mother was before me, and her father before her, all back to the First Masters and the First Guideposts that walked together from horizon to horizon."he tells me."Each generation passes on the mission to the next, which is to be their Guide for Love and Loyalty, and from this mission we will not stray until the Last Master walks with the Last Guidepost.Mother taught us that, but Calesta forgot because she only loved Mother, and her love died when Mother did.""Do you think I will forget?""Perhaps, if you are a cat like Calesta.Even the Masters pass on.""I don't want to forget.I love my Lady, she is the sun!"He chuckles."Even the sun sets, but the Lady's Passing Time is not even a shadow on the horizon.You will have many years to bask in her warmth and return it with love.Never leave her, Fidelity."___________________________________________

One day my Lady did not return home, the Old Masters said her Passing Time came sooner and suddenly.I grieved and wanted not food or water.Bitterness crept near like a diseased mouse, but I lacked the will to chase it away.Weeks after my sun had set, Calesta came to me."Come kitty-pup, it is time you left this home."I did not move, but Calesta pounced and scratched me, urging me to get up and follow.I followed, slowly.Calesta hissed that she could nap for hours at the pace we were going, and not move beyond her sight.I quickened, and she said no more.We passed many houses, a park, a place where young Masters learn how to be grown Masters, another park, more houses, the place where cats and dogs wait to be chosen, the place where the water birds live.Then, slipping between the bars of gates larger than I had ever seen, Calesta led me to a strange forest of stone.She stopped before one that looked like any other, but I sniffed, and knew without doubt that it was my Lady.My mission continued, as if it had never stopped.I never saw Calesta again, but one year after my Lady's Passing Time Duke came by with the Old Masters.They called, but I was steadfast in my vigil, and Duke understood.An elderly Master who tended to the forest brought me food and water at my Lady's stone, but he was not mine, and I was not his, and I think he too understood.My sun had set many years ago, and at last the final rays shall fade.I sigh and curl up beside where my Lady rests.The long day is nearly over, and the dark night is cold, but I only feel warmth beside my Lady, content that my path has not strayed all these years.
