I sat eating my dinner while flipping through the tv channels for something entertaining to watch.After skipping past the dozen or news reports as reporters discussed the looming threat of a N.Korea missile strike by an increasingly unhinged Kim Jong-un I found a college football game to pass some time.It was a 27-0 blow out still with 15 minutes to go in the game but at least it was better than listening to the same people regurgitate the same nonsense about how N Korea is a threat to us.By the time I had finished my dinner there was two minutes left in the game and the losing team had finally managed to score a couple times to close the score to 27-14.30 seconds later the crowd erupts on tv as the losing team scored again!I find myself transfixed with the possibility of one of the greatest comebacks in modern history playing out in front of my eyes.Commentator: "And West Virginia forced a fumble and has recovered the ball on their own 35 with 30 seconds remaining!Are we going to witness a miracle!"Just as the final play was starting....

Reporter: "We interrupt this program to bring you breaking news.Kim Jong-un has threatened..."

"Fuuuuuuck you!", I yelled as I turned the tv off and threw the remote across the room.Best game I've ever seen had the ending ruined by a bunch of pussy reporters scared of some nut job across the world that always makes threats.Ignore the idiot.Pissed off I decided to head to bed.I flipped my blanket over and was about to get in when I saw a house spider chilling on my pillow."Sneaky little bastard" I thought as I went to fetch a cup to put him in.I never was fond of killing indiscriminately and despite people complaining, "they'll find their way back in", I always put spiders outside.He was still in the same spot when I came back and i gently shooed him into the cup and the transported him outside.It was snowing pretty hard but I figured the spider would rather be wet and cold than squished and dead so i shook him out onto the ground and told him "today you, tomorrow me" as a mantra my grandmother taught me and headed back to bed.A month had passed since that night and here I was still ignoring the same nonsense on the news about N Korea and being bored with daily life.Eat, work, ignore, and sleep became my routine.As i laid back down in bed I wished, "I hope this shit ends.I'm tired of it already"

I woke with a start but not entirely sure why.I sat for a moment to let my eyes adjust to the dark and suddenly there was a flash of light.The night sky lit up as if it was day.It was painfully bright even through my curtains."What the fuck is that?!"I thought to myself.I stumbled quickly out of bed to take a peak outside, stubbing my toe and cursing along the way.As I pulled the curtain to the side to look outside... the window shattered into me and i was blown back across the room.A few moments later i awoke to the sound of car alarms blaring along the street.Dazed and confused, I mindlessly stumble across broken glass back toward the window and I see it.The unmistakable shape.A mushroom cloud in the distance."Jesus fucking christ", I thought, "the psycho actually did it" as panic began to fill me.I quickly grabbed my backpack and filled it with some clothes, food, a flashlight, and water and made a quick plan to get out of town.I went to the garage and stared at my car and motorcycle.I made a quick assessment and hurried to my motorcycle.Even as cold as it was outside I figured people would be trying to rush away as fast as possible and it would let me maneuver thru traffic better.I was right.People were in total panic.It was chaos.Several times i was nearly hit by scared shitless drivers just trying to flee.20 long minutes had passed and I was safely outside of town with no real plans on where I was heading.The mountain roads were covered in a thin sheet of ice, as they often are this time of year, and being in a hurry to leave I didn't dress as warmly as I should have.As I drive I fumble with my phone searching for news.The same news I had largely ignored over the past few weeks.I quickly found the news I was looking for on an emergency text.As I carelessly read the text my bike hit a patch of ice.I dropped my phone and put both hands on my handles as i tried to regain control.The bike wobbled and tipped me onto my side as I slid toward the guard rail.I lay on the ground looking up the side of a hill at the road I had been on."This night just keeps getting worse" ,  I thought as tried to stand, "but at least it seems my backpack absorbed a lot of the impact".I screamed in pain as my leg gave out."Shit!I guess it is broken!".I retrieved my flashlight and searched the area frantically and found a branch nearby to use as a crutch.There was no way I was getting back up that hill and the cold was starting to affect me.I needed shelter.To make matters worse it began to snow heavily.I limped for what seemed like hours through quickly building snow until I found a suitable place to hole up for the night.It was a cave.There was no telling if anything lived in there but I had no choice as there was already a foot of snow on the ground and was still increasing.I did a quick scan and aside from some spider webs and small rodent carcasses the cave was empty.I layered on the spare clothes I brought to try and keep warm and laid on the cave floor.My leg was throbbing with pain and I replayed the nights events in my mind.How could this have happened?In my thoughts i slowly drifted off to sleep when I felt something crawl across my face.I reflexively brushed it away and quickly pointed my flashlight in the area.And after a moment I saw it.A spider.I was too tired to stand and deal with it so i laid my head back down.Again, I felt something across my face.But this time there was more than one.I dropped my flashlight and tried to move to brush them off and felt a small sting on my hand, then my neck, and soon all over.It became increasingly hard to move and eventually I laid paralyzed as i felt the pitter patter of feet all over my body.I began to pray internally hoping my life wouldn't end this way...slowly fed on by countless little spiders."I had always been kind to spiders", I screamed, "This wasn't how karma should work!"After I moment I saw the flashlight begin to move away.No...I was moving away from the flashlight.It became apparent that somehow,what i could only assume is, thousands of spiders dragging me away.The horror of it enveloped me.After a few moments I had been drug to the cave entrance.The spiders placed me just outside lying in what was now several feet of snow and the wind and cold.I laid paralyzed and freezing as I drifted off thinking...."it was better to be wet and cold than squished and dead".This was my karma."today you, tomorrow me" I whispered with my last breath.
