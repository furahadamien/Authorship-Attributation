Under the weather has been a understatement.It was a cold blistering winter.Of course I caught the cold.When I was younger, I would remember how crazed my grandmother was when I would get sick.She was such a sweet soul.I always enjoyed her cooking and it always made me feel better.Its been a while now though and early in the year me and my parents were going through some of the things she left behind after she passed.I was reluctant to find a big cook book.A big solid book.It was hand crafted.The book was full of tasty recipes.I took it upon myself to take it home and learn her cooking secrets.I found the chicken soup recipe, oh how I loved the way she made it for me when I was sick.The whole book was hand written.I traced the letters and made a list.I was able to get all the ingredients at the local market.Today was going to be the day Id get a taste of the past.I only hoped that I could make it like she did but I was confident.I started the pot and started cutting up the vegetables.I followed the instructions word for word.Near the end I saw a weird series of words.It was a chant.I whispered them and laughed at myself.No way that she would do this!After the last ingredient was placed in the bowl I was to let it simmer for 30 mins.I left the room and left to my living room.I waited patently.I heard a boom!I rushed to the kitchen.It was cloudy.I thought it caught fire and I was flustered.This smoke wasnt like any smoke though.The bowl lid was on the floor.I watched intensely as something was coming out.I looked as a figure rose from the bowl.It was a dark figure and it was looking into my soul.I gasped for air.I wanted to run by I was frozen with fear.The figure came slowly to me and asked me where my grandmother was calling her by her full name.I muttered out nonsense.I ran to the book to try and figure things out.How could this be.I must be dreaming.He demanded to know what I wanted and why I summoned him.I decided to run for the door with the book in my hands.I closed the door...I would now need to figure things out fast.What was happening ?How could chicken soup do this?!What did those Danm words mean?What was my grandmother into?
