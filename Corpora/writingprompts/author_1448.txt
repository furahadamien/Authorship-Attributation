For one last time, before the end of the epoch jesus came down from his abode and told the world these wise words from a high rock above the basin, With his hands pointed to the sky he said, "My creation, my love, my children, you have two sons amongst you that have kept themselves hidden from you for to long."Down below at the basin Brad and Chad were busy attending to the seasons last harvest.Brad was hard at work sweating from his eyebrows and his arms, he then noticed the sky turn darker, it seemed that a storm was looming over the horizon."Hey Chad do you see that storm over there?it looks like its coming our way."Chad to looked towards where the clouds were forming and thought the same. "Yep looks like dads getting angry again."Then from the clouds a lightening bolt came down striking the poppy field pushing the boys into the air and creating a huge fierey outline the shape of a circle, when the smoke cleared brad and chad saw that it was Jesus who came down from the heavens.The boys were mystified to see dad, they got up and rushed to hung him . "My boys, my boys, dont be scared of this years harvest because you and your families will have more then enough to eat this year."And then jesus pulled out a fat blunt and lit it up.
