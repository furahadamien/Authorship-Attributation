TheStomatopoda
Not sure if you're aware, but there is a (very good) web fiction series called  that focuses heavily on the idea of a 'competent villain', to the point the entire world is built on the idea of semi-philosophical following and manipulation of tropes.Significant characters playing 'heroic' or 'villainous' roles even face having to resist slowly becoming influenced and controlled by 'fate', lest they become the stereotypical caricatures of past stories unable to control their predetermined future.
