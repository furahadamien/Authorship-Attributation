"DAD!"I shouted, as I slammed the front door to the house behind me.I was in a state of near panic, frantically trying to take my dress shoes off, as I shouted for him again, "DAD!"I heard noise from the living room, the springs of my Dad's favourite chair protesting like they always did, from age and use, as he stood and called back, "Trent?What's the matter?"Relief washed over me at the sound of his voice, and I managed to finish ripping off my shoes.Unable to form any words, I simply rushed down the short hallway, to where he was coming into the other end, and threw my arms around him.The weight of my rail-thin 13-year-old frame barely moved him, and after a split-second of surprise, he wrapped his arms around me.Dad was the only one I could talk to about this.He was the only one who knew about my power, the only one I dared trust.Despite being dripping with sweat, I was shivering, but after a couple of moments in the comfort of my father's arms, I was able to draw a ragged, deep breath and center myself.I eased off the death-grip I had around my Dad's ribs, and backed up a half-step.He moved his hands to my shoulders as I backed away, looking worriedly at my face."What's going on buddy?"He asked."I... ju... th...," I stumbled over my words, and took another calming breath."I was working at the dance, for the golf club, like we had talked about, as the entry-man."The school loved their 'clubs', and loved using them for 'volunteers' for events like this.I honestly hadn't minded this one.It was far better than the Halloween clean-up crew 'volunteers', or the 'stack 200 chairs the morning after a meeting in the gym' jobs.I had even joked with Dad about this being good 'bouncer' training for when I was older.I'd make a perfect bouncer, you see, because of my gift.I can read people's age, can see it just over people's heads, almost like a digital clock.I learned young not to talk about it, learned that it wasn't 'normal', but I was fine with that.Only 3 people in the world have ever known about it.Myself, Dad, and Mom while she was still alive.Dad nodded for me to continue, as I searched for the right words, "We were set up at a table by the fire exit to the gym.I was checking school IDs, and Nick was stamping hands, and it was really cool, and it was a good time.Most of the kids from the school were already inside when Vincent Holst showed up with Daisy Redden."Daisy Redden was *the* hottest, smartest, most sought-after girl in our Junior High.I had a crush on her, and my dad knew that, but *everyone* had a crush on her.The Holst family was fairly enigmatic in our town.Vincent, like his parents, didn't socialize much.I had paused for a second as the memory of their arrival came back to me, fresh again.Dad prompted me, "Is that what has you upset, Trent?A date?"I shook my head, freeing myself of the image, and refocused on my Dad's face, "Wha..?No, no, not that at all.Dad, Vincent was dropped off by his parents.They came over to the table to pay for the entry fee.That.... that's when I saw their numbers."I began to shake again slightly."Why does that have you so worked up?"I tried to keep a steady voice, but it cracked and broke as my throat ran dry, "Because his Dad's number was Eight Hundred Ninety-two, and his Mom's was.... was... One thousand Two Hun..Hundred and Forty-Fi..Forty-Five."I'm not sure entirely what convinced him of my sincerity that night, but he stood there and just looked at me for a while before he spoke."Pack a bag."
