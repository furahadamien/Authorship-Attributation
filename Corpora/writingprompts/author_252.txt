Waking up it felt as if i was on fire, like electricity was burning my soul away.Piece by piece it was being ripped away in time with the rhythm of my heart.As soon as i felt that i could not go on something resonated with my mind.All of a sudden that burning was replaced with a tempered heat as if my soul itself was being reborn within those fires.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

As i laid there for the next couple minutes it felt as my body was rebooting itself, my senses slowly turning back on.The first thing i noticed was the smell of smoke all around me.Struggling at first, i pushed myself off the ground to try to find the source of the smell.Walking closer to my front door the smell increased in intensity as i neared.As I opened the door i felt a rush of hot air to meet me.Outside the embers of the world that i once knew danced upon the wind like the stars in the skies.The city i had grown up in was on fire, blazing like the gods themselves dropped hell fire upon the world.Suddenly there was a massive explosion and i felt a new way of heat as i was forced to close my eyes against the light.As i the light subsided i traced the sound to the rend that part of the city once occupied.Looking up from the destruction my heart stop, on the horizon a colossus of a ship had teardrops falling on to the ground that the city once laid.Ice filled within my gut as i gazed upon the damage that the ship had brought.Dread gripping my heart i could only think of one thing, escape.------------------------------
After that night i began to question myself, what right do i have to live with all those that surely were lost within the eradication of the city.Why was i still alive while all those people were dead.After a few more days i began to hears whispers as the tempered heat came back to me filling me with someone.I did not know what was happening but those whispers started to cooing me into comfort.They whispered that what happened to those in the city was not my fault and that nothing i could've done could've changed what took place there.This soothed my worries some but i kept feeling i there was something that i had to do.---------------------------------------
A week later i was stopping at a river to drink, i do not know which one anymore as i had lost all form of direction due to my hunger which was a constant pain for me.After finishing i sat on the river bank staring into the water.This was becoming increasing common  lately.I do not know if it was the lack of food or the shock of destructed all those days ago but as i stared into those waters the whispers that had been my constant companion began to grow louder and louder.With there musings i began to lose myself in their words, drifting in and out of myself.As i regained myself i felt a cool blanket wrapped around myself.As if nature itself embraced me the sight around me breathtaking.Lilies sprouted around a red maple tree that wrapped around me as if to comfort me.The whispers did not silence as they once did before.Now they murmur in a chorus that clearly rang through me.The warmth that  always felt now began to bubble as they spoke."Through our sacrifice you preserve us."With that the heat within me began to rapidly cool within me, hardening into steel.I knew what i must do in that moment.Without though i heard the words "Retentat ligni vitae, e pluribus unum" come to my mouth.With that i took off, back to the ruined city.
