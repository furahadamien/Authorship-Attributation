"Fate.""Fate?""Yes, Gilgamesh, you've been here about as long as anyone, and you've seen it's a fairly stable place...I mean it's not, but there are clear patterns... People leave this "place" after the last time their name is ever said.""Ok, but how does that prove people have fates... That everything has a fate?Only one possible mode of existence ever.""Whatever force or god or gods controls people leaving at the moment of their last name-mention must *know* that no future occurrences exist, hence our ultimate future and really the future of everything is known... And to be know is to be determined, hence, fate.""But wait... You don't believe in fate or god, and really the concept doesn't make sense.That shouldn't be confused with physical determinism, which is true but doesn't negate morality somehow.""That's a weird sentence Gilgamesh, but actually you're right.""Wait, so why are we in purgatory then?"We're not, I'm right here and you're right there, sharing this experience.This shared experience isn't a really a person, place, "place", or thing...It *is* purgatory... That etherial something yet nothing thread that connects two people possibly halfway across the world or thousands of years in the future, as you read these words.Or, never."Whatever, Hitler, you're the worst."
