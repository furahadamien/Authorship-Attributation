As a Parent I was supposed to be bothered by this -but nah- I mean it is a fucking fire breathing horse on my lawn.It just felt Awesome.A flaming mustang.It just stood there looking majestic, way more majestic than dragons in a King Author movie.Where its pupil were supposed be was a complete white spot, making its eyes a complete white.I looked into this eyes and suddenly I was arrested by it and all my dark secrets started to crawl out of my body and pull me into myself.I struggled for a while and finally managed to tear my eyes away from it.Damn.As if in response to my surprise it snorted in awesomeness and fire spewed out the sides of its mouth.Its tail swished slowly but I could feel the wind change direction in response to it.The power it must pack in that tail.Well luckily I was one of those work at home dad in a suburban neighborhood all my neighbors had locked up and gone to work, but still I have to get it off my lawn and into the garage then figure out what in devils name was happening.I took my first steps towards the horse, avoiding its deep gaze, it made no moves.On getting closer I saw a note hanging on a chain of smoke hooked around its neck.I made to grab the note.The horse growled.Immediately I withdrew my hand and stepped back.Horses don't growl what the fuck is this 
The comic books fan boy in me was blushing in delight.I was going to hide this from the government and probably fight crime at night but after I get the horse to obey me first.I tried again.It growled and bared teeth, no fangs -definitely saw some fangs there- this time.I scratched my head thinking of a next move.Like how do you tame a fire breathing mustang, is that shit on Google?The window upstairs opened and a voice shouted
"He kept his word" 
It was my 6 year old daughter.She squealed In delight and started running downstairs.First she asks me for a pony and now this?, maybe she could shed some light on fire breather here.The door opened."Oh dad he delivered" she hugged me I picked her up."Who delivered honey"
"Barney" 
Barney, huh, that doesn't make sense.She came down from my hands and walked towards the horse.It suddenly seemed happy to see her, like it was made for her, then I noticed the sky blue color of its body and the white of its mane were my two favorite colors.This was like something out of a fantasy, maybe a dream.I pinched myself.Ouch.Not a dream. 
"okay dear how'd you talk with Barney " 
"He came to me dad"
"When and where"
"This morning in my dreams"
Damn Barney delivery service seemed better than Amazon.Leila didn't understand why her dad was quizzing her she had gotten what she asked for from Barney, shouldn't he be happy and take her and grimnir out for ice cream.-Yes Grimnir was the name.It had whispered it to her as their eyes met .- instead he wanted to know how she met Barney well she was going to tell him and maybe then they'd go get ice cream.She talked."After you said I couldn't get a pony, I talked to God and got no reply, and then the homeless man who always hangs out in front of school told me he could get me a horse.I asked how and he gave me a paper and said I should draw the diagram on it-
" wait a what?""And how did he know" I interrupted her."Iono" she replied and then continued."After drawing the diagram he said I should sit in the middle and open my mind crying out my desire and it shall be answered it was around this time Barney came" 
Okay this smelled of some Satan fuckery, by now she and the horse were close enough to me I looked into her eyes, maybe I should get her a bowl of ice cream.Leila smiled, she could sense her dads thoughts now and she had seen a bowl of ice cream in them.Her dad reached out for the note on grimnir neck, she told grimnir to let him have it, they had a connection so he listened to her heart.She felt like a bad ass Dora with a fire breather horse.She was going to explore the world and burn up all the bullies while she was at it.She watched her dad read the note and then his expression changed."Noooo fuck nooo" I screamed 
It couldn't be, my daughter lost her soul to the devil for a freaking horse, okay it's fire breathing but still."Lei what did Barney say when he came to you" 
"He said he could get me my pony for a small price" she said with a smile
"I don't know what a soul is but it seemed like a good deal so I took it" 
Fuck no Fuck no.I am an atheist dad and her mom died during child birth.This talk of souls didn't make sense to me but this horse was real and that fact argued that a soul must be too, since according to the note my daughter lost hers for a horse from hell."Dear" I said."This homeless dude hangs out in front of your school right?"She nodded in response as she played with her horses mane.A few cars drove by breaking the silence of the Street nothing to worry about from behind it just looked like a normal horse.I needed to go find this homeless dude.I needed to get my daughters soul back from the devil and this homeless person might have some answers.I clenched my fist.I was going to beat the devil to death.He appeared to my daughter in the form of Barney to steal her soul, for such a shitty move he deserved to die.I don't know how I'm going to do it.Maybe consult lots of religious books on how to kill a devil but I was going to do it."Lei take the horse to the garage and wait for daddy I'll be back soon" 
"Don't forget the ice cream" 
"Oh I wouldn't dear" 
Leila led the horse to the garage , she could sense danger and anger in her dad's thoughts so she was going to follow his mind with hers.She set up a permanent link to his mind not knowing that the next time she saw him would be in hell.Her dad got in the car and drove away in search of the homeless dude.
