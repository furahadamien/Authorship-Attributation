Neon lights buzzed like a plague of locusts on the empty street.The smoke from my cigarette joined the steam from the vents along the sidewalk.My hand shook as I took another drag.It always shook after a kill.I've been doing this a long time.I could tell you I think it's necessary, or right, or even just.I could tell you whatever I wanted if I cared to justify myself.If I cared to justify myself, I wouldn't be who I am.They've given me a name, not something I care to acknowledge.They have a 5 year old, fuzzy description of me.Nothing near accurate enough to ever pin me down.They call me the "King of Evil".I know, ridiculous.This city has always had crime.Small time shoplifters, street gangs, various organized crime organizations, even a few "supervillains", guys who were effective at what they did and rose to the top.Where you have vermin like the people who live here packed in like so much shit in a tin can there's bound to be corruption and disease.It's human nature, and ultimately, it's why I do what I do.Where you have an audience, you have performers."Heroes."Plenty of these jokers have what they call super powers, abilities that allow them to perform superhuman feats.Strength, telekinesis, flight, that kind of thing.The thing about both heroes and villains is that they have egos big enough to choke a city.They're both vampires, and one isn't necessarily worse than the other to me.I've killed both.I've killed a lot more heroes, though.They haven't learned to leave me alone like the villains have.Villains know I'm bad for business.Heroes are performers, and they want all the laurels.The weakness all of these charlatans have in common is that they want this compost heap of a city to know their names.Their screen names, anyway.With their constant fighting, it's easy to learn their weaknesses.For most of them it's as simple as a gun.Tonight was something special for me, though.No guns.No hard to acquire materials, no need to learn complex patterns or languages.Tonight I got to strangle a man to death.A man who has been the most offensive of all for as long as I can remember.When investigators find his hard drives the truth will come out, and maybe a few more of these two legged rats will start seeing above the muck and realize we're all kings and glorifying these jesters and sharks is below us.
