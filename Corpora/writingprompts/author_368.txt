**Hello Barack.**

President Kennedy?Is it really you?**Er, ah...**

Yep, that's your catch phrase.Nice to meet you.**Thanks, Obama.(laughs) I've been waiting for almost nine years to say that.**

But I thought you were dead all these years.And you look *exactly* the same as you did the day you were shot.How in the heck did that happen?**Long story.Anyways, we got some work to do.**

Ok.I always admired your sense of service to the community.I tried to emulate your leadership and warmth, how you called for us to come together and strive to be a better nation.You served your country on the battlefield and in the halls of our nation's capitol.As long as we continue to move forward with hope, we honor your courage and vision.**Good.Welcome to my punk rock music venue.**

I'm sorry?**I spent the past 53 years being immortal and running the hottest punk club in DC.What, you were president for eight whole years and never heard of Oswald's Bar?It's where Fugazi played their first show.Best pit I've ever been in.Afterwards, Ian McKaye came up and introduced himself.We hit it off immediately.We still have a secret handshake to this day, one we made up that night.**

Sorry, I'm unfamiliar.**Well, you're here now and you work for me.**

I beg your pardon?**You're the new sound guy.**

Sir (chuckles) with all due respect, I'm a two term president with a family, a foundation, speaking gigs in the six figure range...I'm afraid I can't work at some music venue.**Too late.Doors are about to open.The bands can load in through that door.Line check before each band, door split three ways after we take out $150, that's your cut.The Smear Campaign headlines, you've got Ian & The Beans before then, and before THAT it's The Fob Knobs.Somebody's cousins band is probably gonna open.Won't matter who.They'll play to three people and keep asking you for more vocals in the monitor.Also, don't pay the drummer.NEVER pay the drummer.Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a trophy to win at the sports arena.(zooms off on skateboard)**

God, I miss that man.(wipes away tear) Well, this won't be so bad.I mean, sure, the presidency was great but I can run the board, drink some beers, hang out with people not named Biden... Oh, God.Wait, that can't be... Oh, no he's coming towards me.*Hey, Barry!*

Hello, Joe.*Dude, I didn't know you came here too.You meet JFK?*

You knew?*You never figured it out?Ha!Who knew the POTUS was really just a poser.He was the other bass player for Nation of Ulysses, too.*

Listen, I'd love to chat, but I have to do sound for this band.*It's like we're back in the White House!I'm getting the warm fuzzies.Anyhow, I gotta boogie but I'll be back for the headliner.Put me on the guest list!(zooms away on hoverboard)*

Ok. Bye, Joe.(sighs, chuckles, starts setting up microphones on stage as "Blitzkrieg Bop" by The Ramones begins playing and the picture fades to black)
