I am slowly filling out the forms the bank clerk handed when suddenly six guys in balaclavas burst in an announce a holdup.They start holding people in small groups, waving their guns around.One of them made a contact with me, his eyes opened wide, his gun aimed at me, i stared him down, now all of them looked at me, and slowly backed away like a pack of raptors when challenged by a T-rex.I caught a whiff of something, a scent, females robbing the bank?The leader kept her gun pointed at me, while the other stuff their bags with cash, a confused look evident in her eyes.Those eyes seem familiar, like i had looked at them many times before.One of the robbers grabbed her by the shoulder and said let's go then looked at me while running out of bank door.And in an instant, gone.All that work casing out this bank ruined.My phone buzzed and i opened a message."You shouldn't have come here Frank.I can't promise to keep you safe forever."The number's unlisted and probably be burnt, but i know who it is.
