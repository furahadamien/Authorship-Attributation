"I don't read fiction," my girl said in a fit of cynicism."But it's not," I tried to explain."It's the author's memoir.The things he describes are recollections he actually experienced.""I'm not buying it.What he describes sounds unbelievable."She had quite the point, but, then again, believable events make the most boring of stories."The author might have embellished it for the sake of entertainment, but it should very much be based on true event."She shook her head, but indulged me with irony.She asked what it was about, and I told her.She wouldn't have any of it."I don't believe in love."
