To the Minister for Magic, 

The following text is from Ms. Miller's journal.The entrances have been edited and time-stamped for the purpose of legibility and understanding.The original text will be presented along with Miller's acceptance letter during the trial date.Please have reviewed the copies before then.(31st of August, 2017) 

It's late at night but I can't sleep!I'm so excited about tomorrow, but I'm also scared.I'm probably one of the only students who won't have their stuff yet, and what if Hagrid's busy now that he's a professor again?And what if there are kids like Draco there that bully me for not having anything?Tomorrow's supposed to be the first day Albus Severus starts school, so I might meet Harry Potter without a quill and ink for an autograph!I told mum I wanted to start using quill and ink before the year started so I'd be ready but she told me I wouldn't have to worry about it.She said it'll come as naturally as magic.She tried to give me a fake wand but I knew it wasn't real!She said I was smart for knowing the difference and that it would just be for the pictures before I board the train, and none of the other wizards would see because it would be outside the station.She said she has to stay outside the station because she's a muggle.I feel bad for her but I can't wait to make her proud!Can I get a new journal in Hogsmeade too?Did mum send in enough money for extra stuff?I need a new journal too, because I know there'll be much cooler stuff than seeing owls in the day to write about!But mum said I won't want to write anymore after I see the real wizarding world.Not true!I want to show her everything that happens so she can be a part of the magic too!I already can't wait until I'm older so I can show her the spells I learn!Maybe I can do potions over the summer.I finally feel tired.I think I'll sleep 

 

(1st of September, 2017) 

I didn't get a lot of sleep but I'm not tired.Mum made me my favorite breakfast!She mentioned my favorite dinner too and I got confused, but then she explained she meant at Hogwarts and she got all red in the face.If she's upset the food there will be better than hers, she has nothing to worry about!Not even magic can beat her food!She told me I should stop writing because I'd be upset about it later and didn't explain why.I think she thinks I'm like Colin Creevey, but he actually turned out to be cool!And look at Luna!I want to be like them!We leave in about twenty minutes, I've been watching my favorite Disney movie before we go since I won't get to see anything else until Christmas break.I wanted to watch the Harry Potter movies so I could remember the important information like potion ingredients and what families to watch out for, but mum told me I wouldn't want to see them because it'd be weird to know so much when I go.She got all red in the face again, I'm not like Colin, mum!But Emma Watson is in this movie so I'm happy because I still see Hermione, but it makes me wonder what the real Hermione will look like!Won't her and Ron be there too?I forgot Ginny will be with Harry!I'm so excited to meet all of them!We're riding there now!My handwriting's so messy because of the bumpiness.Mum's yelling at a car.I just remembered we're supposed to put on our uniforms when we get to Hogwarts and now I'm worried I'll be the only kid not wearing one.The only things I really have are a cloak (which is really cool looking!!!)and my letter, and I feel weird about taking it with me but mum wants it for the picture too.I'm starting to feel a little tired.It's a long ride.(On the train) 

I MET HARRY POTTER!!!And Ron, and Hermione, and Ginny, and I think I saw Draco!I didn't get an autograph because we had to get on train, but I'm still so happy!And now I'm sitting with a Hufflepuff!He said he knows he's going to be one because his whole family has been Hufflepuff, and he told me not to worry about not knowing because each house is amazing!I like him, I think his name's Dean, but he's not related to Dean Thomas, but he did know who Dean Thomas is and said his mother knew him too!He got chocolate frogs and gave me one because I only had muggle money, it's like Harry and Ron.Maybe we'll end up on adventures together!I'm going to try to sleep again because it's weird being the only one awake in the compartment (there's another kid here that just read some book until they passed out) and I don't want to be exhausted when we get there.(Presumably during Sorting Ceremony) 

I'm writing this while standing but note: Karl Jenkins is a jerk!Also I should have had my uniform!(Post Ceremony) 

I think I'm special like Harry and Albus.My name got lost or something and it caused and uproar.Headmistress McGonagall said she knows my name was written in the book of students accepted into Hogwarts but that nothing ever indicated I agreed to attend because she didn't receive an owl by July 30-something.I can't see them messing up but I know mum didn't mess up either because she showed me the letter and said she sent her acceptance letter back on the owl it came from immediately.So what happened?I wasn't sorted because of it and McGonagall has me staying where there's an extra bed in the Gryffindor girls' dorm.I'm happy to be put with them but I think it's just because she has the most control over Gryffindors, and now everyone's been looking at me but nobody's said anything!I'm exhausted so I'll sleep for now but I'm worried.(2nd of September, 2017.Morning) 

I was taken up to Headmistress McGonagall's office and asked a lot of questions.I told them mum sent the acceptance letter in and that I was supposed to get my stuff after everyone else because she didn't know the way to Diagon Alley.McGonagall told me there were multiple ways to get me there and said something seems "suspicious."She asked if I want to attend Hogwarts and I told her with all of my heart.She smiled and said she thinks I'd be great in Gryffindor!(Mid-day) 

McGonagall seemed less happy when she saw me this time and she had an auror there (I wish it'd been Harry) that asked me more questions.He said my mum was found going off on people at the station after the platform had closed and they don't know if it's safe to get into contact with her.I don't think she could have been 'going off' on anyone like he said, but I told him she probably was just really upset to see me go because it'll be the first time we've really been apart.He didn't seem so sure.I've been waiting in the Gryffindor tower all day just walking around and reading some of the books left by the fireplace.There's a sign that says "Looking for potion maker for blood-coughing" that's really torn on the top, a prefect came by and got really angry when he removed it and asked if I saw who put it up so I think that's why it's torn.Why not just throw it out?He also asked me if I know what's going on (after he got over the sign) and explained he meant about me.I told him what I could and then other kids that came by between classes.They're really interested, so I think I might just be able to use this to be well-known.The only more popular topic is Albus Severus being Slytherin, and one girl asked if I was somehow related!(After mother was located and interrogated) 

I was pulled back into Professor McGonagall's office again (I've decided to call her professor because I still see her as that from the books) and she told me they spoke with my mum.They seemed really confused because they said that she said that she doesn't know what's going on and just wants me back.The auror guy told me she said she thought the acceptance letter she gave me was sent by her friend that was in on what he called "the joke" and that she thought her friend just put it near the fireplace to be extra funny.I think he means Ms. Jones because she's the only one that has keys to the house to do something like that and she's with mum a lot.I don't like the auror guy, accusing mum like that.She must have been obliviated because she knew the letter was important!And Ms. Jones would never fake the letter to mess with mum either, and McGonagall even said it was the real one!I showed it to her and she touched it and it did something weird so it's obviously magical!And it's never crumpled!(After student interrogation) 

They said mum didn't know any of this was real and was just trying to encourage me based on the books Rowling published, and now she's terrified and wants me sent home.They said they don't know what to do and that a trial may have to be held to find my mum's intentions and whether I can attend Hogwarts so I'll get a date for the trial and be sent home for a while until then and then they'll come and get me, and the auror guy told me to let mum know that I will have to attend the trial and they will get me there by any means.My mum isn't Petunia!I don't like him at all!They also said they'd have to take my journal to use as evidence so whoever's reading this, my mum didn't lie to me!If this is the auror guy, you're a jerk!And if this is Hermione, hi!And congratulations on becoming the Minister!If Umbridge is still around and sees this, just know you're a [text removed.]
