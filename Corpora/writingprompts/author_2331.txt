The small child stood before her with his twig-like arms outstretched, grasping the large gold cup of water.She watched as condensation beaded on the  cups lip and ran down the sides.She couldn't stop the involuntary dry swallow that followed.The thirst gnawed at her like a rat trapped in a fleshy prison.She shifted her gaze to the boy and saw a shudder run through him.He started to shuffle back but she held out her hands to him, beckoning for the cup.He's face relaxed and he slid  closer, stretching out as far as he could, trying not to touch her.The boy tripped.She watched the scene in slow motion, the boy falling forward, terror racing over his face.The cup falling from his grasp and the precious water leaving the cup in a single sheet to splash on the floor at her feet.The sound of the cup echoed off of the walls of the stone chamber as it rolled to the side, empty and useless.The boy lay still.Paralyzed with fear.She could smell the terror sweat and a more pungent oder she chose to ignore.She took a step to him and kneeling, gently pulled him up and to her in a hug.Making the small noises a concerned mother would make over a fallen child.She could feel the slow sobs start and stroked his long hair.Slowly she pushed it aside to reveal his neck and he whimpered as her lips made contact with the hot, dry skin.She could feel the fast pulse of the terrified child as she sank her teeth into the soft flesh.The metallic Taste of his warm blood filled her mouth and she swallowed as much as she could before the child went limp in her arms.She let the small lifeless body fall to the floor as she stood and wiped at her mouth.Her sleeve came away covered in the boys blood and she had to resist the urge to suck at it to draw the last few drops from the worn cloth.She turned to gaze at the golden cup, knowing that it had held death for her, happy that she had avoided the darkness that it's clear, cool contents would bring.She knew that they would send another to her tomorrow, the small, ragged children from the street, hoping that she would choose the cup.Maybe she would one day, but why should she stop now, when the blood had sustained her for centuries.She could not help but smile as she turned back to her rooms and the enormous pile of books waiting there.She gave a chuckle as she remembered a curious saying from her youth, "so many books, so little time."she said almost in a whisper.
