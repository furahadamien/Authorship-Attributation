A Distinguished physicist named Sergi Yuzebabenko crated a small wormhole like portal that may possibly lead to an alternate universe.Earth December 5, 2078 

Sergi successfully crated a portal to an alternate universe, drones were sent through to investigate the alternate universe.Preliminary readings indicate a total lack of volcanic or geological activity, the planet seems to be made of scattered small lakes and huge plains covered with tall grass.Earth December 10, 2078 

Sergi's project was confiscated by the UN, in exchange for his continued work in the project he was allowed to lead the project but under the supervision of General Davis.Earth December 12, 2078

A drone had been damaged, last images sent back seem to indicate it was shot down by a strange energy source.The "plains planet" was officially declared hostile and a permanent UN peace keeping presence was stationed at the lab.Earth December 20, 2078

General Davis orders a squad of spec ops personnel lead a recon mission and establish a forward operating base as soil samples from the plains planet indicated that the soil is 100 times more fertile than any soil found on earth.Earth January 5, 2079

A team consisting of over 300 hundred Seals, Green berets and Spetsnaz was sent through the portal to establish a forward operating base.Approximately 5 hours after the team, now designated alpha team, they encountered a small group of humans that seemed to be primitive in technology, it was discovered that they were the group that had shot down the drone.After some contact it was discovered that they spoke Latin.Earth January 6, 2079

Alpha team establishes a small base.Light jeeps were sent through the portal and were retrieved by alpha team.At the request of the Russian contingent, several M2 Abrams and T1009 tanks were also sent.100 scientists, including biologists, physicists, ecologists and doctors were sent through along with 300 UN   regular infantry.Earth January 9, 2079

Doctors examine the native inhabitants of the natives of the plains world and to their surprise find they are resistant to all diseases that they encountered from the initial expedition.A purple fluid was discovered in the natives blood, it has been dubbed ether.Earth January 13, 2079 

News of the alternate world was annoyed to the general public.A new UN board was created to govern how to handle relations with the natives of the plains world

Earth January 29, 2079

Drones find a large city on the plains world.It is inhabited by over 3 million natives.Earth February 4, 2079

Several more native cities are found in the plains world.It is discovered that the natives lack the ability to create fire,
the natives seem to "cook" their food with the ether.Earth February 9, 2079 

Several physicists come to the conclusion that the ether follows no known laws of physics.The natives seem to harness it with their mental abilities alone.Plains world February 18, 2079

A crop of corn was successfully grown to maturation, 900 UN regulars were sent from earth to fortify the base and expand the defense capabilities, an air strip was constructed and 5 Z-9 attack jets were received.300 more scientists arrive along with a UN envoy

Plains world February 21, 2079

Envoy attempted to make contact with a native city, natives fired upon the envoy guards and personnel, only 3 survivors made it back to base

Plains world February 23, 2079 

General Davis along with 10000 regular UN infantry arrive from earth, the UN has decided that the opportunity to harness the plains world can not be lost, as almost all soil on earth has been poisoned by pollution.Plains world February 24, 2079 

Several more attack vehicles arrive from earth.Construction of walls around the base begins.Plains world  March 3, 2079

Walls construction is completed 

Plains world March 10, 2019

600 framers arrived from earth along with several tons of corn, watermelon and strawberry seed.Plains world March 11, 2079 

Civilian population quarters are constructed 

Plains world March 12, 2079


Farming begins


Plains world March 21, 2079


A large population of natives were detected with a direct heading for the base, several artillery batteries are recived from earth on priority.They were  ready to fire within hours of arrival

Plains world March 25, 2079

The large native force consists of 15000 males who seems to be armed with ether enabled weapons, their leader meets with general Davis, he remarks "they want us to leave and never come back, let's show them what we are made of" 

Plains world March 26, 2079

The native army is within 2 km of the base, general Davis informs the native  leader that he has no intention of withdrawing


Plains world March 27, 2079 

The native army attacks the base, artilley and aerial bombardment wipe out most of the attacking force before  they arrive at the base, fires spread throughout the grass fields and what was left of the natives forces burn alive 

Plains world April 9, 2079 


General Davis travels to he largest native city along with 6000 men and several attack vehicles to demand complete capitulation, the natives agree 


Plains world April 12, 2079 


The plains world is officially declared a territory of the United Nations of earth, the natives are allowed to Live on 1/2 of the planet as long as they agree to give up their ether weaponry, they agree
