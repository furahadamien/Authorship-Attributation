Ray sat at the bar drinking his fifth beer."Larry, I know everyone is talking about the whole mug thing, but honestly, I think it's all a bunch of shit!"he said to the bartender."Ray, every single dad in the world got a mug with a number and the word 'Dad' on it.Even the one's that never had a '#1 Dad' mug had one of their other mugs change into a Dad ranking mug.Why are you sure that it's all fake?"asked Larry."Because I had one of my mugs change into one of those, and mine said '#1 Dad'.We both know I don't have any kids, and even if I did, there is no way I could have taken good enough care of that kid to be ranked #1.Therefore, it's all gotta be bullshit."replied Ray.Dubiously, Larry looked at Ray, and finally shrugged."Ok, Ray, if you say so."Shaking his head at Larry's naivete, Ray looked around the establishment."Say, where's Cherry?I want to have my usual VIP dance.""Ahh, Cherry doesn't work here anymore.She apparently finished her master's degree and started her own company.Seeing as you're her most frequent customer, you pretty much put her through school and paid for all her....."  Larry stopped talking eyes wide, and mouth agape...
