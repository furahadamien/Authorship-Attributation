"Don't worry about it, honey," my wife consoled me."A pony just isn't realistic.""I know that, but she doesn't.I just don't want to see our daughter crying on Christmas," I said as I climbed into bed and pulled the string to turn off the bedside lamp."She'll understand."I hoped she would.Last year we got her a puppy and made her the happiest girl in the neighborhood.But she can't have everything she wants.She'll understand.--

*"Daddy!Daddy!"*, my daughter screamed, jumping and pulling on the covers of our bed.I squinted my eyes open.The clock next to the bed said 7:06 AM."What is it, baby?", my wife asked groggily.*"Pony!Pony!The front yard!"* My eyes shot open.I got out of bed and rushed down the flight of stairs to the front door.I twisted the brass lock and flung the wooden frame open.In the middle of our front walk was a horse with a crimson red coat and fire flowing from his nostrils with every exhale.It was tied to a stake on the right side of the lawn.The yard was covered with a light blanket of snow save for a patch of burnt grass where the horse was breathing onto.My daughter ran and jumped towards the hellish beast and hugged its front right leg with unadulterated excitement.*"Can I name him, daddy?"*, she asked eagerly.I had no response.I looked down by my feet at a package addressed to my daughter.The return address said 'Lucy'.I opened the package, atop of which was a letter."Dear Kayla,

Thank you for the letter.It sounds to me like your parents really don't want you to have a pony.Lucky for them, this isn't a pony.Enjoy the stallion.-Satan

P.S.In this package you also received a small fire extinguisher.You will need it.Have your parents show you how to use it."&nbsp;
