"You know Jack, you're a real asshole sometimes.But, in a good way."The two men both erupted into laughter while sharing a warm beverage over a campfire.They sipped on it slowly while passing it to each other.Jack looked up at the sky, smiling, "You know, I'll never get over this.Looking up at this sky at night.It leaves me breathless.It's nights like this that I'm alright being alive forever.Wouldn't you agree, Sam?"Sam took the drink from Jack and looked upwards, "Yeah, I agree.Makes me wish I had what you had.But only on nights like this.""You know I'll try to find a way to make it stop," Jack said, poking at the fire."I know.But I've been travelling for what seems like forever.I've practically forgotten my age.I just wish I knew when it would happen.At least I know when and where I'm going, at least."Jack moved closer, throwing his arm around Sam, "What's it been...5,000 years, give or take, since I first met you?You've been meeting up with me in random parts of my life.It's nice to have that stability, of knowing someone, just as I'm sure it's nice for you.You know I'm not going anywhere so I'm going to do my best to make sure you don't either, alright?You're my friend.The only real one I've got.No matter where, nor when you're at.I'm here for you."Sam tried to hid what seemed like a tear but Jack saw and lightly punched his arm, "Thanks man.It means a lot.But quit being all sappy with me and get it through your head What you'll be encountering in 300 years.That where I'm from we have little rectangles that can let people talk to other people across the world.You have to accept it man."Jack shook his head, "Look, I believe you and all, but the thing that shocks me the most is that we aren't using fire for light anymore."They both erupted into laughter again, only to be interrupted by the ground shaking around them."No, no, no.Not again!I only just got settled!"Sam yelled in anger."Sam!Quickly, tell me what you see and I will find you!"Sam closed his eyes to concentrate as he began to float into the air, "Times Square, New York City, year 3631.Jack, ple-," he was cut off as he went sent into the future.Jack, with barely any time to react with what happened, fell to his knees.*

He awoke, shivering from the intense cold.The frozen air stole his words before he could speak.He glanced up and saw dark figure approaching him in hurried pace.The figure wrapped him up in large protective blanket as he was picked up and carried off."Ja-Jack?"He looked forward into the cold emptiness that used to be New York and looked down at him, "It's Malcolm now.You've got a lot of catching up to do if you're going to survive."
