I first saw Tony about a week after college.It was at a party a coworker was throwing.Tony was the other guy at the party who didnt seem to know anybody besides the host.Id see him standing around small groups of people throughout the night, but never really saw him say anything.Hed laugh when someone would tell a joke, granted, but he never seemed to add to the conversation.I assumed he was shy and didnt think much of it at the time, who was I to judge social skills?I saw him around town a few times over the next few months, buying groceries, renting movies, or leaving a restaurant.Still, I never actually saw him interact with anyone else.It started to bother me about a year later.Id see Tony once or twice a month at this point, granted in a town this size, thats not a whole lot.I realized I was going crazy when I thought about following him.Id seen him leaving restaurants after all, if I just followed him to one, Id get to see him order and be done with it.Thankfully, I realized the rational thing to do would to be say, Hi the next time I saw him.The very next day he pulled up behind me to use the Redbox.I had to laugh as I realized how paranoid I was being about the guy, one of us had to arrive somewhere before the other, it was just chance he was always going out as I was coming in.So I scrolled to the next screen and casually asked him, like it wasnt a big deal I was finally going to get to hear the guy speak to someone after all this time.You just returning?If so you can go ahead, I may browse for a minute.  I awaited his reply with the same eagerness school children show towards the end of the day.I was not disappointed, as I was able to have my first conversation with the totally normal, Tony.No, Im renting too, take your time man.
Thanks, any suggestions?Anything I shouldnt take because you have your eye on? I laughed, he laughed.I clicked on the Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2 and added it to my cart.I was going to rent the new Guardians movie. He said, as I froze before hitting checkout.I turned to actually face the man I had obsessed about never having seen interact.I hear its a real trip.
I laughed, Great minds think alike.If you werent just saying that because you saw me add it to my cart, what do you say you come over to my place, we can hang out and watch it?I hear its hard to make new friends after college, why not make the most of an opportunity?  
He accepted and thats when we became friends.The weird thing was, I stopped seeing him around town so often after that.We started hanging out though, and I got to know the guy, he was nice, caring, but had a crazy since of humor, would just say some of the most bizarre things, We should murder those children. Just slit that bitchs throat, then when you choke her, you can say you were trying to save her from bleeding out.  Weird things like that.I never really got it the joke, and would usually just react with shock, but I think my shock is what he found funny.About a month ago, Tony was let go from his job.The small company just had to cut back, and Tony had been there the shortest.He was living paycheck to paycheck, and couldnt afford rent, so I let him move in to the spare bedroom in my apartment.Maybe its just the extra exposure, but I do feel like the crazy things he says have been more frequent since he moved in.I cant remember the last time I got a decent nights rest, and I cant figure out why.Hes not loud at night; he doesnt make any noise after he goes to bed at all in fact.I dont see him again until the next evening usually, as Im getting home from work.Usually, we chat, we eat, watch some TV or play some video games, and go to sleep.I didnt see Tony at all yesterday.Hes an adult, he can do his own thing without me worrying about him, but I did find it odd.I went to bed and slept like a rock.For the first time in a long time, I slept through the night.However I woke up more tired than Ive been in years.My whole body feels like I didnt sleep at all, and I was doing some strenuous activity all night.Granted my dreams were a little, vivid, and darker than normal, Im sure I tossed and turned all night.Maybe a new mattress would help?Anyways, I have a voicemail from Tony this morning, from my parents number of all places.This is weird for two reasons; one, I dont remember ever actually introducing Tony to my parents, and two, my phone usually wakes me when it rings.He says, Hey man, my mother and father were killed last night, and I inherited a lot of money as a result.Ill make sure to get you covered for that month of rent.  I shook my head, people think about the craziest things when they are struck with bad news.I wasnt worried about money for the favor I offered a friend, I never would have asked for it.I just hope hes ok, losing ones parents, is just awful.I deleted the message and listened to the second message, I also somehow slept through.Hi mister Cavanagh, This is Detective Thomas with the Boone County police department.If you could just give us a call when you get this Sir, we dont seem to have an address on file with you and there is something that we would like to talk to you about in person.
The police?What on Earth do the police want?Im too tired for this right now.Im going to call into work and get some rest.Maybe try to get ahold of Tony when I get up, make sure hes ok, the guy just lost his parents, the police and whatever they want can wait.--------
Great prompt, I hope this isn't awful.
