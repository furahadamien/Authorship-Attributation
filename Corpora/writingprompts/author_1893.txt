*Trudy Moore was an exceptional soul in death.*

&#x200B;

All the great thinkers and victims of genius were once upon a time huddled in a circle, all plotting?no, the great men with big brains and unbreakable wills were simply sharing stories of copulation, who knew einstein was such a pig?that edgar allan poe was a little bit gay?all of these men had secrets to share, but after milenia of telling, of theorizing, these men now behaved like children, huddled in a circle whispering to each other how big a girl's bossum was, how hard it was to keep at it for little longer than ten minutes, these men had lost all sense of time, all sense of respect for the eternal, because wherever they were "*was a little bit farther than forever*", as Nietzche put it one day trying to find a wall, a limit a hand which would say "THE END"; the philosopher came up short, taking a small row boat on an odyssey through a clear crystal ocean which never ended, he arrived shore one day just short of where they all group together, walked to his friends, sat down and sighed, Plato asked *" Have you found nothing as i said you would?how far did you row from us?"*, Nietzche sat up straight and said *" I rowed for many times, how far i went i don't see the reason to ask, for i never stopped rowing straight ahead "*.Everyone was quiet *" It never got dark, it never went slow, it wasn't ever fast, no storm broke my gaze, no kraken swallowed me, yet i rowed straight and i'm here one more time".*

Now the great thinkers were quietly admiring a confused man from afar.&#x200B;

*"Is it that Bowie fellow again?"* asked churchill excitedly while he played with the sand

*"Last i heard, David went swimming talking about "Finding Atlantean People""* 

*"That was milenias ago, he probably faded away like* ***regular folks*** *do, rock has been dead for a while now"* added Basquiat

*"Well if it ain't going to dance with us or offer us a'piece, he can bother off"* said Shakespear, bored with the fellow from afar

*"Speaking of pieces "* said david foster wallace "*someone get nietzche*".*"Where is that mopey fellow ?, he had the biggest piece to play with before we found Brando"*

*"he was never big into our 'parties', yknow he only had eyes for trudy"*

*"Gentlemen, i think it's time we come clean with ourselves and stop calling them our 'parties'"* said Bethoven

Trudy was and will always be the great love of the eternal plane just a bit farther than forever, Monroe and Cleopatra were passed around like LSD, for they were like a drug, two of the most beautiful women were happy to spend time with any folk, any genius across, forever young, forever in the mood to have fun.*Not nietzche*, never broken by the passing of time, he longed for love, a real connection.For the dead-never-forgotten grieve the same connection living people desire... a transcending love ready to explode with confetti and bright vivid colours when it dies holding each other's hands.everything was limitless, everything was free, everyone passed around..

Nietzche was sitting down writing with a pointed stone upon a rock

*" Trudy, i scowl at the lives who forgot all about you, who could forget the girl who broke my heart?my heart suffers for your love, i'll never keep it hidden, it's been so long, upon this rock, wishing it was before today, before forever started, wishing it was the forever many forevers ago when i met you..."*

\-

Trudy was wearing a silk-sky blue dress when she faded, she was looking over the same rock nieztche sits forevers ahead.Forever then nietzche held her hand tightly, trudy fixed her hair looked at nietzche and said *"Darling you have to let go of me now"*.*"What if you never come back?"* said nietzche worried, like a child, *"Then it'll finally be my time to go", i'm not as popular as you my love, i was only a small girl when i died, my parents died many years ago, remember?i said goodbye to them today"."It's always today"* said nieztche miserably *"a night never comes by, can't you stay with me for a little longer?",* trudy laughed and held his face with her hand *"My sweet, you'll never get used to this will you?you still speak like it's the year you died, you still say things like 'little longer' while time doesn't come here, friedich you'll always be human won't you?"* she smiled so brightly, looking at her old soulmate, caressing his cheek with her only free hand *"Let me hold your face with my own two hands, let me touch your hair and feel your lips with my fingertips.."* she kissed him on the cheek *"But i'll never see you again, i can't be alone anymore"* said nietzche.\-

Forever now nitzche stood up from his lonely rock and looked down at the ocean, not clashing, not moving, forever static.Nietzche yelled in pain to the sea, to the blue sky with no clouds, to the geniuses down by the shore sneering secretly, to all the folks who would come here and leave, to the ones who never met trudy.*"Curse you Trudy!You broke my soul and temperament!Curse you for loving me!I can't go back to those* ***freaks*** *down by the shore!i'll never be complete again!*" Nietzche cried out, in tears in agony towards all the usual suspects.all the yelling could be heard through out the land, George Harrison looked around trying to find the source of the pain.*" I'll never be free from this!, I'll never see a falling star ever again!Curse You !"* nietzche collapsed on the rock, sobbing and gripping his writing stone, he cried in pain **one final time.**

*"Was that Nietzche?"* asked van gogh 

*"Huh?yeah, never liked him"*

CLASH!a drop of rain hit nietzche's forehead, nietzche opened his sobbing eyes, to hear the clashing and rock smashing of ocean's waves, nietzche stood up slowly, air hitting his face, sending his hair back completely mesmerized by the sound of the earth, the soaking sky, every second it rained harder, and harder until the drops were long, spikes of harmless water soaking everyone's hair, turning the sand brown, everyone hurridy covered each other, all folks and geniuses huddled together, churchill was cleaning his glasses with the bottom of his vest "Bloody Fuck!, who's the idiot who left the water running?! "everyone laughed, like merry men and women, looking at each other not as "pieces" or brains, or ticking clocks, but as people.splashed with the sight of real souls laughing at a poor joke, they all embraced each other, crying into another shoulder...

nietzche wet with the rain, cold like the wind, put his hands in his pockets, looked up and smiled *"See You Soon Trudy"* turning his back to the sea he whistled to the end of the hill....
