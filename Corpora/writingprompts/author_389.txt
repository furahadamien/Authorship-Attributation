They all questioned it.Why would you want to be a bouncer?I can't blame my friends for thinking that way, of course.It seemed like a tedious job, with little reward.And it was tedious, but it was possibly the easiest job I could have.Checking IDs was just a formality.the numbers floating above everyone's heads were what really have them away.It took me a while to figure out what they were.I remember when I did though.Standing in front of the mirror on the day of my eighth birthday, as the number above my head morphed from a 7 into an 8.My gift, if you want to call it that, made this job stupidly easy.I didn't have to pay much attention to the contents of IDs.The numbers gave them all away.I'd earned a bit of a reputation with the high schoolers, at least Id heard.None of them had slipped past me yet.And they probably wouldn't.After a while the monotony did begin to get annoying.I'd taken to drinking a little bit, just to make the day more enjoyable.It didn't affect my ability at all, as long as I could make out the numbers.On yet another night of turning away underaged kids, I was getting bored.Some of the same faces, some new.And then one that was new, but had to be old.That number couldn't be right.9999.Was the alcohol affecting me?No, that wouldn't make any sense.It never has before.Below that number, all alone, was a stunning blonde.There were some real model types that came here but, this one, she was something else.As my jaw dropped slightly, I saw a quick smile as she looked away.Glancing back at her ID it said she was 23.I was beyond confused.I mean she was old enough to be in here but, no, that can't be right.After taking way too long, I let her in.It stuck with me, the whole night.Not one more person had such an outrageous number.I definitely wasn't experiencing some alcohol induced hallucinations.But I had to figure this out.On my break I looked around the club.She was nowhere to be seen.Glancing at the somewhat empty bar, I spotted a flash of golden hair.That was her, still all alone, somehow.I couldn't help myself.I had to talk to her.I sat beside her and asked for a drink from Barry, the bartender.She glanced over at me and smiled.It was now or never.So, uh, this may sound weird but, your ID said you're 23, and, I uh, you look a bit older, ah, yeah. Spoken like a true gentleman.I was kicking myself mentally.Really, she asked inquisitively, and how old do I look? She didn't sound the least bit offended.I mean, like at least, uh, 26? I stammered out.And then in a laughing tone, Well, Ill take that as a compliment 


I couldn't believe she hadn't asked me to leave yet.But that 9999 above her head still had me puzzled.There's something Id like to ask you, I began.She looked at me seductively and quietly said, Yes.Let's go to my apartment. 


I was dumbfounded.I had not expected anything like this but before I knew it she was leading me out of the club and into a taxi.The ride there was a blur, I was too confused, and she was to stunning not to be focused on.When we finally got to get apartment, she dragged me inside into the living room.And without realizing I was on her sofa with this jaw-dropping woman next to me.Gnawing at the back of my mind was still that number.She leaned in closer to me and whispered in my ear,  I need you to do something for me


Barely comprehending I replied, Anything 

She leaned closer, her mouth right at my ear, I need about tree-fiddy 


I pulled away, staring back at her, when I realized, I was sitting right next to a building sized crustacean from the Paleozoic era.Stunned, it came to me, that that God damned Loch Ness Monster tricked me again.*Thanks for reading this!Ive never commented here before, but this ending came to me as soon as I read the prompt.Hope you enjoyed, and tell me what could be better!*
