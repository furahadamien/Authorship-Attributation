Tamir stiffened, the focus of his eyes drifting from a symbol hanging from the wall in front of him..Doubt had crept into his mind as he felt the sensation leave his outstretched arm.He scowled slightly, letting out an audible sigh before he felt a presence drift in behind him.Keep trying, Tamir.Syncing with the mana flow is the most difficult part of utilizing it.Once you accomplish that, manipulating it is as simple as a brush stroke.

Tamir turned to face a rather elderly man draped in a purple robe.A pendant filled with blue liquid hung from his neck.With every hobble it seemed to shimmer in the dim lighting of the underground cavern.And what of the constructs, old man?Do you think we...do you think I can create something big enough, something strong enough to take down the ship hovering over Chicago?

The elderly man nodded, and reassuringly placed one hand on Tamirs shoulder.A gentle smile unfolded across his lips.He suddenly stopped and took a step back.Try again, I want to see your from, and do not let your eyes leave that symbol.

Tamir sighed again, this time the audible tone nearly reverberated against the cave walls.Inhaling, he took a step forward and stretched his arm out while steadying his breath.The inhalation was deep, for about seven seconds before he held it for four, then released it in seven more.He could feel a tingling sensation as something flowed over every nerve, it was familiar and something he had experienced multiple times before.It was akin to grasping the hand of a loved one, but any emotion - fear, doubt, anger - would lose that grip.He closed his eyes and began his second round of breathing.*Inhale* Tendrils enveloped his arm, the ends gently lapping at the contours of his fingers.*Holding that breath* He felt the edges encircle his hand, gripping tighter, the edges tickling his palms.*Exhale* His eyes widened and he felt the tingling sensation grow warmer.His arm was now wrapped in what felt like a vibrating blanket.The-there it is... the elderly mans voice stammered beside him, Now, let go...

The elderly mans words became distorted as Tamir felt the blanket grow and encircle his body, the warmth spreading like fire.The symbol hanging on a fine leather lace glowed slightly in his vision, burning its meaning into his brain.At first he panicked and his breathing quickened until the blanket covered him, bit by bit, swirling until it twisted in shape and constricted, sinking into him and bringing about an uncanny calm.When the process finished, he let out a deep moan and nearly fell backward, losing his balance before the elderly man stepped forward to brace him.Youve done it, Tamir!I can feel the connection to the mana flow in you.

Tamir let out a sigh of relief and stepped forward, angling himself upright and away from the elderly man.Although the process had left him very exhausted, the new flow of energy coursing through his body seemed to stave off any kind of desire for rest.He looked down seeing a blue tinted aura enveloping his body.Now, create the fire symbol for a simple flare.

He took the same stance as before, stretching his arm out.He began his breathing routine, his mind focusing on the symbol as the calm unfolded upon him, and his mind drifted.He felt confident, more so than he ever felt before.In the old days he had, like most others, lost hope for retaliation against the Srawn.They had come suddenly, two decade prior, and within five years they had wiped out the majority of the human population.A few of the larger population centers had grown into colonies.His was Chicago.At a young ago, he was given away, sold to the elderly man on the promise of shelter, regular meals and hope by his parents.They still believed, but in his heart he just wanted an escape from the colony ghetto.The elderly man had seen something in Tamir.He said his aura resonated with his pendant of blue blood, or whatever he called it, that hung around his neck.Maybe he was right.As Tamir focused, the wandering of his memories lightly touching the back of his mind, the symbol shimmered to life before him.This one was different than the physical symbol hanging from the ceiling.It seemed to appear in mid-air as a shimmering white light and within moments, the hue of changed to a bright orange color.The sensation of letting go overcame him as he felt the grip tighten.He held tight to it, adamant in unrelinquishing the flow of mana.The longer he held out, the brighter the symbol became.When he finally let go, the symbol flashed in an instant out of existence and was followed by a voluminous boom which knocked him off balance and sent him to the ground.He coughed a bit, and looked up seeing a haze of dust.Standing up, he brushed off his pants, briefly turning to face the elderly man.To his surprise, the elderly man face was twisted into a state of shock and awe.Tamir furrowed his brow and followed the elderly mans line of vision to the wall thirty feet from them.He could see a large flickering shape in the middle of blackened and scorched stone.The flickering shape bubbled and dripped down the curve which now adorned the stone wall.Y-you turned it m-molten. The elderly man finally spoke, eyes still wide in disbelief.He stumbled forward and began laughing hysterically.Tamir looked at him quizzically then at the wall.So...that was a good thing, that thing I did? He pointed to the scorched crater.The elderly man smiled.Yes, very much so...now, lets work on our constructs.
