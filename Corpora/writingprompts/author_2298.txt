*I drove around the sharp curve, only to see a huge pick up truck right in front of my small car, on the wrong side of the road.I swerved, only to realize that was the wrong thing to do and I ended up driving off the cliff.I saw the forest, and the huge field with the barn at the other side of the valley.Everything was a blur, as I slammed against the steering wheel, passing out.*

My eyes fluttered open, and I looked around.I was in a pink room, with a bed in the corner with beanie babies covering it, a few missing.There was a toy box at the end of the bed, and a few toys scattered around the room.There was a tot table in the middle of the room, with a beautiful rug under it, with some stains on it.There was a six year old girl with tan skin, straight black hair and a red bow holding her hair into a ponytail.She had a pastel yellow and pink dress, dark brown eyes and she was playing with a white bear with red and blue stars on it.In another chair, there was a huge green and brown turtle plushie with a tea cup in front of it.The little girl raised her head, noticing me."Ms. Fox!Your here!Come join my tea party, we have business to discuss."The little girl chirped, getting up.She skipped over to me, grabbing my hand and dragging me over.She let go of my hand, and I sat down, dazed."Who- who are you?"I stuttered as I was getting used to the little girl's room."Sakina Dodson!Don't you remember me, Mayor Rosa Fox?"She kicked her legs under the table, and I noticed she had pastel purple flats.I blinked, looking around."Sakina, where are your parents?"I asked, looking at the door."Mama's gonna come in with the cookies soon!Daddy is something that mom calls prison!"I stared at Sakina, a bit surprised.**All right, dad's in prison and mom's going to sell cookies at her school's bake sale**.I thought, composing myself as I prepared for playing dress up or pretend or whatever kids do now days."Okay, Ms. Dodson, what would you like to discuss?"Sakina immediately straightened, glancing at the small white bear plushie."Miss Spangle-" She waved towards the July themed bear, "would like to have a larger pay- money- paycheck?Cashcheck?"Sakina stuttered at the end, not knowing what it was called."Paycheck, sweetie."I corrected, smiling at her.&#x200B;
