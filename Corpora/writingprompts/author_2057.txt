The proposition was simple enough, torture people in hell,, or be tortured.It was the classic kill or be killed scenario, as I had the thought I must've grinned because satan was now grabbing me a set of keys and a pitchfork."I know it's pretty stereotypical and all but y'know the big guy upstairs apparently has a very specific taste in aesthetics" 

I took my pitchfork and keys down to what I had been informed was the conference room.It was weirdly professional, definitely wasn't like some of those movies where everything in hell is just a  mass of fire, flames and flesh, which made the pitchfork seem extra strange.I sat down at a table with 14 other people who also accepted the devils offer.They looked like I would expect and I stuck out like a sore thumb, a small blonde woman compared to Jonny B. Thuggins.There was one other person that stuck out, he was a slight man wearing a bland grey t-shirt and black cargo pants, it was so unassuming it was a tad unnerving.We sat for a short while before this tall gorgeous brunette woman hurriedly walked in.I could almost hear the jaws hit the floor as she made her way across the room.Upon getting to the front her shape morphed, slowly shimmering slightly before it felt like I had blinked the sleep out of my eyes but suddenly this short portly man was standing at the front of the room.I could feel the general mood of the room go from surprise to confusion, almost anger.The short man spoke up."I am your guide, I will explain how things work here."After a while, we had been informed about the workings of hell.It ran on the negative, a supposed attempt at balancing the universe.Because of course the more good, the more bad.We were the ones that needed to counter all the good and we had endless supplies to do it.I even had the ability to shapeshift and control vivid hallucinations to provoke the negative out of people.The worse we were down here the better the universe "could be" based on our upsetting the scales.It was an elegant system I guess.and despite my short life as an atheist I was suddenly sure that there was a higher power in the universe, he/she may have been a dick but... he/she's a real dick... so theres that.It was also made apparent that being new I'd purposely be put on with people that had "wronged me"  didn't quite know what that had meant but it quickly became apparent that wronged has a very broad and vague definition.I walked in on my first appointment, each room had a potentially infinite space packed into a 3foot by 3foot closet, each closet had an iron door with a pad of paper stuck to the front,I eyed the paper.>Doc.Thomas Anthony Brian Williams.Shows that I just missed mr. Unassuming.I open the door.Doc.Tom.Is watching in horror as a father cradles his dead newborn violently shouting at the doctor.I couldn't hear a thing before I entered, but after I walked in the room changed, doc.Just kinda stared, this was normal for him I could tell he was expecting all kinds of horrible things to happen when the room solidified again.Something in me felt a mixture of sympathy and excitement, I seen an opportunity to both be a bit less intense while still getting relatively the same result.I changed the room it was night in the mountains, it was chilly, and the doc.Didn't have a sweater, he walked towards a town into a small caf one I had worked at and knew very well.He enters to find me, smiling behind the counter.A bit of confusion crosses his face, too normal?He walks up cautiously I could tell he knew something was up."Hello, and good evening sir.Did you need anything in particular?""Uh yes, where am I?"The confusion seems to be causing him distress."This is the browntown downtown caf, we're in downtown browntown.""What?!""Yes sir!Best coffee in town."I lean in a bit too close "I heard it's your birthday, free coffee and croissants for those celebrating," 
I wink for effect."It's not my birthday..." 
"Sure it is" 
"No it's not" 
"Well whens your birthday?"" august" 
"Well its August" I say gesturing to a calendar I basically pulled out of my ass.
"25th?"I hand him a croissant and point to a table, "yep, happy birthday!I'll be right out with the coffee."I never showed up again.I left him sitting waiting for a coffee that will never come.I left the room.Looking at the checklist, 8/10
Pops up beside my name on the room.Almost as good as Mr. Unassuming with his 9/10
Suprising considering the vast difference between our individual methods.**a week(ish) later** 

"you've maintained a 7/10 average on all your appointments, yet the majority of what you do is just leave them waiting one way or another."the question felt weirdly personal despite the vagueness of it."I worked customer service for 15 years my guy, I know all to well that most people get triggered when they've had a bad time and then get told to wait for something perceived as good.I.e.a coffee, or cake."The explanation wasn't good enough, satan raised an eyebrow at me."That doesn't seem too bad" 

He looks at me again with an intensity I'll never get used too."Not in and of itself but I've somehow managed to  end up following Jeffery around, the guys fucked up in the head.I've walked in on a lot of dead baby themed rooms, the dude is deliberately traumatizing them like you asked but I feel theres a level of thought to it most of us don't realize.Even though he's almost hyperfocused on the dead baby thing he too preys simply on the feeling of helplessnes."" yes I like his work."He says nodding as he eats an apple."The reason both our methods work well together is because his work is more up in your face, deliberately trying to pull the negative, its literal torture for people, to feel completely helpless when your confronted.It's some fight or flight shit but his simulations remove the options to fight or flight.""Yeah, he knows what he wants and he'll do whatever it takes to get it."He says nonchalantly like this is just another tuesday."In doing so he's teaching helplessness, theres nothing they can do about the situation and the people know that, so they freeze.A sort of numbness that comes with the expectation of pain."" Yeah, I've broken many a person before" he talks about this with a lightness that I could never wrap my head around.Satan must've been a literal psychopath, able to control the emotional response to things.Once seen him chip a chunk off his horn playing with hellhounds, dude was more vain than even arachne (interestingly enough she was real, the story got a bit warped, it wasn"t the gods that killed her it was a man... attempting to rape her, she had been stabbed and bleed out, she to choose to be a torturer rather than a victim)

"Yes well I'm playing one of the psychological sides, they're expecting to get fucked with y'know?And thanks to Jeffrey they're expecting to be made to feel helpless in the worst ways, I just make them feel helpless in some less worse ways.Which leaves them with that big black cloud of paranoia hovering at the back of their minds.""So then you know what your doing it's not just that your being a shit torturer that's really lucky..." 
He strokes his chin as he appears deep in thought for a moment before realizing I was still there."Well get back to it then."So I did, I began my rounds again...**Part2?**
