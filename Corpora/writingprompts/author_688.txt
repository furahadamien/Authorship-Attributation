I remember smiling as I gently stroked my 1 year-old daughters hair.She had been sleeping peacefully for the last 3 hours as I sat and watched her, the knife laying across my lap.I remember clearly the day it arrived.In a dream, a booming voice called out to me, telling me that I am to be the salvation of the Earth, and the savior of so many.I was told that in 5 years time our planet would be consumed by fire and destruction, and that this knife was the key to saving as many as I could.I didn't start with family, that would have made it too obvious who I was.Initially I murdered random people on the street.Homeless people who were suffering, drug addicts and alcoholics that no longer felt they had purpose in this world.I was bad at it at first...I felt incredibly guilty for the suffering I caused the time I had to stab a woman 23 times to get her to stop screaming.Over time I had honed my craft, and now found immense joy in knowing that my victims would painlessly slip away to a better place.When I was told my wife was dying during childbirth, I came so close to blowing my cover so I could save her life, save her from an eternity of nothingness.But when I saw my daughters sweet face as she lay across my wife's chest for the first and last time...I couldn't bring myself to ruin that moment with bloodshed.And so here I was a year later... the world would end in 6 months, but my daughter and I would not be there to see it.I stood and raised my knife over my head.As it fell through the air, though, my door was slammed open, a swat team barged in shooting my in the back three times.I fell, panicking as I realized I had fallen onto the dagger.I crawled towards my daughter as the police lifted her out of her crib.She was crying and I tried to call out, but I could not find my breath.I awoke in a paradise, crowds of people surrounding me and cheering.Tears of joy falling down their faces as they thanked me for saving them...Many of them hugged their families as they smiled at me, but I would never see my family again.
