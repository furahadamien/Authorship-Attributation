Bond heard the rockets ignite.Strapped into the car, the G-force drove him backwards into the seat, sending his cheeks tearing into his face.His lungs compressed, then almost collapsed, as his entire being shook.All the while, he thought he could hear Musk's evil laugh.He would not go out like this.****

The rockets plunged into space.At his current trajectory, he would forever be stuck in orbit, his corpse withering away in isolation - the perfect crime.Musk would have won, and no one on earth would know that their savior was in fact their doom.Musk had revealed his plans for humanity in true villain fashion - even he could not resist a monologue.Bond knew how helpless his situation was.There were no parachutes, no way to cancel the payload detachment.Though Bond had survived countless missions before, he knew that this was his end.But he planned to go out in style.He eventually managed to pry his right arm loose from the straps.With that, he switched on the car, accessing the GPS system.He knew there was no way of landing safely back on earth... he could only crash.But he could crash with *purpose*.Musk had let his hubris get the better of him, Bond thought, as he hacked into the GPS system with a small, metallic object - a deceptively simple device, but then again, Musk was a man of simple efficiency.He used the same GPS system on the car as the rockets itself, and it was a simple task of linking the two operating systems together.He typed in his destination, pressed 'confirm', and felt the rockets shudder.They used the last of their fuel to divert their course back to earth, then detached themselves soundlessly.Bond kept on telling himself it was for the good of the world.That this was a selfless act.But deep down, he tasted revenge.As he entered the atmosphere, the car burning up, he stared at the blinking GPS system.His destination was nearing, ever so quickly.As he felt his suit set alight, as a magnificent house came into view, he could only hope that Musk was home.****

I awoke in the night, the distant sounds of screams altogether too familiar.It didn't sound isolated - they must have found a safe-haven.Hundreds would be massacred.It was just like I said; don't bunch together.Don't rely on each other for support.Survival is all about laying low, keeping quiet and hoping that luck was on your side.I'd been having a strange dream.It wasn't a nightmare, which was rare already; it was more of a premonition.I'd felt a burning sensation in my hand, as if there were energy coursing through it.The feeling still stuck with me, and I focused on it to try drown out the screams.********

There were more of them now; towering beasts, eldritch monstrosities.We'd imagined aliens as these advanced beings, visiting us with technology that we could not even comprehend, bestowing knowledge and gifts.But no.They were unimaginable nightmares, drifting in through space, landing on our forsaken planet and hunting us mercilessly.Our combined efforts only took down a few, and the ensuing nuclear winter only made things worse.And now they hunt us down without rest.It doesn't seem to be for sustenance - they ignore other animals, though they will harm them if it is in their way.No; it feels like eradication.And more come every day.But the the dreams won't go away.What little sleep I have is filled with feelings of flame and fury; of ominous premonition, of terrifying power.I feel that energy more and more.I suspect that I am going mad, but I'd rather be mad than dead.And judging by my travels, it seems that I am one of the few left with the privilege of choice.Sleep comes to me eventually, the incessant chittering of the aliens filtering through my dreams of intrigue, of primal power.*****

I awoke to a sound of crashing, of beastly lumbering.*I've been found.*

I sprinted from my lair, a crumbling ruin, just as a jagged tentacle pierced through the foundations.Rubble collapsed around me as I leapt through a window, landing on the floor below in a clumsy roll.There was no time to think about the pain - only escape.I ran as fast as I could, praying that it was only one, praying that it could not keep up.There were many different forms of alien, and most of the massive ones were slow in the city.They could run at least as fast as a man, but the buildings and ruins proved ample obstacles.With a bit of luck, I could survive this.I had done so before.A sudden crash to my right sent glass flying just ahead of me.An arthropod the size of a large dog landed in front of me, its razor-sharp legs digging into the floor.There was no chance of running from it.But if I climbed the building to avoid it, my pursuer would destroy it as if it was a cardboard box.I had two choices, but either led to death.My right hand burned, a sharp red glow emitting from my palm.It felt like trapped electricity.Like every bit of primal power focused into a single thought.A choice:

Shall I **fight**, or **flee**?****

I heard the killer's steps echo across the basement.I tried to think of some last line to make sense of it all, to die with a semblance of honour.Instead, I just whimpered; the days of relentless torture had left me a shell of a man.He strode toward me, relishing in the moment.He took great pleasure in watching me suffer, and today was no different.He pulled out his serrated blade, glinting in the light above the chair I was tied to."Looks like you're no fun anymore," he said, smiling wide and exposing his rotten teeth.He gripped the blade.I heard a rustling, some kind of scurrying behind me.The light went out - but it hadn't turned off.Something- some*things* - were crawling across it.I tried to scream, but I had no energy left.Then I realised - they weren't after me.They had finally come.*My spiderbros.*

We'd seen it in the distance, an anomaly on an already alien planet.Thought it some kind of mirage, since the reality just didn't make sense.I volunteered to go check it out, though we all knew what it was - and when I'd just confirmed it.A Soviet flag.Why hadn't they told us?I'd heard rumour of a Soviet mission, decades back, but we'd written it off as Cold War propaganda.If they'd actually managed to get to Mars, even if they didn't get them back - that would be humanity's greatest accomplishment.*Why hadn't they told us?*

What could it mean?Had the Russkies simply lost contact and assumed the worst?That didn't make any sense, since if they landed intact enough to erect the flag, they must have been in communication with them back home...

Something was wrong.I needed to get back.I tried to make contact with the boys back at the ship, but there was no reply.Figured I was out of range, but that didn't make sense.Brushed it aside; nerves were getting the better of me, and there was no use worrying about something I couldn't change.Saw my team in the distance.It was immensely comforting; you've never known isolation till you're alone on a new planet.I quickened my pace.Still radio silence.I just wanted to get back to the ship.Nearing them now.They seem to be coated in sand - had there been some kind of storm?How long had I been gone for?They didn't seem to be moving, either.Just standing there.Why were they just standing there?Still no response.Why aren't they coming out to meet me?Why are they just *standing* there?I can see their suits properly now.Coated in sand.Weatherworn.And why... why do they look like they're a different colour underneath?Are those- are those *Soviet* suits?*Why are they just standing there?*

Wait.That's not- that's not my-

*They've seen me.*

**Oh Christ, they've seen me.**

I stared at the man.His grizzled features only made his eyes more striking - this man had seen some shit.I felt myself shaking."What the hell was that?"I blurted out, looking at the remains of my wallet.There was a thick, purplish ooze bleeding out of the leather.Teeth lined the edges.Better if you dont know, he said, looking from side to side, gun still drawn.I doubt youll even believe me, even after what you just saw.

I stared at the creature that was once my wallet."Try me."He sighed, putting his gun away."Ok.But not here.It's not safe."The man led us into a nearby bar, ordering two drinks before we sat down.I was still shaking, but he was as calm as an ocean breeze."Ever heard of capitalism?Consumerism?"he asked, not a hint of irony in his voice."I believe I've heard the terms, yes," I replied, trying to not sound sarcastic."We're living in a society that worships *things*.Ownership.Materials.Goods, that are supposed to make us so happy.Then why are we all so fucking depressed?"I said nothing, motioning for him to continue."Well, they're coming alive.There's some kind of global consciousness that's bringing them into power - we're creating them.And they're feeding off us... more and more, they're feeding off our urge for *more*.""How did you find out about this?""The hard way," he replied, taking a massive swig from his drink."Never been a much of a buyer myself.Feels like I'm the only one that can see it, this virus that's feeding off of us.That's taking over us."I took some time to process it all.I felt a fear deep in my gut, gnawing away at me."How did you know my wallet was one of them?"I asked.He finished the last of his drink, then stared at me."Son, I'm not sure if you understand - *every wallet is one of them*."****

Part II will come soon, if there's any interest <3

"Jolly good show, my good man," he said, sitting on the right of my shoulder and inhaling deeply from his pipe."Positively smashing."I'd been watching Stranger Things for the last couple hours, trying to block them out."What kinda trash is this?"the man on the left of my shoulder chimed, pacing up and down the length of it."This is just garbage, garbage I tells ya.Barb don't deserve to go like that."I sighed.I had not been succeeding.********

The bank teller peered quizzically at my shoulders, and I tried to smile."Please, it's best to just try and ignore them," I told her, glancing down briefly and praying that Mike would be able to keep it together."It's an, errr, *condition*.""Nice rack on this bird, yaknowwhatI'mtalkin'about?"he said, staring directly at her chest.Charles leaned over to chastise him."Now now Mike, what have we told you about manners?Although I dare say, that is certainly a bountiful bosom."I apologized profusely before security could escort me out.****

After much deliberation, the two of them convinced me to go out to the library.This was always a challenging affair, as libraries were made for silence, and regardless, the three of us would need to pick a book that all of us liked to read.No such book existed.I - or we - were browsing the aisle, Charles trying to direct me to eighteenth century geopolitics, Mike complaining that there were no porn mags.I whispered for them to be quiet, and in the ensuing silence I heard three women speaking in increasing volume to my right.The librarian shushed the women, and I heard one of them apologize, then the three continued in hushed voices.Again the librarian told them to be quiet.I rounded the corner, engrossed in my quest for fiction, and accidentally bumped into one of them.Well, *all* of them."Watch where you're goin', ya fuckhead!"a tiny voice said while I attempted to pick up the fallen books."Fran, please watch your language, as I think you'll find we are in the company of gentlemen," another tiny voice said, as I - or we - slowly looked up.A beautiful woman stood before us.Furthermore, two more women stood on *her*."By Gods," Charles said, dropping his pipe."Fuck me," Mike replied."I...I..." I stammered."Please, don't mind them," the woman said with a nervous smile.I nodded, still speechless.I'd never been able to talk to girls, not with these two on my shoulders.But this...This could work."Take this guy to pound town before I do it myself," the tiny, brash woman on her left chimed."Or perhaps a delicatessen first?"the tiny, posh woman on her right replied.The librarian shushed us on our way out.****
