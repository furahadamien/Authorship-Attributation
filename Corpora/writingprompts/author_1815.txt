My family heritage dates back to dog year 7933 from a German Shepherd named Archduke Cornelius Esqueband...the caretaker named him Ace.He was a police dog and all 7 generations have served with our caretaker.Many risking fang and paw to protect him and many going down in the line of action.The caretaker took good care of my family and I have fond memories of him letting me run round in the large field which I owned of course.The caretakers son had helped my father's generation and was caretaker to my uncle until he ate a rasin.What a way to go...The caretaker is slow nowadays, he  relies on other people took care of him,  but I guard and love him none the less.The younger master often visits... but today the owner was holding something in his shaking hand,  a lead.I dreaded the day I would face this ceremony,  when a god gives another god a being to guard them... my uncle failed them already and I was never taught anything about this.I became a service dog like my forefathers before me,  however several dog years had passed before I could see my first master again.He was lying down and was in pain,  he spoke two words to me which resonated in my very soul...

Good boy...
