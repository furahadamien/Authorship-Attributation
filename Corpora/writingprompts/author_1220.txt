As i read the post in question i said to myself:
"Even though i've had my fare share of internet arguments and distasteful comments both from strangers and myself on occasion, dissapointment for my rarely upvoted posts and a surprise well earned 1k karma for a shitty comment i wrote while fucking around in Color Theory class, at the end of the day the Reddit community always manages to make me smile and remind me that there are a whole funky bunch of people young and old who can make me laugh, who inspire me and overall making everyday more wholesome.....and inderectly helped me deal and beat depression a couple months after i joined the website even when i never really asked for it."Now i look back at the post i wanted to make for yesterday's me_irl advent calendar.I should've just posted it regardless of it getting 4 upvotes.All it said was: "Memes aside, i wish all of Reddit a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and a wonderful New Year.".Oh well, there's always next year.Now i go back to bed before reading another wholesome 2meirl4meirl post talking about not having a New Year's kiss and being 45 days appart from Valentine.I start thinking how in the world im gonna contact the girl i like before that happens, she told me she was gonna be working all holidays but i didnt believe her, i dont really care if we go out after the year ends but im sure as hell not telling her how i feel on Valentines (its a stupid cliche and seems pushy to do that for me at least).I jump off my bed and begin browsing Reddit again on my laptop.This site is really like a drug now that i think about it.Either way i need to look for advice here and probably do the opposite.
