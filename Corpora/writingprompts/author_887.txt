<paper rustle>


OK Uuhh<INAUDIBLE>... it is currentlyyyyyy <paper noise> 5 months and 4 days CT uh, thats calendar time, since the uhhh FIRST event.Estimated relative time experienced is approximately 15 years... uncorrected.This is my final voice log.I have been running tests since the events started happening, and feel I can conclusively state that I never had control over this phenomenon.Upon confirming the events were not brief, transient hallucinations as I had first feared, my next concern was that my research had developed temporal side effects.You will know by now many of my other working explanations proved fruitless, at least initially.Today though, I think I  I uh have a fuller picture.The fact that the events were initially very brief prevented me from gathering useable early data, it wasn't until event 246 I began cataloguing.This was the first 1-hour plus event.They started becoming erratic.Brief at times, and then far longer events, occurring side by side, sometimes within hours of each other in calendar time.By event 314, I had noted no indications during CT that the events were adversely affecting anyone else in the world.Google scrapes for event-related keywords rendered no hits.I gave up predicting patterns which may have occurred in nature, and deduced these events may be being caused intentionally.By someone else.This was also when they started increasing in duration into relative days.At this point I became aware I could no longer continue my research.On the off-chance my devices were causing or exacerbating events I couldn't risk continuing, despite my hope they may prove to be my solution.I considered coming clean.Explaining.but the university finding out would have ended my career and I had no guarantee events would continue.If Id known <inaudible, away from mic> anyway, I didn't relish the opportunity of spending months in a secure psychiatric unit during events so there's that I truly hope there is no way anyone would have believed me 


I resolved to continue passive monitoring of the phenomena and maintaining daily life as far as possible in between.My efforts to explore how far the events spread (to ensure they were not localised pocket dimensions or anomalies) began at event 587.My discovery that the events held geographically allowed me to consider further exploration.But with events extending, much of my time was spent in between cataloguing details.Given that at any point time could stop, and it could be relative weeks, or even months until I had to resume my life, I had to ensure CT continuity so as not to arouse suspicion.After event 701, the longest expedition, I realised it would be too risky to travel during any other events.Co-workers and Pamela, they were <sobbing sound Crashing noise> they noticed my appearance change.My travel exacerbated the ageing process as if my time relative to the source of the event was not constant.This is why I created my remote lab and ceased interacting with my pre-relative time contacts.My wife in particular could detect even minor changes in my physical appearance during CT days, between events.She always.Those eyes of hers 


The relative passage of time had however appeared to vary with direction.I have repurposed my devices and believe these variations can now be monitored during events.I apologise to whoever finds this recording for the pages of hand-written data, but my hands are not what they were.I estimate approximate relative ageing, accounting for both event-time and travel-related anomalies to be approximately 20 years.As the events started in my early sixties, and I have been absent medical care for much of this time, I don't I I don't have long.The batteries in my devices are depleting.In this recorder too.Mains electricity never worked during events <laughter>... Of all the anyway.I am no longer mobile enough to source food, let alone batteries.Tell Pamela I'm sorry for the worry she has experienced in the last few weeks.I just She didn't need to see me like this.Use my work.Find them.Please.<inaudible>
