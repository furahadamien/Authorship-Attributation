Sitting here watching these two brother argue reminds me of my past.I slip into a memory of a time before anything was written or there was a language besides basic grunting and pointing.To this day I can not believe my brother was Abel to do it.I close my eyes and the memories come flooding in.I had just showed him that I could sharpen this strange rock and make it sharp to hunt the animals around us.We were excited, we could feed our family.We could show Adam that we could be useful after he and mom had gotten us cast out of the garden.Then it happened I knocked a rock loose from the wall next to us and it landed on his foot.To no surprise he was upset, but this time it was different he had the sharp object.He stabbed me.Not just once but multiple times.I  closed my eyes when he did.I only opened them when the pain had stopped, and when I did I stood over my dead body as my brother wept, shaking my lifeless body.His face full of regret.Now I know what the stories say it's that I killed my brother, and the big man condemned me to wander eternally.This in a way was true as I am to walk this Earth forever, but not hopelessly roaming.I am guiding those who have died that way they will never have to experience the loneliness that I had in the earliest days.As the memory fades I focus on these two brothers fighting still.I can feel the anger rising in the room.There is hatred between the two, and not just some sort of sibling rivalry.I started becoming more aware of the situation and hearing one shout "I hate you Remus you always try to foil my plans of the city!"Remus respoded by picking up the stone tablet next to them that had the order for the next stone shipment and smashing over Romulus' head.Romulus was dead before he even hit the ground.As per usual the new soul turned directly at me."Am I dead?"Romulus asked.I just pointed to his lifeless body as Remus continued to take out his anger on his dead brother body.Romulus shook in terror as he watched his brother beat his corpse."It is time Romulus let us go to the land of Nod" I spoke calmly.
