He wasn't quite sure how much time had passed when he awoke.His head pounding, a sharp pain stung his jaw.He looked out and across the room, his cheek and head still resting on the cold hallway floor.As he went to get up, he heard a sticky sound as the drying blood peeled away from the linoleum.One of his eyes was caked in blood.They had worked him over good.But he wasn't concerned about that.He wasn't concerned about the broken hallway table, the glass on the floor, the smashed heirlooms.He steadied himself on the wall as he limped out into the open space of the dining and kitchen area.He knew when he called out.He knew he was alone.He reached for his cell phone.Even with his face mangled and his eyes forced closed from the swelling, he could dial the number by heart.It only rang a second when he heard the voice."Hello?""Is he there?"he asked the person."He was" said the voice.He pressed the end call button and dropped the phone.They took him.They took the only thing left that made this life worth living.The only thing left that she had given him.He turned now towards the stairs.His eyes had adjusted and the life had gone from them.All that was left was darkness, purpose and fury.He opened the door to the basement and slowly walked down the cold steps until he felt concrete.As he rounded the corner of the stairs, his hand moved in automation, becoming one with the object that leaned just to the left of the railing.He didn't even bother with the light.He knew exactly where to place his blow.His ears rung with the first blow, the smell of cement being pulverized filled the air.Harder he swung, never missing his mark.He pulled back the fragments of the floor and slowly lifted the case living in the hole.As he lifted the lid, a small rush of air hurried to fill the once sealed trunk.Then it hit him.The smell of oil and those little silica packets meant to remove moisture.His suit was just as he left it.He lifted it, inspected it, admired it and welcomed it like an old friend had just come home.He looked at his options.The Glock 19 series 5 with the molded grip and laser cut titanium slide, creakoted in  burnt graphite with it's vented slide, the matching Mark VIIs with custom Yankee Hill Suppressors.He'd take them all.But he saved the best for last, his custom Wilson Combat Beretta 92 with titanium SGS compensator.The free floating slide made it the most dependable firearm ever and when he ran out of bullets, it was a solid piece of steel that he could bludgeon with.He stood up, ready to leave when he saw it.The picture was almost too painful to look at, but he did.It was the last time they had been together.Then he flipped it over, the description written in blue ink said "1997 Continental Premiere - G.W.Hunting" His eyes paused as he read the next line "Thanks for all the support John, your friendship means everything - Matt"
He stood up, slowly ascended the stairs and went into the garage.His Mach 1 roared to life in the cool air, the engine devouring and compressing the cold into raw fury under the hood.His hand slammed down on the Hurst Shifter and the hunt had begun.As he passed the guard gate of his gated community, the doorman looked at him and said "Happy Hunting....Mr Wick"
