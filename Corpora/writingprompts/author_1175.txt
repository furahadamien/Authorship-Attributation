"Sirs, I don't think you understand.I have fought many a battle with this here spatula!Why, my first day on the job I must have fended off hundreds as they wore against our battlements, like waves against the coast.I died with it in my hand, as all good men do.Why do you question the validity of my chosen weapon?"he said, pacing back and forth.His shirt suddenly felt very constricting, and he pulled at his tie, trying to figure out why he felt so thirsty."Well you see.. we here in Valhalla are typically acustomed to.. a more bloody sort of weapon, a different sort of warrior.You've not killed a single man!How can you call it a weapon, yourself a warrior?"The man above him sat in a chair, surrounded by several other men who could be described as nothing other than gods among men.Toned, one might even say chisled bodies, and that certain quality about the eyes, like they could cut through you with a look."Must a man kill to be a warrior?I fought at the Bubble Bowl!I have defended The Formula time and time again!I have personally been given quests by Lord Neptune himself-" there was hurried muttering at this

"You have quested for Lord Neptune?Why was this not in the reports?"The men shuffled through their papers "Ah, here it is.. let's see.. defeated The Cyclops.. tamed the mighty Hasselhoff.. retrieved the crown, saved the town and Mr. Krabs.. why was this not brought to my attention?Hm.. Oh for Valhalla's sake!Neptune himself tried to keep this quiet, he's STILL embarassed about that whole-" he waved his hand around "lack of.. hair.Very well.You, who have fed millions, defended your 'Formula' and your home, we accept your choice of weapon.Welcome to Valhalla, Mr.Squarepants."
