Empigee
"Welcome to Spac'd!The top galactic stream dedicated to making asses out of stupid aliens!Tonight, our special guests are the Z!Coreans, a species of gentle farmers on a planet orbiting Betelgeuse who have reached a medieval level of civilization.You all know what *that* means!"An unseen audience replied enthusiastically: "SPACE THEIR ASSES!SPACE THEIR ASSES!"The scene shifted to an aerial view of a Z!Corean farming village dominated by dome-shaped huts made out of blue leaves.The Z!Coreans, a four-legged species with one giant eye on their backs and a massive mouth on their underbellies, were running around in a panic at the sight of the unmanned aerial drone doing the filming.The camera zoomed in on an small Z!Corean huddling close to a larger one, presumably its parent.The small one was emitting a mixture of clicks and bleats that even a human could recognize as a cry of distress, while the parent wrapped its prehensile, multi-pronged tail - used in place of limbs - in a gesture of protection.A bubble caption popped on the screen with the words: "Faces even a motha couldn't luv!lol"

The host continued: "They were so happy to see us that we just *had* to leave them a parting gift."The scene switched again to a nearby field, filled with blue, purple, and red vines bearing various spotted fruits.A large obelisk in the shape of a circumcised penis and covered with pictograms had been dropped in the center of the field, crushing many of the food plants.Another caption popped up reading "Theez freeks r abt to get hard!"A Z!Corean with a shock of orange hair around its eye - the only one with hair of any kind - crept up to the obelisk and studied the pictograms, emitting increasingly high-pitched clicks and bleats as it read.The host explained in a voice over "We've carved our trademarked *Spac'd* dick with a message in their language proclaiming the apocalypse!Let's see what happens!"As the orange-haired Z!Corean's translation spread through the village, despairing bleats filled the air.One Z!Corean gouged out its eye with a farming implement, while others set to attacking one another in groups.The parent Z!Corean seen earlier stabbed its child with a lamenting bleat, then proceeded to impale itself.Before long, the landscape was filled with dead Z!Coreans.A large space ship in the shape of male genitalia began to descend.When it landed, a lone human strode out.His face had been genetically engineered to form the classic troll face, with the only variation being his cybernetically enhanced eyes, which enabled him to see the entire spectrum of light and watch pornography at will.He planted a flag on the ground, once again featuring the image of male genitalia."Y'all been spaced!"he proudly announced.
