Emperor Palpatine watched in amusement, laughing, as both father and son were dueling under the throne room.He knew how it ended.He had foreseen it all since the beginning.The Jedi thought power came through knowledge and peace, but he knew better.He was cursed since his birth to witness the fate of the Universe.His curse was foresight.You cannot hide forever, Luke, said his protg Darth Vader.Such a shame Palpatine thought.He groomed Anakin since he was little to do what needed to be done no matter what was the cost.I will not fight you, replied Luke.Palpatine rose from his throne and started walking towards the duo.Foresight was a curse but also wasnt a future set in stones.He needed to know.Give yourself to the dark side.It is the only way you can save your friends.Yes, your thoughts betray you.Your feelings for them are strong.Especially for Vader paused.Palpatine stopped walking too.This was the crucial moment and Vader failed.His family feeling was too strong.Sister!So you have Darth Vader never finished the sentence has a bright red saber pierced through his head.Noooooooo, Luke screamed in anger while igniting his lightsaber.Blinding bolts of energy shoot from the Emperors hands at Luke.Using his anger, Luke tried to use to force to deflect them and was half-successful at first, but the bolts were coming with such speed and power that Lukes knees buckled and he slowly fell to the ground.Young fool ... said Palpatine.Only now, at the end, do you understand.

With both father and son dead, the Rebel Alliance will soon come to an end on Endor.It was such a shame to lose Anakin though.The Jedi, in their how perversion, thought Anakin was the chosen one but, powerful has he was, he wasnt.The chosen ones power was knowledge of the future and he saw how the galaxy ended in 50 years.His master Darth Plagueis created him out of the Force with a single goal in mind, to unite the galaxy no matter what the cost and with the rebellion now extinguished he intended to do just that.&#x200B;
