"Tell it one more time and i'll definitely go to bed, please mum" the excited child jumping up and down on her bed asked, "Ok, ok, one last story now, Lucas.." replied the redheaded woman barely capable of keeping her eyes open.Lucas always knows his mother gives in and tells another story when shes tired, as he got himself in bed, his mother grabbed a book from underneath the bed.Lucas's eyes grew excited as he saw the cover of his favorite book 'Boy who becomes Emperor'."Since the dawn of time, five universes have been intertwined with another unable to survive without the other, but each universe is missing of one of the five elements; Earth, Water, Air, Fire & Magic.Because of this everybody's path varies from which you universe your born in, the boys universe is the one without magic, the only universe which hasn't produced a Magic Emperor to rule this universe.This is the story of how a no-magic boy was capable of becoming a Magic Emperor that rivals the other five Emperors..." 

Lucas drifted off to sleep midway through the story, dreaming of tomorrow, the day he's waited for years, the day his life will forever change at the magic evaluation.
