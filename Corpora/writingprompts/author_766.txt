Once again, was I sitting there in the darkness.Hungry.Starving.The gossip was going around faster than my non-existing blood flow,.The mortals knew there were shady "people" around who would knock on the door with some poor excuse to try and enter the residence.Some lousy new-blood was captured and tortured for the secret of our brethren.The only way you could get work on the farms was if you were able to enter the house on the land.People were catching up, and more of our brethren were captured and executed.We needed to do something, so I started thinking while my stomach growled, echoing off of the walls.I needed to get invited in to be able to enter a house, that was the curse "Mr. Dest" cast upon us when he created us.The vampires don't like to write the history down, most of us can't even read or write, we are still doing it the old fashioned way.That means searching for any kind of rule book is out of the question.Once I get invited in though, I can freely walk in forever thats a fact."I wonder if animals can invite us inside?"I muttered to myself before falling into laughter."I wonder why we can enter businesses and establishments but not personal homes" I thought to myself before loudly yelling "Aha!".I started connecting the dots.All stores in town have a wooden sign that says "Welcome" or something in that variant."I wonder..." I thought before rushing outside with the biggest grin on my face.I had to test this!No way it could be this simple.It couldn't be, right?I ran straight towards the salesman of the town, he was a human but he was an ally, getting paid by the vampires for insider information.He didn't care much about us, his eyes only saw gold.In a way we weren't that much different, he would hurt and scam people for gold, we would hurt people for blood.Ah blood, just the thought of it makes me go mad.I arrived at the store of the salesman."Hiya, Darren!"I said as my eyes suddenly locked on that one particular blue vein that was sticking out in his neck as if it was the head of a deer that just heard something making a noise in the woods."You up for making some gold?"I asked while scanning through his items, "Im looking for something people in the town all need.Something like a rocking chair for a porch, or someth..." I didn't even finish my sentence, because I had found it.I pointed my finger at the pile of empty brown doormats."PERFECT" I grasped out of happiness."Whats with the strange behaviour?"said Darren.I looked at him like I could murder him at that instance.I want you to paint all these mats with the word "Welcome", use white paint so it's easy to read and make the letters big.I threw a bag of gold on the counter and started waiting.An hour later he was done, still with a question mark on his face."I still don't understand why you wanted me to do this."he said as he sighed out of relief that he was done."Shhhh, no questions" I say as I giggle like a little school girl while cracking my fingers."Any customers who come in, try to sell them mats for a cheap price, you better get a list of the persons names who buy them and more of those bags will appear" He obeyed like the good little human he was.The following day I went back there, feeling as ill as a dog who didn't eat anything for weeks.As if maggots were eating me from the inside out, the pain was unbearable."Got the list for you, we sold out all of them".That gave me an adrenaline rush, as if I was a mortal kid again who just found a toy collection.I rushed out of there and checked the first name on the list.As it was a small town, everyone knew each other by name so that shouldn't be a problem.He lived fairly close so I rushed there.I noticed the welcome mat, even went up and stood on it, knocking on the door at the same time."Hiya!James" I said."I was close and was pretty thirsty, mind if I come in for a glass of water?".He opened the door but didn't invite me in, he waited for me to enter.I slowly lifted my foot and tried to step inside, and it worked."IT WORKED!"I thought to myself.Making it hard for me not to laugh maniacally.It worked
