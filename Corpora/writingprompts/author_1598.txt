A peaceful end.A wonderfully average life, with slightly more good times than bad.Its time to walk through the tunnel of light.The end of the tunnel glows all around me, bright, hot, but pleasant.I open my eyes...Wait!Hold up!Wait, was I dreaming?Theres a Savannah around me.Did they landscape Central Park?Why am I naked?When did I get here?Why can't I see anyone else?What was I dreaming about?Damn, my breath stinks, I need to brush.What was my dream about?What did I see?My dream fades away like my breath on a cold night.Meh...It was probably about cave paintings or some other shit anyway.Now, its time to smash!!edit: spellings.
