     Patient: I swear to fucking God.I woke up after telling the kid to write Santa and there's a damned fucking Ponyta in my front yard.No, I shit you not.It was not a hallucination.There was this tag tied to its halter saying to feed it the souls of starving, angry, abused, or angry children, and only children.There were fucking directions on how to extract and prepare them.Why would I imagine this shit?It's hell!It ruined our front yard!Well, for starters, it left scorch marks instead of hoofprints on the lawn.Not to mention it ate the rose bushes.How fucked up it that?It left the flowers and ate the fucking thorns and stems.Well of course my daughter loves it.Name?Fuck.I don't know.I think it was Princess Sparkle Pants.No I don't want to try and get to know the devil spawn known as Princess Sparkle Pants.Because the fucking devil sent it!?How am I gonna deal with this?Well for starters send my kid to a tutor to teach her how to spell for second I'm gonna tell her Santa isn't real and Satan is trying to buy her soul through the eyes of the flaming goddamned pony.I don't care if she's only seven she's been in contact with the devil she can handle Santa not being real.Honestly, Barb, I don't give a flying fuck.Sorry, Doctor Shrinky Dink Barbara.Well I'm gonna deal with it by getting the thing back to Satan.I'll ask Amanda to write him again and say thanks but no thanks.Man, I don't know if hell would be so bad iF SATAN GAVE MY FUCKING KID A FUCKING FLAMING ASS PONY

"Maybe we should send our kid somewhere to learn how to spell better.""PS - There were burnt hoofprints in the back of the building.The kid says Princess Sparkle Pants didn't like her dad's attitude.She doesn't seem too broken up about his death."
