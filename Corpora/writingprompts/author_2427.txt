Bounce.The sharp ring of the brass casing on the ground sounds through the warehouse.A piercing note.A prelude to the end of this scene.It doesn't matter how many people he saved.How many situations he resolved.The moment his grizzled hands had extinguished life, his name entered my book.Bounce.The pulse of a moment in time.He regretted it.All the news stations caught that and it wasn't something he could hide.If he had just accepted his fate, instead of acting on instinct, that family wouldn't be another face on a memorial.Heros don't kill.Bounce.The body finally hits the floor.Nary a heartbeat had passed.Another one was gone.Another name to cross off.The evidence was ready, pointing to a gang attack overpowering him.People would say it was just bad luck again.This was a hard city for heros after all.Bounce.No one knows, but my name is Bad Luck.I'm not a hero.
