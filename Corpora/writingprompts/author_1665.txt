I love chicken.My grandma had this ancient cookbook, full of amazing recipes for making the best damn chicken you've ever tasted.Before she passed away, she whispered into my ear "Gunther, whatever you do, don't touch my tomes."Those were her last words.I was lucky enough to have learned how to read from her.Both my parents were taken by The Black Death.I think that's what took Grandma, too.One lethargic day I start going through heirlooms, and I stumbled upon a book with dust an inch thick.I removed it very carefully from a nook in our shack.It was about this time I started getting hungry.Thankfully, I had planned ahead and cut the chicken's head off last night.This chicken's really do run around for a bit, as if they're possessed by some evil spirit.Anyways, I blew the dust off the cover of the book and saw

 "Ye Olde Butcher: A Guide to Preparing Meat the Right Way"

A strange coincidence, but a welcome one.I flipped through the pages and heard sounds, terrible sounds.I still get chills thinking about it to this day.I pray I never here anything like that ever again, in this world or any other.I find a dish a simpleton peasant could make, and I start to read.At first, it seems normal.Chicken breast
Water 
Herbs and Spices for flavor 

But then it gets weird.I'm reading all of this out loud, because that's how grandma reads her books."Eye of Newt"
"Wormwood"
"Pearl of Swine "

"And a hint of potion number 66"

66...that sounded evil to me.And I should have stopped there.But the damage was already done.As I read each ingredient, they started to fly around the room and into the cauldron.What was in the pot before, I'll never know.But I do know what came out of the pot.A massive Chicken, 8 feet tall, red eyes, and talons that would pierce armor.A fearsome beast.Possessed by a demon.I quickly stopped reading aloud and started to freestyle.I'd seen grandma do this a few times."Oh foul demon, go back to the pits of hell from whence ye came "

The demon lost control of the body.A massive chicken fell to the ground, perfectly cooked.There was even Chicken Nuggets!But my work here wasn't over."NEVER COME BACK TO THIS DOMAIN, OR ENTER THIS REALM WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE POPE, EVER AGAIN! "I slumped down to the ground, exhausted.I summoned my remaining strength and forced myself to eat a nugget.And let me tell you this, before you stop reading.Those nuggets were the shit.
