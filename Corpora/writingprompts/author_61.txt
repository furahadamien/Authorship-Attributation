"Good luck Mr.Bond", Elon said, closing the door of the Roadster.Bond sat, trapped in the suit.It was extremely stiff, he struggled to move the suit at all.Designed so nobody would know he was inside.The car was loaded into the faring.Darkness set in around him.Bond knew he had only a few hours before the launch.But James had an idea.He struggled for the next few hours to ease open the suit - his only chance of survival in space.As the countdown started he had managed to remove the knife from his jacket pocket.Bingo.And then, explosions.James tool one last deep breath as the rocket began it's acceleration.Then he ripped open the suit.And got into the passenger seat.Slowly but surely, he worked his way down the rocket, past the mid engine, through the separation stack and on top of the middle stage booster.He felt the throttle ease off.His plan was working.Then, unable to hold his breath any longer, he blacked out.The stage separated, and the faring was removed.Nobody noticed the torn side of the spacesuit, not even Musk himself.The rocket continued on its way, while the main booster continued onwards to the drone ship in the Mid Atlantic, before unexpectedly running out of fuel, crashing into the ocean.That evening, a confused Elon looked over the crash data.All was in order, the only explanation was that the booster was about 92kg heavier than expected.It was now so obvious."Thanks for the ride, Elon", James said to the amazed Musk.Elon turned around slowly."Although, the lack of bar service was slightly disappointing"
