Eager_Question
"Daddy!Daddy daddy daddy!"Valerie squealed with delight."Daddy, I found you!"A smile forced itself onto my face, and worries about the office vanished from my mind.My six-year-old daughter nearly tackled me, and I managed to swing her up into a hug."Did you, now?"I asked, as though it was the most fascinating thing a human being had ever said."I did!I found you on the old internet!"Valerie had found out the internet archives existed two days earlier, and spent hours asking her grandmother to look things up on it from various years."Oh?And what did you find out?"I asked, expecting a graduation photo, or my disssertation or something."You're a supervillain!"I laughed, guessing she'd found photos from halloween in my university days."Am I?"She nodded, her face serious and determined, as though she had found the missing piece in a great conspiracy.I put her down, and she dragged me off to the computer where the page was open.Then my heart nearly stopped.I stared at my own face, in handcuffs, being taken into custody in a photograph.The article was eight years old.I stared aghast long enough that Valerie started to poke me in the shoulder."Daddy?Daddy?Daaad....?"It was tugging on my sleeve that got me out of my stupor."Wow!"I said, faking the grin that had pulled me like gravity a mere minute earlier."That's amazing!Did you find anything about mommy?"She shook her head and took it as a challenge, running off screaming "grandmaaaaaa" up the stairs.I continued to stare at the screen.Eight years.One year before I got married.Three years after my dissertation.I wracked my brain trying to figure it out.Stories from that day were mostly the same: "Eco-terrorist caught and sent to rehabilitation facility"."Supervillain Dr. Mycellium finally stopped"."Rehabilitation facility to host Derek Ita for his crimes against humanity".All I could remember from that year was... the lab work.Racks and racks and racks of tubes, isolating spores.... nothing else.And yet there I was on the screen, looking like a lunatic.I stared, scrolled and clicked until Valerie came again."Daddy, will you read me Plant Adventures?"I glanced away to see that somehow, the afternoon had turned into night, and she had put on her pyjamas."Of course, sweetie."I read her one short book about invasive species (what, you expect a mycologist not to indoctrinate his children?)and returned to the screen after she was sound asleep.I read about "my" escapades with a morbid fascination.Genetically altered fungi overtaking coal mines, fungal spores designed to destroy the brain of any human who inhaled them, a mold that sealed shut every exit of the White House...

Of course, these were all things I thought about doing, once or twice.In my more... radical moments, perhaps.But I would never do that.I was too... reasonable.The word echoed in my mind for a moment, as a strange sense of unease crept into me.Reasonable.Reasonable."*Don't worry, sir.By the time I'm done with him, he'll be a productive member of society.You won't be able to find a citizen more reasonable.*"

I remembered struggling.I remembered the pain of the restraints against my wrists and ankles, the taste of pennies in my mouth, the stinging pain as a hand pressed itself against the back of my head, reasonable, the strange feeling of tension and release as something--as someone--prodded my mind like a specimen.My throat tightened, as something in my head resisted.I was just imagining things, I thought.I had to be reasonable.I touched the back of my head, and sure enough, there was a tiny scar there.One I had somehow never noticed my entire life.I served myself a glass of vodka.I was starting to feel it when my wife came in."Sorry I'm late, I swear I--Derek?Honey, you look like you've seen a ghost!"I stared at her as my thoughts felt like running on mud."I... did you know?""Have you been drinking?""Did you know, Durga?""Sit down--what's going on?"I turned the screen to her and asked again."Did you know!?"She looked at me with a laugh."What's this?Some sort of prank?"She didn't know."I have to go," I said."Honey, you're drunk--" 

"I have to go."I grabbed my coat and stalked off into the winter wind.I didn't drive, and there was nothing but suburbia for miles, so mostly I just walked.I walked and walked until I found a bench, swiped away the snow, and sat there to rest my legs.The cold helped.Waiting through indifferent winds as the snow slowly layered itself atop me, my mind spun.After an hour, I got back home.Durga had changed her clothes, and stared at me as I stepped back in."What's going on?"She asked.She'd read the articles too.I sighed."I don't know."One question kept spinning inside my mind that night as I failed to sleep.Did they take away my superpower too?Or had I been too busy living the life to notice?I stared at my *Panellus stipticus* for some time, wondering.I can't explain it, but I got the distinct impression that my mushroom was bowing to me.
