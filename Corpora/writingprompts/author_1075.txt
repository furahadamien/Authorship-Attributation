It all started around age 12, I was blowing out my birthday candles and noticed some lines appearing on the ground I wondered what they meant but I wanted cake more then following some stupid lines.Well the next day I started off on the green line and really didn't look back and everything has been great.I now have a wife and kids with a steady job working as CEO of Microsoft.That Bill gates guy died and I took his spot as the new CEO.Now while it did seem weird that the green line led to a path where someone died for me to take their place but I figured it was fine.Well I decided I was getting bored following this green line and wanted to try out this red line that was always there but I never followed it.So the next morning after getting home I decided "Lets try red today."Which of course seemed no different from green It was just a normal day but then it hit me  and I mean a truck hit me and knocked me out.I was rushed to the hospital with 3 fractured ribs a sprained ankle and a severe concussion.As I awoke 3 days after the accident I couldn't really remember much of what happened all I could remember was that truck heading towards me had no one in it which was weird but maybe it's this concussion causing my memory to be wrong.Some people come into my room and are so happy to see me OK and I ask them "Who are you people."To which they freaked out but were told before they came in that they were my wife and kids."Hey honey I am so glad that your OK me and the kids got you a balloon and a card."The oldest looking girl hands me the balloon and card.I read over it and it's nice but I don't feel anything since I can't remember who these people are.I ask if they could please leave the room cause I need to catch my thoughts.They understand and wait in the waiting rooms down the hall.I call the doctor in to check on me again cause maybe they missed something."Hey doc I can't remember who these people are they say they are my wife and kids but I have no idea who they are.The doctor checks off on his clipboard a couple of things and says I might have Retrograde Amnesia, and wants me to get an MRI to see if there might be some inflammation in the brain that might be causing this.So they take me down the hall and I notice this red line below the bed and wonder where it leads but I notice a green line down near my Supposed wife and kids which is weird.So I ask the doctor "Hello doc what are those lines on the ground one red and one green.The doctor quickly turns to me and says "What lines I don't see any, wow that crash must have done some real damage."At first I thought he was telling the truth and as we get into the MRI room I get put onto the MRI bed and put in the machine.I see that they doctors are talking and one doctor walks in and starts yelling at the the Doctor who is taking care of me and they argue for a good minute or two.I can't really tell what they're walking about but they keep looking over at me and then pointing at their heads.I'm done with the scan and taken out of the room and put back in my room.I see the lines again leading to the outside and wonder what they are.So I follow the green one to see who these people really are.I make it down the hall following the green and then the doctor comes and gets me and the green fades but the red is leading back to my room.The doctor takes me into the janitors closet and starts talking fast and nervously."What happened out there on the road why were you following the red line, you idiot."I knew he was lying about the lines cause it seemed like he was following them perfectly.He hands me his glasses and tells me to put them on and there are some cool little switches on the side."Put these on and you will understand what those lines mean."I put the glasses and he starts changing some switches on the side and I can now see other peoples lines, and a lot of red lines lead to a room in the restricted zone and the greens lead to the outside.The doctor tells me that him and some of his colleagues have created a way to see peoples Paths of Great, Reward, Eventually, End, then Nothing, Risk, Eventually, Death.The Doctor tells me "That people can follow the green lines for a nice and easy life but nothing will come of it while the red line has risk and eventually leads to your death, but you can make a difference but you have to die young."As I sit there thinking about all the possibilities if everyone took red the world would be a weird place while people take risk and do it for the greater good.The door to the room is soon whipped open and that Angry doctor grabs the doctor and takes him out and I slip the glasses into the trash while I go back to my room following the red line from now on.I sit there waiting for a doctor to come back and tell me when I can leave.The angry doctor from before comes to confront me about the glasses and asks where they are I tell him "I don't know what your talking about, can I leave yet."The doctor says I can but first, as he writes me a prescription for some Vicodin."Here you go your gonna need it for those ribs and ankle."I take the prescription put my clothes on that my Wife had brought me and walk out the door.They great me and ask me if I remember who I am and they wait while I think about it and notice on my wrist it says Arch Michael Angel."Arch Michael Angel, is my name and the kids and my wife are so happy but I tell them I need to get something first before we leave so I follow the red line over to the janitors closet and dig through the trash and get the Glasses and put them on.I can see that my family is following red lines also.I walk up to the Pharmacy to get my prescription and I read on the bottom that the Doctors name is Louis Ethan Fire which is weird cause it sounds like Luci... here is your Prescription Mr. Michael Thank you and I want to say his name so I look at his name tag and it reads Beel Zed Bub Thank you is it Mr. Beel."Uh yes that is my name your welcome."And as we walk out of the Hospital I see that it's address is 6666 Nine Circle Lane.With smoke always billowing out of it like something is always on fire.:The rest is up to your imagination:
