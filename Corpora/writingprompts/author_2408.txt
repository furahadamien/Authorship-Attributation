The dynasty lasted for 500 years.And for that entire time, we kept the peace.An endless chain of second sons, married to our service.And I, I have risen through the ranks to be their commander.I have put down rebellions.I have slaughtered babies in cradles.I have burned harvests and razed villages and salted the earth behind me.I have carried out the will of the Emperor and the Empress before him.I believed I would carry out the will of the next Emperor as well, though perhaps that is no longer certain.The rebellions gained in frequency.The harder we came to crush, the faster they rose again.At court, they say that had the Emperor heeded the wisdom of the old counselor he inherited with his throne, we would not be in this predicament.Maybe that's true.We'll never know.At the Emperor's orders, I killed the old man in his sleep.And then I sent a detachment to kill his family.His oldest grandson escaped the slaughter.But the family's lands and wealth were seized.All he had left was his grief and his tainted name.I asked permission to hunt him down.Grief and a tainted name so easily turn to a vengeful grudge.I knew that this man would come back to haunt my Emperor.But the permission was not granted.So we put down uprising after uprising.Sometimes I met the leaders in combat.Sometimes I didn't.More and more often, I heard a name at these leaders' lips.The name of the grandson.I decided I had to find him.It turned out, I did not have to look far: he had infiltrated the palace, posing as a stablehand.And, as one might expect from a man who has led a rebellion from hiding, he himself was careful and perceptive.He knew he'd been found about as soon as I did and he put his plans in motion.He sabotaged the Emperor's saddle, causing him to fall from his horse when we rode into an ambush.My soldiers did what they could to protect our fallen leader, but they were out-numbered.I was holding him, the grandson of the dead and attainted counselor, in custody when word came that the Emperor had been killed.He looked into my eyes and smiled.I looked into his eyes and did the same.Then I pointed the pistol at his head and pulled the trigger.And thus both the rebellion and the Emperor died on the same day.The Emperor died without issue.His wife produced two stillborn girls before she died in childbed.The son she bore that day lived two weeks before following his mother into the afterworld.He had a sister, who was married off to form an alliance.She is leading an army now, come to claim her brother's empty throne.But I am already here, and the Emperor's surviving counselors and our own army has deemed me fit to take up the crown.And so, in the name of keeping the peace, I will.
