I'd never been around a real gun before.All the movies in the world don't prepare you for the real thing.The explosion.The force.I would quickly forget about being shocked by the gun.My wallet, shrieking in pain, flickered and transformed into a black mess of tentacles."Nasty fuckers," the man said.His words were a million miles away."Get behind me."I couldn't speak.The tentacles writhed on the pavement.A black vapor surrounded the creature, and faded as the twitching slowed.I noticed his uniform.Faded blue with black accents that stretched across his chest and legs.He reached for a button on his collar."Confirmed contact in Auburn.Seattle containment has been breached."Static, followed by a grainy response."Roger that, expanding zone.Continue scanning for <inaudible> material and engage as appropriate.Dispatching a unit <inaudible> and rendezvous at 0900."His attention turned back to me."We're moving.You have any family in the area?"Family.Family.My senses snapped back."Oh God, I need to call my wife."I pulled my phone from my back pocket.As I fumbled to enter my passcode, the man slapped it out of my hand.Three more shots rung out.I guess you get desensitized pretty quickly, because my reaction was very different this time."What the fuck are you doing?!"I yelled and took two steps back.The man stared down.My phone was destroyed.The battery began sparking and a flame erupted.He waited, then side eyed me."Huh, guess that was your phone.You can use mine."An explosion rocked the city as we made our way back to the street.I fumbled with the phone and my memory as I tried to recall her number.The man's collar spoke again."Hold position, your ride is inbound."A large APC turned the corner, screeching to a halt in front of us.The rear doors flung open and a man and woman armed with rifles jumped out to cover us as we got in.I caught a brief glimpse of the lettering stenciled on the right door.-NSTAR

The man talked to the others."Only his wallet.All other scans were clear.I also... checked his phone.Any other reports?"The woman spoke, "We just got word.They're all over.Bravo engaged three phantoms a neighborhood over."They continued to speak.Words I had never heard before.It all sounded insane.And it distracted me from the fact that my wife's phone wasn't ringing."I need to get home, and you need to tell me what's happening," I said.It came out far more forcefully than I had intended.The man from the alley looked over to me."Welcome to the Typhon Containment Team.Let's go get your wife."
