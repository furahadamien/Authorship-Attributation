First, I went to all my worst moments.And it kept happening - "Why was there no choice here?"Maybe half the time I had a choice about it, but about as often, the most recent choice could not have predictably led to this horrible moment, and yet I was stuck with it.I had no option not to be dismissive of Michael.I had no option not to be overbearing towards Ann.It didn't seem fair.It got better about that towards the end, at least.Then I looked at all my best moments.Again it kept happening - I usually just did it without it being a choice at all.I just did it.Actually, here it was more often.I would have a choice about something not all that relevant to the great thing I'm about to do.Choose to stay in my dorm room and play a game, which changes when I'm walking down the path and boom no choice I'm saving that professor with the heart condition.Choose to walk out on that dumb movie, and with no more choices I end up talking Ellie out of suicide (not that I knew it was THAT important to her without reading the other branch of that choice).And those choices - they were so trivial-seeming.You hardly ever had enough information to really decide one way or another.Why not make it based on skill?Then if you're better or worse at it, you'd do

I realized what made the choices - things I was actually on the fence about.Things where I couldn't decide, and didn't see one thing as better.If I could see one side as being better, I'd just do that thing.The sections with no choice were just who I was.
