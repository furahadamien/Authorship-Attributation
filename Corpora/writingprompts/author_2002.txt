I used to have a name.A name that does not evoke fear into people's minds.It has been so long since I thought about the days before my wool-braided clothes that have now dilapidated and unwoven into what more resembles a cloak.So long since I felt physical touch with my *skin* which has now completely atrophied and eroded back, leaving ashen bones.So long since a dead man willingly walked with me and I mean *actually* walked with me, instead of just simply running away at the sight of my cracked skull.A couple of millennia traveling between the world of the living to the absolute nothingness you humans call "death" will do that to you.The dark fog and murky haze which seemingly manifests itself into flickering serpentine tongues have long been lapping at my body turning what use to be colored shaggy white to deep onyx black.No man understands why I walk with the dead and if a man actually walked with me, they'd understand.Because I would tell them my whole story.About how I used to carry a shepherds staff instead of wielding a sickle.About how I loved my parents.About how my brother bashed me over the head with a rock.About how mortals cursed me with many misnomers: The Grim Reaper, Soul Collector, Hades, La Muerte, Shinigami.About how my real name is Abel.About how lonely I get here in Death.EDIT: My first writing prompt!Please be gentle!EDIT II: Cant stop obsessing over and trying to improve syntax and diction.
