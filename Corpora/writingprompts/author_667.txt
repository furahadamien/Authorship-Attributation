Realising was the first step.Understanding was, and is now a never ending truth that life was designed to be as repetitive as free to air tv.Looking back at the past 53 years, I was untouchable.My confidence relied on my first encounter with a pharmacist.He believed he was selling life to those who werent eligible for an eternity of peace.The world spoke more than I would ever appreciate, and its as they say - the little things count.My friend Sam had been against taking the forbidden fruit and I wish him as he did me.Now I look and realise the mistake, lust for a girl named Sara and a never ending life let me dream of possibilities.Now while I sit in my skin listening to Nirvana bathed in the endless decay, I know, Samsra.
