Contrary to popular belief, purgatory isnt some dark room or blinding light rail station to nowhere.There are people here.Hundreds of thousands of people spanning thousands of years and a multitude of cultures.It takes most by surprise when they wake up here.Took me by surprise for sure.All the common tropes of purgatory still exist, people coming and going as they are judged and found either worthy of the next step or not, endless waiting with seemingly nothing to do, impending sense of doom over you past actions all of that good stuff.Here is the catch though, your adjudicators arent some impersonal god, angels, or other all-powerful beings.Its your fellow man.Specifically, the person you were most cruel to, the person you were nicest to, the person who was saved by your actions, and the person who died because of your actions.How specific people are chosen if you saved or killed a lot of people are a mystery to us here in purgatory.Its not all bad though.A massive city sprawls as far as you can see.Towering works of millions of individuals with nothing to do but plenty of time do it in.Sights that would put MC Escher to shame because of all the hands that have shaped this city.We call it Limbo, a bit on the nose, I know, but better other names that have been suggested.You may be asking yourself, why are there so many people?It seems so simple, you die, you wait for your judges to do the same and then you move on.Right?Well there is the catch What happens when the person selected to adjudicate you wasnt born until 200 years after your death?How does that happen?You poisoned the earth, you created the next super bug, your seemingly in consequential actions added up to the death of thousands well after your life time, take your pick.It happens all the time.Most of us realize that this system is utterly broken and try to find something to do with our time.Some of the more sanctimonious among us fall back hard upon their doctrine of choice and try to justify what they are experiencing.Those unsavory characters in life found their talents useless here, for if you kill someone, they just wake back up soon after.Others of us try to carve out a life and give our stay in Limbo some sort of meaning.This is where I fit in.Im not trying to find meaning myself, but I help those who need meaning find it.You see, there is a bit of a loophole here in Limbo.While we dont know exactly how it works, as I said before, we do know we can influence who our adjudicators are.Its not a science, it has no set rules other than the four judges must be someone you knew and have cause to fit into the categories for judgement.I connect these dots, help these poor souls move on from Limbo to the next stage, for better our worse.It is my penance for the actions of my life.I deserved much worse for the actions I performed.So young woken one, tell me who you have wronged, who you have cherished, who you have hurt, who you have saved, and those you have killed.Let us see if we cant move you to the next step of your journey.___
