AO#5 consists of AO#5-1 (the moon), AO#5-2 (the viewer), and AO#5-3 (the Miolinian).AO#5-1 is the moon of Korinth.When AO#5-1 is directly or indirectly viewed by any sapient being the viewer, hereby referred to as AO#5-2, enters a catatonic state for approximately 3.25 hours.After waking up AO#5-2 will quickly notice that they are not the only conscience in their head.That is to say AO#5-2 will have two consciences in their head, one that is theirs, and one that is distinctly not theirs.The second conscience will be referred to as AO#5-3, AO#5-3 referrers to itself as a Miolinian, a previously undiscovered alien species.Over the course of the next six months AO#5-3 will slowly eat away at the mind of AO#5-2, starting with the memory of looking at the moon.Eventually AO#5-2's mind will erode so far that AO#5-3 becomes the dominant conscience inhabiting AO#5-2's body.Once AO#5-3 becomes the dominant conscience in AO#5-2's body AO#5-3 will try to wreak as much havoc as possible on the surrounding population by spreading itself person to person and generally terrorizing people.___
