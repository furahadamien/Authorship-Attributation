The Blue Leopard crept through the abandoned factory, leaping from rafter to rafter, making sure to stay in the shadows.He took out the two guards at the gate with little trouble, even though the assault rifles caught him off guard.He expected the building to be crawling with Mayhem Minions using the standard chaos gauntlets, but all was quiet.This isnt Mr. Mayhems style.It had been 39 hours since Mr. Mayhem kidnapped the rest of the City Squad.In the battle, Blue Leopard was thrown off the ledge and disappeared into the waterfall.He assumed Mayhem wrote him off as dead, but while the fall knocked him out, a fly fishing tourist was downstream, and pulled him out of the river.Lucky break, he might have started with nine lives, but he must be down six or seven by now.Finally reaching the sub-basement, Blue Leopard found himself in a dark corridor.He could smell blood.As he walked forward, he felt something slick under his foot.Reaching out to the corridor wall, he felt a smooth surface that ended with a riveted metal frame.He recognized the materials.Mayhem had put him in a similar cage back during the Armageddon Crisis.He felt around for the control panel, and hit a button.Lighting up the interior of the cage.Blue Leopard stood there in shock for what felt like an eternity, frozen in terror until he finally fell to his knees, hunched over and threw up.The outside of the cell as smeared in blood and bits of brain, but that wasnt what upset the Azure Acrobat.Inside the cell was King Metal, or what was left of him.His face and chest were sloughed off, plastic tanks of sulfuric acid empty on the floor.From what he could see, only King Metals skin was metal.Underneath, he was flesh, and bone, and organs.Blue Leopard could see some of each.On the floor, beneath the Cobalt Cat, and just under hit puddle of vomit was the blood, and drag marks leading to the right.Barely able to compose himself to stand, Blue Leopard Fuel his limbs with righteous fury, and followed the drag marks to the next cell.Taking a deep breath, he turned on the light in the next cell.Inside, Machine-Man was laying in pieces.An acetylene torch and jaws of life used to tear his body apart, and there, in his open chest cavity, a his brain sat in a tank of fluid.The tank was half empty, thanks to the railroad spikes driven through the carbonite glass and into his old friends brain.Mayhem!How could he?This was beyond the pale.He was a villain, but he never mutilated a prisoner like this.Why even broadcast a ransom video?This wasnt just evil.This was sick.Blue Leopard looked further down the hall, the bloody drag marks continued into the dark, but he was terrified to check the next cell.He desperately hoped this nightmare would end, but he wasnt waking up.With every fiber of his being, he willed it not to be real.Please dont let her be here.Please, please, no.Shooting Star.Blue Leopard couldnt remember if he started sobbing before or after he turned on the cell light, but he was now.No bottles of acid, no torches or nails, Just Shooting Star, just Jenny, tied to a chair in the middle of the cell, with two bullet holes through her sequined chest emblem.Her mouth hung agape, her lifeless eyes unfocused.A pool of blood beneath the chair.Just two bullets, and shes gone.Blue Leopard, no... Gary Wilkins felt a rage unlike anything hed known.He had never wanted to do terrible bodily harm to someone before, but Mr. Mayhem had crossed every line.He didnt want to arrest him, he didnt want to beat him up, he wanted to tear off strips of his skin and feed them through his stupid M shaped mask.Gary wasnt a superhero anymore, he was just shattered, and angry, and filled with Malice.He followed the bloody drag marks to the last cell and turned on  the light.Slumped on the floor was a man in a red and black suit.A broken M shaped mask affixed to the part of his head that wasnt missing.Close range shotgun to the back of the head.Mr. Mayhem was already dead.Gary pounded his fist against the glass, robbed of his revenge.What other superhero got here first?Gunmetal Vigilante?Shotgun Bob?Who did this?Why leave all of his dead friends here for him to find?What the FUCK HAPPENED HERE?Gary didnt even register the sound before the shock set in.Red spray splattered the cell window just before he felt his back give out and he hit the floor.Someone walked up to him from behind and turned him over, or at least most of his torso.A man in black tactical armor holding an assault shotgun stood over him.The gun leveled at his chest.What is that?8? the man said looking down at Blue Leopard.Who Who are you? Gary choked out.He could feel the sapphire panthers magic starting to bring him back.Judging by the mans eyes, he could see it too.Im William. said William.Boom.Boom.Boom.William waited to make sure the blue glow didnt come again.Nope.Just human hamburger meat all over the floor.That must have been all 9 lives.It took him 5 years working for Mr. Mayhem to find the right time.That red-caped nutjob never saw it coming.Shotgun to the back of the head.Done.The rest of the City Squad tried to talk to William, tried to understand why.He killed them all in silence, he knew their weaknesses.Hed worked for Mayhem long enough to learn.Finally!No monologues, no elaborate torture devices, just solving the problem.If all supers are this dumb, this will be a piece of cake.
