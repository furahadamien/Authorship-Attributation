"How're things going with Magic Mike, then?"Kate feigned a smile over a glass of Shiraz."It's been tough this last week or so.He's not making it easy."She supped the wine while Candice feigned a grimace.It was part of their weekly ritual: every Thursday after work, the Oak Cellar, two glasses of the good stuff to herald in the weekend.It wasn't always Kate moaning about men, but Candice was a good listener."I think he's rebounding.He seems to talk about this ex of his all the time.""Oh dear," Candice frowned, the corners of her eyes creasing sympathetically."Not another one!""Yep, though unlike Frankie he doesn't look to me for sympathy," Kate sighed."And this guy's ex isn't Powered.Small mercies, eh?""But you've been seeing Mike for three months, right?""Nine weeks yesterday.""So you're trying to make a run of it?"Candice smiled."My husband and I struggled for the first three years.We broke up once.But that time apart made me appreciate how we were stronger together."Kate grimaced, sipping the Shiraz as Candice went into her spiel.The two had only met nine months ago, shortly after Kate's horrendous picnic date with Ollie: Candice took a temp vacancy in the typing pool, and their compatible senses of humour took care of the rest.However, she did like to go on her sandbox every so often.Politics, music, Powered rights, the HR team, and men.Kate liked listening but sometimes it was too much.She didn't like feeling like that."Let me interrupt," Katie said, raising her hand."Are you about to bring up Jack?"Candice scoffed."Mind if I state the obvious?You're not quite over that guy.""He was before your time.You never met him.""And yet you still seem to measure all these new guys against him.""I want to move on, Candice," Kate said simply."That was a year of my life I lost to him.I can't return back there."Candice wasn't smiling any more."You keep seeing guys that remind you of him.What draws you to them?""No idea," Kate said airily."Maybe it's me.""Maybe it's bad luck," Candice said, presenting a strained smile."Remember that picnic date with that one guy?""Ollie?He was sweet.""Except his dress sense reminded you of Jack?""He wore a shirt identical to one I got Jack for his birthday," Kate flinched."But it wasn't that.There were two Powereds having an argument not too far away.The Elemental woman kept on drawing down lightning, so we had to get to safety.But that wasn't before the hallucinations.""She was fighting a Sensory Manipulator?"Kate sighed."See, this is the thing.When they subsided, Ollie was a little *too* calm.That was the unsettling thing.He said later he had Powereds in his family, but it sounded fake.""You think he was Powered himself?""It crossed my mind later.I couldn't take that risk, not after a certain *other* Illusionist.No offence, Candice.""None taken."Kate had remembered Candice disclosing her eighteen month-old niece tested positive for the mutation.She tried not being prejudiced, but having experienced Jack and his manipulations, she didn't want to experience it again.Candice smiled, in her stilted way."My brother's making his peace with it.We're not sure what she'll be.""She'll be your niece," Kate said simply."They're still people, but we treat them differently.One thing I remember about Jack... he didn't have a normal childhood."Candice paused in reflection."Did he love you?""Jack only loved himself.""Maybe he didn't know any different.""Not my problem any more," Kate sighed."Maybe I'll give Mike some slack.He's doing his best.""Good girl," Candice grinned, before pointing at Kate's near-empty glass."One more?""No, I'd best get my train," Kate said."I want to get on top of my laundry before Mike comes round for the weekend."Kate smiled and made some idle chatter as she pulled on her coat.It was normal for her to leave a little earlier than Candice, who was within taxi distance from the Oak Cellar.An informal agreement to meet again next week, same place.Kate pulled her coat together and embraced the rain.***
 
Candice slowly drank her Malbec and watched the rain trickle down.These conversations gave her plenty to think about.A waiter came over, as she idly scratched her swelling beard."Anything else for you, sir?""No, thank you," Jack said, letting his illusion subside."I have to settle my tab."
