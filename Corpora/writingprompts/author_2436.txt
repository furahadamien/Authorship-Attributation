I've lost countless friends over the years to that damned MI6 agent.From what my sources have told me, they all made the same mistake: They didn't kill him when they had the chance.Oh, some of the more elaborate attempts made me laugh, like they time they tried to kill him on a train and make it look "politically embarrassing for the British."The most infuriating was that gold-obsessed Latvian who had him tied to a table with a laser ready to slice the agent in half.The moron took the agent off the table!What drugs are you on to even consider doing that?I guess if you want something done right, you do it yourself.I had stolen a nuclear bomb from NATO aircraft based in the UK.My terms were simple enough: $5 billion USD in gold bullion in exchange for not destroying a major American city.Sure enough, that over-sexed Brit arrived in my target city: Cleveland.One of my agents was playing informant and it was she who had made sure that MI6 sent their best man to Cleveland.After that, the rest was easy.She arranged a meeting place.I arranged a sniper.My "informant" led the agent to the desired location and BANG!Job's done.Frankly, I'm embarrassed at how many of my friends I've lost to him.That was one of the easiest assassinations I'd ever arranged.Of course, my "informant" was also carrying a small hypodermic needle laced with poison and ready to use if needs be.My Pocketing $5 billion courtesy of the US Government was simply the cherry on top.
