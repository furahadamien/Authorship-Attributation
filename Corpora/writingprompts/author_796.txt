"Do you truly believe a world such as this has no place for a celebration of my splendor?"offered Lust, lounging in his seat next to Sloth, albeit in a rather different manner."Once again," Pride said with their head in their hands, "that's not how any of this works."Such lively discussion had been going for some time, and emotions had been running hot.Of course, given the nature of this particular setting, it would be more alarming to see things downplayed.What set today apart from the rest was not the fact of the debate, but the nature."Don't give us that cop-out shit!"Wrath shouted, "You may not have asked for it, but like it or not, you're the goddamn focus for an entire goddamn month, goddamn it!""Bring it down a bit, Wrath," Sloth interjected without even opening her eyes, "remember you still got gamers.""So do you, sweetie," said Envy, slithering his way uncomfortably into both the room and the conversation, "and I know it's not enough.""I'd rather not share, but it's cool," said Sloth."Me neither," said Greed, his eye twitching as usual, "but LUCKY ME, I get to split entire countries with you simpletons.""I took over pretty much every holiday without even trying," wheezed Gluttony, with either true passion or a slight heart attack, "that's pretty cool, right?""Shut up, Gluttony!"snipped Wrath and Greed."Ok, ok, look," said Pride, desperately trying to maintain their composure, "if I had an entire month dedicated to me, don't you think I'd be parading it in front of all of you ALL THE TIME?""I...I suppose," said Envy."Probably," said Sloth."The 'parading' line was funny," said Lust."Right," continued Pride, "so why would I be arguing against the idea?I want a month to myself SO BAD, but I want it on MY terms.Wrath, you know what I mean.""Fuck off, you're not my buddy," Wrath tossed back."Right," said Pride, taking a few breaths, "so let's just focus on what we do best, alright?"A murmur of hesitant agreement followed, then Greed piped up."But the election isn't for another year, right?"
