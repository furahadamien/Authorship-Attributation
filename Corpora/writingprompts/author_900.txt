I was never really into anything my dad talked about.From my youngest years I remember the podiums the, the flashing cameras.I remember being told throughout high school to be watchful what I do."Image is everything" he would say.Really it all bored me so I was never close with my dad.He would always say he was fighting to give the power back to the people.I thought it was a load but you try telling a man fifty years set in his ways all he believes is wrong; that's okay, I'll wait.Not really though I have a story to finish.I suppose all this is justifying why I never told him.It happened one of those days in high school.I was sitting there eating with dad when I felt odd, sick.I went to go get a drink of water, and it dawned on me the tv had been on.Silence grasped the house.I went into the living room; the tv was frozen on the latest news.I must of spent the next hour running down the block.Water from hoses frozen just before its droplets hit the flowers.The paper boy steady mid throw with the concentration on his face unwavering.Time was frozen.I thought of all that I could do with the non passing moments.Then it hit me a wave of great relief.Like when you take the first drink of water after a long day.I had forgotten my original problem of feeling sick.Time continued on.This would happen periodically throughout the years.Often multiple times a year.I'd feel the wave of sickness, and time would freeze.Did I have a superpower?Was this my body's way of dealing with illness?I discounted this theory after a few times of getting sick and there being no time freeze; that time I had to make a speech up on the spot was the worst time for it to not happen.When it did happen though, I'd try to put it to work.Catching up on schoolwork, doing a chore.Always careful not to do anything too obvious.This one time I had been talking to our neighbor Mr. Godfrey, and I didn't make it make in time.He never shut up about that time I disappeared on him after that.Dad became more invested in his work.Something troubled him a lot,
and I think it made him distance himself from me.He hid a lot in his office.We had a big fight.We both said some rather regretful things.He said things about my work ethic, and getting a job now that school was done.I told him I hated him, and that I wish I'd never see him again.I got that wave of nausea, by now I had pinpointed it to it spontaneity.Time froze.I decided it would be time to do some snooping.That's where we are now I guess.I went into his office and started digging through the draws.It wasn't long before I found a folder in the drawer.It was thick, almost like a dictionary of my fathers secrets.I snapped the rubber band off, and started to go through it.It was...newspapers and crime scene description.Each section had a sticky note: Marcy Williams - D, Roger Callon - R, Alexander Finley - R, Dean Stern - D. This list went on.As I was flipping through the list a single picture fell out of its place.It was of a wall, written in red was the phrase "Time is up"

For the first time, as I stood there in the silence of time.I heard something.The lock to our front door clicked.
