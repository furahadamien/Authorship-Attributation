My grandmother still worships the old gods.I dont know how she can keep track of all of them.There seems to be a god for every problem.I probably should have played more attention in history when we went over all this stuff.She always said I was a favorite of Aphrodite.She warned me that living with the favor of a God/Goddess would be difficult.I should have listened.Meeting girls has always been easy for me.People said I was just charming.I know better now.I met Sita when I was 15.There was something about her that just ignited a fire in me.As always I was able to catch her attention with just a short conversation.It wasn't long before the whole school knew we were dating.She was so beautiful.Long raven hair, bright green eyes that actually sparkled when she was happy.A smile that could brighten a room instantly and she always smelled so good.I knew from the moment we spoke that I was in love.Thinking back on it now, what did I know of love?I was a kid.A dumb idealistic brat in love with the Idea, of being in love.I remember that day after the homecoming dance.We were walking hand in hand.We stopped under the bleachers by the football field.She kissed me and I told her I loved her.She said she loved me too.I told her, "No matter what, I'll always be there for you.I swear on our love"
She broke up with me 3 weeks later.No explanation,  no apology.Just, "this isn't working.Find someone else"
I was as heartbroken as a kid could be.After a while I swore I'd never say those words to a girlfriend again unless I was sure she loved me too.I got rid of all her pictures and little gifts.I never wanted to see her again, but the God's take oaths seriously.I saw her again, for the first time 2 years later.I was driving home in the muscle car my parents got me for my birthday.It needed a lot of work but I was excited to have wheels.I saw her hunched over in the rain and cold by the bus stop.She had a large bag next to her.Too big to be for school.I pulled over.I got out and sat next to her, she barely looked up at me."Hey" was all she said."Hey" I replied."Need a ride?"I asked."That yours?"She asked."Yeah, birthday gift" I responded.She nodded."You have awesome parents."She whispered.She looked up at me."Im leaving town.I have an aunt that lives 3 hours away.If your serious about the ride, will you take me?"She asked.I thought about it for a moment.I'd just gotten the car and had never been out of town on my own before.Still the way she looked at me, her eyes pleading and full of sorrow.I couldn't say no."Sure, hop in.Ill get your bag."It didnt occur to me to ask why she was leaving or where her parents were.It just felt right to help.I got home at 4am.I was grounded for 2 months and my car was taken from me.She had smiled that beautiful smile when in had dropped her off.It was worth it.I met her again when I was a junior in college.I was invited to a frat party for the first time ever and almost didnt go.I felt I would miss out if I didnt though.College is about the experiences, so im told.At first I wasnt sure it was her, it had been so long, but when she smiled I knew.I wanted to talk to her and for a moment our eyes met.She was swooped up by a good looking guy in a football jersey before I could reach her.I spent the rest of the party bored.It was when I went searching for a bathroom that I found her again.I was told the bathroom was down the hall but I kept getting turned around.She came rushing out of a room I had passed twice.Her clothes were a mess and her lip was bleeding.She saw me and grabbed my arm.The guy I had seen her with came out of the room a few moments later.He stopped when he saw me."Hey" she said."I havent seen you in forever, walk me to my car?"She asked.I stood there glaring at the guy in the jersey."Sure, no problem" I finally reply.She didnt let go of me until we reached her car.Once again I earned a smile as she drove away.I walked back to my dorm thinking that one day, that smile would be the death of me.So on it went, I loved and lost and loved again.I would love my life and years would pass before seeing her again.Each moment we met was when she needed me most.Sometimes it was for small things, like a ride, other times it was more serious.I was there for her, just like I swore I would be.I stopped being surprised after a while.I lived my life with the assurance that I would see her again and earn another smile.I became successful in my career, had everything I'd ever wanted and more.Still, I would go out into the world each day, looking for her face amongst the crowd.Waiting for the moment when she would need me again.Now that final moment has arrived.That moment I knew would come.When that smile would be the death of me.This story,  is for you Sita.So you would understand why I did what I did.You see, I met your husband.He's a good man.I realize now why I hadn't seen you in so long, after meeting him.He showed me pictures of you and your kids.They're as beautiful as their mother.All with that same gorgeous smile.Dont worry, I didn't tell him I knew you.He came to ask me for something.Something apparently only I can give.My cancer is inoperable.I have been given only weeks to live.Caught it too late they said.The doctor told me because of my condition and my rare blood type,  I would be doing the hospital and several people in it, a great service and sacrifice,  if I would donate my organs.I hadn't made my decision until today.When your husband showed me your picture,  I knew.This is the last time I can be there for you.What I give to you hasn't been mine for a long time.Its been yours ever since I swore that oath, so many years ago.I give you my heart, to care for and keep safe.My oath is kept, I have no regrets.Who am I to question the Gods?
