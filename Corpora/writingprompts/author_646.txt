"WAAAAAAHOOOOOOO"

Another young person rocketed past me as I took the final steps towards the local "oldies" bar's front door.Third one today to nearly clip me.Bastards.As I pushed open the door the sounds of cable news reached my ears from inside."To recap our top story, everyone who has taken immortilate has gained the ability to fly."Sons of bitches.

I had spent several chapters already reading without seeing a choice.The book was long, but only like, lord of the rings long, I had gotten pretty far at this point.*Maybe the title is a lie.No.Angel's don't lie.Do they?Maybe they aren't angels.Maybe you're in hell.*

I stopped reading on the last thought.With considerable effort I pushed it away and kept reading the incredibly boring story of my infancy.Blah blah blah I ate mashed peas.Blah blah I hated them.Another spoonful is coming.And thats when I saw it.*You chose to close your mouth and turn away.To follow that path, go to Library Seraph, Wing Delta, Row 82, Shelf 7, Book 22, Page 83.*

*To knock the food out of your mother's hand, go to Library Saint, Wing Alpha-Omega, Row 2, Shelf 1, Book 30, Page 872*

*To accept the food, go to Library Heart, Wing Epsilon, Row 110, Shelf 3, Book 4, Page 220*

Yeah, I was going to be here a while.Edit: Formatting.
