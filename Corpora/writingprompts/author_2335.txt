100% of people who drink water die.That does sound like a clich a little bit doesnt it?Well, let me tell you something.It sounds a lot worse when you are 900 years old, you are thirsty and the only liquid in a 1000 miles radius is a plastic bottle of the transparent poison.It all started almost a thousand years ago, or so we are told by the history books.I was there to witness it but after so many years your brain tends to get memories mixed up a little bit.It might be the PTSD from the 300 years war, everyone fighting over the precious new resource that has just been invented.Or it might be the fact that I have spent the last 200 years in a desert.Im not sure and it doesnt really matter.What matters is that I have nothing to drink but water and 100% of people who drink water die.I dont want to be one of those fuckers.Not since we discovered that the same compound that makes up 60% of our bodies is the reason we age and eventually die.Remove water and there you have it  eternal life.Of course, then you have to solve the problem of people dying within 24-48 hours but thats why we have scientists, isnt it?Give them unlimited amount of cash and it turns out they can come up with anything.Even a non-lethal substitute for water.Except for the fact that it lefts you constantly thirsty.Fast forward a hundred more years and all the water-drinking sects are out of the picture, because, well 100% of people who drink water die.But then we got in a bit of a situation.With no other problems solved, we still had an ever-increasing population that still needs food to eat and places to sleep.We even introduced the delayed death penalty which was pretty much just locking a person up in a room with nothing but a glass of water.Once they drink it, set them free.After 90 years or something they would die.But you cant just force everyone to drink water can you?Even we didnt have that amount of money.Therefore, after a century of population problems, people did what people always do when in doubt  they went to war.It took us 500 years to stop it and a 100 more to start rebuilding.Thats when it all got complicated.There is a lot of science and history involved, but long story short  it turns out water was not always poisonous to us humans.See, tens of thousands of years ago, something, or someone managed to corrupt all water on this planet, turning every human mortal.However, according to an old manuscript they missed a place  a source of water, which stayed clean, water that people can drink without having to inevitably die at some point in the future.Some say its magic.Some say thats Gods work.Some say its the solution to all of our problems.Me?I just want a drink.
