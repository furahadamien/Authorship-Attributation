BriskUnassertiveness
It's uncanny how similar an internal interview is to final judgement.Down to the vague look of detachment and listlessness on - Carl flicked his gaze to one side of the table - yup, the person on the far left.Always the far left.The obvious things were off - instead of cheap suits, most of the god's - valkyries?It's been a while - had on a complex arrangement of armor and furs - but on the whole, Carl really couldn't tell the difference between this and his last promotion interview.Twiddling his spatula lightly in his left hand, Carl mused that this promotion might be a bit more permanent than that last one.One could tell how hard he was fighting to keep his face impassive by the subtle way his lip twitched.He couldn't help but find the humor in the fact that perhaps that company had done him a favor by firing him."I'm of the opinion that it is the wielder that makes the weapon" said the red head to Odin's right.She had enormous wings folded behind her back and a long twisted horn on the belt of her gown."Of course you are, Sigrun.You brought him here!"cried woman on the far left, suddenly filled with righteous indignation.She seemed to startle the rest of the council with her outburst, all of them turning to look at her."If you disagree, state your reasons" said Sigrun.Her gaze fell back on Carl, making him feel immeasurably small."If you cannot do so perhaps it would be best to hold your tongue.In the meantime, if you ask me, he is plenty worthy of the title 'warrior'"

There was a heavy silence as all of the gods and valkyries watched Carl.The uncomfortable dread that filled him whenever someone tried to size him up threatened to make him turn tail and flee the room.Why even bother with Valhalla anyway?Hel seemed perfectly fine...

 Yeah...But Carl didn't *want* fine.He wanted the Hall of the *Slain*.The hall of *warriors*.His childhood fascination with myths and legends filled him once again with the wonder and awe he thought he had forgotten.Carl fixed his jaw and met Odin's eyes head on.Odin's large brows furrowed as if he were deep in thought.He then slapped his hands on the table and sat back on his throne like he'd come to a decision."Charles DeAndre the Second!"he said, "What do you have to say on the matter?"Carl, caught perfectly off guard, stammered "Oh, uh...I was karate for six months so, I guess I could still do a jump kick?"Odin and Sigrun glanced at each other, so Carl panicked and yelled "and a ton of other cool stuff!""Uh, I got to level 60 in Call of Duty Black Ops zombies.I know that probably doesn't sound impressive... but it...is."Dead Silence.Odin never took his eyes off Carl, even as he asked "What is he doing here, Sigrun.It is not like you to have miscalculated so grievously."Sigrun actually pinched the bridge of her nose.Never had someone looked so exasperated with him since his mother found him on the roof with a homemade glider."I assure you, he is as much a warrior as anyone" said Sigrun "If you would just look at the circumstances of his death, it'd be perfectly clear why so.""Ah yes, please Carl, *do* expand on that" said the Valkyrie to the far left."Oh uh okay."Carl was suddenly aware that he was still wearing his work uniform."Well, I work at a restaurant - er, *worked* I guess.Anyway, we were being robbed - and usually, standard procedure is just go along with everything the robbers say and stay out of the way, but the robbers were just *off*, you feel me?As in, they were probably drug addicts or crazy.Probably both.Well, I was in the kitchen and I overheared two of the guys talking about how they were going to take one of the waitresses and... yeah.I couldn't live with myself if I let that happen, so I stopped them.""You stopped them?"asked Odin."Yes" 

"How did you do that?""Uh..." Carl was drawing a blank."That's a good question" he said.Carl tried to play through his memories of the robbery but it was as if the whole thing was blurred out.Now that he thought about it...

"How *did* I die?"Sigrun opened her mouth as if to answer, but the Valkyrie to Odin's right beat her to it."Interestingly, it seems you were done in *after* you'd won the battle."she said, "You were shot by one of you law enforcer's 'guns'"

*Oh*

"Oh" Carl was temporarily lost for words."If it's alright with everyone, I think it's time we came to a decision" said the last person in the room who hadn't spoken.She sat on the far right and kinda looked like Carl's best friend's Aunt Olga.There was a general hum of agreement."If you wouldn't mind stepping outside whilst we deliberate" said 'Aunt Olga'.There was a loud thunking sound behind Carl.He turned saw a large set of double door's that weren't there before standing open."Uh, sure.No prob"

Carl stepped into a large and beautiful hallway.While he admired the intricate crown molding, the council was deciding his fate.Another similarity of the internal interview and judgement day, though Carl wryly.Sooner than he hoped and somehow later than he would have liked, the council came to a decision and called him back in."We have chosen to administer a test" said Sigrun before Carl could even sit."You will do battle here in front of us, and if we deem you worthy you will be accepted into Valhalla"

Carl felt the blood leave his face."Do you accept these terms?"she asked.He didn't know where it came from; perhaps the fear of leaving this room a coward, maybe a gut feeling that he'd *earned* warrior status and like hell was he going to give that up.Probably, Carl was just an idiot.Still, it's not like he could get any *deader*.Before he could stop himself, Carl said "Yes"

"Good" said Odin, before he leaped clear over the table and faced Carl.He drew his sword from it's scabbard and pointed it at him."Ready yourself" 

Carl swallowed and lifted his spatula.With a roar like a raging bull Odin rushed at Carl.Carl, riding the high of ghost adrenaline or something ran at Odin as well.Just when his spatula met Odin's sword, a blinding light surrounded him and Carl found himself transported entirely from the room of judgement.All around him were people in armor and carrying weapons.They were chatting with each other and drinking from large gold and silver goblets.Music filled the room."Hey!New guy!"someone yelled.Carl was still processing what just happened, but turned in the direction the voice came from.A guy in fatigues with a rifle over his shoulder slung an arm around Carl."Seriously man, I cannot wait to hear your story" he said looking pointedly at Carl's uniform and spatula, "but first things first.Welcome to Valhalla!"
