I stood there, looking at them.Two women, a friend betrayed and a lover coveted.They both grew up in harsh conditions, worse than I could endure.I took advantage of the firsts weakness and unloaded all my dissatisfaction and malice into her, constantly tearing her down while holding onto her as a friend to ensure I wasn't alone.I saw her cries for help and took them as openings to empower myself instead.I rendered our friendship superficial to the extent that I abandoned her on a whim, to prove a point about my apathy.She began a downward spiral through her drug abuse, partying, stripping, and prostitution until she overdosed one final time.She died before her life could start, before she could finish school, before she could find happiness - because of me.The second I saw her weakness as an invitation to help.I took all of my apathetic tendencies and narcissism and pushed past them for her.While she needed to grow and process her abuse, I held onto her because I saw her happiness as an extension of my own; the source of it infact.But through her suffering, I suffered.I grew and began to understand the toxic nature of my dependency.Out of the ruins of the first iteration of our relationship something real blossomed, a mutual understanding and love for one another.I helped her process her past and put the blade down.I supported her and by elevating her, I matured myself.She found a career, made memories, and overcame the odds to find happiness - because of me.I think both of them suspected, or perhaps knew, how I felt because in unison they spoke.*"You aren't the world, let alone our world.While you're responsible for aspects of our lives, things set in motion  by our childhoods, our friends, our jobs, and ourselves don't involve you."*

The first step forward.*"While you hurt me, badly, you alone weren't what set me on the path I chose.You were young and naive, unaware of the power words hold.The kindness you've shown others in life will never redeem you of your actions towards me, but those actions won't alone tarnish your soul."*

She stepped back, as the second moved forward.*"Our relationship was one of the most important aspects of my life.You gave me somewhere to hide from the loneliness and dark memories when I couldn't chase them away.But you give yourself too much credit, I'm strong enough on my own.Your help will always be appreciated, though I would have survived without.You've committed no true evils in your life, but you've committed nothing on the other end of the scale either."*


She stepped back, leaving me to stand in silence.They began to fade, along with the walls.My vision began to blur and my head spin.*"Wait, no!Come back!You can't leave me!"*

Nothing.Perhaps this is just.I donated to protect the forest and ocean, but not my fellow man.I gave spare change, while squandering hundreds on leisure.I urged equality without action.I practiced nihilism while preaching collectivism.*"You are worthy of a second chance at obtaining eternity.Your missteps are not beyond salvation and kindness comes in many forms, regardless of motivation."*

Suddenly I'm 15 again.
