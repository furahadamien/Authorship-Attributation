It was only supposed to be a temporary gig, until I was done with school, to help make ends meet.I figured since I had the 'gift' I should make some use of it, and since I was young, and somewhat  lacking in imagination/experience, Doorman seemed a pretty easy gig.After ten years of Doormanning, my temporary gig was becoming a lifelong dead-end chore, until the night She arrived.Gun to my head, I would have sworn She couldn't have been more that sixteen years old, but the numbers never lied.There they were, floating above Her head, just as clear as everyone else's, four digits.And not low four digits either, in fact, She must be in the fives by now.Like I did with everyone who approached me, I asked, "ID please."and She looked at me, She didn't smile, or blink, or anything, she just, *looked* at me.She knew, and She knew that I knew, and that was the last thing I remembered for a very long time.I couldn't tell you what She looked liked, except She was perfect.Not pretty, or beautiful, or sexy, or any of those other words people used then.She was just ...Perfect.Had She told me She was Athena, or Aphrodite, or Eve, or Lilith, I would have believed Her.I now believe that this is the truth of it.As it turns out, a ten year stint as Doorman was way more temporary than I could have guessed then.This was over seven hundred years ago.Before the Strangers came, before the Off-World Colonies had even been proposed, and before we all had to learn The One Language.(I still hate the sound of Esperanto) 

I know She is still out there, and I know that She knows I am still here.Although there is every probability that we will never meet again, there is still hope.Some days I want to thank Her, some days I would like to try to end Her, (if that is even possible) but every day I want to see Her.Every day.
