The pills hadn't worked after all.I was still in bed, and when I tried going downstairs, my parents were busy talking with guests.They all ignored me, as usual.Erupting with anger, I tried to think up what I was going to say to my parents once the guests I didn't know had gone, when a little girl, probably the daughter of a guest, came up to me and asked to play.I was relieved that the drugs hadn't made me giddy or sick, but I was still a little pissed off.I was pleased to finally have someone to talk to - it felt like some sort of reward after all I had suffered - but someone my age and her don't really have much in common, and being in a bad mood didn't make me feel much like playing.I tried to contain my irritation for this well-meaning young person and considered trying to tell her a story or teach her something, but immediately realized that it would be beyond her comprehension level, and that I would either come off as boring and intimidating by talking about dull adult stuff, or patronising by trying to speak at her level.She led me along and started trying to attract the attention of the guests and my parents.I was initially very pleased that she was vouching for me, as she tried to introduce me to her parents, but being a toddler, she was ignored, too.Then she tried to introduce me to my own parents.It was more than a little surreal, but I suppose that's the kind of non-logic a five year old would come up with.Actually, she was six - her parents stated it proudly - but I wasn't aware of that.Seems like a minor distinction, but perhaps she wouldn't have bothered talking to me if she was five and would have ran away crying instead.Then, things started getting really bizarre.First, I noticed that my parents were talking about me while I was still in the room.This would have been plausible enough, but they weren't making commentary - they didn't seem to realize I was there at all, even though I yelled and was right in front of them.That's when I stood right in front of all of them, and her parents, along with my entire family, said flat out that there was nobody there.It wasn't a prank; their tone was too convincing.Next, I realized that what I'd been through hadn't been real at all.I looked down to my feet only to realize there were no feet - nothing at all, in fact.I began to wonder what sort of person would be sick enough to put a VR machine on me before I woke up, only to find that my entire body felt numb and there was nothing on my head.Those drugs must have been strong after all, then.I wondered when this weird - was it a hallucination?a dream?both?would be over.Well, it still isn't over.
