"Loved"... *I snorted.*

"Accepted"... *I laughed.A long laugh.I couldn't help it.*

*With such a sharp contrast to every other comment and action directed toward me in daily life, this was obviously either a joke or directed at someone else.I am one of those who society would simply prefer not to exist.I have untreated chronic pain so it's more convenient to pretend I don't exist than to help me.Apparently, especially among doctors.Even among others, I can't be real.I must be faking, an addict, a criminal, a liar.Then people aren't really suffering from increasingly strict opiate regulations.People aren't being tortured and vilified just because they dared to be in pain.Not really.Not in the US.I am not real to them because it makes it easier for them to live not to think of other people existing in that way.And maybe soon they will be one person closer to having what they want.*

*As my laughter faded, I noticed my lips had assumed the shape of a slight but genuine smile.*

At least this was a nice try, *I thought.*
