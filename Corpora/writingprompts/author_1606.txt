After you grow old and die, you wake up 25 million years ago as a Hominid Primate, asleep on a tree.Your whole life was a vivid hallucination you had after ingesting a funny looking mushroom.After this experience, you have great knowledge, and you're the smartest living being on the planet.Or so what you had in mind, until your mom yelled:

"Z'hgakh, how long do you intend to be stoned in that tree?Get your lazy ass and help packing.""But-but mom, I had this weird vivid dream, in it I was a space enginee-"

"Z'hgakh!Rather than flapping your mouth, you better spent that energy carrying the boxes to the flyer.If we late for the off-planet passage, you can be damn sure you'll get your ask spanked!"Seeing that you can't out-yelled your mother, you get down from the tree, while your younger siblings snickered into your direction.All you wanted in life was to be a successful movie scriptwriter, alas, lack of imagination kept sending your scripts into rejection bin.That's why you used the Amantina Mushrooms your stoner friend recommended to you for a trip of unworldly inspiration.Sadly, most of the trip are mediocre.And now, you must follow your family off the planet, since the Administration had declared that a severe Ice Age is imminent and the colony will be abandoned for good."Mom, what about Sthurcho?"You asked your mom about the fate of the small tailless quadruped mammal your family keep as a pet."We can't take him, so before we go, just put some food outside and release him to the wild."You looked at the poor guy."Sorry, boy, we can't take you.But I had dreamed about what your descendant can achieve.Hopefully, you can catch us later."You patted his head and opened the door.You prompted him to go, he hesitated for a moment and looked back at you, then went into the deep jungle.Meanwhile, what awaiting you is a boring job as a fruit picker on some star-forsaken rimworld...
