We should have finished the war when we had the chance.America was always a nation of war.It was born in a war for independence, forged in a war to remain whole, tempered in to a super power by the a war against one of the greatest evils this world had ever know.The Americans navigated battlefields and ruined cityscapes like a fish through a reef.For years their armies  sat at stations around the world waiting for next big war, a chance to be tested once more, waiting for the day the world needed their might once more, and then that day came.America had always been a nation of division.Its population scattered and broken into fractions by the powers that be allowing petty despots and tyrants to shape their political landscape.But the day came when the people grew tired of they're governments corruption and callousness, tired of the manufactured division, and they solved the only way they understood, war.America had always been a nation of technology.It was they who built the first plane, split the first atom, sent the first rocket to the moon, and in the aftermath of their second civil war they, to ensure it their population would be forever unified, they blurred the line between man and machine, erasing their divisive humanity and integrated themselves with the circuit, becoming one mine, one voice, one people.When the calamity struck and the tyrants sought to claim the world for their own, these new Americans struck back with percision and force never before possible.Entire nation's were atomized in minutes, whole populations were purged by transhuman super soldiers that would not die not matter what they were subjected to.By the time the war was over many placed had been bombed into permanent inhabitability.As the nation's that remained sought a means to recover a decision was reached, isolation.Each nation would take fifty years to rebuild itself before rejoining the world stage.America though it survived the war better than others, agreed.It's troops withdrew behind the massive walls it had erected around it's borders, and it's massive distributed consciousness dedicated itself to one goal, preventing the next war and ensuring human survival.But the isolation was just a ruse, had the Americans decided to claim Dominion over the world after the war there would have been none who could stop them, the world needed time to heal before it was ready to accept these new beings.America has returned.Exactly one year ago today the walls fell and the world learned what a gestalt mind can do with fifty years.Looking back I think they knew we were lying to them, but they agreed anyway and used the time to prepare.Any semblance of their humanity is now gone, there bodies replaced completely by machines, their minds removed from the bodies and stored in massive dataspires holding millions of consciousnesses.In the fifty year intermission between wars the Americans came to the realization that as long as humanity existed in its current form the chance it would exterminate itself was to high to ignore.So it sent envoys to every remaining nation with an ultimatum, integrate with their consciousness, or be declared obsolete.Some agreed to be assimilated, others resisted, but were "convinced".The rest of us attempted to fight back but we were like ants before the magnifying glass, even with the hardware left over from the war nothing we can throw at them slows them down for long.Soon they will be here and their broadcasts will play, calling all those still willing to join them to their processing centers.I will fight them when they come and I will likely be killed for my efforts.We are but a few thousand remaining before their untold might and when we refuse their final offer they will not hesitate to exterminate us.I fear that I may see the day when I am the last "man" left on Earth.If father were still hear he would probably laugh, a nation once obsessed with freedom and independence has both erased the concept of individuality and will likely kill the last free men on earth.So be it, I don't know if there is a hear after but if your watching me father, I will see you soon.
