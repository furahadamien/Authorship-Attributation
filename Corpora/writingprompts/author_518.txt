All my friends, their dads had theirs.Kelly's was in the millions, 

Jake's was in the Billions.Marcus's was a hundred thousand

As he left flowers on his dads grave.Where then is my dad's cup?I know he had one... 

its around here somewhere

I'd love to know where he placed

Cuz' my old man is pretty great.Ah there it is, I finally found it

Behold, it just says "pops".No numbers I guess.Because he always did his damndest

He never tried to be number one.Because just being "pops" was always enough.
