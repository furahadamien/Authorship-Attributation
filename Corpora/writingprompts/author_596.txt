Inluminous
Another day in hell.Another day like each in the past 34 years.Getting up, heading to work, waiting for my boss to leave to play some Grand Theft Auto, going home and spending my last free hours in Just Cause."Still playing those childish games at your age?"isn't rare.Well, I don't really care.There's just this certain... thing about destruction that I can't find the right words for.Something I just can't explain using just words.A feeling deep embeded in my soul.Something I would never get rid of even when seeing death with my very own eyes.Sadly I can't make it reality.Humankind rejects destruction for what they call progression.I can't stand it.Where's the point in living that life?"So?what are YOU gonna change?Exactly.Nothing" he said.It's the only thing I remember from that day.He told me I happened to be in a car accident.Hit my head; got a scar across my left eye; all that stuff.To summarize: I lost my memory.I don't remember my childhood, my parents, not even my name.In that case I thought why not name yourself James Light.Yeah that James Light.The one, who singlehandedly brought chaos and destruction to the states.The person I adored each and every day.Born a genious, rising from absolutely nothing to the person everyone feared the most.He's what you could call perfection.To bad everyone rejected my name.Now they call me Steve May.I hate it.Well, I should get going.My shift is over and no way in hell am I spending more time here than I absolutely need to.At least the roads are almost empty.While I would complain that I feel watched, it's been like that every day so I guess it's just me being paranoid.I fall to the ground

"S-s-sorry, I wasn't looking where I was going", she stumbled.I looked at the paper she dropped.**18 Nov. 2009 - James Light reveals face!**

Why'd anyone use a paper these days?You've got the Internet, don't you?"I guess nothing happen-", I try to say before recoiling.They come running from every possible place.Try to hide it but it's too late.I always wondered why something broke down the moment I looked at his face.They've been watching.Now I remember."Should we start the last Phase, James?", she asked smiling."We're 19 seconds ahead.Too bad that I expected this", I said with a grin.
