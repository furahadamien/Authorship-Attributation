Feathers!Why are there always so many feathers?It's hard to walk in the dark.You have to use night vision.Don't look at the lights, and close one eye when you open the refrigerator.Close the left, or the right, but keep one acclimated to the dark.Pee sitting down so you won't need the lights.They are so little.They used to be.Now, to pick one up, I'd have to use the fireman's carry.Taller than me!Or at least as tall.But I'm not going to wake them up.Let them sleep.Open the cupboard to get a cup so I can have some coffee.#1 Dad.A badge with a gold #1.Now it says #2 with a picture of poo.You're shit.'#3 Combination.Is that diarrhea?Maybe just doing both....

'#4 ...I'm losing ground.'#5 I smelled gin on the soccer coach's breath.But I also noticed the budding breasts under the little goalie's jersey.'#6 I brought the gun with me.I can protect my house.'#7 Outside, in the shed.Away from the house.'#8 Better off without me.'#9 Temple?Throat?In the mouth?All the numbers are gone now.You are no longer a father.Use the pillow to mute the sound.The old pillow grandma used to prop your head.The feather pillow.

Eyelashes are the venetian blinds to the soul. 

My nana was philosophical, even when kneading bread dough.Thinking myself clever I asked, What are the eyebrows?

Past the rim of her glasses, her right eye found me and then went quickly back to work.Bushy.

Instinctively, my hand went to my infamously fatherly eyebrows.Nana's shade was as well known as her baby back ribs.But she wasn't a monster.She covered the dough with a tablecloth, brushed her hands on her apron, looked me straight in the eyes, snorted with pursed lips and said, Here's your moldy mix of morning melodies!

Using the oldies channel as an alarm was a good idea.Placing my phone on the dresser out of reach was a good idea.Setting my alarm for 5 AM was a good idea, I had a lot to do to prepare for the wake.I was out of good ideas, I had to get started.I rolled out of bed, put on my fluffy pink nana robe and took a piss.Finding a demon in you kitchen is never good.Seeing the buttocks of a hairy man-thing trying to sweep up flour in your kitchen is more-never-worse.As of this writing, my main request to the demon council is to not only allow demons to wear FUCKING SOMETHING!, but to mandate it.With oddly puppy-dog eyes it spun at me, possibly surprised.I thought I sensed a little choke, like the tight throated cry of a sorrowful child.How did you summon me? it pleaded.With this, I said, and shifted Nana's cookbook from the counter to the tabletop.You were supposed to be chicken soup, but, I don't know, maybe I got the recipe mixed up.

The beast turned the book toward him and began scanning the page with his hobnailed finger.After skimming about a third of the page, the vacuous eyes turned to me, bleak, forlorn, and Wasserman-Schultz dead.Where it says to separate the eggs, it doesn't mean to keep brown eggs in the other room!
