It whispers to me, softly and sweetly, reminding me of the promise it makes.Amazingly I discovered it at a garage sale after my neighbor died.He was some kook who refused to leave his house since basically the 1940s, whittling away his father's fortune in a refusal to interact with the rest of the world.When he finally kicked the bucket, his grand nephew sold nearly everything in the house, including the collection of swords and knives left over from World War two.A little pile of Japanese steel that glinted and sparkled, despite the day being entirely overcast.It called to me that day as it does now.Whispering.Yearning.Promising.Promising of a world torn apart by fire, divine and nuclear, all encompassing and devastating our planet.When you hold the knife the world becomes very, very small, and a vision jerks you into the atmosphere, so far away you can see almost every inch of the earth bathed in flame.*This is what awaits those who don't taste me,* it whispers.Then the world becomes an Eden, a paradise of green and blue and health.Vibrant and beautiful, an entire world of hope and glory.*When a soul enters me,* it would speak softly, drowning out every thought and part of you, *I send them here.*

How much did I pay for that knife?Ten, fifteen bucks?Didn't matter.Salvation is priceless, I would say.Whatever they say about me now, I consider myself a shepherd of lost souls and a doomed planet.It took them faster than I expected to plaster my face over their screens and windows, but nonetheless I refuse to turn myself in.To doom more to the fire that is to come.I park my car not too far from my intended target.Already I can hear them, the light, cheery voices of youth echoing over the pavement.*Save the innocent,* the blade tells me.*Spare them of the world to come.*

A woman sees me in the parking lot and says nothing, simply points and then sprints away.It matters little, I will come for her when the time is right.More shouts.A bustle of activity, of locked doors and hurried calls.Little time.There's little time to accomplish what I must do.I make my way through halls and corridors, looking for the rooms containing the youngest of the children.Why are they so afraid?Don't they see?Don't they see that their world is doomed and I have come to give them the release to a better one?To save them from all this suffering and pain, and the oncoming holocaust of fire?Flames lap at my heels, but I cannot see them.I attempt to break down a door, but it holds fast.Heavy in its weight and unyielding in strength.Someone yells at me to stop.A portly man in blue holds a weapon pointed at me, but no, no not those they won't save the children, they only send a soul to the twisting emptiness between worlds to howl into the dark.I'll save the man, then.I'll save them all.I raise the knife and it yells, deafening in its command, that blood must spill and fill the blade, and I scream and charge.Weights slam into me, though I hear nothing, the great buzzing and voice still speaking to me, overlapping in order and command.Blood, hot and beautiful, clogs my throat.I'm drowning, drowning in my own blood.*Not here,* I think to myself, though it's distant and weak.The buzzing of the knife's command overpowers any though, even those in service to the blade.*I cannot drown here, cannot die here, there are so many left, so many left to the fire, I cannot stop now.*

Shouts.More shouts around me, and the man stands over me, his face pale and white, sweat dripping down from his forehead.A man who cannot believe what he has just done.Darkness spreads from the corners of my eyes, obscuring my vision.Cold.Frozen to the ground, unable to move or speak or scream, I wait for the void.It finds me, though it takes its time.*It's him,* the man thinks to himself, inspecting the corpse he has just made.*With that weird, long knife.*

Elementary school security officer one, psychotic serial killer zero.*What the hell is that, what do you even call it?* the man thinks, looking at the blade lying limp in the dead man's hand.Curved.Vicious.Sharp.He inspects the blade, watching the man's blood pool beneath it.*Pick me up,* a voice tells him.It's soft and sweet.*Pick me up,* the knife tells him.Speaks to him.Coos and woos him, seductively calling him from the deep dark blood of its previous wielder.*We must continue our work.*

They kill each other as they always have.En masse.And per usual, no matter how they pretty up the motivations with lofty goals and eloquent speeches, they kill each other for the same reasons.Hell; they've been doing it for as long as I've been alive.Before then, even.You could say human history is written by a bloody pen, to the surprise of no one.Sure, I saw it then, I see it now.What weighs heavy is the knowledge of its uselessness and repetitiveness.Humans have this classical conditioning to kill each other in wholesale extravagance, and the more their methods change, the more horrifying the results.So I stay on the fringes, helping the lost and forgotten.Those without access to care, those without access to food or shelter.I do what I can now, to make up for what I did so long ago.*Newfound immortality can sometimes make you lose sight of consequences.*

I push the thought aside, returning to the work.The work.The endless, grinding, horrifying work."Raise the leg," I command.The nurse does so, hopefully this'll help stop the bleeding.The hole, nice and small and round, pulses out blood at regular intervals, making that weird watery texture that clings to the leg hairs.The man who'd been unlucky enough to get caught in sniper alley moans softer now, though that may be the morphine kicking in.Sometimes you get those random flashes from the past, looking at those infected wounds.This'll turn and fester into something dangerous if I don't address it here and now."We need maggots," I say, remembering examining those infected wounds beneath boiled leather and chainmail, but catch myself.That's the problem with being this old.Memories enjoy whisking me to places where the dead still speak.The woman volunteering as a nurse doesn't respond, only blinks at me.Always tired.Always afraid.When they're tired, you can usually say whatever you want to them.But you can't talk in a medical scenario like this.You need to command.Force the bystanders to participate.This isn't a place for professionals, but this is neither the time or place where they can flourish.I can take a bullet or two and be fine.The rest?Not so much.But still, I try to maintain a sense of authority whenever I can.It helps, at least.Do this NOW.Get me this amount of such and such and I needed it five minutes ago.I may have all the time in the world, but they don't."Mr.Richardson?"A small voice, heavily accented timidly wafts over the moans and groans of dying men and women.No.Not timid.Broken.Someone is pulling me away, though I'm still focused on this wound.It needs cleaning, it needs stifling, it needs proper attention, real help, real professional care that can't be cobbled together by volunteers in camps too close to the ever present fighting.Heal.As best as you can.Do you remember the ridiculous methods?The crushed emeralds and the balancing of humors and all that ridiculous nonsense that probably killed more than it could possibly save?Keep them alive, keep the blood inside.*It's delicious though.The blood, the blood, the blood.Sweet and hot.Take a taste, be subtle.Wipe your hands across your mouth and let it trickle down your tongue.*

No.I don't need blood anymore.I quit it.I don't need it.I'm not that kind of thing anymore.Doctors, especially in places of greatest need always carry that same resigned posture, that broken and barely-lucid look on their face.Never enough sleep.Never enough bandages, never enough help, never enough time.Always fighting the clock."I'll take over," she says.She shouldn't have to.But what can you do; homemade drones managed to drop a few live grenades on some volunteer medics a week before, and we can barely manage the staff as it is.The boom of artillery can be heard, with a few patients jump with the sound.In the next instant, they relax.It's outgoing, not incoming.Not that the shells care.Sinner or saint, they blow us all to smithereens."Fine," I manage, wiping my hands clean.*Save the towel.Lick it later.*

No.Moving between the makeshift tents, I walk through streets cluttered with rubble and debris.The clatter of small arms fire sounds even further away, it's echoes strengthened by the distant walls of the valley.I'm being led to a tent, and how many tents have I entered?War tents all over the world.In almost every war and conflict, saving who I can, preventing infections before the humans truly understood what was going on.Not bad for a peasant boy from Bohemia.In a tent, a woman with raven-black hair sits at a desk, flanked on either side by burly men with expensive looking rifles.Fancy and new.Not too much dust, clean and full magazines.No grime in the barrel, no broken equipment.When these men pull the trigger, it fires.And certainly not locals.Private military personnel, I'd say.Though not government kind.THEIR kind.The Hunter's kind.Taking a seat, we exchange pleasantries.I'm vaguely aware of them, but do not truly know their intentions.They've been observing, rather than participating in the civil conflict.The woman doesn't appear to waste any time.She speaks with the kind of certainty that comes from always commanding the respect in a room.A no bullshit kind of lady.My kind of lady."Mr. Richardson, we've taken great pains to find you.We are aware of your...condition, and choose to offer you sanctuary in exchange for your rather unique skillset."It's matter of fact and straight to the point.No preamble, no dramatic rant about the history of vampires and humans, of the secretive idiotic conflict between pretentious men and women desperate to kill as many 'nightcrawlers' as they can.They always talk to you like this when they want something from you.Same as Lincoln.Same as Louis.Same as Gustaff.They always ask for your very special expertise, and it's never about humans.Always about my own kind.The monsters that stalk the shadows and drain the blood of virgins, if you believe the church.Which I don't.But still.Those day have long past."I'm not easy to find," I say, the dust clotting my throat.*You've spent so long hiding, haven't you?Fighting the urges?A consequence of being a good Samaritan?*

*You saved a soldier, though you thought he came from the Lord's castle.So long ago, giving him water, shelter and care.Hiding him from your parents in the barn, a long forgotten relic of ancient time.Did he know then he was going to come back and bite you while you slept?*

*Turn you into an abomination like him?He even thought he was doing you a favor.In exchange for saving his life, he 'saves' yours.How long had that man been running from the church's Hunters?How long had he spent, bleeding black blood into blindingly white snow?Fangs drawn, veins coursing.He knelt over you at night, too terrified to scream, whispering dark words and spells in a language you could only pray to not understand.*

"I think you know what I'm going to ask you, Mr. Richardson.It'll require taking you somewhere far from here."she says.Pull me out of a war zone?There's only one reason for such a pleasant set of terms, rather than the usual *Die foul demon spawn!*

"In exchange, we offer a sense of immunity.""From your kind?""From our kind."She speaks without really considering what I may have to say on the subject.Human through and through, arrogant to the last.By her posture, a Hunter.A killer of my own kind.Though they'll never beat the classic killers, the ones who ride moonbeams and sail through the night, slipping into rooms and draining men and women dry.That must be some kind of saying in her business, though.Humans can do their best, true.But no one can kill a vampire like another vampire, and usually over a pint of blood."Work for us."Silence.Only the sound of distant warfare.No more running?A peaceful existence?Sounds too good to be true.She's been speaking, but I haven't been listening.The words roll lazily, bouncing through a dry desert air.Somewhere, yelling.Violence.The killing, it grates.The killing, it takes its toll.No matter how long you help, they find a new excuse.The same reasons.The same excuses.Dedicate hundreds of years to it, but it's never enough.Never enough lives saved.Maybe I'm tired.Maybe I've been doing this for far too long.I'm just so tired.Tired of the death.Tired of the sheer horror that masks me from those who would see me dead.Tired of being alone.Maybe if I just bite my pride and do the job, they'll leave me alone.No more running.No more hiding.Some kind of sense of normalcy?A golden key to a life I've never had?I cut her off before she can work on her false attempts at convincing.She clearly doesn't care about what she's saying.How rare must this be?The humans who dedicate their lives to ending our kind's stain on this Earth with false platitudes and a bargain?"I'll do it," I hear myself saying.It's not me, someone else.Someone who doesn't care about the details or what they entail.Someone who doesn't care about the cost or the measure, only the reward.Peace and freedom.She smiles at me, motioning for me to follow the men beside her.Double cross me, and they'll regret it.Still, the itch.*Just one last drink.*

*Just one more drop of blood.*

No.*You say no, but I follow.Addiction loves you, even if you hate me.*

I'm not one of them.Not one of the monsters that hunt and kill with no sense of remorse, humanity's light long burned out.Last of my bloodline.Last of my family.Does it matter?Healing to atone for my sins?I don't hurt people.Not anymore.r/storiesfromapotato

"Three colors?What exactly do you mean by that?""Ah, I apologize."The being across from me taps its headset a few times, twisting a few dials."I believe my translator made an error," it says.Oh well.It happens."I believe I've fixed it.Now, is it true your species can only exist in three dimensions?""Unfortunately, yes.""Ah, that explains the lack of faster than light travel.""I suppose it does," I say, twirling a pen in my right hand."So the primary reason for this exchange is technological, I take it?"It asks its questions in that weird imitated monotone of computerized speech.Must be a fancy AI, too.It's got simulated inflections and regional dialects and everything.Pretty deep in the uncanny valley, I'd say."Well we've received many signals from your planet, and offer a simple exchange.With our upgrades, you should be able to craft spacecraft that are capable of faster than light travel."Excellent.That's exactly what we wanted to hear."And our corporation will maintain exclusive rights to this technology for the next decade," I say.It shakes its tendrils around its head in mock acceptance.Closest thing to a nod, I assume."In exchange, we'll give you exclusive rights to our combat drone schematics, specifically the orbital defense designs."It salivates slightly, and something wet and heavy drips onto the floor.Disgusting."This seems to be a fair exchange, is it not, human?""I believe so."With this tech we'll be able to beat out those generational colony ships sent out hundreds of years ago, back when we were first starting to crack open asteroids in the belt between Mars and Jupiter."I do have another question, human.""Ask away," I say.Though I have some idea of what it may be."The Ghoosha sent messages to us as well, asking for aid in exchange for our technology.""The Ghoosha?""The other race.""Ah."Bit of a sad story, but still, it's just curiosity.Humans have an amazing ability to forget about the atrocities they'll commit to stay alive."Well that was mostly accidental," I say.Accidental in the way a man takes out a life insurance policy on his soon to be dead partner."They lived beneath the oceans, and couldn't survive on land.Gills and all, to be precise.""Indeed," the alien representative says, though I can't tell if the emotion is genuine or falsified."We killed them before we'd discovered gravitons.""How so?""Too much plastic in the ocean.Shredded their lungs to bits.""And they asked us to save them?""We believe so.No one discovered their messages until after they'd died.""I imagine it was quite a shock to find underwater civilizations in the deep abyss.""That it was."The alien seems to ponder this, and stands to leave."We appreciate doing business with you," it says."Likewise."As it leaves, we already have begun to receive the schematics.Easily decipherable, though that goes without saying.*BZZZZZZZZZZ*

A notification from my cybernetic implant."Mr.Rogers?""Yes?""Shall we upload the schematics now?""Yes.""How long will it take for them to notice they're corrupted?""Oh, they won't figure it out until it's too late."I take out a cigarette, lighting it and taking a deep drag.Ghoosha.What a stupid name.A stupid species that died a stupid death because it wasn't willing to step up and do what needed to be done.I wonder what they called themselves.Plenty of anthropologists dig through those strange artificial cities carved into the ocean floor, though the language still can't be deciphered.Maybe if we sell planet cracking rights to Mercury they'll give us a few more uplifting designs.Ghoosha.Call them what you want.I'll just think of them as those idiot squids trapped in oceans so polluted it'd be like trying to breathe through a constant stream of gasoline poured down your throat.The aliens will build our designs, and be quite surprised when we activate the backdoor and turn their systems against them.Hell, they never expected their android servants to begin resisting and destroying their own creators.Whatever they think of us, they don't seem to blame humanity for those schematics.Whatever.What's the saying?Fool me once, shame on you.Fool me twice?Well that just makes you a sucker.Infect them with a disease and they come to us for the cure.Not our fault they gave up warfare a long time ago.After all, there's not that much room in the solar system anymore.And there's always profit to be found in the most unlikely of places.Perhaps on their home world.Perhaps on their stations.Perhaps from their own star.Another drag.With these ships, it won't take us long to get there.Scan their system, infiltrate communication arrays, map their colonial strongholds and systematically take what's theirs.We got shareholders to please and they're impatient sons of bitches.It's nothing personal.Just business.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a way, the galaxy was becoming smarter.Sentience isn't that hard to come across, though mostly found in those primal beings that claw and kill and eat with no regard to the suffering it causes.That is the law of nature.Consume or die.Adapt or die.Basically either be the best, or die.Death tends to be nature's preferred method of selection.On the third rock around a rather average yellow star, orbited a planet populated by naked apes.They killed, they loved, they laughed, they plotted, the helped, they prayed, they raged, they envied, they shared and they lived.When they decided intelligence and stamina could let them dominate they planet, their species grew and consumed and destroyed and slaughtered and flourished.Such was the will of the nude monkey.Two legs, two arms, one big hunk of meat between their ears that told them interesting things and lent impressive deductive skills.Most of the time it could be trusted.Some of the time it couldn't.Initial observations of the planet yielded quick answers.Hundreds of sentient species, with a few that you could argue were sapient.An important distinction, but here was a planet capable of sapping most of the galactic population limit.Some of these animals were no threat to the overall limit; there could only be so many dogs and cats and elephants and monkeys.Humans, were quite the different story.If they weren't able to kill themselves, they'd spread throughout their arm of the Milky Way in a few hundred years.Sure, they'd probably cap off at twelve billion on Earth alone.But what about on their space stations?On their colonies?On other terra-formed worlds?The council's decision was quite unanimous, though one or two protested out of caution.Why not let them die out on their own planet?Why not let them destroy their own world, removing billions from the collective galactic consciousness?Overruled by more impetuous minds, a few ships were sent to glass the planet, sterilizing the Sol system and preventing humanity from growing past their little blue world.Except something went wrong in orbit.Something didn't go according to plan.No one would be able to pinpoint the exact moment they knew things had gone wrong, but in the decades of failed launches and space expeditions, the low orbit of Earth was a minefield of debris that the humans were in the process of cleaning up.Nearly a dozen ships shocked into low orbit, only to be rendered full of holes and partially damaged.Most fell to earth.Some were captured by orbital satellites.Instead of destroying the Earth, the council had lent it the collected knowledge of the advanced species of the Milky Way.What would take a hundred years to discover, humans adapted in one.Scientific advancements so advanced that most of them considered basically magic were reverse-engineered faster than anyone could imagine.Humans seemed to enjoy pattern recognition, and to enhance galactic cohesion most systems were designed to be easily replicated and understood across species.Perhaps this shows the arrogance that comes with age, that an ancient civilization should always crush the younger.That after conquering a hundred species, there comes a sense of apathy towards the destruction of belligerent life forms.Yet another ant to crush between your finger and thumb.All it takes is one mistake, one underestimation of your opponent.Nature cares little for second chances.Trillions of drones would depart from the Sol system, scouting distant star systems and charting habitable worlds.The most dangerous species in the universe had been handed the greatest weapons of war available, and despite the galactic ban on artificial intelligence, the humans synchronized with their machines.Soon they would pour across the Milky Way, consuming all in their path.All the council races could do was pray, and fight for as long as they could.Humans didn't play fair, and had little mercy to offer these races.Old traditions of honor and pride didn't translate to the humans.Outwardly they would claim these qualities, but in practice there was only pragmatic brutality.Orbital bombardments, drone fleets, biological weapons, and the rarest and most devastating of forces, actual human deployment planet side.Messages were clear, so clear that no species needed a translator.Submit or die.Regardless of the alien's choice, most of the time the humans came to their own decisions about the fate of the galaxy.They decided they liked being the apex species of the Milky Way.True, there were plenty of worlds to share.Plenty of stars to capture, plenty of systems to mine and crack open, spilling out more materials than any one species could possibly hope to use.Except humans weren't prone to sharing.If there was one thing they hated more than themselves, it was the smattering of intelligent life that once sought their destruction.Most species would beg for mercy.Ask to serve, anything to avoid the extinction fleets of autonomous drones that would wipe an entire system of organic life in a few weeks time.Sometimes the humans listened.The majority of the time, they didn't.Perhaps if the galactic council had sought to control the amount of sapient life forms, the humans would have left them in peace.Instead of seeking to sterilize the Earth, seeking a peaceful coexistence.Maybe things would have ended differently.But human memories are long and complex.Their grudges thousands of years old, built on a million and one arbitrary differences that confounded and terrified the humans.Nothing motivates a human more than hate or fear or love.In targeting them all, the arbitrary differences seemed to melt away.Replaced by a deeper, darker yearning.A better Milky Way.A pure galaxy.A strong galaxy.A prosperous galaxy.A human galaxy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Where am I?*

The question is automatic, but so is the answer.*Dead.Squished.A meat crayon on a back road somewhere.Didn't even see the guy cross the median, or feel the impact.Once alive, now dead.*

*On and off.As easy as flicking a light switch.*

*But I'm somewhere, at least.Not nowhere.*

*So that's interesting.*

There's a room and a girl.Both small, cramped and cold.Her hair is dirty, unwashed and frizzy.Her arms thin and face slightly sunken.*Where am I?*

At a table.There's a mish-mash of plastic utensils and plates, all from seemingly random and disparate design.A pink teacup in front of me."More tea, Mr.Snuffles?"The girls voice is more a squeak than anything else.Absurdly, I pick up the cup and hold it outward as she takes a small white kettle and pours some pretend tea.*I'm supposed to be dead.I'm here, in a little girls room, having some kind of strange tea party, though I'm here and not here.Part of me is a corpse.*

*Part of me is something...else.*

"Uh, thank you."I say.At least my voice is normal.She drops the kettle, and it clatters onto the table."You've never talked back before," she says.Not afraid, no, she doesn't seem like the kind of girl prone to skittish fear.She's hunched over, like she's ready to run and hide at any moment.*Someone has hurt her.How?*

*How do I know?*

"Well, now I do, I think."It's a stupid thing to say, but I'm not entirely here right now.*Part corpse.Part air.Sitting in a little girl's chair.*

She smiles.Her teeth are crooked.We sit in silence, mimicking sipping tea.The room is surprisingly bare beyond old toys and dirty clothes.There are holes in some of the walls.Fist sized holes.There's a shout."Ashley!"The name is slurred, not spoken but spat.*He's going to hit her,* the thought comes unbidden.But true."Is that your daddy?"I ask."Yes.""Where's your mommy?""Daddy says I killed her."The girl says it flat and intoned.Something ingrained as an inevitable truth, something flattened and hammered."He comes up to remind me," she says again.Emotionless.*The man tells her this thing.The father tells the daughter.His wife and her mother died giving birth, and he has never forgiven her.He loves her.He hates her.He doesn't know what else to do.*

A man comes into the room, and I stand.He doesn't see me.*He doesn't know you.Part of you is dead, part of you is here.*

"There you are," he spits.Dead or not, I can smell booze.One step.Two steps.*Push him.*

*Why?I'm dead.Not here.Not really.*

*Push him.Push him now, push him hard.*

I push.The man is launched backwards, slamming into the wall and slumping forward, causing the girl to give a shout of surprise.In another moment I'm beside him, sitting next to him.*Don't do that again,* I whisper.*Don't ever try that again.*

His head jerks up, looking around, searching for a disembodied voice that he'll never find, never truly know.He begins to cry.An ugly, hoarse and hopeless thing.*He doesn't know why he does it.He doesn't question or bother.There's power in violence, and he uses it the only way he knows, from the only thing that can't hit him back.*

The girl is frozen in place, afraid of what is to come.She doesn't need to be afraid.She has me.I walk over and offer a hand, and hesitantly she takes it."When he gets up, him and I are going to have a talk, Ashley."She nods.We walk past him, the shaking man looking at bruised and calloused hands."Things should be better around here," I tell her, and mean it.*Imaginary friends, for those who need them the most.*

A voice from nowhere and everywhere.The girl smiles again, the crooked teeth and sunken eyes hopeful for the first time in a long time.*You can make the man change for the better.For the girl.For those who need their imaginary friends.*

Imaginary friends, or guardian angels.To me, the dead man who is here but not here, I find those things to be one and the same.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
