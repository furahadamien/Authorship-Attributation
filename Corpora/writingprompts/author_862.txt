Jesus take the wheel, Satan get behind me, and Buddha... man the .50 cal.We're set to ride this ship straight on into the sun.Many will stand in our path, though they will only be standing on the shoulders of others that they have convinced our intentions are impure.When we pass over all of them, as we rightly should, the true curvature and presence of this planet will reveal itself.We will see all lies told as the truth that hides behind them.We will see all impure people as the pure people they had the capacity, at one point, to be.Our hearts will continue to beat, and they will become louder.Not loud enough to capture the attention of those who are not listening, but quiet enough to reach the ears of those truly listening.Those who hear our pulse will be brought on board this shining ship.They will be fed the knowledge we have gained, and they will be delighted.It will taste the same as their first scoop of ice cream, it will be more refreshing than their first drink of water after a long hike through the forest.Together we will share the songs of our souls, we will uplift each other and become the only known image of the capacity of human minds and human hearts.
