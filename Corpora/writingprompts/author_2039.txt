Aleitheo
I hadn't risen out of the chair in months, at this point there was no need to.In the bed before me lay the only one I would ever need to keep an eye on again.Hooked up to machines that were struggling to keep his 254 year old body alive, his eyes closed to the world around him and the sterile whiteness of it all.I supposed it would make for a more calming greeting.An android entered the room, almost indistinguishable from a real human down to the emotions.Almost.As it walked towards the bed, leg moving through my incorporeal feet, I felt a sensation no different from when I pass through a door.This was the legacy that humanity would leave behind, these soulless machines that simply did not sit right with me at all.I toyed with the scythe in my hand, a symbol that had lost all meaning in this day and age.I kept it around for reasons, long forgotten some few thousand years after the real tool ceased to be made."Who are you?"I looked up at the bed, having not noticed the young man sitting up in it all of a sudden.He absent-mindedly brushed a lock of golden brown hair from his face as he eyed me up.My appearance was an amalgamation of ideas from throughout human history, their superstitions surrounding death.My garb was that of a 26th century doctor, back when humans still were employed in the role.Bracelets rattling on my wrists stood for each trial passed by some early history prophet and the book tethered at my waist I had taken to writing down the death of everyone I had helped from the beginning.I smiled back with the face that resembled someone, yet nobody in particular, someone that felt familiar, welcoming."I'm here to help you, last of the humans."Confusion gradually fell from his face as realisation kicked in.He knew he wasn't hallucinating, the drugs pumped into his body prevented that.He saw his dead body beneath him, prolonged much to far in life, prodded by one of the androids shouting for help.Yet he couldn't hear them, there was nothing but muffled echoes.He leapt out of bed with an agility he lost some seventy decades prior, running out of the room and down the corridor.I got up and walked, knowing full well where he would go there was no rush.He stood at a computer, crying as he read the words upon the screen.All the incubators before him had failed several years ago, the clones were long dead.As he wept I tried to recall the days I watched their lights turn to red one by one, each one lacking a soul.I honestly didn't know if they would have gained one at all.I didn't know if I would have wanted that."I tried, I really tried," he sobbed, noticing my presence.In the near one hundred millennia that I had been at this, I had never encountered a situation like this.I thought I had mastered the task of easing the deceased through the transition of death, but this?I was never prepared for this.
