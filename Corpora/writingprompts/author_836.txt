The most important thing a person can learn in life, is that Kinship is more important than Kin.Just because you're related to someone doesn't mean that they're your family.I'm saying this, because not long ago I learned where that distinction lay and how far a family will go to protect those they care about.As a kid, I thought I had super powers; the ability to turn invisible.I could go hours or even days without anyone acknowledging me or realizing I was in the room.But I eventually learned it was because I was the fourth kid out of seven, and living with parents who would scarcely be able to raise a single child, even if they chose to stop drinking away every cent they earned.I wasn't invisible, I was simply not worth noticing, which at least served to spare me from my parents sporadic bouts of rage in my younger years.But, once I was old enough to go to school, learn to read, and be able to pick up old, discarded novels from goodwill, I gained a new power.Teleportation.The power to go wherever a book could take me.To escape from my rotten life, my squalid home, and the strangers called my family who I was forced to inhabit it with.It was my little escape, something only I had, and something that nobody else could take from me, no matter how badly they wanted to.That much was made evident as I grew, I was finally noticed, and met by waves of insults and accusations from my parents and siblings.It was as much as I expected; that if I was reading, I must think I was better than them.That I had some kind of aspirations that I'd never have the potential to fulfill.How dare I want a better life than the particularly shitty hand I'd been dealt!It was one day when I was reading Jude the Obscure at goodwill, when I saw it happen.Scuttling across the floor, a tiny spider with only seven legs, barely escaping the stomping feet of the stores manager.For the first time ever, I felt that flash of kinship, where I felt like I understood someone.That spider and me, living in places neither of us liked and where no one wanted us, always unnoticed and even when we were, we became a problem.So, I did the only thing I could.I dashed over and cupped my hand, slamming it down over the spider and using my book to scoop them up before the shopkeeper could take another step.I exited with my new friend in hand and deposited him in the mess of webs nestled in the corner of the shops doorway.Every day from then on, no matter where I saw them, if there was a spider about to be killed or in danger, I'd make it a habit to stop, scoop them up and set them down outside or close to a crack or crevice they could make them a good home, sometimes even with a small word of advice.I could have sworn the little buggers stopped and looked up at me in response before shimmying their way into the relative safety of their webs and hiding holes.But I was already talking to them, so I guess it didn't seem that unusual at the time.It was the night of my sixteenth birthday when I found my true home.It was just coming on midnight when a pair of loud, blundering steps coming up the stairs signaled the conclusion of my parents drinking for that evening.Their obnoxious hyena laughter pulled me out of the book I was reading for just long enough to peer through the crack in my bedroom door and make eye contact with my boorish, drunken father.That was mistake number one.That was all the provocation he needed to come barrelling through the door, waking three of my other siblings in the process, eyes still fixed solely on me."Well look, if it isn't Einstein, still up reading his precious books at all hours of the night!"he breathed directly into my face, his nauseous stench wafting up my nostrils.I turned away and said nothing."What's the matter you little shit?Spent so much time with your head in them books that you've forgotten how to speak?Lydia!Come see!We've made one so stupid that he can't even speak anymore!"he belched back to my equally intoxicated mother, who promptly stumbled in, giggling like an idiot.I did my best to continue ignoring them; but my silence seemed to motivate them, to try and get a reaction out of me, more than anything.Their attempts became increasingly desperate and furious, spitting, cursing and yelling, but I still refused to acknowledge them.That's when my father took my book and I finally reacted.That was mistake number two."You think these are gonna help you where you're gonna end up, huh?"he gloated, dangling the book in front of my as I attempted to swipe it away before he could pass it to my mother."Because they're not!You're going to end up amounting to nothing, working for nothing pay in this nothing city and having kids who amount to nothing just!like!you!"he barked, prodding my chest with each word for emphasis and glaring angrily."So let me do you a favour and help get rid of that pesky ambition for ya!"That's when my father opened my book and, with a look of glee on his face, violently and systematically tore out every last page.That one act unlocked the floodgates on sixteen years of repressed anger and neglect, and for the first time in my life, I stood up for myself."That's where you're wrong!I'm not going to do any of that, because I'm not staying in this shithole for a second longer!"I yelled, barging past my worthless parents and towards the stairs."And I'm glad you two found some relief in drinking rather than reading!"I added as I took my first step downstairs."This way, you'll be dead at least fifteen years earlier than I was hoping!"That was mistake number three.I didn't feel the bottle smash over the back of skull as much as I heard it, and then the stairs suddenly rushed upwards to meet me.I could feel myself tumble down the steps roughly, bumping and twisting as I fell, but it all felt as if it was happening to somebody else and I was sort of watching it from afar.I came to stop suddenly on something soft, too soft to be the stairs or floor, lying face up as I saw my father coming down the stairs, the bloodied and broken half of the bottle still in his hand.My head lolled and my eyes felt like they were being weighted down as I lay there, the edges of my perception becoming blurred; but the last thing I remember before I lost consciousness was the image of my father looking down at me and suddenly screaming out as he slipped and was seemingly dragged down the stairs by the shadows that rapidly swallowed my vision.When I awoke, I was resting on something soft and white, what I initially thought might have been a hospital bed.But when I sat up, and saw the millions of tiny legged creatures surrounding me, I knew it was no hospital bed.My head pounded viciously, but when I put my hand back to inspect the wound, I found it to be bandaged in the same silky white material that I was sleeping on, with a few spiders seemingly there to keep the compress clean and secure.Hearing a slight shuffling to my side, I turned to see the spiders were carrying in a book for me, Jude the Obscure to be precise, and resting atop it was an especially small fellow with only seven legs.I took the book from them, my seven legged friend seemingly trying to wiggle his way in between the pages.I opened it to the page he was trying to reach, and he began to do the most amazing thing.He would scuttle back and forth between the same words seven words over and over again, tapping his little front legs on the ones he wanted me to see.They read as thus:
