I_Want_In_Too
I knew exactly what that letter meant on the bedside table."Michelle!", I yelled."Emergency, Emergency!Lay back!"We laid back down on our bed and the straps automatically held us down.I thought of the scene in 'The Goonies' when they slide down to the pirate ship.But, I had no idea where our tunnel would lead.We just slid.The tunnel was dim, but lit the whole way down.Ups and downs, curves, and loop-d-loops.Eventually we started slowing down and surprisingly, we drop again.Out of the tunnel and into the 1960's Batmobile.My Michelle and I looked at each other, smile, and we put on our masks.I couldn't hear her scream as I peeled away towards the symbol on the sky.[edit] Dedicated to Batman's real creator, Bill Finger.Deleted a sentence.
