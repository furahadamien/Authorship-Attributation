Notice_Me_Not
Hello all, it's my first time posting on reddit at all, so I'm a little nervous!I changed the bit about the Grim Reaper being the first human to die, hope that's ok.Thanks!&#x200B;

It was the pain that hit Jamie first.Not the physical, gnawing pain of the gaping hole where his stomach had once been.No, it was the deep, visceral longing that he had for someone, anyone towhat?Soothe his fears?Piece him back together?Witness his last breaths?At this stage he didnt know.He forced his bleary eyes away from the red ooze slowly spilling from his stomach.He watched it puddle and mingle with the dry, yellow ground below him.It was empty.The clearing he was in was completely devoid of life.The trees in the distance were barren.The ground he laid on was parched.No birds.No insects.No humans.Even his "killer" had left him.He couldnt help a bitter smile sneaking its way onto his mouth as he recalled the kids terrified face.A small, quivering voice, asking if he was, Okay, mister? 

He had choked a laugh and said, Kid, get out of here before youre caught. He knew that no one would have known what had just happened.No one would know that some pea-brained kid had taken his fathers shotgun to practice shooting dear.No one would have heard the cry of anguish from the child as he realised thatno, he had not fatally wounded a dear.The child was a mess.Sobs broke their way out of his chest after the initial paralysing shock had worn off.Tiny hands hovered over Jamie's stomach, almost touching.No one would ever know.As he felt his grip on consciousness slipping, it occurred to him that watching someone die before him will certainly scar the kid for the rest of his life.Well, more than the kid would already be after having killed someone accidentally and all.The kid trembled, knobbly knees scratched by hard earth beneath them.He seemed reluctant to leave.Jamie heaved a sigh.And then immediately regretted it as unimaginable pain radiated throughout his entire body.His hands scrapped uselessly against the dirt and his body writhed.Unbidden, a groan slipped past his lips.The kid needed to go.Kid, listen, you need to leave.Now, he sputtered out.But The kid protested, words choked and head bowed.The blinding yellow of the sun made it hard for Jamie to look the kid in the eye.Anger snaked its way through Jamies gut and his control snapped, Leave before you cause any more damage. The words were little more than a whisper but they worked.The kid reared back as if he had been physically struck.Guilt tried to wheedle its way into Jamies chest but he pushed it aside.This had to be done!Go.Please, with that last plead, the kids eyes became shuttered, his lip stopped trembling and he scurried away.A trail of dust was kicked up in his wake.Blue, pain-filled eyes watched as it settled.No tracks were left.No evidence of another single living soul.Jamie cursed himself as he recalled his reasoning for going on this trip in the first place.*You wanted to get out of your head for a bit.* The voice mocked him.He spared a look at the state of his stomach, or what was left of it, and had to swallow back bile.There was no recovering from this.His rapidly weakening strength, clouding vision, and shallowing breaths were testament enough to that.The pain he could handle.It was starting to become blessedly numb.He didnt know how long this took but he surmised it was a while.He had watched the barren land slowly become engulfed by darkness.Everything was dark.He could no longer see anything around him.He had tried calling out for help earlier.He knew it was futile but he kept screaming until his throat was raw and his voice refused to cooperate.No one heard him.No one was here, it pierced his chest and cut deeper than the wound he was dying from.Memories of the past plagued him, taunting him cruelly.Ghostly spectres of his mother and father demanded answers, asking how he could leave them.His brothers face, painted in anguish, screaming for him to come back.A deep ache filled his chest.It was then, with this longing, that the first tears began to fall.Deep shuddering breaths were the only sounds to pierce the silence.*I dont want to die alone.I dont want to die alone.*

He prayed that the dancing tendrils of death lurking at the edge of his mind would hurry the fuck up and take him already.It was the emptiness that was killing him.No one to hear his pain, his last moments.At least his family didnt have to witness this suffering, he thought, as he exhaled his last breath.Finally, letting his eyes close.Finally able to rest.Britany blinked her eyes open as sound returned to her slowly at first.A siren pierced her ears.People rushing.People crying.Red and blue lights came into focus along with a line of yellow tape.She seatbelt cut into her chest and she tried to move it but it was stuck.She tried to catch the attention of the paramedic in front of her.Dead on impact, The paramedic stood right in front of her, writing information down in a notepad.*What?Im alive, you fucking moron!*

Such a shame, she was so young, Another paramedic replied, and walked off to speak with a police officer.No!No!She felt panic surge within her, tears spilled down her cheeks as she desperately tried to free herself from the car.Nails tore and bled as they scratched and pulled at the seatbelt.Stop, A calm voice advised her.A sudden calmness filled her and her struggles ceased.She looked up.Before her stood man about her own age, his red hair flaming against the dying sun, and eye a calming blue.Everything faded into the background.You can see me? She asked, confusion spiralling within her, But they said I was dead! She said, gesticulating wildly towards the bustling crowd of uniformed workers.Hope blossomed within her as she spotted her family behind the yellow tape.Waving frantically, she yelled, Im ok!.Her mother was sobbing into her fathers shoulder, as her brother crossed his arms, his face shuttered.But she could see his hands trembling.They ignored her.Her eyebrows met in confusion as she turned to face the blue-eyed stranger.They cant see you, he stated, laying a hand on her shaking shoulder.It was then that clarity hit her.She was dead.She had died in a car accident.She was alone.No you arent, a voice broke through the haze of her thoughts, You wont suffer alone. The burning which had been steadily building in her chest was doused.She didnt have to face this, whatever this was, by herself.She felt a slow smile slip onto her face as she placed her hand in his.She wasnt alone.Thanks to Jamie.
