Subject 13 let out a sound that could only be described as a heavy pant.Its motions were labored and slow but determined.Padding through the woods, it leaned against a tree both to try and get its bearings and to take a rest.The moment didn't last long.The crackling of sticks nearby warned him that the human was coming his direction.It continued, swatting at branches and cursing every dried leaf and every tiny twig that bellowed out his location to the hunter."Oh, Alien!"yelled the man."Alieeeeen," he continued, drawing out the word in a playful taunt.Subject 13 tried to keep going but found his legs unable to keep pace with the pounding of its heart.They were fueled by nothing but fear, and while in abundance, it wasn't enough any more.It tumbled.The human appeared above him."Hi, little guy!"said the man with a chipper disposition."You know, I always found it odd that aliens resembled humans.Like..." his mind trailed off as he focused more on stepping on the alien's wrist to keep it from moving.It writhed in agony and terror, but the man's weight was too much."... are we a version of you?Or are you a version of us?"He stepped on the other wrist, straddling the fallen invader.Looking down with a large smile on his face, he continued, "I understand it's probably panspermia.What a funny name, right?So I get that we're both probably related, but I always expected real aliens to be more akin to Sagan's version, where they look nothing like humans."He squatted down.Subject 13 wriggled placidly.The man pulled out a 6\-inch hunting blade from its sheath.The random strands of sunlight filtered by the large evergreens glistened off the blade, giving it an air of beauty."I'm sorry to say, but I know your little secret.When you get scared, you let out a little pheromone that signals your buddies.And that's why the government hired me."He reached over and grabbed Subject 13's hand and laid the blade against its pinky.It was so sharp that just a touch, and green liquid welled at the contact point."Because I'm the master of fear, little guy.Now, I'm gonna tell you a secret: I don't actually give two shits about Matt Damon.No.I mean, he was great in those *Ocean's* movies, and I think his water.org work is fantastic.But that's not why I took this job.No."He smiled like a kid who got the Christmas present he always wanted."I took it, because I'm going to cut you to pieces.Not for science.Not for Matt Damon.No."With a quick slice, the pinky fell off.Subject 13 let out a sound the likes of which had never been heard on this earth.The man laughed."Just because I want to."
