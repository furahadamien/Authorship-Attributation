There she stood in front of me, tall, blonde, muscular, in a black leather jacket surrounded by a crowd of people carrying guns, my former lab partner, but somewhat older than she would have been if she had gone from and to the same time as I had, but only slightly."Robin?How did you do this?"I asked, completely baffled."Well man, it is just that you left me some of your early notes in the lab, and a year after you were gone, that really peaked my interest.So I tryed to work from that.I got here ten days ago with a few machine guns and took over this little duchy, I am currently rewamping their political system before I want to go on, and I could need your help with that."She said.One of the men behind her said something in old german I barely understood."What...talking?"Was all I got.Robin responded."I just told him that I'd tell him later what we talk about.""So, what do you want to archive here?How are you going to rewamp this society?"I asked, trying to understand what was going on."Well, that is where you come in."She told me, focusing on me again."I was foolish enough to try to build my time machine so that it could transport a shittonne of stuff, it was as big as a car.Actually, there is the car I arrived in."She was pointing toward a hut, smiling."Behind that thing.So, I got way too exited when I managed to send something forward that I lost all caution, so I packed my clothes, ten AKs and a bag of hygene into my car, drove it into the time machine and remotely activated the time machine.Transporting so much through time and space was a bad idea.The time machine overheated, I am happy I am stillalive, though I planned on arriving next to Alexander the great.For my plan to work though, I need to get a lot of stuff here.So, here is what we do: you go back and forth through time and grab the things I need and will have all the benifit I have.""And what will that be?"I asked, I didn't want to life in a dictatorship, even if it was my dictatorship."Well, we are going to build a city here, where everybody is his own king in abundance."She replied."So, fully automated luxury communism?"I asked."Yes."She replied."So, what do you need?"I said as my time machine again started to make noises, then there dropped a gun and a shitload of ammo.I grabbed all of it and hung the gun around my shoulder.The people around Robin had taken a few steps back."Protection."I said."I didn't expect a castle to be right in front of where I landed, after all, there was nothing but forest on the map.""Yeah, this was a secret fortress, only known to a few messengers, that made it easyer to take over, at least after I had convinced the king not to mess with me."She said."So, what stuff do you want?"I asked.I was going to work with her.I knew that now."By the way, If we are going to build citys, not here, try to take over some place that isn't mostly nature.""For now I need solar power, is this thing big enough to transport Solar panels?"She asked.I responded by activating the screen on the side."Dave, can we transport solar panels?"I asked."You know, we had a scedule, right?"He responded as my bagpack dropped into the time machine."You can contact our time from here?"She asked.She walked over in front of the screen."Hey Dave!"
