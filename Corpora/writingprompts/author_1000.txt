PeeplesPepper
"If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off?"barron was a shepard of sorts too, and he went after the sheep.He folded his wiry glasses and oversized ledger with a click and thud respectively.Balance $86,400.It had been a long haul up to this point and Barron set a new high for his net worth by 6 dollars.In actual fact, he would have hit this gilded milestone 1 year 6 months and 18 days earlier, but he had spent less time running the business and more time hunting down a thief.Someone had been stealing from Barron and he'd known it for 3 quarters now.His connection to money was supernatural, adding, subtracting, transferring, compounding interests and paying debts with a savants gut instinct.He never knew what the balance exactly was supposed to be, only of it was off.He didn't sleep right that whole quarter...something was off.(More later maybe)
