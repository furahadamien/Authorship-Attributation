I always thought that movies were overly theatrical when, in a moment of shock, the protagonist would drop his glass of champagne to shatter dramatically on the floor.Now, with Dom Perignon soaking into my carpet and the soles of my slippers, I wondered if I wasnt just overly shocked.I had known for some time that there was something different about me.Something special I had just thought feelings like that were the realm of fifteen-year-old girls, not 65-year-old men.I had ignored them.I scolded myself now as I refocused my attention on the scrapbook of newspaper clippings before me.There I was, headlining most of them.*The United Nations formally recognizes Muninn, a powerful telepath and telekinetic, as the supervillain mostly responsible for the 2008 stock market crash when he imbalanced the real estate market through subtle influence of major financial institutions.* 

*Is Muninn the Supervillain Responsible for Deteriorating Relations Between U.S. and North Korea?*

*Dr. Charles Kingley  better-known as Muninn, president of the recently self-proclaimed International League of Villains  is finally captured with the help of hero CleanSlate, who promises to wipe the mans memory and return him safely to society.This could be a new era for international prison reform*

A scowl shot across my features as I ran my hand through my thick white hair.A dirty trick, wiping the mind of a telepath and telekinetic.I reached out and the brown paper that had once wrapped the scrapbook drifted lazily up into my hand.There was something comforting and familiar about using my powers, as though a part of me that had been missing was suddenly returned.Id never lost my abilities, I realized.Id simply forgotten to try and use them.Someone had sent me this scrapbook, hoping to trigger my memory to return.Someone wanted Muninn back, but who?There was no clue on the wrapper, no return address, and I turned my attention back to the scrapbook.Flipping to the last page I saw a note that Id missed when my mind had been overwhelmed with a rush of returning memories.It was short message, written in a feminine hand that some part of my mind recognized.*Welcome back, Charles.Love, H.*

I struggled to recall a name to attach to the handwriting, but that was something my mind wasnt ready to give back just yet.The scowl deepened as I realized how long a road I had ahead of me.Someone had answers, and I wouldnt stop until I found them.
