[short on purpose, an homage]  
  
God says nothing to Johnny, letting his fiddle do the intimidating.He launches into a brief fiddle solo to show his power.He finishes by thrusting his fiddle and bow to his sides while simultaneously lunging his body towards Johnny as if to say, "Can you handle this?"Johnny, tired from a long day of defeating the Devil down in Georgia, decides that he is too exhausted to battle again.Being resourceful, he reaches into his shirt, pulls out his revolver, and shoots God dead on the spot.()

When Johnny shot God got he gave a nod  
and motioned to the crowd.When God fell down on to the ground  
It made 'ol Johnny proud.He said, in jest, "I am the best  
So put away your phones.You haven't seen the likes of me  
Since Indiana Jones."
