When The Blinding had occurred most had been asleep.It happened at exactly 2:57:34 AM CST, on the fourth of August, 2020.The event was gradual, like the dimming of lights, before flickering, and finally, I was unable to see.Sounds like the house shifting became more apparent, and the soft snore of my boyfriend filled the room.I deduced that I was tired, and closed out of the drawing application that my laptop was on.I gave my boyfriend a quick kiss (at that point it seemed as though I could see, just very little) on the forehead before dozing off beside him.The next morning as we awoke to the utter catastrophe that was blindness we heard screaming from the apartment next to ours.Perhaps it wasnt just us?As we switched on the news I realized.This is happening everywhere.Eventually, over the span of two years the world adapted.Service dogs were a requirement for all, and could easily help.However we realized we were in danger when people began getting sick.After one bump in the road, and then another... and another... we finally got going.As I entered the hospital I felt a rush of cold air wash over me.A sudden tingle at the back of my head.I rushed outside, quickly running home.Something was wrong...

My boyfriend (now Fianc) heard me enter the door.Whats wrong Gabe? He asks.Im out of breath.My vision is coming back.I choke on the words.Then I see it.Dont tell them you can see. I tilt my head.Then look over at Ryan.His usually muscular look had been downgraded to sickly, and pale...But something else was wrong.It felt like when you left your backpack at home as a kid.It wasnt right, you just didnt know why.Then I spotted him.Lean, black, wispy.A human face.No.A deer head.Long, sharp antlers, long legs, and an expensive wristwatch.His eyes were a crimson red, and one had an arrow show through.He glanced over and I stared blankly at the wall.Unmoving.Unblinking.He got up from his relaxed position.Sharp, pointed fingers reaching out, clawing at my neck.It appears that youve failed the challenge.
