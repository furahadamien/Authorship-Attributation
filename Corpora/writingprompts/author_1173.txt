He held the weapon up to the light."Yes, yes.But is this TRULY the weapon of a warrior?A true Einjerarharen should die with the blood of their enemies on their blade."The quiet man standing before the gods in a set of chef's whites shrugged."It served well enough, up to that last one.""It's so...small.""Brothers and sisters, we are not here is discuss whether a weapon has value.We are here to discuss whether this warrior should enter Valhalla.""Oh, give it a rest, Hilda.You know damned well we need no cooks in the Halls of glory.""Says you.Personally I'd be happy if we had someone who knew how to make something more complicated than some variation of an animal stuck on a pole and rotated over a fire.""I do a very nice quiche from time to time.""Ooooh!""Do not speak again unless spoken to, mortal, or it will go hard for you."Another shrug."So that counts as being spoken to does it?""What did I JUST SAY?""You said that I should not speak unless spoken to.Was I wrong in your interpretation?""Do not question the gods, you puling weakling.""Technically, Thor, he DID slay fifteen warriors armed far better than he with this...object.""I fail to see how.You, how could you slay such as these....three persons...with this...spatch-cu-lah?""Triads.They're called Triads.Criminals who think they own all of the people in my neighborhood.As far as the spatula?You have to sharpen the edge to do the right kind of chop on certain things so you don't need to move back to the chopping block.Easier.Plus, I trained as a hibachi chef.""Still, this is not the weapon of a warrior!This was
...a kitchen boy's fight!""They killed my sous chef.And they messed up my mis en place.""Worthy reasons, to be sure.""Pfah.Mis en place?What is this?""The layout that allows you to do the work you must do without running all over the place.The tools of your work.And they messed.It.Up.""Calm yourself.""Calm.Calm?You sit there pretending that it's EASY to design a full menu, feed hundreds in a night while still managing a staff of twenty people, half of whom are charged up on cocaine, the other half still hungover from whatever they had the night before, the whole sweatbox a giant bottle of nerves?This isn't a godsdamned diner, this is cuisine.This is gastronomy.And either you get it right or you get it wrong, and every second counts.You sit there with your idiotic hammer and blades that haven't been properly sharpened in YEARS from the look of things and you DARE to tell me that I should CALM myself?""I like him.He definitely qualifies under 'berserker'.""What is this quiche thing he mentioned?""Eggs cooked in a pie, as far as I can tell.With a pastry crust, often filled with other ingredients like hanging, spinach, and..."

"Yes, yes, I can see you have the Wikipedia entry open under the table, Sigrun.But what to do with him?""We have, perhaps, focused improperly upon the usage of a weapon, friends.""Oh, yes, let's hear from LOKI.We all know you're just itching to contribute.""Thank you, Illustrious Thor.Perhaps you could give us the definition of a warrior.""He who fights for glory and honor, to defend or uphold their home and country.""Is not this man's home his workplace?Sir, how many hours do you spend there?""Any time I'm not sleeping, ordering food, or whatever?""I should say, then, it is your home.And what are the weapons of a farmer?The sickle, the axe, the spear.We were born from farmer's glory, fellow immortals.We are the gods of hearth and home.Our daggers can be used to cut flesh or to chop wood.Hammer to build or to destroy.An axe to chop or to cleave.What is the weapon other than the extension of the will of the hand that holds it?""This is a trickery, Loki.""No, brother.It is logic and reason.""Like I said, trickery.""It is not.Watch his death.He wields his weapon as a sword.He fights them with these strange knives, used as an axe.He reaches into the throat of this one with it and cleanly removes it from this life.It is this one with the weapon that shoots tiny darts..."

"Bullets, actually.""Bullets, then...this one who strikes a final blow with this coward's weapon.As he lunges forth, he brings the weapon down and removes the offending hand at the elbow."His heart ceases to beat, the bodies of fifteen slain and one given a coward's reward by removing his weapon hand.And you say that simply because he wields a weapon you cannot understand or use that he should not achieve Valhalla?""I can understand it fine.""Prove it, brother.Wield the spatula and show your skill.""I will not.A woman's weapon.""Excuse me?""....a weakling's weapon, Freya, is what I meant to say.""Fifteen dead, one humiliated for life?""You cannot trick this into reality!I have the veto and I shall use it!""Then we are at an impasse, and we shall remain here until it resolves.He cannot return unless given life again by the gods, and he binds us to the place of judgement until we decide.And I shall not decide for him to go to any real except to Midgaard or to Valhalla.""..."

"Brother, you are NOT keeping us from the feast.No.""Why bother?It's the same every night.No, I shall not allow him to leave just because you're hungry.""You forget.You're the only one who actually LIKES the food.""I for one wouldn't mind trying one of these...croissants?""Yes.Something from France.The Gauls.""So, can you tell us more about it, mortal?""No.But I can certainly tell you everything I know about being a chef.About twenty years' worth.""So, Thor, are you saying you want to sit through twenty years of... culinary training?""All right.Fine.Give him his little toy back.He can return to Midgaard.If he dies as a true warrior I myself shall find him and bring him to Valhalla.""And if the Master of Weapons says that this is a weapon of a warrior...?""Then I shall give no objection.""Excellent.I also recommend that we take a sample of this mortal's food to the All-Father.As a precedent.""No!I forbid it!""Oops, are ravens supposed to eat human food?""Are you...you did that on purpose, Loki!""My hand must have slipped.One wonders why they eat egg dishes, though.They are birds, after all.""They are not chickens.""True enough.Well, mortal warrior, the consensus is this: you're getting sent back.If you can figure out how to die again with a weapon in your hand you belong in Valhalla, and Junior Meathead over there won't bother putting up the red velvet rope on you.But we aren't sending you back as you died.That just isn't sporting.""Wait, that's fifteen Triads...."

"Oh, no, I should have mentioned.We are sending you back with a few Einjerarharen of your own.A dozen should do it, you think?""These guys don't give up easily.""Ah.Perhaps thirty, then.And as a punishment for your sin, you must teach them all the way of the Chef.""...so you ARE sending me to hell.""Of course not.She has no sense of taste.Besides, with enough training, perhaps we can improve some of the feasts up here in the next century or so.Farewell, mortal."And that's how the local dining scene truly became dominated by smorgasbord restaurants.
