"So you're telling me that every US President is still alive?""Oh heavens no, Barack."John chuckled."They are all very much dead.Anyone saying otherwise is technically committing treason.The the existence of the Dead President Society is a state secret that is protected in the constitution.You'd be surprised what you can hide in a document no one actually reads all the way through.""But are they all here?"Barack asked, rephrasing the question to avoid word games."Only those with remarkable abilities.Which, surprisingly, is most of them.""So...Lincoln?""Alive.You probably know him as Bill Nye.""What?"Obama stopped walking, doing a double take."Don't tell me you never suspected?The bone structure didn't give it away?""So do dead presidents do that often, set up personas in plain sight?""Sometimes."The two walked in silence for a while before Barack's curiosity bubbled over."So what exactly do we do.""The DPS mainly focusses our efforts into protection of the American People from threats both Paranormal and Extraterrestrial.Knowing this, you have two options.One, you wake up with no recollection of this, the note, any of it.You can go back to your retirement and enjoy it in peace.Or two, you join us.You will no longer exist.You will officially be dead, but you will see things beyond your wildest dreams or nightmares... what do you say?"

They say that with great power comes great responsibility.They say it an awful lot.It seems they do not hold themselves to the same maxim.They are perpetual children, born of a hellish world.They are tall and wiry and somehow far more resilient than their spindly limbs and narrow frames suggest.They eat poison and drink acid, delight in danger and chaos, and find it utterly hilarious to play elaborate practical jokes.They made there presence known to us by broadcasting three signals at us at once.The first was easy, a simple binary replacement that, when decoded turned out to be a book.The second used the book as one piece in a three part decryption key, to reveal a set of spatial co-ordinates corisponding to a spot on our nearest moon and a timestamp.Traveling to that point at the specified time got us blueprints and codes for a machine that could translate the third signal...The third signal which, by this point, had been being broadcast at our world for 2 whole years...It was a looped audio recording of a long and reverberating bout of flatulence.
