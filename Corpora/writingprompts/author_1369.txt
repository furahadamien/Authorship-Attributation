The pyramid is nearly complete.The Pharoah proudly struts around the base of the massive golden structure giving a holler here and there.I and my partner began pushing one of the several needed blocks to finish the top level.This stone was much larger than the rest, we estimated around 9 tons.With ropes attached and men in place we began to slide it up the slope.I had always prided myself on being one of the stronger laborers but today I was sluggish from a cut and infected toe, which was apparent as the men groaned in agony trying to move the stone.The harder I pushed the more pain I felt in my foot and towards my big toe.I couldn't take it anymore.The Pharoah set his gaze upon me as I let out a blood curdling shriek.The stone stopped, I stopped, and my partner began pushing with all his might to hold it in place.The men with ropes let out a howl as they gave it one more pull with every last ounce of strength they had left.We were at the top now, when suddenly, the rope snapped.My partner jumped off the slope as the stone went right over my feet and crushed my body.I felt a rush of intense pain like an ocean wave crashing over me.Every nerve ending released its self with the maximum amount of pain as they shut off, one by one, from my feet to my head.In an instant there was darkness.I opened my eyes to find I had no emotions.The feelings I had been experiencing were gone.3857364htugut736, with his cyborg dreadlocks made from cables and wires, gazed into my glowing red eyes.We stared for what felt like an eternity as I thought of absolutely nothing.An entire sun was birthed and exploded in the time I waited.Finally, as if nothing had happened, he extended his dreads towards mine and we connected.I had noticed he was connected with others as well.I heard no words, but got a strong feeling inside.A burning sensation could be felt under my eyelids as I began to have the uncontrollable urge to ask "how was it?"How was it I thought?How was what, the painful yet beautiful biological life of a human?The tedious task of eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, reproducing, birthing, happiness, and sadness.I had never experienced time in such a fast pace.I had never thought it were possible to feel emotions.3857364htugut736 nodded, and took a hit from the neon blue glowing bong.Another sun was birthed, and as I watched it over the course of millions of years develop, I couldn't help but realize, I felt nothing.Edit: never done this before I'm absolutely not a writer.I'm going through a really rough divorce and can't see my kids right now.Writing this took my mind off things for a bit and reading the stories here made me cry a lot which felt good.Thanks for reading I hope someone out there actually enjoyed that.I think I have grammar problems and tense problems.
