This is my first ever short story?Here goes.Sorry if it's a mess :/

I woke up to the sound of sheer shrills and gleeful laughter."Ah, honey, it must be Christmas."I said, as I rolled over to cuddle with my wife a bit more."Mhm" She responded, clearly not wanting to get up.She and I spent all night preparing the food and presents for our daughter and relatives.I gave her one last cuddle and sat up, preparing for the family to arrive."Man, why did we have to have it at our house this time?Why not at Becky's or Steve's?They're the ones with bigger houses!"I complained, slowly getting up and feeling my knees creak."MOMMY!DADDY!"Sally roared, "A PONY!A PONY!"My eyes shot towards the window as I hurriedly walked towards it.I look outside and saw it.A brimstone horse grazing my front lawn, and my daughter bouncing around it.The horse clearly didn't clearly give a shit about her."Honey, HONEY!"I yelled, "YOU NEED TO GET UP HONEY!""Give me five dammit!"Miranda mumbled

"There's a fucking HORSE outside!"I exasperated 

Her eyes shot open."What?"She got up to look at me.Bafflement was etched into her face.I started making my way downstairs at mach 5, "Get some clothes on!I'm going to get Sally!"I yelled

As I made my way downstairs, all I could hear was Sallies glee.Well, at least she got that.I slammed open the door to bear witness the full glory of this horse.It's color was brimstone and these clear horns grew out the side of it's head, his mane was a deep crimson flame all the way down to it's tail.The grass around it was turning crispy, it's hooves leaving molten grass and dirt in it's wake.As I started my approach my foot slammed into an object."Ow, what the fuck?Who left this bric..." I trailed off and my gaze wandering downward.Near my foot was this nice crimson leather box, with a white parchment on the front with words blazing on it.I reached down and lifted the box back up to me and looked at the physical impossibility.The words were OPEN ME."Daddy, daddy!Can we keep him?CAN WE KEEP HIM!?!"She gleefully roared."Uh..Hold on dear."I mumbled.I opened the box and fiery puff of smoke came out, I reeled back so that it doesn't go in my face.Looking down in the box I saw a black leather bridle and a brush.Under it all a note was at the bottom."Hey, Daddy, whose that?"Sally questioned."What?"I replied looking up.Standing before me was a man wearing a rich crimson striped suit, the stripes flickering like little candle flames.His skin was a deep brown and his eyes burned red.His hair was a nicely kept ponytail.On his face was a mustache and goatee."Hello, Sally!"His voice hummed, "Do you like my present?""YES!Are you Sandy Claws?"she gleefully asked, her eyes wide with astonishment."Why...yes I am!"He carefully answered, "I had to come here this time for a present I forgot about.""Present!?"Sally squealed!"You got me another present?!""Yes, I did!You got to have something to sit on while riding Princess don't you?"he explained and stepped back.On the ground near his feat was a saddle dyed black, just like the bridle in the box.He picked up the saddle and fit it on the beast, "Splendid!"he said as he finished doing the fastens.He picked up my child and put her on Princess, "Now, Sally, your dad and I have somethings we must discuss, can you take Princess to the back yard?"He asked.As if on queue the horse started making it's way to the back yard."Well then."he finished."Wha...what is that?"I dumbfoundingly asked."What?Never seen a horse before?He snarkily replied."Never like that!"I snapped back."What did you give to my daughter?""A horse you moron."He said while face palming "It's not going to hurt her.""How in the fuck am I supposed to know that?!"I yelled."Who do you think I am?"He replied angerily."You're....Sant-?"I tried saying."Don't."He snapped, "You know exactly who I am."Sigh, "Satan."I defeatedly admitted."Satan."He flatly answered."Now, on the topic of dear Sally, I must say she is one of the sweetest girls I have ever met!Normally I don't get those types of letters.Really once a thousand years, so I came personally to thank her."He said."You know damn well she meant Santa."I replied."Hey, a letter is a letter, especially one addressed to me."He said, finishing with a smile.His teeth razor sharp points."Now, really, whose fault is it that a letter got sent to ME?"he smartassedly asked."Sigh...mine."I answered."Haha, there it is!"He laughed, underneath it you can hear a faint hiss."Now, I tell you what, normally I make a "deal".You know, the whole shebang."He explained, "BUT, since it's the spirit of ol' saint nick, that old bastard, I've decided maybe, just maybe, I'll be a bit benevolent..."

"So, there won't be a deal?"I asked

"Yes.""Oh thank god."I stupidly said.Satan's face scrunched up and his eyes burned red.His face looked like utter disgust."Really man, gotta bring him here?"he angrily said."Right, sorry."I replied

"Damn, maybe you want a deal."he said."No, no last time that...." I absentmindedly said."Hey, hey, where are we?"He interjected.I realized my mistake.But you just can't not answer Satan himself."We're....We're in Georgia.." I quietly answered."What was that?"He excitedly asked?"Georgia."I answered.Man, why the hell am I an idiot?"Hoo boy."He laughed menacingly, "You wouldn't happen to know how to play a damn mean fiddle would you?""Fuck."I answered.
