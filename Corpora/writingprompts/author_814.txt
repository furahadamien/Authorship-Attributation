Trumpets blasted in the air.The sound was making the hairs on my skin stand up straight.That plus the view of millions of people screaming and running towards a group of demons.I tried to keep up while the first humans reached the demons.They may have been dead already but the demons made sure nothing was left.Their claws and teeth went straight true the weak human flesh and bones.How would we ever win this war?What change did we have against fallen angels?Demons from hell?It was Alexander the Great himself who had set up this battle plan.Him and his valuable generals.All old rulers themself.Some ruled parts of the earth so long ago nobody rememberd them.Others where more from my time.Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Qadaffi, Putin and so many more.Over the last 53 years they had worked on a plan to take over Hell itself.First in secret but 53 years is a long time.Slowly their plans started to leak and more and more people wanted to help.Their centuries of experience in battle came together in todays plan.And here i was running.Just running towards demons.Was that the best they could do?I mean i wouldnt mind getten ripped in peaces.Hell was shitty anyway, but serieus?This was it?At that moment i saw how thousands of humans run over a demon.We where simply to many and to fast.As soon as the dirst demon fell more followed.A deep raw sounded true the vallei of dead.We millions of humans felt a victory.We screamend, we yelled.My feet stepped into blood and bones.Human but also demon.I could smell it.Was this it?Was this how we would take over hell?At that moment a sound so deeply, so frightening sounded.It made our voices sound like mouses.Again the hair on my skin stood up but this time because of fair.Everybody knew this sound.It was the Devil himself.The angel of death.The nightmare of us all.A shadow casted itself over us.And far above us an dragon like beast apeared.It moved closer.Fastly.While the shadow got darker i saw how in the distance Alexander moved his hands.So far away but still so powerfull.Did he have a plan for this?It must be.Fire came down from satan his mouth.Burning so many of us.It left a burnend highway of ashes towards the end of vallei.With a sharp movement he turned around.Ready for a second run.Right at that moment earth disappeared and man build machines popped up.Stones attached to ropes made of humanparts got shot towards the Devil.Attacking him from the back.At the same time humans riding captured demons flew in, attacking this almighty beast from every side.At that moment i myself reach a demon and fight for my dead.Alone i would not stand a change, but we are with so many.I get pushed against the demon and can barely breath.All i can do is bite.So i bite.I will eat myself true his revolting skin.It tastes like nothing i ever tasted before.So discusting, so intense.I feel my bones in my body breaking from all the preasure.I keep eating.I scream, i bite, i cry, i dig.Slowly it gets dark before my eyes.
