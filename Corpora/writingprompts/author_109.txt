She was beautiful.Samantha's curvy chocolate locks flowed over her shoulders, eyes piercing and lavender.I'd only just met her, we lined up for a special premiere called 'Your Life'.She looked me up and down as we progressed through the entrance into the lobby where all kinds of smartly dressed men and women were waiting to be seated."You look stunning, are you looking forward to the film?"I stumbled over my words carelessly.Her face turned into a sweet grin as she noticed my flustered red cheeks beaming back at her."Thank-you, it sounds like a lovely film, I didn't get a chance to see the trailers but I hear it's got romance, grit and is heavily based on a true story.My name is Samantha, nice to meet you!".Her words permeated through me.I felt something click between us and I decided perhaps we could sit together.Samantha agreed to sit with me and we were shown to our preferred seating area.We found our seats, a breath taking view.Royal velvet red curtains swept the sides of the theatre.Golden angelic statues were upon us from the corners with smiling warm faces."So are you here alone?"Samantha spoke softly."Yes, I'm here by myself, how about you?She nodded, which I took as an acknowledgement that she was here alone.Her hand took mine, I looked over to her and a tear was falling over her cheek."What's wrong?"I whispered, gripping her hand trying to comfort her."I don't know why I'm here, but you seem really nice and I haven't felt connected to someone so quickly like I have with you.I don't even know you but I want to kiss you".Samantha's breathing increased, her eyes widening as she looked back to me questioning everything.The words I wanted to say wouldn't let themselves out.I kissed her hand and moved her closer into me.Almost silently I said "Samantha, if after this movie you want to start something, leave by my side and we'll go on an adventure"

The film started.Cheers erupted around us as we learned the life of Daniel Trine.Daniel was the adopted kid that moved from adoption center to adoption center.Carrying his little napsack where he went, he could never find a set of parents.At the age of 18 he was released onto the street.I noticed that he started to look a little familiar.Daniel was discharged from the army after damaging his left arm.His girlfriend cheated on him whilst he served his country and hopped to the other side of the world.Being an honourable man, he sent every cent he could afford back to his family.Unfortunately for him, finding a job throughout economic downturn in New York was rough.He got kicked out of his apartment because of late rent payments.Sleeping rough he starts begging for cash.He hangs out on wall street and makes his way through the surrounding area.He watches what people are doing on the stock market day in and day out.During his time on the streets he makes friends with certain people who charitably help him.He still helps out by sending charities money but years of sleeping rough and abusing pain medication and other drugs has left him with addiction and pain and suffering.Being honourable he does not wish to waste the gifts he has been given.When people offer him money he spends it the best way he knows how, charity for others, some goes to medication and the rest feeds him poorly.Daniel decides on a cold morning to try his luck with some extra cash.He gets double the return on investment and keeps going.Continuously winning, he begins to catch the interest of local business men and women.They offer him friendship and a guaranteed incredible wage if he can turn a profit.He accepts.Within the next month or two he is money mad, he's making a mint, he's worked his way into upper class.His friends are all upper class and only care about money.He starts working on hard drugs like cocaine.He starts gambling and making a ton more money.He forgets all of his friends, the ones that looked after him until one morning he walks out of the casino drunk, he's stumbling home.Cocaine fulled and in need of sleep.It's at this point I have to recoil in horror.The man on the screen, that was me.I'm younger, I'm horrible.This is my story...He sees a young girl there, no older than he was when he started begging.He shouts in her face get off the streets stupid girl, sort your life out, scum.He turns and see's her crying.He asks her what's wrong, she says she is looking for someone.The girl, down on her luck and starving cries out to him.She stands up her lavender eyes piercing through him.Tears are falling from my face and I realise.I turned towards Samantha, the women I fell in love with, the woman I've always loved.I grew old and died with her.I kissed her lips softly.Her grin returned and she whispered "I love you Daniel".
