And I recall the smells in the park,

How I used to run, and fetch, and bark.You'd always bring with you a ball,

But I got distracted, and lost them all.And I recall the snausages,

and now I'm drooling, because snausages.You'd ask me to sit or do a trick,

and always gave me two, for being lightning quick.I recall when you'd get scared, 

the nights were dark, you had nightmares.So I'd crawl up on your bed,

we weren't allowed, but you'd pet my head.And I recall when I'd get scared,

when cars backfired, or thunder blared.But it was always ok you said,

you'd call me over, to pet my head.And I recall when you'd get sick,

and how I'd try, to heal you with licks.Mom would take me from your room at that,

but you'd always call, me back for pats.And I recall when when grandpa died,

I could tell you'd need me, always at your side.I licked away your salty tears,

we sat together, you scratched me ears.And I recall just so much more,

like how you'd laugh, when I would snore.Or how you always made me feel,

so like family, it was surreal.And I know that you too recall,

memories together, you'll have them all.So when you miss me go ahead and think,

perhaps of that time, when I ate pen ink.Or how I filled you up with glee,

at least I hope I did, you sure did me.Instead of how I got so sick,

how I had to leave, just much too quick.
