Quick note to OP, I think you meant to say Apostles.Jesus had many more disciples than 12._____

**The Book of Rad**

Rad 2:1

On the fifth week day a bachelor party took place at Cana in Galilee.Jesus had been invited, along with a plus one.So Jesus brought his apostle Chad as his plus one, and Brad as Chad's plus one's plus one.Chad scoped out the joint before turning to Jesus and saying to him, "JC, my man.There is nowhere near enough wine here for all of these people to get plastered.""So be it," Jesus replied."Bring me the barrels of wine."Brad and Chad began to lift the barrels before turning to Jesus once more."JC, could you just come over here?It would be a lot easier.These are heavier than a man-eating whale!"So Jesus approached the barrels of wine and blessed them.Chad filled a chalice from the barrel and took a sip.Chad sung with joy, "Hard liquor!The Lord has blessed us with hard liquor!"And so all the guests got turnt higher than the heavens.
