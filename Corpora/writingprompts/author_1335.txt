It seems like every time I ran into Amelia Fowler she was in the middle of some kind of catastrophe.Just last week she had a flat tire at two in the morning twenty miles out of town, with no one around but cows and cotton.A month ago it was in line at the grocery store with a shopping cart the contents of which almost brought a tear to my eye and a check card that couldn't cover even that.I helped.I couldn't not help.It didn't matter that we'd been done for eight months, or dated for three weeks.She was a person, and she needed someone, and I was there.That's what you do in small towns like this.I guess that's why we started dating in the first place.The "in need" part, not the small town part, although that was probably some of it, too.When you are fifteen and everything feels like it's the most important thing in the world, that is enough.Sitting in the back of my old truck, I promised her the world and she blushed and was beautiful and we loved each other.But the Fowler clan was a train wreck.Amelia was abused, neglected, addicted, and already working on her criminal record then, at sixteen.I should never have gotten involved with her.The whole thing blew up less than a month after it started.Eventually I realized she must have been getting herself in trouble around me on purpose, like as a way to control me or something.That was the kind of thing a girl like her would do.It's not her fault; not exactly, but I wasn't going to be manipulated like that.I started distancing myself from Amelia.Still I would run into her from time to time, and always she was in the middle of some crisis.At first I was kind with her.Then I was patient.I became firm.I became Angry.Finally I became cruel.I said mean things to her about who she was and how she lived.I still helped.You have to help people.But I wish I hadn't said those things.As time went on, I ran into Amelia less and less often.I heard from a friend of a friend that she had gotten herself knocked up by and then married to some office worker type.Unexciting, but stable.That sounded like a good thing, and I was happy for her.Gradually, I began to forget about Amelia Fowler....It was really unusual for the bastards to take us anywhere.They mostly liked to keep us locked up in our shitty little rooms unless it was time for medicine or "food."Today they'd gotten it into their piss-for-brains heads to drag us old geezers out to the park for some "Eeh-an-richmint," as that lousy dick of a head nurse pronounces it.Some of the geezers who have decent families are going to have a nice afternoon frolicking in the Goddamned daisy or whatever.My wife is dead.Fuck, most of my kids are dead.They don't tell you about that shit when you're growing up!Life kills people!And the ones who are still alive aren't worth two shits.So I was looking forward to sitting alone on a hot hillside in the middle of June like the subject of some kind of shitty dollar store painting 'cause it'd make dick feel like he was doing his job.Anyway, we'd been out there for a little over forty-five minutes, and my ass was killing me.That piece-of-crap lawn chair must have been made in Nicaragua.Why can't shit come from China anymore like in the good old days?When all of a sudden this old biddy, who was hobbling along on her walker, keels over right there on my spot of grass; pissed off the pigeons.I was trying to enjoy the view of the lake and here's this bitch, flopping on the ground clutching at her back pissing and moaning.So I haul my aching, wrinkly old ass out of my piece-of-shit Nicaraguan chair and kneel down in the stifling heat of that mosquito-infested June morning to see what's wrong.I roll her over and damned if it isn't Amelia Fowler."My God it's you!"She exhaled."I'm having a heart attack.It's my fourth one.I know what they feel like, and I know I'm not going to make it.""Amelia what is this shit?You think I can't tell a fake heart attack?I did fifteen years with-" I started, but she cut me off."Shut up, Frank.I don't know where I would have wound up if I'd have never met you, but I can guess.I'm dying an old woman with a full life instead of a young girl with stupid ideas 'cause of you.I needed to tell you that.I promise I won't need you again."I yelled for dick, and he stumbled over and bumbled though ECPR, but Amelia was right.She was done for.That was the last time I saw Amelia Fowler.
