I'd been waiting for almost 40 years.Or was it 4?Time runs differently here, wherever here is, and the lineup to the afterlife was... long to say the least.Over all that time, it's common to become friends with the others waiting for their turn at judgment.You hear all kinds of stories, regrets, life experiences... And not all of them are wholesome, let me tell you.Three people ahead of me was a woman who, after a couple years in line, confessed to murdering three people.She wondered who was going to represent the one that died by her actions.I don't really know why she's even here.Does a person like that really need judgment to know where to send her?Another guy also murdered people, but went much further after they were killed.I don't really want to get into his story.But despite what these people did, here in purgatory none of that really matters.We're all just people after everything, and commonalities bring people together.And we were all there together, stuck in line.And if there's anything that can bring people together, complaining about how slow a line is moving is one of them.Most people, it seemed, had an idea of who was going to  be there to judge them.Some people had a very strong inclination of who they might be.Others had a vast pool of names they ran through in their head, trying to figure out who was most likely to be behind the door.Me, on the other hand...I had no clue who was going to judge me.For the life of me - or lack thereof - I couldn't think of anyone I had helped save, died by my actions, been cruelest to or been nicest to.I don't know how all these people had such strong ideas of who could be behind that door.But after what felt like 40 years, I was up next.The large, blinding light above the door changed from deep red to neon green and I opened the mysterious door from which no one ever exited.Inside was an empty room, save for a single table in the middle, four chairs sitting opposite one.There was no other door.Just the one I came in from, and yet as I looked behind me, the door vanished.I was just stuck in an empty room, with no way out.Something must've been wrong.I sat down and decided to wait.I waited,  
and waited  
and waited.And not once, in the \[what felt like\] 10 years I was in that room, did anyone show up.It was just me.And after all that time of sitting there, waiting, unsure of what to do, I made the connection.There was no one else.No one could judge me.In the end, my choices are my own.And I am the one who has to accept and live with the consequences.It didn't matter if I made the choice to be cruel to someone when I was 10, or treat the prettiest girl in school like a princess when I was 17, and it didn't matter that a choice I made resulted in another's death, as horrible as it makes me feel, and it didn't matter that a choice I made saved another's life, though I'm sure they're very grateful.The only person that can judge me is myself.And that's the point.For the afterlife can't be anything until you teach yourself action, consequence, responsibility, respect for life, to love others, and to love yourself, and uphold all of those practices and morals with kindness and empathy for everyone and everything around you.Because all of us are in life together, and only when we treat ourselves, others, and the planet with love can we find our heaven.And after everything, life on Earth might just be the heaven we wait all our lives for.It's up to each and every one of us to find it for ourselves.And as soon as the door behind be vanished, another appeared on the other side of the room.I stood up and walked toward it.I hesitated, very confused about this entire process, but undeniably curious about what was behind that door.Upon opening it, a bright, white light enveloped me and everything around me.Then suddenly everything became wet, and cold, and then warm and comforting.But heavy, like there was an unseen force all around me, pressing inwards.And I emerged from a small, orange sac.I looked around and saw what looked like sand.But they were huge pieces of sand.Not like any sand I had seen, but sand nonetheless.Somehow I just knew.And slowly, I realized I was a...  


A fish?None of it made sense.And yet here I am.And the last thoughts I had before accepting my new life and venturing out into the open ocean for my first bites of fish food was of the line, and the room, the humans waiting for their turn, and if there was such a thing for fish, and if it even mattered.
