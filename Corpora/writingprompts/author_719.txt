This is it the end is near... Can you do it??Do what?I muttered as the man who is shrouded in shadow hands me a curved object wrapped in silk .He looks at me as if he is judging me from head to toe I can feel his eyes analyze me inch my inch.For a full minute I stand their quietly till he States in a harsher voice , " you must kill those who you love first, the world won't understand but you will once your soul is tied to the artifact".I begin to realize a sense a regret in the man's voice like he has felt this power and rejected it's responsibility.He begins to walk away and only yells back, " kill to save boy you'll get good at just don't get caught " .Confused and mortified I go home instantly.Who the hell did I just talk too and why me ?I look in my backpack and pull out the object given to me.I unwrap the black silk that hugged the object tight only to unveil a beautiful dagger of sorts.The handle was pure gold with a gem that sat at the very end that shined intense blue.The blade was clean and with inscriptions running up and down the blade on both sides.As I picked the dagger up and held it for the first time I felt strange.All of sudden the world around me changes.I see it in the future earths final days are soon and the dagger is the key to survival.Suddenly I see the importance of the mysterious man's words "kill to save".I get up and instantly go to my parents."How do I tell them that I have to kill them so they can wake up saved?"I open their door to see both of them lying in bed but awake each doing their own thing."Come in dear" my mom says in her gentle voice."What do have there, my dad says as he points to the dagger.I begin to feel it my heart raising sweat drips Down my brow.Do I tell them or just do it and explain later?How can I kill 7 billion people ?How do I have the world if I have to watch the ones I love die first ?My mind is raising.My parents watch me with curiousity and fear.My dad gets up and moves towards me slowly."Son what's going talk to me" he says in a concerned voice.He comes within 3 feet of me and is waiting for a response.I look up from the ground with tears down my face, " dad I ..I.Love you both of you" he looks at and begins to State," I love yo...." I cut his throat with a swift motion.My mother screams and begins to run as I crumple to my knees and watch my fathers last gurgled breath leave his body.I cry and tell him that I will see him soon.I get up and look for my mother, " mom I can explain I yelled please just listen " my mother is hiding in a closet just down the hall I find her clutching her phone as she looks at and says " I called the police why are you doing this?"Her voice is Shakey as tears streak down her face.I look at and say I did it because the dagger told me too.I can't take my mother's life I look at her," I'm sorry and I love you Mom take the dagger after I'm gone and save yourself" my mom looks confused as I take the dagger and cut my throat.....
