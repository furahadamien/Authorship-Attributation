Manw Industrial Corporations technically shut down all operations by 9:00 PM each day, but only the corporates payed any notice.The parking lot vacated of all but a few cars, Doctor Robert LaFollette savored a cigarette in the walkway of the HR building.The harsh, incandescent light buzzed overhead, light beating down on his shoulders with a weightless fury, turning his gray hair snow white, accentuating the lines on his face.He stared at his reflection in the windowpane.The lights inside were all switched off, the stark contrast painting his image deep into the glass.His eyes hammered him like rivets, soft blue turning oily black in the tint of the darkened windowpane.Smoke curled form his cigarette, and as he watched it caress his face in the window he swore he could feel it lick across his cheeks.It felt good on his rosacea.The folliculitis had set in and throughout the day he struggled to keep from scratching his face raw.There was no sign of it in the reflection.His skin was dark, covered in shadow, and in his stillness there was a lifelessness to it.Sunken, sallow, gray and wrinkled.Those damn black beady eyes poured into his, like oil spilling into the sea.I dont suppose I feel too clever anymore, Doctor LaFollette. his reflection crooned.Robert stumbled backward, catching himself on the handicap guide rail, feet slipping on the steps.He cursed and dropped to the ground.The metal guide rail had dug sharply into the outside of his hand, and he cradled it to his chest while lines of pain shot up and down his palm.His reflection stepped over the windowsill and, bracing one arm around his back, hoisted him back to his feet and batted the dust from his coat.The doctor nodded, sighing.Thanks.

The doppelganger stepped to the middle of the entryway.Standing directly under the light, it flared out around him, slowing down it arced to avoid touching him, leaving him painted only in the soft, shadowy glow that he emanated.He ground the smoldering cigarette into the ground with his boot, expression humored he spread his arms out wide.Is this some sort of mockery, good doctor?I thought it above you.

The doctor sighed.It was about time He made an appearance.Funny, Robert muttered, fishing around for the rest of his packet in his inside coat pocket.Extracting it, he removed another cigarette and put it to his lips.Give me a light, would you, Lucifer.

The devil snapped his fingers, and a small flame burst forth from his fingernail.He held out his hand and Robert leaned down and dipped the cigarette into the fire.Straightening he pulled it from his mouth, blowing a long train of smoke and leaning back against the wall.Lucifer watched him a moment.Robert found it strange to watch his own features contort independently of his will.The expressions were both intimately familiar, and completely alien.Every shape, every alignment was correct, but it was like watching a mortician set the face of a corpse before a funeral.The expressions didnt quite seem real, they didnt quite seem alive.And they werent.Folding his arms, the devil leaned against the wall beside him.Color me impressed, doctor.I find it difficult to even rally any anger.I am simply in awe. He glanced about him, and then leaned in conspiratorially.Robert was sure he would have seen those eyes twinkling if there were anything living behind them.You have made yourself a god.

The devil barked a short laugh.Then a longer one.He nudged the doctors ribs.The odd juxtaposition of his face aged up, and his movements aged down almost made him sick.Lucifer fell back against the wall, roughly, bouncing slightly as he collided.His face was in an ugly twist, battling between furor and delight.He wiggled his finger at the doctor, pursing his lips.You dirty ol rascal, you! Then he laughed again, and shook Roberts shoulder.The doctor stared blankly across the narrow entryway, mouth hanging open slightly.His mouth felt dry.So, what are you going to do next, doctor? queried Lucifer.Youre practically a brand new god.Its tradition to go on a tear.Montecarlo?The Maldives?Bora Bora?All the money in the world, and all the time to spend it. The devil winked.You think you might bring me along part of the way? Then he cackled.Robert nodded his head absentmindedly.His cheeks had begun to itch again, and he brought his hand to them and scratched.He felt tired.He should have been in bed by now.Much longer and hed have to wake up three times before morning to throw a piss.Footsteps clacked across the parking lot, followed by a pair of voices in conversation, and two chemical engineers from the environmental sciences department strode between the sparsely packed cars.They called out to Robert, bidding him a good night.If either of them saw his hellish doppelganger, they didnt comment.So, whatll it be? 

Robert LaFollette took the cigarette from his mouth and stood up from the wall.Taking his cane from the bannister, he thrust it against the concrete walkway and pushed his spine straight, turning to face the devil, the ombratic face still smiling at him.It will be nothing.

The devil furrowed his eyebrows, turning away from him with a puzzled expression and quickly looking back.That seems a bit of a waste of your victory, dont you think, Doctor?

There was a crash.Its not my victory, damn you.

The devils expression went blank.Robert stood breathing heavily, the rest of his face reddening to match his cheeks.Calmly, Lucifer turned his head, eyes resting on the smashed window into which Robert had thrust his cane.The old doctor closed his eyes and took a deep breath, and in that moment felt the smothering weight of death, and the ambient heat of the thousand fires of hell, and he felt it stop just before him, bending around him like the light bent around the devil.His eyes opened, and chips of deep blue stuck into oily black with the cold, deliberate fury of a miter.He stood tall, the rippling strength of all his years come unto him, and in that moment he stood before death his defier, his conqueror.Brightest flame, though, burns most quickly, and Robert deflated, and felt his age wash over him like an algal bloom.Furious tsunamis dried into little more than swampwater, and they regarded the devil in emptiness.Would you call it a victory to achieve apotheosis at the expense of your humanity?Is it victorious to spend week after week, year after year, all day and all night buried deep within a clandestine laboratory?Your wife left alone to wonder after you, sitting tall at the dinner table each night, dolled up, a three course meal a table, waiting until well past midnight hoping that maybe this is the day you come home.

His voice wavered.Would you call it a victory to come home that one night and find her gone.Your friends and family unwilling to speak to you, or tell you where she went.

The two stood there in silence, the devils face unreadable.No tears fell from the doctors eyes, nor did they swim or shake.He had done all his crying decades ago.Forty five years ago I called to you, and you bid my call.Forty five years ago you offered me limitless resource in exchange for my soul, that at the end of my life regardless of the cleanness of my soul I would be yours for all of time.

Forty five years ago I knew I could beat you.I would escape death and escape your realm of the damned, and Peggy and I would ride off into the sunset, walk the the Appalachian, take a drink from the Nile River, lay a track on the Golan Heights.

Forty five years ago I could run the mile in under six minutes.Forty five years ago I could climb the Devils Thumb.Forty five years ago I didnt have arthritis in my knees, or cancer in my lungs, or dementia in my brain.

The old doctor swapped his cane from left to right, and shuffled away from the smashed window towards the short flight of steps leading away from the entryway.The devil watched him go, face still unreadable, and shifted against the wall so that he remained facing him.Robert stopped before the top step, turning back a quarter-circle.A young man may have eternal youth, but an old man has eternal caducity.He spit out the cigarette, it landed on the concrete between them.Robert LaFollette nodded to the devil, Stamp that out for me, would you. And then he left.The devil stood there in the dark, his surroundings bathed in light.Crickets chirruped from the grass across the lot, and the faint breath of highway traffic floated across the relative softness of the night.He stepped forward.The cigarette lay between his boots.Scratching the to along the ground, he brought his right leg in, and stomped the ball of his foot down on the roll, grinding it into nothing.He looked out from the entryway, silhouetted in the harsh lamplight.Ill see you around, Doctor LaFollette,  and then he was gone.The lamp winked out.
