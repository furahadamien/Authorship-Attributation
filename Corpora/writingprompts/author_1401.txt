They can see me.I made it so.They screamed, ran away from me, hid in the ruins of their civilization.I never liked hiding, it was a necessary evil that I no longer needed, so I remained there and waited for them to come back.Their leader stood in front of me.Middle aged woman, an air of suburbia surrounds her.She is going to face me like I'm somebody's manager.Haven't I seen hundreds like her?"Who are you supposed to be?"she says, as she points at me."Your ally" I take off my hood, she takes a step back "we seem to have a common interest: you don't want to die.I don't want your kind to die"

My words took her aback, but she stood firm "Well, if you didn't want us to die, why on earth did you turn the world into...? her kids were watching from a window "doo doo?!"I shrugged "I didn't do-do that" I hear snickering from afar "The mechanisms of society, of reality, are far too complicated, not even I can understand it.But I do have much to lose if your kind is lost.That's why I am offering my services"

I extend my hand.She stares at it, then at me."A deal with Death?"she asks as she grins."Not anymore" I say " A deal with Life"
