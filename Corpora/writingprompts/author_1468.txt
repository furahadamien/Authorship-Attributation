Max sat underneath the bright neon sign, his hands roaming the confines of his black trench coat for his lighter.The rain was pressing hard tonight, a cold breeze accompanying the pour.It was *perfect* for a cigarette.He surveyed the back alley he was standing in, looking for any stragglers sharing the space.Lighting one up was always awkward in the presence of others, he wanted to avoid that.And the incessant questioning.He took his first drag for the night, smoke slipping between his lips and into the air above.It was just him and the cig, the last in the pack.But then he heard a noise.The neon billboard was shifting and changing.A blue and red hand judgmentally pointed towards Max; he knew what was coming.''Of the 10 million people living on Earth and 4 million living on Mars, you're the only one consuming poisonous tobacco extracts!is your life so broken that you need to slowly edge yourself towards certain disease and death?''He yelled some obscenities and left the scene.
