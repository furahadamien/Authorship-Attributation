The Curator of Eons led Melissa down the hall.It was as long as she could see, and the man beside her gave a sense of comfort and awe.She was reasonably sure why she was here-- she remembered clearly hitting the ground and feeling her body give up.But she didn't know why she was *here*, in this vast, open-sky library.The walls, floors, and ceilings were lined with books of every aged color.Short, carpeted stairways led to endless little nooks, where men, women, and children sat with each other and read.Gravity only seemed to work where people wanted it to work.Both she and the Curator ascended great stairways and turned corners and passed through oaken doors on their way to... somewhere."We're on our way to your nook of the universe," the Curator said, in a deep, satisfying voice.Melissa didn't think she actually asked the question.Maybe she did.Maybe the Curator just sensed it.He half-turned to her."In here, you are your mind.What's to stop me from reading you?"Melissa didn't argue, and continued to follow.The Curator's legs moved as if he walked, but his step was oddly motionless, like a dream.After passing untold numbers of books and peoples, at last they found an empty bench.Only it wasn't quite empty.A single worn-out red paperback laid on the firm, tan cushion in front of her."This is the book of your life," the Curator began."Paperback?Why not hardcover?"The Curator of Eons chuckled with a genuine twist, and replied "Paperback, hardcover, newspaper, tablet, memo... What you see in front of you is your preferred form of accepting information.If you really wanted a hardcover volume, it would have presented itself that way."Melissa disagreed that she preferred paperback, but let the issue drop.There was no sense in arguing.The Curator gestured around her."Every book within your reach contains every possible outcome of your life, from your earliest memory to your last," The Curator explained.Something about how the Curator said "last" made Melissa feel uncomfortable."Read to your heart's content, and learn all your possible paths."The Curator turned to walk away."Why?"Melissa asked.The Curator of Eons halted."What if I don't want to read?"she added before the Curator could speak up."Then... " the Curator paused, choosing words carefully."What comes next for you might not be ...optimal.Read, and learn your possible fates.When you are done, we will move on."Melissa was left alone with the red paperback in her hand.She was curious, sure.A large part of her wanted to sit and spend eons going over what could have been.It's not like she was in a rush to get anywhere; a "waste of time" was literally not a thing anymore.She stared at the plain, wordless cover.The book felt warm to the touch, like a friendly embrace.The spine was already suffering from intense creasing and scuffing.The top corner curled backwards, and she could see the hint of the faintest yellow on the first page.Her sense memory filled her nose with the scent of a hundred-year-old bookstore, even though she could actually smell nothing.Her hand went to open it, and a feeling of soothing kinship washed over her, like she were sitting down with an old friend.Wait.She couldn't actually smell anything.The book *felt* warm in her mind, but when she took her fingertips and ran them across the red, she could feel no texture or pressure.She looked at all the books around her, and ran her hands across them, too.Same thing."None of this is real," she muttered.She admitted to herself that maybe that's just the way things were, here in the afterworld.But that wasn't a satisfactory answer.She put her worn, red paperback down and started back the way she came.She called out to the first person she saw, an old man with a beard wild enough to give her grandpa a run for his money.If he heard her calls, he ignored them as he turned pages.Melissa moved on to a young woman not far from him.She, too, ignored her calls.So did the family beside her, and the young man above them.Melissa tried climbing the bookshelves to get to them, but they were always further away than they appeared.Melissa grumbled and sat cross-legged on an oaken table.She thought about her last moments.She hit the ground.She remembered feeling where bones had broken and ended up in the wrong places.She had a vague, blurry memory of seeing bright lights and blue gloves.Lying cold on metal.Hearing cries and sobs.She did not remember any pain.None at all.Melissa leaped back down to the hall at the bottom of a great chasm of pages.She landed on her feet this time.The great hall led down a staircase.She walked carefully, then sprinted down steps three or four at a time.She never lost her balance, and when she stopped, she was not out of breath.Was she even breathing?She stopped and tried, and her lungs seemed to work, but she couldn't feel any air enter.At the bottom of the staircase was a long hall, with fewer books.She passed by them all until she reached a plain metal door.She took hold of the knob."I really wish you would read, Melissa," The Curator's voice said to her from a few paces behind.Melissa turned with her hand still on the knob."I'm not real, am I?"Melissa said with a blunt edge."You're as real as you want yourself to be," The Curator said."Bullshit," Melissa said."I want to feel things.I want to talk to people.But something else is going on here, and I want to know what."The Curator of Eons paused, considering."So you do not wish to read?You do not wish to learn all your possible outcomes?""What would be the point?"Melissa said."I don't regret leaping out of that plane.I don't regret anything.I had the time of my life."The Curator nodded in a way that made her unsure she had made the right decision.In a flash, she wondered if *that* decision would end up in the book."That is...disappointing."the Curator said.For a few hesitant moments, Melissa watched as his hand raised.She felt like she had been scolded, and she prepared herself to stand firm.He gestured to the metal door."Then it's time you turned that knob.Farewell."The Curator turned away from her and disappeared into the horizon of tomes, without sound, without breath, without emotion.Without heart.Melissa looked at the door again.It felt older, more ancient than when she first saw it.It was also taller and heavier.She twisted her wrist and pulled it open with a fluid motion.And then there was black.The room she stood in wasn't all black, though.There were stars in the distance, but she wasn't looking at the real night's sky.All the stars were wrong.No Big Dipper, no Orion's Belt, nothing familiar at all.There was a sleek metal table with two chairs in front of her.She sat in one and examined the room further.There were no corners that she could find, not even along the edges of the table and chairs.She still couldn't feel any pressure, or smell anything, or breathe anything.She kept her eye on the stars for a while, and maybe they were moving.But if they did, they moved so slowly that she couldn't be sure they just weren't shimmering back and forth like little white fireflies.A door in front of her opened.A woman with red hair walked in.Unlike the Curator, she had a stride that was more human-like.Her smile certainly looked real enough."Welcome," the woman said."I am Caiera.Are you ready to choose?"
