"Shield your face, Jimothy, that's the POLLUTER MANG."The angry woman knelt down and pulled her son's flapback hat over his face.He squealed in protest.I'll never get used to the slang of these times, where even a milk toast mother of two would call a man a 'mang'.But there are a lot of things about 2040 that I'll never be able to get used to... the main one being that I can't pump durries without being completely demonized.I don't even smoke outdoors.I smoke in a specially designed chamber that converts the cigarette fumes into useful carbolic gas that I use to grow crops in my greenhouse, which I grow only to feed orphaned children from the Great, Great War of 2035.I swear, the name Joseph Gordon-Levitt used to command some level of respect, but nowadays I'm a social reject, even labelled a radical, just because of my one lingering habit.It's just not fair.Jimothy and his mother disappeared down the lane, and I rounded the corner and punched in the code for my front gate.My old place used to have a fingerprint scanner, but negative press has relegated me to a far more humble abode.I ascended the stairs to my unit, latched the front door and sank into my pockmarked couch."TV On", I mumbled and the box lit up; I was greeted with Jimmy Fallon weeping bitterly, a very common image these days.Cut to commercial break, and I sat up straight in preparation for an adventure to the fridge for a beer.I was stopped short, however, by the snarky tone of the advertisement."Isn't it just so cool, going round and killing people slowly and indiscriminately?Yeah, isn't it primo-wacka (common future slang) to infect the lungs of your children, and guarantee birth defects in generations to come?Well, JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT SURE AS FUCK THINKS SO!"And the very next frame was hi-defrinition 3D footage of Jimothy's mother pulling the hat over his face, from moments ago.The footage had been edited so that I flipped off the young mother and blew a large plume of comical black smoke at her.The next scene was an interview with her, holding her child."He's killing us!He's killing usssss!"she wailed, as Jimothy stared at her confusedly.The madness continued."The next time you consider sparking one up, Mr Gordon-Levitt, just remember, everyone on the planet hates you."Not the orphans that I feed, I thought smugly, and changed the channel.
