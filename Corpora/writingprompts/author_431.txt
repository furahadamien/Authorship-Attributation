They said they wanted peace.They said they wanted to avoid a future where humanity wiped itself out.They said a lot of things.And then they said no more.For fifty years we waited.We followed the treaty down to the letter, even refusing to contact our northern and southern neighbors.For fifty years we waited, as they spat on their supposed good intentions.We waited as peace broke down.We waited as war broke out.There's a slight poetic justice to learning that the ones who were afraid of us, the ones responsible for this self imposed exile, died in a hellfire of their own making.They thought that we were the biggest threat.They thought we were the cancer spreading throughout the world, destroying everything it touched.They were wrong.We were simply a deterrent.A force of nature that none dared to cross.And with us out of the way, with nothing to be afraid of, the world tore itself apart.We came out of our exile prepared to fight.We expected an army of nations, prepared to end us, once and for all.But what we found instead was the very world itself, wrapped up in a wintery bow, waiting for us to take it.
