I wait, alone in a vacuum of space.Theres nothing to stimulate my senses and all I have are my thoughts.Except now, unlike in life, I can remember everything.Every single moment is crystal clear, void of clouded perceptions and judgement.Reality is seen as it truly was.There is no ego here, just... reality.First I scroll through my memories quickly, as if time matters trying to find whove I hurt the most, whove Ive been the most cruel to.So many heartaches, so many crass words and snide remarks.I never meant to hurt them that way.Why was I like that?Then, as I think Ive found the one I hurt the most I start to scroll through and find the one I was kindest too, the one I think I helped the most.After finding that one, I smile and ask myself, why couldnt I have been that kind to all?At least I had some good in me.Then I find the one who I had saved, and that didnt take long.Such a feat doesnt happen often.Again, I smile and Im proud I helped someone out of a precarious situation that life has dealt them.Finally, as I sit alone in the void, I find the one that died because of me.I see the moment that their life slips and their breathing ceased.I can see the moment that death has triumphed and I helped.I feel ashamed.Even not knowing that I had done it, I did in fact cause it.As I ponder these moments I know Ill never be admitted to heaven.How can someone who has hurt so many be allowed to enter into the gate of Heaven?I am destined for hell.My wait ends, and a door thats wasnt there  moments before opens, and a darkened figure stands between me and a lot room.I can see 4 figures sitting in chairs forming a small C with one empty chair, for me to sit.I walk into the room knowing with whom Im going to have to face.I feel a mixture of emotions, knowing my fate I wonder why we even bother with the formalities.As I approach the figures in the well lit room I still cant see their faces.As soon as I sit down their features become visible.Each one of the figures is me, from a different period in my life.I was the cruelest to myself, never forgiving myself for such rage and always beating myself up.I was kindest to myself, when it got dark, I told myself I could do it, to get back up one more time and face the world.I saved myself, pulling myself up out of the utter darkness as the pain swallowed my soul.Finally, I lost the battle, and killed myself, because the kindness and the saving werent enough.
