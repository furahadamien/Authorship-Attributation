I tend to write in first person, and my great-grandfather trained German Shepherds for the Danish police force before the advent of World-War-II, so this really isn't about your dog:

> There are no sheep quite like German sheep.> Don't get me wrong, a leg of lamb is a leg of lamb, but there's something about nipping at the hindquarters of a Friesian that get's my blood up.My dad got me into the habit I suppose.And his dad before him.German upon German upon German biting the flanks of all the sheep we can find going back as long as anybody can remember, we're bound to build up a taste for it.Some call us inbreeds; we call it heritage.> I will always be proud of how I came to be.You can see it in my stance.If you couldn't see it the sheep couldn't see it either, and the sheep need to see it.The shepherd needs the sheep to see it, so I need the sheep to see it, so I need the shepherd to see it.> There are no shepherds quite like German shepherds.
