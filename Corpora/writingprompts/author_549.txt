And when I went downstairs to make my morning coffee i didn't look twice at my mug, I'm always number one so why would it be different today?My wife comes down and points out I have a new mug, "no this is the same mug I use everyday.""Then why does it say #666?"Confused and worried I look at my mug, in a panic I shout to my children to come down."Did you guys do this as a joke?!?"They seemed as confused as I did.I decided to leave it alone for now and went outside to water the lawn.I saw jimmy out there doing the same, he seemed distraught."Jimmy what's wrong?""One of the kids must be playing a joke on me, they changed the number on my mug, but won't be honest about it.""Yeah, what number did they put?My kids did the same to mine.""65,381.What about you?""I got 666.""Well that's not ominous at all."Finished with the yard I had to go to work, driving there all I could think was maybe it's because I'm a beast.
