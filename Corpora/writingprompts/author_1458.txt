"That thing will give you cancer," the man in the advertisement said with a smug grin.Jake moved on.He was use to it at this point.Anyways Nothing could top that time, nearly two years ago, when the President herself had mentioned him in the state of the union, highlighting the near perfect success of the anti-smoking campaign.Jake had gotten use to it by now.It actually had some benefits.On the one hand, he was a pariah of sorts.People looked on at him with disgust.They asked him if he knew how bad the habit was, as if the increasingly personal advertisements or the constant protestors outside his house had not already given him that impression.But he didn't really care.He had grown use to the life of an outcast, but it wasn't all bad.He had no problem finding women to date, though usually that only lasted for as long as they were trying to piss off their parents, but he didn't care.There was always another.It even helped him make friends in some circles.Sure they would never smoke with him, but they respected him.He'd get invited to conferences and even spoke at the UN once, a symbol of the freedom he represented in his country.They would never ban smoking, take away his freedom, but so to were they free to shame him.He didn't mind though.And in a way, even as they shamed him, they appreciated him.He Was a lone holdout in a world that became less familiar with each passing moment.He was an ever present, if stinky, reminder of when things didn't move so fast, when people didn't know so much, when mistakes were tolerated.Now everything changed so much.Technology has transformed the world in to a sort of utopia, and though life was undeniably better, it was less interesting, less challenging.Change became the norm.Jake was a reminder of an older time when people were more individualistic, more interesting.And so while they urged him to conform, he was confident they were happy that he didn't."No one wants to marry a smoker Jake," the billboard spoke to him."Yeah well a smoker doesn't want to marry," he shot back.An annoying laugh shot out from behind him.He turned around to see a young man, no more than twenty, smiling at him."They said you were funny," the man quipped."You'd have to have a sense of humor to carry on with those Death sticks."Jake was use to this.They'd make a comment and then usually move on, satisfied that they had said their peace.But this young man lingered.Jake could tell he wanted to leave, his mind was ordering his feet to move but his feet refused to yield.Something held him there.Jake reached into his pocket and pulled out one of the cigarettes he had rolled earlier that day.He offered it to the man, something he had done a thousand times before, a small and expected act of defiance, typical of these exchanges.But this time was different.He saw it in the mans eyes as soon as he offered it.That look of excitement that seemed not to exist anymore in this world of ease and plenty."Sure," The man said and extended his hand.
