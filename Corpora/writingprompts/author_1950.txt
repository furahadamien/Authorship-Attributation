"What the hell!?"You bend down to pick up the remains of your wallet.Flipping it open, you notice scraps of metal and loose wire in your wallet."A tracker," he says."Why in God's name would anyone be tracking me?""They're tracking all of us," he says, pulling out his own wallet to show the remains of his tracker."Who?""Women.They started an underground establishment, calling themselves the Women's Tracking Foundation of America, or, as I like to call it, WTF America.They're taking over everything.The government.Police force.Military.You name it.And your wife--she's in it."Then, you hear sirens approaching."They saw the tracker go offline.Follow me."He climbs up a ladder in the alley leading to the roof of the building.Soon after we get to the top, the police arrive and search the alley."Women...the whole police force is all women," he says.The four women split up at an intersection in the alley.Two go to the left.And two to the right, walking along the building we are on.Then, you realize you don't know the man's name."The name's Frank," he says, as if he had read your mind.You and the man continue to follow the two women...watching them."On the count of three we jump on them," he says, when the two groups are sufficiently far away from each other."What?!?I'm not going to jump of a fucking building."He starts counting."One...Two...Three."Caught up in the moment, you jump, landing on one of the women, killing her."Take her clothes; put them on," as he does the same.You obey.Frank searches along his new outfit, finding a set of keys."Come on," he says.You follow him out of the alley and into the police cruiser.He starts it up and drives."Where are we going?""We are going to shoot up the police station.""What?""You heard me."He pulls into the police station.You both get out and head toward the armory."You know how to shoot?"he asks."A little.""Good."He hands me some big gun."Sweet," You say, having no clue how to use the gun, or even what it is called.You head out a back door and sneak around to the front of the station, following the man.As you stand in front of the main entrance, he says, "On three, I'll open the door and we'll start spraying.""One...Two...Three."The door bursts open.You charge in spraying bullets all around yourself.You lose track of Frank but just keep firing at anything that moves."Having gunned down the lobby area, you prepare to move on to another room.As you make your way to a nearby door, you look down at one of the corpses.A man."What the hell."The man said the force was being run by women.I look around and see several dead men, but no sign of Frank.You turn around with your gun lowered.Several officers are pointing their guns at you, commanding that you put the gun down.You're confused.What the hell happened?You put your gun down.The officers cuff you."There's another man," you say."What?""There was another man here--Frank!He told me to do this.I was just following him.""There's no other man," returns the officer.The officers begin to read your Miranda rights.Your heart races.Where the hell is the other man?In your fit of confusion, you pass out.You wake up in a cell alone.Soon, an officer comes by and takes you away to what appears to be an interrogation room.You sit across from a lawyer.He says he's here to help you."There was another man," you say.I met him in the alley.He killed a police officer in the alley.We each killed one.The lawyer gives you a confused look."They only found one body in that alley, but it wasn't a police officer.""What the hell."Did you imagine the whole thing?Was there no other man?No police officers in the alley?No trackers?The lawyer continues to look at you strangely."You say you saw another man?""Yes.""But there was no other man?""There was.There had to have been.I'm not crazy.II can't be.""You know, we could always argue that you're mentally unstable.If you don't want to go to prison, you could go to an asylum instead."You can't spend the rest of your life in an asylum.What would your wife think.Your wife...was she real.The man said she was involved in the tracking organization.But now you're not sure.You try to think back to your life before meeting the man.You don't remember having a wife.You don't remember a marriage...you don't remember anything, in fact.Not you job.Not your house.You don't even remember your own damn name.You ask, "what's my name?""Your name?It's Frank, of course..."
