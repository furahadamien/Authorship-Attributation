The sudden vibration jolted me out of my sleep.I'd nodded off and my phone was on my face without me realizing it.I squinted, still half asleep, at the ridiculously bright screen and read the notification."DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON"

"Really?"I muttered, annoyed, and put the phone face down on the bed.I lay in bed for a few minutes trying to go back to sleep.The neighborhood dogs were making a fuss over something.It seemed like all of them were barking and howling at each other.There was too much noise.I checked my phone again; it had just occurred to me that I didn't look to see who messaged me that nonsense at 2:37 AM.(000)-000-0000: "DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON"

Confused, I propped myself up on my elbow, rubbed my eyes and looked again.(000)-000-0000: "DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON"

It was impossible for anybody to have a number like that.Not even the automated messages from the telephone company came from that number.There wasn't even an option to reply to the message.I swiped up on my screen and unlocked the phone, and furrowed my brows at what I saw.874 new SMS messages.1,303 direct messages on Twitter.I didn't even have that many followers.Hundreds of chat bubbles on Facebook Messenger.1 snap from Team Snapchat.Ugh.Curious, I opened my text messages.Every single one of them read the same thing."It's a beautiful night tonight.Look outside."All the messages on Twitter and Facebook Messenger said the same thing as well.Team Snapchat sent me a snap of some festival or another, I didn't really look at the snap long enough to see what it was.I sat up on the bed, staring at the list of messages in bewilderment.Some of the messages were from family and close friends, but when I replied asking what this was about, I kept getting the same message back.It was a beautiful night tonight, and I should look outside.The dogs continued barking relentlessly, so I got off the bed and moved the curtain so I could see into the yard.The mango trees in our yard cast a heavy shadow, but I could vaguely make out my dog Diesel howling and barking away.His barking was different though.It was rapid and fearful, the way he'd bark at the water truck he was so terrified of when it came to make deliveries.He was also fixated on something across the road that I couldn't see from my bedroom window.Moving into the living room to get a better view only served to perplex me further.Our mango trees were mostly over the area of the yard I could see from my bedroom, but the living room faced the road and wasn't heavily shaded.I could see my neighbor and close friend across the street standing in the middle of her lawn, draped in an untied bathrobe, unflinchingly staring at something in the sky.I navigated the dark room to the window to open it and call out to her, and as soon as my hand touched the window pane, her head snapped away from the sky and turned directly toward me, causing me to almost trip backwards in surprise.She didn't move from that spot, but she was still staring in my direction, making me incredibly uneasy.Still, I regained enough composure to open the window."Che?"I called out.She kept staring blankly."Why you outside, girl?It's like minutes to 3 now.What you doing out there?""Somebody just text me to tell me to look outside, so I come outside.Come and look at this!"she shouted back.The strange thing is, nothing was unusual about how she spoke, her voice sounded just fine and her words didn't sound monotonous.But she wouldn't stop that weird staring.Perhaps it was this that made me pick up my keys, unlock my door and go out onto my lawn, all against my better judgment.Diesel was still barking frantically.In fact, as soon as he saw me step into the yard, he grew more agitated and instantly darted toward me, trying to jump on me, yelping and whining."D, what's the problem?Why you getting on like that?"I asked, as if he would answer.And then, for a second, I saw something odd in his wide open eyes as I calmed him down.Something wasn't right about the reflection I saw, but I assumed it must have been my imagination.Instinctively, I began turning my head upward and then I remembered:

(000)-000-0000: "DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON"

I pulled my phone from my pocket.The warning was still there.Che was still staring at me."Other than the text telling you to come out here, you got any other messages?"I asked her."No," she responded, "but look at the moon, nah?Everybody else doing it."Her tone became slightly insistent."Everybody else?"I muttered to myself, moving closer to the fence so I could see down the road.All my neighbors on the street were outside, some in the middle of the road, adults and children alike, staring up at the sky.I looked back at Che and thought about the situation.It seemed that everyone who looked at the sky was acting strange.I'd already taken a risk coming outside in the first place, but I had an idea and I pushed my luck.I shut off my phone screen and tilted the face toward the sky.It wasn't my imagination.Just above the top of the hills to the west, there were two moons in the sky.I dropped my phone."Jesus Christ!"I screamed in shock.Che turned her body in my direction."Why you won't look?"she asked, her tone betraying a little more than a hint of annoyance."I did!Y-You don't see is two moons in the sky?"I answered, composure a thing of the past."What?"she laughed.I could tell it wasn't a real laugh; her eyes were fixed and expressionless."You ever see two moons yet?There is one moon.Look!"How could she not see the second moon?"Hold on, let me send you a picture," I said, stooping to pick up my phone.It didn't make sense, but I was so unnerved that I wasn't thinking clearly.I turned the front camera on, turned my phone to the moons and snapped a photo.Somehow, when I looked away from her to take the photo, Che moved and I didn't see or hear.Now she was outside her yard, in the middle of the road, still facing me.The dogs stopped all their noise.The neighbors were no longer looking at the sky; one by one they turned to face me and began walking slowly toward my house.I felt beads of cold sweat forming on my forehead."I- You don't have to come across here you know, I could just send you the-" I began to ramble.Che let out a loud, guttural screech I never thought her capable of, pointing at me.Immediately, the swarm of neighbors rushed at my house.I didn't think, I just ran, and all my neighbors chased me like wolves chasing their prey.I ran inside the house and slammed the door shut.It didn't seem to matter to them.They kept coming, throwing themselves against the door with reckless, animalistic abandon until the hinges began to come loose.I swore under my breath, trying to think of my next move.The only other way out of the house was the back door, and the only way out of my yard was through the front gate, past the swarm.The top hinge finally broke, and as soon as I saw the first arm come through the frame, I snapped out of my indecision, making straight for the back door.The house was still dark, and I bruised myself against tables, chairs and walls in my frantic escape.I finally reached the back door and turned the knob and pulled.The knob came out of the door.I forgot that I had planned to fix that in the morning.Meanwhile, the swarm finally managed to breach the front door and began pouring into the house, knocking over all my furniture as they made their way through.I didn't have time to try the door again, so the window was my next best option.I quickly slid the window pane up and flung myself headfirst through the opening.The window slammed down behind me, alerting the horde inside my house.I didn't waste time.I ran around the house through the shade of the mango trees and ran to safety... or so I thought.Che, or whatever it was that was controlling her, was still standing between me and the road, shrieking wildly.The swarm came pouring back out of the house through the front door, they broke through my windows, and came around the sides of the house, effectively surrounding me.I had no choice.I charged full speed at Che, but she sidestepped me and tripped me with her foot, sending me tumbling onto the road outside, acquiring new cuts and bruises in the process.I tried to get up, but she kicked me in the ribs, and I screamed in pain as I felt at least two of them break."Why wouldn't you look?"she asked, putting on a tone of false pity."I will make you look."She kicked me again in the abdomen, rolling me onto my back.The swarm came and held me down.Che stooped over me and took my head in her hands, digging her well manicured nails into my face."Look!"she yelled.I shut my eyes as forcefully as I could.She pried them back open and turned my head to the west."There is no place for those who do not give in."I refused to look at the moon.I looked at her, the faces in the swarm, my damaged house, a car parked on the side of the road, anything except the moon.And there, in the reflection off the windshield, I saw hope.The moon was almost behind the hills.I had to hold on just a bit longer.Che's patience with me reached its limit.She turned her head skyward and released another scream.Somehow, I knew the tone of this scream carried finality.The swarm began to beat me relentlessly.I felt fists and kicks connect with my body like rain.I felt scratches and cuts all over me.I felt Che's nails digging deeper into my skin.I coughed and tasted blood on my tongue.I saw Che raise her hand to deliver one last blow, and I closed my eyes.I knew this was it.The hit never came.The swarm ceased its raging.I opened my eyes and looked at Che's face.She looked confused and mortified.She lowered her hand."I'm so sorry James," she began to sob, "I'm so sorry.I could see all of it.I just couldn't stop."The moons were fully blocked by the hill.
