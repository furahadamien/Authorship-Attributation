To whom it may concern,

My therapist (incidentally the same one God is currently using) has recommended to me that I start writing letters to a pen pal.I will drop it off at his office and he will send it to the anonymous reader.I think that you don't exist and he is reading this and laughing his ass off.But anyway, let's get aquatinted.I'm Death.Or the Grim Reaper.Or Hades.Or whatever you feel like calling me.My job is to take the souls of humans and bring them to wherever they need to go.Well, not me personally, I now have people to do that.I just run this rodeo.Anywho, it has been one busy week.A new war started recently (started for the same reason as any other war.This person pissed off that person) and it has been *good* for business.More souls have been picked up in the last week than any other time (besides Noah's flood, of course).So that's me right now.Business is good.Company is doing well.So I'm signing off.See ya.\-Death

To whom it may concern,

BUSINESS IS BOOMING!SO MANY SOULS!DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HELP.GOT TO GO.I'M ACTUALLY HELPING WITH THE SOULS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MILLENIA!SEE YA

\- DEATH

To whom it may concern,

Business is not booming.With all of those souls, there is too much help and not enough dying.The humans have killed so many of themselves.The world is in ruins.I have had to lay off the help.I don't know what to do.I'm at my wits end.The humans that are left are barely surviving.If they die, then I go with them.I'm going to have to think on this,

see ya,

\- death

To whom it may concern,

I have laid off everyone.It's just me now and the humans are down to a few hundred in number.I have started to help those that are left.Not visibly of course, but little things like unclogging ventilation shafts before the humans notice (because when they notice it's too late), or making sure that the few babies that are born will live.The humans don't seem to notice me.I'm worried.see ya,

To whom it may concern,

I've just overheard some humans talking.They have felt my presence when I help them.They are very grateful.Apparently they are able to sense the blockages through some fancy computers.I didn't know about these.I will have to be more careful.\- death

to whom it may concern,

They have started to notice more of my little helping actions.They are actively looking for them now.One old man has figured out who I am.He was alone; a hermit, if you will.We had a good talk before he I brought him through my door.He told me that he knew of my actions and he was thankful for all of them.He too is worried about the human race.\- death

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,

I AM OUTRAGED!THE OLD MAN TOLD THE OTHER HUMANS OF ME!HE TOLD THEM DEATH HIMSELF WAS HELPING THEM.**THEY SHOULD BE SCARED OF WHAT I AM CAPABLE OF!**

GOT TO GO MAKE SOME LIVES MISERABLE!\- DEATH

To whom it may concern,

I didn't end up doing anything to the humans.Anything I could have done, they had already done to themselves.They have started praying to me and I am confused.They even invited me to a meal.I know they can't spare a dinner; I have seen their supplies.I accept, but tell them I will not be eating.They are happy.\-Death

To whom it may concern,

When I sat down at their table, they ogled at me.They think I am a god.I am not, I assured them.They asked me why I was helping them.I told them that without, them I would die.They did not believe I was selfish.As their meal continued, they began to get drunk.The man to my left, accidentally called me Life.It spread across the table like wildfire.They christened me Life.I tried to tell them that I ferried the dead, I did not bring life or joy or happiness.They didn't believe me.\- Death

To whom it may concern, 

The humans have started to regroup.Their numbers are growing.I help them when I can, but they have started to have more souls that need ferrying as their numbers grow.Even as I ferry souls to the beyond, they still call me Life.I have decided that I have taken a liking to my name.My therapist says that this new identity was just what I have been needing.This will be my last letter, my confidant.Take care,

\- Life
