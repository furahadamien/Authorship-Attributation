The three of them each took a hit of acid and laid down to wait for its effects to kick in."You guys remember last time?Man, we were fighting the Grindle guy, and there was the wand breaking, but I just zapped him, dude.It was crazy," Ron said.His eyes were closed and his speech was already dreamily slow."Yeah, dude, I remember that.And we shoved a wand up his ass-crack!Haha, that dude is really gonna feel it when we check up on him today!"Harry added on.It was always the ass with Harry, Hermione noted, carefully observing his fingers this go around to hopefully avoid what was an impromptu rectal exam last trip when they each decided to try a slip and slide in their delusions."Watch where you're stickin' those wands, boys!"Hermione said."Wouldn't want your wand to get warts."It was always metaphors with her.Ever since being abused as child, she shied around the topic while trying to appear nonchalant, but sadly, the dildo suctioned to her stomach did little to make her appear so, rather turning her visage into that of a sex-crazed crack head.Despite the fact, the mirror spoke its lies, and her self-esteem couldn't be higher (neither could the penis, really!)So the three of them laid there, tripping out while Dumbledore, more commonly known as Carl, sat at their window, creepily peering within, having a 'trip' of his own outside, slowly painting the once brown walls white.His peeping got him only so far as his energy got the best of him and he knocked his head against the glass.The three turned their heads quickly to look at the noise, but too soon had he ducked under the window sill and shoved his face into his own paint had they seen a flit of his wispy hair, and so they turned back around thoroughly enjoying the trip and forgetting the old man.A loud bang on the door jarred them to cognition as the cops now eyed them, the window looking rather flimsy against the officer's raised baton.*Crash*

The window broke, and so did Hermione's water.The two boys dashed out of the house while she laid there, eyeing the cops with them equally eyeing her belly."Call an ambulance!She's going into pregnancy!"one of them yelled, as she slowly eyed the officers around her.They had fallen for the ole 'water balloon up the cooch trick', a timeless classic offering countless goofs, gafs, and moist pants.The men stood awkwardly around her as she eyed each of them, being mindful to keep her legs as far apart as possible to make them avert their eyes."I'll be in the other room," one of them said, and the others were soon to follow.She waited till their footsteps stopped and their bated whispers began about the absolutely raunchy dame before she began climbing through the broken window.Once outside, she met her two amigos on the side of the house, each of them leaning up against the panelling like they were tilted on their backs."Woah, bro, this is like, totally gnar gnar," Ron said."I know, right, dude?Totally radical."And so the three of them began their long trek to the closest Waffle House, each of them frolicking on their ponies and pausing to examine the wonders, all of which were imaginary.---
