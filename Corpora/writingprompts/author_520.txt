She didn't understand this change in her father.She was accustomed to him focusing more on his work than on her.Frankly, she couldn't remember the last time he picked her up from school at all and now he had shown everyday this week.And to top it off, there he was, sitting in the front row of her play.You see, Carly's father was a high powered lawyer.He made sure that Carly and her mother were well taken care of, but his singular focus had resulted in divorce and a distinct form of absentee parenting.For her dad, the next big case was always his immediate aim, while maintaining his 5.0 rating on Martindale-Hubbell was his mission statement.And now that had changed.Here he was, driving her home for his weekend instead of telling her to use the credit card he gave to pay for an Uber.And now all the small-talk."How was school?She knew he would pay for college right?Does she have a boyfriend?Did she need a dress for prom"?None of this would prepare her for the new CR-V parked in the driveway.It was time that she had her own car he said.Nothing too fancy, but something safe and practical.This was weird.Carly should have been happy.But she wasn't.It all felt wrong and forced.So that night, after her dad went to sleep (after watching television with her, something that hadn't happened for at least 5 years), Carly walked around the house and tried to make sense of her dad.She was honestly concerned that he was sick, maybe it was cancer.Maybe this is his chance to make everything right before he left.But she didn't find anything.No doctors notes, no medical correspondence, nothing out of the ordinary.Her dads house was immaculate.He loved to display his trophies from his high school wrestling days, all of the articles with his picture from the law firm, and he even had a custom-built electronic sign that listed his gamer score on the Xbox.No, she wasn't likely to find anything here.If he was dying, he would keep that from her.And he wouldn't leave the papers out.There was a mug sitting out though.It looked like the #1 Dad mug she bought him a couple of years ago, but it had "# 5,478,888 Dad" on it.Carly thought that that was a weird gag gift for someone to get him.Still, he had been so nice, she figured she'd put it away for him.The next morning the news broke that all of the mugs had changed.It was then that Carly realize that her dad was addicted to winning.
