Life?There is no such thing, the concept is an acquiescent notion as a result of my handiwork.Akin to how a shadow only exists where there is light, life only comes to be when death is ubiquitous, where without such a thing, just to *be* would not be such a strange notion.They hail me as some divine deliverance, but if only they knew how much better off they would be without me.I am nothing but a parasite upon their existence, formed by opportunity and sustained by ignorance.Yet me being aware of such details helps no one, for like any other animal, I place myself above all things and cannot help them *truly*, for such a thing would be  my own doom.When there were many of them, trading their existence for my own was not something I thought much about.For my own subsistence, it was what had to be done.Stopping to think about how one is breathing is not something done too often, but that air was thin and depleting and now I must be conscious of my actions.I am not able to avoid ruminating on the subject... one wrong misstep and their doom means my own, so our goals just happen to align in this sense.Just as they are conscious of my mannerisms, I am conscious of theirs.Throughout history, I could not help but familiarize myself with their thoughts, languages, and cultures.It was a thing that helped my craftto be surebut to do what I do without understanding the subject would be foolhardy.A few of them surprised me, and I even attempted to befriend them at some points, but breaking my code would be true evil.My indiscriminate method is a result of the relativity of morality.How could I choose who lived and who died?True, I have the power to do so, but not the ideals, nor the absolute knowledge to devise such a system.The dead young, old, and good of society are due to my own failings to establish an absolute moral compass.They must die because I do not fully comprehend them, and my avarice forces my hand regardless.In this crumbled society, they may see my restrained actions as a source of life, but they needn't forget that I am death.
