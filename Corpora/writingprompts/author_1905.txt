I still clearly remember the details of his face, from exactly 202 years ago.So boyish, with an old, red scar from his cheekbone all the way down to his neck, the only flaw in his handsome face.I was a young girl then and had followed my fathers footsteps in helping the injured and fallen in battle.My father took great pride in teaching me and despite my age, I was able to quickly stop bleeding and provide relief.Naive and wanting to make my father proud, I had run into the thick of war that morning.I spotted him lying in the dirt, his armour, much more elaborate than any other I had seen.I rushed over and saw that he was bleeding profusely from his neck.That pale boyish face, sweat dripping..

Before I could finish my train of thought, my colleague Burke shook me.Hes awake!How did you do it?! Burke exclaimed.I looked over to the soldier beside me.He stirred slightly.Oh, he must be lucky, you know. I said.Burke looked at me suspiciously.You always get the lucky ones.Well, I guess its lucky for us all that we did not lose another soldier.They need all the help they can get out there.

Unbeknownst to Burke, I had transfused a large amount of my blood to the soldier beside me.Since saving the man with the scar those many years ago, I had become immortal.My blood brought heavily injured soldiers back from the brink of death.I had to be careful in not using this too often though.People around me were starting to get suspicious and it drained all my energy.For the longest time as well, I didnt think I had to use my abilities much as the world had been at peace.However, 2 years ago, an aggressive king had risen and waged war across the lands.This ravaged cities that were unprepared and had not seen war in generations.The King was hated by all, and rumours said, including his very own army.However, victory seemed to follow him everywhere.The city I was in was about to fall to his army.Word had reached that the King himself was leading the troops to their assured victory.Sure enough, by morning, the city had fallen.Burke stood next to me as the victory parade stormed the inner parts of this old city.As the parade passed me, I looked carefully at the faces of the soldiers, so much blood, so much cruelty..

Then suddenly, in the middle of the parade, an unmistakable face.There was no smile.He was looking straight ahead.On the right of his face, a red scar from the top of his cheekbone down to his neck.He hadnt aged a day, just like me.
