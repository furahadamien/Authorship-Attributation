Day One: A long walk back to the office.Anger at myself.Anger at the unfairness of language.Anger at everything.I went to the bathroom and had a long sit in the atalls, just time to think.Except that I accidentally sat in that stall.The one that never completely flushes.The one that's backed up three times.We've told corporate about it repeatedly, but no one ever gets sent up.Too much cost to hire a good plumber, not enough slack in the budget.I'm fed up.I have an idea.Day Two: I walk into the office in blue jeans and an old.t-shirt, carrying an old sack of tools.Marty stops me.He asks when I'm going to be done with my end on the new license.I tell him that I won't be in my office today.I'll be in the bathroom.He winces and reminds me that it's important.I offer to turn my computer on so someone else can work on my files.And then I disappear into the restroom.Other guys poke their heads into the stall now and then.They ask how long I'll be.They laugh when I forget to tighten a valve before removing the old water tube.They look something up on YouTube when I ask them.At 3:00 PM, I'm covered in water and a bit of a smell.The toilet completely flushes.The office mockingly cheers as I saunter out.Even Marty......

Day Five: Marty knocks on my door.He tells me that he's ready to pass the new license project down to sales, and he needs me to finish my piece in time to show the new customer.I don't even look up from my monitor as I tell him no.He says that we're talking about a big contract, something that corporate is going to be really proud of.I tell him no, in a simple tone, with no anger, no spite, no glee.Just no.Marty's words are exasperated.He understands now.He sees that I'm going to spend the rest of my life slacking off, getting paid for nothing.He asks, with a sneer in his voice, what am I going to do then?I tell him, I'm going to write documentation for the main library.There's a pause.He asks me what I mean.I tell him that we've wanted to create an internal wiki page for the main library for years, but corporate refuses to let us.We're not supposed to waste time on documentation, especially something that could be easily copied and given away.So it's always hell for our new employees to find their way around the basic loading screens.So today, I'm uploading some basic wiki software on to out internal site, and I'm starting to write documentation.There's another pause, then a chuckle.Marty says, you know, that this will only work for me.Anyone else who updates this will could get suspended.I reply, in the same stoic tone, that I can upload anything that anyone else gives me, and I'll never need to tell corporate where it came from.There's another pause.A longer one.Marty walks close.He leans in and whispers something in my ear.He sounds... optimistic.Day Twenty-Three: Richard walks in my office.He's not happy, but he's pretending to be.He's laughing like someone who's trying very hard to laugh.He's making jokes to himself.And he's got several emails from corporate.The wiki needs to go.He can't stay on the internal site.It's taking time away from other projects.It's too easy to access from outside.It needs to go.And I'm the only one with access.They'd need to reformat and reboot several servers to get it off without my permission.He asks one more time, in a stern, bouncy voice, to remove the documentation.And I reply one more time, in a calm, confident tone, no.There's a long pause.He stands silent in the doorway.I continue typing.He walks close to me, like he's going to put his hands on his shoulders.He leans down and whispers to me.There's a new batch of college grads coming in for new employee orientation.He mentions that we've had problems getting new hires through orientation, since they don't always have access to their mentors.It would be helpful if we had the answer keys and study guides online in one place, so that the kids could do their own research if needed, but corporate demands that we only give the mentors access to that work.He drops a USB stick in my lap.I nod.He quietly leaves......

Day 237: Richard opens the door.He nods at me, then at the two people with him, then he leaves.I've never seen these two people before.They've got fashionable clothes, bright faces, genuine smiles.I assume I'm looking at someone from corporate, someone executive.The man speaks first.He introduces them both, asks me how I'm doing, compliments my work on the license project.They try to make small talk, ask about my family, ask about my hobbies.I reply with single-word answers.I don't go into many details.But I do remind them that I don't do much work on the license project anymore.I try not to look worried, try not to worry that they've found some loophole to get rid of me.I think to turn the tables on them.I ask how they're doing, how their projects are going, how they're getting along with the license project.They glance at each other, looking confident themselves.The woman mentions that they've been having problems with the new customer.They keep wanting changes to the loading screens.They keep wanting to restructure forma and change file formats.We never seem to be able to please them.But corporate refuses to put a foot down on it.We're expected to give them whatever they want.And anyone who tells them that it can't be done is written up for demotion.They've already lost three good employees trying to push back on them, and the other teams are getting tired of their demands.She repeats, in a forceful tone, that anyone who tells them differently is demoted or fired.Anyone.They both smile politely.I smile back.We've never gotten on well with the sales teams, but I feel like we have an understanding.Day 239: The customer is literally turning red in the face.He slams a stack of papers on the desk in front of me.He calls the information out of place, hard to read, useless for his team.He says that his old provider never refused to switch layouts when he asked for them.He asks who we hire hat could be so slow, so incompetent.He wants a deadline.He wants the date that we can add the new data fields and reformat the database.I smile, politely, and tell him again that we're already working on a new version, and he won't have any new changes until we start planning the next release after that.This repeats several times.The customer always finds a new way to blame my staff.He always finds a new way to praise his old provider.He even starts inventing new things that he needs.He never declares that he'll be dropping his contract with us.I eventually leave, quietly, politely......

Day 240: When I arrive in the morning, there's a large box of donuts in the break room, with a note from the sales team.A kind note.Marty wanders in, acting like he barely notices the snacks.He mutters a harsh word under his breath, something about how I'm too important to waste my time in sales, something about how there's plenty enough work to do on this side of the building.His right hand scrawls a note on a piece of paper.His left hand idly lifts the box and pulls a glazed donut out, as if the left and the right don't know what the other is doing.He drops the note in front of me and wanders away.I finish my coffee before reading it.Someone needs to rewrite the help page for last year's project.Our smaller customers complain about it every week.Even our employees claim they don't know what that project is doing, and the documentation is no help.They need someone to work on it, but no one has the time.If anyone else wasted time on it, they'd be reprimanded by corporate for not following the main project.The employees need it done, but there's never enough manpower to do what needs to be done.And I think to myself, I wonder if that genie knew that flameproof skin would be a much lesser gift than respect.
