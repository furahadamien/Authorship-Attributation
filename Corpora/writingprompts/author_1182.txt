I never asked for this.Honestly, I was just in it for the chicks.Maybe if I'd been born in a different time, I would've been a different man.There's certainly... *something* in my blood that coils and lashes when the stakes are high.But there's not much occasion for that these days.There's some sort of seal on the local evil that weakens every hundred years or so and I was born right in the middle of two comings.I guess I'm a part of the family of local legends, but that's not really relevant right now.Pretty sure I'm dead."Looking at these accomplishments," boomed the powerful voice of the table's obvious head, "or lack thereof, I hope you have a good reason for bringing him before us, Loki."The wizened figure's eyes wrinkled with dubious curiosity."Perhaps 'One-Eyed' refers to your mind as well?"A lithe, no, tenuously-formed figure chided.When speaking, this Loki snapped like a serpent.In his silence, he somehow took the appearance of a cautious wolf."Not that I mean to offend, All Father," his features softened and shifted to godlike perfection and serenity, "But a man, a *hero* must be judged by the heroism of his actions given the lot he is drawn, should he not?"A gleaming hammer split the table like thunder a log."You're mad, Loki!Where shows he the mettle of a true warrior of Valhalla in this?What say you is his weapon?This?"Shards of the table's destruction still drifted down, setting a ridiculous scene.This third, golden-maned beast of a man held my spatula with clear disdain as the other two pushed back slightly from the splintered remains.Yeah, a spatula.I mentioned I didn't have much reason to be a hero or warrior, didn't I?My life's mission consisted of flipping pancakes and "carrying on the family legacy", which I generally interpret as getting laid.Come to think of it, though, the last thing I remember is an explosive pop and the squeal shearing metal.Nothing exciting, I'm afraid.I was in the kitchen, after all, frying an order and daydreaming about Sonia before everything went black.But Valhalla?Loki?Why am I... Is this really...

"Do continue, Loki.Neither Thor nor I have time for a farce.""As you wish.And, Thor, do clean up your mess," Loki chided."This man before you, Juese, fights for his bloodline."My jaw slacked.Loki regaled the other two with stories of my family that even I didn't know.He explained the hundred-year lapses.The need to carry on the name, to pass our supernatural power to face Dracula and his legions to the next generation.The dust settled with the mood and the air stilled."I am beginning to see your case for this one, blood-brother.A man such as he fights a tragic battle against circumstance, but still he fights."The blonde figure, Thor, said as he rolled a sliver of the table between his fingers."He continues his clan's war."A womanizer for justice.A warrior who cast down his whip to equip a spatula to keep his name alive.Such is the light in which I was cast.It didn't really sound that heroic to me, but Thor seemed to eat up Loki's honeyed platter of words.The features of the elder, who I had by now surmised was Odin, had relaxed as well.Perhaps a hint of excitement curled his lip... or am I projecting?My head swam in the possibilities."Very well, Loki.You have made your case, no, this warrior's case clear.And he truly did fall on his own sort of battlefield.A stove door is an uncommon projectile, but it struck true as any arrow."Odin stood, pointing the majestic spear at his side towards me."I sense a strong energy within him and believe that he will prove useful come Ragnarok.A hero of steaks and stakes!He shall crack pepper and whips!My chef and child in the final battle."A smirk flashed on Loki's now-vulpine countenance."Without further delay, welcome to Valhalla, Juese Belmont."My smile shone back as bright as my spatula."Glad to be here, Loki.Now about those Valkyries I've heard so much about?"---
