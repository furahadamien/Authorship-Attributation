"23 dead in recent crime spreed lead by-"

I didn't need to finish the headline.I already recognized the face.Even with that garish mask, and purple-green suit, its hard not to recognize your own face.I didn't want to finish the headline, because I'd already finished reading the article below the fold.I had flipped the paper over, just like an anyone else might, to see what villain was responsible for the deaths I'd just read about.A part of me wishes they'd done a better job combing through my stuff, removing all the "memorabilia".There was several more papers, just like this one, stashed away in the simple black briefcase.A part of me wishes I hadn't found the disgusting thing in the first place.And now, I sit.Reading through the pages.Reading through the names.Reading through what i'd done.Failing to tell myself it wasn't me.Failing to tell myself I was doing better as a teacher.Failing to forget like I'd been forced to only 5 years ago.Well.Today.I'm going to be a hero.
