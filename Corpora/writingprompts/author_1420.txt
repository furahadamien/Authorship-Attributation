Why are they so damned hard to kill now?There were so many of them before.When these frail things began to play with power they didn't understand, I knew I was in for a treat.I watched in delight as they snuffed each other out in droves.There were too many anyway.Not enough to go around in the end.This would be a good thing for them.They would bounce back like they always do.The cycle would begin again as it always did.I would again know the joy of claiming them.Giving them my justice.Be it a boon or a curse, it was all the same to me.There were so many weak links to pressure into feeding my lust.An insult here, a nudge there.I whispered in their ears that they would be hailed as the saviors of their race.There are so few now.Good.When I reap the last one I will finally be free of my wretched existence.I am the cold hand in the night.They call me Death.As if the apes could comprehend it.I've always been proud of my grim duty.Before it was because I thought myself noble.A teacher for these primitive beings.Showing them the sins of the forebearers and allowing them to learn and grow from it.I used to think I was the one to shepard them into a golden age.Show them how to become more.I thought their potential took form when I saw them spread to the stars.I knew the cycle would continue.I could continue my work until I was no longer needed.A shadow in the back of their minds to push them ever forward.Then, instead of looking outward at the marvels around them, they looked inward.They turned on each other.I would reap their souls, thinking the others would learn as I had always intended.Instead, they fed on their own hate and ignored my lessons.This race learned nothing now.I have grown to hate them for this.I began to enjoy my time with new entertainment.Chemical weapons that burned at the water they carried within them, making them scream in agony.I wanted them to suffer as I suffered.I bathed them in the warmth of their own nuclear flame.When their bombs began to fray the thread that held together their new found homes, I let their homes take revenge.Sudden and swift catastrophe to erase their taint.The planets shed their own blood across their faces just to be rid of the plague called man.The apes fled to the last rock that tolerated them on it's surface.Their primordial Mother and the only one that wouldn't turn them away in their final hour.She was always too kind to them.They've been bleeding her with wild abandon, but she perseveres to give them all she has.Such is a Mother's love I suppose.She cradled them in her arms again yet the fire burned on.Now there are so few I can't find any to pit them against.I have to use a more... direct approach now.An itch at the back of the mind, reminding them of their loss.For some the itch is so unbearable they scratch at it until it festers and they cleanse it from their brain with a bullet.The rest begin to adapt by clumping together where they can to find a salve in each other.They should have been easy prey again.Yet they no longer hear my whispers to turn on each other.I won't let them continue after what they've done.When the last of their ilk falls I can finally know peace.Be rid of my pain by inflicting it on them.When they die, I die.Returning to the void, where I can't feel the sting of their betrayal.I set small traps for them.A natural gas leak when they think they've found a stove that works.Three burned that day, but I watched in horror as their compatriots rushed in with the bane of my existence.They call it "medicene" and because of it there are no souls to reap today.I curse them for finding a way around their doom.I try to bring them famine hoping I could just force them to eat each other.The fiends huddle in caves to share what nourishment they have, denying me my revenge.They continue to survive my assaults to my dismay.Their Mother tries to shield them from my wrath.Bringing them rain to reward their insolence.The selfish brats keep me locked in my rage.I set more traps but they notice my patterns now.They get harder to catch off guard.I lay loose trash over a pit as one walks alone.She's headed right for it and I shake with anticipation at my first catch in what feels like ages.I watch her as she mumbles something about Winter turning to Spring when she suddenly drops to her knees.No.She can't possibly know what lies ahead.She pulls out a pendant from under her shirt and kisses it.I sigh in relief when she stands and begins forward again.She comes to the edge of my trap.She looks right at it and I hear her words."Thank you Life.Please continue to show me how my story can end."She says, "Remind me of my mortality to keep me humble, remind me that equality is found by all in death.Thank you Life for showing me the dangers that surround your gift, giving it a preciousness my people forgot.Amen."My hate focuses on this sanctimonious amoeba.I catch a glimpse of her pendant.A scythe.I realise in disgust that she was talking to me.Praying to me like one of their pagan Gods.The fools think their own adaptations to my machinations some gift from their imaginary heavens.They have even stripped me of name.The call me "Life" now.Try as I might, they always see through any deception I create to claim them.They continue to narrowly miss calamity and falsely interpret the acts as signs of my protection.I nudge the mountains to shake loose a rain of crushing death.As the boulders speed to their path, they stop walking.They spread out, drop to their knees and reach for the pointless baubles around their necks.The boulders come crashing down towards the party of meatbags, but they don't move.The rock slide tumbles through their ranks and misses every one.Every damned one.They celebrate by embracing each other, cheering that Life had saved them once again.How cruel my existence has become to rob me of my own peace.Quietly, one slips away in the night.I reap him, gaining little satisfaction from an old man dying peacefully in his sleep.My jealousy burns in me.They can die independent of one another, while I am stuck here until my duty carried out.When the last ape coughs out it's death rattle, I may know the peace denied to me.Now, when all I want is for them to cease, they realize the lessons I tried to teach them before.They have learned humility.They honor their dead by thanking them for the mistakes they made, so they can be passed down to the next generation.This is the final insult.When I loved them, they hated me.Now when I hate them they love me.Not what I am now, but what I was.Only now that they can see my hand all around them do they change their ways.They were supposed to do this on their own.Guiding themselves to glory, with only their own mortality pushing them onward.In my attempts to extinguish them I begin to see again what I loved in the first place.When their numbers dwindle to a dozen in a single tribe, I see the end of my hate.A child is born to the first woman that saw me.It's beauty startles me, awakening something I thought lost.The guilt of a millennia tormenting these creatures assails me all at once.The shepard in me sees what I have wrought and weeps.They were not my creation, but they were my charge.How could I have failed them so completely?I now embrace the shepard I was to atone for what I've done.I make my traps less elaborate and easier to spot.They continue to sense them, stopping before the dangers can strike.I play into the myth they made for me.I intentionally allow them to dodge my scythe so they keep their humility.Those that grow vain, ignore the signs and become the mistakes the rest are now grateful for.They help each other, show respect to one another and a love that binds them together.I set more traps for them to see and veer away from.In doing so I guide them to food and clean water.They reclaim the parts of the past that made them great and discard the rest.I can hardly believe it's the same species.Their numbers continue to swell, as does my love.They show a bond their ancestors never had and for the first time I feel hope for a dream once lost.They have finally fulfilled their destiny to become what I first saw in their fledgling race.They continue to pray to "Life".Though it is not my name or my nature.I will claim this mantle.I accept it's heavy burden and vow to never abandon them again.Their Mother was right all along.They are worth saving.
