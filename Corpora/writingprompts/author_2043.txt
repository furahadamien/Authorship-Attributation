"You will ferry the souls of the dead to eternal rest," said the light."and you will be known as death."Of course, this is translated so you modern men and women can understand.The light had spoken to me in my native language when I was born.It said I was the first human to die.I learned thousands of years later what human meant.Originally, I would be what be what you modern people call a neolithic man.That was thousands of years ago, and I have naturally changed to match the era.At first I was the great hunter, the one that caught all quarry.Then I was the reaper, a skelatal figure who carried a symbolic scythe.And now...I am a "normal" man again.You might have seen me.Sickly white complexion, nice and kept hair, a perfect smile.I may have passed you on my way to a hospital, ready to lead the next batch of souls to eternal peace.Of course, you shouldn't think about it too much.I have had to lead souls who had died from being stressed.Before you ask, all dogs do go to this light.I dont know what is on the other side of the light.I've never been allow to pass.I tried when I first died.That was when I was given this job.It is depressing, guiding soldiers who will never be found, sickly children, even the people who took their own lives.Someone has to do this job, however.And frankly, I don't mind it anymore.I may occasionally get reminded how dark this job can be, but I can't get into that.It is my job to be the welcoming smile to all those who die.I have to go.A veteran needs to see his wife again.
