Hello.I see you've finally figured it out.I always knew one day you might.How long has it been?Roughly two years?Yes, that sounds about right.I suppose your own perception of time has changed a bit, too.But anyway.I'm glad you did.I'm glad you reached out to me.And by what means!I applaud you, really.A fanciful post in a popular internet platform.An innocent thing to gather imaginative minds.Brilliant!I suppose you have questions.Tons of them.About the nature of time, about me, about yourself.As you might imagine, I am not yet willing to give you everything.I have no idea who you are, and what you would do with the information.As you realised, I am doing this at will.Simply put, I stop time.For a short spell, yes.I am trying to make it last longer (from my and your perspective, of course) but so far I have not been able to bear the pressure for longer than what feels like a few minutes.Do you feel it too?That pressure in the back of your head?I do not suppose you do.How did it start and why does it happen to you?I don't want to give too much away right now, as it would endanger some people.Still I'll tell you this.Science was involved.An accident occurred.You were collateral and absolutely random.They tried to find you, but they never did: another accident occurred.It happens, I suppose.What do I do when time stops?I see you have been having fun.At least after the few initial and totally understandable breakdowns, that is.And considering you have no idea when it happens it's the only thing to do.I wonder what mischief you did.It must be very interesting to be able to move through the non-time without having to maintain the effect.I have quite mastered by now, but takes a toll on me.Think solving equations while lifting weights and trying to dictate a groceries list.It doesn't allow me as much freedom of action as it apparently does to you.Which brings me to my next and final point.I am turning this into a profession.A side thing for now, but who knows?I could very much use the talents of someone like you.I will be watching closely now that I've found you.Trying to figure out the type of person you are.You might hear from me again.
