Confused to what I just saw, I asked the stoic stranger, What the heck is going on?

You pickpocketed the wrong person or thing.That thing lying on the floor is an alien species called walletoid.They control human-like ships to infiltrate our society. The stranger said sternly.Are you serious?! I said anxiously.No!You are actually part of a live broadcast of To Scare a Thief! the stranger said as he began to unveil his tuxedo and camera men appeared out of nowhere.Wow I guess I learned my lesson huh. I said while blushing.I dont think I ever pickpocketed again since that day.
