"Fear not death, for till the time comes death is the protector of life" - Saying from a South Asian Warrior Tribe.For millennia I had been a reaper of souls, the dark one, the entity that the world feared but grudgingly accepted.Il Muerte, The Grim Reaper, Maut and countless others, every language ever spoken had a name for me.A name always remembered.Trillions upon trillions of souls I had ferried from their bodies to their judgement and yet here I was looking at my own end."For an immortal you aren't all that" I said to myself with a dry chuckle.I had had a great last few years, the wars to end all wars was actually a war that ended the world as mankind knew it and I had a great time.My power was at its peak, I was reaping souls in the millions everyday and then it ended.There just weren't enough humans left in the world to fight it anymore.Then I noticed something, as the time passed and my reaping was limited to a handful a day, my power waned.It was like Il Muerte was getting old and that's when the realisation hit.My power was directly related to the number of souls I harvested.The scythe grew rusty in my hands as the humans progressively decreased.That's when I thought of my end and saw it was near for Death can only exist as long as there is life.---------------------------

The man sat and waited, it had been a few days since he had eaten something warm and now the roots and bugs that he had found sustenance in were depleted in his domain.So he sat near the watering hole praying to a God that didn't listen for food.As he waited, I watched, sending out tendrils of thought looking to find some meat for this haggard soul.I sensed a beaver nearby, I teased the Beavers mind slowly drawing him closer to the watering hole.The man heard the underbrush breaking under the Beavers fat tail and he tensed holding onto the rock hoping, wishing, praying.The beaver came into sight and adrenaline coursed through the man's veins.I could smell his hunger and desire.The beaver was cautious, looking around, sniffing the air and I was getting bored of it.I squeezed the beaver's brain, killing caution and it leaned forward to drink.The man had been waiting for this moment.I saw the hope in his eyes as he threw the rock at the beaver's head, his aim was true but malnutrition had taken its toll the rock bounced off the head and the beaver ran as the man broke into sobs with thoughts of killing himself.I reached out and snapped the beaver's neck.As the dust settled the man saw the dead beaver lying on the ground as I moved away to find another life the last thing I saw was the blood running down the lips of the man tearing into the raw flesh, his blood pumping and strength flooding his veins, offering his gratitude to God and Life.This one would live for me to reap another day.--------------------------

The little girl child burnt with fever, the mother trying to keep her cool put leaves soaked in water over her forehead.Every few hours the body of the little girl would be racked by spasms, the mother was trying all that she could but deep down she knew that the girl barely had a chance.Between bouts of fever the girl would lie there half dead, breathing but not moving.In one such bout the the mother lay her head to the ground calling out to "Allah" begging pleading  for respite.When none came she renounced her God screaming profanities at him.The girl was getting worse by the hour and the feverish episodes were getting closer to each other.The mother had seen people die from this fever hysterical and spasming.A long drawn out scream of frustration and helplessness left the mothers throat.As I passed by I reached into the girl and reaped the bacteria that ravished the little body.The last image I saw as I left was the girl opening her eyes and calling out to her mother.Colour coming back to her cheeks and the mother silently crying paying her respects to Life.This one will bear me others that I shall one day take.------------------------------

There were others, as my power waned I kept them alive and they grew.Mankind was always resilient, they grew bouncing back from the brink of extinction.Surviving, slowly forming communities, growing, they would talk to each other about their exceptionally long lifespans and how living off the land had made them strong and how Life had been kind to them.They grew back to some semblance of a society and then it started again.As they became bigger greed and lust took over.The bigger they became the more it effected them as people.Two tribes, they broke out into war over hunting land.Rallying under torn banners, war cries ringing, they marched to battle  

I watched, almost at the end of my time, as the front lines charged towards each other, landing blows with primitive weapons.Human blood was spilled and I felt it rush into my veins as my lips split into a smile a laugh started deep in my being.As I swung the scythe, the only thought that I had was.If it lives.It will die.--------------------------------------------------------------------
