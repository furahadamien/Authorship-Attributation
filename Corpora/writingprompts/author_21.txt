I'd found a kindred soul in Hitler.We were both so passionate, so persuasive.I taught him to paint with calm strength.And fervent joy.I never wavered from my convictions even as he never wavered from his.I of the happy trees, and he of the vile untermensch.In the end, I did teach him to be a good painter.I wept when he died.It was a congenital heart defect, no time traveler had put it there.That was when I realized he had taught me something too.No one will recognize me without this ridiculous hair.
