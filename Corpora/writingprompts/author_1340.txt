He never understood how she knew when he was in trouble, or how she appeared at his side so quickly.They never spoke outside of his messes, had no kind words for each other.They never had.Yet as he struggled to open his second bottle of 90 proof be could hear the jiggle of a key in the lock and he knew.She was here.In desperation he kept struggling with the corkscrew top.The atrocity that was his life needed to end.The front door closed.Keys clinked onto the poor excuse of his entry table.Dhakdhak.His heart beat faster as he struggled.He could see her hanging up her coat, taking off her shoes, glancing at her phone because...quite frankly...he wasn't worth hurrying for.Not that he could remember ever seeing a phone in her hand.With bleary eyes he watched her walk past him, into the kitchen.His chest clenched.Not even a glance of acknowledgment.Her movement was graceful.Sometimes he could swear she got more elegant every time.He swore as his hand slipped, bruising against the bottle."Fucking piece of shit. Had he more energy he would have chucked the bottle against the wall.Instead she removed it from his hands."Fucking bitch, give that back," he snarled and snapped, his fists opening and closing until she shoved the water bottle into his grasp."Drink," she ordered.Her tone demanded no argument despite the softly spoken words.He stared at her eyes, the color of bromegrass, seeing nothing save for his sorry ass and the acceptance she wore with such ease."I'll drink if it's from your pussy," he offered, struggling to his feet and failing to give her a charming grin.She didn't bat an eye.He staggered toward her, only to  find himself back on the couch, staring up at the yellowing popcorn ceiling.Had he blacked out?She stared down at him, cherry pink lips turned up in an unmistakable smirk.Humiliation filled him and he tried to make a grab for her leg, but she knew his moves too well.Her knee length skirt swayed teasingly across her ochre skin."Get back here.I'll show you..." He tumbled onto the floor.She ignored him as he lay there and began to clean up the infestation of dishes and paraphernalia that had accumulated around the unholy tissues."Don't throw it out!"The order sounded more like begging to his ears."Drink and I won't."Her straightforward answers were something he still couldn't get used to.After a moment's hesitation he obeyed.She could have had a life.With her calm and humble demeanour, her wits, and grades...she could have gone on and done something important with her life.Become a trusted politician, or an empathetic doctor.Gods, why she stayed was beyond him.It was probably beyond her too.He wondered if she ever questioned the strangeness of it all.After all, he had promised his little brother he would take care of her, but had made no promise to her.Not that he would have intended to honor it either way.Simple coincidence had seen that he had.Was it a coincidence?"Ten years," he muttered.Ten years and she had become a nurse working double shifts at the local hospital and picking him up from alleyways and bar fights.He knew she wouldnt have stayed in this forsaken city if not for him.If not for...that."I stopped by to clean the grave today.Your parents had already been so I left some blossoms instead.""He was such a goddamn pussy," he grumbled.Ulric had been the sort of person who enjoyed girlish things like animals and poetry.A natural wimp; a coward.What she had seen in his little brother had always been beyond him."I know what you think," she sighed.Such comments had used to insight anger, but he had made them too many times and she was weary of them.He was weary of saying them.The non-reaction depleted his will to start a fight.He turned the water bottle in his hands and took a swig.It burned more than the alcohol had."How were you planning on doing yourself in this time?"Her voice cut through his thoughts and he shrugged, unable to look at her.His gaze dropped to his wrists, scarred as they were.Every time he tried to bring the end was different.Every time she showed up to stop him.She truly hated him."Drowning in your drink?, she continued.You already have enough liver damage.No need to add any more brain damage either."He didn't have the energy to glare, which is probably the only reason she risked taking  a seat on the couch.So he tried to bury his face into her chest.Her hand grabbed his face and pushed him back, nearly knocking his head against the heavy wood of the coffee table."Oh, c'mon..." he whined, licking his lips."Diana..."

"You're cuter when you're docile," she said flatly.He shivered at the edge of cold.Instead of give in he responded: "I'm a man.Men aren't docile.We take what we want and give as good as we get."Your brother was more of a man at fifteen than you ever have been in your life.

A flash of red hid reality.He lunged at her, hand raised to smack the insolent words out of her.He curled fingers into the collar of her blouse, determined not to stop until she gave to him.Instead her hand touched his cheek, gentle and warm.His legs almost gave way.He didnt get a single hit in as the craving for such warmth rolled over him, crashing and exploding.His breathing was ragged.Sit down before you hurt yourself.

Fuck you, he spat, his hitting hand falling to her shoulder to shake her.You ugly cunt.Youre only good for --- Images of her pulled into memory and he choked on his words.The only time he had come to her aid she had been sprawled out on a bed in her uncle's house, lounging but not really.Despite her motionless and nude state there had been muscles that spasmed uncontrollably.There had been a dead look in her eyes.He had thought for the first few seconds that she was thinking of Ulric and had summoned him as some sort of twisted replacement.The truth had been far worse.By the time he had finished beating her uncle, the man had been near dead.The uncle and his family had later moved out of the city, leaving Diana alone.The dickface had never come back.Of course he had tried the same thing later.Theyd been at the same party.Shed been drunk.Even as he had been slamming his fists into her uncles face he could understand why the brute had done it.Yet when it had come to the act he had been part of so many times with women and girls who were not her, he had not been able to follow through.It was the only time hed ever seen her drunk.She rescued him later that week from some dealers he had failed to swindle.Why do you stay? he demanded, sinking his fingers into her shoulders until she flinched.Why do you?

She simply accepted the abuse until he was calm enough to hear her.Ullie and I never had any intention of leaving this city, she said, helping him down onto the couch again as he began to shake.And since then...you and I are the only family weve got. Her arms wrapped around him, protective and gentle until he couldnt take the kindness anymore and burst into sobs that had been held at bay for too many years.When the hell had he become such a pathetic waste of space?
