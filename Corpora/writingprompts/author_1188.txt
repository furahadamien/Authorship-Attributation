"It's for cooking," Thor said with a derisive snort.I had just died and, apparently, ye old god of thunder was not impressed.I tried to muster up a retort, some defense of my manhood and bravery, but it was like shouting into the thunderstorm.The acoustics in here were just terrible for mortal voices.Fortunately the ever-wise Loki had agreed to speak on my behalf."And hammers are for smithing, dear Thor.Are you such a poor warrior that you cannot afford a real weapon?"Loki smiled politely at the god at the other end of the hall.One of the younger goddesses standing by the wall gasped and then covered her mouth.She, and the rest of the pantheon, turned to face the often violent and always short-tempered son of Odin.Thor scowled and put his hand on Mjlnir.The air, I swear, became darker.I don't mean that someone dimmed the torches.The air itself took on a quality of stifling blackness.It was as if death stood behind Thor and cast a long shadow in my direction.For a moment I was sure that this hearing would turn into an execution and I wondered whether it was possible to die a second time.I instinctively reached out towards the spatula sitting on the table.Exhibit 1 and only.If I was going to die I'd go down swinging the only weapon I'd ever wielded.Loki put his hand on my shoulder and shook his head no.The angry god broke the silence and spat on the ground, "you overstep your bounds Loki.There is no one in this hall who doubts my valor.Follow me outside and see for yourself."Loki put his hands up in mock surrender."Now, now, there is no need for that Thor.As you say, no one here can question your valor.You have proven it time and again."The darkness seemed to subside.Thor looked placated though his hand never left his hammer.Loki continued, "why, you slew rymr with a single blow from Mjlnir, a feat that no one before or after has or will ever match.All the nine realms recognize it as a most terrifying weapon in your hands.And yet it would be nothing more than a hindrance in mine."His flattery was obvious to everyone in the room.Well, almost everyone."Finally, you speak some sense," Thor said with a bellow."You are no warrior Loki.I could rock the very foundation of Jtunheimr with this.You could not kill a troll sunbathing at noon."Thor laughed and the room shook with him.I gripped the arms of the chair to stop from falling out.Loki waited patiently for the laughter to die down."True.I am no warrior.Every Aesir knows that I am not one to bear arms.But Thor, Harhugar, Vingrr, nemesis to the serpent Jrmungandr, you do not know the deeds of this man."Loki gestured for me to stand up.I did.Then I waved, partly because I was nervous but mostly because they never covered mortal to god etiquette at Columbia.After I realized how ridiculous I looked, I gracefully transitioned the wave into a simple thumbs up.Loki pushed me back into my seat."He slew a terrible beast, one with venom more deadly than that of the world serpent.It pounces like the great horse Sleipnir with legs that move like lightning.Its eyes encircle its head and sees in all directions.Not even I would be able to sneak up on it, and yet this man did."Thor nodded along and looked in my direction with, if not admiration or respect then at least recognition that I might be more than a simple cook."This monster casts a net from which no prey can escape.Not even you, great Thor, could hope to leave its clutches unmarked.It hunts on the field and in the earth, and even the beasts of the air must live in constant fear of..."

While Loki was speaking, a one-armed god had walked up to Thor and leaned in to whisper something in his ear.His scowl returned.Mjlnir was in his hands faster than I could see and he slammed it into the table.A crack raced through the hardwood in my direction.Just as the crack was about to reach me, Loki nudged my seat over to the left with his foot.The table exploded in a storm of splinters that flew through the air like spears and embedded themselves in the wall behind me, just a little to the right."A SPIDER.You want us to honor a fool who died killing a spider.You mock me, Loki, for the last time."Clouds swirled around Thor and the choking darkness returned.I gasped for air, blinded and now deafened by the roar of thunder rolling towards me.Loki's voice pierced through the room."A spider.From Australia."And that's how I ended up in Valhalla.
