"You may not enter the sacred hall of warriors!"Thor boomed at me, clad in my jammies and 'Kiss the Cook' apron."Only true heroes who perished in the field of battle may join us."It was a little jarring, really.There I was, cooking breakfast, and suddenly I end up... here.I'm not sure what to make of all of this, but if this club is exclusive, I'll definitely swindle my way in."And who are you to decide what the field of battle is, Mr.Winghat?"I called out to Thor who was obviously very unhappy with this scrawny, balding man standing before him."Who's to say that the kitchen is not the most dangerous battlefield, and hunger is the most relentless enemy?What is the rule, exactly?"Thor growled, "You must be a warrior and..."

"Wrong, Thor."The eldest and most intimidating man, Odin, spoke."The rule for Valhalla is you must die wielding a weapon.Now," Odin addressed me, "do you meet this requirement to join us in everlasting glory?"What was I holding?Think man, think!I was making breakfast.Was is poptarts?Cereal?Eggs?Wait!I was making pancakes and pancakes requires... a spatula.Great."O Great and Righteous Odin, grand ruler of Valhalla, I believe I am worthy of entry."Shmoozing will definitely help my case."With what weapon?"Thor inquired, clearly tired of my antics."You were wielding a plastic flipper!A spatula!Why, you couldn't couldn't even hurt a deathly ill man!That is not a weapon."I scoff.I already know I can win this."On the contrary, Thor, I would like to argue that the spatula is a weapon of great power!"This is going to be easy.I hold the spatula aloft."Behold, the awesome might of my weapon!"Readying myself, I charge forward, lifting the cheap, plastic tool above my head.Nearing my target, I strike!FWAP

The spatula sweeps across Loki's face, who until now had just been watching the discussion with idle bemusement, leaving a clean, red mark across his slender face.His face of bewilderment was exactly what I had hoped for."As you can see, O wonderful Odin," I began, quickly receeding from Loki, "The spatula has the great power of confusion!While used on creatures of moderate size does little lasting damage, it will leave them befuddled, opening up for a strike of greater strength!Not only that, but it can crush small creatures under its wide face!"Loki, though utterly pissed, took amusement from this, heightened by Thor boiling rage."I have felt this first-hand, Father.It is a fine weapon.""Wha... bu...You..!"Thor sputtered.Odin silenced everyone with his hand."Young man, you have gall to strike my son, Loki.Your argument is compelling.Very well, you may be granted entry into Valhalla."
