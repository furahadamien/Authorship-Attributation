_thats_not_me_
The low rumble of the air conditioning clamoring to life startled me awake, and I opened my eyes to darkness.My hands dragged slowly over the thick, itchy carpet beneath me as my eyes struggled to focus onto my surroundings.Where am I?Did I fall asleep like this?In my closet?I rub my temples and slowly try to push myself up into a sitting position.As my eyes finally adjust to the lack of light, I see there is a large door in front of me, light peaking out from around the edges.Have I been kidnapped?Who would kidnap an old man?I begin rub the weariness in my eyes, and stop, surprised.My fingers begin to rub more gently, taking in the smooth texture of my eyelids.They quickly move downwards to the rest of my face, finding it to be smooth there as well.I am overcome with emotion and leap to my feet in one motion.How long has it been since I've been able to do that in less than 2 minutes?Something's wrong with me.Or right.Something is very, very right.I step to the door and drop to my knees in front of it.Holding my hands gingerly into the light streaming in through the doorway, I lose my breath.My illogical and ridiculous feeling was right; my skin no longer resembled that of an old and haggard man.These were the hands of a strapping, youthful man.A boy.A boy that had never faced the deaths of his lifelong friends, or daily aching pains, or over a decade of cancers and chemotherapy.My mind was racing so quickly from thought to thought, that I could hardly focus on any one of them enough to complete a full idea.As I stared in awe at the unaged skin pulled tightly over my hands, voices carried softly into the room with me from the other side of the door.I leaned forward and held my breath, but could not make out any words.The voices, in their muffled murmurs, sounded eerily familiar.I glanced around the room I was in and was dismayed to find that, other than the door I was crouched next to, there was nothing but blank, dark walls around me.I put my hand onto the middle of the door softly, and grit my teeth.A soft laugh of pure joy rolled out of me as I realized that the teeth I was clenching were actually my own, and not the dentures I had grown accustomed to.Slowly I pushed the door open, allowing the dim light to pour in and fill the room.On the other side of the door, I was shocked to find a movie theater room.Much larger than any I had ever seen, but the stadium seating and massive screen were unmistakable.Dozens of shadowy figures ambled around the room, laughing as they conversed.As I took in the environment, I locked eyes with a young girl of around the age of 5, across the theater from me.Her grip tightened on the hand of the adult she was holding.Her brows furrowed as she stared at me.I gulped, certain she would give away my position.Her eyebrows raised and she grinned at me.With her empty hand, she slowly waved to me.I sighed in relief and waved back to her.She had such a friendly, familiar face.She reminded me of my baby sister.The little girl turned and began to gently pull on the shirt of the woman she was holding hands with.And then she pointed in my direction, the little traitor.Realizing that the woman had not yet stopped to see what the little girl was gesturing toward, I acted quickly and crawled into the theater.I went down three rows of seating on the cold concrete floor before slowly creeping to my feet.I held my breath as I looked around me.I found the girl and sneered as she searched around the room, clearly confused about where I had snuck off to.I grinned as I remembered how easily I had snuck across the floor, and how difficult it would have been with my old and aching body.I struggled to make out any of the numerous faces or voices, when a low voice spoke from next to me."It's okay to be nervous.This is a new experience...but enjoy it."I looked down to find a young man, his head hung low.I had somehow missed him sitting in the theater chair as I crept along the floor."Who are you?Where am I?How did I get here?"I asked every question rapidly, one after another.I tried to convince myself to give him a chance to answer a single question, but my pounding heart betrayed me and a dozen more questions poured out.*"What's happening?What is this place?Who are these people?!"*  
The man chuckled, and a chill ran down my spine.His laugh triggered something very familiar in my mind.He looked up to me and my breath was gone with all of my logical thinking.I was looking into my own face.The face was mine from when I was a young man.I realized that this face must be how mine looked now, with my younger skin.I tried to speak, but my dry throat only released unintelligible croaks."Yes, you died.The cancer finally got you.Good fight, though," the man spoke quickly and almost cynically."No, this isn't heaven or hell, we *think*.No, you can't go back.Yes, I have your same face.Oh my god, how could it be?Are you me?"The man asked himself sarcastically, and then answered himself, "Yes.I am you.Does that make Buddhism right?Who knows.Who cares.When did I live?1976 until 2034.Yes, I died fairly young.Yes, i lived over a hundred years before you.Yes, crazy.Yes, the turn of the century was *insane.* Y2K, am I right?"My face must have reflected my confusion, as he rolled his eyes and continued."Whatever.You're dead, I'm dead, we're all dead in here.We all watched your life on the screen.Just like they watched mine.Just like we watch everyone's.Why?Because it's there.Who put it there?Who knows."I stood there, frozen.My thoughts had come to a screeching halt.All that was in my mind were the words, "Must be a dream.Too real to be a dream," echoing over and over, endlessly.I looked around at all the people in the room and finally understood the familiarity of the faces and voices.I looked back over to the little girl that had sold me out, and finally had a coherent thought."But--," I began but was immediately interrupted."But there are women and children here!How could there be women?I was a girl in other lives?Yeah.Obviously.And yes, it is weird to find yourself attractive as the opposite sex, so if you find yourself having weird feelings, please keep them to yourself.And if you hook up with yourself, please for the love of God, don't tell me about it.I don't care about how trippy or exciting it was.You're disgusting."I almost laughed, but lacked the required saliva and oxygen to do so."And the--," I began, but was once again interrupted."The kids?"He completed my question.He sighed."Those are shorter movies.And a lot sadder."I sat there in silence for what felt like an eternity.I looked at all of the people, seeing and hearing the similarities and differences between themselves and myself.They had different hair styles and lengths.They had different body shapes.Some were of different ethnicities.Some spoke different languages.I shook my head in disbelief as I looked at what appeared to be me, born sometime in the Paleolithicera."But there's so many," I whispered, surprised to be allowed to finish a sentence uninterrupted."28 billion people have been born on Earth *alone*.There's **bound** to be a couple cross overs."He looked up to me as I began to ask and quickly said, "No, I don't know if it has been exactly 28 billion.I'm guessing, based on the film's I've watched in here.There is no God here.Not in this damn room, at least.Everything we know...it's just our best guesses.""What am I doing here?"I asked.He chuckled."Here?You've joined the team.You're here to watch.Just like all of us."He thought for a moment."Also, we sometimes ask questions, but your life was pretty boring."I reacted, hurt, and he quickly said, "In comparison!Calm down.The one before you murdered a politician....Allegedly.Give me a break.Mine was boring, too.Minus my involvment in 9/11."The date sparked a memory from old movies I had seen based on the event."When they knocked over that building?"He rolled his eyes again, angrily."Building**s**.They blew up two buildings with planes.I was a firefighter.But we were also on the Hindenberg, so I'm still considered boring."He turned away from me and called into the room, "***Hey!*** Newbie's here.Anyone have any questions?"My blood froze in my veins as many of my own faces turned to look at me.Some with disinterest, some smiling broadly, and a few with disgust.There was an uncomfortable silence for at least half a minute."Why did you break up with that Brileen girl?She was hot!"A young teen yelled.A few voices replied with laughter, and some with groans."I...i um... Just didn't feel a spark?"I replied, trying to recall the girl I had dated over 30 years before.I received almost no reaction to my answer.There was another uncomfortable silence, and a grisly Japanese woman yelled something in what sounded like outdated Japanese.The room filled with chuckles.I stared blankly for a minute and another woman sighed before shouting, "He doesn't speak Japanese yet.She asked you if you are embarrassed for touching yourself to that video with the octopodes."My face burned with embarrassment as I realized they had seen my *entire* life.Everyone laughed once more, and went back to their conversations.I stood there for a moment, and finally my legs gave up on me, and I flopped down into a chair, two seats away from the man--the *me* that had explained it all to me.I looked up at the screen and realized it was not blank.There was some sort of swirling darkness on the screen."Some call it the in-between," the man next to me said, answering the question I hadn't yet asked."Some call it limbo.It's just what plays while we wait for the next show.""How long will that be?"I asked.
