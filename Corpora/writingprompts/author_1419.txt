Twenty they were.Strewn across the broken ashes of the world.Humans and their petty squabbles, always fighting, always stealing, always killing each other.The death counts came by the billions, and that gave me a work backlog that took near months to finish.But a thought had crossed my mind, should the last human fall, once the last soul has been dealt, what would be left for me?Nineteen they were.Another soul had to be judged, and sent to heaven.Time was ticking, I began my flight towards the survivors who were more likely to come across each other.At most there were four of them.It was near the broken ridges of Vancouver, the snowy mountains in the distance replaced with a glowing hum of radioactive residue.One by one I found each of the last humans in this city, through the last remaining shambles of sky scrapers, in the desolate and frigid streets, the subways entrances that didnt cave in, under a bridge near the deep red waters.I gave each of them the strength they needed to move, I guided them, subtly at first.Eighteen they were.But then I had to force my hand.Three men and one woman here in the once bustling city of Vancouver, and I had gathered them to one place.*

I didnt even know there were survivors, A man with a gristly expression exasperated.He almost looked like a bear with how much facial hair covered his face and body.The names Samuel. 

The others appeared reluctant to converse at first, but with the night rolling around and the nuclear winds arriving any moment now, they soon realized that at least together there was a chance of survival.I noticed a small patch of growth in the parking lot basement where the four had settled and decided to call home base.I stretched out my hand, a small plant began to grow, this will have to do for now.If they last a few more days they will find some food.Seventeen they were.I had to come back at a later date, as I visited the other remaining survivors across the world.Sixteen they were.They were too spread far apart.Fifteen they were.One more soul transported.Fourteen they were.No there had to be another cluster like the one in Vancouver.Ten they were.I felt four souls pass.I shivered, for once I was afraid of myself.I flew as fast as I could back to Vancouver.To my surprise they were still there.Samuel, and the other three, they had set up a pipe system to provide them water, they scrounged together enough gas tanks to boil the water to help cleanse it of bacteria.I took a quick glance to the patch of land I had revitalized.There was a small garden there, was it self sustaining?I should have known those four souls were all in different locations, I panicked.Nine they were.Another soul gone.I had given up on the others, really, and spent most of my time watching over the group in Vancouver.Eight they were.The last eight Humans on the world.Where ever the other four were I would be there to guide their souls.Months had passed without another death, this gave me ample time to reinvigorate the four survivors I was watching over.Much like the strength I gave the plants, soon they began to glow, and felt stronger.I believe they felt my presence as well.They had set up a small religious altar on one side of the parking lot.They, began to pray?In all my eternity as death, never has a human once praised me.I chuckled at this.Seven they were.I was confident enough in the group that I personally went to deal with this soul.Humans, I began to reminisce, power hungry, greedy, cowardly beings.But there is yet a hope for them.I looked up to the sky, I wondered how the other angels are dealing with this tragedy, and then I glanced to a pit below where a live volcano was spewing green lava.I also wondered how the devils were reveling with delight.Six they were.My wings kept flying, it was my duty, I had to help these souls pass on.Five they were.I couldnt help but feel a pang of regret, I couldnt help the others like I did the Vancouver group.It would have been too much for me to attempt to sustain all of them across the world.Four they were.This was it.With that I began to fly to where the last human had died.It was at Vancouver.I my bones shivered.I ducked my head down, pulled up my dark cloak and spread my dark wings wide.I flew to Vancouver as fast as I could.The scene was bittersweet, one of them had stabbed the other.I sat there on top of a car watching their squabble.The woman was clutching her stomach, crying.The other two men were still at each others throats.The one lying dead in the background was Samuel.Perhaps there was no hope.I sighed.Was there anymore that I could have done?Three they were.I jolted up, I looked towards the three survivors in front of me, and they were all lying in their cots.Fast asleep.It was a soul somewhere in the alps.It would have to find heaven or hell on its own.I was not leaving this spot.For the following months, I could feel the brooding tension between the last three survivors, they had food, they had water, and they had shelter.Yet the bickered, they were the last humans on the world, but they acted like immature children, not realizing how dire their situation was.At this point I had made the point of learning their names.The woman was named Eve.I half hesitated at the irony.The two men were named Liam and Thomas.Eve, are you awake? Thomas nudged Eves shoulder.Eve. He whispered again.Th-thomas? She asked, still half asleep.And then I watched the magic happen.Maybe they were learning after all, or perhaps this was just a lust driven action in a situation where death was a sweet, sweet aphrodisiac.And soon enough, Four they were.As eve gave birth to the first human in this post-apocalyptic world.But I kept watching over them.As long as it took, by my hand, I will not run out of work.
