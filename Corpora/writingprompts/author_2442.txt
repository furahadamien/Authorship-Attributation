"YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THIS!"yelled Speedster, balancing himself on one knee as his other leg has a metal rod jammed into it."You've killed so many innocent lives today!I... may be injured...But I will not give up!I CANNOT... give...up..!"Speedster was struggling to stand up as I spaced out to remember what had just happened earlier.It was a normal day for me, yet a terrible, i suppose, day for the citizens.In Saffty City, people with super powers tend to become heroes to fight against crime, while others-

"I... Can almost stand..." 

Oh right.Speedster.Forgot about him for a moment there.His powers was basically super speed, provided his legs were undamaged, hence the metal rod.It wasn't hard to achieve that injury."Once I stand up... You'll pay for what you have done to those people!"Oh right.To explain that, I basically wanted to lure out Cataclysm, self-proclaimed strongest hero in the world, constantly saving lives and fighting against the "forces of evil".I'd gathered that he's the real inspiration for these lesser heroes thinking they have a chance to become just like him.So what I had done was plant explosives in some of the schools and government buildings and detonated them, killing many people.Unfortunately, I was too nervous to completely announce myself and only Speedster was able to find me after I left hidden messages/riddles throughout the internet on who I am and where I was.A fight did ensue and at first I was outclassed due to Speedster's speed, however, as expected, he became full of himself and began gloating on how "I was going to pay for what I had done and how he's the best hero from his school," and so on and so forth.Being able to distort space in a fixed location is really useful when it needs to be.Hmm?Oh right.The monologue.Speedster was finally able to stand up on both feet."Even if... You somehow defeat me, I'll come back.An injury like this will not keep me down for long.I have recuperated from worst, and will do so again, for as long as I AM STILL BREATHING, A MAN LIKE YOU WILL NEVER DEFEAT A HERO!You've stolen many lives today, you terrorist.But you won't take anymore!My name is Speedster!I am the fastest man on the planet!"I distorted the space around Speedster's neck to decapitate his head as he poised himself to sprint towards me.I still wonder why I let heroes monologue their little nonsense at me whenever I put them into this situation.I've let it happen from eight heroes already.Regardless, might as well plan the next event.I know Cataclysm should have caught wind of me as well, so I should definitely plan for his execution.Could possibly make it public...
