Ever since the accident, I've been having headaches.They said it wouldn't last forever, but it's been over two years and lately they've been getting worse.I stopped fighting it a long time ago.In a way it's comforting, the physical pain helps dull the memory of losing her.To be honest, I can't remember much from before the accident, but I could never forget Ashley.She was everything to me.We had been married for five years and were trying to start a family but it just wasn't in the cards.It was my fault.Something called Klinefelter syndrome.It was hard but we had been through so much, shared everything together, right up until the end.That was my fault too.I didn't see the light change.When I woke up they told me I was lucky to be alive.Funny thing is, I don't feel lucky.I groan and pop a few painkillers as I roll out of bed.Don't think about her, Joe.You have important work to do. I'm an analyst for a classified government project codenamed Clean Slate.We hunt down dangerous criminals and use a metahuman named Rehab to wipe their memories so they can be reintroduced to society.My job is to think like them, to get in their heads and assess the likelihood that reintroduction will be successful.Not everyone can be saved.There is an unfortunate side effect.The only way for the project to work is if everyone who knows them has their mind wiped too, a clean slate.The project is kept a secret because they don't think the world will understand.But I understand.I would give anything to forget the things I've done, for just one day without the pain, without the guilt.Everyone deserves a second chance.I pour some coffee and boot up my PC to get started.Working from home is one of the perks of a top secret project.Our latest target is a particularly elusive assassin that we've nicknamed the Queen.She seems to turn up all over the world and always leaves the same calling

The five words in my inbox catch my attention: Your life is a lie. As I click through the articles, I don't want to believe what I'm seeing.I don't want to believe it, but I can't help thinking it makes a lot of sense.I see my own face, attached to a wanted poster for a notorious cyber thief who stole billions from other criminals and major corporations.Wasn't it my skills in bypassing cyber security that helped me get this job in the first place?How many times have I been tempted to keep the money for myself before thinking that's not what she would have wanted?The message was anonymous and untraceable, even for me.This isn't just a joke, someone knows what they're doing.I want to ignore it but the evidence is overwhelming.It certainly would explain the headaches and memory loss.I never wanted to know what happens after.It's the last link, simply titled Lotus, that makes my blood run cold.Inside is a birth certificate for a girl named Marissa, my daughter.A video starts to play.A young woman is staring out a window.She doesn't talk, barely even blinks.Her room is covered in drawings of lotus flowers and two doctors are discussing her condition.We've been calling her Lotus.We don't know her real name and she hasn't responded to anything we've tried.She doesn't seem to recognize anything we show her, as if she isn't storing memories.

The tears are hot as they roll down my face, boiling with pain and rage.Getting into his house was easy, there's no need for security when nobody remembers what you've done to them.He didn't even deny it.When I said the word Lotus his whole body sunk in shame.All he could say was it wasn't supposed to happen, he's regretted every day since.I heard enough.That's when I knew everything we had been doing was horribly wrong.Pulling the trigger is nothing like the movies.When I dropped the flower at his feet I felt nothing.No relief, no regret.Just a cold emptiness and the feeling that anything inside of me that ever mattered was gone.When I got back to my apartment I knew something was different.My computer was on and the Lotus file was open but it wasn't the same.There was no birth certificate, no reference to me, even the girl in the picture was different from the one I saw in the video.That's when I saw the empty pill bottle by the keyboard and felt my lungs start to tighten.The room started spinning and I saw her standing over me as I fell to the floor: the woman who was supposed to be my daughter.I felt her close my hand around something cold as she whispered in my ear, you played the pawn well. By the time I realized I had been played I didn't care.I let go, the queen rolling to the floor as I welcomed the darkness.
