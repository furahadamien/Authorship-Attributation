Ahmed sat in the chair in his apartment, counting down.One of the very few articles of furniture that he had at all, he sat on a simple wooden chair, situated right in the middle of the small, small room."30...29...28...27..." 

*pum pum pum pum* 

The sounds of gunshots outside produced no sounds but complete discord, following with the unsteady cracking sounds of the concrete apartment building.He could've ran away, but he knew that was just delaying the inevitable.He thought it was better than the hell he's been going through constantly running away for the past few days.So he returned.Ahmed returned to the place he knew best.In the throes of revolution, radical groups surrounded the apartment building.He remembered those couple minutes in such details as if they were hours.The combination of the American helicopter blades throwing up dust in every direction for what seemed like an endless radius, and the tears filling his eyes and rolling down his cheek tasted awful, and made it almost impossible to see.The sound of the soldier yelling that they can't fit everybody was almost masked by the loud whirring beats of the blades.Holding up his six year old son with the determination of what made him feel like a skyscraper, he was screaming what wasn't even words.The greatest feeling of all was when that weight was taken off his arms."19...18...17..." 

He remembered the time before that happened.His constant attention was on his little boy.No matter what was happening in his country he wanted to make sure that nothing would get in the way of his little boy having a good life.He would take him out for walks.He would play catch with him.He would walk in the extremely small street markets to get food, his son on his shoulders.He taught him how to read and write, even when his son protested.Every day when they walked back home from anywhere, he would show his son the beautiful white jasmine."14...13...12..." 

The room crackled.He remembered the feeling when his son caught the ball for the first time."11...10...9..." 

The room started rocking back and forward.He remembered his son laughing maniacally on his shoulders."8...7...6..."

He remembered the smell of the jasmine.It always smelled better when he was with his son."5...4..." 

He picked up the mug on the table to the right.Through tears, he read what was crudely written in marker, written for him three years ago." #1"

"3...2..." 

He remembered the smell of the jasmine.It always smelled better when he was with his son.
