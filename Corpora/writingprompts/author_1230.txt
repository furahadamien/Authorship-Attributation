I'm just ready to go home.Christmas has already been a mess.What a shitty time for a grandparent to die.Most people expect me to be a grieving mess but he was old, he was ready to go, and he was mostly a part of my childhood.I was sad to see him go, but a big reaction never arose in me.We could have been home, we could have had a normal Christmas Eve, and a normal Christmas morning but we just had to stay one more god damn day.I guess I'm being selfish, my grandmother needed some support, but I'm skeptical we really helped all that much.Probably not worth sacrificing Christmas.Now all I have to look forward to this Christmas is a twelve hour drive home.A long ass drive ahead of us and we're sitting here chatting away.We've already had four days of chatting, do we really need a few more hours?I'll just do what I've done every day; check Reddit.A writing prompt?I never really like these."You are yourself on Christmas Day, reading this on reddit, you are told that you are loved an accepted for who you are, and to have a happy holiday season, and a great new year!"Hah, that's kinda funny.I guess I needed that.Why am I wasting my time pouting?Maybe it's not the Christmas I'm used to, but I'm still surrounded by family.I spread some cheer, had some fun with family members I don't see too often, and I didn't really miss out on much.Christmas is Christmas no matter where you are.Have a merry Christmas everyone!
