No reason to panic.This is normal.It was just a dream.I am not going to die.No reason to panic.This is normal...

Over and over she repeated the words in her head while lying awake at 3am in the morning.What had sent her into panic and prevented her from sleeping even though she very much had to be at work the next day was that, while she was just going to get a glass of water, she just heard somebody calling her name.She was alone in the apartment, but she knew the story.Her grandma had told her about it.Her dead husband calling her name at night when it was really quiet and only she could hear it.She would always laugh and say it was him from the other side, calling because her family wanted to be reunited with her.Then she died.Cardiac arrest, one day she just fell over and was gone.But as much as Anna liked the idea of her grandma coming to peace with her ending life, she was **not** ready to be reunited with her dead relatives yet.She had just moved here, found a new job, started dating... in other words, her life was just about to start.Anna!Anna!, there it was again.She was trying to breathe, calm herself down, but it felt like her heart was going to jump right out of her chest.Anna you can't....  suddenly there was darkness, and she had the strangest feeling of being lifted out of her body.Then there was light.Too much light.She had to squint and cover her eyes.She heard voices.Her mother?Her dad?And even... grandma?I said you can't play all day.It's time to eat., her mother said, and then, directed to the kitchen: I knew these VR goggles were a bad idea mom!.Anna looked around.This was the living room she grew up in, in her parents house.She could hear her parents argue in the kitchen and her grandma telling them to stop fighting.Everything was just as she remembered it, everything besides her body, that was not the body of a grown woman anymore, but that of a ten year old child, grasping a VR headset and trying to make sense of what just happened.
