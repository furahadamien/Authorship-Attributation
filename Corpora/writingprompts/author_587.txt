I remember the day that I found out who I was.I had thought that I was Curtis Clark, a 37 year-old pediatric dentist in San Antonio.And, for a time, that is who I was.I had also had memories of a time before that: memories of growing up, of having friends in high school, of struggling to get my degree and opening my practice, of a few forgotten flings I had along the way.It seemed like nothing out of the ordinary, I thought I had been nothing out of the ordinary.But I had been wrong.I remember one day a little girl--7, I think--came in.She had lost quite a few teeth for her age already, and thinking that this was a sign of growing up, I had had the gall to congratulate her.But this only put tears in her eyes.I asked her what was wrong, and she told me how she had lost some of her teeth.I cant say that I was really all that said for her, though.That wasnt the primary emotion that I felt.Instead, it was anger.I was angry at her parents, at her father, so angry, everything began to take on a tinge of crimson.It took so much patience to finish working on her, and when the mom came in, to avoid stabbing the her with dental tools as punishment for standing by while this had happened to her daughter.I thought back, and I couldnt ever remember being that angry, yet I had felt, for some reason, that the feeling was familiar.I remember taking the rest of the day off, and calling CPS.But from what the agent said, and some intuition that I had not known about until then, I had no illusions that they would take any timely action to save that little girl.If only one of the superheroes would take an interest in such things, but they seem only to care about Big Name Villains--never heard of one who goes after petty criminals and domestic disputes.I then spent the rest of the day wondering about myself.I thought about this angry side that I had just found within myself.It didnt seem like that was something that I had ever experienced with myself.Yet, it had felt so natural.I remember thinking things at that time, that from that point onwards, I could not get out of my head.Thoughts of rage and fury, and some sort of knowledge of how to execute them.Plans to incinerate government buildings filled with inept pension-hungry drones found their way into my head.Thoughts on suffocating and choking greedy and heartless executives in their cushy offices with toxic gas.Plans to protect myself, my thoughts, from...something.I remember the day that I found out who I was.I was reading the online paper.The frontpage story was about Captain Stupendous, the superhero.He had apparently eradicated his 100th villain--though, because of the way he did his work, no one actually remembered them all.How long had he been active, something approaching 20 years, and he only manages 100 villains?I could find that many in a week, I thought.I was wondering just how it was that these 100 were so *important*, so *heinous*, as to merit his personal attention, and thus I looked back on the past articles the newspaper had.He seemed to only average about one feat every 2 months.I remember the exact moment that I saw...me.Most papers blurred out the faces of villains--at Stupendouss request, so that he could actually try giving them a new shot at life or whatever his thing was.Wiping their memories had seemed inhuman to me at the time, and dishonest, but he was of the line of thought that it was preferable to killing them, and that they would do better next time.There were, though, some tabloids that tried to skirt this with less than complete obfuscation, and it is in one of those that I saw what I suddenly recognized to be...me.The figure in the article, unlike many other villains, had refrained from being grandiose, and had only called himself Dr. C. No stupid made-up stage name, no Doctor Doom or High Lord of Paine--and no wearing weird suits like the latter either.They had to make up the name Dr. Cruel for him, but he never acknowledged it.The article called him the most terrifying, because he struck without first gloating, without giving explanation, and without mercy.It resonated with every fiber of my being, and in that moment, I felt whole, complete, and completely dedicated to a new calling--or rather, rededicated to an old one.I remember Dr. C. I am Dr. C. I am an oncologist for society, for it has been stricken with a cancer that I must eliminate.The so-called heros do not care for the calls of the everyday villains of the world, they do not care for the real villains of the world, only their flamboyant stage partners.That burden falls to me, and I remember now how to embrace it.I remember the righteous fire that drove me.I look back at my patient records.That father lives in a suburb a few miles away.He feels the need to hurt his daughter when he feels the burn of alcohol down his throat.I wonder if he will feel the same if he feels real fire.If I remember correctly, most dont.And now, now I do remember.
