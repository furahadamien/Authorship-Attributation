As the sun is slowly entering the room and Jordan is still in the bed.He feels the sun warming up his body.He decides that he would go out of bed when the first sunrays reach his face.On the bedside table, the clock does not seem to think the same.BIP-BIP-BIP-BIP A ragefully fist stops this so annoying sound.Jordan grumbles.Why have I chosen this noisy clock?he says for himself.Usually, when you are alone, nobody replies to this kind of thought.For Jordan, its not the same.Because you are just a lazy bitch whom cannot wakes up alone.He hates that voice, it is always here, in his head.Hi there, nice to see you are still here  Jordan stretches his arms and puts his slippers on.Always at your service lazy king.Ive done what you asked me  It must be one of his newest joke.And why did I ask you?ask Jordan still sleepy.He walks toward the bath room but the voice stops him.FREEZE.You first go to your desk.No, first, I clean myself up.You need to revise your sense of priority   Nyanyanya, stupid coward.I have no body how can I think about cleaning myself up?I dont know and maybe I dont care  Jordan takes his shower and goes very slowly, just for bothering the rude voice.But it knows how to respond and sings Never gonna give you up from Rick Astley during all the shower time.Now, Jordan is going to have it all day through his head.Now, look at the desk .He knows how much this silly voice can be annoying if it wants to.He walks toward his desk and finds an envelope with his names written on it.See, I draw a basketball in the O. Its a joke for Michael Jordan  Jordan hates that joke since he is tiny, no more than 1m60, white as the snow and not sportive at all.He used to cry when he this joke was done in middle school.The voice knows it but now it is not what Jordan thinks of.In the envelope are two bills of twenty dollars.How have you done that?A wizard never tells his tricks.That is fucking creepy.Im happy you like it, puny Jordan.You ask for a rent, here it is, I can now legally stay with you.Jordan has no words.How can the voice do that, it is only in his head.You know Jordan, I like you.Maybe you are tiny, weak and ugly but Im sure you are a reliable person.HOW HAVE YOU DONE THAT?The scream of Jordan was powerful.Eheh, I told you.I have my secret.So now, the problem is just getting bigger.The voice is rude and annoying but it can now act on the real world, the palpable world.Jordan is a clever boy and he knows the voice since he is not more than a kid.It will never tell how it has done that but Jordan can reverse the situation.It is not what I was thinking of when I was talking about a rent.Oh yeah?What were you thinking of?The voice is intrigue by the sudden calm in Jordan voice.You can use my body if you do what I tell you.And what do you want to tell me?The voice is more and more interested in Jordans speech.Do you want to be an actor?You dont even know if I am a boy or a girl.Do you want to be an actress so?No, its okay, I want to be an actor.Good, I give you one lesson of acting per day and you can have my body for a day per week.It is a pretty risky bet but Jordan thinks it is worthless.What do you know about acting?You barely remember your credit card code.It is a fact and another point which makes Jordan angry when the voice talks about it, and the voice knows it.It is not the time for feelings, it is the time for strategy.Do you want to use my body, yes or no?The voice is pretty interested in the bargain.What do I need to learn in these acting class, teacher?That was sarcastic.First of all, you must respect your teacher.Ok, teacher.So, what am I learning, teacher?Jordan will never get rid of that mean intonation, the voice is too stubborn.You need to act like if you were me.AHAHAHAH, if i cannot be myself, what is the point of getting your body?Ok so no body for you.A silence.A long silence barely believable in Jordans world.Fuck you, just fuck you.You and your miserable corpse, you think I am nothing because I have no physical incarnation?And how did I put the envelope?You dont know that, no?You treat me like I am just your imagination but guess what I am real!AHAHHAHA  As the laugh of the voice is getting more and more insane, the pillow in the bed explodes.The feathers are slowly falling in the room.It is white as the snow.SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ABOUT THIS JORDAN!?I CAN DO WHAT I WANT!These words reverb in the head of Jordan and his favorite mug explodes in the kitchen.Jordan begin to be afraid, really afraid.Before, the voice was only inside of him, now it can change the world around his body.It is not the time for fear.The floor makes weird noise.You now I always believe you were real.Its why Im ok to share my body.The intonation of Jordan is less confident than before but he feels the anger of the voice slowly reducing.When you will have my body, you will be just completely real!It was a bad move.You think I need a body for being real?YOU THINK I AM NOT A PERSON?As a proof of what it said, a long crack just appeared on the bathrooms mirror.Jordan starts to panic and takes three steps backwards.His body is warming near the window but it is not the time to think about it.SEE WHAT I CAN DO!The voice is getting louder in Jordans head, it is merely unbearable.He feels like his head is going to explode like the mug before.The floor is cracking more and more.Toc-toc-toc.Someone is knocking by the door.Hi.Are you okay?I live next door, I heard some trouble.OK Jordan, try to make up my own existence.Try to hide me!The voice is loud but it was not a scream.Its okay thank you.Im just not really awake, i broke my mug.Oh fine, tell me if you need something.Yeah thank you.The voice mimics him  Its okay thank you.AND THAT IS OKAY?That reverb again, but this time it comes with a large cut on his hand.He starts to bleed.Jordan looks at the cut.He is speechless.OH AND I CAN DO THAT TOO!So deep, so loud!Jordan feels a big pain in his belly, like a punch.The pain makes him step forward.The neighbor comes back and knocks harder.Are you sure it is okay, i am getting worried about you!Do you want me to call the 911?Jordan cannot reply to her.He is too concerned about his hand.The wooden planks on the flour crack louder and louder.YOU SUFFER, DONT YOU?The rasping breath of Jordan is getting faster.OK, I CALL THE 911  The neighbors scream adds to the cacophony in Jordans head.Jordan is lost.The only truth he knows at this moment is the voice hurting him.AND THAT!AND THAT!AND THAT!One punch more, and another, and another, and a fourth one.One step, two steps, three steps and a final one.He fells.The broken apartment window is quickly moving away.An emotionless sound of the body was the last thing that Jordan heard.The final note of the cacophony.Marianne was shocked.She is in this building for two days.Only two days.As the police is questioning her, she cries.I dont know I heard some screams and some object being broke.The kid was not responding so I call 911  The rest of the sentence is covered by her sniffing and tears.A policeman approaches the one with Marianne.It is ok Madame.We know what we want.They left Marianne with a doctor and walks toward the dead corpse.What do we have?It is a student called Jordan.He lives on the fourth floor.The inside of his apartment is a complete mess.Broken glass everywhere, coffee on the wall and an old floor cracking with every step.No sign of intrusion nor fight.He must have gone insane, throw his mug and punch his mirror.That explains the deep cut on his hand.It can be the broken window too, I dont know.They stop and look at the scene.A suicide.The second policemans eyes are full of melancholy.An ugly thing at this age.
