First stops the rain.It begins with the rain, the wind, the movement of the celestial bodies, those distant signal fires.Then the sounds.Now quiet are the footsteps of strangers and the roaring of waterfalls alike.It is not still yet, but it is quiet.It is a respite before the true work begins, for it only lasts for the blink of an eye before all else comes to a halt.Not like the stopping of a body in motion, but of an immediate lifelessness - the switching off of a lamp in the deepest of night.And then the work begins.There is the Hunter, unseen, mute, but with power unimaginable.It is the power to stop the world itself, to cease the descent of the waters of time through the cracks of futures unseen.And the Hunter does speak, but only I can listen, for I am the Blade.I do not pass judgement, you must know.The Blade only exacts the will.I would not have chosen it.It chose me.It poisons me.I have become it: a thin scrap of wire, a bullet fired, a razor's edge, a thick metal bar.My face is ghastly white, my hands are stained with nearly three-hundred.I do not sleep, I do not wish, I am one with the timeless hate of the Hunter.A patch of grass ripples in silence.It is a clue to the path I must follow."Fiat voluntas tua, swift and silent."I begin to run, my breath exhaled in the cold spring air stops like little clouds.The grass ripples, a can rolls, the water churns against the river's edge.I follow, sprinting after as the world awakens in a thin line towards the next (pray it be the last) who has been judged.I climb, I leap, I follow the trail unfurled before me, arriving at an alley, dark, muddy, and reeking of piss and destitution.A handsome man in his thirties holds a phone to his head.His fingers begin to come to life."What, what the hell?"He looks about - that same look of wild confusion they all get, like a rat dropped suddenly to a quaking mass of serpents.And I make my presence known, drawing a heavy length of iron from besides a dumpster."Two rivers diverge through the wasteland of time.Choose left or right," I shout, my voice hardly concealing excitement."What?"mutters the rat."Choose left or right.""Uh, left?"I swing the iron, which collides solidly with his body, now frozen again.I watch as he is divided, on version illuminated in the pale teal light, the other increasingly battered.The Hunter takes the light and the Blade leaves - I leave - I disappear to the dark cocoon which I will once again spring forth, at the bidding, when the world stops once more.
