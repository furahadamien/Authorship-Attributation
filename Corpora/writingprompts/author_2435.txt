Surprised 

That's what their last thought was.They were surprised at what I had done.Before I came, the heroes and villains had  epic fights.Walls broke as bodies flew into them.Cries of pain echoed the city as the mad villain tortured the brave hero.The triumph look of the hero's face as he broke free and saved the city.But now?When I'm here?It is a much more, quick, fight.I walk with the crowd, all rushing to meet Captain Amazing.The excited chatter of one thousand men, women and children echo across the buildings and back towards me.I hear the gushing of teenage girls, hoping that he would pick them up in his arms and fly away in them.I see little children pulling their parents arm, hoping that it will make them see him faster.As the crowd streams towards the city square, where he will make his grand appearance on the lush green grass, I instead duck into a slim, barely noticeable dark alley.I grab the hidden duffel bag I had packed the night before and check its contents.One disassembled CheyTac Intervention, 10 rounds of .408 Chey Tac ammunition filled into one clip.I would only need one bullet, the rest is insurance in case his friends decide to make a visit.I climb on top of the old, green dumpster and jump towards the stairwell.The old, rusty metal creaks as it takes my body and I start walking up the metal staircase.I assemble the well kept sniper and load a bullet into its chamber.I wait for his grand appearance.1 minute passes, it then turns into 2, then, 5 then at the 10 minute mark, the is a deafening sound as the sound barrier breaks and he lands on the ground.\_drama queen\_ I thought as I aimed down the scope.I see him raise his right hand and begin a long monologue about law and justice."Very ironic coming from a vigilante," I said to no one.I adjust my scope slightly and begin slowing down my breathing.Like I had practised thousands of times, I waited for my heart beat to go past, and I pulled the trigger.Captain Amazing fell to the floor.It is a bit hard to stand when your brain has imploded.No one can't believe what has happened.The world is silent as they accept the hard truth and begin shouting and crying.The time of egoistic villains has come and gone.The time of epic fights billing millions of dollars has come and gone.The time of idealistic heroes has come and gone.The time of proper villains had begun.&#x200B;
