Death, hands of human
I have seen thousands and hundreds life dripping away in my hand.There are tears, happiness, and regrets at humans life ending point.Now I am dying at the hands of human survivors.My regret, my tears, seem blank as no feelings in my heart
Shadowing behind them, seeing lives of post-apocaliptic, struggling but loving, My heart had a touch.I helped them out of my selfishness , but learned how to love and care 
My fate is indeed at the hand of humans
Because I am no longer Death but Life.
