Neville Longbottom sat alone at a bar.Beer had run down his chin and his good shirt was stained.He had done this every time this dreadful date came around for the last ten years.Harry was supposed to come back but he never did.No McGuffin or Deus Ex Machina.Just death.Neville was among the last to give up hope that night.After Harry died it went from a fight to massacre.Some how he had lived and managed to get a number of the younger students to safety.Or so he thought.It had turned out that most of them were hunted down anyway.Even Luna was lost in the chaos.Now he sat a pathetic drunken hulk in some mid western bar that no body ever heard of.Just then he heard the door open behind him.A beautiful girl came up and sat next to him.He noticed the tattoo on her arm as she said "hello" in a Manchester accent.Neville immediately sobered a little and said "what do you want" she smiled and said flirtatiously "I was there night, in that group of students you saved, I wanted to see what became of our so called saviour."At this Neville snorted and said "that man died that night, so cut the shit and be out with it."Her smile faded and she got more serious."After that night they came for me, like everyone else.My parents were good upstanding middle class people.They had no idea about things like running and fighting.Thus they found us, and well.They did unspeakable things to me."Neville interrupted "why are you telling me this?"Her looked changed to that look that a woman oft has when she wants a man's aid.She started "simple, I want revenge."Neville was interested and said "alright go on" she looked at a man in the back of the bar and the said "not here, but I know a place."Neville noted how the man tapped his leg.She took him to her car and Neville muttered two incantations to himself, one was to sober up.As they drove more into the middle of nowhere she explained " the dark lord held me for years.Had his death eaters use me as a sex toy, even made me get that wretched mark.Now I want my revenge and I think we can kill him if we work together."Neville just chuckled at that, and said "there are fates worse then death.Especially for him" 

They pulled into an old and abandoned looking house.Neville sensed it immediately and before she even had the keys out of the ignition Neville yelled "stupify".She slumped into the driver seat.Neville walked away into the house."Crucio, Crucio, Crucio!"Three green flashes erupted with three cries of agony.Then "incendio!"And old house was licked with flames as Neville walked calmly back to the car drove off.Some hours later, after the sun had risen Neville sat on the back of the car with the trunk open on an abandoned road.As he waited for her to wake he puffed a cigar and read her ID.Slyvia Pearson it read, and he knew the face from all those years ago."She looked more Innocent then" he thought.Then she finally stirred and woke up.Bound and gagged she tried thrash and scream and but she was bound well.Neville looked her in the eye and said "you thought me a fool.Lady I've been dodging death eaters like you for 10 years.You don't live 10 years on the run being a fool."He paused and took a puff then started again, "and make no mistake, you are a death eater and you will help me kill Voldemort."He then slammed the trunk and took out an old faded letter with the stamp of the Prime Minister's office and dialed a number.A pretty young answered "Good day" and Neville said "  a bit cold I think."
