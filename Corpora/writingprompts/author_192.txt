"Oh, here *they* come" the blonde agent said, his English having a slight accent.Scandinavian, probably.His face was hidden behind a generic Guy Fawkes mask.White shirt, black tie, black suit, black shoes, black gloves, electronic watch.The other agent turned her head to see.A woman with a big black sunhat and a bland white mask.Black suit, black boots, black gloves, electronic watch.She didn't say anything.From everywhere, ninjas appear, in various ninja gear, armed with Howa type 89s and fuckin' samurai swords, they literally started firing at the convention of literal assassins, again.No message, just screaming at you from the start.Every few years they track down a gathering, and just charge it.Not even any demands, no envoy - they're never invited anyway.Almost everyone at the convention, as if they had been waiting for the moment, snapped into action.Pistols slid out from sleeves, boots and pants all over.Bartenders dove behind the bar, and started throwing assault rifles to the agents.A few odd ones were completely caught off guard, and started freaking out."Holy shit" an American agent, probably Texan, shouted.Probably his first time.He hadn't reached for cover because of this, and got shot in the jugular, forehead and abdomen.The ninjas, however, had even less who had survived to learn.The agents had taken up defensive positions, and quickly gained superior fire control.The ninjas had come sliding in from ropes as well, and as they got shot they fell, slamming into the floor.Others had made it down, trying to get a foothold by swamping them with dead ninjas falling from the sky, executing agents point blank and slashing them with samurai swords.As usual, after a few volleys, most of them had been neutralised.Some had fallen wounded, but killed themselves where capable instead of risking capture.Some carried grenades.And as usual, once most of them were downed ... All over the place, they'd explode themselves as they screamed in defiance.Body parts, blood, concrete, shrapnell flew around.Meanwhile above, a security team had engaged the second wave of ninjas, not succeeding in preventing them from throwing nades down to the lowest floor.By now, the quickest had made it into the other rooms, where they engaged parts of the second wave.In all this, the Scandinavian agent, sat almost paralysed behind the bar, clenching his Glock 17, trying to cover his ears.He was surrounded by dead bartenders, as the rest had now fled, as the ground shook and dust flew around."Frlt mig, Herre" he heaved through his tears, rocking around, his shoulder bleeding heavily.The agent with the bland white mask had lost her black sunhat by now, revealing her dark brown hair and fair complexion."Upp, upp lilla tik" she screamed as she dragged at his arm "Jvla skitt" as a nade blew half the bar away."Upp!""Jag r knullad, de har skjutit mig" he groaned 

"Jag r inte jvla blind, tjockskalle, g upp om du inte vill att vi ska d, jvla" she screamed right into his face.That got him up, and they stumbled over the bodies into the other room.I push the button now that only ninjas remain, and gas starts filling the room,  killing them as their circulatory system feels as if its on fire, and their lungs shut down.That's another generation of ninjas we won't have to deal with, I think as I push back against my desk, so I can see the vast myriad of security cameras.Ninja raids gave him a great commission.
