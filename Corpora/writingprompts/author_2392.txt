They call hereabouts the Cape Graveyard, a city where superheroes and villians alike go to try, and to die.It's a really ordinary kind of place where anyone tries to do anything really big, they don't last long.It's a nice play on Cape Grave, the real name of this pleasant, ordinary town.Me?I don't have a hero name, or a villain name, but they called me "Jinx" in school.We didn't have school shootings, but the guy with a rifle coming for revenge tripped and blew his own brains out when it hit the ground and discharged.The Twilight Bomber somehow managed to implode himself after taking a class full of third-graders hostage, me included.Too bad about Containment Lass, though.It was a really great entry through the window to save us until she tripped over a desk and got a pencil through the eye.Tragic.Me, that third grader?When they died, I never felt better, like I'd managed to find my purpose in life without even knowing it, that something about the world was always going to be going my way.I took up a hobby every kid does in the age of supers- superwatching.Remember that freak cascading failure in the Flying Brick's armored suit that sent him face first into a kiddie pool and he drowned in front of thousands on cam?I sure do.I was watching.Stupor being electrocuted by a live wire in the middle of the night while hanging out on a roof?I was on the roof across the street, having a bite at the Skytop Diner as he was about to swoop in on a bank robbery.It's not my fault he grabbed the wire instead of the grapnel line.Anacord tearing that car in half, only to be showered with it's cargo of metanarcotics and ODing on the spot?I was in the car that blocked it off just enough from getting through on the bridge exit.Made it an easy grab for his kill shot on Crystal Method.Method should have checked his sound system before playing that victory song, though.Instant sinkhole and landing on top of that gas main?Charcoal.Famous supers inevitably end up swooping in to save the day, and if I'm watching?It's the last swoop.Supervillians always getting on camera, monologue about how they're going to take over the world?You know how badly that's gone the last dozen times, every death a freak accident of superscience or magic gone wrong when it isn't some pathetic end.I'm fond of Destrominator's minion tipping over that cup of water on a console just as he pushed the Domination Ray's trigger, causing it to backfire and burn out all of his higher brain functions.I'm even more fond of the last gasp it gave that turned Savior's noggin into tapioca pudding when he turned the camera around to tell the world they'd been saved.I'm almost sixty-eight now, but I look like a thirty-year old in her prime.The docs say I'm lucky, must be a metagene.I don't know where I get all the luck.Has to be coming from somewhere.Or someone.Six hundred, seventy-six someones so far.And you?You decided you're going to stop me.I have no idea what went wrong, but that jet-assisted boost into low orbit was very impressive, if totally unplanned.Without life support.Six hundred, seventy-seven.
