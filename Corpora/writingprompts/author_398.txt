"I'm sorry sir, but this ID is fake.""Who the hell do you think you are boy?If you had any idea who I-"

"Sir, I"m going to have to ask you to present me with some real proof of identity.You are not 24.""What the hell do you know you insolent prick, this ID is more real than anything you will contribute to this society over the course of your lifetime."I sighed.I'd considered not confronting him, letting him pass, but his demeanour was pissing me off."You're outside our age range for the night.We admit individuals aged 21 to 30 here.You sir seem to have missed that cut off range by about two thousand years."He paled, then turned red.Began to turn, turned back, stumbled in his indecisiveness and would have fallen if not for the press of bodies all vying for my attention."Don't tell me they give you *optorithmen* for working as bouncer now?"Obviously deciding it wasn't worth waiting for an answer he began pushing his way back through the crowd, and then down the street into the inky night.Historians I find, despite their age, really are idiots.I shook my head and returned to checking IDs.It was never any trouble, after the enclave's gift.Scanning the plastic cards was more of a formality, and a safety procedure, than a necessity.If I turned people away at a glance those who aren't aware would get suspicious.The night wore on, and I did my job damn well if I do say so myself.I stepped aside for a break at 11:58.I like to watch the numbers change from 11 to 12 at midnight.As the 31st became the first, I sighed.One more month till one more year left of my contract.Then what.Maybe I should become a historian myself.It could be pretty interesting, but 10,000 years of service for an 11,000 year life extension seemed like a bit of a crap deal.Our historians, like normal dentists, had a disproportionally high suicide rate - that definitely says something.Just because you *can* live for ever doesn't really mean you *should* live for ever.It's not for everybody.Still there are other cool gifts with lower prices that I'd been thinking about.The enclave will grant you your gift, in exchange for service, and some gifts cost more than others.Usually these gifts allow us to serve above and beyond the normal line of duty, helping Them whenever They needed it.Not every club has people like me working the door, but for high class establishments like mine, normal security doesn't usually cut it.I hear the security are granted *musculi* here, but I've never actually seen them have to use it.Rumour is that big business goes on in the VIP section here, but in all honesty, I'd never seen any proof.I almost agreed with the angry old man.*Optorithmen* was totally overkill for a bouncer job, but who am I to argue with a gift for a job I'd propably do anyway.I figure I'll end up accruing as many as I can, doing odd jobs till I feel they want to get on with me life - plus my additions.A lot of people work till they're given a job too unpalatable to do and then they draw they line.So far I've only had easy work - club admission included.And of course the enclave gives us our years back.I've been working the door here for just under nine now, and when I'm done I expect be given my ten back ASAP.I rejoin the other bouncers, my break is over.I wonder how many of then can see ages like I can.Technically I'm not allowed to ask.I could lose my job and my abilities if I reveal the enclave's gifts to anybody ordinary.You never know who's working right beside you.I haven't seen any of them around the enclave but that doesn't mean anything.It's big enough that two people might not meet in over a thousand years, if they're working in separate departments.As the night progresses, the crowd thins.The salty historian returns a few hours later, but I shake my head before he can say a word and he storms off again, this time for good.I almost feel bad for him.Cooped up all day pouring over musty texts (old even back in his day) - and then having to synthesise it all into some dry report - would make anybody want to get fucked up on the dance floor, but I have to do my job and he knows it.Slowly the crowd thins to zero and I can go home.Ronny, my girlfriend, might be getting home soon too.She works nights as well.She's a night scout actually - with *optolux* and *auribus* - basically she walks the streets and calls the police when she hears or sees any petty crimes being committed.Much cooler than my job.Cop patrols aren't nearly as efficient as they'd have you believe, so she does their job for them.Actually, she's recently sent in an application for telepathy so she can skip the whole dialling them on the phone thing, but I'd doubt they'll grant it to her.Telepathy is a pretty heavily demanded gift, and the enclave likes to really squeeze you for service for the nice ones.I call an Uber and text her as I hop in."See u soon babe?""mmhm" "home in 20 mins."As I doze off in the back of the car, a smile flits across my face.
