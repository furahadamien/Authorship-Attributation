Realizing that you now have a chance to stop the greatest evil ever to walk the planet, you take steps to prevent it.You manage to convince your fellow apes you must always live in the trees, it becomes a religious precept that apes living on the plains is are evil and must be killed or sterilized.This changes the course of hominid evolution, preventing the evolution of Homo Sapiens.Thus you have prevented the emergence of the worlds greatest evil, because without the existence of human beings, that evil could never arise.Thus have you given your (whatever it is called now) species the greatest of blessings possible by preventing the emergence of lawyers.
