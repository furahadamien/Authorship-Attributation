"Welcome to Vlads Mats and Rugs, how may I help you?"Ella looked bored, in her black eyeliner, purple shadow and spider earrings that hung from drops of silver.She tried to force a smile but decided against it because it wouldn't reach her eyes and she'd only freak out the customer."Hello, I'd like to buy... Actually are these on sale?""No ma'am only the items in the blue section are for sale this week.""But I found this in the blue section."Ella had to strain not to roll her eyes.'one of these.'she thought."I apologise, but this item is not on sale.I guess someone placed it there by mistake.""Don't you have a company policy?The customer is always right?"Ella could feel her blood vessels surging.She thought of arguing but decided the better alternative."Sure.It's on sale.All you have to do is fill out this survey with your members card, you'll get discounts year round on all rugs, curtains and bathroom items.""Yeah, that's what I thought."The woman triumphiantly signed the digital pad with her name, number and best of all address.Ella smiled."Thank you for signing up.As a show of thanks we will throw in this free welcome rug."The woman smiled wide, happy at being pampered."Oh!Awesome.Thank you.""No problem.Thank you for being a member."Vampires never killed their prey, that would quickly reduce the supply.Instead you simply turn them over and bite, the analgesics in the saliva would prevent them from waking or feeling the bite.But this one, Ella thought, was deserving of a nice painful bite."Hope to see you soon.And don't forget, to lay down your welcome mat."Ella smiled, her boss would be happy.One more on the menu and she'd be happy.One angry customer getting what she deserved.A bite on the ass.
