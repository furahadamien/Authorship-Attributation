They always set their steps on different cobblestones, pass through alleys of different shades of black, and pride themselves of climbing up to different doors.But when you put your feets right behind theirs, it's always the same sight.The same billboards.The same looks.The same day in the jungle.Always a different legend they're trying to write with their own corrupted sense of grandiosity, but you always read the same chronicle once you can squeeze a read of the journals and a cigarette after a harsh day.''TWO MEN ARRESTED FOR GRAND THEFT... 
MURDERER OF THE BAKER'S STREET FOUND...SUSPECT OF THE BURGLARIES APPREHENDED...''

Worse part is finally cathing them.When you're still a little boy taking care of his gun like it's his pristine pride , you keep your straight-face but love the pumping rush.When the feeling dulls, you can only look at them through your tired eyes utter the same words as the previous guy.Pleading to not be sent to the yard.And like a litle child, when the tears have no effect, the tantrum starts.You're grabbing them by the handcuffs and their face almost split in disgust.Suddenly, you're now the bad guy for making them suffer the smell.''Bloody chimney sweeper, I'd cut your lung open if I was free but I'll be happy knowin' you'll do it yourself!''''I'm only doing my part in this little city'' as I always told thoses elitist-smeller.''You make my pay, I make the tobacco shop's down the street.''When they get tired of talking you escort them towards the yard and rejoice at the thought of the walk of shame;

You may have caught someone who, just the other day, was stealing from the same person that look at you with judging stares, but today, you're the criminal.You may be one of the last good cops from an era long forgotten, and yet, they only pity for the poor man who did not deserve to be cuffed to me.The walls that once insulted policemen in graffitis, now still insults you in a more choking way.Who can breath in this city without being lost in dark clouds?Thoses folks who fake coughs when you walk past them and feels as if they done something great are the firsts to burn down from the needs of their lives.The children's begin their finger-pointing lesson when they see the ashes I leave behind, and always get the same answers from their mother.It's always the same.Once you walk back home, in the same modest apartment, with only the cold, blue, light of a television to welcome you ; you feel as if you're just another men living with the thoughts of what could have been.Talking to a chair, where sat a man that once shared the same value as you.Swept away, like all old cats of the city.The city is always the same.The peoples are replaced, the criminals simply can't quit but I can't blame them because neither can I.

''Arnold, do they sell Camel up there?''Edit : English is not my 1st language ; got to fix the mistake I'm able to see.
