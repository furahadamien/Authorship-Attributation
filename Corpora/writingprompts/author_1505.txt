Fuck outta here. Thats what I think when someone asks me about my missing arm.It was hard enough to live without something which has carried me and carried for me my entire life, and now these assholes approach me and ask me, How does it feel to lose an important limb without which you are unable to perform important actions? Well, I had suffered worse in Vietnam.But whats worse is this feeling that my trigger arm is still there.Imagine an Ex-Girlfriend knocking on your door telling you how much she still loves you, and then she breaks the door down and tried to strangle you.Phantom Pain, they are called.Well, I have suffered worse in Vietnam.But what happened yesterday was how do I put it?It was fucking weird, almost like the 2015 election.It was night time.I was reading some good old Agatha Christie, when I heard some strange noises coming from my kitchen.Laughing, gagging, snorting, and the like; sounded like a drug dealer threw a party.What in the living fuck? I thought.I got out of my chair  and no, I dont have the rocking type, who the fuck reinforced that stereotype?I grabbed my rifle, I knew it was loaded; I always make sure it is.And slowly I made my way to the kitchen.I slowly turned the knob and looked inside  there was nothing.All was as it should be.I entered the kitchen and that is when a realization came to me, it was an ambush.Still, even if I knew what was coming, my training and experiences with the army couldnt have prepared me with what was to take place.As soon as the realization dawned on me, I felt a blow to my back.I fell to the ground, although I wasnt knocked out.I tried to rise to my feet, but fuck, I was old.As I lay there, trying to get back up on my feet, I could hear laughing  mocking laughter.It seems like those sick fucker were waiting for me to get up, they didnt play desperate; they wanted to see me put up a fight, like a cornered lion.I weighed my options, Either I run, or I fight. Feeling my back, I understood running was not an option.Well, I had a good run. I thought to myself as I rose up to meet my adversaries.I wish they were teens, I wish they were robbers who would kill me, I wish that they were anything other than what I witnessed.I saw two figures, they barely resembled humans.They were missing their eyes and all of their teeth.Their mouth looked like a blackhole.They were translucent, with disfigured arms.I screamed, louder than I thought I ever could.They came towards me and out of pure reflex, I punched one of them in the neck with my missing arm.What the fuck? I thought to myself, how in Gods world?It seems like the ghosts were mirroring my reaction.My surprise was suddenly replaced with anger, these fucking things came into my house and tried to kill me; I wasted no time.I tried to punch the first one in the gut with my real arm, but my hand passed through the figure.Makes sense. I thought, right before I threw a punch with my Phantom Arm.He gave a cry and dissolved into the Earth.The second one was still in shock, I uppercuted him and he too went with his bitch.They left scorch marks on the kitchen floor -- Unacceptable  


I wish I could tell you about how I am going to join forces with other amputees and start a war against them.But thats bullshit.Im too old, and it would end just like Kennedys war on drugs.There are horrors in this world that are beyond our understanding.But they can be beaten.I guess there is a God.Fuck, I want to go back to Vietnam.##                                                     -----
