Time sighed and crumpled up her newspaper as she got to the "Celebrity Deaths".She reached over to the nearby counter and took a large gulp of steaming coffee.Even though she was a predator to all mortal life, she couldn't help but feel raw envy as Death waltzed around, feeding off of her hard work, and finishing it with his own (honestly dazzling) touch.She would watch as the clock spun and a man would wither either away, only to die of a sudden curiosity of how many marshmallows he could fit in his mouth before she could feast on all those precious memories aged liked a fine wine.She would waste someone's time and make them ruin their lives with their silly websites and games to play with her food, ready it for the banquet, only for Death to talk them into killing themselves days later.She felt anger with a dash of envy.Sure, he couldn't kill her, for she wasn't that tasty or nutritious (she was also a higher being with deity-like powers, but that was a minor detail), but he got away with preying on other's rightful meals like a vulture.She had taken a liking to humans when they first gained sentience, but Death caught on quickly and trailed close behind.The humans believe that the food chain was as simple as a well-graphed pyramid.This couldn't be farther from the truth (it was at *least* a well-graphed dodecahedron).Rather, the food chain was utter chaos, with Time sitting patiently to one side, mortal life gnawing away at each other, inter-dimensional beasts looking hungrily in on the mortals like a dog waiting for his food, indigestible beings that live on distant moons laughing at their unfortunately-digestible prey, Death picking at the dying scraps that everyone else had stabbed people so hard for, Disease coming up with cruel concoctions to nibble away at everything's life only for it to be cured within a year, and Weather storming about throwing tantrums when the perfectly planned Tsunami he had aimed for that bastard Richard ends up drowning an unforeseen small island community.Sure, there were others, but they couldn't bother Time much at all.She was safe from anything material in her cozy pocket dimension.In fact, another being promptly titled "Consciousness" used to be the king of the hill until the library was invented, then he fell like a brick to the bottom, left only to grasp at newer civilizations far from Earth with depressing the knowledge that they too will someday learn his weakness: books.He sometimes got a scrap or two during these things called "elections", where humans would have Scream Fests in which whoever yells the loudest gets to run a country.And yet Time fantasized about the future of humanity.She dreamed they would quash death back, letting them grow ever older.So what if they destroy the rest of the planet and drag every other species alive with them?Death would a field day and leave Time alone.Disease was starting to starve, showing hope for Time.She was invested in these odd, hairless apes, and she was going to milk them until they were wiped from the planet.But until then, Time decided she would wait.That's what put her higher than every other cosmic predator, after all.Since the beginning of this deranged Cat and Mouse game (with a little four-armed beast and all-seeing God thrown into the mix), she had perfected the skill of patience.With the snap of a finger, another newspaper landed onto her lap.Her eyes scanned it before she put it back down and took another sip of her (now cold) coffee.She would gorge on the vast memories as human's perfections turned them into gourmet meals for Time and Time alone.With age comes wisdom, but with age comes forgetfulness as well.Time longed for the day where humanity left Death and let their minds fester and collect those juicy moments like a child in school running around with Play-Doh and sticking all the colors together while the others kids watched in disgust at the horrifying combination of pale yellow and dull magenta.But until then Time Sat and waited.It was what she was best at, after all.
