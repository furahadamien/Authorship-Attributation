I closed the book, and didn't move."Well," the angel said, "- how did you like it?"Even though I was dead, I still felt nauseated."Every single one.Every single decision I ever made was the wrong one.THE WRONG.FUCKING.ONE."The angel grimaced."Wow.That's...my goodness!That's actually quite impressive in a depressing way.I mean the odds are astronomical when you-"

"Is this hell?Is this some sort of Twilight Zone shit and my punishment is to know how awesome my life could have been or something?""Alright, settle down.You know, I think you're going to very much enjoy finding out why we show you all this...you more than most in fact."The book suddenly disappeared, and two normal looking doors appeared."Um, ok?"The angel gestured to door one."Behind this door is a new story, with all new choices.A whole new life for you to experience."He then pointed to the other door."This door, however, is the life you just had... however, this time you'll make different decisions.So normally, most people make bad decisions roughly 50% of the time.You, however, made bad decisions 100% percent of the time, which means-"

My jaw dropped as it dawned on me what the angel was saying."Which means that this time I would make 100% of the right decisions?"The angel nodded."That's right.Of course, you could always choose to start a new life if-"

I ran towards door two and threw it open.Things were finally going to go my way.

I opened my eyes, and realized I was young again.I also instantly knew I was dead somehow and this was the afterlife.Well, almost.I was to stand trial, but I had no idea who my judges were.Four individuals were to judge me, and I needed at least three votes to be able to move on.If I received only two votes, I'd be trapped here in purgatory, and if I had less than that...I didn't want to think about it.A booming voice rang out."THE FIRST JUDGE - HE WHO THOUGHT YOU THE MOST CRUEL."My heart dropped.Before me suddenly materialized a person that I feared and hated more than anything.My first husband.He spoke like a wounded child."You know, all I ever did was love you.I *worshipped* you.I would have done *anything* for you!And you... You left me.It took me so long to find you, and when I did - you got a restraining order!I then got locked up in a mental hospital for life because of you!Why?!Why couldn't you love me the way I loved you?! "The answer spilled put of me in a rage."Because you were a controlling, fucked up, manipulative *bastard*!You isolated me from my family and friends by emailing them horrible messages pretending to be me!You spread rumors about me at my work and I was forced to resign!Then you started going crazy if I left the house for longer than an hour and threatened to kill yourself if I left you!I was so afraid and felt trapped for so long.I finally gained the courage to leave when you threatened to hurt Steve.My biggest regret in life was not realizing sooner what a sick piece of shit you were."He was surprisingly stoic."I do not give her my vote," and with that he disappeared."This isn't fair!"I screamed.The booming voice spoke again."THE SECOND JUDGE - SHE WHO THOUGHT YOU THE MOST KIND.A woman appeared before me and smiled through tears.I lost my breath for a moment."Mom!""Don't worry lovebug, we'll be together in just a little bit...I know it.Because if whatever powers that be try to keep you from me I swear I will fucking let all hell break lose so they better-

"WHAT IS YOUR VOTE?"And you could hear just a hint of annoyance in its voice.I couldn't help but laugh.Only my mom would be crazy enough to curse and threaten the seemingly omnipotent being without a second thought for me.She rolled her eyes."What the fuck do you think?My baby was always the sweetest, kindest girl in the world to me!Of course she has my vote!I-" 

And before she could say another word she vanished."No!Wait!Please, bring her back!"I hadn't seen my mother in so long, and to be torn away from her so quickly was devastating."THE THIRD JUDGE - HE WHO YOU SAVED."A man I'd never seen before appeared, and I was very confused.I didn't recall ever saving anyone before, let alone this stranger.He smiled and looked somewhat astonished."Wow, I never thought I'd ever see you again.I've thought about you every so often throughout my life.I'm really glad I have a chance to thank you after all this time.So, thank you. "I shook my head."I'm really sorry, but I don't remember you.""Oh, I'm not surprised.You sat next to me in a bus for no more than ten minutes.I was going through a rough time in my life, and I was planning on killing myself when I got home.I had everything planned out, and I was writing down my suicide note on that bus when you suddenly asked me if I was a writer.I confessed about how I always wanted to be one, and you asked me what I liked to write about.Well, I ended up telling you about a story that I always wanted to make into a novel, and you said it sounded amazing.You told me I should do it, that I *could* do it.Well, I decided to hold off my suicide until after I finished my book."I got excited."And you decided not to kill yourself because your book was a huge success?"He laughed."Nope.Never actually finished it.I hit a writer's block, so I joined a writing group where I made a few friends, and through them met the love of my life.We had six children, and had up to eight grandchildren before I died.So yeah, you definitely have my vote."Just like that he was gone, and my heart swelled.I had no idea I had ever made such an impact on anyone in my life.But my joy was short lived when I heard what the voice said next.YOUR FINAL JUDGE - HE WHO DIED BY YOUR CHOICE.I couldn't believe it.Had I killed someone without ever knowing??I never would have guessed in a million years who it was.It was Steve, my cat."Oh, *Steve*..." and I could feel the tears come.I had Steve for twenty-three years, and loved him like family.He *was* family, especially during the dark times with my ex husband.He eventually got cancer, and when I  realized how much pain he was in, I had him put to sleep.I cried everyday for month, and would tear up every so often thinking about him for the rest of my life."I'm so sorry, Steve.There was nothing I could do...I didn't want you to suffer..."

And I finally lost it.After seeing my ex, my mother, a stranger whose life was made better for having met me, and now Steve, I couldn't hold back my emotions anymore.I dropped to my knees, and sobbed into my hands.So many questions ran through my mind.How could he possibly understand why I chose to have him euthanized?Did he even understand what had happened?How could he even vote?Was this whole system rigged?!I heard purring, and as I wiped my eyes I felt Steve rub against my side.Shaking, I picked him up, and cried more as he rubbed his head against mine over and over.The voice spoke one last time."VOTES AGAINST - ONE - VOTES FOR - THREE.YOU MAY PROCEED."I was expecting something grandiose like angels popping up with fanfare, or giant golden gates appearing and opening up for me.Instead a very normal looking door appeared.An indescribable joy washed over me."C'mon Steve, we better not keep Mom waiting."
