I re-read the article several times until I finally feel in understanding the words, but nothing seems to make sense.And the more I read about it, the more unreal it feels, and the more my head hurts.The article was 50 years old, but the similarities were entirely uncanny to pictures of myself from that time.Except the picture showed me in handcuffs being hauled away as if I was the most dangerous criminal.I read the article again and the same name jumped out at me again and again.It was my name.I immediately went to the computer to look up the entry, but it didn't exist.For a moment, I assumed it was a joke, but I don't remember ever having that kind of a picture taken.I kept searching for more news clipping from that time period, but all I found were all about how CityMan saved the day.CityMan stopped a bank heist.CityMan saves local firefighters and residents from being trapped in a burning building.But any clipping I find after the one I found, it seemed this CityMan had downgraded to saving kittens from trees every other weekend.A few years after my clipping, he disappeared.I found it weird that I didn't remember any of those events, but that was around the time I met my husband.Or, late husband now.I tear up entertaining the idea that my Jack died of cancer peacefully.I immediately remember the reason I was searching through the picture box was to find a nice photo of us for his grave stone.I dig further and further into the box, eventually turning it upside down when a secret bottom falls out along with a large manilla envelope.I open it to reveal a black and white picture of this CityMan and a young woman in a similar outfit.And in some weird way, it's almost as if I can see the outfit in my imagination, along with all the beautiful black and red outfit with a matching red skirt and black leggings.I can also remember the feel of the polyester as if it were under my clothes right now.And then I remember something had happened.Something bad.I couldn't figure out what, but I knew it was bad.I shake the weird memories away and shove the picture back into the envelope.I realize my mission and decide on a few boxes from the closet.I dig entirely through the old junk going farther and farther back, hoping to find another picture box that Jack may have hidden.Then, in the very back, I notice a rather old and dusty trunk.I drag it out hoping to be able to find something.Jack wasn't exactly the most photogenic person, but even a good one would have satisfied me.I open the trunk and see the outfit that the young woman wore in the picture, along with the very same one that the man wore, dressed like CityMan.I checked the tag, which said Jack.And also the typical black and white prison outfit which I saw from my newspaper clipping.I pick up the outfit and a folder falls open.A folder with my name on it from a mental hospital a few towns over.And the last thing inside it was a treatment sheet for electroshock therapy signed by the same family doctor I brought my kids to ever since their first shots.I picked up the folder and another sheet fell.It was a resignation contract from the mayor's office from the superhero CityMan, signed by Jack Willis, my husband Jack.(I would have written a better short story,  but its late and I'm too tired to think)

(Ugh why does waiting at the bank take so long) I thought to myself (the one day I'm not too busy to walk inside and the frickin lines are a mile long.)The people in front of me shuffle like zombies when the front guy leaves, meaning I'm moving about a foot from where I was before.(Seriously!!)There's a woman in front who brought her dang kid and IS HE SERIOUSLY COUNTING PENNIES ONE BY FRICKIN ONE!!!UGHHHH!!!This is why I never walk in the bank.I always prefer the drive throughs, but today I didn't have as many errands to run so I decided to walk in and maybe grab me an actual piece of candy without having to awkwardly ask for it bc I'm an adult who is supposed to be repulsed by the idea of sweets but hey, gotta love them little suckers.My thought process is immediately halted as three men with ski masks and assault rifles barge inside the door demanding everyone get down on the ground.I throw my hands up as one of them waves a gun towards me and I survey the door out of the corner of my eye, but I'm worried he will shoot me as it's too far away, so I slowly sink down to my knees before I hear the police sirens and he forcibly grabs my arm."Any funny business, and I shoot you all one by one," he yelled, "starting with you!"His tongue like a snake in my ear as I'm disgusted by the way he whispered it like a rapist.He slides his hand down my ass and I use my other hand to slap his away.He smiles and throws me down on the ground with force before he searches my pockets for whatever money he thinks I'm carrying, sliding his eyes down my boobs and stopping at the nametag sewn into my work shirt.He stops immediately and gets this horrified expression on his face.He jumps up and backs away slowly."What are ya doin, Paul!!""That's her!That's her!!The one the boss says we cant touch!!Im dead!!Im a dead man!!I can't do this, man!!"The man in the ski mask drops his gun and runs outside hands up to the police, surrendering himself.One of the other two men holds his gun towards me and demands I tell him who I am."I'm Kay.Kay Peterson."The second man becomes just as horrified, takes his mask off, and puts the gun in his mouth.Pieces of him go everywhere as everyone screams.I get up and look towards the third man, who looks too scared to move.Everyone's eyes are on me, like I'm some sort of savior.The third man is so terrified to move that he pisses himself as I walk closer.Then he starts spouting off nonsense about how I'm on a 'No Harm' list and his boss is gonna make them wish they were dead without actually giving them the pleasure of death."And who is your boss?"I ask.He drops his gun and falls on his hands and knees begging me not to tell his boss that he will do anything I ask as long as I did not tell that they held me at gunpoint, blabbering about how he has a family to support and he really didn't wanna do this, blah blah blah...

"Just give me a damn name!!"He climbs to his knees and starts praying in a foreign language and hands me a note before assuming his bitch position, still praying for dear life.I open the paper and become flabbergasted to the name as I had not heard it in many years.Eric Drake

But there was no way.Eric was always shy and reserved.He was the kind of guy that would do anything you needed from him.Albeit he was pretty naive at times.We became fast friends as kids and I admit I had a minor crush on him after the summer of '03 when he hit puberty and became hot, but regrettably that same year he moved and we lost touch a long time ago.He was the sweetest guy I knew.So there was absolutely no way that he could instill this much fear into a group of thugs.I tossed the paper into my pocket and threw my hands up when the police marched in and escorted everyone out.I also made a mental note to look Eric up on social media to see if I could find him again.
