I had a dream once that this was actually the case.I had died in a dream and went into the afterlife.Complete darkness save an orb of light illuminating people's faces, but no source of where the light came from.Everyone had one blue eye to see the past, and one red to see the future.They knew all, but the present, therefore their "minds" were kept in a state of purgatory.An old man in a rocking chair sat vacantly and communicated to me telepathicly stating that each dream of those alive right now is in reality, an alternate universe which we enter when we sleep.In some of those reality death does not exist and if I was to find a way to enter one and not wake, my soul of my current reality would be transferred and my body on earth as I know it would die.If I did wake, though, I would be given another chance upon dreaming to transfer again, and if not by the time I died, I would end up amongst those in the darkness for all of time.Kind of like "game over".He begged me that I would find a way and come back to my present reality and tell the masses.Wayyyyy weird, but has always stuck with me.
