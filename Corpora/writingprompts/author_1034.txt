I won a lifetime supply of Oreos when I was 10.Mom wasn't too happy, but I sure was.They kept coming, oddly, they still came after the bombs dropped.I was stuck in an inescapable concrete prison, a ceiling fell, and left me locked in a corner of my office.There's only one gap that leads to the outside.And the Oreos keep coming.They are my only source of food, I grow sick of them, but they are the only things I have left.I never see who drops them off, either.One time, they never got dropped off, and I start thinking that it's ironic.A lifetime supply of Oreos, but they are the thing keeping my alive.Maybe they realized that.
