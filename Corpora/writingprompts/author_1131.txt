"The rarest of tomes," the angel spoke, his hands trembling as he carefully placed a piece of paper in my hands."How so?"I asked, puzzled."This piece of paper chronicles your entire life.Every good decision, every bad decision, every good moment, every bad."The paper had under "actions" my date of birth, the words "the calling," and the date of my death.Under "outcome" it simply stated, "unchanged."I sighed.Having amounted to quite literally nothing in life it was no surprise that even in the afterlife I would have to be reminded of what a failure my life was."Ah, yeah, that, I am a failure of epic proportions that much is true," I admitted, handing the paper back.The angel looked shaken by such an outrage.Holding the paper up he stated, quite simply, "There are few mortal men who are divine saints without knowing it.You spent literal decades without affecting anyone.A saint in a monastery with a completely celebrate pledge doesn't put so much effort into such a display of purity.""So what now?"I asked, trying not to cringe about the obvious implications of my "purity.""You will of course join the rest of the purest saints in state as we wait for Armageddon.I think you're a fan of Issac Newton?"
