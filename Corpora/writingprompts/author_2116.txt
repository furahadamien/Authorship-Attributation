She was strange.Stranger looking than imagined at least.But still oddly attractive.Her hair was bright red and flowed down perfectly over her smooth pale face.The electric red lipstick contrasting her dark lined eyes.The torn pants and old combat boots, were quite unsettling, but she somehow pulled them off.With my head slightly tilted to the side, I thought of how safe I felt with her.Even though we were complete strangers, up until 15 seconds ago, she felt like... home."Are you seriously monolauging right now??God I hate it when you do that.I can still hear you ya know?""You're real?You're a real person?How is this even possible??"I stammered as I fully grasped what was happening right in front of me.This phantom voice I've heard for so long now had solidity.She was real.I wasn't crazy.Years of pills and doctors flooded my mind."So I'm not crazy?I'm just some weird fucked up...superhero?""No moron you're not in a comic book."She snidely replied."I'm you."She paused as she looked me up and down."An obviously better dressed you."I stared silently, as my thoughts began to race again.The synapses firing rapidly trying to process what was right in front of me.How could this girl, who look like she walked right out of a suicide girls photo, be me?We looked like a weird ass twist to that Taylor Swift song.The one with the music video of the neighbor kids crushing in each other."Christ you're unbelievable.It's you Belong With Me.Now come on we have to get moving."Sje grabbed my hand a little too hard and then we were off.To God knows where, and really, with God knows who?
