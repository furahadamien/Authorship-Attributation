Just keep looking down, just keep walking... Don't look up, Don't make eye contact.Is this what "the immortals" are to endure?Just yesterday they were all laughs at us "Lost Ones", as they called us, and today...Nothing...They can't speak, they move.We know they think, their brain still works, lite up like lava.When it started happening none of the doctors could do anything.They say it is a form of "lock in", like Robert Dinero in that movie "Awakenings".A prisoner in your own body.Imagine an eternity of this... God I hope they find a cure.
