To the Diary;

Hello Light, good to see you again.It's been a long time.I'd almost forgotten.It's weird writing real words again after so long.I'd gotten by with only Braille for the longest time.But yeah it's been a crazy 2 years.Honestly, I'm terrified.Most people on Earth died in the Great Blinding, or the "The Rapture" as we call it here.People wandering around, unable to do anything, stuck miles away from home.How could they live?I would have likely been 1 of them, if I wasn't at home married to a blind woman.We never really cared for each other before, but after, she was the only reason I continued to live.I guess she kept me alive out of obligation; more likely it was to ward off insanity.Honestly, the blind people are the only "normal" ones left now.All the rest are....something else.You hear them at night sometimes.....just shuffling around.They adapted, but there was a cost.I can.....see them now....with my own eyes...I don't like it....Honestly, the words don't bother me."DON'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE."It's written everywhere on everything.I suppose I'm the only person alive who can see them.But they don't scare me.The people who can't see, the ones who lived, they scare me....It's like a friend from before wrote me the advice.I'll follow it as long as I can.Thanks for letting me write to you again Diary.My wife's been uneasy lately so I can't talk to her.I suppose fighting off the "new blind" takes a toll on her.'Til next time.Bye.
