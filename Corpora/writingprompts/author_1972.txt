I stare at the alien.What are the

A searing, stabbing pain suddenly explodes in my legs and quickly spreads across my whole body like wildfire.I try to scream, to cry out, but its too late.My throat constricts.My jaws clamp.My whole body shuts down.With a look on its face that seems perhaps somewhere between shock and terror, the alien turns and flees.Im all alone now.I collapse back into the ground, my head bouncing hard against the pavement.Out of the corner of my eye I watch as blood trickles from my shattered skull.I lie like that for a time.A still conscious corpse unable to move, to breath, to blink or even move my eyes a little.Darkness blossoms in my vision, swirling everything away.My mind goes last.It feels strange, kind of like how Id imagine falling into a black hole would be...a stretching and a thinning passing away into nothingness.In my very last moments, I hear a voice that seems to emanate from somewhere within me.A voice that speaks in perfectly enunciated English.Housing unit #111124675846 has been shutdown.It was informed of our existence.We require assistance.Over.

I really wish I could scream.
