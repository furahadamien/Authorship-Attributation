Thea leaned back in her chair, letting her shoulders relax as she breathed out slowly through her mouth.He'd be here, tonight.At least, that's what he'd told her the last time she'd seen him, a decade before."The next jump I make to see you will be the first night of the new millennium!"he'd exclaimed."Even for a Traveler like me, that's exciting!""I guess it's old hat for you, though," he mused."After what, six thousand years, this must not be that big of a deal.""No, Tiff, the days all kind of melt together after the first two thousand years," she'd responded."Well, that's what we do, huh?I zip back and forth, and you get to see everything!Even with my machine, I still just get one lifetime."His face suddenly fell."I wish I could spend more than that with you, though."Thea laughed and kissed him on the cheek."I don't know, Tiff, one lifetime seems to be enough for most people."He'd grinned, slipped his arms around her, and drew her down to the bed with him."As long as I get to spend mine with you, that's enough for me."By the time she woke up, he was gone.She knew he was there after just a few heartbeats.A whiff of ozone, a faint white light, and he was standing across the table from her."Thea!Happy Millennium!"He leapt across the room, gathering her into a crushing hug."God, I have so much to tell you!The next few years get crazy, you should move off the mainland.""That's fine, Tiff," she interrupted."Have some wine.I've been saving it for you since the last time we saw each other.""Aww, how sweet!"He was grinning from ear to ear as he uncorked the bottle and poured the dark red liquid into two crystal glasses."It's so good to see you, I've missed you so much the past few months."A tight smile pursed her lips."Has it only been a few months for you?""Mmmhm" he responded around a mouthful of wine."I got caught up in the Kuiper Belt Mines War and just wanted to see you.Well, I guess I should say I *will* get caught up in it, two hundred and fifty-seven years from now.Love, you should have seen it, they were smashing asteroids together and raining debris down on outposts, it was insane."Thea watched as Tiff's face grew redder and redder as he spoke."Hey, Thea ...do you ...I don't feel right.Do you think that wine is off?"His eyes bulged, he clawed at his collar, and finally stumbled against the table and fell to the floor, gasping."Sorry, love."Thea moved around the overturned chairs to stand above Tiff."I guess the paralytic I coated the glasses in doesn't agree with you."Tiff's eyes darted back and forth as tears welled."Why ...why are you doing this?"Thea stooped and pulled the gold-plated Traveler's pocket watch from Tiff's jacket pocket.She held it up to her face and twisted the gold chain, breaking the candlelight and sending it spinning wildly around the room."How long have we been together, Tiff?"Tiff stared up at her, utterly confused, terrified."For ...forever, Thea.""No, how old were you when we met?""Twenty-six."Thea nodded."And how old are you now?""Thirty-two.""Six years.It's been six years for you."Thea shook her head."I was two thousand years old when I met you.I've given you four millennia, Tiff."She knelt to cup his face in her hand."And you couldn't even give me all of those six years, could you, you bastard?Showing up for the spectacles, then jumping off to the next adventure."Tiff choked through his tears, "I'm sorry I couldn't take you with me, but the Traveler's watch can only jump one person."Each breath came shallower and shallower now, harder and harder as his lungs slowly shut down."I wanted to show you everything, Thea."Thea's eyes blazed."I've already seen it, you idiot!I've been here for every goddamn second.Every war, every flood, every famine, every lazy fucking Sunday where nothing, nothing, nothing happened!Why the hell would I want to go back and live through it again?"Tiff's voice was barely a whisper."Thea ...I'm so sorry.I'm so sorry."He paused."I just don't understand."The fire in her eyes softened for a moment."I loved you, Tiff, I really did.For a thousand years and more.But you have what I don't."She stood and stared down into his glassy, open eyes."You have an end, Tiff."She held the Traveler's watch in front of her face again."And so does the universe ...I hope."A whiff of ozone, a faint white light, and she was gone.
