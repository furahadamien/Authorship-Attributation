I clicked the upvote arrow again, out of compulsion, not because I cared.Sure, the post contained a nice sentiment, but reality doesn't always match up with a stranger's happy wishes.Let's face it, a Christmas where my wife won't let me come over to see my own two kids, where I'm left to sleep in my car and forage for food in a truck stop down the street, that's a bad Christmas.I wrote my sad story, then clicked "Add Comment".
