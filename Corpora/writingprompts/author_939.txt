As the news broke the cold cobbled streets of Manchester that anti aging products stocks were depleted entirely, it hit me.No, not an idea, a mailbox.I couldnt tell whether the brisk shudder that surged my spine was generated from the freezing wind or the idea that I had spoke to the devil himself.A life of lucrative I promised for myself, yet now I live in a sad, anxious world, waiting for my death to come.Money cant buy the happiest of souls in a minute.Ive already spent 200 million dollars on a car Ill be too nervous to drive, a mansion with half of the rooms vacant, a wife who only is interested in sex and a rain of it when she climaxes, and a job where Im protruded as the awful devil himself, which Im ashamed to say is correct.My opportunity has been missed, now every mailbox spontaneously squatted in my direction is like the devil himself is plotting my instant demise at his defeat.There is no safe space anymore.In a Washington infested Palace of Bills, I sit on a golden throne sobbing tears of lava- knowing I would be a goner.The money wasnt worth it was the last thought I ever had.
