The two stupidest things about being a time traveller are money and clothes.Well, that's not true.There are three stupid things - money and clothes, and language.Even fifty years ago people are very distrustful of the syntax of my speech.I had to take graduate level English courses for years in order to make myself understood even five hundred years ago.And more than a thousand years ago it's another language entirely.In fact, it was during my studies that I met him.He was renown as the foremost scholar of Old English in the 1990s and had some fascinating ideas.So of course I wanted to interview him, and I set my time machine, which looked like a particularly huge and intricate belt buckle, thirty years in the past, and went to find him.He wasn't in his office at the University.He wasn't in the canteen, or in a meeting with another lecturer.The secretary directed me to a certain address, and of course, I found him in the pub."Oh, hell, it's you," he said."I beg your pardon?"I said.I appropriated a stool from a nearby table and took its worn and lumpy cushion off before scooting it closer to him."You are Dr Sinneard, are you not?""Aye," he said."You're that one nosy woman who can't leave well enough alone.Well, Miss Nose, I've only had three pints and I need another before you try to pick my brains.Again."I paid for his pint with the best forged 1990s money I could buy on the internet.When I came back he only grunted instead of saying thank you, and took a healthy gulp.He made a face, and then turned to me."So how can I help you now?"He seemed young for a lecturer, and had distractingly bouncy ginger curls and a freckled nose.His hair was slightly too long for the fashion, but that could be part of his fusty lecturer look.His eyes, however, were sharp (even after three pints) and focused on me with a look I would call weary resignation."You must be mistaking me for someone else," I said."Oh, it's our first meeting, is it?In that case, do me the exquisite favour of conducting your own research.I'm not a walking textbook.""I, ah....I assure you that I would only like your opinion about a couple of pronunciation issues -"

"That's what you say," he nodded, sagely."You always say that.You said that when I first met you, too...  You sprung me out of some dank gaol, close to Worthington, and you know I'm grateful, but gratitude only goes so far and that was a long time ago.We've met about 30 times in the last 500 years, and each time all you want to do is have me translate the old words to you.Well, it's near the time you were born, if I'm any judge of this whole living thing, and I understand now that you are just lazy.Simply lazy.I even wrote a book about the old tongue, just to avoid all this nagging.Why don't you go read it?"I peeled my tongue off the roof of my mouth."How old are you, then?"He was looking at me with spritely affront, but at my words, he closed his eyes and leaned back against his chair.He seemed to curl slightly inwards upon himself, and his fingers started tapping gently on his knees.Concerned, I reached out - but his eyes flicked open again and regarded me through the weight of many centuries.He said, "Twelve thousand years.Perhaps... twelve and a half.My book is called 'Old English for Dummies', under a pseudonym.I have dedicated it in your name."He left, and I found the book in a second hand shop three decades later.But it raised more questions than it answered...
