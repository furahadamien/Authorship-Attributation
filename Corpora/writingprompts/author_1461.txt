I don't know why they care so much.It's not like I'm hurting anyone besides myself.I rarely smoke in public these days, and when I do it just doesn't feel right.I don't even smoke when reading the newspaper anymore because I can't handle seeing myself on page 7 everyday.Oh what's John up to today?There he is having a smoke in the alley behind his house.What a bad person.What a bad guy.I hate that John.Always smoking up the place.Sure, it's not the best thing to be doing or spending my money on, but I like it.I like the way Muhammad's face lites up as he grabs me a pack of cigarettes from his dwindling stock.He's the only person in this city that still sells these cancer sticks.And I'm the only one that buys them.So, we have a bit of a serious relationship.I keep buying them everyday.He gets to continue operating his store.He's a nice guy, that Mohammad.Not a lot of people visit his store these days.Mostly because of me.Because I refuse to quit this silly addiction that I love, yet everyone hates me because of.It's been years since the tobacco riots, and even longer since president Sherman issued a cull order on all drug users.I survived that as a baby and was one of seven people that were grandfathered into the new world as a drug user.I am also the only remaining of those seven babies.I fear that my days are numbered as the propaganda has become increasingly hateful everyday.Usually limited to the paper, radio, and the occasional television ad ranting about how I am a literal demon sent here to destroy this marvellous fascist society; they have turned most of the electronic billboards in the city centre to ads targeting me.I've heard rumours of the authority killing Mary Ellesmere after the truce, but I don't think they would do it so blatantly now that I'm the last one left.My fear is but just that."Sergent Capolo drops the brown leather bound journal to the floor and stands upright from his crouched position.He turns to the other armoured soldiers standing behind him and gives them a nod.They begin the pour gasoline on the floor of John's apartment.As Sgt.Capolo reaches the door he pauses momentarily and backtracks the room toward John's almost unrecognizable body laying lifeless.Sgt.Capolo crouches next to the body and plucks the package of cigarettes from the chest pocket of Johns work shirt and places them in his breast pocket.He leaves the apartment.
