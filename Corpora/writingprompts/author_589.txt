"...and keep the boards level!Don't rush it!"The mountainous fellow chimed brightly to his coworkers before he swung his massive sledgehammer through the wall.Big, bold, broad, and bald, Larne Leadman pushed his weight through the hole to bring the rest of the wall down around him, the brick crumbling down his shoulders. "There's no need to keep up with me!"There was nothing Larne enjoyed more than demolition, and he was good at it.Amazing at it in fact.He could brush off cave-ins as he barreled through mountains to open new mines.He could dip his hands into molten steel to squeeze a broken crucible shut.His friends in labor joked that he should take to being a superhero, but that was never his speed.Breaking things was all he really wanted to do, and there was plenty of good work in that field.Today, he was bringing life back to a destroyed district of Bell City, by tearing down old buildings that were barely left standing from some terrible disaster some time ago.His crew left him to tearing down most of the place, while they focused on clean up and scaffolding in his wake.He hummed a tune to himself as he swung and punched through layer after layer of concrete and steel.Another wall down, and he found himself in the remains of an apartment, buried under six obliterated floors.Most of the furnishings were in various states of decay, and the smell of spoiling meat and mold hit his nostrils, pulling him out of the ecstasy of destruction.The walls creaked and cracked, Larne's actions had weakened everything keeping this place in-tact.He dropped his hammer and searched out the source of the smell.The broken remains of a couple that had been entombed there were all he found.Scattered cans and boxes showed they survived the initial disaster, but died before any kind of help could have arrived.Larne was shaken at the sight, confused and heartbroken.His confident shoulders dropped as he bowed his head silently a moment, his once smiling face broken.Pulled away from his quiet by another rush of foul air, he set to search out the identity of the couple.No telling how long the walls would hold, so he didn't have much time.He scanned through the various papers and mail they had scattered on a table, and could see the scrawled curses this couple had written against a "Hazmat".They hated this person with every fiber of their remaining days.Larne was close to sharing the couple's feelings on Hazmat, until he found the newspaper story, on Hazmat's upcoming assault on Bell City.He saw the picture.He saw the headline.Hazmat's plan to bring the world crumbling beneath his feet.A man ready to detonate a nuclear weapon at point-blank range, just to watch the carnage it caused from the front row seats.It was him.It was Larne.He was Hazmat.Larne threw the whole table like he had just found a nest of spiders, smashing it against the opposite wall, making the already brittle walls crack even more.Who was he?What could have brought him to do this?Pieces were missing.Three women, some kind of weird greek names, though none of them were greek.They were members of some organization.They changed something in him.What was it?Did it matter?He snapped out of his thoughts and looked down at his hand.It was in a tight, shaking fist.His nails were cutting into his palms, and shimmering green blood was dripping out of it, lighting up the whole room.He had never seen his own blood before.Or did he?It sizzled and melted the ground where it dripped beneath him.What was he?The questions kept pouring in, and it only made him more anxious."Boss!You alright in there?"The sound broke through the chaos in his mind.The building was crumbling even more around him, but this place had held his secret long enough.He slammed his fist against one of the supports, bringing the whole building toppling down around him, crushing him beneath the ruins.Not that it mattered, as he would crawl out of the debris within a few minutes, swimming through the rebar like it was water.His friends gathered near the crumbling rocks to reach out and help him out, but he waved them off."It's alright, this is nothing."He said with his usual chipper smile."You boys should have been there when half of San Gabriel tried to pin me down."He brushed off concrete dust and pointed back at the worksite."Lets break early for lunch, I'm buying us all burgers."Cheers from his friends reminded him who he was now, and he was Larne Leadman again.He wasn't Hazmat anymore.He didn't want that deceased couple's hate on his heart, he didn't want that horrible life back.Whatever the Fates had decided for him, he was happy where he was, and he would never look back.Though finding out he could probably survive a nuclear blast was giving him ideas for new career paths.
