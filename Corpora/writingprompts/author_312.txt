Flashing back through dream 37.It's a split second but I see a flash of her face and in that sliver of a moment; her eyes stare dead into mine.I consciously feel the corners of my mouth as they try to smile wider.I look at hers, she's halfway through a word but it doesn't matter, she looks as beautiful as I remember.And then she's gone again.
