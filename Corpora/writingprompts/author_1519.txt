I wake up.Normal routine as always.Eat breakfast, brush teeth and put on clothes.I walk to the supermarket and during the walk, I think of something fun to do.I'm in no rush, I could take 3 hours.I go to a small patch of land, mostly unnoticeable.I start punching and pushing these ghosts monitoring me.The last punch is one I will remember forever.I punch a ghost that retaliates back and pushes me into the soil.I yell "YERT!"and try to get back up.The ghost shakes me annoyingly.I try to punch once again and fail.The ghost picks me up and plops me near the sidewalk.Well, that turned fun into insanity.If someone was watching they would think I'm the weirdest amputee.Here comes shopping.
