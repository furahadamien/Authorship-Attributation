Sleepwalks
DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON.My eyes were barely open, bleary with sleep, but the incessant buzzing of the phone against the glossy black wood of the bedside table was just passing the point of ignorable.It took me a moment to register that the words were strange, holding their place at the top of the screen in bold, official letters, while the green icons of text messages scrolled beneath.Do not look at the moon?What the hell kind of late April Fools joke was this?I scoffed quietly, glancing down over the stream of messages.Moon shit, moon shit, and moon shit.Whatever.Had to be some kind of gag, and frankly, I didnt have the goddamn time for it.Work came early in the morning, and I had what, two hours left before I had to wake up in order to beat traffic?Fuck this.I powered the phone off to quiet the buzzing, and dropped my hands down to rest on my chest, phone still resting beneath.And with the screen out of my line of sight, that was when I noticed her.My wife was a beautiful woman-- The sort of beautiful that comes after a good decade of married life.That kind of beautiful with a few lines around the eyes, and a few strands of stray silver in her dark hair.Not that I could see them from where she was, standing silhouetted by the streaming moonlight pouring in the window, her hands resting lightly on the glass.Anna? came my groggy mumble of a voice.No response.She just stood there, staring upwards in the bath of silvery light.Was the moon always this bright?Or had I just never really noticed it before?Anna, cmere, I said a little louder, reaching out a heavy hand towards her and dropping it back down onto the sheets.Nothing.Concern slowly began to stir somewhere in my gut as I stared at her familiar outline.I could see the dust in the air, floating lazily in the shafts of moonlight that her body eclipsed.Her nightgown wasnt sheer, but as awareness began to settle in on my suddenly very awake mind, I realized the light was shining straight through.That was far, far too bright for moonlight.And that was when she turned her head, the movement just a little too slow, too smooth.In the perfect, bald light I could see her face.So familiar, with those smile lines around her lips, even with the neutral blank of her expression.Her dark brows lifted over eyes familiar in shape, even if the harsh shadows made them look like strange, blackened pits.And then she finally looked at me.I knew she looked at me.It was unmistakable with the way her pupils reflected the moonlight, like some nocturnal hunting cat.Her lips parted and she whispered, her soft voice clear.The moon-- its beautiful tonight.Come look.
