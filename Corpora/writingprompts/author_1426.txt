I had a mild panic attack today.Child 17 was teetering on the edge of a cliff while her adults (13 and 42) scrounged for food.Thinking on my feet, and remembering that scrumptious tale about the candy house and cooked children, I quickly created a trail of delicious foodstuffs to lead them to her.However the greedy wretches were so obsessed with gathering the foodstuffs that I was forced to beguile one of the last pandas (dont ask me how those guileless fucks survived) to take Child 17 by the hand and lead her to her erstwhile guardians, who praised the bountiful gifts that Life had given them that day.My God how I loathe humans.Greedy, bumbling wretches.I used to love coming up with beautifully ironic deaths for them.Have you seen that show Six Feet Under?Lets just say Alan Ball and I had some conversations.He was an inveterate flatterer, wheedled my best tricks out of me, and stiffed me on the residuals.Last time I take a flat rate consulting fee.Canny motherfucker.What sin have I committed that my fate must be yoked to these shortsighted hair-deficient fools?When they were on the rise killing them was a pleasure.When they were overfilling the earth like parasitic cockroaches killing them rose to a calling.But now.How do I spend my days?Saving their worthless little lives.And for what?So I can continue to have, what, a consciousness?Wham bang lightning flash.All these millennia around them, and Ive been infected by their culture.Take a job you hate to sustain an existence that makes you miserable.Fuck that shit.Ill flick my little finger and kill them all.Better to fade away than survive in misery.Im sure theyll thank me for it
