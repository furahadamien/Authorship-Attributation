Hell had broke loose in Georgia, since the Devil made his move
Fixed by the divine, things turned out fine.Then a challenge for Johnny to prove
God came down from the heavens to see the devil with corn popped
God sat next to old Johnny boy and said "Son, let me tell you what.""My dear boy you should know, too much pride's a sin
You're better than most but you made a boast that you're the best there's ever been
Forgiveness is what I do, boy, but confession's where you must begin
So take back your words or face the Lord, but there's no chance you'll win"

The boy said, "My name's Johnny, and I know that I have sinned,
But I'll take your bet; you're gonna regret 'cause hell I'll win again."Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard.Rapture's come to Georgia, and you sure ain't no bard 
If you win, you'll prove your skill is better than tales of old
But if you lose, it's another fall for th' prideful

God said "Johnny, you've until I start to begin to grovel"
Then snapped fingers and flashing light left a fiddle of pearl
When the bow was pulled across the strings, even the devil grinned
The earth itself, and all of nature couldn't help joining in

When God finished, Johnny said, "If this is my last chance
Fuck it all, let's have a ball, my music'll make you dance!""Fire on the Mountain."Run, boys, run!The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough.Granny, does your dog bite?No, child, no.Johnny sawed his bow across that fiddle pure and raw
Leaving kings of both Heav'n and Hell gaping mouths in awe
Time stood still as they both realized Johnny'd won again
Hell itself damn near broke loose 'fore Heaven let him in, when he played

"Fire on the Mountain."Run, boys, run!The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
The chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough.Granny, will your dog bite?No, child, no.
