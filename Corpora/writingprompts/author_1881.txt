Purgatory's actually a pretty nice place, as it turns out.Most people aren't forgotten right off the bat when they die; only a few poor souls each year take the expressway up to Peter's place.The rest of us, well.Most of us just wait around here, pick up a hobby or two, gossip about what's going on down there in the mortal realm.Not much different from life, really, except the food's already included.Maybe a little *too* similar.You see, a while back, once of the angels let some heavenly details slip.Poor thing was sentenced to a millennium working for his older brother down low, but the information's still out there.We're not really sure whether God doesn't know or just plain doesn't care, or if he wants us to keep doing what we're doing, but the info hasn't been erased from existence, so that's good enough for us.I glanced around me, before quietly pushing the balding head down, back through the clouds.So, apparently how heaven works is that you get everything you ever wanted.Want to eat food for forever?You've got it.Endless harem of beauties waiting on you?You've got it.Master every skill ever?*You've got it.*

The thing is, any rational person knows that sounds like a hell exactly of its own.Oh, sure, it'd be fun for the first few days, but after a year?A decade?A century?I shuddered a little at the thought, remembering some of the secondhand descriptions my friend had given me.So, to keep a long story short, someone decided there was no way in hell that they were going to get sent to *either* place.To do that, you've got to be remembered -- you've got to have people talk about you.Million-dollar question: How do you do that?You're already dead.Answer of a millennium?If you're *real* careful, you can send other people back.Have them talk about you.The guy who chose me isn't around any more -- the angels caught him, eventually, and he was taken up to the gates, to be damned in hell or damned in heaven.But before he left, he gave me the gift -- the gift of being remembered.I spotted another head rising up through the clouds.A young one, this time.Grabbed on, gave him a good eyeful of me.I doubted I looked like what he expected, but things change in a couple thousand years.He opened his mouth, "Am... am I dead?"I glanced around again.Still no patrolling angels."Not for long you aren't.When you get back, tell them Jesus sent you."
