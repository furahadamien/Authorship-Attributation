Cast:....Assholio, A Gentleman of Reddit



    Scene:....A Downtown Mall.People are hurrying by,
    carrying cups of coffee.Assholio stops abruptly, and looks at the ground in front
    of his feet.He addresses the audience.ASSHOLIO:

    This day, perhaps, may be the day I veer,
    From this line of green, which heretofore hast,
    Led me onwards and never sent me wrong.E'er since that day when I look'd down and saw,
    A guiding line, of verdant, shining green,
    Which line I follow'd, and which has always,
    Led me true, and always on the good path.The line I followed on that fateful day,
    When I turned right instead of left and then,
    Because of this dextrous step in my route,
    I happ'd upon the lovely maiden who,
    After many nights of love said "I do."And has, since that day, been my wond'rous wife.The line which guided me when other men,
    Were doing what they thought was right, and good.God's truth!as happenstance would later prove,
    Their path was not so good, and made them lost,
    While my path, which at first seem'd slow and bare,
    Would later lead me to a great reward.So now I stand here, rich, and sleek, and fat.And in this world of men I have no debt,
    No illness mars my fam'lies health, nor mine,
    And all around, where e'r I look I see:
    My friends, who smile at me and welcome me,
    And thus I know this path of green is right.But yet, I cannot quiet that inner thought,
    Which speaks to me, in doubt, and dark of night,
    And says "Assholio!Take not the green."And whispers "Take the other line of red."Wherefor should I confine my path to green?For though it's led me right thus far, who knows,
    Where might the green line lead tomorrow's morn?Perhaps the red would more successful be?Perhaps this other line would guide me best,
    And make my destiny much greater still?For many years I've struggled with this thought:
    That I, Assholio, should follow red.There!Tis done!The decision's made, and now...

    [ASSHOLIO follows the red line, slips on a puddle of water,
    falls down an escalator and dies.]
