*"Is it true you can only see three basic colors?"* the alien being asked."Just about.Our eyes have three major primary colors perceived by the cones in our eyes, and most of the colors we perceive on what we call the visible spectrum are a mix of Yellow, Red, and Blue."*"So, how do you communicate with the Ghoosha?"*

"With whom?", I responded confused.*"The Other Major race on your planet."*

"I wasn't aware of any other such intelligent race."*"But you keep care of Ghoosha ambassadors in major cities.Surely you've established a means of communication.You have hundred of humans meeting with them every day.When we arrived, we spoke to them first.They welcomed us to your planet with a spectacular display of dazzling colors and welcoming patterns, as well as a three hour dance of peace."*

"Care to describe where these Ambassadors are?"The alien fiddled with their glowing tablet for a moment, and then responded.*"My computer tells me that even within the borders of this country, there are ambassadors in the locations you would call Gulfport, Mississippi, Orlando, Florida, Indianapolis, and San Diego, California."* 

"There must be some kind of mistake, those aren't major capitals of the U.S. Would you care to describe what the Ghoosha look like?""They are distantly related to the Homo Sapiens, different order but the same class of Mammlia.Unlike the fingers you have, they have pectoral flippers, and a tail fin for propulsion.The Ghoosha told me that humans have an understanding where they are allowed to occasionally visit their domain of over 71% of the surface of the planet for the purposes of sharing food and using transportation.""Wait a minute ... flippers?Do they have a breathing hole on their back?"*"Yes.They also use the surface of their skin on their back to relay messages and communicate on top of regular verbal singing.We thought you humans were the same, as you have*  *and also use unusual singing and verbal communication."*

"Flippers, blow holes, in a few cities, making performances ... are you talking about Dolphins?"The alien once again checked their tablet.*"Correct, although we are aware they don't like being called that."*

"But humans don't have stripes.And last I saw them, which granted was when I was still a teenager, Dolphins don't change color."*"Do you not use cameras to translate their performances?What colors do you see the Ghoosha as?"*

"I dunno, I'd say a solid grey?"The alien looked perplexed, then twisted their tablet around to face me.*"Would you care to tell me what you see on my screen?"*

"Looks like a solid white to me."*"There is so much more to the spectrum that you've been missing."*
