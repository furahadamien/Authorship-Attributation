Our species does not typically work together.Apart from mating, seeing another spider of our kind just means competition for food.But word spread of the Quartz Boy.Now, we will freely admit that we are not normal spiders.Supposedly in time immemorial a human weaver was blessed with the body of a spider.She then bred when the time came, and laid spiders who were smarter than normal.But even we are pests to the humans, who purge us with sprays.We would have avoided this one, but for the rotting fruit on this one's counter.Fruit flies were supping upon a dragonfruit, and we had laid traps.Nets on most corners, baited with pieces of sweetener and sugars.Our ichor drooled somewhat as we awaited the feast.But then the Boy came.In the language-sight that was integral to our intelligence, he was like the sun, a radiant ball of energy.On his shirt was a stylised five pointed star, appropriately."Hi Spiders, listen, my moms don't want you in the house, so if I let you guys out, and give you these flies, you can come visit any time."We stared at him."I know you hear me.Spiders might make webs but not all trapeze onto fly backs."We glared at the spider that did that stunt."Are you guys former cr-"

We left, not listening to his words

But we maintained a few threads into his room.To listen for danger.For we are the Daughters of Arachne,

And wherever evil lurks,

if evil lurks,

we'll always find a way,

and even if we can't,

we'll find another way.There are over sixty two billion of us, and we protect the Quartz Boy Steven!(so I kinda watched 40 episodes of Steven Universe last night and it's all I can think about now)
