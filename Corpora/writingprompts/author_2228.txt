In a distant part of the galaxy there was a star, a burned-out white dwarf.And around this star spun a rock, wiped clean by the star's expansion in the distant past.Frozen in ice, with a single ring around it, it sent out signals at the speed of light, and had been for billions of years.It was a curiosity, and no amount of excavation had been able to find the signal's source.The message was clear: "We are here!We are here!"But of the messengers, none remained.It was a major discovery to find small objects made of gold, an element known for its stability.Rings, necklaces, even coins buried in various places, far beneath the ice.Around the galaxy, theories were crafted and thrown around like no tomorrow.The best evidence available suggested a civilization created 2-5 billion years before what was previously thought to be the earliest-known lifeform.But those small objects were it.There was nothing else.Nothing to else suggest a small sentient species far from the center of galaxy-spanning empires had *been*.And then, decades later, on one of the small orbiting chunks of the planet's ring, the source of the signals was found.A small, rectangular sheet of steel encased in gold, holding a small transmitter.On it were many symbols, writing of some sort.So many academics spent years, decades trying to decipher the message of the First Ones.And when they did, they cried.For it was a message of peace, of accomplishment, of hope.Though the First Ones were alone, and now gone, they had never stopped striving."Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind."
