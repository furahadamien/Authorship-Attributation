"Look I'm telling you, I'm not here for the experience or whatever you call it, I'm doing routine inspections."Michael was fed up with the demon's stubbornness, and very much annoyed that he'd trusted Raphael with his gateway badge.He made a mental note to never lend his crap to Raphael the day before he went to play guardian angel to a Colombian drug lord.Who knows where in South America the idiot was at this point.The demon shrugged, "Sorry sir, says here that you're Michael Gingrich.You've recently suffered from a fatal heart-attack.Terribly sorry bout all that sir.Not to worry though, the shock will wear off soon."Micheal sighed and tried again."Ok look, I see that you're expecting a Michael, but I'm not your guy.I'm *the* Michael.I've misplaced my badge but you've gotta know who I am.Archangel Michael?Gatekeeper to heaven?The demon nodded furiously with no indication of belief."C'mon this has to be ringing a bell.We've gotten some cutbacks in the Heaven recently so we're surveying other afterlives to see what's working and what's not.It's actually quite humbling, have you ever visited Valhalla?Christ it's amazing, I'd love to work there if only Odin wasn't such a tyrant.They don't get dental!Although our plan isn't great.I'll tell you what, one of these days I'm gonna talk to Satan about forming some kind of unio..."

Michaels rant was rudely interrupted by the floor collapsing, and Michael found himself sliding down a spiraling purple slide.He grabbed onto the side to slow himself only to discover it was covered in what felt like lube.Seeing as his powers were suspended in Hell, he gave up trying and hoped the slide let off into something besides hellfire.This day was really starting to get to him.Ten minutes and a chapped ass later, Michaels ride ended abruptly in a blow up ball pit.He'd spent a good portion of his ride imagining better ways to discipline the demon that did this to him.Other than stationing him in hell of course.He doggy paddled through the balls to the edge to take a good look around.His stomach sank.The atmosphere certainly felt hellish, flames erupted from crevices all around and a red glow faded into darkness in the distance.It was hot too, but comfortably so, not like a Florida summer.Something felt off as he clambered out of the ball pit onto spongy ground."What the hell..." Michael intoned.He was walking on padded surface that resembled gym mats.Crudely painted gym mats that were dark red except where the paint was cracked and baby blue crept through.He walked over to a pit of fire that was in fact, a pit of see-through plastic flames kept afloat by poorly hid fans with red neon lights running around the base.He ran over to a towering rock wall only to discover it was what could only be described as papier-mache."What kind of hell is this?"Welcome to Heck Mr.Gingrich."The demon was back."You!I am going to have a talk with Satan, he and I go way back, he won't stand for this."The demon smiled, "Unfortunately, Satan has no jurisdiction in Heck.Was your ride comfortable Michael?Do you mind if I call you Mike?"Micheal's brow furrowed.He ignored the question."So this obviously isn't Hell, so what in the hell is Heck?"The demon continued to smile and batted his eyes a few times."Well.Since you asked Mike, Heck is the afterlife where you go when your sins are unremarkable, and your virtues few and far between.So I'd say youll fit right in!"Michael was trying his best to remember that he was an archangel, and that God looks down on assault.Even assault on a demon.Michael growled, "Where, demon, is the exit?"The demon flourished his hands, and a booming voice proclaimed, "To exit Michael, you must first stand trial for the seven unremarkable and ultimately forgivable sins."Michael stood speechless for a minute.Then two minutes.His fists were clenched and bone white.Finally he spoke, So demon tell me.What are these seven sins?

The demon replied, Well, theres flaking, that ones bad.I can tell you do that a lot.Then theres chewing loudly, not bathing often enough, masturbating before marriage, offering bad advice, and any and all forms of tailgating. 

Michael leaned against the ball pit.Thats six.You said I needed to stand trial for seven.

The demon squealed, Oh I forgot, the seventh is forgetfulness. He grinned ear to ear and started to dance around.Michael shrugged.Fine.Ill admit guilt to all of those.Except the masturbating, God is really a stickler about that one.

Perfect! The demon waved his hands again and seven hula hoops appeared on the ground.Now jump Michael.Jump through my hoops.

Michael couldnt believe he was performing the demons request.He jumped, one through seven, in and out of the hoops.The demon, satisfied, then snapped his fingers, and Michael passed out.When he awoke he found God staring down at him.How was it? God asked.Well.It was a hell of a lot better than Hell, but I would sure as heck say Hell could learn a lot from Heck.

God looked away and sighed.Jesus fucking Christ.
