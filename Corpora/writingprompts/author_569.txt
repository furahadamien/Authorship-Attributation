'My #1 Dad mug I got you for me for Christmas has changed!''So' Stan quipped back


'I'm not #1, don't you see what this means?''...no' replied Stan


*Randy ignoring Stan's confusion keeps going*

'Do you think it's cumulative... like of all fathers alive, or total fathers that existed?*The mug changes to now say #1612578669*


'GAWW, downs seven more!'Yelled Randy


'Dad I'm having some trouble with this science question, the hardest mineral is -'


'I mean, I'm a great father, #1, the best!'interrupts Randy

'BAHH!'Randy blurts out, 'That's it, I'm going to find whoever this #1 guy is and show him just how great a father I can be!'*Randy storms out of the house*
