*A little late, and maybe this thread is already dead.But I got into it and haven't even finished, but I thought I would post this far.*

"It's amazing how fleeting it all is.How quickly and arbitrarily it can all disappear.Nothing in this world appears more concrete, more continuous than ourselves.Which is why, when it ends, so many of us are taken by surprise."Frank sat outside his office building enjoying a tuna sandwich and bowl of fruit.He was so proud of himself.Since he started packing his own lunches he stopped spending money on the solidified disks of grease they sold at the burger place in the food court next to his building.Just one more good habit he'd finally established.All his life he wanted to be fit and healthy.He wanted to live a long life, marry the perfect person, and, most of all, see humans reach Mars.It had taken him 32 years to feel confident that he could achieve these goals.Last week, His doctor told him he was the definition of "healthy".With 30 minutes left of his lunch, Frank decided to spend 20 of it meditating before he returned to his office.The director of human services, his immediate boss, would be retiring soon (at the ripe old age of 72) and they would be considering who would replace him.Frank had to be at his best.That meant top of his game, collected, and radiant.He let himself fall back against the park bench and closed his eyes.He let his thoughts drift for a moment before focusing on the sounds around him.The fountain in front of him splashed and gurgled.A group of boy scouts were practicing archery at a makeshift range on the edge of the park, away from everyone else.And a few others dressed for meetings were chatting on opposite benches.The fountain made the boy scouts yelling and the adults conversations inaudible, but Frank heard them all as a dull roar pierced with by the occasional sharp laugh of a 12 year old boy.Then a sudden and chaotic cluster of  screaming just before the onset of a sharp headache right above Franks right eye."Great," thought Frank, "another migraine," as he drifted off.Frank awoke with a start and found himself laying on the same park bench.Somehow he managed to curl up like the derelicts he saw on these same benches early in the morning.And just like a bum after a long night of drinking away his alms, Frank rolled from the bench with a groggy headache and an unstable certainty where he was.It was the same bench where he sat what seem like moments ago, but now it was dark and all the people were gone.Then he noticed the fountain wasn't running.How odd, he was certain that it ran all night long.It must've broken.Then, panic hit Frank at the base of his gut and he thought he might vomit.It was dark.He'd fallen asleep.He slept through the rest of work.Surely everyone would've noticed he was gone.How could he explain this?Would anyone believe him?Did anyone he knew see him sleeping out here?Frank frantically started reaching for his phone.It was gone.His wallet.Gone.The pen he kept in his shirt pocket?Gone."For fucks sake," he thought, "not only did I fall asleep, someone took everything I had on me".At least he had his shoes.What about his job?Frank sat for a few minutes with his head in his hands and breathed deeply.What's next?He couldn't return to the office without his I.D.and he couldnt take a bus without change.There was no other option.He would have to walk two hours to his apartment, cancel cards and file a claim on his phone, then decide if he was going to return to work tomorrow or just resign via e-mail.But when he stood to leave he realized something was different.Yes, this was the same park, the same fountain, the same nearby trees.But as his awareness stretched passed those immediate familiarities he noticed an unsettling silence out of place for this park.Where was the usual city cadence, the horns, the yelling, the barking, the pigeons, the crickets, the wind?It was so silent Frank could feel every increase as his heart began to fill the silence.He turned around to face his office building and it's total absence caused him to stumble backwards towards the fountain.He looked to his left and right and saw that all the buildings so familiar that he never noticed them were now gone.Their absence presented a stronger influence than their presence ever had.He turned and deposited his tuna sandwich and fruit into the empty fountain."Nine outta' ten kiss Ralph upon arrival," a familiar voice suddenly spoke behind him.Frank threw himself around and looked up.A man slightly older than Frank wearing a gray pinstriped suit, a black fedora and chewing a long cigar stood looking down at Frank with a knowing grin spread across an oddly familiar face.He reached out his free hand and pulled a befuddled Frank to his feet.Frank stared at the man who, for some reason, he felt as though he knew as well as his own father."Come on son, let's get you settled."Frank followed absently, never taking his eyes off the familiar stranger."Wh- wh- what happened to the city?Did I sleep through a war or something?""Uh oh, you're an unexpected arrival.Here, sit back down.Ya' smoke?"The man asked, pulling out a silver antique cigarette case from his inside pocket.Frank waved it away and shook his head.The stranger took the cigar from his mouth, licked his lips and said, "I've been at this for 60 years now, and it's usually best to shoot straight.You're dead son.Taken off the payroll, dearly departed, etc.And judging from your face, your clothes, and your not knowing, I'd say it was unexpectedly.I wasn't at the latest flick, so I missed the details."Frank stared in silence, his mouth slightly agape.He couldnt be dead.He was just sitting on a park bench in perfect health.This had to be some kind of scam.This man was dressed like and talked like Al Capone.And sixty years?How could that be, he didn't look much older than forty.Frank's courage swelled, he turned sharply to the man and opened his mouth."Look son," the man cut him off, "I know what you're going to say.We all say something similar.Look it.This is where you died, but beyond this area it's gone.Unless you think you manage to survive some commie nuke, how'd you think those buildings went?And take a look at me?Seem familiar?I should, because I'm the you that lived and died around 1958.Probably don't see it right away seeings I got a few years on down the road than you did.Any idea what happened to ya?"Frank turned and vomited again into the fountain.The stranger took a long drag of his cigar and exhaled slowly."Nine outta' ten."he sighed.After a few minutes Frank recovered and the two of started walking.Frank asked to where, and the stranger ignored him."Ya' see son, I'm giving you the answer to that big ol' question eatin' everyone up back on earth.Not sure I'd call it a heaven, but it turned out those bald robe wearin' fellas in India were closet.Ya die and you come here and another of us is born.We get deposited here.Don't know why, still waiting to see if it ends.What those chantin' fellas didn't get right was, we don't ever come back as crickets.Nope, just people.We basically got our own city here.You'll see."
