"Hello, What can I do for you?""I'm here to see Atomic Crusader.""Oh, how sweet.You must be a fan.I like your costume, by the way.It looks great!""Thanks.I made it myself.""I'm sure he'd love a visit.Just be mindful if he falls asleep.Let a nurse know so we can move him to bed.We take good care of that man.He's in room A24.It's down that hallway there and then take a left at the end.Here, just sign in on the log."He signed in with his false identity made for this purpose.Henry Holcomb.It was his original name, before the shifting series of names, fronts, shell corporations, and endless amounts of paperwork had obscured him for decades.He paid taxes under this name, had a retirement account, and subscribed to three magazines.It was a carefully cultivated lie.It was iron clad if anyone from the police to the United Nations should look.It was only transparent to one person, who had known his name many years earlier."Give it up, Green Error!""That's the Green Terror!""It's actually Henry Holcomb.Here, let me show you something."The Atomic Crusader lifted the Green Terror high into the sky."I've just destroyed the wiring of your suit, by the way.When you untangle it at home, you'll find it's been transformed into spaghetti!Ha ha!"The Green Terror wiggled his toes, testing the switches in his boots, but to no avail.His suit was suddenly unresponsive.Down the hall, then left at the end.A courtesy knock, probably unnecessary."Robert?""Yes?Oh, is that you Henry?""Yes sir.I thought I'd drop in for a hello.""Well, pull up a chair, kid.Have some lemonade.They make a pitcher every afternoon.I'm happy to share."Henry, aka the Green Terror, sat and humbly accepted a glass of very sweet lemonade.He always did."Hey kid, dya remember when you stole that truck full of lemons?That was a real laugh riot!""I do!I had forgotten about that.I'm not even sure I was gonna do with all those lemons.Probably try to sell them on the black market.That was a harebrained scheme."He left it himself, and his young and eager hubris, sometimes woefully misguided."Who would buy lemons on the black market?"They both laughed."See that, Henry?You can see all of New York from up here, as well as parts of Connecticut and New Jersey.Do you know why I brought you up here?""Are you gonna kill me?""Oh no, ha ha!Look!"Atomic Crusader's eyes glowed white.The planet below, lit by moonlight, changed.The land was gone.A vast ocean churned beneath them."What did you do?What the hell happened?""I erased the land masses of planet.Actually, I altered them so they were all below sea level.A lot of the geology is the same, though a lot of mass has been taken away.I also had to add lots of water.The whole thing took nearly three microseconds.And you like to rob banks!!Hahahahahaha!It's hilarious!"The planet below changed back to it's former self.Atomic Crusader started lowering down to the lights of Manhattan."Are you like a god?Why even bother with the costume?""It's more fun this way.It has been for a long time.""How long?""Before I was Atomic Crusader, I was just a kid named Bob Theriuault.Before that I was a man named Robert Thierry.But most people knew me as the Emancipator.""That was like 70 years ago!One of the masks of the Civil War!""Yes, and before that I was Minute Man.I've also been called Privateer Black, the Mason, and a bunch of other names.I once fought under Boudicca, and once for Alexander, who actually did conquer the world once, but then he went mad and started killing people en masse.I changed things so that he died young.Such an arrogant man.""No one will believe me, will they?""No one.If you tell, I'll just change it so that you never did.It's okay.Keep robbing banks, Henry.Just don't ever kill anyone.And if you ever do by accident, let me know immediately.I'll help."They landed on a very tall building."Where am I?""The Empire State Building.One minor change.It's got a great view.So long!""I never robbed another bank, you know.""I know.I was the guy who used to chase you.You specialized in colorful but relatively benign pursuits.Your costumes got more and more ridiculous.""My seventies one was the worst.It was a green leisure suit, but I had so many gadgets inside, it was five sizes too big!""You did look like a kid trying on his father's suit.My favorite was your 1955 look.Cape, domino mask, and it wasn't even apparent you had gadgets inside.I appreciated the effort.""I played my part."The Atomic Crusader looked wistful.He sipped his lemonade."Henry, I'm dying.Well, not really, but they're going to find my corpse here one morning.I'm going to have to move on.""Oh.You're going to make yourself look younger?""Oh it's not just looks.I have to reconfigure my body.I will look very different.It's been fun.You made for a great nemesis.""Do you want me to attack your funeral?I could hold Silver Squad hostage?Those young guys are arrogant.They're all bullets and swear words.They lack imagination.""Ha!Hahaha!Follow your heart, Henry!"
