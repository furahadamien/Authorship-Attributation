Big Sally sat across the massive oak table.Her arms crossed.Hair net still tight.Cigarette in one hand.Spatula in the other.So entrenched into her image these things, that even death could not take them.She sat like an angry Valkyrie.Odin shrunk down while reading the tablet of Big Sally's deeds.High Queen of the Lunch rush.Undefeated in over 1000 dinners.Able to create food almost at will from government supplies.Known for their unending warmth to some, and undeniable cruelty to others.Odin looked towards the spatula.Its edge razor sharp.Its steel bright.Handle slightly deformed from Big Sally's grip.Odin slowly turns to an advisor, unsure of Big Sally's placement in the afterlife.As he turned he heard the voice of Big Sally."Will you hurry up.I get to get the potatoes peeled" a voice akin to a mountain falling into a gravel pit, but oddly warm and motherly.In that moment, Odin knew he could not deny this warrior, but mostly out of fear.
