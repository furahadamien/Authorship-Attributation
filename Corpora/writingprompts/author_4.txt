In the December dusk, the bubbles of light around the street lamps, whirling with specks of sparkling ice crystals, looked like oversized snow globes.I want to capture the street outside, Adolf said.Where do I start?Atmosphere?Lighting?A blitz of color?

You start by not painting, Bob said.First you need to understand.You start by thinking.

The young aspiring artist flipped his hair to the side, narrowing his eyes.Careful deliberation is the key to a great painting, Bob continued.Remember; every stroke of the brush has consequences.

So, I start simple? Adolf said.The falling snow!

Bob ran a hand through his thick hair and took a deep breath.That is a good place to start.A snowflake is one of Natures most beautiful creations, he said.Theyre all made out of the same water, but every snowflake is unique

I think I get it now, Adolf said and made a few quick strokes across the canvas.The canvas is the province of my expression.It is a domain that I, alone, control and shape to fit my unique ideas.

Bob shook his head and stopped the eager hand of the young artist.Your brush is a coryphe, and the canvas is a stage of white ice.The stage belongs to the art, not the artist, Bob said.So, I need to pour my mind onto the canvas, Adolf said and made another series of quick strokes.I need to get it all out, and not consider my desires!

Bob leaned over and plucked the brush out of young mans moving hand mid-motion.Wrong; your heart is your most valuable consultant, Bob said.Thats why you cant rush.Some ideas are better left unexplored.Each color and stroke have to feel right in your heart.If your strokes are too fast and too many, your heart wont be able to keep up.

I think I finally get it

Certain that he had taught Adolf the value of constraint and diversity, Bob Ross returned to his own time.On the way to the kitchen to grab a snack, he noticed that something was wrong with his world globe.The place that had previously said Europe now had big capital letters spelling GERMANY.What the hell Bob mumbled and grabbed his history book.*Due to his icy restraint and meticulous planning, Hitler avoided a war on two fronts, taking his time to first defeat France and Great Britain before attacking Russia.Modern scholars have placed Hitler among iconic conquerors such as Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan, and named him The Artist of Warfare.*

"You cant wear that," Inorai said, and her eyes narrowed in disapproval.I looked at my dress and wedges and then back at my assistant.She shook her head, her eyes now focusing on the digital clipboard.Id hired her as soon as I found out that well, I was an *empress*.I let out a giggle.That word still sounded too funny."Im not doing it."She looked up, her dark eyes as stern as the ginger hair knot on her head was tight."What do you mean?You have to.""As the ruler of this galaxy, I have no obligations other than"

"Okay listen, Blaire, you know thats not true.You have more obligations now than ever.You need to talk to your people.You need to establish trust.And nobodys going to trust an empress who dresses like a cheap Molarian.""Youre fired," I said, pouting."Right now, Im your best friend, and I have years of experience in..."

She kept talking, but I zoned out and paced over to the balcony.Below, the evergreens shot up over the oily black solar panels of the city.The long ponds mirrored the pale blue sky before cascading down to the next level of Azure Dome.From up here, you couldnt even see the lowest levels of the capital, and the sewers where Id grown up.It was strange to me how well the suffering was hidden.One could probably live out their entire life here without ever even having to think about the scum."and besides, youre the one who has to lead now.Its not like you can just shrug off all the responsibilities.Are you even listening?"Inorai threw up her hands in frustration."Fine, Ill do it," I said and dropped the dress that she had referred to as cheap, even though it cost more than a years salary on my previous job.She gasped and politely covered her eyes to my sudden nudity.I imagined her to hold the same pose with her hand shielding her eyes when she was forced to visit parts of the city below level three.Disgusted, I started wriggling into the skintight outfit of polytryazic silver.It wasnt right that there were clothes more expensive than cities."Youre actually going to?"she said after a while."Yes, I told you.""Right, great!I, uh, okay.A couple of things about manners and the way you carry yourself in public from now on" she droned on.I sighed and started putting the strange ribbon crown into my hair.Shed wanted me to hire professional fashionistas and makeup artists, but really, somewhere you had to draw the line.I took a look in the mirror.The crown looked like the ribbon on a present wrapping and doodled in strings of mercury down my black hair.I made an ugly grimace at my reflection who didnt seem very pleased at seeing me either."Whats our closest galaxy?"I said."That would be The Milky Way.""Who lives there?""You have to know that."She gave me a look of disapproval."Thats where we once came from.""Right, I was just kidding," I lied.She rolled her eyes."Are you ready for the broadcast?""Yes"

She handed me the tablet, and it showed a hand imprint.I placed my palm on it and felt a sting on the tip of my index finger as it scanned my print and took my DNA key.A counter on the screen started ticking down.When it hit zero a tiny replica of me rose out of the screen, and a box with red neon letters said Live Broadcast.

"Greetings, citizens of Andromeda," I said, pulling my voice into a haughty tone."I am speaking to you for the first time as your Empress."I let my words hang in the air for a while for effect, just as Ive practiced."We are different people on different worlds with different religions and culture, but we share one thing.Every child no matter of social status has been taught that we, the Andromedians, are the greatest.We know this.Its in our bones and blood  in our souls.Thats what I was told when I shoveled dirt and filth down in the sewers.Thats what youve all been told."I paused again and took a deep breath."Starting now, were no longer a civilization of peace."I heard Inorai gasp behind me as I broke script."Were going to put it all to the test.Well start by conquering The Milky Way, and from there on, the rest of the universe.I will lead us into a new era."***

The windswept waste calls out to me at night, weeping and howling like a hungry beast.The barren fields and empty streets eat the strongest of men down to the bone.Little is as it once was.The gray sky, hurling its gastric acid over the countryside, twisting the trees and vegetation into nightmarish swamps.The slouching street lamps sprouting from cracked flowerbeds of tarmac.The ruined cities of a world flushed down the drain.They say that time heals all wounds, but those prophets of the old knew little of the carcass we now call Earth.They knew nothing of the roaring trucks of the meat farmers and the shrieks of their shackled slaves.They knew nothing of the rabid men hiding in cellars, ready to spring out and tear into your flesh, happy to infect anyone with their disease.They knew nothing of the struggles and the temptation of death.They had no idea what it's like to salivate into a dry mouth at the mere thought the parcel in the back of my satchel.With a deep breath, I rush out of my hiding spot.Crossing the street, covering my face from the corrosive rain, praying that the eyes of the city are gazing elsewhere.Zigzagging through a graveyard of rusting cars, jumping across the yawning fissures in the ground.A sudden creak of metal sends a shiver down my back and my heart into overdrive.From under the skeleton of an old school bus, a chromium arm reaches out.Unharmed by the rain, it whips to and fro, trying to grasp anything, catching the shoulder band of my satchel."Wasn't it enough that you set this world on fire, huh?"I hiss at it through gritted teeth as we engage in a brief tug of war.In the back of my mind, I know it's a lost cause.The satchel is as good as gone.My few possessions, lost.Groaning, I let go of the band and reach into the satchel one last time as it skids across the ground, pulling out the parcel before everything disappears into the darkness below the bus.With an aching shoulder and sweat dripping down my face, the shadow of the building on the other side of the street finally swallows me up.Covering my mouth, I force the coughing fit back down my throat again.The bleak dawn climbs up over the horizon.My time is running out.Swallowing my breath, I tiptoe through the filth, my eyes searching through the corners.There she is, curled up into a ball next to an old garbage container.Her dark hair covers her face, and for a moment I'm worried that she's dead.That she's finally given up.But then she sighs in her sleep and rolls over.The dark locks fall to the side, revealing her hollow cheeks, streaked by tears and lined by misery.I tried to approach her once, but the world has dug its claws into her frail body and mind.She's scared of everything, and rightfully so.She was so young when the bombs fell.Far too young to live in this world.Slowly, I pull out the parcel, and the intoxicating smell of chocolate fills the air.Even in her sleep, she reaches for it, takes it out of my hands.Our fingers almost touch... almost.She hugs it to her small chest, just like a child would their favorite stuffed animal.For a moment, I watch her sleep.The lines in her face smoothen themselves out.Her expression is peaceful, and that gives me peace.Knowing that her stomach will be full another day is what keeps me going.I used to tell myself that it was my duty to deliver them to her -- she did win the golden ticket -- but over the years I've come to realize that I do it as much for me as I do it for her.Seeing her thin lips curve into a tiny smile reminds me that there's still beauty left in this world.Her smile is the only thing that keeps me sane.***

Cries of help bounced up the dirty concrete walls and through the rusty fire escapes.Thick drops of acid rain fell from the gray, polluted sky, pattering against my umbrella.It took a last drag and stubbed out my cigarette.The alley was like any other in this godforsaken city  windowless, filled with garbage containers, and with graffiti like old fading tattoos.Popping the holster open, I placed my hand on the wooden grip and strode into the alley.Cornered at the very end of the alley, a dainty dame was fending off a small leathery attacker with wide swings of her vanity bag.She was a real looker too  plump in the right places, a dolly face framed by streaks of golden hair, and long, lithe gams wrapped in dark nylon.I glanced at the tiny leather creature on the wet ground, bouncing up and down, yelping and growling.This was the third one Id come across this week.Disgusting little critters with razor sharp teeth  theyd rip you right open in your sleep.Carefully, I pulled out my roscoe, opening the reserve box  two slugs ought to be enough.Maam, step away from the wallet.

She glanced at me, her blue eyes wide in terror.She was a green one  some upper-class bim, lost on the wrong side of the train tracks.She took a step back, almost tripping over one of her shoes that she had dropped in the battle.Two quick ones.The loud echoes climbed the walls.I spun the revolver around my finger and placed it back in the holster.The heel of my boot came down on the smoking remains of the wallet.Thanks, she mumbled and crouched down, strapping her shoe back on, and then started to pick up the items that had fallen out of her bag.Breeze, I said and nodded at the street.This aint no place for frails and old men.

She managed a scowl despite her shivers and dripping wet face.Do you mind? she asked, looking expectantly at my umbrella.Uh-huh, I muttered and started lighting a new cig.Please?

I took a drag, shrugged, and then shifted a couple of feet toward her, covering her from the rain.Even through the smell of my cigarette, I caught a whiff of her expensive perfume.You smoke?

Gods no, she said and finally got up.Can you take me to Caledonia Plaza?

Do I look like a flivver chauff?

You look like a criminal, she said briskly.And you, like a dish  whats your doings in Low York?Long way from home, arent you?

She didnt have time to answer before another cry rang out from across the street.I cursed through my teeth, which made her wince.I put the umbrella in her hand and emptied the used shells of my roscoe in the gutter.Dont you dare run off with my umbrella, I muttered and crossed the street while reloading.Son of a bitternut grifter  Id have to pay a visit to Masperoni after this.****

On a pale horse, Death galloped into the world, his cloak burning behind him like black fire, and his scythe gleaming with the sharpness of inevitable demise.The last of the five to enter the mortal realm."I've come to harvest the souls of this world."Death's hollow eyes wandered over his siblings."I trust you've all taken great strides to pave my way?""A global conflict is knocking on the door," War said, lifting her helmet and shaking out her fiery locks."Through the apocalypse, I will ride by your side, brother.Just give me a little more time... it will happen!"Death nodded."I was hoping for more... Actual battles, men at each other's throat!Swords and blood!Smoke and fires!At this rate, maybe there won't be an apocalypse..." 

War hung her head."I've really tried!But these blasted nuclear weapons just sit there... creating this... this... abomination called a 'cold war.'"She spat on the ground for emphasis.Death sighed, shifting his unblinking gaze over to his younger brother."You've also been struggling, I can tell," he said, his hollow voice ripping across the dusty plains of Armageddon."Everyone keeps stuffing their face with sugar and fat!How am I supposed to starve a world where everyone's overweight!"Famine cried in frustration."Seriously, these mortals aren't even trying anymore.There's always that extra bag of chips picked up at the store, and that infernal fast food business.Seriously, those pizza delivery guys outrun my horse."Death's face darkened under the cloak.He turned to the fourth horseman."Well, what about you then?""I just have one word for you.Antibiotics," Pestilence said, flies buzzing around him."What am I supposed to do?I can spread diseases all day, but nobody freaking dies from them anymore!They have a cure for everything these days.I'm starting to feel impotent... kind of like War for the last five decades.Anyway, just give me some more time, I'm working on resistant bacteria..."

War glared at him but said nothing.Death tightened his skeletal knuckles around the grip of the scythe.He'd hoped for an easy harvest.A quick reaping of the world.Reluctantly, he turned to his youngest brother."What have you been up to?"Eyes-wide, Ignorance looked up.His big brown eyes nervously flicked across the others.His mouth hung slightly open.He cleared his throat, fixed his tie, and ran a comb through his hair."Well?"Death said, impatiently snapping his bony fingers.He wasn't expecting anything.His youngest brother had always been unreliable, at best."Hey, I'm talking to you!"Death said when he noticed that the short chubby man wasn't paying attention.Ignorance looked up again, and this time pointed at himself, looking like a big question mark."Yes, you.What have you been up to...*brother*?"Death said.Ignorance swallowed and pointed at his phone."You've been on your phone?"Death clenched his jaw.Not much of a surprise there.The man nodded nervously."Give me that," Death said, and snatched the phone out of his hands.He was just about to toss it into the desert when he noticed something on the screen."Who are all these people?"Death tapped on the phone."Followers?You have a cult?"Ignorance nodded."Interesting..." Death mumbled."Facebook... Twitter... Instagram... and all you do is post memes and cat pictures?"Ignorance looked at his feet."Wait, there's more," Death rumbled."Huh... you've been sharing highly dubious articles... anti-vaccine... homeopathy... conspiracy theories... wait, how did they get this many Likes?"Ignorance shrugged."Okay, listen up!"Death said, turning to the others."I'll give you some more time to get your act together and prepare the world for my arrival.We'll postpone the apocalypse for now."They all looked up in surprise and relief when Death turned his horse around."We'll discuss the logistics in greater detail," Death said and pulled out his own phone, following his little brother on social media."Until my return...Ignorance is in charge!"***

Okay, here we go, June said, spinning the wheels on her mechanical glove, which sent her on a dizzying ride through space and time.She landed in a pub buzzing with activity, colorful bottles lined the wall behind the bar and yellow light radiated through heaps of stacked cups.Women in long dresses and updos danced to the live tunes of a jazz band, while the bartender idly polished the counter.June made her way through the thick vapors of cigar smoke towards one of the quieter corners of the pub.A man in a black suit and hat sat alone in a booth, swiveling cubes of ice in what undoubtedly was a glass of scotch.Fashionable as ever, he noted, raising his glass unenthusiastically at June.Well, its not like I had time to change, June said, looking down at her wrinkly renaissance dress.Time, sure. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his chest pocket.Want a smoke?

Come on, Roman, June said.You know I dont smoke, and besides, weve got important things to do.

Important, right. He said, inhaling deeply.Ah, thats the stuff.

Why dont you start by giving me an update?

Roman leaned back, regarding her with an amused look.Why dont you start by sitting down for a moment, Sweetheart?

June felt like kicking him.This was why she hated the fifties.Roman basically turned into a Philip Marlowe with an impossible reluctance to cooperate.Fine, she said, with a resigned sigh.Buy me a drink.

Buy your own drinks, Roman said, yawning.You know, I like you way better in the seventies.

Its the hair, isnt it? he said, winking.Tell me one thing, Roman, June said, snatching away the cigarette he was just about to light.If I were one of those dainty women over there  one of those swooning helpless things, without a hint of independence  would you help me if I came running to you?

Swooning, huh? He emptied his scotch.If I remember correctly, back in the 16th century 

Yeah, yeah, I couldnt handle the corsets, whatever, she said, rolling her eyes.What would it take for you to give me the damn update?

How about you get out of that moldy old dress and get the next round? Roman said, nodding at his empty glass.I havent seen those lovely butt cheeks since Leonardo painted Mona.

Why did I marry you back in the Antiques, I simply dont see it, June said.I think it was the hair.

You know, I was going to give you the night of your life, but I guess youll have to wait until Zeppelin releases their first album, I mean, its only another twenty years.

Im sure itll be worth the wait, Roman said and got up.Until then there are some swooning ladies by the bar, who appear to be in need of my immediate help.

June cursed through her teeth and watched him strut over to the dance floor.Be that way, she thought and spun the wheel on her glove again.
