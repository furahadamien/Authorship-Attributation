I looked down at the paper in my hand and sighed.My mission, as the visions had explained, was to save humanity.The problem was that to save humanity, I had to kill them.Personally.Strapped to my side was a dagger made of a material I could not identify.It felt like stone, but was as resilient as the hardest of metal alloy man could produce.With this dagger, I could kill a person, and save them.Doesn't make a bit of sense, really, but I knew in my heart, it was true.The visions, or messages, or whatever you wanted to call them were definitely real, and what I had seem in them had shaken me to my very core.Oh, yeah, that's the other big thing you should know, I'm the only one in the world that knows that the Earth and all it's people are doomed.What a nice burden to have, don't you think?It's a ton of fun I tell you.Oh, the dagger, you probably want to know how I got it and how I started to get the visions.It's a short tale, since it happened all at once.On a day like any other, I got a ring at the door, and barely caught the sight of the delivery guy jumping into his van and speeding off.He had placed box not unlike those your shoes come in on my doorstep.I didn't remember anything I had scheduled for delivery recently so I read the label carefully.It was hand written, clearly listed me as the recipient, and was from someone who was an old acquaintance, a martial arts trainer I had worked with some years ago.My curiosity was peaked and I cut the box open there on my doorstep with a small knife I had on my key ring.Inside, a piece of paper sat atop something wrapped in some sort of silk cloth.I read it and it said simply: "You are the only person I could think of that was worthy to have this."My curiosity grew tenfold and I quickly unwrapped the object and saw this awesome dagger that looked like it was a prop from the Lord of the Rings, except it was milky white.I grabbed the thing and at that point I guess I passed out and drooled allover myself on my door step as the next thing I knew I was being awoken by a neighbors dog as it licked my face, much to the chagrin of my neighbor who had spotted me.I told him I was fine and probably fainted from lack of sleep.That was of course a lie.I had been awake, just awake somewhere *else*.So yeah, that's the short of it.I passed out in front of my house and had a vision of the world ending and how I could save humanity.By killing them.Oddly enough the visions didn't tell my who I should kill.They sort of said I would know who naturally.As you could imagine, this drove me a bit crazy at first, but I think I have it figured out.This list in my hand, it's a very particular list.See, I don't have a lot of time to save humanity, a few years at most.A few years to plan the careful murder of some very notable people.People like this man in front of me."Hello doctor!I'm a huge fan of your theories.It's an honor to meet you!"I said with my best fan-boy enthusiasm I could muster.You see, I had decided the people I needed to save should be the best humanity had to offer.
