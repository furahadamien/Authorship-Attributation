Prime minister Scarblart sat in his blue office, head in tentacles, wondering what the fuck he should do.He was the 67th prime minister of the Astron, the largest of continents on his little green ball hurtling through space, that didn't really matter right now.Astron military and economy were unmatched on the world stage but that wouldn't save anyone, it had died.They had found it about 40 years back.A farmer had called his local police about a monster in her fields.Then as each saw it and ran it up the chain of command it soon became apparent that it was alien in nature.The world's best scientists examined the creature and the device it came with and expanded science and technology as we knew it.They also said one day it would die.The creature itself measures 3 metres tall and 5 from snout to tail.It was orange with black stripes down its back, skin was rough scales and it's mouth was filled with razor sharp teeth.The beast had some interesting characteristics, while it might look real it was only compressed light, a hologram and it could only move writhing a 10 metre radius of the device it came with.A small metallic disk, able to be carried with 1 tentacle, with buttons along the bottom and in the middle a projector.You used the device to care for the beast.Clean, feed, move and generally interact with it.There was even a mode to make it shoot fireballs but the device itself took an entire nuclear power plant to recharge.Now it was dead and whatever civilisation had created it would be coming for the.They had failed to keep it alive until their return.Scarblart was sure there was going to be a high price for failure.He would soon go out to a press conference and inform the public about the creatures existence and it's demise.They had failed and there was no point in hiding it anymore, the aliens would be back soon enough.There would be panic, riots, wars, the economy would collapse and they would be lucky if they didn't nuke themselves to the stone age.He stood and walked across to the press conference room, lackeys trailing behind.He would go down in history as the prime minister who got them into this mess but he would do it with his head held high.
