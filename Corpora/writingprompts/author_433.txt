*I got hooked on the premise and stayed up too late writing it and went a little bonkers.Sorry for muddy waters.*

His family explained it many times, when he was a child, how it was no one's fault in particular: the missiles already had targets and the people who turned the keys had no way of knowing.Phonecalls were made, jets scrambled, evacuations announces.Only a dozen or so went off.Just enough to make life awful for everyone, enough to salt the earth where conventional war hadn't already.There were too many grudges that needed to be settled.It was a botched lance.There was no relief.Infection set in.The sun stopped coming out.That was what did it, really, if anything was to blame.The famine took his family away from him.That's what he told the crowd at his inauguration.He was just like them.He worked with Civil Defense, like many of the people attending.He was there when the trucks ran out of gas, to help move medicine and food, as if such things existed anymore.He was not a hero, no, he was just the right man in the right place at the right time.He'd like to do that again as America's next Commander-in-Chief.If anyone clapped for President Gilbert's speech, it was inaudible, considering how many wore gloves.There were very few in attendance, given the recent flareup of diphtheria and the bitter cold that day; wind clawed at his face and forced it in to contortions similar to those produced by sucking on a lemon.His eyes teared up.His droopy frame attempted to right itself for the pictures no photographers could take.And in the back of his head, there was that gnawing sense that they could find out.That they would find out.They would find out what his mother and father did to get in to that bunker; that they would find out what he did to--

*POP!*

"... may I be the first to offer my sincerest congratulations, Mr. President..." The Secretary of State passed him a flute of champagne.Most of the room was blanketed in shadows, the windows frosted and the only source of light a construction lamp dangling from the cracking ceiling.There was enough to make out words on paper, people's faces, and the damage done by years of snow and ice to the interior of the Oval Office.The fimbriation along the flag behind his desk dangled across the stars and stripes in pathetic majesty.Cheers were sent up once everyone's glass was filled, and they echoed in the largely abandoned  West Wing.Someone coughed for about a minute.They gossiped for some time, his cabinet, most of them bunker babies like himself.They were the old guard, the last of the statesmen.Those born since the famine seemed to care very little for politics and restoration of order when the National Guard was robbing them blind and disease was rampant, not that there was any weight to the accusations.Such roadblocks were, however, expected and accounted for.How couldn't they be, if the call was going to do anyone any good?It couldn't without maintaining the peace.They talked then very much and now even more about the call and maintaining the peace, and how it would justify going so long with so little.It would make those who claimed the disbanding of the United Nations shortsighted, this being the only thing Gilbert's cabinet agreed upon.Yes, they defiantly stood by their nation's original conviction with the same energy as before it had all fallen apart, and it was exactly what America needed.'Now more than ever' was what they had printed on flyers, before the mimeograph broke.Once the champagne and cake was exhausted, and they had collected themselves in a circle on and around the stained couches in the center, the Secretary of Defense looked from the group to President Gilbert.She produced a sealed document from underneath her arm, and delicately placed it on the coffee table in front of him."Mister President, it's not my intent to spoil the celebration, but as we spoke about yesterday, this document contains the Normalization Protocol.You're familiar with most of it from those briefings, but, it contains information for your eyes only... please, take your time."The binding of the red ribbon that girdled the Protocol was brittle and its edges coiled.It fell apart with terribly little effort, and President Gilbert tread more slowly as he explored the folder.It took him almost an hour to complete it.The entire room watched him as he did so, the ceremony interruped only by constant pacing and murmurs and hushed conversation.Charts were consulted.Letters were drafted.An aide prepared a telephone in the background, escorted by two Marines in filthy uniforms.Paperwork had collected on every imaginable surface.Once everything was more or less in its place, President Gilbert seated himself behind the desk of the leader of the free world, and he pulled the telephone closer.It had no dial, only a faceplate where it would have been.He grit his teeth and  traced the wire from its fall off the desk, between the couches, under the feet of the Marines, and out in to the hallway.Presumably it was connected to the Slave Relay in Greenland.Presumably that Slave Relay was connected to the Master Relay in Bern.Presumably the cables between them all had not been severed and the nuclear generators that powered all of these overdesigned mechanisms had not failed.Presumably he would hear the confirmation tone every sixty seconds until another party answered.Sweat coalesced on his palm, in spite of the cold.It trembled.He paused."I'd -- I'd like the room to myself, thank you."No one budged, until the Secretary of Agriculture lifted himself up from a folding chair near the window and sauntered out.The rest followed suit, some craning back to look at the President, the rest down-turned, as if afraid they'd be turned in to pillars of salt.When only the two Marines were left, they tidied the cable in the crook of the doorway and sealed the chamber.The light flickered.There was a muffled commotion from somewhere else in the building, and a police siren went off a block or two away.Gilbert closed his eyes, breathed as slowly as he could given that his lungs were shivering and his body wincing.When he did exhale, it came out in machine-gun bursts of steam, like a backfiring Cadillac.His shirt was damp and his tie was too tight and *what if no one picks up?* 

There was a shout somewhere on the lawn.He picked up the receiver, ears ringing.There was a dial tone.My God, *there was a dial tone*.Sporadic gunfire.His pulse quickened, he clenched his eyes, and an inexorable force not unlike the one that made him pick up his father's rifle many, many years ago guided it to his ear.An indeterminate amount of time passed, the same time Einstein once wrote ebbed and flowed in fantastic and unreal ways, ways that made even a second not only feel as if it were an hour but in fact compelled it to behave as if it were an hour.Maybe it was the adrenaline.The tone persisted.It had to have been sixty seconds, but he refused to count.TEN FIFTY-ONE.*Beep.* INTERVAL 4-3-8-7-6-1-1-7.CODE 40.NO--

If he hadn't had looked up and realized the Federal Government's clock was off by a few minutes, he would have cried, but instead, President Gilbert laughed.Fifty years of no contact with the outside world would do that.Fifty years of mutual agreement to not speak to one another was enough to scare war out of civilization.Fifty years of invisible walls and cut wires.Fifty years to satisfy the conditions of the Second Nairobi Conference and produce a machine that would announce to the other leaders of the world on the call that Code 40 had been achieved.Everyone would be too busy to be exchanging food and toilet paper and gas and medicine and cigarettes to notice.There would be medals and ceremonies.He'd be a hero.Other countries must have made it.They must have what he could not provide.He did what he had to to survive.It was easier than you'd think.History would vindicate him."This is... this is the President of the United States of America--"

The gunfire peaked and crashed.A snow-caked window had shattered and through its empty frame were visible the Marines he had ordered out of the room, doubled over in crimson snow on the White House lawn.Flurries had already begun to collect on their uniforms.TEN FIFTY-FOUR.*Beep.* INTERVAL 4-3-8-7-6-1-2-0.CODE 40.NO MUTUAL OPERATORS.The receiver dangled over the edge of the desk.It dangled over the last President of the United States.The man with the assault rifle and the toeless boots who picked it up didn't know what Code 40 meant, and honestly it didn't matter.Continuation of government simply did not appeal to the younger demographic.They could not grasp the bigger picture; they always needed more than could be provisioned.They could not even be expected to find adequate shelter.It was a tough sell, civilization.Gilbert's campaign manager had stressed this.War could never happen again if there were no one left to commit it, and in this respect the Second Nairobi Conference was a complete success: a shining example of and eternal monument to what can be achieved through the goodwill of mankind.It was more than enough to eclipse the scandals that would later become associated with the GIlbert Presidency, and would have eventually captured the post-bunker-baby vote had they not shortly thereafter done to themselves what their government and those abroad had tried so desperately to prevent for fifty years.If it was anyone's fault to begin with, there was no one left to blame.
