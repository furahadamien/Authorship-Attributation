Havoola
New town.Small and quiet, perfect for my situation.The authorities are after me.They know what I am : different, a national threat.Theyre aware of what Ive done.If they catch me itll be prison or death, the fate of countless others like me.Stray dogs and playing children in the streets.Nervously, avoiding eye contact with the receptionist, I book a room at a guesthouse and try to sleep for a couple of hours but to no avail.I get up shower, put on some jeans.Head to the local bar to wind off.Clouds of smoke, full of loud men.Standing at the threshold, Im about to leave without getting a drink when she comes up behind me.Excuse me, are you getting in?



Perfect hair, perfect nose.She smiles uneasily on the first date, eyes darting stealthily towards the door of the French restaurant.On the second date, I channel a German tourist and she is bored by my stories of Berlin nightclubs and beer festivals.On the third - me as a lumberjack from a  neighboring town - this time she seems interested, eyes sliding across my bulging forearms and she even gives me a peck on the cheek but she doesnt reply my message the next day.On the fourth, she asks me to walk her home, and Im surprised because I, stammering and clumsy, had taken the form of  a skinny bespectacled bookkeeper, a complete loser, but her interest was at an all time high, giggling and all that, hand resting on my reedy wrist.She invites me inside.Small and clean place, curtains drawn tight.I sit on an armchair and try to calm my excitement: its a perfect time to show this beautiful woman the truth, before things got too heated, when she was least expecting it.Like so many others before her.I want her to see the real me.As she busies herself in the kitchen, it takes a second to take my true form: tall and gangly, scarred face: the legacies of many a manicured victim.I take out the little pocket knife and, approaching the kitchen where she is humming, hide it behind my back.

Tommy and I are dead to Spencer.Im Tommys only parent.I do everything with him.Hide and seek, playstation, movie night.Spencer obviously doesnt want another kid (right after the accident, to me in a venomous, tear-drenched voice: *Youre a horrible person and a horrible mother, Lisa*) so its up to me to make sure Tommy doesnt get lonely.Im like Tommys bigger sister: we have a handshake that lasts 10 seconds, I roll my eyes when he does something stupid (youre so annoying!), that sort of thing.I also play pranks on him, the biggest one being the Harry Potter one since he loved, no *loves*, Harry Potter.Its a bit cruelly elaborate but its something well laugh about when hes older, Im sure; one of our many memories together as mother and son.Ive told him hes a wizard (Hagrid voice!)and that everything is real, the train, the castle, the giant Squid.I even bought parchment and wrote an admissions letter: *Dear Mr Davis, It is my pleasure to inform you...*

Were at Kings Cross.Hes excited, face red with anticipation and Im rolling the mum camera.You have to do it at a bit of a run, puppy I say, taking a quick snapshot of him in his immaculate dark robes.This ones going straight on the mantle.Thats what it says in the book.

Beaming, he walks briskly away from me towards the archway, then does a light jog.Im beside myself at this point and when he begins to run I zoom in.And he disappears.And then reappears.Indignant: Mum!

My sides.My poor sides.People are staring (people always stare) as I double down, heaving with laughter.Theres nothing back there! He crosses his arms and fixes me with a glare that makes me laugh even harder.Uh yeah, thats the point, puppy! I exhale heavily and straighten up, tears streaming down my cheeks.There is no Hogwarts!

Urggh. Little scrunched up face, coming for me with his raised little fists, which I block with a big mum hug.Im gonna get you back!I kinda knew all along, though. He buries his face resignedly in my coat.Since Im a ghost in your head and everything.

A pause in which I hug him even tighter.Yeah.

Muffled voice in my coat: Wish dad was here.

I nod.Spencer hasnt spoken to me since the accident that I caused a year ago, the accident that killed our son.Me too, puppy.
