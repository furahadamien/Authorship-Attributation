"I don't know...I just got out of a relationship and need to figure out myself first.I think I'm just looking to be friends right now."That same line every time.What a pallid lie it was.I kept trying to imitate what I thought she liked and every time it felt like I had gotten closer, but it never stuck.We'd always end up taking this same stupid walk near her house and she'd stop by this same shitty bench and she'd say those same words, give a small hug and disappear into the distance.Ironic, for a man who could be anyone or theoretically do anything to end up in this Groundhog Day-esque scenario over and over.... and over.A few forms ago I got to a fourth date with her and we made out a bit, but she had stopped me and we had gone on this same walk in the end anyways.I slunk sadly back to my apartment, thinking about the disappointing night.My approach had gotten more refined- tattoos on arms, glasses, a little muscular but slim seemed to be the most consistent- and personality I hadn't gotten down yet either.Currently I was rotating through skin colors and hair texture to see if that made a difference.I don't think it did, really.I would throw something in from a few forms ago every now and then - large biceps and gym rat personality had gotten to a third date, but ended up as broken as all the previous ones.Nothing but those same words and that ridiculous sorry look on her face.Shutting the door once I was inside, I set myself down in my office chair and grabbed my camera, snapping a selfie on the old-fashioned polaroid and began taking notes on the back.I suppose my detailed process had forced the second room in my apartment to look a little bit erratic, sure.But I had to document my progress and notes on what seemed to have an effect and what didn't, I couldn't keep track otherwise.My walls were plastered with polaroids of my different forms, copious information about her and her preferences.I don't like feeling like a creep, but I needed her, and I needed her to need me.I went to my fridge, grabbed a beer and my newest notebook, and went back to my room to study.I was getting desperate.I kept trying to think of how to get closer, how to figure her out and get her to spill what exactly she was looking for in a romantic partner.I kept looking at my notes covering the walls, trying to figure out what I could do differently.And suddenly I had a thought.Maybe when I was a man I was just too intimidating... she did keep herself more veiled around them.Perhaps if I could approach her- just as a friend- she would come to share more with me over time, and then I could get it right later.I changed forms again.I knew she had that open art workshop on Thursday nights, so I spent all of Wednesday and late into the night practicing with my new voice to get every nuance down.When I arrived at the class, I could feel my heart beating in my chest.I hoped this would finally be the time she could learn to talk more with me, and hopefully in a few more forms I would have it down and I would finally be perfect for her.I tried to not look over, to be nonchalant for once.She stood there at the entrance with her easel in hand, quietly sipping on her coffee, and wandered over and took the empty seat next to me.She greeted me, I tried out my new higher voice and we talked on and off as we worked on our pieces, her asking me questions about myself with vigor.This was working, for once.I'd spend a bit more time getting to know her, then take that information and be the man she always wanted.But then I saw a look in her eyes I hadn't seen before.She smiled coyly."Wanna grab a drink later?"I mean, that did explain a lot, in retrospect.For someone who prided himself on being observant, evidently I missed this one.At the bar and several cosmos in, I was losing coherency as she told me story after story I had never heard.The tension between us was palpable...The woman I wanted and knew so much about was melting before me and flirting like never before.She finally suggested we head back somewhere more private...I said my apartment was just around the corner in my drunken stupor, and she dragged me out of there by my arm.This was it.I felt myself trembling as we barely sloshed home to my apartment.I kept stumbling.I don't think my alcohol tolerance had caught up to me in my smaller body now."Waitwait", I barely slurred out once inside my door, "Leeetme tidy up my bed, njust a second."I threw my clothes, trash and every other unkempt item in the room hastily into my closet, and went back out to get her.But she stood further up the hall, at the doorway to my second bedroom, looking inside and frozen in fear.
