It was a normal weekday for most people, as they got in their hovercrafts and made their way to work.However, it was anything but normal for me.The day before, I had become the last smoker in the world, as reported by almost every single news channel.I have never been a chain-smoker, smoking only when I had to pacify my anxiety.However, this made me go through two packs in about an hour.Suddenly, every billboard proclaiming the horrors of smoking became much more intimidating.Never had I thought I would be scared of the tiny warning printed on a cigarette pack.In my mind, I only thought of what would happen if my daughter and wife knew.I  had managed to keep my smoking out of my home and workplaces, smoking only when I went out for a beer in the middle of the night.This wasn't always so.Before the government officially banned smoking and started prosecuting smokers, I used to go over to a friend's place.However, my friend is now in rehab, and off nicotine as well.I was certain that I was healthy and in perfect state of mind and body, but after yesterday's news, I feel phantom pains in my chest, as if my lungs had decided to side with the authorities.Behind me was an open cabinet full of unopened cigarette packets, my stash.I had started hoarding as soon as I heard the news that tobacco was to be banned.I was so obsessed with the satisfaction of taking a drag that I would go to any lengths to retain it.As I sat back thinking about this, I opened another pack.As I took a whiff of the tobacco, I realised that they were right to ban tobacco.They were right to force me to quit.However, it was too late.I was in too deep.I suddenly had a bout of horrible coughing.A raspy cough that you hear in horror movies, that I barely recognised as my own.I looked down and saw my once white shirt stained red with the blood I had just coughed up.A tear rolled down my cheeks as I thought of my wife and daughter, while the grey wisps of smoke that held me so tightly in its clutches swirled around.
