"Well this is a bit excessive," I thought at first, "even for them."He was everywhere.After the first week, I named him Xavier.I don't know why, it just seemed to fit.He was a distinguished, handsome, and charming.Exactly the opposite of his target.It seemed like an odd use of apparently brand new tech, connecting every visible ad together to let an imaginary character follow me around.It didn't matter what ad.He was always there, getting his two cents in about my habits.The latest Audi commercial, showing a young couple driving along the California coast, "Son," he chimed in from the backseat, "not even this car would get you a woman."He had a line for everything.Viagra was "coming sooner than you think" and I couldn't even watch porn without him commenting that the local girls weren't really locals, and even if they were... well you get the point.The friends I still had, while not many, were growing impatient.Their ads didn't star Xavier, and he was sure to remind them that all I had to do was give it up and he'd go away for good.For whatever kind of software program he was, I thought, he was surprisingly inquisitive."How'd you know it was coming?"Xavier asked, referring to the mandated shutdown of all tobacco production.Truth is, I listened to a lunatic online on a hunch and used my life savings to purchase enough smokes to last the foreseeable future.But I wasn't about to start explaining myself to an ad.I never responded.And never planned to."Alright, I give up," I paused for a second and turned to see Xavier pressed up close to the inside of my TV screen, while an ad for Puppy Chow played behind him.He looked far less confident than normal."I'm begging you to stop smoking.It's the only way they'll let me go."It took me a second to process exactly what he said."Wait, what?"
