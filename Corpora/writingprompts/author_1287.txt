Eredol looked through the yellowed pages that documented the life of the woman who was, in his past life, his soulmate.It was such a blessing that he had stumbled across this book amongst the endless, twisting rows of bookshelves.There were so many books in the Eternal Library of Xyndith-Ghol, but there were so few ways for Eredol to hang on to the life he once knew.He savored every seemingly handwritten line in the tome, reliving those lost summer days when he and Linireth would sit by the lake of her parents' estate, exchanging love poems and playing music together.As his eyes scanned over the pages, reliving those glory days, he raised one thin, curved eyebrow.There were certainly many more mentions of a human servant boy in here than there had been in his own biography.He barely even remembered that the estate had employed non-elves, for he had seen scant few mentions of them in his own biography.As he read more about Linireth, however, it seemed to Eredol as though his wife had conversed with the lower class far more often than he had previously thought.The cracked pages of the ancient volume documented in excruciating detail every interaction between Linireth and a young human servant named Gerald.Every conversation, previously hidden behind closed doors but now exposed upon the pages in Eredol's hands, seemed to him almost like a blemish upon his wife's reputation.She was born from far too high a stock to warrant such lowly interactions with a human!Eredol's lip twitched.When he had first found his wife's biography, he hadn't expected to become so irritated.All he wanted was to lose himself in an age long past, to find some respite from the endless days (Years?Centuries?)of wandering through the impossible architecture of this nightmarish realm.And yet, here he was, reading about his beloved soulmate laughing joyfully with a pathetic human boy.Veins bulging in his neck, the High Elf closed the large, leatherbound volume, using a scrap of loose leaf paper to mark his place.He gingerly placed the book in his lap and took a long, deep breath.Perhaps he needed to meditate on this for some time before he would find the strength to return.He was almost to the part in Linireth's life when her husband had gotten involved in dark magic and suddenly disappeared.Eredol feared nothing more than what he may discover had happened to her after that.
