Gotham19
Theodore stabbed and slashed at every living thing in sight.The dagger was humble, a iron blade with a wooden handle.The murder was fun and exhilarating.The electric feeling of watching the soul of another person leave their body.Theodore loved it.He did not know that the dagger let the person live when they were dead, he just murdered for the fun of it.A hero in one and a psychotic murderer in another it was only when Theodore died by the humble blade that he found out that he, the man who killed for fun was a hero.He didn't like it, not one bit.
