Letra5
"Do you expect me to talk, goldfinger?""No Mr.Bond, I expect you to die."The moment that changed my life.I finally felt like someone understood me, only to be let down in the most brutal manner possible.Supervillains?I despised the term.Nothing but clowns running around playing cat and mouse with caped crusaders.There exists no true evil in this world anymore.It has not for centuries.Nothing but child-like, mischievous deeds, popularized by the media stirring a frenzy of fear.It makes my head hurt.To think that our plans could be foiled by a man in tights.Keep your technology, your faith, and your beliefs in goodwill towards mankind.They look up to Genghis, to Hitler, to Manson?They know nothing.The first two just wanted their name in pretty letters all over the world, and the third was a buffoon who couldn't handle something as simple as a drug.I do not want take over the world, I simply mean to change it.Mold it into the Utopia it was meant to be.I don't want to be it's leader, I am but a catalyst in the process.The media call out my name, claiming I hunger for fame.What would be the reason to hold someone hostage, to further this absurd bedtime story concerning good versus evil?I am simply disposing of the redundancies in the code of life.If it were up to me, nobody would know of my existence.It's easier that way.There are three kinds of people in this world: the enablers, the enabled, and the instigators.I comprise the third, the only one that matters.They say I'm a monster.They say I am heartless.I say I value efficiency, and I have work to do.
