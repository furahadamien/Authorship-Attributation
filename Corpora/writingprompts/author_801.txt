As he fit his key to the lock, he braced himself for the calamity that he knew was waiting for him inside the small apartment.But, for once, they all seemed to be relatively civil as he walked into the apartment.Sloth was playing video games with Envy, Lust was on her phone as usual, and Wrath and Greed were playing a game of chess so quietly intense that Pride felt that he would be pushed away by the atmosphere surrounding them if he tried to walk towards them."Hey Pride," Envy called over his shoulder, his eyes never leaving the screen as his character punched Sloth's over and over.Sloth didn't look like he was trying, but Pride knew better."Hey," Pride said as he brought in his arm full of groceries."Where's Gluttony?""In his room playing that MMO still.And that's ANOTHER pawn for me," Greed snickered as he claimed his opponent's piece.Wrath growled like a wounded animal, low and menacing.Lust looked away from her phone to look at Pride as he started putting away the groceries."Need some help there, handsome?"she asked in her usual sultry voice.And even though Pride knew she didn't mean it as a come on, it was just how she was, he still felt his heart rate increase from the brief attention."No, I got it," he said instantly, tossing the gallon of milk in the fridge."Typical Pride," she said in her singsong voice."Someone's letting this month get to them.""Look, I've told you all a dozen times this month, Pride Month has nothing to do with-"

"Does it though?"Wrath interjected, sharp and clear.He slammed a knight onto Greed's queen, who groaned as it was swept off the board."Don't lie to me.This was clearly your idea!""It's about the LGBT community standing up for what they believe in, which of course is a pridefulact, but it's got nothing to do with me.Wouldn't I take credit if I did it?"Pride said, and all six of the other sins, even Sloth, nodded as if this made sense.Finally.Maybe now they'll stop bugging him about it."I still think it should have been called Lust month," Lust said, turning back to her phone.She was swiping right on every face that came across her screen, both male and female."It just makes sense.It's more a celebration of choices in sexuality, right?""That's part of it," Greed admitted, "but I think it's more about awareness for them.Like 'hey, we're out the closet now bitches, look at us,' you know?So Pride month fits a little more.Plus humans are still a little too scared of talking about sexuality that openly to make a holiday for it."Lust smirked and held her phone up to Greed."Not online they aren't.And did you forget Valentine's Day, sweetie?""Must be nice," Envy said as his character was getting beat to a pulp by Sloth, who waited until his energy bar was full to beat him with a finishing attack."Humans won't ever dedicate a holiday to wanting stuff.""...Christmas?"Sloth asked, his word slurred.Envy smirked."Not the same thing.Christmas is about GIVING people stuff, not WISHING you had more stuff.But the aftermath of Christmas... now that's something I could get behind.What was that one movie, where the guy tried to make Christmas 2 a holiday?That's my shit right there," Envy said as they began the next round."Christmas belongs to ya boy here," Greed said."Also, check, old man.Try not to flip the board this time."Wrath growled under his throat as he moved his pieces into a defensive position, something he loathed doing with all his being."Sloth gets lazy holidays, like New Year's Eve," Pride said, and Sloth nodded slowly."What's Gluttony get?""Thanksgiving," all the other sins said simultaneously.Pride's cheeks burned."Nobody wants to celebrate me," Wrath chuckled, but even that sound had an inexplicable edge."Except maybe politicians and mafias.""That's true," Lust said."Honestly, baby, I think Wrath is more taboo than sex these days.It's not until wartime that you get any kind of boost, huh?"Wrath nodded as he slammed his queen onto the board, making the pieces bounce."Checkmate.""Pride, you can deny it all you want, but I still think Pride month is about you," Envy said."Nah.Veteran's Day, birthdays, those are me.Because they fit the original definition: a feeling of satisfaction derived from one's own achievements or from qualities that are widely admired.But these people fit a new definition that they made for themselves: confidence and self-respect expressed by members of a group, typically a marginalized one, on the basis of a shared identity, culture, or experience.""But they did it in your name!"Envy persisted."They celebrate the individual as a unit!That's the most Pride thing I've ever heard.""Pride is about the self!"Pride said, stomping his foot on the linoleum."It doesn't make sense to be prideful with others!""Easy there Highlander," Greed mumbled, and Pride rolled his eyes."I'm saying, it's a good thing," Envy insisted."Just quit being so damn stubborn and include their definition with your own, for once!Think of all that power you're relinquishing by not doing so!""You're right, it would be a lot of power," Pride admitted, "but it wouldn't feel right.Honestly...I feel like I'd be tarnishing something they worked so hard to make attaching myself to it."The other sins were thoughtful for a moment, shocked at this unusual thought."You're just upset you didn't think of it yourself," Greed finally said, and Pride threw a bag of chips at his head.
