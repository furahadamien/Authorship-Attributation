The hairs on my neck turned up.Stood.Erect."Excuse me," escaped my lips in a whisper."Your majesty, we have been trying to reach you for years, your window guard left you, sloppy work on their part if I may say myself, but nonetheless, here I am.What are your orders?We have a battalion ready to fly at a moments notice."My heart rate was skyrocketed, conflicting thoughts looped through my mind.Is this real?Has my mind been lost?For years, the messaging fed to me by my family had been nothing but lies.You're allergic they'd say.You can't be anywhere near bees they'd say.And my belief was with them.Hung on every word like it was dripping with truth but it had all been lies.My kingdom laid ready.My army foaming at the mouth, chomping at the bit to bring me back to glory."Kill them.""All of them?""All of them.""As you wish your majesty."A buzzing noise as loud as a Warhawk helicopter came almost instantly, the screams of the house keepers, of my sister, my brother, if you could call them that and my parents erupted in the air.My army devoured them whole, then came to me.They landed on the ground before me, too small for me to see, but their fealty could be FELT.My hand rose in a salute that existed in my bones.In my ear, the words grew as they were chanted, "All hail King Bee."
