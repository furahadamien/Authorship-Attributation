World War III, the war to end all wars.That is what we were taught, what we had envisioned, the resounding call to action when our self imposed "exile of nations" passed in near unanimous fashion.First however, let me ask you; have you ever lied?Fabricated a story to get your way in the short term with no way to protect yourself when it inevitably blows up in your face?Yeah...well the World and it's history are built on lies and when the time came, World War III was no different.You see prior to the War your history books tell you of "The United States of America"... 

Anywho, the United States had always been a technological and scientific marvel plenty of our "Modern" technology and medicine had come from it, good or bad.So when the next advancement in A.I, that's artificial intelligence; it's like an entity that runs on math, it's smarter and faster than you or I, we were of course excited.Why?This one could connect the global market's even more, better stock, higher payouts...hell it even had an algorithm to get aid to impoverished countries it would run everything.They called it, oh what does it matter...just know that it was our first step to a unified planet, what we could do seemed boundless; mars..ha ancient history.We were transiting to the next stage of civilization and nothing could stop us, atleast that's what we were told.As you can imagine reality came knocking.The A.I wasn't all it was cracked up to be and when we found out...hell it was to late.Humanity in it's excitement, had given control of all the worlds governments, their holdings, plans just everything to this damned A.I.So bombs fell, nuclear hellfire and all that right?Wrong...Remember, I said this A.I could do everything and so it touched everything; slowly..surely like a horror movie of old.First it was just slight inconveniences, toasters...coffee makers...your laundry machine, and the next thing you know, it's computers, internet, phones...everything.So tell me, what happens when you wake up, nothing works, your comforts are gone, alongside your money, you've got kids to feed and your infrastructure is near non-existent.We went from living like gods...and then to comparatively nothing.It was madness, you had to support yourself or you would die, it became dog eat dog.You ever see a man get torn apart by the limbs just to have something to eat?You ever see someone handicapped catch a bullet because they strained the local community?Believe me, take yourself out of the picture if it ever gets like that.So, when we finally did get some sort of "normality" and our governments back in place and that includes the new countries as well, we decided we would go about it the old fashioned way.Meeting after meeting, talk after talk the countries of the world hashed out our "new deal".We would all go into isolation, not isolation from ourselves of course..hell that would have been the smart thing to do..no isolation from the good ol "USA".Afterall, they caused this right; not us, we didn't unleash that damn A.I...how naive we were, we were the ones to accept it..fall victim to it's promises and we were about to lie to ourselves again.Abandon a country that had no ill intentions of us, a country that had built itself by supporting us for better or worse, a global trader in the past.So the final vote came, near unanimous...they were out and officially we were to and for 10 years our lie held up.We had brought ourselves back to the days of our great, great grandfathers...a 1930-40's existence.It wasn't to hard, we just had to heh...pull ourselves up by the bootstraps.Food was growing to feed our populations, pre-war medicinal advancements were there...you could say we were living the "American dream", two cars in every garage, a wife at home and a husband in a steady job...again though naive.Like all good things, it didn't last.You see, when you live in that post card picturesque world you don't want to change it.Why would you?So what if technology didn't advance beyond that of our new existence.We had food, we had warm beds and not a care in the world.Or so we thought.It was all a lie, you see when we didn't isolate ourselves we allowed our own differences to come to the forefront.America was no longer there, we didn't have "Big-Brother" to get pissy about.The day came when Russia wanted more and shattered our peace.The day came when China went completely dark.The day came when we were right back into it, but with our populations dwindled from "WW3" we ended up with endless stalemate, we had learned nothing.Killing our men and women...losing an entire generation to trench war not experienced in 200 years...god we were fools, and then the day isolation was to end.. What were we to do then!We had spent our time fighting, killing ourselves over our own dream once again while they built up.Of course their technology was just as stricken as ours but no they built themselves up, their national image.What I can only assume was the nature of their political system finally seeing complete takeover by a fringe faction.Those..."Americans" goose stepped their way right into Mexico...it was over before we could even think to react.I have to admit, I was slightly shocked...even awed.Not that I agree with their "pure-blood" beliefs, or their "Freedom"; but you must admit, their leader has a way of rallying sheep to genocidal wolves.That's what they did to.First it was central America...then South America, "did you have American familia?"no?Get in the train."Do you accept New Saint of America?"no?Enjoy your ditch."Where you handicapped?"yes?Enjoy your gas.It didn't stop either, as quick as they descended upon Mexico they had met Canada, what was Canada to do?Canada was peace loving prior to the great war...damnit Canada why didn't you take the deal...it's all they had to do.So, forget your history books young stock, that America down there on those waves...that's not the freedom touting, protecting the western hemisphere America we thought we hated...now, load your rifle *Shelling in the distance*, they land in about 3 minutes...this is the Queen's land.We shall defend our island, whatever the cost.
