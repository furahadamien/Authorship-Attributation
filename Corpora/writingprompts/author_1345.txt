Will that be all honey?  
Yes it will Margret i'll see you tomorrow same time as always Said Matthew as he gets up from the bar and starts to head out to his car.He opens the door to reveal the top of a skyscraper in New York city which is a little different from the sun kissed skies of the rocky mountains hes so used too.Again? Even tho Matt secretly loves see his lovely woman, even if she doesn't.Matt steps through the doorway to find himself on the edge of a building.What?Why are you up here Grace? Matt said with a quiver in his voice.I cant, I just can't live my life like this, every time i'm in distress you showing up She said with a crack in her voice .Wait, wait a minute Grace we can talk about this we don't need to make any rash decisions  up here Why don't we go back onto the roof and just talk this through? 
No!Matt either i'm jumping or you are i can't live like this, our lives are in ruins with each other popping up  seemingly out of nowhere 
Grace please, we can work this out, neither of us need to die for us to live in peace as tears start to form in Matthews eyes at the thought of losing her.Ever since the day they broke up Matt still loved her.Even as they drifted across the country Matthew couldn't find anyone who he could love the way he did for Grace.Unfortunately Grace never seemed to warm up to the idea of them getting back together.Grace i love you, i really do why can't you see that Matt crocked 
If you love me so much why don't you just kill yourself and make my life so much easier. 
Would it?If i wasn't around, would your life be that much better? 
Yes Grace said softly as if the words were sour in her own mouth 
Fine if me being here would make your life easier then i will
Grace climbed back onto the roof and waited for Matt to jump.For Matt life without Grace was torture, he thought if he moves somewhere beautiful and isolated he might be able to escape his feelings for her.When that stopped working, Matt started drinking like every heartbroken man trying to forget the sorrows of his life.Without saying a word Matt leaped off the building hoping that with him gone Grace would be able to live her life as normal a possible.Just as he jumped Grace just saw what she had done, all this time not believing the words Matt said to her.Like all thing you never know what you got till it's gone.Immediately Grace dropped to the ground crying seeing how just made the love of her life kill himself so she could be happy.He gave up his life so she could live.But now that hes gone she sees her true feelings for him but it's too late.Its never too late for love
Grace turns around and tackles Matt to the ground laughing and crying 
Matt, I love you 
I love you too
