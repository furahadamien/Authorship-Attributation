After I realized it, I froze.But, as I stare more and more at the newspaper all the way from 1940, I see a ring on my finger, that I found in an old drawer just weeks ago.I quickly search the old drawer again, hoping that the ring would open up my past, but it was gone.Several years have past, and my son comes up to me holding a strange thing in his hands.-Daddy!I found an old ring!-said the boy.The ring was quite rusty and old, and it had strange drawings on it so precise, that is impossible to do by hand.-Daniel!Give me those rings now!-No, Papa, they look really cool!Daniel put the ring on his thumb, because it would only fit there .The ring turned purple.Daniel, frightened quickly took the ring off and threw it in the river.His dad, Samuel didnt knew what to do, so he checked the old newspapers for any information.An article said: 

>The man has a ring on his thumb that stops anyone from shutting him down.When worn it was purple >,and scientists say that it might originate from ancient Egypt.A few days later, in that same old drawer he found a hidden compartment, but he had no key to open it.The drawer was made of wood so he brute-forced his way there, revealing a letter and a pill.>Greetings, Samuel.>

>I dont know if you will ever find this letter, and it might be better if you didnt.>You might have found a ring in this drawer.That was your ring, and it was your main source of power, >back when you were a supervillain.It might seem hard to believe now, that you dont remember >anything about it, but its sadly true.That ring was one of my greatest mistakes that I ever made.I >made the ring for you, because I wanted a companion.You were my best friend, but once you put on >that ring, you forgot everything and went on to dominate the world.I didnt realize what went wrong, >until recently.I made the ring too big, and you being foolish, put it on your thumb, and  magical rings >act weird when worn on a thumb.I know that you want to know more, but sadly I cant tell more.>

>However, the pill included gets all your memories back.Use it wisely.>

>Signature:Mindman.He was about to take them, but Daniel knocked on the door, saying:


-Dad, I found the ring, and I am wearing it!Samuel rushed to the door to get his son to remove the ring, but it was too late.The ring was already covered with a thick layer of matter, preventing it from being taken off.Daniel, who was by now controlled by the ring looked at his father, and erased all his memories.It was quiet after then only broken by the local newspaper seller shouting: Mindman is dead!
