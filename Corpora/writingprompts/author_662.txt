It's all over the news.The sadistic side effects of a drug which allows the consumer to stay young indefinitely.Anyone who opted to take it, which in all fairness was a lot of people, slowly started to go mad after 50 years of staying young.The mind couldn't keep up with the body.Cells regenerated at faster rates as people aged, to keep the body appearing young.The first incident occurred 2 years ago, although at the time it wasn't realised to be related to the drug.A man 4 years younger than me, with the appearance of an early 20 year old, started to develop ticks.Apparently he and his family put it down to work related stress.The pressures of daily life.Like he'd developed Tourettes.Subtle, at first.But then it quickly turned into something darker.He'd forget the names of his children.His wife.His friends and family.He'd then start cutting himself, all over, whilst laughing.Again, it was put down to stress, turned depression.He was eventually sectioned and that should have been the end of it.It wasn't.He didn't need help for any mental health problems.He didn't need help for any stress related problems.Some say it made it worse.That it antagonised him further.It was national news - he'd murdered his doctors and nurses, in varying gruesome ways.Some were even biblical.One of the doctors was hung upside down, arms wide apart and nailed to the wall.He was never found.2 months later, something similar happened.More murders.More talk about a person going mad with stress.3 months after that, another incident.And then quiet.Nobody put it together, and every body forgot about it.Until 7 months later, where multiple incidents occurred around the globe.The first week was horrific.Somebody stepped up and tried to diagnose it, and, after a further 5 weeks of horrifying murders, grim stories about bodies found in varying shapes and patterns, somebody found the cause.It was the drug they all took 50 or so years ago.Chaos occurred for another year, and then it started to get quiet.The world isn't like it was anymore.It's a mess.No luxuries, no easy life.Even the wealthy amongst us couldn't stop it.They were all in the 99% of the people who took the drug.All that was left was fear.There's still some crazies out there now.
