Dear Diary,

This morning, I reached into the kitchen cabinet to grab my husband's mug for his daily cup of coffee.When I felt for the mug and took it from the cabinet, I realized it was different.Instead of "#1 Dad" like it normally reads, it said "#14,985,664 Dad."Of course Paul wasn't up yet, so I went to Ian, sitting on the computer in his bedroom."Very funny," I told him."Did your brother put you up to this?"Ian swiveled around in his chair.His smile slipped away and his face transformed into a look of genuine concern.He kept looking at the mug and looking at my face.The look in his eyes reminded me of the time we told him that his pet rabbit had died.I was uneasy."Did..." he started, "Did you swap out Dad's mug?"At this point I was beginning to wonder if the school play was getting to him, and if Ian was becoming a better actor after all."Of course not," I told him."I had assumed it was you or Paul.""No, mom," he shakily replied, "look at this."He moved over to show me his flickering computer screen."*He's always got his face in that machine,*" I thought, "*of course he's trying to distract me with something unrelated.*"

On screen, he had one of those social media sites up.The one with the little bird.There was so much going on in the screen I couldn't concentrate.He told me, "Mom, look what's trending.Hashtag, dad-gate"

*"What on Earth?"* I thought.Or at least, I *thought* that I had thought it.I must have whispered it under my breath, because Ian began explaining that because of Nixon's fiasco at Watergate, people have begun to use the "-gate" suffix to describe a scandal.He showed me photos of mugs that had "#693,200 Dad" on it, mugs that had "1337,000,000" which was apparently significant, and all kinds of other numbers.He even said our president sent out a twitter saying "#1 Dad," but that the image probably had a photo-shop.I still don't know what any of this means.I have to take the kids to school.I'll write another entry tonight.
