There are some things that money cant buy ...like manners, or morals, or integrity ...good thing I have a fucking sweet mansion though!When I secretly became the richest man in the world, I didnt think my life would be so vanilla.I mean, I have everything I could ever want and more, but I cant let anyone know that its mine.Whats the point of getting limited edition, carbon fiber, diamond encrusted Heelys if no one is around to see me use them!?Before I became a billionaire, I was working a shitty little office job.Long, boring hours.Lazy co-workers.And one hard-ass boss.God, I hated that guy.Always yelling and screaming.Making me be his errand boy.Getting pissy whenever the coffee I made him wasnt the right temperature.
The moment I made my fortune, I promised myself Id never do that trivial nonsense ever again.But there I was, back in that same tiny cubicle.My management team told me it would be better if I took my old job back.No one would suspect that the guy who begged for his office gig back could secretly be able to buy a small country.I know what youre thinking.Youre being ridiculous.A wonderful, rich dude like you shouldnt need to hide his lifestyle. Well, Ill tell ya what.A lot of people want you dead when they realize you have money.After my first cohort of  friends pooled their money together to put a hit on me; I learned its better to keep your circle small.And by the way, I paid that hitman ten times what they were going for.Whoever said actions speak louder than words have never spoken to my man Ben Franklin.Now, lets talk business.Word around the street is you have a dog.And that you care an awful lot about it.Am I correct?With my contacts and resources, I can make your canine companion practically immortal.Im no stranger to revenge myself, but I figure it would be better to consult an expert.So, Mr. Wick, what do you think would be the best course of action to make that asshole regret the day he fired me!?
