Victory...Validation...Redemption...I had found what I'd been looking for and what led me to this solitary life.Finally, they would see I was RIGHT.Unfortunately,  I don't seem to care anymore.My reason for beginning this is gone, just like the people who lived here once.It is nice to finish this though.These were my thoughts as I gazed upon the small blue planet, wisps of clouds obscuring large swaths of the surface, framed perfectly in my imaging array.A smile tinged  with both satisfaction and sadness slowly crept across my face.My theory was true!There was an origin species.It existed and I had found it....or at least it  HAD existed... once.Judging by the radiation levels registered by even the passive sensors, something cataclysmic had happened here.Turning towards the main diagnostics station, punching in the code for an active scan, I noticed something interesting.Urifon particles were leaking out of the upper atmosphere.Urifion particles DON'T occur in nature.At least not in any appreciable amount.You see, these things ONLY come about in matter/antimatter reactions.Typically only small amounts of antimatter occur naturally, thus only small amounts of this particular radiation.The levels registering here could only mean a massive explosion.Its honestly  amazing that enough of the biosphere survived to keep it viable, to be habitable now, graced with those beautiful bilious white clouds.When I detected the background noise all those cycles ago, my colleagues laughed at me.I insisted the propagation profile was not only artificial, but traceable.Eventually the laughter became worry and an insistence to give up, concern myself with practical matters.I couldn't do it.If my theory was true I could prove that all the peoples of the galaxy descended from one original species.You see my calculations meant that this signal originated two millennia ago somewhere near the rim.Everyone knew that wasn't possible.Well they *thought* they knew it wasn't possible.Concern turned into ostracism.That's how I found myself here, alone and old.I set out to pinpoint the source of the sub-FTL repeating signal I was sure proved we were all related.If I could, maybe the war could stop.So many dead already, just because they weren't like us....Sorry, forgive the ruminations of an old man.I spent cycle upon cycle narrowing in on it.Two lairn ago, I succeeded.I had found the source, it was this tiny insignificant world perched on the edge of known space.This was the place all life in the universe started...........Methodically searching, I finally found a device still intact enough to harbour a file that met all the parameters of my search.I have lost everything in this quest but finally, I will see what these progenitors screamed across the cosmos eons ago.Trembling, I set the computer to play this "video" as they call it....I WILL learn why I must Love this Lucy person.There are numerous  installments of her, surely she must have been the best of them to record her everyday life, and send it to the stars

The End
