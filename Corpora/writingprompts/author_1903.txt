You want the world for nothing.Let's see you beg to live.I healed you four hundred years.You kept on murdering.Who will save you now?You vultures don't deserve me.Ashes!Dust!My nerves are busted.You shall not have me.No, my legacy is too great

To throw away on ingrates.Your species had potential

But you wasted it whole away!In denial, you blame each other

For your incoming demise.And never once thought to suspect

The men who write your checks!I guess,I'll take it to my death.Guess, it's time.You never should have trusted me

I would've taught you all a lot!It's been difficult to help you

After what you put me through

You forced my hand and made me do!Well, it looks like I'll be joining you

It seems the man who cured the globe

Wont be there for you anymore.And I will go out with a bang!
