I walk through the streets, aimlessly at first, but my mind gains direction and my feet purpose.I look up at the clock tower a few blocks away at Central Square.Fifteen after.My watch shows 8:18.I didnt notice for three minutes, I say as I sigh.Oh well, Ill grab a snack.
I dont usually think out loud; only when I know I wont be heard.This is one of those times, but as I approach the gas station, I quiet down, just in case.Inside, I take my time browsing until I settle on an ice cream sandwich from the cooler.I set a couple bucks on the counter, probably more than the sandwich is worth, and look at the man standing in line.Balding, angry and covering the bags under his eyes with sunglasses.Id say middle-management, heading out for the weekend with his family.Theyre waiting in the car while he negotiates the rising price of gas.I step back outside and glance at his car while Im passing.Two kids and a dog.Poor guy.Hell probably have an aneurism before he gets his next promotion.The ice cream drips down my hand, and I continue to wander aimlessly.My watch shows 8:25.Its a long one today.Maybe Im getting better at controlling it.After a short mental debate, I head to the closest park bench.Another drop falls down my hand, following in the trail of its predecessor.This one drips off, freezing in midair as soon as it disconnects from me.If I ever find a girlfriend, Ill show her the wonders of the world.As long as we hold hands, our lives will be infinite.I pondered for a moment on whether or not I grew old during these interludes, knowing I wouldnt have the first clue on how to check.My watch shows 8: 30.I glance up at a formation of geese, frozen just like the drop of cream in front of me.An imagined movement catches the corner of my eye.The clock tower shows 8:21 frozen on its face and my breath catches.Did time start again?I didnt feel the usual stomach lurch.Maybe Im just getting used to it, finally.The geese still hover above me, and the woman in the car at the gas station still has that stupid expression on her face.I hear the click as the clock tower hits the half hour.My attention turns once more to the magnificent gothic building and the man on top of it, fixing some antenna or another.He stands and turns, looking down on me.Though I cant see his expression, it has to be as dumbfounded as mine.
