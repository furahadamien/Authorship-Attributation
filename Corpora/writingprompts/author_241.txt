At first I thought I'd never see again, I was overjoyed.It happened while I was just sitting on the couch, I quickly began to run up the stairs when I finally noticed it."Don't tell them you can see don't tell them you can see don't tell them you can see don't tell them you ca-."I paused, what the hell?I slowly walked down the stairs again when my mother yelled "What is it, why were you running up here?""Nothing mom!Thought I lost something!"I quickly slapped my forehead, thought I lost something?I looked around the room, the message was everywhere, was it someone else who wrote this?I sat back down on the couch to think about this and wonder what I'll do next, I know I have to do something.I stood up and walked for the front door, ever since the blindind only one man has worked well, Josh Skylart.He's a famous scientist in the world who came up with most of the technology used now, self driving cars, automated planes, trains, this man is ahead of his time.The only way he knows any of this was from an accident that happened years before the blinding, he was kicked in the back of the head by a horse and lost his sight.After this he began to work on the technology, somehow.Maybe he guessed it all, maybe they were already planned, no one knows.I walked to the sidewalk and continued down to the corner, crossed the street and began my trek to the other side of the town.Slowly but surely I made my way there, all the while seeing "Don't tell them you can see."Everywhere, I finally made it to the taxi stop and waited for a car to pick me up.When it arrived I got in and heard a soothing female voice say "Please, say where you wish to go, or type it on the pad in front of you."I reached for the pad and stopped just before I touched it, there is no way a blind person could type on this, the taxi then began to say "If you do not select or say your location, I must ask you to leave, if you do not I will drop you off at the police station and you will have to pay a fi-"
"Skylart corperation headquarters" I said
The taxi beeped a high pitch beep and closed ita door and began its drive to skylart headquarters.I began to wonder, why would they implement this system that requires sight?Is there a point?I began to wonder, this thought continued for a while until I got to the building, the car beeped, opened its doors, and I stepped out to the massivwly tall Skylart corperation building.(Done with this for now, feel free to add on.)
