GOD FUCKING DAMN IT screamed Wrath as his slammed his clenched fists onto the meeting room table, sending a minor shockwave to rattle across it and shake the numerous cups of coffee and paperwork scattered across it THIS IS COMPLETE FUCKING BULLSHIT.ABSOLUTE GOD DAMN SHITTING BULLFUCK.Wraths Eyes were lit up like lanterns, and the hairs on the back of his neck stood up, pricking all over his blood red skin.Relax sugarbuns Came a sultry voice from across the table, one that seemed to weave and ripple through everyones ears, sending a shudder through their spines.Lust smirked at the intoxicating effect she had over the other sins and slinked upwards to her feet.You really shouldnt get yourself so worked up, darling.Her words trailed off her tongue like a lollipop I think its cute that Pride here finally got to show off his... talents.Its just not fair! Envy chirped up from his chair.He was a small figure, barely 4 feet tall, always having to shout to be heard of everyone else.His face was damp with tears and his cheeks beat red.How come Pride gets to have an entire month dedicated to him, and I get shafted.I-it isnt fair!.With that, the tears came, streaming down his freckled cheeks.His cries of jealously quickly morphed into indistinguishable hicks and sobs before he broke into full bawling.I think its bullshit! Gluttony spat out in between mouthfuls Of roast beef Little bastard like him- he stopped to take another massive bite out of the entire roast sitting in front of him, smothered in gravy and numerous spices -getting his own damn month... fuckin pig.I oughta... god this is good....I oughta teach him a lesson.Finally finishing his mini rant, Gluttony let out a hearty burp and a chuckle before returning to his one man feast 

Pride sighed to himself before running a comb through his perfect hair.He smirked and flashed his pearly white teeth to everyone present.The other sins glared at him.He was the smuggest prick in the entire underworld, worse than that jackass Pan and his stupid pipes.You lot need to chill Pride sneered, his words seeping out from his mouth like waste leaking from a sewer pipe.As much as I deserve a parade dedicated to my ~perfection~, Im afraid this one isnt my game.Im disappointed to be honest, I really wish the people of the in between would take the time to celebrate my beauty.A shit eating grin stretched across his face and he chuckled to himself.Up yours, You cocksure little freak Greed snapped out while opening his trench coat and shoving the most expensive looking crockery on the table into it.We cant all be perfect like you 

I know Pride snorted before taking a sip of his wine Otherwise thered be no point in living 

The others glared him down.There was a small
Moment of dead silence before Wrath suddenly exploded into action 

WE HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING he practically yelled, shaking the table slightly WE CANT BE SECOND FIDDLE TO THIS LITTLE UPSTART.WELL FIND A WAY TO GET OUR OWN PARADES.ENTIRE MONTHS DEDICATED TO OUR GLORY 

Envy chirped up from behind a waterfall of tears 
T-thats a good idea he blubbered B-but What If no one w-wants to c-c-elebrate.He barely finished speaking before erupting into tears again.Shut it twerp chortled Gluttony in between mouthfuls of schnitzel and bratwurst Youre- *BURP* getting on my nerves

RIGHT screamed Wrath ANY IDEAS ON HOW WELL PULL THIS ONE OFF?SLOTH, YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD? 

There was a moment of silence as everyone turned to the slightly tubby green skilled fellow, who had his head resting on the table.He didnt speak at first and everyone glanced at each other, thinking maybe hed actually died and no one had realised, before he finally spoke.His words came out a snails pace and he held the gap between each one for far longer than needed.We........ we should....... we.....I... cant remember he slurred out before snoring replaced his speech and he fell back to sleep 

Well that was a complete waste of time said Lust.She pondered to herself briefly before snapping her fingers in a eureka moment 

We could get the boss to cast one of those old hypno spells over everyone and force them too.Worked really well in that Jonestown place she hissed out 

Not bad, sunshine Pride smirked but wouldnt that be cheating 

FUCK YOU PRIDE Wrath yelled, raising his fist and bringing it down upon the table, smashing it to thousands of pieces and throwing Sloth up into the air and crashing back to the floor, where he continued to sleep JUST BECAUSE YOU GOT A DEDICATION MONTH YOU THINK YOURE HOT SHIT 

Darling, I always think that he snorted, sticking a tooth pick into his fangs and picking out a finger nail.Wrath has a point Greed snarled, picking up a golden fork from the floor and shoving into his pocket I propose youre excluded from the rest of the meeting.All in favour? 

There was a collective aye from the group of sins (minus Pride).The room fell silent and Pride shrugged his shoulders.Whatever he chuckled Ive got business to attend to anyhow.A whole night of staring in the mirror.Ciao

With that, Pride slinked out of the room and disappeared from sight.The room was quiet once more and everyone glanced at each other, waiting for the next word in.Finally, Gluttony spoke 

Its going to be a long one isnt it?Coffee anyone? 

The other sins nodded in unison and the bulbously overweight man shifted from
His chair and waddled over to the coffee pot, ready for the long night of discussion ahead.
