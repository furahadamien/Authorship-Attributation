And Chad and Brad protested that it was not gay.for they had been very drunk and they had they misunderstood what the Law meant by "getting stoned."But the Pharasees hearts were hard, for Chad and Brad had been quite hard, and, lo, it had looked pretty gay.Early in the morning Jesus came again to the temple.All the people came (teeheehee) to him and he sat down and began to teach them.The scribes and the Pharisees brought Brad and Chad who had been caught in adultery; and making them stand before all of them, they said to Jesus, Teacher, these men were caught in the very act of committing sodomy.5 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such men.Now what do you say? When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone. And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground.Jesus said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone.When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with Brad and Chad standing before him.Jesus straightened up and said to him, "Men, where are they?Has no one condemned you? Chad said, No one. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn you.Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.And Brad said, "that is easy for you to say, for you have bitches coming up shaking their hair upon your feet. "Chad said, "Sometimes a bro must help another bro out."And Jesus placed his palm upon his face.
