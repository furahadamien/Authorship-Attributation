Part 1

Padre, who is this man? Isabella Maria De Los Santos asked cautiously.She stood in the doorway, the screen door her only protection.My child, there is no need to be alarmed, started Father Paul Rodrigo.This man is here to help save your daughter.

Isabella did not move nor did she say anything.She stood still and studied the strange man.She could tell he was American just by the arrogance he had draped across his face.He donned a confident smile, which bewildered Isabella.She had seen men who had come back from war missing arms and legs; none of them smiled the way this man did.He wore military pants and a dirty wife-beater.Despite missing both his arms, he was built like an ox.Realizing she was staring, she quickly opened the door and ushered the two men in.She sat the two men on her living room couch, disappeared into her kitchen, and reappeared with a pitcher of lemonade in her hand.She poured two glasses and silently indicated to the two men to drink, not realizing only one of them was actually able to do so.She immediately turned bright red and disappeared back into the kitchen, leaving the two men waiting for several minutes.After the heat dissipated from her cheeks, she returned, this time with a straw in hand.Thank you, the mysterious man said.He had a deep and easily recognizable voice.The way he looked at her made her feel like he was piercing his soul.She could feel her face flush again and she looked away in embarrassment.Isabella, this is Captain Larry James Sanderson.Hes come all the way from the States to save your daughter.

Please to meet you, maam, he said without skipping a beat.And which church do you serve, Senior Sanderson? she asked meekly.Its just Larry maam, and I dont come from any church, he answered.A confused looked spread across Isabellas face and she searched for answers from the Father."How can a man with no faith possibly hope to defeat the Devil? she asked concerned.Well thats easy, Larry said reassuringly.All I have to do is punch the bastard until he cant take it any more and itll leave your poor little girl alone. She felt his enigmatic smile radiating warmth and despite his puzzling words, she put her faith and trust into the man."That and I don't believe this is the work of the Devil"

This way, she said standing up.The two men followed closely behind her.
