I woke up too find myself facing a cute little girl playing with a tea set.I looked around confused,I had just been crossing an intersection and then...then it got hazy.I tried too recall and suddenly remembered a speeding car passing a red light.I remembered the pain as a pool of blood gathered on the asphalt.So what am I doing here?I looked at my surrounding and found myself in a pastel pink room.I was sitting at a table facing a girl playing with a tea set.I was dressed in a complete suit with a top hat,cane,the full 9 yards.Mr Charles would you like some tea?

I jumped as I realized the girl was talking too me while flashing a big toothy smile.I stumbled too utter a response,

Ah yes of course and who might you be?

The little girl giggled,

Im Samantha, Nice too meet you Mr.Fred told me that someone else would be joining me for tea today!

Oh in that case Ill have some tea

I smiled while I pieced together my situation and could only think that I must be an imaginary friend of some sort.To think that everybody had it wrong,that religion wasnt real but the imaginary friends some had as kids were.I laughed at the irony before I continued too play my part.Soon,Tea time ended and Samantha told me with a smile that she had too go too sleep so she could grow big and strong.I smiled and said goodbye.Then I realized that I had no idea what too do but I remembered her mentioning a Fred so I figured I would stay till he showed up.And so I sat through the night pondering all sorts of things while getting used too my situation.I sat in my tea chair before being awoken from my stupor by a creeping sound,Samanthas closet began too slowly creep open.I looked over and saw a bloodshot eye staring at Samantha.The hair stood up on my neck as a 10 foot tall monster of darkness with two bloodshot beady eyes creeped out of the closet.It had an unnaturally long neck that bent at weird painful looking angles as it moved at surprisingly fast speed towards the sleeping Samantha.I left too my feet and grabbed the only object I could find,my cane and jumped at the thing.I was rushed and couldnt process the situation well but figured I was already dead so I might risk my self for this cute little girl.I intercepted the monster with my cane and smacked it  on its terrifying neck.The tip of my cane fell of in the impact revealing a shining blade.The monster stopped too look at me before smiling,showing off horrifying needle like teeth.It leapt at me and all I could see were its bloodshot eyes as he pounced on me.-Thanks for reading just thought this would be fun :)
