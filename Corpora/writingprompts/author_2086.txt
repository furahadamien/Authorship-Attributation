She is staring at me.Say something."I'm not staring, you are staring."Oh, right.She can hear that.*Why did I say that out loud?I could have just thought it.*

Sorry.I'm not used to this.Like, actually talking to your voice instead of trying to silence it.*You think I am?*

Yeah, well I know what you did too.*What I mean is that we are a little past the point of being embarrassed, don't you think?*

Good point.*So what now?*

You know, I'm glad to discover I'm not crazy.So wanna grab a coffee with me?*Well, that's an unusual pick-up line, but sure, I'd love to.*
