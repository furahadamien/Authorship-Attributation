When I was younger, my mother told me that no matter what happens I needed to be strong.She told me that the world was a cruel place and my sister Kay needed protecting.It didnt make sense to me at the time, this world was full of wonder and adventure.My thirst for adventure led me to the Army when I was eighteen.One day my commander called me into his office.There was an accident back at home.My mother and sister were involved in a car accident, killing my mother and gravely wounding Kay.I was given some leave time to return home and grieve.The next few months were rough, rougher than anything the Army had put me through.My days were spent tending to my sister for the accident had left her blind.Little did I know that the real trials were yet to come.A few years later my time in the armed forces were up.After leaving the Army, I was able to get an apartment for my sister and I.Despite losing her eyesight, Kay was able to live happily.For a while, I believe I was happy too.Then, one day I woke up in my dark room.I could hear the television in the other room.The news was on as I was slowly making my way out of bed.This is an emergency, please stay in your homes until we have further information

This snapped me out of my auto-pilot.What had happened?I walked over to the other side of the room in the darkness.Feeling my way around I get to the light switch and turn on the lights.Nothing happens.Trying the light switch a few more times I start to feel like something is very wrong.I feel my way into the living room where the television is.Thats when it hit me, I was blind.For two years there was nothing, just nothing at all.Everyones eyesight was gone.They ended up calling it the Great Blinding.Funny, how they give the worst things titles such as *great*.After the first few months everything started to seem like it was going to work out.Without eyesight, everyone started being a lot nicer to each other.There was no longer any prejudice based on skin or race because no one could tell the difference.After two years of living in peace, everything changed once again.There was a terrible screech that woke me out of my sleep.I jolted up in my bed.Then again, I heard a scream.It was coming from my sisters room!Hastily, I made my way into my sister's room.There was someone in there with her I could hear her struggling.Jumping into the frey, I fumble myself on the back of this intruder.I was able to subdue the intruder and put him in a choke hold.My military combat training was paying off.Run away!Ill hold him off Kay! I yelled into the darkness.There were footsteps moving heading out of the room.My sister would be safe.I could feel my choke hold working, this guys strength was fading.Just as I was sure this guy wouldnt be getting back up anytime soon, a thud.Something hit me, and it hit me hard.Was my sister safe at least?Some time later I woke up in my sisters room.I could feel the sun on my face coming through the window.How long was I knocked out?I struggle getting up; my head hurts like hell.Wait a second, I start feeling around looking for my sister.Shes not here!Making my way to the window something feels different.The sun, Im not just feeling it on my face, I can see it!Im not really sure what is going on.Slowly, I opened my eyes.My vision was back!What happened?Is this really happening?How am I able to see again?I turned around to once again go over the scene.Kays bed was bloody and the room a total mess.Thats when I noticed it.On the walls, on the ceiling, on the mirror.*DONT TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE.* In the mirror, my reflection looks back at me.What I saw was terrifying.My eyes, they werent normal anymore.They were all black, no irises or anything else just black pupil.What happened to me?
