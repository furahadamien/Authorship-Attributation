My life was over.My wife left me.My boss fired me (and then hired my ex as his 'personal' assistant.)My kids only cared for what I'd get them for Christmas.I had nothing left.This world sucked.Who would ever want to live in it?I remembered a time long ago when I was happy.The game world.I'd be travelling the world.I'd be killing wolves in the forest.I'd be making potions in the apothecary.I'd be competing in combat.So I removed the Veearr goggles, and looked up at my father."You were right father, a peaceful world is just a dream that no one realises the consequences of.I'm sorry I doubted you."My father smiled at me."Son, how about we go do some hunting?You're old enough to learn Ice Storm.It roots AND does damage to the mobs!"I jumped up excited again.Who would ever want to live in a fantasy world without monsters?&#x200B;
