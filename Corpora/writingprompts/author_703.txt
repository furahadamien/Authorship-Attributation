Thank you for joining us this evening.Here are our top stories:

Is the ambition of scientists to be the first to solve the 'Earth's cooling core' crisis interfering with real progress towards a solution?Religious fanaticism grows with a new video released by the controversial cult group 'Theologicians' asserting that "Heaven is, in fact, a very real place much like our own Earth" that can be reached through "sufficiently righteous means."In Boston, protest turns violence as fervor over euthanasia rights continues to build.And our top story tonight...Twisted tragedy strikes in Texas this afternoon.We hear from surviving members of the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders as they describe the horror of watching 14 of their sisters brutally murdered by what is described as "a naked psycho" wielding a "bizarre knife" who then went on to attempt to "slit his own throat."Ironically the man's life was saved by a surviving member of the DCC with former medical training.Police confirm that the assailant is "under heavy guard" while being treated for his injuries and will be subsequently taken into custody to await trial.
