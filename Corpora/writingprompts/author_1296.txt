Click.The light over him clicked off.Hed been sitting still too long, and the motion detector turned off his light.Again.Alexander Thomas stood and took off his heavy glasses, and massaged the bridge of his nose and looked into the fuzzy distance.The light over him snapped back on.He put his glasses back on, and the fuzzy distance instantly snapped into focus.He looked down the long aisle of books, six rows high, and almost a quarter mile long.As he stood at one end and stared down the row at the converging bookcases as they ran into the unlit darkness at the other end of the row, he thought for the umpteenth time, My life.

For what felt like, and very really could be, the millionth time, he thanked whomever had created the abridged editions and indices of his life.His unabridged life was 70,674 numbered volumes, each of approximately 1800 pages, patiently cross-referenced for each interaction he had with someone, anyone, so long as the interaction merited inclusion in their life volume.Even the abridged version of his life was 21 numbered volumes.Not for the first time, he chuckled to himself, the abridged version of his life warranted an abridged version and index all its own.In looking around this library, it seemed that if a persons life was more than 20 numbered volumes, they also had an abridged version of their life and an index.It wasnt that hard to reach those kinds of numbers, when you lived the kind of life he lived.His first inaugural address alone was 14 volumes, and his second inaugural address was another 17 volumes.Everyone who watched or listened to either and/or both of the speeches and had an impression that warranted inclusion in their live volumes was referenced.Just over 10 million entries on slightly over two and a half hours of his life.His first campaign was another 25 volumes of almost nothing but cross-references.As he looked down the rows of his life, and into the darkness of the unlit areas of the space, the impact of his life on so many weighed on him again.His life wasnt even the largest in the room.That would be Pope Giovanni III, who he had met shortly before he died.Giovanni, or George as he asked to be called in private, had nearly 2 miles of volumes - half an aisle.Even Alexanders predecessor had more volumes that he did, but he had been in public life, first as a governor, then as a senator, then as a president, and finally, as a respected statesman, for nearly 70 years.Alexanders public life had been cut short before his 65th birthday.He had long since made peace with the fact that he impacted so many peoples lives.He knew it when he was alive, and now that it was down in front of him in black and white, it was really stunning.When he first found himself in this room, he searched in vain for a way out.He had no way of accurately measuring it, but it seemed like his life room was roughly 16 square miles - roughly four miles on a side.By his rough calculations, there were more than 260 million volumes of peoples lives in this room.In the eternity that he had been locked in, he had walked every aisle at least twice.Row after row after row of volumes of peoples lives.Each volume had the same reddish leather cover and differed in only the names and volume numbers, and, in a very few instances, their thickness.From what he could tell, no volume was over approximately 1800 pages, but there were tragically too many volumes that were much shorter.The shortest volume that he had found was Ginas daughter, Erica, who had died just three days after she was born.Even that volume was almost 100 pages long.Just a sliver of his life, but amazing in how much she had impacted others by her short existence.For the millionth, or billionth time he walked to the door again and tried the knob.It still didnt move.Somewhere in those over 260 volumes of peoples lives was the key to escaping this room.Because to escape this room, he had to figure out what he missed.Because that is what the sign on the door said: Only those who know what they have missed may enter the afterlife through this door.

That door was the only way out.Click.Darkness again.He was still too long again.For the millionth, or billionth time, he stood up, and took off his glasses and moved about waiting for the motion sensor to see his movement and turn the light back on.After all, in an eternity, who cares how many times it happens?After a few seconds, the light clicked back on.He went to the next volume of his life and tried to figure out what he had missed.Suddenly a name popped out at him.Lt. Susanna Moore-Bergquist.His memory of that name was just beyond his grasp, but he knew he recognized it, and it was important.For the first time in a long time, Alexander moved quickly to find someones life stories.When he got to the Ms, he moved quickly down the aisle about 3/4 of the way down, and found her name.Volume 9.Pages 1467 through 1680.Over two hundred pages?That cant be right.His entire military career, from bootcamp through his medical retirement after recieving the Medal of Honor was 300 abridged pages.Granted, the unabridged version was 3 volumes, but most of that was the references to the people he commanded, or killed.Gina, his first love, was only 180 abridged pages.Lt. Moore-Bergquists life story was 18 volumes.Not uncommon for someone in either medicine or the military, where you wound up having a big impact on other peoples lives and coming into contact with a lot of different people.But still, over 200 unabridged pages?He stood there, bracing the book on the shelf, poring over her story, and why he was so important to her.Click.Darkness again.He took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose again, but the light didnt come on.Oh, yeah, right.He had to move and he had just been standing there.Alexander stepped back and the book fell.Not wanting to lose his place, he grabbed for it in the dark.And he dropped his glasses.His only pair of glasses.Then he heard that sound that everyone who has ever heard it will recognize.The sound of breaking glass.Click.Light.Fuzzy sparkles on the ground.Alexander couldnt see what was causing them, but he knew what they were.The broken lenses of his glasses.His future.His answers.His hope.All gone.Alexander stood in stunned silence, too much in shock to even react.Then he heard a sound he had never heard in this afterlife.The sound of a key in a lock.And he knew in an instant that the door was open.Using his hands, he fumbled his way to the door and tried the knob for the millionth or billionth time.For the first time it turned and the door swung open.Alexander rushed through the door, and under the archway that said: Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.
