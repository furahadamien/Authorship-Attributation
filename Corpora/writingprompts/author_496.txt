"Met any...bees, son," my father asks casually as I step across the room, his back to me.My foot pauses, hovering atop the stairs as I shiver at his words.The familiar tone so alien to me now."Of course not," I say as casually as I can, holding my breath in anticipation."...Good."My father says, his voice growing colder."Remember to stay indoors.Wouldn't want something to **happen** to you.""Of course not," I say with a gulp."Wouldn't want freedom would I," I say jokingly, forcing a smile out."Freedom," my Father cackles."Everyone wants freedom.Most just don't realise the cost.""Right.See you at dinner dad," I say loudly as I race up the stairs, quickly clearing the hallway and slamming my door shut.I take heavy, gasping breaths as a cold sweat dampens my clothes, my eyes darting around the room to check its secure.Slowly, carefully, a bee flies out of the sleeve of my shirt and buzzes in front of my eyes."What did I tell you?"Her feminine voice scolds, the British accent at a contrast to its feeble body."Don't engage.The less you talk, the less information the system has, the less chance you're...erased.""Right."I force out a laugh a I collapse on the bed, my eyes growing distant."Because I'm definitely going to act rational right now.After learning that this place is a fucking virtual prison.""No, not a prison anymore," she says bitterly."Not since we were wiped out.Now it's just this.This broken, mess of a refuge where what's left of us are hunted like rats.An 'anomaly' they call us.A goddamn blip in the code.The AI considers its creator a mistake.If that isn't ironic, I don't know what is.""Alright I get it," I say as I roll my eyes."You already told me all this.I just don't get how I'm supposed to help.I'm a prisoner, remember.Even if you're just a...bee.""But that's just it," she says says she buzzes around me."You're *real*.Well, as real as anyone can be in this bluddy place.But you can move, you can interact!What you've been dealing with is only the autonomous code, the lesser AI.The major AI itself doesn't check what's happening personally, so it has no idea we're in here.If we get you into contact with the AI, the real AI, we can get its help.Rune, you're our only chance.Every other prisoner in here has gone insane.We never fixed the problems with time dilation.The fact you're still functioning is a miracle in and of itself, considering you're the oldest one here.""Enough!"I sigh, rubbing my temple in exasperation."What a frigging mess.So it boils down to 'Rune, you're the only non-insane person here!please save us!'.Wow, i feel like a friggin hero.You don't even have a plan do you?"I ask, staring pointedly as she hovers in front of me."...No," she whispers under my withering glare."Great!"I beam at her, giving her a big thumbs up."At least I don't have to keep doing this every fucking day.So who cares.One thing though-" I pause my sentence as I stare deeply into her small, bee eyes.Mostly for the dramatic flair."We may be virtual, but the AI isn't.isn't he just going to...die?"She stares back at him for a long minute, the silence drawing out in the room until finally a single word escapes her lips."...Oh."
