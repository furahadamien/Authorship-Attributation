Joseph was tired.He'd been collecting water for the best part of a day - avoiding the most irradiated parts of the city.He'd learned where the good spots were early on, and it was keeping him alive.A crow squawked loudly.Roughly.It had ventured into the dead zone recently, he figured.He stopped himself going for his beaten rifle - this crow wasn't worth the ammunition.Besides, he'd need to visit Jerry soon to replenish his dwindling supply.He put his hand in his pocket and fingered the last 7 cartridges.And then he saw it.A car.It looked like a car anyway.It made a strange high pitched noise.*What on Earth was it?*

A man stepped out of the car.He must have been Latino - not uncommon for Texas by a long shot, but he was impeccably dressed in pre-war clothes.Joseph quickly pulled the cartridges out and loaded 3 into his rifle.Shaking like a leaf, he called out his command: "Who are you?!""Beruhige dich, ich bin nicht hier, um dich zu verletzen."The stranger had responded.Joseph had no idea what he was saying, he was only 30 and had only ever known how to speak American.There were no other languages spoken, although he'd heard people used to speak a multitude of languages, but since the closing of the borders, everyone had only spoke American.The well-dressed man walked forward and Joseph called out again - this time louder.The man chuckled to himself and then spoke with a crisp British accent "I am sorry my friend, I didn't mean to alarm you.I'm from the Ministry of Advancement - We're here to celebrate the opening of the borders!"He gave Joseph a cheery smile.The cheery smile faded as Joseph's companions walked out from the ruined buildings, looking equally as ragged and began advancing on the vehicle with their weapons raised."Please gentlemen, we mean you no harm!The world has advanced significantly - we're all learning to live together again" the man lied.Joseph walked forward and chambered a round into his rifle.He raised it, and shot the man.The driver exited the vehicle, waving his arms frantically.Without any warning whatsoever, the barren landscape erupted in a hail of gunfire.The man, riddled with bullets, slumped against the car as shards of glass flew through the air.The gunfire stopped and a deafening silence washed over the landscape, punctuated only by the sound of steam coming from the pockmarked car.*"You'd better close the borders again Larry, it looks like it's happening all over again"*
