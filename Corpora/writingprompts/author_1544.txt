When Bob finished his morning wake up routine, and walked into small apartment's joint kitchen/dinning/living room, he was surprised to see a see a small envelope on the table.It had not been there the night before when he had last been in the the room.Shaking his head he ignored the envelope initially as he proceeded to get his customary glass of juice to take with his morning pills.The voices were really active this morning.He palmed his pills, painkillers and anti-psychotics from the small pillbox on his counter and downed them suppressing a laugh about the futility of taking the meds prescribed to suppress the voices."Schitzophrenic my ass" he muttered under his breath 

He sat down with the cold Pastramy and provalone sandwhich he tad taking from the fridge with his juice and started to eat while he waited for the carnival ride that was his daily life to start.By the time he had finished his sandwhich an ethereal man in a Well tailored suit was sitting across the table behind the envelope.There was a handsome quality to his face, despite the scar on his left cheek, beginning just above his lip and running across to the corner of his jaw.If it were not for his cruel looking eyes, he might even have been called that."I thought i told you to get out.""You told me to get out or start paying Rent.You will find my half of the rent to be met. "As the man Pushed the envelope across the table he smilled a lopsided smile.Bob proceeded to start rubbing his forehead with his index and middle finger while resting his Thumb on his cheekbone."You're a real piece of work George.a real piece of work."he paused half a momment."How likely is it rent is going to cause me legal troubles?""Really Robert, so little respect?""George, You have yet to do a damn thing that hasn't led to someone running to authority, or wishing they could.""Say what you will Robert, my methods get results."Bob frowned as he crossed his arms on the table without quite touching the envelope."Your methods got you stuck with me when your enemies caught up to you and put an end to your career.""It no fault of mine Robert you are the only person in this wretched city who can see or hear me.""Lucky me."Edit: formatting
