My eyes opened.The gentle breeze flowing through my window of the Spring season in California was reminding me of when I was a child, playing in the grass and bush of the local wildlife preserve.I want to relive those moments and experience those feelings of wonder and amazement at any moment.When you're a child, nothing stops you from finding seeing life in its fullest potential."Remember when grandpa died?"Anna asked."You didn't leave your room for a whole week.I don't even remember if you ate during that time.""I did, but not very much.He was the one that took us to the hills to play.He taught me most of what I know.I still miss him."I chimed.Pausing for a brief moment, then Anna adds, "And you love to eat too.I remember us going to the buffet and seeing you try to eat a mountain of fried rice, jello and spare ribs.""I think the last time I tried that I got the worst stomach flu following.""You were miserable."She laughs.Laughing back, "Well so was mom when see had to clean all the puke from my bed and the bathroom.I think I got some on Butter too.""That straggly dog.I forgot about him..." Anna looks down with a sad look, "I miss mom..."

"Me too..."

Years have gone since our mother passed away from breast cancer.She fought hard and stayed strong for the longest time.The amount of pain she was in never left her face, even despite her efforts of not wanting to impose it on her four children.The last image we would see of her is that of a teary eyes and the most gentle smile I would never see again.Watery eyed, Anna musters the words, "Dad did such a great job though.""He did.Three kids and he had to deal with all of our shit.Like when you and Sebastian had a 3 month long war over you gets to hold the TV controller."Dad passed of lung cancer five years ago.Smoking was his method of stress relief, and he was always stressed.His hard work and fighting spirit lives on, imprinted forever in our character."And I won..." But the urge of crying could not stop in her as it let itself out with force."What's wrong?"I ask."Everything has just been so hard.For so long we barely ate, dad was hardly home because of his three jobs and it was a struggle just to find the will to get out bed.""But we did, and we became strong because of it.We never got along until I gave you my ice cream that one time."Sobbing, Anna asks, "You remember that?""Of course.I was 12 and you were 9.Sebastian took yours.I thought that was a terrible act of him so I gave you mine."With the gentle smile I never thought I'd see again, Anna looks at me and says, "And I haven't loved you less since."I looked into her eyes, tears beginning to well up in mine."Where is Sebastian anyways?"Anna's smiling face turns into disappointment as she answers, "Last I saw of him, he was looking for money from anywhere he could look in my apartment.""I hope he's okay..."

Sebastian is our oldest brother.He took it the hardest as everything seemed to be crashing down.We saw that he tried to stay strong.He tried his hardest, but he found comfort where it shouldn't be found.The money he was looking for was in desperation to buy his nest high.The lack of it was the only thing keeping him away from the needle.On the verge of crying again, Anna sobs, "Why were we put on this earth?If there Go-"

Interrupting, "Anna, now is not the time for that."Anna and I fought through depression together as late teenagers.She's always been more negative though.Her attempts on her own life left scars on the both of us.Physical ones on her.It was when we found our strength in each other that we were able to pull out of it.Continuing, "We're alive, we've lived.The most beautiful moments were birthed from us being there for each other.From us finding our strength.From us finding who we are."I'm fighting back tears, but moving forward through them, "I have seen you grow into the most beautiful women I will ever know.You're married to an amazing husband, with three children who will live a life better than ours because you decided to be strong!You've become a social worker because you hate to see children suffer the same way we did.You are making life what it should be for others!"Full on crying and with all her emotion pouring out, she asks, "Then what should life be?!You're only 35!You've barely had any chance to live a happy life, for most of it we've been miserable!"In my head I chuckled.*Only 35*?Perspective is one hell of a thing.I'm going to miss trying to understand what other people are thinking.Hell, I'll miss everything.My relationships, my hard, yet uplifting job as an 8th grade teacher, my home, the life I built up...But my years flew ahead of me and my body became weak.The cancer that grew from my bones had no problem taking over, and now...I'm in my final moments.For the past 2 years I have felt nothing but pain until they the doctor finally said, "It's terminal."Then I felt light.Since those words were uttered I felt the weight of the world lift.Now it was the rest of my life.When I close my eyes, I hear a soft, feminine, strong voice tell me *everything is okay* and a warm sensation spread around my head as though someone is gently caressing it.I'm... happy.With some emotion on my face, I answer, "I'm not sure.If there is a God, maybe he will tell us after we lived it."With another burst of emotion, Anna responds, "I love you so much!You are my strength... Where will I be without you...?""You are strong on your own now.You have built the foundation for your own strength.You are your own fortress.And I'll always be with you.Just not physically."Still crying, Anna clenches my hands harder.It hurts...But that's okay.I look at her to study the person she's become.At 32, Anna, my beautiful sister, resembles so much of mom.I just now noticed.With a childish grin I ask, "Let me get you ice cream."Through her tears she laughs.I succeeded.I got to see that smile once more.The smile my mother last gave to me.We spend the rest of our afternoon eating ice cream and laughing about the good times.Anna gazes into my eyes for a moment before telling me she loves me.After a gentle kiss to the forehead she says, "I'll see you tomorrow, brother.""You too."I mutter, before closing my eyes.*with a sudd* "Whoa..."

"How was it?"Mixtha asks."Uh, great..."

A smokey haze filled the room above me.My friends convinced me to try this drug for the first time.Take one big hit from the bong and you live a life in four hours.I was hesitant to, but did because why not?I then add, "When is it good for me to take another rip?"First time posting.Let know what you think!
