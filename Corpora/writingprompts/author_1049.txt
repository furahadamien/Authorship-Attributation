"Honey."It's my wife speaking.Her hand is on my arm.Her fingers dig into my coat like they do to the skin on my back when we're making love.She wants me *with* her, *in* her - to stay.But the feeling is different.For some reason.It's...it's all wrong.I want to leave.Why won't she let me?Usually I don't mind; but for some reason, that red line is glowing like a neon light of temptation - a gambling sign in Vegas, a honky-tonk bar-slash-strip club, probably.Her robe falls partly open, and I see the rounded curve of a smooth breast.She did it on purpose.I'm not aroused.I'm angered.*Everytime she doesn't get what she wants, she does this!Why can't she just let me be a man!Let me go in peace!*

I feel trapped.I want freedom.Independence.Air.Her hand is everywhere where it shouldn't be.She's whispering into my ear, warning me about all the things she's going to do to me if I follow her into the bedroom.I'm astounded by her nerve.I'm disgusted and ashamed at myself, for I know there was a point in time when I would've been turned on by her seductive threats."Leave me alone, damnit!"I push her away.She falls backward onto the couch.She's scared - her eyes wide and innocent.Her robe is open completely now but she's too scared to move.She doesn't know who I am.She's waiting for me to say something, to remind her that the man standing in front of her isn't a stranger.But I can't...I don't even know who I am anymore...The red line has changed me.I open the door and leave.She calls my name and that's the last thing I hear before I slam the door.Edit: Might continue.
