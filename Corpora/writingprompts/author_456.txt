In 2017, my great great great great grandfather, Jameson Pearlson purchased a star, VY Canis Majoris, he was 12 at the time of purchase and was, in his time, considered to be a massive nerd who was obsessed with space.Thirty years later, when he was 42, he was designated as the leader of an exploratory/colony mission to the very star system that he had purchased, a decision that he had persisted on again and again until his superiors finally caved in.On May 14th, 2047, he left Earth, leaving his wife of twenty years and his 15 year old son behind.He maintained contact with mission command until he and his team initiated warp drive, from that point on communication ceased, and Pearlson was never heard from again.Fast-forward 300 years and you have me, Jeremy Peets, a middle-class nobody working 40 hours a week for a robotics repair center in lower Miami, Florida.I had no family, only a handful of friends, most of which were slowly becoming to entrenched in their love-life to have time for me, and nobody looking forward to seeing me when I got home.Home was a mere 500 square foot box with a couple paper-thin walls making three small rooms for a bed and a bathroom, and the main room being the living room.Even working 40 hours a week I barely had enough money to pay for my living arrangements and food.I was tired of the monotony of it all and everyday I became just a little more depressed.One day, as I approached the door to my small apartment on the 20th floor of a 200 story mega apartment building, I noticed that my door wasn't closed entirely.It was pushed up against the threshold, but wasn't quite latched.My first instinct was to back away and call building security, but the part of me that had just gotten off a double shift decided I didn't care that much and pushed the door open anyway.Inside, sitting on my sofa and flipping through the stations on my small plasma television set, were two people dressed in turquoise colored robes with a trio of golden horns set upon their head.Upon my entrance, they stood, turned off the television set, and bowed before me."Uhm.." was all I could mutter, the strangeness of the situation was overwhelming.The one on the left, the larger of the two, well built and with a head of curly brown hair, spoke first."Lord Peets, we beg pardon for our intrusion, but we come bearing news from the Pearlson Empire in the Canis Majoris Nebula."His voice was deep and demanded attention.I closed my eyes, put my hands up to my temples and rubbed."What.. How.. No..I don't want what you're selling, just leave."I stammered, wanting nothing to do with this ridiculousness.The one on the right spoke now, she was smaller, and her eyes were a burning purple color, the likes of which I had not seen outside of raves."Lord Peets, I don't think you understand.We are not here to sell you anything.We are here to give you the keys to a kingdom you could not even begin to imagine yet.""Let me guess," I interrupted, "All you need is my bank account information?""No," spoke the male, "We simply need you to listen."The female continued where the male stopped, "Three centuries ago, one of your ancestors left this world and flew to the stars where he created his own galactic empire that has grown, undisturbed by most outside forces.He passed his throne down through his blood-line, but alas his great great great grandson was impotent and birthed no heirs.You, Jeremy Peets, are the closest living heir to the Pearlson Empire, and we aare here to bring you to your rightful place, at the head of our empire.You will become a king among kings, experience riches beyond your wildest dreams, and have nearly unlimited power at your fingertips.You just need to come with us."I stood in the doorway of my small apartment, baffled by what I had just heard.I looked around, partly looking for a hidden camera, partly imagining my life drenched in gold and diamonds.I met the gaze of the two intruders, and against my normal, and often better, judgement I replied, "Take me."Edit: Paragraph breaks
