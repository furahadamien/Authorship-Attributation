"What do you have to say for yourself Mr.Lundgow?"I didn't have much to say.They would never understand that I was humanities greatest savior.I had saved hundreds of lives in an undoomed world.I had to try to explain it again."The dagger is magical and saves people in another reality where the world doesn't end in four years."I was calm.My reasoning was good."Why do you think the world is going to end Mr.Lundgow?""The angel who gave me the knife said so.He claimed that this world was doomed, and that I could save people in a parallel world by killing them in this one."The confused looks on everyone else's faces made it clear I wasn't getting my point across clearly."This knife?"Came the reply as the suited man held up an ordinary kitchen knife."There is nothing special about this knife Mr. Lundgow.We have examined it and found it to be made by Kirkland."He pointed at the logo engraved into the dull blade.I stood up and shouted, "I am a hero dammit!All of those children would have died!"The confusion on the people's faces turned to disgust as the jury remembered why they were here in the first place.I sat down and continued, "Who better to save than the children?They are the purest and most worthy of a life to live don't you agree?""We do Mr. Lundgow.That is why you are here.Because you murdered 127 children.""Saved 127 children sir!"I shouted back.My composure was gone now, but I had saved them and I would not be treated like a criminal for saving lives."You murdered them in their beds Mr. Lundgow.You murdered them on their way home from school, in public restrooms and while they played in the woods.You stole the light and innocence of youth from 127 families.You destroyed the lives of hundreds of people because you are mad Mr. Lundgow.And you will hang for your crimes.""I will hang."I agreed."I will hang with a clean concience knowing I saved as many as this cruel world would let me.If you understood the burden that this..."  I began to cry.It wasn't easy killing children.Saving children.I was trying to speak, but I couldn't.The tears had their way and my lips refused to form words any longer.They all looked at me like I was crazy.But I knew.I knew what I had done was right.I could die with that knowledge.My biggest regret would be that I didn't get to witness this world end, to prove to them that I was right along.They would see though.That I was right.Those parents would thank me when the time came.For saving the children I could.Then I would be viewed as the hero I was.
