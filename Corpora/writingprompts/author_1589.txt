"Hey Fire Guy.""Hey, Jeff."I responded.I've been Fire Guy since i did 40k worth of damage to the building.Then I backed into the CEO's car and somehow walked out with a promotion.I've delegated all my work to all my team and somehow three of them are getting laid off, and  I'm getting another raise.My house burned down when I was 6; and I wished so hard to be 'fireproof', as in 'cannot get burned'.Turns out I can't get terminated.I've been here for six years.Million bucks, million ducks...twelve inch pianist, however that joke goes.Time to do some good.In my right hand I have a Corona, 'cause no one ever seems to care if I drink on the job.in my left hand; I've got a nasty little worm on a USB that's gonna show the world that this company has been laundering money - for who, I don't know and don't care.This baby is on a timer, and I'll be working at my new job before anyone notices.Three weeks later; and I'm still here.I miscalculated some of the coding and not only did the worm burn this company down from the inside, it fired 3 hours after I installed it.Of course ITSEC found my terminal prints all over it because I got lazy and sloppy.My future job called and rescinded my offer - who needs a whistleblowing snitch, am I right?I'm getting death threats and i'm effectively black-balled from working anywhere else.So I'm stuck here; essentially getting a check; getting eternal shade and side eye from all the other sheeple that work here.For a while I didn't mind; but rooms get silent when I walk in, like I'm Death.It takes a toll on a person.I guess that just goes to show that there is more than one way to burn yourself.
