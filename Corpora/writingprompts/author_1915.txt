[Poem]

Dark was the road, 

and Heaven was far 

I went straight to heck

When I crashed my car.I first met the sinners

That of Heck dont get out 

Those ones that they yawn

And dont cover their mouth.And then soon I found

Those who often sought solace

In heating some fish 

In the microwave office.As I went down further

I saw those that spoil it

By carelessly leaving up

The seat of the toilet.Deeper in Heck I went,

And still from afar 

I heard those who parked 

In two slots, their car.Such horrors I saw that day,

That never Id look

Like those who make ears

To a beloved book.Please stop it I begged 

But it wasnt no good

Because there were the sinners 

Taking pics of their food.And then I finally saw

the real demons of Heck:

The ones that compare

Star Wars to Star Trek




So much was I longing to

Go back, and see stars.But dark was the road, 

That in Heck took me far.-
