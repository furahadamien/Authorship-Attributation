May this dossier be discovered by future civilisations and provide some insight into what came to pass to Mankind.Fifty-two years since Provo-cal hit the markets in full.The miracle drug.Mankinds hubris is always so painfully evident in hindsight.Immortality.Since the dawn of mankind something has chased us, but Provo-cal tripped it over.Always just around the corner, but Provo-cal held up a mirror.These were a few of their slogans.Alas, no matter how far or fast you run, it always gets up, and it always catches you.Heed my words: It ALWAYS catches you.I will concede that it was a blissful fifty-two years.With the fear of natural death and aging extinguished, scientific endeavours turned to new, thought provoking avenues.Cosmetic products practically fell off the market, and many young people dont even understand the concept of wearing makeup.Why would you want to look younger? I had my grandson ask me one day.And now hes outside my house.Watching.Waiting.At first, we called them Zombies.Those of us unaffected were old enough to remember the films of George Romero, so this name was used internationally.But it was entirely unsuitable.Zombies are slow moving, mindless, brain eating drones.The Ferals contradicted every aspect of that description.Losing any ability to speak, the only thing they hunger for is the kill.They dont even eat their prey (in fact, we believe they dont even use food to sustain themselves), they just play with it.Its poetic in its own sort of way.Those who cheated death for so long are now its harbingers.Maybe in another time we would have been able to control this.Had it occurred twenty-five years ago it would have been possible to intervene, forty years ago probable to stop, and fifty years ago it wouldnt have even been a problem.But we Survivors are old.Were weary.And in such few numbers, and those of us with the will to live have no means to fight off Ferals who are at their peak physical form.Even with weapons, were aware of our slowed reactions and movements.And so are they.This dossier may be unfortunately read as more of a short story.Story because, even as I write, Im aware of how absurd it would have sounded even five years ago, and short because I hear them upstairs.Eighty-five years was long, but not enough.It always catches.
