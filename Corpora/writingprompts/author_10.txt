Knock knock.Adolf cursed softly and thought not again, he was in the middle of drawing a beautiful stick figure walking amongst some roses.The flowers need work he thought, as he put down his crayons.He peeked out a window and saw a man with large curly hair standing politely at his door.Adolf had moved so many times just to get away from these strange people, dressed in outlandish clothes, he was beginning to think there was some kind of conspiracy against him.The first time someone interrupted his paint by numbers marathon.The guy just busted in his apartment brandishing a knife and swinging.Adolf took him out with a nearby brass table lamp and dumped him in a canal.The second and third time happened a day apart.One lady jumped him as he went out for his morning coffee, then a guy with a strange metallic body suit attempted to poke him with an electric handheld device.In both cases Adolf fought back well enough to run away and hide.Since then he has lost count how many people have tried to kill or harm him.This was his fifth move in as many months, Adolf thought he was finally free.But no, some guy and his awful hair found him.Knock knock, he heard again.Adolf peeked out again and noticed the man was holding a painting easel, maybe this was a fellow painter he thought, probably noticed my monthly cartoon in Fascistbook.Adolf debated whether to let him in for about four seconds then realized he could use a friend.So he opened the door."Hi can I help you.""Hello my friend, actually, I can help you"."I saw your cartoon in Fascistbook and gave them a visit, they said I could probably find you here."Damn, Adolf thought, I told those Semites not to publish my address."Well actually I was just in the middle drawing, but I suppose I could spare but a moment.""Great!The name is Bob Ross.Mind if I bring my easel in?"Adolf thought that was a bit presumptuous, what if he had been  painting with the smelly markers.He liked to draw a little mustachio on his upper lip with the licorice smelling ones and flex in the mirror topless."Sure why not, not like I have anything to do today."Nottt, he thought."Great then.Just be a chap and grab the other end, it's heavy," motioning with the easel.OMG thought Adolf, who does this guy think he is.But he grabbed the easel and walked in with Bob."Welcome to the abode Bob, can I get you a drink, schnapps, tea, a bit of arsenic."He mumbled the last part."No thanks a-dawg, I can't stay long.""In fact, I can only stay for a few minutes, I just wanted to," Bob lifted up the easel, "paint a happy sunset."And with that Bob swung the easel around and smashed Adolf in the head, splattering blood all over his stick figure and roses drawing."Ah, just a little bit of gentle red in the background, a quick smear here, and done, calmly observe your beautiful work of art."
