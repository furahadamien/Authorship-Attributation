A bookcase floated before me.I had taken a cursory glance over the first of the matching volumes to discover the old instructions of a choose your own adventure novel that I hadn't seen since elementary school.I flipped through several pages of nonsense before catching sight of something about a lemon that I recognized from an old story mom would always tell about me.It occurred to me immediately what these volumes were.So now I've just been floating here with it.Not reading yet.Still lamenting that I did end up being doomed to spend eternity in an afterlife after all.But also trying to compile all the what ifs I had been asking myself over the years.This system was rather inconvenient.I didn't want to work my way from the beginning, I just wanted to know outcomes of certain scenarios, and I wouldn't remember the steps I took to get to those decisions in the first place.I tried to sleep on a strategy.Not sure it worked, or how much time passed while my eyes were closed, but when I opened them, there was now a computer and only one book.I glanced down at the book, lying open, and saw a recounting of a rather tender moment, but was also able to verify that I did indeed know a certain someone at that point, despite having forgotten that I had ever spoken to them not a decade later.I move over to the computer monitor and am greeted with a lovely file system organized by year.Excellent.Glad to see that the bookcase does have the capacity to shift forms.I greedily open up the folder for grade 7, am greeted with more folders, this time listing categories.Click into the romance folder, and I'm now given a series of multiple choice questions in a new window.I see all the situations are written in purple text, and the choices I had made originally were underlined in purple.I find the first question of curiosity, the first secret love letter I got.I change the response to "keep quiet" and notice that some scenarios vanish, with new ones in green appearing in their place.A flutter attracts my attention to the book in time to see it rest on the page in question as some of the text fades and is replaced.Excitedly I check to see if I called her out on it when she said she heard I got one.And true to my original choice, I remained quiet.No worries, I can change that choice too.I glance at the screen...and no choice exists.I flip through the book in confusion, only to discover that I was just to naive to put two and two together in the first place.Lovely.I hit restore defualts and proceed to run experiments.First, each change of decision introduces new colours.This gets complicated past 10 changes trying to keep track of which shades came from which choices, but whatever.Also, the book now flips to the stage in life that will answer whatever question I had.Efficiency.Two girls I could have dated.Both of which I was too hesitant due to my own lack of knowledge.Both of which fell into drugs in high school.I test what happens with each.One of them, we dated for a bit before she broke up with me and ended up in drugs anyway.That's a relief I guess.Other one, oh yikes, I ended up in drugs too.Wasn't expecting that to happen.Tried making decisions to lead me down more creative endeavours than I had actually chosen.Mixed results.Seems I was never really satisfied there.I'd get lots of better things accompanied with worse things.Sometimes the book would noticeably shrink too.It got even more harrowing when I started playing around with the choices during university.About half of them resulted in the book shrinking.Particularly any choice that moved towards parental dependence.I mean, I joked about that a lot after moving out, but I don't think I ever realized just how much potential for it actually existed.Tried out different cities for when I left my hometown.Ultimately still ended up in the same place no matter my choice, but it was interesting how things during that intermediary period got altered.Seemed that I had picked the middle path in terms of happiness and success for my late 20s.Finally with the most what ifs out of the way, I took a breath and set out on the last of these projects, the one I was saving for last, because I knew it would take the longest.I find my way to the day my university girlfriend broke up with me.I change the response I gave just before then, check out the book...

...and start working backwards.
