50 long years.Thomas rolled out of his bunk.Today was the day America was going to join the rest of the world.He was excited, but a little afraid.As an American, it had been schooled into him that what had happened 51 years prior was one of the largest wars known, World War III, and that America had been the first to strike.In 2028, the leaders of the remaining nations had all agreed, each country was to go into isolation.No trade, communication, or aid, whatsoever.America had agreed, and had built massive walls in the North and South.They had severed communication with all satellites, and cut all lines outside of the US.Alaska was given to Canada, and Hawaii was allowed to be its own nation once more.Puerto Rico had protested at first, but soon gave up.According to his grandpa, the US suffered the first couple of years.Technology development had gone down, with agriculture having a huge boom to support its population.Most people left the cities, leaving them to become ruins.The only cities that thrived were towards the center of the country.This made life very simple.You attended school until 12, and then you picked a specialization.There were three to choose from.You could be a farmer, which was the most noble and useful, a rememberer, whose job was to learn all of the old things, so when the walls came down, we could talk to our neighbors and work old technology, and soldiers, who were those who didnt have what it took to do the other things.Thomas wasnt ashamed to be a soldier, he couldnt grow a potato, and words and numbers annoyed him.Besides, he would be one of the first to see a Canadian.He grabbed his issued jackhammer, and headed for his station.At midnight, walls started coming down.Within the next two days, they were nothing more than rubble, that was quickly being removed.Oddly, there had been nobody to greet them, but this had been anticipated seeing as how had caused most of the damage in the war.In the next three days, the American military had sent out ambassador convoys North into Canada, and South to Mexico, neither had found anything except countries being reclaimed by nature.Almost two weeks later, the rememberers had finally reestablished communication of the one satellite they had been allowed to keep in orbit.North Americas whole portion of the globe was dark.Thomas kept rereading the communal paper, surely they were not the only ones left?The next day, they got the answers they were looking for.Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia were also dark.Thomas, and many other Americans wept.Edit: Figured I would mass respond to this.The ending was left open to interpretation, kind of like a Miyazaki film.
