"As we just reported from Mayor Riddle's press conference, he just can't let the community lose it's young bloods any longer.He's aggressively targeted Butcher Street, otherwise known as Hogwarts by it's homeless crowd of addicts.The police force is led by new Commissioner Snape, who succeeded Malfoy last week.Malfoy couldn't keep up his efforts after his son..." 

Rita Skeeter trailed on, but the three teens could care less listening to her voice and picture from the television.They had got their new high, Mortis, and were lost to the world as mere breathing shells.Ron and Harry just stared up the ceiling, with nothing on their minds and their mouths zipped.This was Hermione's magic - to get a new drug and make a cocktail of it.She lay parallel to their heads, and her high just started to end.For as long they remembered their first high together, they had stuck around.In fact, Harry had gotten popular around the streets of Hogwarts - the Boy Who Lived.The only one who escaped rehab after getting caught by Mayor Riddle.Word spread around when Harry met the Giant and got his stash sorted."Escaped rehab in mere 11 days" said the Giant to Dumbledore.Dumbledore was half-shocked but more happy to hear it.His no.1 customer was on the street again.After their high was done, the teens met Dumbledore at their usual."Right, Prof Dumbledore, you have a new DADA professor?"asked Harry.When Quirell was exposed as an informant, his death was instant.Harry slipped a high cocktail in his beer before exposing him.Quirell died, but his face looked very dehydrated, very dry.Forensics remarked that he had probably perspired more in an hour than in his entire lifetime.Harry renewed his 'legend' license again."Yeah, I got a guy.Called Moony.Experienced with everything" replied Dumbledore."You know what?For bein' the goddamn best druggie, 50 points to Gryffins!""You mean Gryffindor?"replied Ron."Yeah, that.Now you's wait for Moony.He's to meet at Diagonal Alley.Got all you need.""Merlin, that's awesome!"yelled Hermione, before slumping down and leaning behind the brick wall."Yeah, let's wait for class to start" said Harry, and he slumped down with her.Dumbledore didn't care and ran off Rosmerta's.If what he heard was true, he knew the mad-cat Mini would be there with some haul.As he turned the corner block, he saw them cops.He ran back with his trolley to those darn teens."OI!Copper's here!Better buzz off... Well, fuck."The three were already started with their high, and Moony sat right opposite them, slumped against the wall.He was checking their wallets for whatever valuable he could find."Fuckin' hell.Potter's mighty broke, the bushy brown girl got just some pennies with her and the red ball sack literally held a freakin rat by his tail callin' him Scabbers... My Patronus ain't cheap, you old lug!""You want your no.1 customer safe?Help me get him out... Coppers on the corner," said Dumbledore.He turned to the teens and screamed, "OI, Dementors here, be ready!""Yeah, Prof. Lupin taught us the Patronus Charm!"screamed Harry, that ensured all the cats yowling would scare the birds and ravens on the wires.Dumbledore heard more footsteps and knew the coppers coming in.Moony was getting Hermione stand.The office immediately lunged from the corner and got his baton out."Well, well.The legend of Butcher Street," he snarled.His companions, male and female, were behind block the way out."RUN!"Dumbledore followed Moony, dragging along his trolley for now.But the teens were on their feet, walking towards the cops."My dad... he was a stag... Espeto Partonom!"Harry shouted all this with his eyes closed and arm outstretched with the syringe, as if it was stick in his hand.Ron and Hermione were doing the same."Extepo Parnonum..." 

"Espexo Pranum!"In one lunge, the cop got their syringes out of their hands and knocked them out with the baton.He put in a call for the van to haul them off and handcuffed them in."Bloody homeless turd Dumble..."
