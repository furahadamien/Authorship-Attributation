I've never experienced death on such a drastic level.I've grown over the eons with swings between mercy and compassion, or hate paired wirh enjoyment of bringing other's their doom.I always thought I felt power and purpose in bringing death, but with so many dead, I now realize that my power lies in their life.I still have a purpose to fulfill, and can not force people to suffer.But I can help those that are left.How did I once feel power from bringing people their death?I think I focused on it, and was able to bring such death.I found power in my ego of being successful.All along I knew I couldn't kill everyone and move on, somewhere deep inside.But I've really gone and fucked it this time, so few survivors.My abilities are so limited now.I can still kill animals for them.I can still transfer life energy from one to another, and in rare cases animals to humans.We are all interconnected.And life begets life.I wasted so much life.To now understand we are reliant on one another, like a match to a log, the flame goes out immediately if the log remains uncut and unavailable to the match.We need each other to keep the flame alive.I am not the bringer of death, I am the..... Guide during a passage.Our life recycles, one way or another.Eventually.We only die when we kill each other.Death is inevitable.Accidents are inevitable.But to bring death early and cruely is a missed opportunity for something beautiful.For life to exist out of atoms.Surviving is attained through force and protection.Life is built from openness and vulnerability.To experience life.But we don't always survive our experiences.I was a cold chill that represented death, and I am showing them that the cold chill can now mean bringer of life.As I help guide, feed.I encourage the openness.The vulnerability.To be in the cold.The cold that is to touch and feel death.Teaching them that to touch and feel death is to finally acknowledge your life.Because your life is not your survival, it is your experience.While I set these people up for failure, I will become the bringer of life through death, rather than the bringer of death to only end suffering.Cold chills will be associated all their lives with positive experiences.Guiding them to life, before the last moment bringing death.But death is only a passage of time.Eventually you will become part of someone else.Lots of people one day will walk around with part of you inside them.The hard parts, the risks in life...They are what life is.Everything else is survival.It has taken time, but I have been guiding them.Dragging them together.Getting them to cooperate, and they have begun to call me life.The cold chill of life.How ironic when I am actually the bringer of death...I suppose it's not ironic when I was only the bringer of death.I still lead people to a result that ends in death, but no longer with intent.I don't have the power to stop random acts of violence, but I do have the power to nudge people to trust, to open up, to have faith in others long enough to grow.As helpers of all.And if I can get them over the hump, surviving again, maybe there's hope for all of us after all...
