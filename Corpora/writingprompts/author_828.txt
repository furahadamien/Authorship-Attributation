"Oh God...Please...I don't wanna die!"Mark had been hanging here for what felt like days.He was beyond exhausted.Weak from dehydration and hunger, his bite had moved beyond excruciating pain; his leg felt like it was on fire.It was too much.He was delirious from fever and the poison in his veins.His blurry vision darkened as spots swam in his vision.Finally, the last ounce of a strength fed by the pure need to survive faded.His arms gave.Mark had one last insane thought before gravity overcame him and he plummeted down the cliff face, "There never was a tomorrow."And then he fell."So you're sure he's going to be alright Doctor Whitner?"Stacy asked.Her younger brother had disappeared on a group camping trip, only to be found a week later alive, barely, at the bottom of a thousand foot drop.He was immediately air lifted to the closest hospital."Yes, Miss Anderson.He should be awake any time now.He's remarkably well, all thing taken into account.Mark must have an angel looking out for him.From what I can tell from his injuries it seems as if something must have broke his fall.Possibly multiple times."Honestly it's astonishing.He survived the fall with mostly only scrapes and few cracked ribs.Other than the snake bite.We're weren't sure we would be able save the leg, but thanks to whomever had the wherewithal to take the time to treat it on site, he should still have all his original parts when he leaves."It's the oddest thing though.When the air ambulance brought him in, he was absolutely covered in some kind of silk threads."
