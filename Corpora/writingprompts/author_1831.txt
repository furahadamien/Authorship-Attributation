Luck governs our lives more than most care to admit.Those born with high luck scores become world leaders, wealthy, and succeed where others fail.Those born with lower scores often lead unlucky lives and often fall victim to unfortunate accidents.Me I was one of the luckest of all, a 100, from a young age everyone knew I was destined for greatness.One teacher in school said I might me the next president, another the next Bill Gates.However I was always a risk taker and loved pushing my luck to its limits.When I was 16 I robbed my first bank, the vault door was left wide open, the security camera's out from a freak outage.It was a thrill to temp fate.Over the years I used my luck to make bank, I could enter the most secure places and make off like a king.That is until one day the impossible happened, I got unlucky, caught red handed with the Crown Jewels of England.I was tried and sentenced to life in a maximum security prison.Though this too thrilled me, as a prison break may be the most challenging task yet to press my high luck.Only when the guard locked me in my cell, what I saw was impossible.All the other inmates in my block all had luck scores of 100 just like myself.No matter what I tried my luck failed me, no open doors, no power outages, no holes in security opening up for me to exploit.I learned from my cell mates that my story was theirs, they lived a life of improbable luck until one unlucky day they ended up here.Nothing anyone tried could free them from this prison.This place was built so that nothing could get out.However what I failed to understand at the time is that we where the lucky ones, nothing could get out of this place, but that also meant nothing could get in.Outside our iron corner of the world things where falling apart.Talks where breaking down and war was on the horizon, soon everything would be destroyed.Except for the most fortified places on this Earth, like say a maximum security prison.
