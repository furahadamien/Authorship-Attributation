The intake was as expected - a bit rough, a little too handsy, and a small inkling that the guard liked me a bit more than was necessary.I'd heard of full body cavity searches, hosed down with icy cold water, being pushed naked and wet into rooms of other people.You know, general Hollywood type stuff.I managed through pretty quickly.While I WAS searched and hosed, the water was warm and the search not too thorough.When my papers had been finished they dropped me into the general population out in the yard, sun shining on our banana yellow jumpsuits.Jailed for being lucky - what a crock.I doubted I would be there long, things always went my way and I had no intention of rotting in a cell for the rest of my life.Luck rating tests were given out to every 18 year old.It was presumed that before that your rating could fluctuate too much, and stabilized in your 17th year.Nobody knew what happened to the 100s - well, I do now - and I assume all the 1s died pretty early in life.Such is luck.A rather handsome man walked up to me, standing awkwardly in the middle of a bare patch of ground.His smile was warm, and he genuinely didn't seem to be much of a criminal.Not many of them did."Another 100!Welcome!"He broke into a trot, and held his hand out to mine."Been a while since the last, figured it was starting already."What was starting?"I asked, taking his hand cautiously."Why have none of you left yet?"He shrugged."None of us want to.Free food, free housing, comfortable rooms, the food isn't THAT bad, and a constant routine that changes just enough to not drive us crazy.It's nice."He motioned to the rest of the inmates.Odd groups here and there, there seemed to be about 20 of us."As for what's about to start..." He paused, and grinned like he was about to drop the punchline to a big joke."I guess you'll see.Any day now."Fade - yes, he legally changed his name to Fade - seemed to be the most outgoing of the 100s in the prison.The guards were more relaxed around him, the other inmates joked with him, and he got extra food in the canteen.A natural leader, where I preferred to stick to the shadows.A perfect first friend to have, since I hated the attentive eyes of the Warden.It was the fourth day after I arrived that the sky started to fall.
