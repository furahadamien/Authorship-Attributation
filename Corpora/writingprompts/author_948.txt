"I was late, and it could fly."I shifted nervously in my seat and reached for a glass of water that I had already drained.The team from HR didn't respond right away, so I had time to fill my glass and drink again before I went on."I realize that's not a great excuse for why there's a fire-breathing Nightmare Pony parked in my space, but my car broke down, I had a really important meeting, and well...Mister Pibbles was all I could think of."The HR lady found her voice."Mister Pibbles?You call it Mister Pibbles?""Actually, my daughter named him.He was kind of a Christmas present.It's really kind of a funny story, although maybe not in this room, at this particular..."

"Is it dangerous?""Oh god yes," I answered before I really had time to think.Then I had to try and backtrack."I mean, he's always potentially dangerous, but so are big dogs, right?He wouldn't hurt family, and he shouldn't be a danger to random strangers as long as he's got his soul bag on..."

I kind of trailed off at that point, worried that some bright spark in the HR department would ask me how I manage to fill a pony-sized feed bag full of human souls.Fortunately, no one did."I'm really sorry about this, but can I just take him home?"The big boss spoke up, trying to maintain an air of authority, as his personal view of the universe crumbled quietly around him."I'm about this close to calling the police, or locking that thing up where it can't hurt anybody."I shook my head."Bad idea.Very bad idea.Please do not interact with Mister Pibbles.Don't pet him, don't move him, and whatever you do, don't ASK HIM for anything!In fact, it's best if you don't wish for anything really specific when you're close to him.If he's feeling playful he might try to get it for you and we really do not want a repeat of the birthday kitten situation.""How did you end up with this creature in the first place?""Reading may be fundamental, sir, but proper spelling can save your soul."
