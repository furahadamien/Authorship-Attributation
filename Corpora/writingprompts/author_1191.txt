She was lying in bed, sick as a dog, scrolling through Reddit and trying to keep down the water she'd drank.She came across a strange writing prompt.As she read she saw that it was actually uplifting and though she still physically felt like she'd been in a Disney teacups ride that'd gone through a woodchipper, she smiled."Thanks, stranger.You too."And then she promptly threw her phone down and ran to the bathroom to puke again.She came back and wrote the last few words...Really, thanks.
