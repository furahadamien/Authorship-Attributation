Whoosh!It was like Id just dropped down to earth from outer space with a great thud.I looked around the tiny, empty little hotel room that I was calling home for the night.I finally felt alive again.I looked at my arm where the syringe was still hanging out.An empty small plastic bag was beside me.Straight away I felt like more.That was the best trip Id ever been on.I called my dealer and asked him to bring over another hit.Whats it called again? I asked him over the phone.Nexdoxtrolone he replied.That was three months ago.And now here I am.Sleeping on a bench just down the street from my dealer, panhandling during the day just to get enough money for my next hit.My life had been slowly going this way over the past two years.First it was m&ms I got hooked on, then Dr Pepper, the alcohol and then I found my best friend, Nextdoxtrolone.Its all I have now but my life as the worlds best race car driver had become boring and repetitive.This drug, my one true friend, allowed me to go to so many places, do so many things.All of the trips were so real and during them I still had freewill to guide my imagination whatever direction I liked.My life had become so much better in these last three months.But there was one side effect.After that first hit that created a trip that felt like days, the trips had become increasingly shorter, and I had to go longer without for my next hit.It was beginning to give me physical withdrawal symptoms and freaky thoughts.Thoughts that I only had one choice to make, to become a race car driver.Thoughts that Id lost someone, something.Thoughts that I didnt really belong.Then one day the inevitable finally happened.My trip didnt last long enough and it was taking too long to panhandle enough money.I was getting increasingly desperate, shaking, mumbling, crying.Then I passed out on my bench.Whoosh!I woke up, on that same bench, with a sudden epiphany.I whipped  VR goggles off my face and looked up to see my parents standing over me.So how did it feel, being a race car driver? my dad asked.I looked at him, shaking.Dad, I need some money.I need to get some more Nexdoxtrolone. My heart raced, I mumbled, cried and collapsed to the floor unconscious, my ten year old body convulsing.I awake in a hospital bed.I try to move, but cant.I try to talk, but cant.I hear the slow beep of machines and then my mom, crying.A calm voice, must be a doctor, says Im sorry maam, theres nothing we can do.His body is shutting down.Hes got all of the hallmarks of a severe shock from a drug withdrawal, but we cant find any traces of anything in his system.His organs are shutting down.You must prepare for the worst, it wont be long now.
