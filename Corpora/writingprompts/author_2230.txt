Day 0985 of the Hendari Expedition:

It has been sometimes since our last update to the Council, the QEC was damaged after a slight miscalculation of our ships FTL vector.Thankfully Chief Engineer Hans was able to repair the QEC with minimal expenditure, and has added some shielding in case similar incident, but none the less, seeing as it is my duty to double check ever calculation made by Chief Navigator Ellieen, I take full responsibility for the three weeks of silence and any panic this may have caused.To quickly summarize the goings on of the last few weeks, all systems and supplies are within projected conditions  and there has yet to be any change as to the time of our return.As too our finds we have found one more garden world perfectly suitable for colonization, two black holes within acceptable parameters for Event Horizon energy production,  three dozen gas giants rich in He3, as well as two hundred and five mineral rich planets.Individual classing tables as well as coordinates also included of course.But the most interesting finding is the detection of artificial radio waves arriving from the opposite direction of our space.In preparation for the potential first contact, the black box is being kept up to date on a by the hour basis, the translation technology is undergoing checks for any glitches or disrepair and the diplomats on board are being on high alert at all times in case we encounter any other ships.Du bist ein Kind,

Day 0986 of the Hendari Expedition:

Our findings are... less optimistic than we had hoped.Eighteen hours ago our engineers had pinpointed the exact system from which the signals originated, five hours ago we arrived within the system and a quick scan revealed nine garden worlds within the system, as well as three spaceport like structures clocking the entirety of the gas giants within the system.That was not an error in the QEC that Chief Engineer Hans overlooked, all our telescopes, state of the art need I not remind you, found the nine planets a mix of green and purple urban, clearly showing colonization and habitation, as well as three much larger planets completely covered by a long sheet of purple metal buildings.One could attribute the purple as a color preference of the species and considering the rarity of garden worlds, with the Nigel system, possessing the previous highest number of garden worlds found in a single system, sporting only three garden worlds, this is either a great anomaly or these people possess terraforming technology centuries ahead of the most recent developments at the Templin Institute.And seeing the flying cities encapsulating the gas giants, I would bet it be the latter of the possibilities.But this is the unsettling part, even though we found tens of thousands of ships in the system, not a single one responded to our hails, even the planets and flying cities ignored our calls.Wearily, I dispatched a shuttle of marines as well diplomats to the nearest planet and they found the streets completely empty, great plazas and labyrinths left abandoned,

And while we might attribute this simply to a system hastily abandoned before the Star exploded, scans show the Star of the system still boasts millions of years within its lifetime.And after a direct command by myself to ascend the tower which shadowed planet, they found only found a small symbol on the very top of the tower, easily identified by its metallic color contrasting with the purple of the city.The image of the symbol is attached to the log.At that moment one of the marines tried to scratch the purple surface of the city, and bring back a sample, the scientists who examined it found long strings of DNA within the proteins that make it up.It is their working theory that this is the blood of an advanced life form, and although gene mapping will take a while yet, almost all the scientist suspect they will find the Milch-34 strand, which as they explain it to me, is the strand found in species that boast sapience.We will continue landings on the garden worlds and giants, and await the gene mapping, the Blackbox is now being updated by the minute and I have dedicated much crew effort into insuring the warp device within activates.I would also advice some military preparation be taken.Ich seid die Kinder,

Day 996:

You will notice this report will not contain much in the way of formaility or proper etiquette and I must apologize.As I have said in my last report, we have continued to go deeper into this systems, everyday our engineers are more amazed by the technology and circuitry they find and the entire crew shudders as we bypass dozens of blood soaked perfectly terraformed planets, flying cities and massive spaceports.As usual we attempt hailing in every system, but two minutes ago, something unusual happened.One of the ships responded.And though translation software has yet to decipher the message, I can only fear what it might hold.Our navigators detect a ship they claim to be fifty million kilometers long heading towards us, they detect it is made of organic rather than synthetic material, and it will arrive in a few minutes.I truly hope this is not my final log, but if it is, tell my daughter, no matter how cold and distant I was and no matter how much she might hate me, I always loved you and have been proudest father in world.Lukas

Okay... so the idea initially was to just have abandoned human systems numbering in the thousands cause they ascended somewhere or died out, then I couldnt think of an ending, so it was humans who went extinct because of some threat, but I felt that was against the premise of the prompt so it became humans ascended into god like things that drive species extinct and paint their planets with blood?I feel like it could have been better, but the Duolingo bird is getting pissy with me and Im getting tired so that was all I came up with.Also, I feel like it would be better if i added another log to give them some reason to be afraid of the organic monstrosity at the end, but; hey.First drafts will suck anyway, so Im just rolling with it.Edit, rereading the prompt, I feel like I might have stepped out of the premise, and logs from the archeology team sent into abandoned human systems might have been better but, this took me like an hour so good enough?Edit2, okay, I thought this might get buried, but at least like 12 people have read it, so for any future readers, the thing I like about this style of stories, ie prompts is it gets a lot of stories out fast so critiscm can be heard and stuff can actually improve, and the writer cant take anything personally cause they invested so little time into it.Soooo anyone else, whats the biggest narrative or writing failing in this?
