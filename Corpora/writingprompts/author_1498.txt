How?It didnt seem real, or possible.But as I looked down upon the cigarette, it made me wonder.How is it that I can still purchase and acquire cigarettes?As the last man (allegedly) to smoke them, it made me ponder.The street smelt of ash as I flicked the remnants towards the street.She will smell it, I mused.It never made me wonder, until now.I see many ads.I dont think about the consequences.It doesnt make sense, I thought as my apartment came into view.The door sild open.How was the day, she said.Fine, I felt.It was great, I said.It couldnt escape my mind that the new quit smoking ads seemed out of place.Suddenly, I felt a tug.Violently I was pulled back into a bright light.Quiet!The voice screamed.The light became brighter.I could feel my insides begin to tighten.A voice said, It is time to reset his mind, to make him believe he is the only one to still smoke  and it is his duty to continue this noble deed. Finally, I realized.I live the same day over-and-over again.To the dismay of many, to the benefit of a few.The light dimmed out of view.
