First were the plagues....

Boils and bleeding sores for "So that means it's free right?"Biting and burrowing insects for disrespecting the express lane.Eternal tinnitus for letting their children loose in the toy department.And of course, bleeding from the eyes for Black.Friday.Maniacs.Not the chill "Camp out for three days" motherfuckers, nah - they're cool, you get to wondering about their mental health, but they respect the rules of the game.First come, first serve.Black fridays perpetual code.No.The maniacs are the ones who show up five hours after opening throwing a tantrum about the doorbusters being gone.Screaming for a manager to let them return something that had been bought years before, trying to exploit the madness.And then, the massive uptick in receipt shoppers.All of them would weep blood until december 27th.Wearing their shame, unable to go out in public once their fellow man realized what it meant.They would suffer as I had suffered.Eternally - and without mercy.Thank you for shopping here with us in hell, where the customer always gets what they deserve.
