&nbsp;As I step up onto the chair, I give the rope one more tug to make sure it will hold.It has been a hell of a year, in an even longer decade, all wrapped up in a miserable life."Well I guess I don't have all day" I mutter to myself.Wait, what day is it actually?I ponder that thought for a moment and then glance at my watch.I can barely make out through my tears the tiny numbers telling me that today is December 25th."Oh shit, it's Christmas" I say, letting the words fill my empty room with unexpected sound.I wonder if maybe I shouldn't do this, maybe I should wait until tomorrow, or the next day.&nbsp;

&nbsp;However, time waits for no man, and *now* is my time.I slip the noose over my head and take a deep breath.As I take a small, tentative step forward, the chair creaks, the old wood begging to let go.Just a little longer buddy, and then the weight will be eased.Out of the corner of my eye, I can see my computer screen, I can see a little orange letter in the corner of my browser telling me that I just got a message on Reddit.Probably not important, just another troll.Confidently now, I step out and let the drop take me.Edit: I just wanted to say that this in no way reflects my actual state of mind or being, I just wanted to do a little bit of a different response to the prompt, so don't worry.But there are people out there that I am sure appreciated this prompt, and that it isn't too late for.Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!(also formatting, it was originally written on mobile)
