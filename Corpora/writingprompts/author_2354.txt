-Are you sure about this thing?-I told you a thousand times that it's going to work just fine, so for the love of science, please stop worrying about it!-Well, Sall, if you say so.I just don't understand how you can be so relatively calm about it.Nobody ever done that, and yet, here you are, about to make one of the most important discoveries in the history of humanity and you didn't even flinch...He suddenly stopped fixing the machine, approached me and deeply sighed.-Look at my hands, Barry.I am shaking as a teenager before my first date.I am worried too.But scientists have to be brave if they want the world to move forward.I have to be brave.For my parents, my family and all the other people who helped me to pull it off.Especially, you, my friend.Without your genius mind, this experiment would have never been accomplished.-I just gave you a theory.You build this machine by yourself.It is, by all means, your accomplishment, so if you get lost somewhere deep below in a space and time continuum, don't try to blame me!-Hahah, well, that was quite encouragement from your side, thank you.He pushed some buttons on the panel of his machine and the countdown has started.His face suddenly became serious.-If anything bad happens, take care of Emilia and the kids for me.Who knows what can happen there...
-Don't dramatize.You'll be back in two days top, if my theory is correct.-Just promise me.-...Yes.Of course.The countdown was reaching it's end.-Well, it's time to go for me.I wish you good luck, my friend.When I'll get back, drinks on me!-Heh, I'll remember that!We shook hands.His machine has launched a huge portal the size of the wall of our laboratory and he went towards it.He made a decisive step right into it and almost instantly was completely consumed by the portal.The small step for a man...

My best friend, Sullivan Kendrick, has just became the first man to time travel.It took me some time to deal with his machine and close the portal as he instructed, check the lab and get home.The only thing left now is to wait two days.
