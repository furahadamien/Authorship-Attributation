It was a routine call - at least, that's how it had started out.Our ambulance screamed down to Sheepshead bay, where a woman had called from, panicking about her husband.She had been having a normal conversation with him when he began to complain about terrible chest pains and nausea.*I mean, he's still walking around, complaining, but I'm scared something is going to happen to him!*

Don't worry, ma'am.We'll take care of your husband.He'll be just fine.Maybe not the best thing to say to her in retrospect, considering that heart attack victims often do *not* turn out fine - but if this was his first time, his chances might not be so bad.In fact, once we got there, he seemed stable again - so not a total infarction.But his wife insisted that he go with us, just in case, and get everything checked out.Anyway, as I said - pretty routine.But then I saw their child.She was maybe five or six old.Big, green eyes, framed by choppy brown hair, peered at my team from the doorway.I smiled and waved at her to come closer, thinking that maybe she was scared and I could calm her down.She, of course, scampered out of sight - but not before I caught a glimpse of her arm.My heart got caught in my throat.I muttered some quick excuse about looking for a bathroom and darted out of the living room.The girl hadn't gone far; she was sitting on the bottom rung of a nearby staircase, still trying to eavesdrop.Upon seeing me appear out of nowhere, she yelped a little and ran up the stairs a bit before glancing back at me, like an unsure cat.I just stood there, transfixed in horror."John, what's wrong?"It was Emily, one of my fellow paramedics.She had followed me."Is there a problem?"I limply lifted an arm and pointed."Look at her.*Poor thing*."She peered at the girl, who stared back at us and crawled a little closer, curiosity overriding her initial fear."Oh, John.Are you worried about how she's feeling right now?Because of her dad?""Her dad?"I had forgotten about the father completely."The one who just had chest pains?"Emily rolled her eyes."Anyway, that's sweet of you, but I think you're overreacting a little--"

"No, no, you misunderstand," I cut in."I mean - look at her!Her skin!My God, she must have had it for weeks.How could the parents have not taken her to the hospital already?""Huh?"Emily grunted."And what a brave girl she is, too," I bemoaned."So strong, even in these late stages.Why, the meningoencephalitis must've already begun."Emily sighed."John, what are you talking about?"I blinked at her."Are - are you serious?Do you not see the rash all over her body?The *pustules*?We shouldn't just be standing here chatting while she's dying from typhus!"I lowered my voice at the end; no telling if the little girl was in the state of delirium yet.In any case, best not to alarm her.Emily gawked at me in disbelief.Then, she turned to the little girl and and called out: "Hi, you cute thing!So how long have you had chicken pox?""Four days," she replied.Then she grinned, showing one missing front tooth."Mommy said I get to miss the whooole next week of school.""Chicken pox?"I echoed.Emily tugged on my sleeve."Honestly, John, you're so smart sometimes, but - typhus?What the hell?I don't know if there's a single case of typhus in New York since the 1800s or something.Come on, let's go.We have a job to do, remember?The dad that you've apparently forgotten all about?"&#x200B;
