Malachhamavet
I am that which is because it isn't, I am the void that encompasses everything.I'm not usually this grandiose but I believe I severely overestimated how grounded they kept me, all those souls I encountered, roughly 1 every 5 seconds coming to me exiting this world and a new soul being granted a shell every 3 seconds.These days I'm lucky to find a soul a week and births have become so exceedingly rare that I sometimes wonder if I will revert soon.You see something like me is sustained by the passing of that rare electromagnetism called the soul.All creatures have one and every time they pass it filters through me and spins the appropriate wheel and keeps the appropriate gears turning.My evolution to this point was mainly predicated on the fact that the human psyche has influenced me so much that I've become somewhat human myself, At least my mind but now I can feel the souls of the bugs outweighing the human and somewhere in my deepest recesses I feel a clacking,chittering growing mind, barely aware but learning.If something doesn't change I fear I will become an unthinking abstract again.Today I was seen by a man with a child.My mind is beginning to regress, they shouldn't have saw me at all but it's hard to keep focus when the chatter inside gets this loud.I suppose that could also explain what happened next.The man begged for water and help.I am death, I am the Malachhamavet, I have watched so many souls beg for anything imaginable within the human experience, I never helped any of them save for the way I universally would and could anyway by touch of my embrace and that sweet ending they so often expect to come with a bang when the reality could barely be called a whisper.I was never cruel, I was never kind, I was the true neutral and I went back on millennia of no interference for this one man and one child.The small canteens of water saved them from this desert.Everywhere is a desert now I suppose since they dropped their bombs on each other.When he asked my name I did not lie and he only thought I was half crazy for saying such a thing.Three days later he came to me with a question, I know such things are important to humans so these were called henry and Diane respectively.Henry asked me "how I had so much water when I carried no bag or gear on my person."I told him" he already knew the answer" 

Henry responded in a queer way, he broke down on his knees crying which greatly upset his tiny companion.Henry said " if you can do that than why don't you help?!What's stopping you?If God gave a fuck wouldn't he be here too?!Please if anything happens to me take care of Diane.She's got no one besides me."I looked over to the small one named Diane and I made a confession. "As long as you remain in my company you will not die, nor can harm be done to either of you."Henry stopped crying for the first time in minutes after hearing that.He just stared and said " thank you, thank you, thank you."I lost count of how many times he said it and I felt a feeling of pity for these creatures as they lay here dirty and half mad from my revelations.I needed a moment to myself so I went to a nearby hill to gaze out to the wastes before me not so unlike the void from which I myself was birthed.That's when I heard the shots.Three humans, two males and a female had entered our camp which sadly consisted of some simple sheet metal arranged in a box and a Fire.That was when I felt the two souls sublimate into my being but I put them back in their shells and in but a moment I found myself face to face with the three that had tried to cheat death out of his company.I felt it may be counterproductive to reap the three so instead I simply reached into their minds and left them as blank shells.Marionettes really now, hollowed out and ready to receive what will be given.I did another thing for the first time I had once sworn I never would.I brought three souls back.The mother of Diane, one of Henry's brothers and a random decent soul I found screaming in the void.The reunion was a strange one filled with my speaking of how they were back as much as it was filled with tears of happy reunion.Something else too, Henry's brother and the one I found screaming felt incomplete and soon expressed why.They missed the others they'd lost and in that moment I found myself missing the ones gone more and more.After much thought I'd decided I would find indecent souls and reap them but do what I did here and replace them with the decent ones that were lost or in time find a way to create life myself.Diane has grown on me tremendously, I fear what my presence does to these beings though and fear my acts repercussions on them even more.They've taken to proclaiming me their God, a titles neither want nor can accept, Diane has taken to calling me life and that makes me feel the emotion of joy more than it should.That's why I've decided once it's built up enough to continue on its own, this new society, new humanity we are building is stained by my touch will be rid of me.Since I cannot die being an abstract entity and all I will divide myself amongst the remainder of life on this planet and universe with the majority of myself inhabiting henry and Diane.There were always meant to be two of us.Even abstracts know loneliness once they gain sentience.Myself and the one called God were such once, she so beautiful that even now I see her in every facet of creation.The Big Bang they speak of was her death, a necessity for this universe being born.She split herself into everything, that was the moment I lost my light.All the stars born from her could not begin to equal what I saw and felt with her and so I will sacrifice myself to save her creation.My recent actions have made clear I cannot simply watch anymore and the kind of power that resides in me will eventually SnapBack and do as much bad as good I have accomplished in an effort to balance the scales."This is the only answer Diane, you know everything I do, you are everything I am.You are the new scales, the new balance."
