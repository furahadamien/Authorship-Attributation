The therapist had asked three times."Are you sure you have not been taking any psychoactive drugs?"I had not.Nor would I for as long as these so called *pseudohallucinations* persisted.I was not crazy.Even so, each time one occurred I questioned my sanity after.A slightly darker blob moving against the dark of night sometimes.A will-o-wisp at the corner of my vision during the day.A vague whisper of malice on the back of my neck; like an ice cube held within a hairs width of the skin.Sudden spikes of adrenaline and paranoia, as if my body knew something my mind could not grasp.Incomprehensible empathy for the ants the neighbors' kids were burning with a magnifying glass.It was maddening at times.Others it was simply confusing.Like right now.I had driven this route through D.C. a couple dozen times before.Yet somehow I could not remember my turn.Each time; just as I knew the intersection was near, my mind seemed to blank.I tried setting the GPS, but of course it was on the fritz through this part of the city.It seemed fine while I detoured to get back on my route, then failed.Just before I did.I gave up on my outing after failing to make the correct turn a fourth time.And then I was being watched.**Intently**.Of course I knew that wasn't so.My foot grew heavier on the gas pedal anyways.It might otherwise be funny, like watching a pet mouse try to outrun its' exercise wheel.I made it home in record time.I locked the knob.I locked the deadbolt.I even secured the chain for once.I did not feel the least bit safer.I closed my eyes and tried to control my breathing.A deep breath in.A long slow exhale.A slow and deep inhale.Hold it in to keep the terror out.But it found its' way into my chest, along with an incredible pain.Before I could scream, something unseen clamped over my mouth.As if someone had suddenly used duct tape from the freezer to gag me.I couldn't move.I wanted so badly to run.But ice had crept its way into my legs, they were nearly numb.I could open my eyes though, and was met only with a blur.A mirage of air.As if I was in the desert.I tried to exhale finally but was met with resistance.**"Not yet morsel"** 

*"Mortal?Is it Death?Whatever, please just let the pain stop!"I thought to the disembodied voice in my head.*

I felt a slow draw from my lungs begin.Like it was being savored.As my lungs emptied, sheer cold emptiness replaced it.I tried to breathe in but it just seemed to escape even faster.Things were beginning to fade.I could not feel the room around me.The rhythmic tick of the clock in the hall was absent from my hearing.The stale aftertaste of gum was gone from my mouth.And my vision began to go dark.As my sight reduced to but a tunnel of muted light I caught the barest glimpse of a skeletal face and then nothingness.The creature known to this food as "Death" let the carcass fall to the floor.The last breath was always the most delectable.This one had been almost minty.It let out a satisfied belch; stretched its' tail scythe, and dissipated back into its' own realm.As it popped out of this existence it uttered a final word to itself.**"Delicious"**
