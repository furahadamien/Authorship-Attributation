Mike awoke he could just barely recall his dream.He had gone to bed dreaming that we was awake.He looked around his body, it felt new.He saw a book on nightstand, "The Man Who Lived Two Days."He wondered how the book got there and where he was.On his night stand was also a watch.He put on his watch and read his book.Mike slowly closed his eyes and drifted off into sleep.Mike shot up awake in his bed and went to grab the book on his chest, but looked to find it on his night stand on his bedside.He put on his watch and went to his bedroom window.The sky was filed with beautiful green lights.He grasped the windowsill trying to recall his dream from the other night, but couldn't.He climbed out of his bedroom window and walked to the mailbox, "Carson Bloodline" was written on the side.He walked through the front door of his house and found an ancient map on his table.Sitting down he examined the words at the top, "The Philosopher's Stone."Perplexed, he sat and contemplated what exactly this stone was.Hours past by as he drifted off into sleep.Waking up confused Mike looked over to the book on the bedside, he read the cover, "The Man Who Lived Two Days" by Michael Carson.He shot his hand out towards his mailbox and grabbed the air.He knew something and yet, was still confused.He wanted to run outside, but didn't want to waste his time.He felt a draw into the main room of his house, but didn't know why.He looked at his watch next to the book and put it on.It didn't use batteries, it was activated by motion.Without thinking he shook his wrist to get it started and looked at the quote above his door, "Promise me you'll always remember, you're Braver than you believe, Stronger than you seem, and Smarter than you think" Signed, 'Christopher Robin to Pooh.'He walked out of his door and wondered if he was alive.He glanced over into the next room at his table and saw a map sprawled out on the table.Walking through his kitchen he galned out back.The sky was illuminated with a green glow.In his yard was a series of grave stones, one after the other.Remembering the quote, he walked outside.He approached the grave nearest to him, "Here lies Michael Carson Author and Fayher" he walked to the next headstone, "Here lies Michael Carson, Adventurer and Treasure Hunter" and another, "Here lies Michael Carson, our dreamer."He spoke out loud, "Who is burying these people!"He ran underneath the large tree for shade from the sky.Engraved on the tree was a heart with the names Michael and Brittany.Below it was a message, 'Find the stone, you only have one day'.The lights of the sky began to turn a blue color.Mike sat under the tree and slowly closed his eyes.Mike's eyes slowly opened as he awoke from his dream.He repeated out loud, "I only have one day."Walking into his living room he sat down and glanced at the map on the table.He spoke, "I had time to do all of this?"He rolled up the map, and walked into his front yard with it.He looked up to the sky and spoke, "To thine own self be true."
