I try to clear my thoughts.She knows it's coming but I just need to stall her for a few minutes.She raises her pistol the second I think it.Damn."You don't want to do this, do you?", I plead.Becoming a monster after you came all this way.I know being a part of me must have been difficult but-"

"Shutup!", She interrupts.She's so close I don't even hear the gun go off, but I feel the wooden floor chip into my leg as the bullet ricochets away."I promise I won't hurt you anymore.If I knew you were real, I mean really real, I would never have hurt you!", I cry."But you will hurt her", she says, pointing to my canvas on the floor."You won't stop.You never stopped Everytime I begged you to.I saw them all.Why would my begging be different to you?"My canvas starts to wimper.I give a quick thought to plunging my knife into her so I can focus on my new found friend.The mistake was, however, giving it any thought at all.My ears still ringing from the first shot, I fail to hear the second as well.I do feel it though.The crimson spot in the middle of my chest is quite exquisite.I always took so much artistic liberty in my work I never gave thought to the simplicity of a single drop of blood, growing inversely proportional to the life it feeds upon.Goodbye old friend.I do wish we could have had more fun together, I think to myself, but not to myself as well.
