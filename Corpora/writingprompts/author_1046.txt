This familiar and now acclimatized sight/
The constant two lines by day and night/
One bright red, the other green/
Nothing ever in between

Green I did unerringly follow/
Life was plentiful, never hollow/
But often I wondered as I lay in bed/
What might have happened, had I chosen red

A successful career, a beautiful wife/
I've taken for granted all my life/
Houses, cars and credit cards of gold/
Have followed me, since I was 12 years old 

The color of earth, of mother nature/
Has made me a man of a powerful stature/
The color of anger, I've kept away/
It seemed a game too risky to play

But now I itch, to take this chance/
Gambling my wealth and my romance/
And as I sipped a decade old whisky/
My life became a little risky

From green to red I shifted one toe/
Not realizing I was my my greatest foe/
And though it seemed okay at first/
this life decision was my worst

The red was new and most unknown/
The seeds of downfall discreetly sown/
A new path to follow, to explore/
To see what it did have in store

I walked a little and then some more/
Before I discovered, I'd married a whore/
Twas the beginning of the end/
When I found my wife with my best friend

The family I thought we'd together built/
She tore it apart, without a shred of guilt/
It destroyed me and devoured my soul/
And in its place left a gaping hole

Soon I found, I was out of cash/
My dinner was what you'd leave in the thrash/
I was then lost, and thereafter forgot/
My heart a mess, my mind distraught

But the vision I had nearly a decade back/
Showed me there still was a green track/
It took me a while, to find my way/
But I did live to fight another day

Here's one step and now here's another!/
Guides me does the color of nature's mother!/
Old friends gone, new ones I did find/
Not the fancy ones, but the loyal kind

With discipline I followed the solid green line/
And soon enough life turned out fine/
I found myself a bigger house/
shortly afterward, a better spouse

Time has passed and now I'm significantly older/
My son is taller than me, and I'm afraid also bolder/
Youth he does have, with nothing to lose/
Two lines does he see, which one will he choose?
