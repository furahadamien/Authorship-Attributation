"Did you hear about the new side effects of Lazarexol?"Abe gave his friend a quizzical look.Jimmy's enthusiasm was as obdurate as it was erratic."Alright, go ahead and tell me.I have a feeling I'm going to hear about it no matter."He adjusted his glasses to look up from his book at Jimmy."Oh, I don't know what they are!'6 New Facts of Laz that will Blow your Mind\-\-' You know I could only read the headline."Jimmy sunk into his chair and patted his round belly with a thump.Abe paused for thought."I don't know why all knowledge about Laz has to be kept secret from us Agers.What if one of those side effects was hostility toward the elderly, shouldn't we know about that!"His righteous thunder left him when he realized how stupid he sounded."Of course, of course... and maybe that's exactly why we \*don't\*" Jimmy added as he leaned forward conspiratorially.Abe waved him off."Bah, you always do this Jimmy.I was just making an example, not leveling accusations!Why do you have to make everything into us vs. them, or the Illuminati, or the Circle of Lazarus!""Then why won't they tell us?"Abe gave a gruff that said to mind your own damn business and leave well enough alone before turning to leave, the mood spoiled."Excuse me sir," an Ageless woman in a red coat tapped Abe on the shoulder, "Could I trouble you for some cabbage?"Abe stared at the woman with mouth agape.She impatiently tapped her foot and nervously adjusted her purse strap.Jimmy stepped up, "You're pranking us, aren't you.Do we look like a grocery store?We're not getting involved with whatever it is you're up to, you 'Thusela.""I really need some cabbage!""Yea I heard you the first time, and I said we want no part of it."The Ageless woman started as if to cry but held back."But, but...I must!"she hurried off with firm determination in an aimless direction."Well that was... uh..."

"That must have been one of those side effects," Abe joked and Jimmy busted out laughing.Abe suddenly waved his arm in front of Jimmy in a protective gesture."Is that lettuce?"motioning toward a trail of light green leaves trailing the woman's path.She hastily groped into her purse while she walked, and cabbage leaves spilled out as she dug.She was eating it raw and by the handful in a reckless, almost frenzied way."Whatcha reading?"an Ageless man in a loose fitting suit with a silk scarf approached Abe in the brash way that young men treat the elderly.Abe replied automatically without thinking, "A Brief History of Time.""Oh cool, so it has dinosaurs and stuff in it?I could really go for a story about that!""Uh, it's not exactly that kind of book.""Nobody has what I'm looking for, I don't think I can hold on much\-\-" the man was stopped mid sentence with his mouth hanging open as if to speak but forgetting the words.He looked unusually young for an Ageless.Normally they looked mid twenties forever, but this one looked like a teenager.No wait, he looked even younger than that.How didn't they notice earlier?From a bystander, "It's true!Lazarexol doesn't just stop the aging process but it reverses it!"pointing at the young man."We must give it what it wants, we must give it what it wants!"Panicked, "Does anyone know how to climb a tree?!It\-it wants me to climb trees!""Can it make you talk to sailors?How would it even know!""So I didn't just build up the courage to go skydiving?I actually have to do it or else the Laz will kill me?"Abe looked at Jimmy dumbfounded, they packed up their things and made a hasty exit.\-\-\-

A ring of hooded monks stand around a circle chanting in ritual.When it became silent, a troubled monk stepped into the center."Brothers, I must inform you of a problem with our plan.We were going to make humanity great, but it turns out that we have no control over the suggestions that the Laz gives to people."He steadies himself and continues, "Not only does the Laz seem to be programming people to carry out their objectives at a quickening pace and without direction from The Circle, but the objectives they are given are completely random and have nothing to do with our grand plan!I fear we did not understand what we were doing with the Laz.""We tried to make humanity great, but we have failed!We did not understand, and in our arrogance..."
