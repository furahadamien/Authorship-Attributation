Yeah, thanks for the reminder that I could have had it all had I put myself first.My family loves me for the choices I made,for their future and mine.Starting at about age 30 I stopped caring what people outside my immediate family thought of me.I chose my own adventure to gradually enhance the opportunities of those starting theirs.Teaching by doing and being kind,thoughtful,all the soft skills of life.Often overlooked by the powerful and greedy short term thinkers,I was in it for the long game.
