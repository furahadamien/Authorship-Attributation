I stare at the words in the screen once more, in silent shock.Outside, snow falls for the first time on Christmas in years.Inside, my partner wanders around- for him, today is just another day.But neither of those matters.*You are loved and accepted for who you are.* If thats was true, then why did so many people find fault with it?Everything from my turquoise hair, to my weight, to the habits I have.How I see the world.Daring to be different.It felt...**wrong.** And yet... *so right.* I didnt know what to think, but I smiled- despite the tears, silently sliding down my face.*I may not know who you are, but your voice joined a growing chorus of voices, loving and deceased alike, who tell me the same* I think to myself

Long ago, such things like love and acceptance, alongside many other things, were violently stolen away.Endless mental scars mar my mind and soul.Now, I hate myself.If not for the fact I would leave people in suffering, Id have moved on to the next world long ago.Very little keeps me here... but as I think of my three lovers, my friends and family- the family I chose, not those blood relations- the tears come hard now.How could I ever hate myself?Time and time again, its been proven theres so much I offer to the world.A daring, pinkish attitude.Creativity for days.A strange, but delightful intelligence.Delightful wickedness.A charisma and beauty not defined by my looks- but, a certain aura I just give off.A kind heart, fierce loyalty, and an open ear and door.Willingness to fuck every societal belief about what women are supposed to be, and not caring.Vibrancy, fun- colours in a monotone world.Yet, many days, all I see is a collection of faults.Mental illness is nasty that way...

My roommate interrupts me, asking about breakfast.I ask him why he didnt just go without me.Because its  not worth it without RukaKat. I laugh through the tears, and shake my head.Maybe getting out will be good for me.Besides the mandatory social circuit-and hey, breakfast beats remembering all those I loved and lost.With a last sigh, I decide to submit my thoughts.If anyone ever needs a friend, I am here, always.Happy Holidays to all, from one young woman who lurks but never really posts.
