[Poem]

Here I sit, in a moss covered cell.What happened?Why was I so slow?All was lost and now all is hell.Should've heard, they were so loud.Couldn't sense, over the gnawing.Two wafers, creamy white center.Can still taste, memory still clawing.--
Was it ten?It must be longer.How many years?Wife and Kids?It was fast.Why did we squander?Every month, there it was without doubt.Our motto, as all starve, we strive.Thirty sleeves, all for us, none to give out.Was it 1?Maybe it was 2?Somehow lost, wafers went missing.Children's fault.Too kind in a harsh world.Gave something, the night came back hissing.--
Our secret, shared with the outside.Ours no more.There had to be twenty.Dressed in black.Scuttling shadows, no reason to hide.They got us, last day of our humanity.Now I'm here.Waiting for my feeding.Food?Not really.Enough to keep me living, gruel.He takes all.Sharing with none of needing.He needs me.I'm alive, in a way, however cruel.If I'm here, he will always receive.Using it, for whatever purpose, to rule?Escape?No.Freedom is a thought to deceive.Tied to him.Safe forever, why go?Maybe try?No.I've almost forgotten anyway.That sweet taste?Ah yes, sweet taste, of an oreo.
