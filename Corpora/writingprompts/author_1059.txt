It was obvious that the green line was good, and the red line bad.When it first appeared, the green line 
was going to my family or school, and the red one right into traffic.Any curiosity soon disappeared, the line
would just lead me to my death.Walking along a street was like being an invisible broken clock; one hand leading straight, the other jumping wildly back and forth as the cars flew by.At first I assumed everyone could see the line, but when I tried to tell my family about it I just got concerned looks.Not only did they not see my line, nobody else had lines of their own.Or maybe they did, but refused to talk about it.My teenage years were confused, but one thing was certain: if anyone could see any lines, they were taboo.When I started high school, I felt that my green line was broken for many months.Every free period, it would always lead to _her_, and we did not get along at all.I didnt like her, had no reason to believe she liked me, and I knew exactly where I wanted the green line to go.It didn't end well.Heartbroken and furious, the green line lighting up like an unbroken insult, I decided to see where the red line lead.It too, had stabilized.Thats when I realized how sinister the red line really was.I followed it carefully, alone, figuring it was safe as long I could see the line go on and on until it was out of sight.Eventually it lead me to a footbridge over a highway, and it became clear why the line has passed over so many stones on the way.As traffic passed, the red line would hone in on the semi-trailers, urging me to jump of the railing in just the right time to cause as much destruction and misery as possible.This footbridge seemed to be my limit of destructive capabilities.Back at school the day after, I shared a class with the girl; the green light leading to the chair next to her, the red out the door.Sitting towards the back and looking out the window I could see the red line across the school yard, finding the shortest path to the footbridge.To tell the truth, I had become dependent on the green line, and I blamed her for how miserable I was without it.I stared at the back of head, _hated_ her, and then the red and green lines joined into an intense, ugly brown color right towards her.I flinched in shock; and the lines came apart.Not long after, I caved, and of course the green line was right.For such a long time I was happy.My daughter screamed at me from her crib, and I wanted to scream right back at her.Sometimes the green line didn't lead to her, but out of the house.Fuck the green line.And then they joined again, and I cried.She's a teenager now, and I tell her that it's the choices you make when things are the hardest that matter the most."OK, dad", she says with a smile, sweet and innocent.This summer she left for college, leaving her old man prouder and sadder then she could possibly imagine.The green line has worked to my benefit the past 18 years, and I no longer have to work for a living.For the same 18 years, ever since that fateful night, the red line has pointed east.Not out the door, but straight through the wall.On a business trip to London, it shifted slowly to the south, across Europe towards Turkey.And as I've grown older, I've also grown scared, because if anyone can throw stones at cars, then surely anyone can unleash that terror that hides somewhere in Eastern Europe.This is the journal of my journey.
