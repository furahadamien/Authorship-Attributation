The sudden darkness did not seem so unusual at first.When Gabriela had gone to bed, just hours before, she had welcomed the idea of finally having a good night's sleep.Her grandkids had tired her the entire weekend the family stayed over and she had had just about enough of her son's incessant moaning about Moldova's potential place in the European Union.Christmas is simply a stressful holiday, she assured herself.It would drain anyone's energy, with all the preparations, the buying of gifts for the entire family, accommodating not only six children, but thirteen grandchildren as well.Although she loved them all dearly, New Year's Eve could not come soon enough.That way they would all return to the big city to light up the skies with firecrackers and what not.In the meantime, she felt more than glad that she was finally able to rest her fragile and tired body alongside the one person that made everything easier.Maxim.Even after so long, his face was still handsome, his eyes retaining that softness to them.After so many years of hard labor, his hands were still soft as he caressed her, handled her gently, much the same as fifty years ago when they met along the Drijestr, which became their favorite trysting place soon after.As he lifted the covers and blankets to lead her into bed, she had to laugh."Ever the gentleman, are you, sweet?""Only on Christmas, dear.It's my gift to you this year."That earned him a chuckle too.She recognized the lie immediately; Maxim loved gifting people things.He would never pass up the opportunity to make her happy.She climbed into the bed and nestled in close to her husband.With his arm draped over her waist, pulling her closer, she had never felt more safe."Remember, we're not rid of those pests just yet.Tomorrow morning is pancake time," said Maxim.She groaned at that."I know, love.This time you can do it.I'm sure they won't appreciate burned ones anyway.""I'm sure they won't, my kitchen princess.Goodnight.""Love you, Xim."She got a playful pinch in her waist from that, and a kiss on her cheek.Her drowsiness overcame her, and she went to sleep.And now, total darkness.The first thing she noticed was that she was standing up.No longer feeling the comfort of her bed, she felt around, reaching for anything yet touching nothing.This scared her deeply.Looking around, she scrambled for words."Xim?"The voice, more powerful and clearer than hers, sounded faintly across the dark.Was there another person nearby, or was that really her own voice?She did not have to wait long for the answer as in the distance a light came into view.Blinded at first, she quickly paced towards the light, slightly out of balance.As the light got closer it became more difficult for Gabriela to keep her eyes open.Suddenly, the light vanished and she stood in what appeared to be in an office with another woman.This woman was seated at a desk sprawling with what seemed like countless dossiers.On both sides of the table she could see two big monitor screens facing the woman, which emmitted a faint blue light.The woman's skin was flawless and dark brown, with a simple gold hoop through each ear and blinding teeth to complement them.She grinned at Gabriela, beckoning her closer
"Sit please, Gabriela."She was stunned by the fact that the woman seemed to know her name, when Gabriela had never seen her before.Nevertheless, she sat down in a fancy chair opposite the desk and remained silent, awaiting some sort of explanation about the peculiar place she had walked to in her sleep."I know you'll have questions.Everyone did."There was that blinding smile again.Although the woman appeared to be quite young, something told Gabriela that it was but an illusion."Let me start with my name.I'm Mona.I will be helping you get acquainted with your afterlife."The words didn't register at first.But then it came all at once, shocking her entire body.She looked up at Mona."My afterlife?What do you mean?Is this heaven?"There was that strange voice again.Mona gave her an understanding smile."This is new to you, I get it.But I promise I will help you come to grip with all of this."Mona took hold of her hand...Her hand with smooth skin, not blemished with marks of old age.Gabriela looked her entire body over as best as she could, and she saw a healthy body, leagues away from her aged one.She looked up again at Mona, this time with tears streaming down her face."How did this happen?Where is my Xim?"Mona's eyes softened at that."Maxim is sound asleep in your bedroom, Gabri, holding you as we speak," she said with a treble."I don't know how to bring this to you, other than... You've passed away, Gabriela.You had a stroke."Gabriela let go of Mona's hand, clutching at her neck as if trying to direct her breath."This is all but a dream surely, I will wake up soon and... And pancakes and..."
Mona stood up, circled the desk and enveloped Gabriela in a loving embrace.Gabriela grasped at her comforter, thankful for the support."Don't cry, child.This is not the end for you.You have arrived at the last station, and it is an infinite one."Gabriela snapped up at that."You mean, there is a heaven after all?""Not in your sense, Gabriela.We have something better.Are you ready to see it?"Mona directed her up and towards a door at the end of the office.She could hear distant cheers erupt from what seemed to be a massive crowd, chanting a name she could not quite make out.It was a truly warm sound, which filled her with a sense of peace and belonging.She stood with Mona in front of the door, with a sense of dread and unsureness.But there was also something pushing her to go through.Gabriela looked at Mona and chose to speak out."What's behind that door, sweet Mona.Is it my Xim?Or maybe little Victoria?My darling Andrei?"There was a fleeting look of sadness on Mona's face before she showed her signature grin."I know you long for them, Gabri, but they cannot go into that room.Only you can, and I assure you that you are going to have the best of times there."Gabriela looked back at the door, strengthening her resolve.She touched the door knob, feeling a warmth radiating off of the space behind it.This time, laughter erupted from the room.Before turning the knob, she took a final, quick look at Mona."Will you come with?"Mona shook her head."My place is here.As the first, I must guide anyone who comes through here.Besides, I've seen it all already."Gabriela nodded at that.She opened the door, feeling the office behind her disappear somehow.She stepped into a giant movie theater, filled to the brim with all kinds of people, cheering at the biggest movie screen she had ever seen before.Gabriela turned her gaze away from the crowd and saw a bird's view of an infant, swaddled in cloth towels in a hospital room.Her teary eyes glued to the screen, her voice added to the choir, chanting a name that just now she finally understood: "Elena,"...
