Yeah, I tried to escape a couple times.I wasn't the only one, but it never worked.For a while I thought my luck had failed me.But more and more I realized this place was the strongest fortress in the world.I had to admit I couldn't see any way out, even a lucky one.Maybe my luck was simply no match for it.So for while I just accept my fate.It wasn't bad I guess the guards weren't cruel or anything.Still, something didn't seem right.How was it that I leading the charmed life that I am would end up in the one truly inescapable, indestructible prison on earth?And on false charges no less 

And what's more more, many of the other inmates had similar stories.Was this all some cosmic joke at our expense?I finally understood when the asteroid hit.We were basically the only survivors.
