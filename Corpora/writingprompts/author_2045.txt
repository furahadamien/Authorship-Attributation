Adam, its okay I will see you soon.
Tears fill my eyes because I cant remember who it is that said that to me.I know she must be someone special because despite not being able to see her I can feel her love.Something wet touches my forehead and then I feel nothing.Hell?, I call into the void.I dont know why but something is directing me along the dark abyss.As I go further down the road I feel myself becoming me again.I was the first one to not climb the trees, me and eve planted our feet and were hairless.I am Adam, I am human.My body reforms around me, my best self, I am young again and Im the distance I can see a cave.For a while I stay in the cave by myself but I know Im alone.I wish I could be incorporeal again.I dont want to know how alone I am.Thats when I hear the call.Help me, its a female voice, it must be Eve I cant remembered voice or face but from here I can feel it.Love.I meet her but I know its not my Eve.Its a little girl crying so I bring her to my cave.She tells me she was murdered I dont know what this means.She also tells me she stood here for months alone.I realise now what l I must do.As the years go on my cave becomes larger until Utah shows me how to build a house and so we build a village called Heaven.Despite already being dead my body decays.No one knows why, so one of the people whose house is a triangle gives me a cloak and a walking stick.For they know I will not give up until I find Eve.I never could find her but I reunited families and allowed others to find their Eves.They loved me like a father which in a way I am.I never told them that I am the first human.I figure out that I have been dead for over 10,000 years.My cave is now a bustling metropolis.It is built by some of the greatest minds in human history.We made paradise.Still I kept on searching.Running faster and faster until I was just bones.I no longer remembered her name but I kept on looking and found her in every person I led to paradise.One day I met someone, a man who told me stories he made, of human spiders and iron men.So I asked him to join Artist Street where everyone from Bowie to Beethoven now lived.With his mind and body restored he along with the other artists made their best work.Heaven now stretched as far as it could and all at once 7 billion people arrived outside the gates.After this people stopped arriving.They said the world had melted in fire and fury.Mankind has finally ended itself.My children had destroyed themselves and for the first since I found Emile, I had no purpose.I sat down and slept.All around me were the friends I saved.The families I had made whole and the artists and their adorers.I was so tired.I gave up.And all at one they melted into one voice.Adam its okay we will see you soon.

I wake up and all around me is darkness I have no form and I dont know who I am.In the distance I see a cave.
