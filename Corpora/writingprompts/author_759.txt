Ahhhh... another beautiful sunny morning in the woods.Trees to pee on, sticks to gnaw, bushes to pee on, more sticks to gnaw, another tree to p.... oh I guess I don't have to go.I better get a drink at the river.*sniff sniff* What's this?Smells like poo.Tastes like poo!Continue to the river, so thirsty.That water is so nice and cold!Let's SPLASH!What's that?A fish!Wanna play, fish, wanna play?First I'll splash, then you.Ha-ha!Great fun!Bye fish!Okay, now what should I do?I should dry off in the dirt!Aaahhhh YA!That's the stuff.Other side now, slide, slide, slide.Whoa!What was that?A RABBIT!?!?Come back rabbit!Chase, chase, chase!Whoooooaaa, you're a fast one!Wow!What a jump!Wait, where'd you go?There!No there!He-ey!Come back!Oh well, at least there's still this pine cone.*chew chomp* Ugh.. this doesn't taste so good but I'm not gonna stop now.Whew!What a busy morning.What was I doing yesterday?Oh ya, looking for friends.Where was I going?This way?That way?Hmm... *sniff sniff* there's something new coming from that way.I like that scent!And so the nameless dog continued following the scent, being distracted only by more trees to pee on, sticks to chew, and the draw of a warm beam of sun to nap in.These were his loneliest days but also some of his happiest days as they lead to his new friends.No, his new family.He finally found the origin of the scent: humans.Humans who took in the dog, let him sleep in their home, fed him, and forgave him for those times he got a little too rambunctious and chewed a shoe or several.The dog left as suddenly as he had came.And although the humans were saddened, they knew he was once again bounding through the sunlit forest he came from.Chasing rabbits, splashing with fishes and eating... well, whatever he could find.He was also waiting.Waiting in the warm beams of the golden sun for his human family.Waiting to share his forest and all the adventures within.EDIT: RIP, I'm sorry for your loss.
