\[Poem because I had to\]

&#x200B;

Jack, be nimble

Jack, be quick

Jack drove over another, ick.&#x200B;

Jack, be bold

Jack, be told

There can be only one, as of old

&#x200B;

Jack, be plumber

Jack, be soldier

Jack make sure you grow older

&#x200B;

Jack be smart

Jack be wise

Jack got all of the other guys

&#x200B;

Jack went down

Jack went up

Jack found God and the Devil, gulp

&#x200B;

Jack meet Jack

Jack meet Jack

Now you know, you won't go back

&#x200B;

Jack must fight

Jack use blades

For there can only be one Jack of All Trades
