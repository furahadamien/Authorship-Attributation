You sit, hunched over in the darkness.Paralyzing fear, and the horrible realization that you are trapped for an eternity on your throne which once was a place of comfort sets over you.You close your eyes and a tear slowly drips down your anguished face.You reflect on all thoes good times which built the trust you once held for the palace now betraying you.In retrospect, it seems there were so many signs, so many opportunities you could have taken to try and avoid this.Even so, deep down you know it would have only prolonged the inevitable.This endless torment that you must face alone.It almost seems funny now, how easily you could be saved from this torment if you had anyone close to you left, but they're not here now.You can't deny that being your fault though, so you decide to stop plauging yourself with what has happened, and instead devote yourself again to the situation at hand.Minutes pass as you try in vain to think a way out of your entrapment, but as minutes pass to what seems like hours you just draw blanks.Your resolve to free yourself slowly dissolves to self pity, and quickly you find yourself sobbing, tears now flowing freely, and you seemingly resign yourself to your fate.You can think of only one way out, the poket knife you carry on your person religiously.You tell yourself you can end this all quickly, one sharp flash of pain and then it's all over.You pull the knife out of your poket and open it.You place it over your left wrist, trying to work up the courage to action your final act.Finally, you move to end it all, but just before you do, you hear a faint, scattering sound, where you expected silence.You shake yourself, knowing it mist be your imagination.Back to the task at hand.You bring the knife back up, this time with stronger resolve.Once again, as you try to cease this pain you hear the same sound, this time louder.You put down the knife, somewhat intrigued at what this sound is.It grows to a constant scuttling that makes your skin crawl.It grows, seemingly coming from an adjacent hallway.As it continues to a dim roar intruige turns to fear, and you start to question whether something else hasn't come to add to your torment.Faster and faster this thing tears down your hallway and terror and suspense mingled in your heart and you let out a squeak.Just as it you expect it to slam through the door, displaying the horror that has been building in  you mind it stops.Everything falls silent and all of a sudden you can hear your heart pounding, your heavy breath betraying your location to whatever is behind that door.Slowly, the door starts to creaks open and you need to stifle a scream.In the darkness you can't make out what dark figure lies behind it, before it starts to make it's advance.As it does you realize it isn't one figure, but rather thousands put together to become one, and you start sobbing again.This time not of despair or grief, but of relief.They came for you.You had never truly expected them to aid you, even in a time as dire as this, but they had.They approached in unison, and as they did the one object that could save you emerged from the swarm.It looked like a white amulet as they brought it forward.Hesitantly you reached for it, fearful that it might be snached away at the last moment as some cruel joke.As you grasped it felt more real than anything, the soft feel of it filling you with warmth, and for the first time, hope.With two hands now, you turned to your side and inserted it into it's pedestal.Upon completion the army of small creatures immediately retreated, hustling away.As they left, you could almost pick out a small echo: " our debt is repayed", and silently you nod your head.After the sound of their departure fades to nothing and you are alone, your focus returns to the object brought to you.A smile spreads over your face as you unravel the object and carefully fold it on your leg.Then, with the utmost care, you wipe you ass, stand up, and flush the toilet.That is most definitely the last time you forget to check for toilet paper when your roommates aren't home.
