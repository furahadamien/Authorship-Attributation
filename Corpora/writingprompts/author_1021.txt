Hell came for us faster than we could run.Sometimes when I look back on those days I wonder how we thought we could make it last.Im alone now for the first time in my life.The dog Id found immediately after The Reckoning, small, pitiful, slightly deformed from the hazardous radiation it had been subjected to in the womb, has been dead for a few months.Even when she was a puppy she was a fighter, bright eyed and sprightly with one slightly clubbed foot that didnt stop her from meeting or exceeding my pace when we were running, and we were always running.In what little of my imagination I have left I always believed that she would stay with me, young and happy forever, while what was left of the world crumbled around us.10 years was more than I could have asked for, but it gets so quiet now.When you live in a world that uses electricity for every convenience, even the quiet tends to feel loud.Theres always an air conditioner running, someone blowing leaves, television left just loud enough to intrude your thoughts.After the first surge I learned what quiet was.That one was small, temporary, but the two weeks we were without power felt like their own lifetime.I chuckle bitterly to myself when I think about how spoiled and soft I was then.Even when you were by yourself it was hard to feel alone.Now the silence roars around me sucking my thoughts away faster than I can have them.I keep the same house I had Before.The realtor wasnt just trying to drive the sale when she told me that the bones were solid and that this house would last through an earthquake.There wasnt an earthquake, but even as other houses in the neighborhood disintegrate around me my old girl stands tall and proud.They havent had the benefit of my fastidious home maintenance, but its more comforting to think that shes magical, that somehow this shell of gypsum and wood are actively protecting me.Shes not, but its a nice thought.I dont keep the same calendar, or any calendar, though, and the days start to bleed and blend together without change.Wake up, forage, repair, and eat what never feels like enough, sleep, repeat.This day starts like all the others.I take a deep breath on my porch.Its not sunny anymore.Whatever they did to take the power offline had some effects on the weather, and while I can see the disc burning brightly behind the heavy gray clouds its never quite warm.Im light on chores today, finding myself in a sweet spot between a meager harvest from my homemade green room and putting up the winter boards so I dont freeze to death in the coming months.In a moment of whimsy and despite the fact that everything around me is already turning brown under the threat of winter I decide to venture out to see what I can forage, maybe a bit of lichen or some moss.Im surprisingly light on my feet, feeling buoyed by the idea of a leisurely day with the thought of finding something, anything green growing in the wild supporting me more than my bones.The whimsy continues after I pick up my knife and basket and wander down my maintained walk.Better check the mailbox. I say, giggling to myself.No one has sent mail for more than a decade, nearly two now, but my fingers grasp the pull and tug regardless.When I open the box I experience a moment of pure cognitive dissonance.Its filled to the brim with small white boxes with a blue logo.I glance quickly and slam it shut, now laughing and shaking my head.Theres nothing in the mailbox, I have enormous tumor eating through the delicate folds of my gray matter.I open the box again, expecting that the true contents will be revealed, but the boxes are still there, defiantly white and tempting.I cant quite relay how I feel as my trembling hand pulls out the first box.There are no postmarks, but there is a date written in a fresh hand that dictates that the year is 2041.As I mentioned earlier Ive long since stopped caring about calendars or days but this makes me frown and start to count.How many equinoxes have there been?How many cold winter days that felt even more endless than the others?I pull the boxes out faster now, dropping them eagerly into my basket.Each one is dated in that same neat hand, one each for the last 18 years.I remembered getting these for a time when I was a child, then for a time longer as an adult, as a result of a contest I had won as a freckle faced youth.With my bag heavy and my mind racing, all thoughts of foraging for the day discarded, I make my way back up the walk and head to my darkened bedroom.I light the hurricane lamp, an early pillage from a sporting goods store 10 miles away that has been with me nearly from the start of this nightmare and get to work.Starting with the oldest box first, the one dated 2023, the year of the final surge, I carefully open each one, my jaw dropping just a little wider every time.Every single box was filled with Oreo cookies.A small pack of 6, but more cookies than I had seen in the last 20 years.My heart pounded as I carefully peeled the little bag open, the scent of chocolate hitting me instantly.My mouth waters.More accurately, I drool.I give the first cookie a tentative lick.I dont immediately recoil, so I take a bite.Thanks to the lack of air or light in the mailbox, they were remarkably crisp and fresh-tasting.I finish the first cookie, and then another.Before I realize whats happening Ive finished the first bag, my head spinning with the sugar rush.Im giddy, laughing hysterically, and high, high, high the way only refined sugar makes you.I then vomit spectacularly, filling my bedroom with a scent thats acrid and bitter, but still chocolatey.I immediately crash from the excess.This is more calories than Ive had in a single day in years.Anything rich or fatty I had usually went to the dog to keep her healthy and chubby, and now Im paying for my impulse and greed.It takes me being sedentary for a moment, my mind wandering in a sugared daze for me to realize how highly unusual this is.Did I eat cookies with an unknown provenance?I sure did.How did they get there?I understand why I might not have been aware of their presence.I havent had any need to check the mailbox in years.No need to check for an electric bill.But it did raise other questions.Was there still an Oreo factory somewhere?Is the year 2041?Who was delivering these packages?I couldnt remember the last time I had seen another person.There was more wildlife, the occasional feral dog, but nothing that could open a mailbox or tuck treats inside.Where were they coming from?In my mind I was already hatching the plan.I reasoned with myself that it was unlikely the deliveries had been made during the daytime.I was always awake and working, either fixing my house or gardening in the greenhouse.I would have heard a truck.I would have noticed the smell of exhaust on the wind.The dog would have barked for the ten years she was with me.So, the cookie deliveries were happening at night.I dragged myself upright and went outside, my feet directed not by my head but my heart.Without bothering to get the hammer to carefully pry the nails out, I rip the board I use to insulate the window against the winter chill right off.Inwardly, my mind is spinning.I dont know when the last delivery was made.I could be 364 or 4 days away from seeing it, but I would see it.When the world went to shit and everyone died around me I assumed I would meet a similar fate.Now with an empty cookie packet in my pocket and a stack of white boxes nested on my nightstand, I know better.

It's my 80th birthday today.&#x200B;

I wake up early as I usually do, my bladder urgently signaling my brain that the dam is going to burst.After a blind stumble (what used to be a confident strut, mind you) to the bathroom and a piss, the robe comes on and I make my way downstairs to my waiting wife.&#x200B;

She's already dressed.She wears less makeup now than she did when she was 30, and is lovelier for it.She aged better than me as a result of vigorous diet and exercise, something I could never quite get behind.She smiles at me like she doesn't see the stubborn sack of fat that settled between my hips in my early 40's, and I'm grateful for it."What would you like to do today?"she asks, hopping more nimbly than I could dream to from her wooden stool.My hand moves to my throat- a reflexive response to being put on the spot.I act as if I have an itch and scratch into a few days' worth of stubble."Ah..." I say, hesitant.The truth is at this age birthdays are a reminder that you are speeding toward death.Time moves faster.My body decays more rapidly.Even as I stand here, now affectionately rubbing my wife's back, there's dull pain in most of my joints.I want to stay home and have a quiet dinner with her and put on a television program.I know that my wife would consider this selfish and is constantly on my case to make myself more available to our children and grandchildren.My lips purse while I'm getting my raisin bran and she can't see."What about a little family dinner at Katie's place?"I say, referring to our second child's home.Bea, my wife, smiles, and for a moment I forget my aching body."That sounds wonderful," she says, and I know that she's been planning it all along.In moments she's kissing me on the cheek, gathering her things, and is out the door with a "Call if you need anything, I'm going to help her set up!"&#x200B;

 There's nothing left to do but chuckle, shake my head, and eat my breakfast.With a few moments of peace I have time to get some chores done I've been putting off for a while.I fix a door latch.Replace the filter on the kitchen sink.Trim the dog's nails.When you're young you don't think of the maintenance required for your dreams.In your mind you see a picket fence that always stays white, a wife that always stays happy, dogs that stay happy and young.You are quickly disabused of these notions.Eventually you are trapped by your dreams, and wonder if they were worthy goals all along."Did I really want three children?"you ask yourself, thinking perhaps of the daughter you can't talk to or the son that sneers when he sees you.I wonder to myself, even now, if this is the life I really wanted.The bitterness has increased exponentially over the last couple of decades.&#x200B;

Eventually I get dressed for dinner and make my way to my daughter's house.My firstborn had always been a loner.Even now he lives in a big city far from our rural outcropping in an apartment alone.Whatever clever doodad I have now sometimes shows me a picture of him, usually alone, usually a drink in his hand, staring peacefully out over some ocean.My daughter, however, immediately wanted a family.She barely made it through college before she found The One, and married him six months after graduation.She wasted no time at all getting pregnant, but by the time the second child came along we could tell that while she had grand ambitions for supporting them, she might need a little help.Our third daughter, having gone to school and then immediately into a graduate program, was out of the picture and unlikely to move back home, so we switched homes with our daughter, son in law, and their children.We took their modest condo and they took the sprawling Victorian I had inherited from my parents.The self-driving car ambled slowly along the drive, but every meter we passed made me more tense in my seat.Car after car lined the drive.Some I recognized, family and close friends, but even more I could only hazard a guess at.&#x200B;

Shaken, I was deposited on the wraparound porch, my heart pounding rapidly.Acting more bravely than I felt, I flung the front door open and was greeted by the whooping and well wishing of every colleague, friend, family member, and associate I had made in my life.Eventually my eyes found my wife, still a stone-cold knockout in a floor-length black dress.I offered a playful scowl and she laughed, the sound filling the large foyer and dining area the party was being held in.Despite the deep introversion I have maintaned over my life, I still managed to accumulate a lot of people whom I can spend a pleasurable evening mingling with.The wine flowed, the appetizers served were all my favorites, I was a little perplexed not to see a cake, especially considering it was my birthday.&#x200B;

All wonderful parties eventually achieve a natural "lull" in conversation and enchantment.The trick is to end them here before everyone becomes tired and impatient.The evening reached that point without candles or an embarrassing song, and I was grateful.Sensing the lull, my daughter appeared as if by magic and shot me a sly smile."Everyone, thank you for coming.This has been a wonderful party for a wonderful man.We've had the luck of 80 years of getting to know him, here's hoping for 80 more!"she cheered, leading a toast with champagne handed to her by a deft waiter."If everyone could join me in the kitchen I have time for one last surprise."she said, grinning like a fool now.She ushered us all into the kitchen, a tight squeeze despite the generous space, and eventually I made my way to the center of the gasps and "awwws."I clutched my throat, stunned, mentally the years and decades melting away.On a small white table, one familiar to me as my own hands, was a cake and a photograph.The photograph was me, 70 years earlier, a cake identical to the one sitting on this very same table was visible.I swallowed hard, the memories of that party hitting me like an icy wave.My friends were there... My mama...I had begged for... god damn it, what was the gift?I wrack my brain as I take a seat at the table, the very same square foot I had occupied on the same day 70 years ago... "Where did you find this table?"I asked, trying to act normal while my mind was spinning.My daughter doesn't hear me, there's a flurry of activity, the song we all know, laughing, clapping, an artificial smile plastered on my face.The second I let my mind focus briefly on the song I remember.I remember the gift I had begged for...It was a new thing.Better virtual reality.You were supposed to be able to hardly feel them and the graphics were supposed to be hyper realistic.I start to laugh.Hysterical, manic laughter.I'm crying now, too, crying because I know the choice I have to make.Do I leave them?Do I get another chance?Everyone starts to look at me, and I start to scream.My gnarled, aged, fingers move up, how could I not have noticed this before now... how long have I been ignoring this pressure on my eyes and temples?I rip the glasses off and throw them across the room where they shatter on impact on the same sturdy wooden counter top that had just been obstructed by a room full of people.I look down at my hands, finding them fleshy pink and small, then up at the kitchen now empty, save for my mother and father.
