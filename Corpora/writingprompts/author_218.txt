We all remember the moment we were in before the great blinding.One minute we were in our kitchens.The next... Well god knows what happened next.I,  personally, was in german class reciting verbs.And than it happened.I blinked.And nothing.I started to panic.What happened!Where did my eyesight go!I called out into the cold air of the classroom and an aura of fear washed over me as one of my closest friends spoke up."I cant see."He said
The rest of the class followed in scattered replies.Ranging from screaming to quit murmurs of agreement.and than IT happened.We called it the crashing.Every car,  plane, boat, train, and vehicle you could think of crashed.At least a few dozen into our school.The casualties were massive.At least 4 billion people had died.Mostly in the great crashing.Millions more from mass suicide.But us humans found some ways to prevail as we always do.We adapted and gained new senses.And we lost our old one completely.We have no recolection of colour at this point.Until now.I was heading to a supermarket for some noodles.I was in japan as an exchange student at the time and couldnt leave.So i was stuck there for etirnity.I walked in to the automated chime of a robot welcoming me in.And than just as i had it takrn away.I got it back.And oh boy did i get it back.When it happened my whole entire vision was one sentance.Dont tell them you can see.Plastered on the walls,  the floor,  the labels.All in perfect font.I looked around me for an awnser to why thid happened.And than i saw IT.A robot.Everywhere i went.Everything was a robot.The people,  the dogs, the cows.Robots everywhere.I stopped to pick it up.What could be happening.Why was i here in a society built off of robots?Where is everyone?And than i got grabbed on my shoulder and was pushed down into a sewer.I looked at my surroundings.It was a mechanical maze of wires and tubes everywhere.And underneath my feet.A hatch.I took a moment to look at myself.I was what?23 years old now?My hair was long and messy.My feet were dirty.My hands were caked in some kind of substance.I remembered taking quit good care of myself even while the blinding was happening.Why was i filthy?I shook myslelf awake and put my thoughts together.Was it a dream?If so why was it so long and vivid?No that doesnt make sense.I put that aside and opened the hatch.I looked down into the dark abyss below me and jumped.And what i saw at the bottom was terrifying.A sea of dead bodys.That all looked like me.All of them.And they all had a different number tattooed in red ink on their necks.
