"Thursday evening, it was a Thursday evening sometime in December, five years ago."My reply seems so empty for such a question, it was so much more than just a day, it was rebirth, it was epiphany, it was an unbelievable discovery.Feelings of hatred, joy, curiosity, worry, fear, wonder, but most of all, a feeling of purpose."Mr.Gaines?"The journalist rousing me from my stupor."Call me Simon, please, not so much formality."I can't stand formality, I leave the organization and order for my machines.On top of it all, I despise people calling me Mr. Gaines.Reminds me of my old job, of my old boss, and of my father.Two men that couldn't have died a moment sooner than they did."Simon then, what was the process of realization?How did you come to remember your past before the erasure?What exactly happened?"She stares so intently across the table."Funnily enough, it was a newspaper article, an op-ed interview piece like yours."I still remember every tiny detail as though they had been burned into my eyes permanently."I walked into my apartment, the door was ajar, no surprise there, the landlord was always breaking in, though I had no proof, he always dropped hints about how he was making extra money, like he was incapable of completely hiding his crimes.The man always used to say things like 'shame that Simon Gaines' property was taken by a petty thief',  so much emphasis on my name, like it was supposed to mean something, and after that evening, I realized it did."The journalist looks at me quizzically for a moment

"What does that have to do with the question exactly?Other than the part about the door being ajar."I chuckle lightly in response."Nothing all, I'm just being tangential and overly dramatic" She sighs heavily after looking off past me out the window."You do have a flair for the dramatic, Mr. Gai- I mean Simon" she seems to think she has to appeal to my ego or some such similar pleasantry.How many times do I need to tell her not to be formal or over polite?"All that aside, back to answering the question.The door was only slightly ajar, I figured my little 9 volt trap had scared the idiot off, I'd started putting them on my door after the break-ins got bad, nothing but slight painful shocks, couldn't understand my affinity for constructing them at the time.Regardless, I came in and sat down at the table.The room was ungodly cold.I decided to start a fire.First though, I wanted a cigar.Hadn't been able to get decent ones in months, so I tapped the last vanilla Prime Time out of its package, put it in the corner of my mouth, and threw the package into the fireplace.I picked up the news print on the way over to the start the fire along with the firewood.""So finding the article was complete chance, a fluke?"The journalist was thoroughly surprised.guess the rebirth of a super villain is something that you'd think happens by pure luck."Absolutely" She looked even more stunned.Maybe she thought I was joking?"I only paused because it was a Tech article, two years old maybe It was on the dangers of AI and advanced machines, and  I had a fascination with robotics and electronics that I couldn't understand, I barely caught the title before it went into the fireplace"."You have got to be kidding me" her eyes full of shock

"Not even slightly.""Continue please, I'm intrigued."no longer was she tired looking and leaning back in her chair with disinterest, but sitting on the edge of the chair wide eyed, with pencil and notepad at the ready."The article was a fear monger's work, spinning worry and malcontent towards machines.It included an interview with a police detective and a man they called Blank, they made him out to be some sort of hero, said he had just stopped the 'evil machine mastermind himself, known as Circuit, who's programs and robots had done everything from murder, to commit credit and identity fraud.'underneath his quote was a picture.""And the picture was you?"The journalist could barely contain herself."Yes, but my hair was shorter in the picture, and my now scarred face was instead adorned with wires and my eyes were covered by goggles, and the mangled hand, missing several fingers, that was holding the article, instead was adorned with chrome artificial digits in the photo.As I read the photo caption 'Pictured above is Simon Gaines, commonly known as Circuit, standing in front of a pile of his destroyed machines, after his memory has been erased by Blank' my now lit Prime Time fell from my lip.I was only drawn out of my awe trance by the smell of the carpet burning, and i stamped out the cigar.""What did you do immediately after that?"the journalist clamoring for more.

"I wrote my girlfriend a loving note, apologizing for leaving, telling her it wasn't her fault, and that I wasn't who I said I was, that she shouldn't try to find me for her sake.Then I left for the nearest hardware store and electronics boutique."The retelling of the tale bringing me fairly close to tears, thinking about the paradoxical mix of confusion and certainty that came with my realization."Everything came back to you?All the previous knowledge?"the journalist had nearly stood from excitement at this point."Everything, instantaneously" the words slipping effortlessly from my mouth, as though nothing else could have been said.The journalist leaned back in her chair after finishing her notes."Well Simon, this has been a wonderful interview, and these last thirty minutes have been particularly interesting, but it is rather late, and I should get going, I would like to return tomorrow to learn more if you don't mind?"She said as she stood and put on her coat.

"Of course, that sounds fine, its good to get this all out for once.I look forward to seeing you again tomorrow Ms. Sykes"

"Please, if you insist on a lack of formality, call me Paula" and with that, she left me hear at my table, wondering what the hell I should do till I fall asleep, waiting impatiently to continue my story again.ceaselessly tapping my new chrome fingers against the large granite counter top."Dammit, never going to sleep now.Huxley!Make me a gin and tonic!"and the servant droid got right to work.
