As I felt the jolt of energy from the main engine activation shake my body to the core, I knew my timing would have to be pitch perfect.Of all the wily villains I had dealt with before, only Elon has pushed me to such a brink as this, that coy and devilish bastard.I was already stripped of my equipment, to be left almost helpless as I slowly die of asphyxiation as the world cheers unknowingly.At least the view would be nice.*Almost* being the key word.For once, the equipment wasn't on me,  but Elon's."I hope to god this works Q", I say to myself.As the hidden worm Justine planted in Elon's Roadster worked, my hidden shackles unlocked, and the main cameras turned off just for a bit.I knew it wouldn't last, as even Q's masterpieces couldn't go against Musk's secret AI.*-SpaceX HQ-*

"Um...Elon, sir, we've got a problem."The look of glee in Elon suddenly evened out ever so slightly.A suspicious tone cast upon his face."What's the issue?"he replied in a low growl."W-we've lost camera link with the car, and no updated non-visual monitors can be found."To an outside observer, an almost eerie calm decended over the room, but to Elon's most trusted henchmen, they knew it was Elon's way of showing tension."*Bond.* You sly dog..."

"TESLA, I need you to take care of that worm *now!* "

When the cameras came back on seconds later, they found an empty drivers seat.*-James Bond-*

I was safely out of the car at least, the decieving 'DON'T PANIC' still lit up in mockery.All I need to do now is get to that main booster before it's too far away."Easier said than done.", I muttered to myself.The leap was a tense moment, especially considering the absolute silence of even the rocket behind me.I had to land this.Thankfully, I took a bit of crash-course physics of outside atmospheric conditions earlier.The predicted jump lined up perfectly, with me facing the side not to be lit up in flames from the soon-reentry.I seriously hope the heat plating hokds up for this.*-SpaceX HQ-*

"You might've escaped the glorious death James, but you're still up for a wash."

"TESLA, redirect the main booster 30 meters off starboard and maintain speed, as well as turn off cameras when the booster gets close.This needs to look like an accident."', s   ss'

"Hope you like swimming in a weighted suit Bond.You'll explore the other frontier instead..."

My grip on this thing was already slipping, AND the course is being sent into the drink?Today is not my lucky day for certain.However, it takes more than a little water to kill this cat, Elon.I can already see the experimental aeroplane being flown in from a distance.Heh, it looks weird seeing it from so far above."Leap...NOW!"I leapt away from the rocket with as much force as I could, and braced for impact as much as possible.This will break at least a few bones.As my vision blacked out, I could hear jet approaching fast.Hopefully, they won't be too...late...
