1.At that time, Jesus brought his apostles to him, for he had rolled a joint.It was known among the followers of Jesus that his father was the best among all growers, so it was with great haste that the apostles gathered round him.2.Once all had taken their places, Jesus held his joint aloft, for all to see."Fetch me a light," he declared; and it was done.3.Jesus did take the first drag, christening the joint with his christly lips."Into this doobie I have rolled the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit."He then did pass to the right.4.The apostle Peter did accept and toke of this blessed joint, passing it on to his brother Andrew, who passed it on to James.From James it passed to John, and from John to Phillip.Phillip passed it to Bartholomew, who passed it to the apostle Chad.5.It was now that the hazy silence was broken.Chad did toke of the Holy Spirit, though his face revealed his confusion.6.And he did ask Jesus, "J, how can that be?How can we be smoking the Son, when you are sitting right in front of me, bro?"7.Chad did pass the joint to the apostle Brad, who carried on; "Ya bro, like, there is no way you could ever fit inside of a joint.I mean, you're a grown man.And especially after all that P90X we've been repping.You're looking swol, JC, am I right, boys?"8.The other apostles let out a WHOOP WHOOP; Brad did indeed receive an amen.9.All, that is, except for Judas Iscariot, seated to the left of Jesus.He rubbed his own brow with thumb and forefinger for a moment, before glaring at the apostles Brad and Chad.10."You fools!"He declared, "The Holy Spirit is not him physically!He is a man, made holy by his spirit, which comes from the Lord, his father!"11.Chad was taken aback."So my spirit comes from my father?"Brad did question further, "Maybe that's why your mom always says you haven't got any!"12.The apostle Brad did expose his knuckles to the apostle Thomas, and the knuckles of the hands of the two apostles did touch.13.Brad the  turned to Jesus, "JC, sick doobie, bro, but it's running a bit.Just let me-" 14.Judas did cut him off."Pass the goddamn joint already!The Lord is your father!Your spirit comes from him!"15.Brad, now, was taken aback."The Lord is not my father, bro!Ephithius is my father.Ephithius Johnson.I look just like him and everything.And besides, my mom ain't like that, bro."16.It was now that the apostle Chad appeared to have received a revelation from the Lord."So, like, if my spirit is holy then can I roll and smoke myself, too?J, you're gonna have to show me how to do that, bro!That is some next level shit!"17.Brad did struggle with demons."Maybe she is like that.I mean, I don't know.I mean, she did leave the house at night a lot.And Ephithius was never really around until I was like 13."18.It was at this time that the joint did reach Judas; it was but little more than a roach.Judas did throw up his hands and exclaimed, "Jesus Christ!Well, that's just great!"He did stand, and like a departing storm he did depart from the room.19.Bartholemew did call after him, "Judas, thou art a cunt!"at which Judas did raise his middle finger, not looking back.20."J, bro, totally not your fault.That was super uncool of Judas.You rolled an awesome J, J, bro," the apostle Chad did console.Brad helped, "Ya, bro.Wicked J. Stellar performance bro."
