A waking life.This is how we roll.A matter of 24 hours, translated into 7 lifetimes.Time flies, space stands still, while in our heads, we move through spaces and time stands still.A paradox, really?No.I'd say it's our tendancy to avoid reality because that's what we despise most.So now,
You must sleep.
