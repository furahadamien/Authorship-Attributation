My eyes open.I don't want it to.I don't want to see what awaits me outside.But as I cross my fingers, hoping I'd come out alive, my hopes come true.I wake, back in my lab, as I look around.Everything is still the same.The same papers, the same machines, the same research.I sighed in relief.Not today, I guess.To die when I was that close to figuring out our lives would be devastating.The world needed my data, and I was so close to finishing it.I just had to avoid dying...somehow.I went back to the microscope, as I examined his brain one last time.I only had one chance at this, a chance selflessly granted to me by my old lab assistant.She was as devoted to the project as I was, and when I was worried over the lack of humans I could test on, she...I wiped the tears fron my cheek.No.I had to stay strong and determined.This was humanity's last hope, the only way our lives could ever stay real.The household names everyone knew didn't change anything, except the collective universe we all dreamed in.In reality...only our day of birth can change anything.There could be endless amounts of creatures that haunted the real world and secrets yet unlearned.But we would never learn them, and ever come into contact with them, until our dreams became reality.Until the universe we'd imagined became a universe we made.And all I needed was the finish the extraction and learn how to modify the brain.I just needed the last piece, the part of the mind that made our vivid dreams.I was that close.But I seemed to have misplaced it.My old assistant's body lay on the bench, as I ran one last test through her.But I could not find that piece of the mind anywhere!I was sure that it was there when I ended work the day before.Had my mind constructed a dream somehow without it?I had no way of checking.But I couldn't find the final piece of the puzzle I so badly required.Frantically, I clawed about my lab, desperately trying to find what I needed.It couldn't end like this!She would have died in vain!But as the day ended, my efforts were indeed wasted.Fear built up within me as I approached my bed, the same fear I had for the past 2 years, since the project begun.*What if I died now?*

I awoke.But I couldn't see the lab before me.I looked around, but that day passed.Another day passed.Instantly, I realized what this meant.I was dying.I couldn't do anything, as I was locked in position, forced to relive my last moments.In order, from the start of my life, I witnessed the happiness of my life, prior to my project's beginning.A deep feeling of nostalgia choked me, as well as regret.It was too soon... too soon had my time run out.Especially when I was so close...I watched the album of my life flip through before me, as I saw my assistant once again, her body limp on the floor.It was horrible to see my life's degeneration, a fact I'd never felt throughout my research.But as the grand finale came, my final few memories passing, I saw distinctly something I'd remembered.The part of the brain.It was at the side of the room, in a small jar.I saw myself, the night before my death, passing by the jar in my frenzied search.All the time...It'd been there, waiting...

And with a heart burdened with guilt, regret and remorse, I woke up for the final time.

4 digits.For a moment, my degree in mathematics failed me, as I struggled to count the numbers before me.Un, Deux, Trois, Quatre.There was no mistake, though the existence of such a person...frightened me.My vision had always been right, as evidenced by the guilty looks on the minors' faces when I turned them out of the bar.I'd never had to kick someone out for being overage.But 5746 years was a lot of time, far before Anno Domini 1.Was he immortal?A god?Or some old guy with a superpower?I didn't know, and I definitely didn't trust the 'Age: 30' that his ID proclaimed.Maybe my powers had faltered this time.Maybe...

From behind, I saw another man slowly approach me, his IDs in his hands.But as he made eye contact with me, his eyes widened in fear.I saw him whisper into the 4-digit-old man, with visible shock on both faces.That was when I saw the age of the newcomer.5746.I tried my best to suppress my shock, though I failed miserably.1 was surprising enough, but 2?2 men that had lived for the exact same time from so long ago?I was about to demand an explanation, but one of them beat me to it."Why are you 5746 years old?"he questioned, fear in his eyes.I opened my own wide.Could he read ages too?And was I...that old?No.That couldn't be right.I remembered my childhood, the photographic proof of my birh just 28 years ago.But they didn't seem to be lying, and the mention of that 4-digit number again was chilling.What kind of sick joke was my powers pulling?Or were they the ones pulling my leg?"We've found another suspect, boss," one said into a walkie-talkie.The other drew a gun from his pocket, training the muzzle on my forehead."What are you doing?You're-" I tried to explain, but he cut me off."No more words, time traveller.We've waited long enough to catch you and your gang," he replied, smirking as a group of policemen appeared from the darkness.I felt the cool metal slide around my wrists, as I was forced towards the car."Move!"one of them shouted.That voice...I seemed to recall.The cold handcuffs.The interrogation.Disjointed images flashes before my eyes, as they slowly became clearer, culminating in...I knew now.But...why were they doing this?Was it a plot to throw of the police?"James!"I shrieked, to the man I'd once been partners in crime with.He chuckled, though I could tell it wasn't just for effect.I saw the twinkle in his eyes, the signature twinkle he gave when he condemned a foe to death.My other pal Aldrich stood by, his eyes conveying his helplessness.James' face wasn't one of friendliness anymore.It was one of animosity and hatred."Good riddance," I saw him mouth, as I was shoved into the car.As we drove off, I could still see him, as he advanced slowly towards Aldrich.I closed my eyes in cowardice, though I knew what would happen.What I had feared when I agreed to sacrifice my memories...it had all occured.There was no way back.Even inside the driving car, I could hear the terrified screams.The circle of betrayal had been completed.

Green for go, red for stop.The rules applied as always, and as a normal, non-colour blind individual, I followed the soothing colour of nature as it led me to prosperity.The green line directed me away from the train station when there was an anarchist bombing.The green line led me to the office where I would eventually be employed at.The green line even told me when people were coming to foil my plans of burglary, during my period of poverty.But I'd always paid so much attention to my saviour that the other, more striking line never surprised me as it did now.Always, the bright red directly contradicted the light green, leading to an obvious conclusion.The red line must be a curse!The green line was the authentic life-saver.But now...now it was different.If the red line was always wrong and the green line was always right...then *why were the two leading to the same place?* I looked forward, then at my feet, where the contrasting colours mixed to form a near-straight line.Undoubtedly, they ended at the same place.But the red line always signified the wrong choice!Screw it, I thought.I'd lived in comfort for decades since I'd discovered my power.The small mistake I might commit wouldn't mean anything.I stormed right in, and the lights within temporarily blinded me.But my eyes instantly focused on someone in the room.Someone I knew."Don't do it!"I shouted, staring at the gun in my friend's hand.If I'd been a second later...I shuddered.But his expression stood steadfast in defiance as the weapon was pointed at his skull."I've nothing left to live for.Not even you," he spat, the words breaking my very heart though I knew he didn't mean it.I grabbed the pistol, where the green line and the red line led to.In an instant, it clattered to the floor, as my friend fixed a steely gaze on me."I'm not worth saving," he said, his eyes beginning to tear."Even my school of choice doesn't want me.I'd tried twice, but I was too worthless to enter.What for do I live?"I was stunned, his words robbing mine out of my mouth.It was true.What did he have to live for beside art?Then it hit me."Hitler, live for your country!It technically isn't your birth country, but you love it all the same.Protect it with your life," I advised, sayig whatever I could to diffuse the volatile explosive before me.His gaze drooped, and his eyes looked wistfully on."For Germany..." he whispered, his voice crackling with excitement and patriotism.Screaming his country's name, he rushed out of the house, his gun left behind.The green and red lines still pointed towards the life I'd saved.Adolf was always my best friend, and his life was as much to him as it was to me.I smiled, though I still didn't understand one thing.Why was the red line there?Edit: Fixed a couple of plot holes!Thanks to /u/glylittleduckling and /u/CarlHenderson
