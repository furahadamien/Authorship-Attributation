I try to do it differently each time; short with long hair, tall with a buzz-cut, black, white, Asian, Pacific Islander, optimism, nihilism.Not in any particular order, but never randomly either; I know what she likes.I've had a long time to figure her out- years and years.When I first arrived in this city, a lonesome, weary traveller, I only hoped to find a home or, at the very least, some semblance of one.The thought of companionship hadn't crossed my mind in ages.When you have lived for as long as I have, after all the trials and failures I've  endured, it was difficult to maintain motivation.I was jaded and I was painfully aware of it.I had fallen into thinking that that would be my eternal, repetitious existence- but when my feet touched the concrete and my lungs took in the smog and my eyes rested upon this city, I found something so paradoxically complex and simple it intrigues me to this day- 
I found humanity and everything changed.Humans are not completely different from the other bastions of civilization I have come across, but they hold a sort of social depth that I had never encountered before.My curiosity was immediately ravenous and seemingly overnight I joined in to the bustling cityscape; Routines, rituals; I made friends and my friends introduced me to coffee.Coffee!What a glorious, glorious thing!Coffee... that's how I met her.After years of assimilating and joyous investigation of humanity I finally felt as though I was home.The centuries of wandering were over for me; I had found everything I was looking for- or so I thought.Then the day came when I decided to go to a new coffee shop.It was right around the corner the whole time since I arrived and I had never been!It's strange how things like that work out, but there I was, standing in line, trying to decide if I would try something new or go with a classic.She was behind the register.I was so preoccupied by what I was going to get I didn't even see her at first."May I have a white chocolate, raspberry mocha with six shots of espresso, please?", I asked when I stepped up to the counter, my gaze locked on the overhead menu searching for something I might flip-flop to."Wow, that's what I call a pick-me-up," she said through a chuckle."Yeah," my eyes falling to meet hers; one green, one blue- fascinating, "I- I really like coffee."She pushed a streak of blue hair behind her ear joining it with the rest of the ocean on her head, 
"Who doesn't!?", She said, beaming a smile that I felt with every nerve ending."That will be..."

I was snared.Everyday after that I returned to that shop every chance I could.There was this inexplicable feeling I had that drove me to learn as much as I could about this anomaly- this woman.She must have been intrigued with me as well because after weeks of interactions at the shop, when I felt there was more to know- things that a patron could not ask from a clerk- I asked if she wanted to spend time together outside- anywhere doing anything- and she agreed!Walks through the park turned into lunches, lunches turned into dinners; before long, we were spending every day together.What started as research turned into bliss.I had long since buried any feeling such as that and feeling it again made me forget the inevitable truth: all things end.One day, her hair colored changed; what was a calm ocean turned into a volcano of red and orange.The smile I had felt ripple through my body diminished, and then came the note:

"I'm sorry.Goodbye."I have lost so many times.So many times I've picked up and moved- started over; a new town, a new country, new planet, new galaxy.This was a new situation.I wasn't going to give up- not yet.That's when I decided to change form.I had kept the same appearance the whole time I was in that city- I did it for her, but she didn't want that form.So I changed.Whole new me; whole new chance.I found her again, and again, and again- each new me found her and each new me lost her.It's been countless years since I wandered into that coffee shop and I've tried countless versions of myself trying to hold on to this anomalous woman, but to no avail.In the past I would have moved on, but something keeps me in pursuit.Time has never been an issue for a being such as myself, but for her it's not so kind.Each time I change, I align my appearance to match her age, but I know it won't last forever.As long as we can share time, the pursuit is worth it.
