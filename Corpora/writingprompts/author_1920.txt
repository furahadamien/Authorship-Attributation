Something was off about the afterlife, for one thing the sign above the gate read Aww shucks., a phrase he was certain had not been in any religious text.Ever.But hed never been one for sitting around and waiting for things to come to him, so he patted down his clothes, he recognised the ill fitting suit, it was the only one he owned after all.Patting down his pockets he was a bit miffed to find out that all they had given him to take to the afterlife was two dollars in small change, a lighter and some lint.Grumbling he pressed on, through the gates of heck and into lands not often seen by the eyes of man.The small road ran through a landscape that could not exactly be called Menacing or even Vaguely threatening, it could at best be described as maliciously uninteresting.The small hills did not have any torture pits, but then again, the skies werent filled with clouds and cherubs.For a moment he wondered if he was in purgatory, but the place was obviously made with a purpose, it had brick paths leading through the landscape and here and there something that could have been a torture device, although what sort of sin warranted the use of something called a Mechanical stern-talker-to, whatever that was supposed to mean.He had been examining it when the creature walked up to him.It looked like what youd imagine a demon to look like, if you thought that demons were short balding men wearing a knitted jumper that happened to have red skin and two bumps on the forehead that could only be called horns by the most generous of narrators.The demon greeted the man and extended a hand Howd you end up here then?I thought they stopped shipping them down here now that the big mans decided to let everyone in to the penthouse. The man looked incredulously at the proffered hand, and the demon attached to it.Where the fuck am I? The demon recoiled slightly, pulling back his hand and taking a step back, Oh my, thats going to cost you it said, pulling out a small jar.The man managed to look even more incredulous, which was hard, as the appearance of a demon wearing plaid had set the bar quite high.Do you take dollars? he managed to ask, taking the change from his pockets, 50 cents american. the demon said as he dropped a few coins into the jar.So, where am i then? The demon gave an embarrassed smile, Im afraid youve gone to heck Hell you mean?, The jar came up again, No, not hell, a small copper coin with a square hole was dropped into the jar, Heck is like the other palace, but its not for the real bad people, or was i suppose.You see, when  youre evil and you commit a couple deadly sins they sent you to the other place, which is all fire and brimstone and lots of poking with pitchforks. As they talked they had begun walking along the road, And of course if you were a good guy all around, you get to go the penthouse.But if you were, so to say, a bit of a dick. Another coin, You got sent to heck, were you were mildly tortured and had to atone for committing any of the 7 forgivable sins. They neared another gate, this one was slightly more menacing that the first one, but still not anything that could be called threatening.It read Impatience The man had to concede that patience had not been one of his virtues in life, hed cut in line once or twice, maybe pushed an old lady once.Okay, twice.So he strode into the first circle of Heck, once through the gate he found himself not in the plains that had been visible through the gate, but in a waiting room of average size, a large digital counter hung over a door, with a box next to it that appeared to have some paper hanging out it.The plaque above it read Please take a number and wait to be called. And so he did.Time passed, the number on the board ticked down, one by one.The time between seemed to vary, but in the end it reached the number on the ticket, the PA came on to call his number  and the doors lock clicked.He got up, opened it and walked into the office, where he was greeted once more by the demon.It handed him a small paper, on it written in delicate, neat handwriting it proclaimed I, [your name here], have been awarded one (1) forgiveness for the sin of impatience. He took it and turned to leave, only to find himself once more between the gently curving landscape of Heck, another gate loomed above him, it read Foul language and improper behaviour in good company.
This too, was a just judgement, and a sin he had committed often enough.He stepped through the gate and the scenery was changed again.This time it was some sort of workshop, on the table a large cardboard box was set, inside were wooden planks, screws and the instructions on how to built a Frlatelse cabinet.He sat down and got to work.This was of course easier said than done, for starters there were at once too many screws and not enough of them.The allen keys seemed to slip out at every possible opportunity and the instructions changed every time he looked away from them for so much as a second.The cabinet came together slowly, but surely.He screwed in the phillips head screws with his flathead screwdriver because it was somehow the only one that fit, he sorted the screws by size despite their apparent insistentence to get wider, shorter or even disappear entirely when he tried to put them in.Eventually through gritted teeth he managed to put the cabinet together, it looked quite sturdy, and he felt a slight twinge of pride for enduring the nightmare that had been the assembly of this friggin cabinet.As he put down his screwdriver it promptly collapsed.The words were already in his mouth, mere seconds away from being sent out into this world, before he caught himself.His jaw slammed shut, his lungs expanded as the words were sucked back inside and he held his breath for a few moments.The workshop faded into the familiar landscape of Heck once more.The next four circles of heck people who wear mixed fabrics, petty theft, eating the last slice of pizza and general lack of politeness had of course been challenges, but hed faced them down and come out a better person for it.Now he stood before the last gate, the seventh circle of heck, last challenge before hed be allowed into the penthouse.This gate was even less ominous than the ones that had preceded it.But he had survived six challenges, which were not that hard to begin with, so without so much as reading its name, he strode into the seventh circle/

Behind him, the gate labeled overconfidence swung shut.
