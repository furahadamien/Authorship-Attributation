They said it was a miracle that I survived.A miracle, everyone kept saying.As if it might make me feel better about losing my arm.It didn't.The guy in the semi, who'd been drinking and fallen asleep, had veered into oncoming traffic and hit my Rav-4 sending it rolling into the creek next to the highway.At least that's what they told me.Truth is, I couldn't remember anything from the day it happened.In fact, I couldn't remember the past week.Along with the concussion, I had a broken pelvis, fractured femur, three broken ribs, and a ruptured spleen.I was lucky to be alive.A miracle.I found out after I left the hospital that the driver of the semi had died not long after the accident."Succumbed to his injuries", they said.I was angry.He took my arm from me and I felt I was fairly justified to hold that against him.It wasn't until I started having the dreams that I started to feel differently.Dream, singular, is more accurate because its always the same dream.I have both arms again and I'm standing in a hallway.Behind me I can hear people having a good time, the sounds of a party.But I can't go back that way, I have something I have to do.In front of me is a door.A sign on the door says: Staff Only.I try the knob, but its locked.Then I try to open it with my left, the one lost in the crash, and it opens easily.Then I'm in an underground train station.There are people everywhere.A train comes and people rush onto it.It's not my train.I don't know why I know that, but I do.It pulls away, off to its destination.I look around to see there are a few people still on the platform, each muttering to themselves and pacing back and forth.I recognize the semi driver as one of them and I walk up to him.I want to confront him.He's in a terrible state.Blood is running down his face from an open wound on his forehead, but he pays it no attention.He just keeps muttering to himself.I can't tell what he's saying, though, its incomprehensible.I try to get his attention but he can't seem to hear me.And then I wake up.I had the dream every night for weeks.Then one night, finding myself in the dream once again, I decided that I had had enough.I was going to get the semi driver's attention.I was going to make him see, make him feel my anger.So when I found myself in the train station again, I walked right up to the semi driver.I gave him a piece of my mind.I screamed and yelled and let it all out.Nothing.He just kept muttering to himself like I wasn't even there.I snapped.That was it, the last straw.I swung a punch with my left, phantom arm, at him with all the anger and hate that I had in me.I really let it all go.Every ounce of me went into that punch.The blow struck him clean in the chin.He stumbled back, surprised, and looked around wildly like he just woke up from a deep sleep and didn't know where he was.Then he looked me straight in the eye, a sudden look of understanding coming over him.Bewildered by this turn of events, I just stood there staring at him.He looked down at my phantom arm and frowned.Then he turned and boarded the train with the others.I watched as he took a seat inside the train and looked out the window at me.We watched each other as the train started pulling away from the station.He waved and I waved back.But when I looked closer at him I saw that it wasn't his hand he was waving with.He was holding a severed arm up and waving it back and forth.My arm.
