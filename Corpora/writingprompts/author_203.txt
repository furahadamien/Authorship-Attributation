As everything came into focus, red block letters greeted me

DON'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE

For a moment I sat, looking at the shapes.Like the others, I had been blinded December before last.My MX-Sarah assistant had guided me back home while the world was in chaos.The robot became my eyes.I needed an upgrade but Patriot Pay was stalled.We were the lucky ones.The ones with skill sets that didn't need our eyes.United States Occupational Relief picked us up.There was an uprising, if you can call it that.Blind masses screamed in the street for something to be done.Screamed for answers.For a cure.But the doctors had been blinded too.The e-security cleaned everything up very quickly.It was rumored they retrained you in the camps for an occupation you could do without your sight.I liked to believe it.The more plausible rumors aren't vey nice.Official broadcasting never made mention of the camps.They were something not to be acknowledged.Like the blocks of empty houses.Something to be forgotten.DON'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE

After two years, letters become shapes before words.When the message finally hit, I closed my eyes reflexively.My heart started racing.I had a new secret to keep.*Marcus, is everything all right?*

MX-Sarah's grating, chipper tone stabbed the air.I rubbed my eyes and replied "I think it must be a bit dusty, that's all".I opened my eyes and willed them out of focus.*You would like me to dust.Is that correct?*

A sickening wave self-consciousness hit."Yes.Sarah.Schedule dusting today.1500."*Dusting scheduled today at 3pm.To cancel, say CANCEL*

Then there was silence.I was trying to remember what I did with my body.My eyes.Be normal.Be normal.DON'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE

Note:  Have to go now.If someone is interested in finishing this, I'm thinking over-population for post global warming scarce resources caused a global oligarchy to take dramatic action.Artificial intelligence has made human workers all but unnecessary.Mass blinding was a way to exterminate a large portion of the population.Mass disinformation campaigns / desire to keep people in their place.Hence, DON'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE

Thinking there is are "The Visionaries" that paint the letters, subverting the rulers.I'm imagining secret transport network + a final boss scene, ambushing the ruling class.The blindness is caused by an issued chemical.Just need to avoid exposure.Some accidentally are "cured" because they have accidentally avoided the blindness dose for long enough.Thanks for the great prompt OP!
