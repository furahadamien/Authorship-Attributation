In a dark and damp basement sits a man bent over a black and grey device set in the middle of a watch strap.He laughs softly and murmurs to himself as he makes a few adjustments with a custom hand tool.Nodding firmly, he closes the front cover and snaps the contraption  on his wrist.On the front face of what looks to be a watch body sits a tiny chronometer showing the current date and time, a second chronometer beneath shows the wearer's coordinates, and a long pressible thin bar sits beneath that.Carefully, he pushes the recessed button on the left of the watch face and holds it down.The chronometer begins to count down, first slowly and then speeding up.The man grins as the device shows a date in the year 1000 BCE.Once satisfied, he removes his hand from the side of the device and raises a finger."Ok," he murmurs silently, "Let's do this."He presses the middle bar.----

April 5th, 1000 BCE.The night winds blow over softly undulating grasses.Beneath the bows of a tree a woman and her brother sleep.They have traveled long and far looking for the special medicinal herbs required by the tribe's healer and were on the way back with a bundle of dried flowers carefully nestled between them protectively.In her dreams Aiyana sensed movement.She rolled away from the warmth of the shelter and moved stealthy into the forest around it, her head cocked to the side listening.Across the clearing she heard a voice cry out, "Motherfu...!"The electrical discharge hit her square in the chest launching her back thirty feet through the forest, knocking her out cold.Her brother found her the next morning bruised but alive.----

Alan Schumer opened his eyes.He brought his hands up to rub them through his hair and felt the weight of the device on his wrist.He sat up, back stiff in surprise and then delight.3/25/2016, 13:01 said the chronometer.He looked around his apartment, eyes wide.On the ground in front of his couch sat a pine cone.He raised his eyes to the ceiling and screamed, "Yes!"Not only was time travel possible but he, Alan Schumer, had done it.Twice!He scrambled to his feet and ran into the bathroom.Then he stopped, took a few steps back into the hallway, turned right and then took the first left and headed down the steps into his basement."Discharge... " He murmured as he took the last few steps into his work room."What was that about?"He'd just picked up the specialized tool when the doorbell rang.He cursed silently before heading up the stairs toward the front door.The bell rang again."Just a minute!"his voice trailed off as he opened the door.In front of him, eyes hopeful but serious stood a young woman of obvious American Indian descent."Can I help you?"She smiled and looked into Alan's eyes."Hello Alan.""Do...  Do I know you?"She smiled wider, "I go by Anna and you can say we've known each other for a very long time."He stepped back, confusion evident in his eyes."Do you mind if I come in?I think," she looked at his face and at a black ash streak on his wrist, "you have questions I can answer."----

"Kitchen," she spoke the word while strolling into his home.He followed her.She moved unerringly through the living space toward the hallway leading back to his kitchen and dining area.As she entered she opened the cupboard over the top of the stove and grabbed the tea pot, moving aside the glass and plastic cups in the process.She bent down and grabbed the old container of tea bags from beneath the sink, pulled the handle on the third drawer on her right and grabbed a spoon without looking.Then she opened the cupboard near the entrance and grabbed an old bag of loose leaf tea.Only after she had the kettle on did she glance his way.She smiled again, delight dancing in her eyes,  "I am VERY familiar with your home."He sat at the small dining room table, rubbing his hands together slowly, 
"Tell me everything."----

As she talked he was struck by her level of confidence.The way her eyes played on his, the easy comfort and the way she took up space in his home, it felt like she knew him intimately.She spoke about growing up with her parents, her siblings, her cousins.She spoke about hunting animals in the forest and searching out medicinal plants for the health of her tribe."Then," she picked the tea cup up and took a sip, "on one trip home, you arrived, and my life changed forever.""I only took one trip.... " he looked at the device on his wrist, saw the still evident ash outline.His eyes sought hers out, confused.She set the cup down and looked off into the living room as her face scrunched up in heavy thought."Travel through time causes the build up of excess chronitons that were released into the closest living creature roughly paralleling your physical and mental structure."She looked into his eyes."In one of our conversations you called it a 'chroniton flux.'"He looked at his hands."So time travel is possible but how do you ground chronitons?"He sighed.She grabbed his hands in hers and looked deeply into his eyes."You really should test it."The device beeped and she withdrew with a little wave, "see you in a few years!"He vanished.----

Alan sat in a toilet stall in a Paris train station.He stood, flushed, and stepped out of the stall toward the sink.Warily he looked at the device."Ok," he breathed, "no weirdness...?"The chronometer listed the date as September 12, 2056.He stepped out of the bathroom and looked across the room.Throngs of Parisians rushed through the terminal."Alan!"She was there waiving at him from behind a group of travelers."Anne...How...?"She grabbed his arm and walked him to a small two seat table in a corner far away from other ears."I'm always here."He stared at her, comprehension dawning."I don't need to worry about a ground, because that's what you are."She nodded."And," she added, "I know when you're traveling and where you're going to be and can meet you.""How are you still alive?"His voice trailed off."You once told that your device needed another part to be whole, so it made one.As long as you keep traveling and you keep the device functioning, I'll be around to greet you."She smiled and clasped both his hands in hers."It's not so bad..." 

She kissed him
