The Great Machine of Time spun differently for Zed than it did for others, he felt as he stepped in through the metal doors of his cell.When the bars shut with the signature loud clunk he flinched and the tear he had stayed off for so long finally fell.People have different reactions to how their life unravels.Some are used to it, some, like him, really aren't.It was never supposed to unravel.The Great Machine should've rewarded him now as it had done so many times before.He never expected anyone above 50 to end up in this condition.His old habits faded from his mind after the first month.His first word after incarceration finally came."No."A simple response to a simple question in the meal section that he had become too familiar with.Today like many others, he shared a table with a couple of people.Unlike the other days, today he had a conversation."Where ya from?"asked the man who called himself "Giz"."Jadot," he answered, "Fourth City, seventh sector."The other man at the table joined in at this point, "Yes, a Fourth man, clearly," he said, "I'm from the ninth myself".Zed's expression betrayed the surprise he felt upon hearing this.People from the Fourth City, especially the those sectors were highly civilized, well-to-do people."Not exactly the kind of riff-raff you were expecting, eh?"asked the man from the ninth."No sir, everyone here's from nice places.You'll hardly find anyone below a Number of 98, really.The Great Machine works in mysterious ways, as they say."The old cliche really struck a nerve with Zed."That never helps.That doesn't help the lessers and that doesn't help us now, even if we are all 100.Not once, have I ever faced any opposition worth mentioning.Then one day, they pick me up for some complex crime I don't even understand and I'm eating brown paste, staring at a grey wall for the rest of my life.The Machine...I feel...betrayed."After a pause, Zed continued."Our world does not work like this.The Great Machine decides the fate for everyone.I'm not supposed to be here, because if the number doesn't work, then reality itself wouldn't exist, right?""That's the idea, yes.But I've heard lessers say that nobody understands the Machine, not really anyway.Everyone here will tell you their idea of how it *really* works.They're all theories really, including what Kingdome model.Mine's about balance.Us being here upsets a great balance of the Numbers.It's out of equilibrium.That's why, eventually, everyone gets freed.Everyone I've seen, gets freed at some point.Some take longer but it always happens.""So what you're saying," asked Zed, "is that there's a discrepancy and our Numbers should still work as they did, and we'll just be set free because of it?""Exactly."responded both the other men.The conversation when he went back to his cell had given him calm.A peace he hadn't felt for a very long time.He slept the most comfortable sleep he'd had in years because of it.Eventually his time came.He was to be set free.After completing all the many formalities, gathering his belongings, there was one final thing he had to do.He had to verify his identity and reclaim his wealth in Room 33.Tired though he was, he entered it with enthusiasm.There he saw it.A great furnace, so deep, it seemed bottomless right under him.A guard followed him and motioned him to step over the edge of the floor and into this great fire below him.When he hesitated, the guard pulled out his tazer baton and pointed it towards Zed.However he didn't need to, because a great force of wind, that only he could feel pulled him towards the furnace.In his final moments, he understood."Balance."The Numbers had to be in equilibrium.His was too high, so was everyone else who was incarcerated.This is how the Great Machine kept the Numbers for everyone in balance.He was to die, so that others may continue.His final breath, though agonizing, was one of gratitude.
