"So what, you gonna monolog about your motive and stuff?"Ring-Lord smiled bitterly at me, while I pointed his own sword at his chest."To take out the hero wannabes like you."I told him simply as I pushed his sword into his chest.They called him Frodo, the guy who could turn invisible.Running around the city, taking out bank robbers and other supervillains, normal superhero stuff.The civilians would call him a hero.But I wouldn't.I knew his true face.He did all that not to actually save lives, or to preserve justice in this world.He did it for fame, for the praise he would receive whenever he went out to public.I'd seen people like him on my travels from my home planet to earth, and yes, I despised them.I heard clapping from behind me as I stepped back from Ring-Lord's lifeless body.I turned around to find Ray, your average clich Italian mob leader."Wow.Thanks.I've been trying to kill that guy for years."He said to me.I shot him a glare, and his clothes caught fire instantly.He ran away screaming.He wouldn't survive for long, I knew.I never liked that guy.His ego was bigger than even the baobab trees growing back on my home planet.Working with the idiots they call "supervillains" would surely be the last thing I do during my time on this planet.I've seen real heroes, and real villains as well.Those two were nothing.I've killed five of the strongest "heroes" by now.The civilians loved them, I didn't.Brainlock.Sociopath.Sadist.I remembered snapping his neck in his own telepathic dimension.His ability to attack my mind was strong, but he overestimated it.He'd rather watch a man burn to death than save him.And I despised him.Mach.Thief.Pickpocket.I pumelled her with a single punch, such that her own speed killed her.She was fast, running faster than bullets and all.I'd seen her power, and I understood that she was too fast for the naked human eye to see.Pity she abused this power, running about in shops and commiting petty theft.The police couldn't stop her, but I could.Athena.Gambling addict.I don't care how good she was at calculating her chances of success in a roulette spin, she was gambling away the money that could've been used to send her daughter to school.Also, since she was such a genius, inventing telekinesis gauntlets and jetpack boots, when I smashed her with that van she really should've seen it coming.Boulder.Videogame addict.He could grow some sort of rock-symbiote inside him to become Boulder, a big, rocky... beast that tore through steel like paper and tossed around cars like tennis balls.But when I ripped him out from his rock-body, he was a simple, ordinary human being too addicted to online games to go out there, get a job and earn some money to send his daughter to school.I could imagine Athena and Boulder's relationship to be much more pleasant before I came to this planet.They probably used to be a loving couple back then, not the pair one could here screaming at each other in the bedroom from miles away at night.I'd seen couples like them before.I truly felt sorry for Stacy, their 8-year-old daughter.For now she'd stay at an orphanage.Who knows.Maybe I'd raise her to be my apprentice someday.And now Ring-lord."Phantom" I muttered under my breath.Alcoholic.She'd keep going to the same bar every night, get drunk, and wait for her husband to come and pick her up.I pity that man, partially because he had to let most of his salary go to his wife's drinking habits.Phantom was still alive, but I'd corner her someday and use her phasing-through-objects ability against herself somehow.Maybe after her death, he husband would pick up whatever he had and come at me, trying to avenge his drunkard of a wife.I wouldn't fight him, actually.He was Splintershaft, and he was unlike the other "heroes".He was noble.He fought not for fame or money, but to preserve justice in this mess of a world.I'd sit down and have a nice little talk with him someday.A true man of honor, he was.Of course, even with his enhanced reaction speed, machine guns, shotgun, titanium sword and martial arts, he wouldn't stand a chance against me.But I wouldn't try to kill him.And Hades.God knows who that guy is.They said he could actually beat me, so I'm interested to see who this person might be, and why he didn't step in when I first became a threat to this world.But that was enough hero-hunting for now.About time I took out some of the egoistic supervillains on this planet.Because I despised them as much as those heroes.I walked over to Ray's burning body, and thought about my next move.After some thought I swung my red scarf around my neck, and moved on.I'd go for Cowboy next.
