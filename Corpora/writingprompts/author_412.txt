**PART 1**

Another day watching these doors, another day wasted as far as I'm concerned.No one  under 30 would be caught dead in this dive, let alone anyone underage.Most people here are regulars who drink mourning their own lives.I only have to make myself useful a few times a year.Either when the occasional brawl breaks out, or when some young stuffy out'a-towners think they'll be able to grab a quick drink under our noses just cuz' we're in the sticks.My job is nothing more than a formality and everyone knows it.No one seems to mind though, hell neither do I anymore.I'm just waiting now....waiting to die.Many years ago I was fresh out of high school, living in a one bedroom apartment with my girlfriend Jenine.God was she beautiful.Fortunately the apartment situation was only temporary, we had big plans for the future!I worked part time at one of those "guess your age booths" at the local amusement park and I had a reputation for never being wrong.People would come back with masks and bags over their head and I would still guess their ages correctly, to their great perplexity.Although I suppose the word "guess" really isn't an accurate term here.In a way, I've really been cheating these people out of their tickets.Ever since I was about eight years old I've been able to immediately tell the exact age of anyone that I make eye contact with.Their age appears above their head for a split second in gray cloudy digits.It's a bit hard to notice unless I'm looking for it.I've told my mother about my ability and she told me my father had the same eyes.No matter how much I pry though, I could never get much more out of her about my father.I've considered telling Jenine, but I'd hate to scare her away.I like to think of it as my own little super power, although apart from scamming kids out of tickets it doesn't seem to be too useful.Jenine was an aspiring cook who eventually wanted to open her own restaurant.It may sound dumb to you, but you'd think differently if you had a bowl of her stir fry.I don't believe I've ever tasted anything half as good.Unfortunately for her, part time work at the amusement park and baby sitting money just wasn't enough to afford any sort of property.Jenine was ,for lack of a better word, much cooler than I was and managed to get me a higher paying job at a local club as a bouncer.I've always been on the larger side, Jenine's cooking didn't help , so it made sense to some degree.After my first day I realized just how perfect of a job this was for me.Half of my job is to look out for fake IDs, which takes no effort since I can see people's ages right above their heads.The other half of my job is to look big, which doesn't take much effort either.I found it humorous that Jenine found the perfect job for me without even knowing about my secret!In my excitement I damn near told her about it, but quelled myself.On my second day of training everything was going well.I was pretending to inspect someone's ID knowing full well they were far too young to enter.I was staring off into the distance when a middle aged man caught my gaze.It was only for a second, but I swear the number above his head read "2400".I thought nothing of it and continued with my job, for about 2 seconds until the bewilderment hit me.My jaw dropped and so did the fake ID I was pretending to look at.2400?That can't be right.I scanned the sidewalk again for the man, but could only see his back now, his age had already disappeared.The stuffy kid in front of me asks if he can go in yet, though I just barely heard him.I begin walking towards the man, leaving my post in the process.I hear the line of people behind me become louder and unruly.That's nothing more than background noise to me right now.I'm fixated on the man in front of me.He's quite far ahead of me and on the other side of the road, had I left even a few seconds later I doubt I would have ever seen him again.I pick up my pace, fast walking as sweat begins to glimmer from my brow.As I gain on this mysterious man the doubt begins to set in.What am I doing?This is ridiculous, how am I even going to explain this to my boss or god forbid Jenine?I begin coming up with theories in my head about what I saw.Maybe he's 24 and was standing next to someone who was... 00?No, there certainly weren't any babies walking down the sidewalk at night.Maybe there was a decimal I didn't notice and he's 24?Although I've never seen anything but whole numbers my entire life.The man turns down an alley way.No more time for doubt, do I dare follow him?With a cliche gulp and a wipe of my brow I decide I must know for sure what I saw, or I may never be quite sane again.I enter the black alley way.I cannot see particularly well, but I can make out a silhouette rummaging through garbage.His back turned towards me unfortunately."Uhm, excuse me."I barely manage to say


The man jumps backwards in freight and shouts "What!What is it?What do you want?"I hadn't thought of that, what the hell do I want?"Uhh, do you have the time?"I muster.The man looks at his watch and says " Just hit the stroke of midnight.Is that all?"With this statement the man finally meets my gaze.I'm almost too nervous to look, but I know I must.Above his head in those familiar cloudy digits, 2-4-0-0.Two thousand four hundred!!I'm both excited and scared beyond belief."Well.. if that's it, then I will be on my way."He says sternly as he begins to walk away.I stand there frozen, staring at this man who is supposed to be over a millennia in age.He doesn't look a day over 30.Maybe he has some unique gift like I do?What should I say to him?Before I can think of something to say I feel a powerful arm wrap across my neck and lift me on my tip toes."Hey Bro, you can't just leave your post like that!Get your ass back there CHOP CHOP!"Says the man behind me.I immediately recognize the voice as the head bouncer, Eddie, and push him off of me.I look back into the alley way and I can no longer see any sign of the mysterious man."What are you doing out here anyways weirdo?"He questions pretentiously.I tell him I'm not feeling well and really need to head home for the night.Obviously he was a little more than upset with me, but after dealing with his protest I finagled my way out of my shift for the night.Once Eddie leaves I quickly walked down the rest of the alley way in pursuit of the mysterious millennia man.I egress the alley way and enter the middle of a street.It's dark on both sides and there is no sign of anyone.With no leads I have no choice but to give up pursuit.Heading back to the apartment where I live with Jenine.I begin to worry about the storm of questions I'll be verbally assaulted with upon my early arrival home.Although these feelings quickly fade to gray.There's something about seeing the supernatural right before your eyes that puts everything into a larger perspective.I ponder silently as I walk the gloomy road home.The asphalt wet with dew emits a somehow nostalgic smell.My senses have been piqued since the encounter.I wish my dad was still around, maybe he could explain what I saw.
