"This is it."Eve said tearfully."Go, you'll see I'm telling the truth."Her lover had just finished testing her Personal Replacement Device which now worked.They weren't always lovers,  when Eve had found Elle she was looking for someone to help her with what she called her "Ongoing problem".From the moment she could remember herself, she knew she wouldn't die.When she was younger, this excited Eve.When she heard about Elle and her development of the PRD, she saught her out, looking for someone who could help her out in the future.Elle of course, didn't believe her.When they first met, she thought Eve crazy.Soon though, they fell in love, and it didn't matter anymore.As their relationship evolved, as did the PRD, and so came the day it was ready.Elle had already travelled her own timeline- up to 70 years in the future- allowing for growing life expectancy.Now was time to go to the unknown."If you do live forever Eve, then go to these coordinates in one hundred years time."Elle said, rechecking the calculations and sliding Eve her notebook.Elle looked down and a tear ran down her cheek."What if you don't come back?"She whispered, barely heard above the slight whirring and whining of the PRD."Oh do stop worrying Eve!I always come back to you!"Her voice softened."I truly love you my dear.I won't live without you."Elle reached down to Eve who was sitting in the worn office chair and kissed her, before stepping back and activating the device."Let's see if you are right about your immortality!"With that she glitched out of sight."Maybe you won't live without me, my love" Eve said mournfully to the empty air where Elle had previously been."But I'm probably going to have to live without you."
