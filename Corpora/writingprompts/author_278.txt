Emily sat across from him at a table draped with a red satin tablecloth.Her champagne flute remained untouched as she searched for the words to say.Im sorry Jacob, but, she paused averting her gaze.Its not you its me. 

What do you mean? 

I dont think Im ready for a long term relationship.Its just too much right now.Youre great, truly.But I think its best if we take a break.

For how long? he asked, sadness crept into his voice.She sighed quietly.Ill let you know.Im sorry, she said rising from the table leaving him alone, head hanging.He watched her go, her heels clicking against the black and white tiled floor of the Italian restaurant.*Well, this version didnt work either.Maybe she really wasnt ready for a long term relationship,* he wondered.*Or.Maybe she doesnt realize just how much she needs me.* He dropped a stack of money on the table and slipped into the night.Heavy rain drops began to fall as he made his way toward Emilys apartment.Emily tossed herself down onto her couch and pulled her plush robe around herself.She clutched the warm cup of tea between her hands and drank deeply.*This is what I want,* she smiled.A quiet scratching turned her head.*Probably the storm.* She turned the TV to listen to the home decorator explain their choices for the house they had just flipped.The scratching came again, more urgently this time.She set her tea down, her bare feet whispered across the floor as she made her way to the front door.She had to stand on her toes to see through the small peephole.Im just hearing things, she tried to convince herself.Another series of frantic scratching turned her head toward the window.She grabbed an umbrella and gripped it like a baseball bat.Lightning flashed outside her apartment, the brilliant light briefly illuminating a small shape on her fire escape.*Is that?*

A quiet meow came from the window as a reply to her question.You poor thing! she cooed as she opened the window and lifted the soaking wet kitten inside.The cat meowed happily and pressed its head against her plush robe.Emily dried him off and got a small dish of tuna fish for the cat.It didnt have a collar or anything that could help her identify who the cat could possibly belong to.Well, I need to call you something.Any ideas?

*Jacob,* the cat thought to himself and meowed again.How about Hamlet?

Jacob meowed again.*Doesnt matter to me as long as you love me.*

Odin leaned forward in his gilded throne, his single eye judging the young man who stood before him."What do you make of this, mortal?"Odin asked looking to his left and right, down the line of gods.Thor scoffed, "This pathetic creature is no warrior!Look at his frail limbs and tiny body.How many frost giants have you slain?""Uh, none," the young man stammered out."How many of your foes have you deceived in order to turn the tide of war?"Loki asked behind steepled fingers."I don't really like lying," the young man answered."And what of that weapon in your hand?How many lives has that taken?How many trophies have you carved from the bodies of the fallen?""Well it doesn't really do any of that.""Does it have any mystical properties?Perhaps it returns when you throw it?"Thor asked caressing his hammer.The young man shook his head no."Then why are you here?What can you possibly do to earn your place here among the greatest heroes of all time?"The young man thought for a moment and hefted the metal spatula."It does have a power.Something that very few things can possess," he paused and met the eyes of the gods sitting in front of him."It has the power to slay hunger!"he roared and thrust the spatula into the air.Odin slammed his hands down on the table, thunder tore through the chamber shaking the young man violently.A small smile spread across his lips and his chest began to heave.Laughter bubbled up from inside of Odin and he found himself gripping his sides trying to contain his laughter.He wiped away a lone tear that streaked down his wrinkled cheek."Ah, my boy.It has been too long since I have laughed like that.It brings me great pleasure," he paused stifling another bout of laughter, "To banish you to Hel."The floor beneath the young man's feet vanished sending him plummeting through darkness to Hel waiting below.---
