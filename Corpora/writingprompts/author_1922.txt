[Poem]

Cars are evil; you won't miss them  
There are other vehicles to wreck  
We sing a capella  
Serving the lord of few candellas  
Drive your scooter into robot heck!Showing up to work is wrong  
When we all know you're suffering from flu  
Let us go inform HR  
Go grab the feathers and the tar  
We welcome you to level two!*Please tell me why?*  
You just weren't good enough for heaven  
*Your chintzy top hat must belie*  
...We turn *annoying* to eleven!*My crimes were not that bad!*  
*Surely everything's forgivable!*  
But the wages of these sins is livable!You leave the tap on while you brush  
Your wedding song was some dumb thing by Rush  
You never change the coffee pot  
Just a bot who's caught up in a hot gavotte  
Wrought this rot until you've got so hot you blush  

*Man, what a trek*  
The life you led was not too wild  
*Please, won't you let me double check?*  
The tortures here are kind of mild  
*I think I like it here in heck*  
Come on and climb these stairs  
This place is hell but built for squares  
We'll start after this next montage!*Is that guy getting a massage?*  

Browsing 4chan, posting cat pics  
And your favorite novel is just dreck  
You'll pay for every crime  
Compound interest grows with time  
Our singing lacks internal rhyme  
And every pie here is key lime  
Your sentence is a parsec trapped in heck!*But a parsec is...*  
This is heck.Deal with it.
