Adolf woke.He wasnt sure what had awakened him, but he found himself staring at the shadowy ceiling of his tiny flat just the same.It was quiet  so quiet that he was sure neither dawn nor dusk were anywhere close at hand  and yet, still he was awake.More awake, in fact, than he had felt in years.He shivered beneath his blanket despite the warmth, and lit a candle.What do you want? He asked the darkness.It felt right, he thought, to speak like this into the night.He could feel eyes on him, even if he wasnt sure anyone was really there.If he was wrong, no one would be the wiser.But if he was right

Hitler gasped as a hooded figure rose from the darkness at the foot of his bed, growing like a shadow at dusk.He clutched the covers closer to his chest.What are you!? He exclaimed.Some specter?Are you some devil, come to steal the breath from my lungs and soul from my flesh?Show yourself! 

To his surprise, the figure stopped, holding up a finger as if to ask for a moment while he fumbled with his hood.It seemed to bulge oddly, as if it were caught on something, but eventually he pulled it free.It was simply a man.Sorry.Must haveslipped?Never did like these cloaks. The figure said in halting German.He flashed Adolf a sheepish smile, and despite himself the pajama-clad man felt himself begin to smile as well.There was something about him, about the way he looked just a bit embarrassed beneath his disheveled bush of hair that was endearing.Despite that, however, he wasnt ready to relax just yet.Whowho are you?Why have you come here into my bedchambers so rudely, and without invitation? Adolf asked.Again, the man smiled.OhI dont think Im anyone that special. He said.Just ateacher?Is that the word?I work with paint, and I thoughtyou might enjoy getting to paint, a bit. 

Hitler blinked.Iwell, yes.I consider myself quite the expert, if I do say so.But why have you come?Are you from the school?You are no one I recognize. He looked the man up and down, and was struck by how odd he looked with his black cloak and his fuzzy head.It reminded him of something, though he couldnt quite put a finger on what it was.Well, no, not from the school exactly. The strange man said.I amfrom far away?The others, they havesealed this time off, yes?So no one else can come.You are rather unpopular, where I come from.Many have sought your life, though we have stopped them allwill have stopped them?You even stopped a few yourself, I think. 

Stopped?My life? Adolf asked, frowning.I have no recollection of this.Why do they seek to kill me?I have done no wrong to warrant it, at least in memory.

Yes, wellits all a bit complicated.Harder, too, in German.I cannot explain.Regardless, I was sent here asan apology.For things that havent, and will never happen.For my rudeness, I also apologize.Now was the only time I could come.It was the earliest we could reach before they started coming.Now, I must ask againwould you paint with me? 

*Pinsel!* Hitler exclaimed.*Ein pinsel*!I knew you looked like something!Yes, Mr. Pinsel, I will paint with you.If only because this is clearly a dream, and I have quite the love of painting. 

The man smiled.From somewhere within his cloak  where, Hitler couldnt imagine, as it was rather tight he withdrew a pair of easels, complete with canvas, paint, and brushes.Very well! He said.Let us paint! 

And so they did.The hours fled before their strokes, each of them trying to outdo the other in painting after painting.Hitler was surprised  though this man was clearly not German, he was still very, very good.Better, indeed, than Hitler himself, though he didnt want to admit it.But never once did he flaunt his superiority.Indeed, he made fun of his own imperfections, laughing and turning them into a beauty the likes of which Hitler had to admire.There are no mistakes. He explained.Merelyaccidents.Happy accidents. 

The man, too, was surprised at Adolf.In the history books, all they ever spoke of was the hatred, the atrocities.The monster.Instead, what he found before him was a man.A man like himself, filled with laughter and art and pain and joy and sorrow.Perhaps that was even more frightening than the beast.But soon, the sky outside the window turned from black to gray, and the candle burned low in its stand.Alas, Adolf, our time grows short. The man said.Im afraid I will need to be leaving soon. 

Ah!You speak truth, Mr. Pinsel.I forgot the hour!Though I am still not sure whether you were real or not, our time together was quite enjoyable.I hope that you come to visit again.Perhaps there is a thing or two I could learn. 

Yes.I thinkI think that would be nice. The cloaked man said, smiling sadly.Goodbye, Adolf.Good luck with your painting.I hope it brings you much joy, even when times are bleakest. He offered a hand.And you as well, my friend. Adolf replied.He grasped his hand, and was shocked to find a needle in his palm.At once, Hitler began to fall, only to be caught and dropped gently into bed by the cloaked stranger.The man shook his head.I dont know if I can call the mistakes you are going to make happy, Adolf, but you deserve the chance to make them.Thats only right. 

With a whirl of his cloak, Mr. Pinsel was gone, leaving nothing behind but a single canvas and a few drops of paint on the future tyrants bedclothes.

"Oh...hey, John.""Hey, Margarete."John sighed.Her bedroom was a mess - a total, absolute, pig-sty-hit-by-a-tornado kind of mess the likes of which made him cringe.Magazines, sheets, and even bits of old food covered the carpet like a layer of soil.But it was nothing compared to her.It was a familiar scene to John at this point.Her crying, sitting on the edge of her bed, not quite covering the bruises over her eyes.The apartment was different, at least, but the story was nothing new.New guy.New place.Same problem.He started to clean."How is Dave treating you these days, Mar?"He asked, feigning ignorance as he picked up a particularly crusty Playboy."Gone."She said, simply."He was cheating, like I thought.Like you thought, I guess.So I got out.""That's good news, Mar."John shot her a sad smile as he dumped the first pile into the trash."And the new guy is...?""Josh."Margarete said, quickly."He seemed so nice at the bar, paid for me and everything.A real gentleman.""But he hit you, didn't he."John said.Margarete didn't answer.He continued to clean in silence."You can't just...it wasn't his fault, Ok?He was drunk!"She finally snapped."Who the hell are you, coming in here, telling me how to live my life?With your...your good clothes, fancy shoes!I bet you never had to deal with any crap in your entire life!"Still, John was silent.He moved into the bathroom, which was somehow in an even worse state."I don't see any needles this time.Cutting back?"He called.This time, Margarete was silent.John kept cleaning."Mar?You still in there?"He asked, poking his head out into the other room.To his surprise, she was looking up at him, cheeks stained with tears.In her hands, she held a small stick made of cheap white plastic, half hidden behind her shaking fingers."John...I.It's not..." She stammered."I...I can't.I can't leave, not anymore."She held the object up, half displaying it to John as if she wasn't sure that she wanted him to see it."It's not just about me anymore."John swallowed, finally understanding."Whose...?"He asked.Margarete just shook her head."I don't know...it could have been Dave, I guess.But I can't go back there, John, I just can't!"John nodded."I understand."He said."But, Margarete...you can't stay here either.You know that.What will Josh do when he finds out?Or...did he already find out, and this is what he did to you?""I'm so scared, John!"Margarete sobbed."I don't know what to do, where to go..." 

"It's going to be ok, Mar.I promise."John said."Do you still have your cousin's number?Up in Newport?"Margarete nodded."Good.Go there, and don't look back.They'll help.""Thanks...John, I...Just.Thank you."Margarete said."I...I don't know what I'd do, if it weren't for you.Sometimes, I just wish we'd never broken up.Maybe things would have turned out different."John just chuckled."No, Margarete.I don't think it would have worked out.Besides, it would break my fianc's heart if I broke up with him now."Margarete stared."You're...?"John nodded.He blinked, and he was home.His real home - sitting on his bed, fully dressed in the dead of night, his partner breathing softly beside him.He hadn't waited up.John laid down and sighed, staring up at the ceiling.He had thought that the shock might have been enough to send him back, but her expression haunted him.Confusion, disgust...to think, for over a decade they had known each other, and she'd never thought to ask why he left.He only wished that he could have done more before he did.***

"...Bro?"Leonard stood at the base of the platform, arms crossed in frustration.He couldn't believe it.This sappy-looking, scrawny twit of a teenager had discovered what had taken him years - *years* - to figure out on his own.He had dedicated his entire life looking for a loophole in time travel, to get around the requirements of FTL travel and proximity to a black hole, and this idiot had gotten there first.What was more, instead of using his knowledge to benefit all of mankind, he had made himself king.*King!* How selfish could one person be?The king, on the other hand, beamed down on him."Yeah, bruh."He said."How'd ya do it?It was easy for me.See, it turns out we're in...like...a simulation, or something?"He said."I'm a little foggy on the details.Made the whole thing up while I was stoned...still kinda stoned, actually.They've got some wicked herbs here, man.But it all kinda just came to me, ya know?""It just...came to you?"Leonard asked.He shut his eyes, wishing he could forget everything he just heard."It took me over a decade to figure it out.At least you had the sense to dress the part.You...*did* dress the part, didn't you?"The monarch stared at him blankly."...No?At least...I don't think so?They didn't have jeans back now, did they?""No.No jeans."He said, smoothing his tunic."So where did you get the robes?Did the king just give them to you or something?"The boy grinned wider."Yeah man!"He said, showing off the purple cloth."He just sort of threw them at me the second I showed up!Was yelling something about a prophecy, but hey.I'm not gonna complain - free stuff!How much you think this crown is worth?""You should really have planned a bit better you know, if you were trying to go into the past."Leonard said."You could have gotten yourself killed!""Hey man.I didn't actually *plan* on anything."The teen said, frowning."It just sort of...happened.One moment, I'm laying on my back, looking at the universe through my third eye and stuff, and the next, *woosh!* There's this big purple portal, and I land myself right in the middle of the courtyard, ya know?"Leonard stared."You mean to say....you didn't actually do anything?"He asked."Nah, man."The teen said."In fact, I'm not a hundred percent sure this whole place is real.But if it isn't, this is one hell of a trip, ya know?"Leonard turned away, deep in thought.He, too, had seen the very same portal - though, it had been where and when he had been expecting it.Though, not exactly - if he was being honest, it had been a few seconds early.In truth, he wouldn't have stepped through it at all, had it not grown suddenly and launched itself at him like the mouth of an enormous worm.At the time, he had chalked it up to a simple miscalculation, but now he was not so sure."If you didn't mean to come here," He asked the boy, "and if I was brought here against my will...what on earth was that portal?""It was *my* doing."Said another voice, sonorous and deep.From behind the throne walked a man - old, with a white beard and periwinkle blue eyes that seemed to pierce straight through Leonard's heart.He wore robes long enough to scrape the floor, a pointed hat, and an expression that was equal parts sorrow and joy."I am Merlin."Said the man."Leonard, Arthur...we have much work to do.I pray that we might start now."

"Good evening."Farrow jumped."Who's there?"He called.Quickly stripping the thick goggles from his head, he glanced around the empty lab.It was dark and quiet - the kind of quiet that only comes out in a busy place after midnight, once the everyone had long ago left for home.Everyone except for Farrow, of course."I know you're back there, behind the doorway."He said, eyes narrowing."Come out into the light so I can see you."The woman - for she was a woman - laughed almost imperiously."I wasn't trying to hide, Farrow.But I will honor your request."With two luxurious strides, the woman stepped into the circle of light that surrounded Farrow's desk like a halo.Farrow gulped.She had long, dark hair that flowed nearly to her waist, with skin the color of honeyed milk.Though she wore warm clothing that obscured her form, she was easily the most beautiful woman that Farrow had ever seen."Who *are* you?"He asked, filled with wonder.Then, regaining some of his composure, he pressed on, "And how did you get in here?The doors are all locked, no one should have been able to even get inside!""Oh, I have ways of getting into places on my own terms."The woman said, coyly."But I needn't have used them.You invited me here yourself, Farrow."Farrow blinked."That's twice now you've used my name, but I don't think I have introduced myself...nor have you given me yours.Tell me what's going on!""I think you know."The woman replied, smirking."As far as who I am, we have met before - though I doubt you could remember it.You may call me Kalika...and if what I have heard is true, we will be quite the pair."Farrow's eyes widened in realization."The time travel project!So you're...from the future?But our theories only indicate that forward travel is possible..." 

"Not all things you consider impossibilities are impossible, Farrow.My very presence here should prove that."Kalika smiled, and Farrow was disconcerted to notice that her canines were oddly pointed."Speaking of which...how is your prototype coming along?"She gestured to a twisted mass of metal in the corner of the room.It seemed to be made of nothing but rings, a chair, and a control panel rigged together with a few screws."Scrapped."Farrow sighed, forgetting for a moment who he was speaking to."The powers that be deemed it too dangerous, they never even wanted me to test it."Kalika grinned."Why don't you...give it a little whirl just the same?"Without waiting for him to give an answer, she grabbed his arm and began to steer him towards the strange device."I...don't...think..." Farrow protested, squirming under Kalika's surprisingly strong grip.Deftly, she began punching numbers into the controls faster than Farrow's eyes could follow, and the machine whirred to life at her touch.Farrow let out a cry and began trying to power the device down, but she simply swatted his hand away and continued to work.Just as the first ring began to spin, she withdrew back into the lab, leaving Farrow trapped in a whirling tornado of steel."What have you done!?"Farrow yelled, dismayed.But no matter how much he hammered away at the controls, the machine never responded."Don't worry so very much...my love."She smiled again, pointed canines glinting."See you in a hundred years..."

And with a flash of blue-white light, Farrow was gone.
