I'm going to get it right this time
Lavender shampoo, because she loves the smell
No talk of god, because she doesn't believe in hell 
She can't bare children, she's scared of the life she would hold
Take it slow, from the lies she's been told
I'm going to get it right this time
Khaki pants, no cut up jeans 
Rice and quinoa over frank and beans
Don't talk so much about yourself
You've lived for years,
She's crying, I'm crying
Who's are these tears?
