''I've fought this battle for 12 long years.It finally seems that I've been granted an answer."I reach for the knife, spilling a bottle of Ambien on the table.I cradle my last whiskey as the knife caresses my stomach.The crimson curtain falls as I plunge the knife into my intestines.A sharp pain, and then relief.Suddenly, waves crash upon the shore as seagulls cry in the distance.My eyes open to a swiftly tilting  earth, identical to that I once knew."Fuck."
