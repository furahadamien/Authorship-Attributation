Unfortunately, St. Peter has that library.My entry is by decade and I'm almost half way through the seventh.(And the last for my just passed dear wife of 54 years plus 4 years a-courtin.So far, unable to get my mind around this fact.)Well, St. Pete, like me and my Kindle, just ignore all those footnotes.
