"It's all about letting go" The Time Traveller explains in a quiet voice, picking through her words carefully as though she didn't often use them.'Letting go of self, letting go of others, letting go of fear and letting go if love.'She finishes in her head, her eyes skittering away from his at the end."That still doesn't explain it.Why do you do it?"The Immortal persists.They're in a roofless caf in Paris, which is made up of two upright walls and an oddly pristine dinner table set up between them.When she lays her head on the table to avoid his gaze, he follows, his eyes seeking to hold hers.She looks over the singed remnants of paintings on the one wall and at the crushed sculptures not much further away.The metal groans of a mangled Eiffel Tower flare up with each gust of wind and bring with it the song of heartbreak, the scent of a city burning.She stares ahead blankly into the bright white burst of light from a nearby explosion, then fixes her eyes at a spot above his unruly curls.His closeness warms her, his very presence grounding her to this reality.Each time traveling jaunt leaves her cold and exhausted, her limbs weak and her coordination disjointed after having submerged herself into the murky nothingness beyond time.Only to find her way back to this, back to him."You have a ...passion... for life, I sometimes avoid it.You enjoy the daily madness that is humanity and revel in the mess."She responds, her shaky arm encompassing the rubble within the 'mess'.
"I prefer to watch over all of earth's wonders from afar and delight in them without *disrupting* them."She finishes, piercing him with a meaningful look.It is the most she's ever said in three centuries.He's surprised by her openness, emboldened by it... And the fact that they have precious little time left.His hand reaches out to hers across the table and she flinches away, tucking both arms around her torso - tightly.His face falls.He reasons that he should be used to being rejected by her, she does it every century or so.Still... She is wearing his shirt after all.She did come back to him and they are finally in a caf in Paris, as per her wish the last time."You might want to skip this viewing.It's a war unlike any other.Everybody is trying to kill each other now for profit or cookie points."He advises her with an audible sigh.It was time to go."What did you do?Why would someone be trying to kill you?"She asks, dark eyes widening.He would have shrugged off her question, as if he wasn't a prime target for his 'impressive regenerative abilities' and his equally impressive skill of building technology that, while well intended, could wreak havoc.He would have taken her deep into some forgotten wilderness with a few yogis or monks, and survived to see her again in some other time.It would've all worked out quite ordinarily for the both of them.But reflecting in the darkness of her eyes, he spots the familiar red flare of a portal opening behind them.A single shared  look and they abandon their chairs, dropping to the ground beneath the table as one.Mere seconds later a flash of heat sears the air where their heads had been."I see your portal technology works now.Congratulations."Her eyes cut at him more effectively than the blasts of heat now raining down on them from enemy fire."I wonder what else you've made, to turn the world into such chaos?"She shouts over the din.He knows he has a great deal of explaining to do but he also knows what he did was for the greater good.Initially.How was he to know that his work had the power to start a war?She did warn him about trying to change the future, granted.Yet she'd also kissed him before disappearing for nine decades.In his mind they were both failing at changing the future."Did I ever tell you how beautiful you are?"He teases, diving for her and pulling her close -much closer than strictly required- before they both disappear into a newly forged, red tinged hole in the ground
