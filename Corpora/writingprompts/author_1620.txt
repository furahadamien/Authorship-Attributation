I jumped out of bed as soon as my alarm went off, rushing to pull on clothes before racing down the stairs.The sound of sizzling and the smell of breakfast assaulted my sense as leaped down the last few steps.I made a beeline for the kitchen.Ma, what's for breakfast? I asked, hoping it was my favorite.She set a heaping plate down in front of me and kissed my forehead as I dug in with gusto.Today's your birthday baby.After you eat, go on into the living room and we'll open your presents


My brows furrowed as I looked at her, confusion written across my face, my head fuzzy as I thought about her words.But mom.. wasn't yesterday my birthday?


She only smiled


Silly boy, every day is your birthday!


I finished eating my food but still couldn't shake the odd feeling that something weird was going on.A massive case of Deja Vu.It made my tummy feel sick.Something didn't seem right.I slid out of my chair and headed for the living room, plopping down on the couch.Even that felt familiar, as if I had done it the exact same way, a hundred times over.Mom came into the room carrying a few big wrapped presents and I pushed the weird feeling out of my mind, too excited at the prospect of presents to care.I immediately tore into them with her blessing.As I sorted through my spoils, I couldn't help but feel as if something was missing, a specific present gone.I looked at mom in confusion.The next thing I knew, I was laying in bed again, my alarm buzzing from my bedside table.I jumped out of bed, shutting the alarm off and rushing to pull on clothes before racing down the stairs.The sound of sizzling and the smell of breakfast assaulted my sense as leaped down the last few steps.I made a beeline for the kitchen.Ma, what's for breakfast? I asked, hoping it was my favorite.She set a heaping plate down in front of me and kissed my forehead as I dug in with gusto.Today's your birthday baby.After you eat, go on into the living room and we'll open your presents

I looked around and immediately felt queasy as all the memories came rushing back.It was my birthday and mom tried her best, like she always does.Dad had died two years ago, and we were totally on our own.Mom had saved the best present for last, a state-of-the-art VR headset.When she went to retrieve it, she had collapsed on the way back.I tried to give her CPR and save her but she was already gone.I didn't want them to take me away from her, she was all I had.So I curled up next to her body and put the VR headset on my head.I'd spend every single day with her until i was gone as well.We'd have the best time.Later, the police told me when the school hadn't seen me for a while, and the landlord reported us missing, they came to investigate.Mom had missed a month of the rent and her phone got shut off.She sacrificed so much to give me the best birthday.The least I could do was enjoy it, as much as possible.(I realize this was a bit off prompt but, this is what I came up with.Please go easy on me)
