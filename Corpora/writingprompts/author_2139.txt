Jack was a nice guy.He really was.When I ran him over, I was scared to death.I got out instantly and saw him lying there on the ground, dead."Shit" I mutter.I just killed a man.I looked closer, realizing this as Jack Marize.He lived on my street and attended the street parties.We weren't that close of friends, but we talked sometimes.He bought me a drink once and told me not to worry about it.He would participate in community service hours.He was in the lower class, but he still donated a third of his salary to charity."Oh, Jack."Suddenly pain flares through my head.Pictures flash by my eyes.My body begins to shake and my eyes roll up."WELCOME TO THE GAME, JACK.KILL OR BE KILLED, THE CHOICE IS YOURS.THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE JACK OF ALL TRADES."My shaking body stops.My eyes return to focus.Reality grabs onto me.But something is different.I can't place my finger on it yet.I stumble to my feet and see the dead Jack on the ground.Suddenly, I realize what it is.I can fix sinks and toilets and...I'm a plumber.I look down at Jack, realizing he, too, is a plumber.Was that some sort of coincidence?No...I was a plumber because I killed a plumber named Jack.A plumber with my same name.I pick up the corpse, blood dripping out of his crushed leg, and carry him to the side of the road.I toss him off and begin to cover his body with sticks.I arrive home later that night, a phone book in my arms.I carry it inside and open it.J... Ja.... Jack.There were six Jack's in the book including me and Jack Marize.Four left...I arrive at a house at seven P.M.The sun is setting  behind a mountain.I knock on the door, a knife hidden against my back.I have a box in my hands.I knock again, waiting.Footsteps echo through the house.The door opens and Jack Arblont is standing in front of me."Here is a package" I say shoving it into his arms.He takes it, confused.Suddenly the knife is in my hand.I swing it at him.He stumbles back and falls, the box falling on top of him, containing six cans of soda.I pounce on him when he screams for help.I hear a frantic cry upstairs when I slash Jack Arblont's neck open.He goes silent and still.I hear footsteps running down the stairs.I jump up and sprint out the open door to cries of sadness behind.Jack Arblont was a free climber and recorded his stunts.He had the ability to manage cameras with one hand while hanging off a cliff, climb insane  and slopes, jump higher than the average human and had incredible climbing strength and speed.One moment I would be no match against him in a climbing contest.The next, we would be side by side in an intense competition.Three Jack's left.My knife concealed at my side, my skills concealed inside me, I waited at the entrance to Jack Figalo's house.The door creaked open and adrenaline rushed through my veins.Then I see a small boy standing in front of the door."Hello" he says.He couldn't be more than seven."Is Jack Figalo home?""I'm Jack Figalo.""What?""That's me.My name is Jack Figalo.""But...Your name is in the phone book for this house?""Yeah.My dad's name is Jack Figalo too, but he was killed three days ago."Killed three days ago.Did that mean?Other Jack's were also looking for me?"What did you need?""What?""You said you were looking for Jack Figalo.That's me."Guilt ran through my bones.Could I really kill a child... just for more skill.What could this boy even give me?*One Jack of all trades.* Words rang through my head.The boy would have to go.The seizure happened anyways, though no information was automatically downloaded in my head.I was still filled with guilt, knowing I really messed up.*Only be one Jack.* The words pushed me on.Two left.I continued my journey.Jack Lansan would be a harder target.He was a retired veteran and a police officer.I stood outside his house.His roof was low and light flooded from the windows.I could hear conversation coming from inside.I started developing a plan...I rung the doorbell than jumped up, clinging to the roof.I swung myself over until I was on the roof.The knife was clutched in my hand, now stained red on almost all the blade.The door opened and a figure stepped out.I was ready to pounce.Than I realized she was a woman.She looked left, then right."No one's even hear, Jack" she called inside."Jen?Jen!Get inside.Lock the door!Don't go out again."The door shut and a bullet pierced through the wood.This would be a problem.Jack Lansan would have to wait.I went to the next house, the home of Jack Poller and knocked.The door opened and a young woman, maybe seventeen, stepped out.Her eyes were red."Jack Poller?"Tears fell down her face."He was murdered.""I'm sorry.""Thank you.What did you want with him?"*Oh just to kill him.* "To give my apologies.He was a good man."One left.Jack Lansan killed two other Jacks, I assumed.Although, I killed three, I still only had the knowledge of two of them.I still regretted that decision.I was perched on the roof of Jack Lansan's house, waiting.Soon enough, a car pulled in the driveway and out stepped a man in a police uniform.A gun was still strapped to his belt.That could be useful.He walked down the path to the front door.I was ready with a pile of knives and one large steak knife to do the final job.Behind the cover of the roof, I picked up two of the throwing knives and stood up, chucking them toward Jack Lansan.Moments later, two more flew past.One of the knives handle hit his chest.He jumped back as another one slammed into the ground where he just was.A bullet hit the roof I was behind.Luckily, it didn't make it through.I peeked out the other side of the roof and chucked two more knives.One impaled his shoulder.The other sailed harmlessly past."Ahg!"He let out a strangled scream.I peeked again and saw his gun on ground.I jumped off the roof and sprinted toward him.I kicked the gun away and pushed him to the ground raising the steak knife... "Drop it!"The voice was behind me.I had the blade to Jack Landan's throat.I looked over my shoulder.His wife was standing there, the gun in her hand, pointed right toward me."Drop the knife" she ordered."I will after you drop the gun" I say."Drop the gun or he dies."Jack Lansan shouted to his wife."No!Don't trust him.He's after the power of Jack!""What are you talking about?""Just ask his name" Jack Lansen shouted."My name is Don.And I am arresting you for the killing of two good men: Jack Poller and Jack Figalo.""What?"His wife screeched."I'm sorry Mrs. Lansan.Your husband has committed the crime of murderer.I just want to bring him in to treat and question him.""HE'S AFTER THE POWER OF JACK.DO NOT TRUST HIM JEN.""I can treat him" I assured her."We can make him better.Just drop the gun.""I just want my husband back."She was crying.I heard the gun fall."NO!JEN SHOOT HIM!SHOOOOT HIM!!!"My hand pressed down more, slashing his neck.I got up and sprinted away to the sobs of Jen Lansen.A bullet flew past, but her aim was no match of what mine was about to become.*About to become.* My body dropped like a rock and the seizure began.It was three times more painful than normal.Jack Lansen was a veteran in the military and a cop.His aim with his gun was incredible.He could hit a bulls eye with his eyes closed.He had indurance of a marathon runner.You never knew what might happen on the job.He had extensive knowledge of most weapons and knew how to handle them better than most.He also knew how to drive.His police car had to beable to navigate extensive traffic issues.When it came to being a cop, Jack Lansen knew mostly all there was.Jack Figalo was a college professor.He had extreme intelligence, especially in the form of Physics, the class he taught and Jackson University.He could get students to cooperate, and could be nice and strict at the same time.Jack Poller was a waiter.He had an uncanny ability to remember orders and balance plates.He was very friendly and social and could normally get customers to keep on buying food.Pain erupted in my leg just as the pain in my head stopped."You son of a bitch!"My surroundings cleared and I saw the face of Jen Lansen above me."Why!"She shot me again in the other leg.I screamed out a sob of pain."Why!"She was screaming at me.My body was on fire.The preservance of six Jacks' kept me going.I reached for a knife at my belt.She screamed at me again and shot at my arm.The bullet hit the concrete next to it and I went still.She pounced on me, dragging my arm out and beating it with the cold, hard piece of metal.I cried out in agony as she just went harder."Stop.Please.""FUCK YOU!"She went on, beating on my arm.It felt flat and deflated.I could feel blood soaking through the skin like orange juice soaking through the peel.She kneeled over me now."Fuck you."She aimed the gun at my other arm when I made a grab for it.I got the barrel in my grasp.She tugged it upward, but I held on tightly, the punishment of death and Six Jacks driving me on.I pushed it away, but she pushed it back.I was injured and weak, she was angry and strong.I tried to get it from her grip and she tried to get it from mine.We were both screaming now, at eachother, at the pain of loss, at the sheer shit that life gave us.It was like an endless tug a war match, with a gun.Whoever lost, died.I'll just say it was a very close match...
