Cypraea
We had about ten seconds to gape in disbelief, and then the sound of a pen tapping against a pad of paper became, somehow, too omnipresent to ignore.(How does that happen?Your kid just *disappeared through a pillar* in defiance of all laws of physics and oh wait, somebody's *tapping something*, gotta devote one's entire brain capacity to *that*.Maybe there *is* magic.)We turned, and there was a fairy.I shit you not, an actual, honest-to-god fairy with the sparkling, glowing glitter wings and a three-piece suit that somehow managed to say "government agent" and "traffic cop" all at once.Shorter than either of us, but human-sized; blonde, no-nonsense hair, too young to be anyone's fairy godmother, but not some youthful, ageless Disney fairy either.As we turned, she started to write on the ticket pad."I'm with the Department of Protection of Children's Hopes and Dreams, and I'm charging you with Second Degree Malicious Harm By Deception To A Child's Dreams and First Degree Raising False Hopes With Intent To Crush."She pronounced all the capital letters somehow, let us stare blankly at her for a couple seconds, and continued."If you had succeeded, I would also have cause to charge you with Doing Significant Damage To A Child's Capacity For Belief, which is a hate crime against magical beings."*That* got her a widening of eyes from me and a confused sound from Sara; how do you commit a hate crime against something you don't know exists?Her eyes are steel as she explains."You will recall from your educational viewings of *Peter Pan* that fairies die when not believed in?It is an unavoidable tragedy when an adult stops believing, but for a child to have his belief in magical things cruelly crushed out of him at a tender age not only damages *his* psyche but will likely kill two or three fairies whom his belief ought to have sustained."She smiled, and it was not a nice smile."Here are your tickets; your court date is the nineteenth; you can find it by wandering in the woods most immediately in the direction of your backyard from your house until you find a circle of mushrooms.Step into it without crushing any mushrooms and the courthouse will be the third fairy mound on the right."There was another moment of stunned silence before Sara found her voice and asked, "So ...is there a fine for these ...charges?""No fine," said the fairy."You will be assigned remedial parenting classes and instructed on how to act as proper muggle parents to a wizard child."She followed my gaze to the pillar where our son had disappeared."He will be returned to you for the Christmas holidays, and will keep returning for the rest of his seven years of Hogwarts.""So ..."my voice shook a little."Hogwarts really exists?JK Rowling didn't make it all up?""Of course JK Rowling made it up," the fairy snapped."How else would it have come to exist?""I---thousand-year history, you know, back in the medieval days---" I read the Harry Potter books to him and looked up answers to his questions on the internet and forged a Hogwarts acceptance letter for him, I'd managed to become quite the expert on the place's history and this twisted my brain like Last Thursdayism, which gives me a headache every time I make an attempt to understand it."People create stories," said the fairy, more gently, "and other people believe in them.This requires that they become true, so that belief may be preserved for us who live off of belief."She paused to make sure I was following and then pointed to the pillar."Your son is arriving in the Fairy realm, where he will find a castle, a school for magic, and hundreds of children like himself who believe in Hogwarts, and Hogwarts as such will be made real for them.""But what happens when he grows up?"asked Sara."Does he stop believing?Does it ...kill fairies when he does?""He will believe," said the fairy, "or not believe, based on his own analyses.Some adults return to the mundane, their childhoods retreating to a dream; others remain.""Do you mean he'll be trapped in Fairyland forever?"I snapped, hands closing into fists, not caring if she thought it was a threat.She met my anger, supremely unimpressed."No.A paper-pusher in the Ministry of Magic, a paper-pusher in the local courthouse, what's the difference save what's in the records?If he stays, he will come home, and gravitate to a job he can find magical at the edges, and teach his children to believe."My anger evaporating, I looked to the pillar, and to Sara; she looked back at me, shamefaced.We'd expected to have ourselves a hell of a laugh over what we're fast realizing to be a bit of a cruel prank.Then Sara smiled, faintly, a tiny curve of her lips that told me she was up to something."Other places from stories, like Hogwarts, exist?"she asked the fairy.The fairy lit up slightly.I mean, literally.Glowing, like she had a night light inside her."Oh, yes.Any story, if a child believes it, we create it for them.""Thank you," said Sara, and turned to me as the fairy turned away and disappeared in between one wing-flap and the next.People rushed around us, so intent on their own destinations and smartphones, so lost in their own little worlds, that I could easily believe half of them were off in Narnia or Middle-Earth.Sara pulled out her cell phone, and I watched her bring up the gallery, scrolling past our photos, taken this morning, of a beaming boy in Hogwarts robes, to a shot from last night: our daughter, age six, her hair tied up in Princess Leia buns, fighting off imaginary stormtroopers with a Super Soaker."I think she'd make a good Jedi, don't you?"
