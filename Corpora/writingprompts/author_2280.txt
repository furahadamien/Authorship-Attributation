"So mrs Borothone, you were at the bank during the robbery.Is this correct?"&nbsp;  
"Yes.I was there, with my ex-husband.We were there because we needed somehow to split our joint bank account after our divorce."&nbsp;  
The officer nods."Is it correct also that while the bank was being robbed and everyone else was getting shot, you were ushured into the back room to.. 'sit it out'?Am I correct in this assumption?"&nbsp;  
"Yes."&nbsp;  
"Do you know why?Are you connected to the Abonici in any way?"&nbsp;  
"I don't know exactly why I was unharmed.And I remember having a girlfriend named Agatha Abonici in highschool."_____  
The weirdest thing after the small layover at the station was how... civil it was.No "good cop, bad coop", or tied to a chair and spat on.No cuffs, either.Was a rather plesant experince, despite.Makes you think._____  
Supprisingly, finding *who* Abonici was was rather different than meeting the syndacite in person.They had a sparse yet easily-traceable digital fingerprint, and acctually finding out *what* Aconici was was the hardest.Turns out they're a crime syndacte, and that cute Aggie was the daughter and heiress - now leader - of it.As a kind gentalman said to me as he pointed out the way to the local dive where they hang out said: 'they've gots morales, see?They don't harm no-one on their do-not-harm list.Nobody gonin' go hurt 'em cause they're got the people, and the honour.Don't get on their bad side, they can (pardon my french miss) fuck you up 100 ways to sunday and no knowing who finds your body'.&nbsp;  
I got there, and everybody stood up almost immediently.They knew who I was, despite me not knowing what the fuck was going on.Shocked, I was.A big, shithouse-sized man stood on a table and bellowed: "RIGHT!YOU LOT HERE, WE'VE GOT A HARMLESS HERE.NO BEING SHITTY TO HARMLESS, AND NO MESSIN' ARROUND!ANY LEERS AND PEVERTS WILL BE KICKED OUT!AM I CLEAR?"&nbsp;  
A general murmer of *yes Mac* and *yessir* and *alright* went through the men and women here and they went back to their games and drinks.The barman went back to cleaning a glass and stared at me like I had two heads.I tried to avoid the gaze, but I wanted information, and bit the bullet and went up.&nbsp;  
He says to me "So.You're a Harmless.What do you want?It's on the house."
