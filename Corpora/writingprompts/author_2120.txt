Macabre_Mysterys
[Poem]

Gentle rain falling down, a quiet voice said "Turn around"

A bittersweet look in her eyes, an angered look locked in mine.'She's the one who's caused my pain, she's the one who's clothes will be stained.'A silver revolver shined in the light, a hand around the handle nice and tight."What are you doing?Put that down!"Her once quiet voice loud with sound.I held the gun up to her head, the cause of my suffering would finally be dead.A loud bang echoed around, the once lively girl fell on the ground.A smile was plastered on my face, hearing the screams surrounding the place."I always loved that sound."
