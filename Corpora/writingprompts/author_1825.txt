One of my childhood's best memories other than my family lies with the pet canine, an extension of our joint family.A center stage of attention to everybody associated with us, very obedient, loyal, sensitive and a true companion to all of us.All those memories linked with him going to be a lifelong asset for good and helps me to develop values and meaning of relations.They never betray or left you irrespective of the circumstances and served till their last breath no matter how you treat them.The bond grows stronger and re-establish our faith towards the spirit, faith, stay true to ourselves and all those care's and made sacrifices for your presence.Let's reward them for their unquestioned services, be gentle, true master and strengthen the essence of humanity.
