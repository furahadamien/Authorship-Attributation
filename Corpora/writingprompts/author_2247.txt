Species: Magnacrania Terrensis

Location: Mining planet of Gayanite

Circumstance of find: chance discovery during a routine expedition from the aeropolis to the planets lowland plains to collect the giant crystals of citrine quartz that grow around the planets innumerable lavaflows, fossil was uncovered when the machinery accidentally caused part of the bank to collapse, revealing the specimen and its associated artifacts to the crew

Specimen description: Bipedal with a stable gate, two limbs attached to the upper thorax tipped with digits capable of manipulating objects, two additional limbs attached to the bottom of the abdomen ending in a group of digits likely held together with muscle in life to provide a source of stability for the creature as it moved, cranium attaches to a spine that runs vertically along the thorax and abdomen, brain shape and size indicates this creature was capable of higher thought.Associated finds: A data terminal, that appears to function as a record of their species history.Approximate age of specimen: 1.8 billion years

Classification: Extinct

Reason for extinction: According to the data terminal that was buried with the being the planet it inhabited was much different to that of today, life thrived on a surface dominated by grassland and patches of forest.Their species progressed slowly at first, remaining at relatively the same technology level for over 300,000 years, then suddenly in the space of about 12,000 years their technology level improved exponentially (likely triggered by the discovery of agriculture) but alas all was not perfect for them, they began to poison and destroy their planet all in the name of greed, the individual found hailed from a time at the very end of this process where the species appeared to have a change of tune and wished to save their biosphere, however their efforts were unsuccessful to put it mildly, we know this thanks to the data terminal also containing the following log (translated for the reader): 

Are we on?Please be on.... Bingo!Thank god, almost thought this whole thinga woulda been in vain *sigh*....Anyway, if you're listening to this you already know the bad news, life on Earth has come to an end, I'm hear to say why.*clears voice* In the year 2438 a series of natural disasters and extinction events crippled Earth's biosphere, it soon became clear that we were going extinct along with all life on the planet, then around the summer of 2340 they discovered element 160.At first it seemed to be just another unstable radioactive element, that all changed when a chance fluctuation of electrical voltage during testing of its properties caused it to violently rip a hole in the fabric of spacetime, killing all scientists working on the project.However the drone recording the incident managed to entre and return from the other side of the hole, after analysing the footage, various palaeontologists and other scientists concluded that the drone had been transported back 4 million years ago to the late pliocene period.Naturally someone realised we could simply take extinct animals back from the past and save our biosphere here in the present, for the entirity of testing everything seemed like it was going to turn out fine, they calculated they'd need about a ton of element 160 to make the various trips to retrieve the animals and save our planet.But... *tears welling up* *voice trembling* while they were firing a proton b... beam at it to op..p...pen the rift one of the struts holding up the chunk of element came loose..... *full on crying* and it fell and exploded.*wipes away tears* *+ voice trembling again* the ex..p..plosion's so powerful they think there's only about an hour until the entire earth's surface is b...b..burned to ashes.*heavy breathing* *panicked voice* I see the debris cloud, I don't have much time *frantic pleading* whoever you are don't make our mistakes.Please!*crying again* don't let your world en... *sound of debris cloud arriving* *+ agonised screaming*
