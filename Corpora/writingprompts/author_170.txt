I always watch the news, mostly night but rarely ever mornings.As the news changes, i get a text, "DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON" followed by texts by the storms telling me to look at the moon.I assumed as most of us were to assume, spam.But one thing i found strange.I had a backup phone and i got the same texts of looking at the moon.But no warning.When i questioned it, the news came on, warning others about not looking at the moon, i knew it was no joke because his face looked tearful and serious.As i listen, the reporter says, nearly breaking down "The symptoms that can develop when looking at the moon will follow; Slow heartbeat, high blood pressure, suicidal thoughts, and weakness" I was scared at this point, disabling texts.I go to twitter and ask what's going on... No replies.I ask on facebook.One reply that looks like a bots doing telling me to look how beautiful the moon is tonight.Worried for my friends and family i attempt to call them... No responses... Now breaking down.I get a message on facebook from Zack telling me that life isn't worth it anymore.As he then blocks me.I hear a gunshots, by gunshots... As i tremble i cry out slowly... my best friend is gone and I'm alone...I ask myself what's the point and go look at the moon...It looks beautiful...
Beautiful...
Beautiful...
