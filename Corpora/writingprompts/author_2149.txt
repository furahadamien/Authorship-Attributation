**ANOTHER TYPICAL DAY IN CENTRAL CITY - THE CITIZENS GO ABOUT THEIR DAILY BUSINESS, THE BIRDS SING - AND A BANK IS ROBBED!**

BOOM!*"Right, let's get out of there, Technofiend!"*

    "I OBEY, HELLVIXEN."*"You don't always have to talk like that, Tech."*

    "Soz.""MU-HA-HA-HA!Our evil plan reaches fruition!Soon, we will have the funds to build an army of evil clones - and then, rule the world!"*"Dr. Deviant, could you not monologue until you've got the car going?"*

"Alright, alright..."

**BUT EVEN AS THE VILLAINS TRY TO ESCAPE JUSTICE, A HERO COMES FROM THE SKY!!!**

"Halt, Evildoers!""Oh shit, it's Captain Cosmos."*"What the hell is he doing out at his age?"*

"He must have got out of his daughter's house again..."

    "I thought she got locks put in?"*"He can still break rocks with his fists, you know."*

    "Oh.""I'm going to talk to him..."

*"Dr. Deviant - are you sure?"*

"I can't believe she let him keep that police scanner!""Well, it keeps him occupied, doesn't it?"*"Not like this."*

**SLOWLY, THE EVIL DOCTOR DEVIANT EMERGES FROM HIS GETAWAY...**

"Hi, Mike?""Captain Cosmos To You!""Yeah, OK, Captain Cosmos.Look, Cassie is probably wondering where you are, and..."

"How Do You Know The Name Of My Daughter?""You told me, remember?The last time you arrested me.""Did I?""Yeah.Look, let's drive you back or something?""NO!Evildoers Must Be Brought To Justice!""Oh God..."

**MEANWHILE, IN THE CAR, AN EVIL SCHEME IS HATCHED...**

*"I have absolutely no idea what we're going to do here."*

    "Shall I ring social services?"*"It's heading in that direction."*

**BUT CAPTAIN COSMOS HAS NO TIME FOR SUCH PLOTS.IT IS TIME FOR ACTION!**

"Enough!Surrender, Or Feel My Wrath!""Careful Mike, you don't wanna..."

**KAPOW!**

"Oh shit!Your hip!"**POW!**

"Arrgh!"*"Oh no, has he fallen over?"*

"Yeah, can you come over?I'm going to need your help."I'll ring the ambulance.""Thanks, Tech.""You Fiends!I Will Not Allow This Villainy!"Calm down, Mike.Let Hellvixen check your hip out.

*Does that hurt?*

AIIIIEEEEEE!

*Ill take that as a yes.*

    "The ambulance is coming.""Right, I'll stay here with him until we get to the hospital."*"They'll bust you when you get there..."*

"I know.Can you break me out of the City Jail again?"*"You'll have to wait until the weekend, I'm afraid."*

"Meh.What can you do?""You Will Be Brought To Justice, Dr.Deviant!""Just try to stay calm, Mike.Ambulance should be here."*"Shall we leg it, then?"*

"May as well, Hellvixen.""I'm guessing we're paying for his treatment?"*"Yeah.He can't afford it, anyway."*

    "Ah, what can you do?""Shit, Cops are coming.See you on Saturday?"*"Yep!"*

"Once Again, Captain Cosmos Puts The Villains To Flight!""Come on, Mike... Let's just get you looked at first."**SOON, THE HEROIC CAPTAIN COSMOS IS BEING RUSHED TO HOSPITAL, FLANKED BY HIS ARCH NEMESIS.**

"You OK there, Mike?""Dr Deviant!You - I - I... Where Am I?An Ambulance?What The Hell Did I Just Do?"You fell over and busted your hip.Wed just knocked off a bank, and you were trying to stop us

Oh Shit, Not Again!

"You having a lucid moment?""Right Now I Am, But I Don't Know How Long It Will Last.The Doctor Says It's Getting Worse.I Don't Want To End Up In A Chair Someday, Dribbling Over Myself.""I'm sorry, Mike.""For What?You Dirtbags Always Come Through.Not Like The 'Good Guys', Not Any More.They Just Let You Go When You Slow Down.Sometimes I Think They're Ashamed To Even Be Seen With Me.""There's a very fuzzy line between being a Super Hero and a Super Villain.It's very easy to cross.""I Know.But I Gotta Question For You Now.""Yeah, Mike?""Why?""My Dad used to tell me stories about you, back in your prime.The good old days.There were real legends then, on both sides.The battles, the evil schemes, the heroic rescues...It all seemed to mean something back then.He was your biggest fan, in a weird sort of way."The Asshole Used To Send Me Christmas Cards.""It was me that did the crayon drawings of Santa.""Really?""Yeah.""Wow.""But you know what Dad would tell me, in-between planning to take over the world?""That I Was His Arch Enemy?""That and this - you're only ever as good as your opposition.""We're Getting Near To The Hospital, I Think.""It's been an honour, Mike.""Look, I - I Need To sleep.The Painkillers Are Making Me Drowsy.""Shall I call Cassie?""Yeah.Number's In My Utility Belt.""Thanks.Look, I'm sorry.This isn't the way it should have turned out.""..."

"You asleep?Probably for the best."**THE END**
