The immortal one was using fire to heat something in a spoon again.I knew that every time I saw that damned spoon I would not get my food.It would be one of those nights that the hunger would keep me awake again.The immortal mumbled something incomprehensible for a while and then the immortal one fell asleep in its soft sitting place.I used to climb on the immortals sitting place when the immortal one was away.It all ended when he caught me that one time.I still have a scar on my neck to remind me of that horrible day.I decided to go to my corner and try to get some sleep.After some time I noticed that the horrible immortal sleeping sound had ended.I walked to the immortal one and saw that it was not moving, not even breathing.I knew this was the time to take action.I sank my teeth into the immortal ones flesh.After maybe tenth bite I started to feel something strange flowing through myself....was this it.... will I become the immortal one?
