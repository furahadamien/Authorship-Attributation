Me and my dwarf brothers live in a cave with a dog.We always send Joseph out to get our liquor and make sure we always got enough to make us through the night.One day, Joseph got into a car accident and couldn't drive up to that liquor store and get us our cheap whiskey!realizing that we would soon die of dehydration without a drink, everyone started to panic.I took it upon myself to go fetch us some vodka or a few drinkypoos of anything, really.I was losing my buzz!I stumbled out of the cave and looked for any transportation, couldn't  find any, so I had to use the dog.He was a German shepherd so I figured he could carry me.Me and my dog went up to the corner store, only to realize I had $3 and not a nickel of change.Least I had my id, I thought, my dog carried me on his back into the store and we grabbed a 40.On the way back to the cave, I thought, this 40 ain't gonna be enough for me and all my brothers!So I gave it to momma and the rest of us had to go sober, least for the night.Joseph and Alan left to go get beer, but I decided to brave it out and see what happens.*12 hours later*
Joseph and Alan came back with beer and vodka!Everyone got drunk, except me, who noticed I could actually walk straight and had some vague memory of what happened earlier!I tried to share my discovery, but everyone was in a drunken haze."Momma!""Whaat boy?""Look what I found out, momma-"
"Shut up and go get me a beer you dummy!"*in a hushed tone* "God he never shuts his trap"
After fetching her a drink, I figured I might as well join em.Fuck being sober, im a dwarf
