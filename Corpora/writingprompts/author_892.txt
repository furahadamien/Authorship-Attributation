-Took some liberties with the narrative-

I stopped being able to hear them a few weeks ago, but I know they're still out there.Even if they're all gone at this point, it's not worth it to look.The second that you step outside, you risk the Moment finding you.It's only been 3 months since the first Moment, but they've destroyed everything.I'm not sure what kind of world is waiting out there for me, but it doesn't matter.It won't be the same world tomorrow.It might not even be the same world right now as it just was a Moment ago.Before any of this, I used to be a College student.Really though, the degree was just to get my dad off my back.He was a buidling contractor, and wanted me to take over the family business.I've been swinging a hammer since I was 2, and know the business inside and out.. well, I guess I knew the business.Whichever way, a slip of paper wouldn't have made a difference.Being a 6 hour drive away from my family?That's a big difference considering how the world can change in a Moment.Granted, we didn't realize that when they first started happening.The first few Moments went almost unnoticed because of how small of an impact they had.The first Moment we know of was a homeless man in Seattle who was recorded on a security camera disappearing off the sidewalk at 3:05 PM, and being found dead 2 miles away.. also at 3:05 PM.The security camera footage wasn't found until a few days later, when the police were looking for a robbery suspect.The news broke that the first human teleportation had occurred, but had gone awry.Poor guy probably was already on his way out, and couldn't even use his Moment.The next known Moment was only a few hours later in Japan, where a child was found starved to death while her mother was in the bathroom.The mother reported that her daughter was 'fat and happy' before she went into the bathroom.The door shook once, and at the same time, she thought she heard something coming from the kitchen.It wasn't until she opened the door that she saw her home had been destroyed from the waist down.I still can't get the image of tiny fingernail marks on the bathroom door out of my head.Those were the nice ones.Within a few days, we started seeing the true nature of these Moments.Each Moment was a person who escaped time and had the power to do whatever they wanted.The only cost to them was their life.Whole towns of people would suddenly collapse, their throats simultaneously slit.All the joggers on a single trail would have their achilles tendons slit mid-run.Hospitals would suddenly have live grenades in every room.The people responsible were always nearby, usually with some sort of note or calling card of their 'achievements'."HEY BITCH, REMEMBER ME?I WAS THE ONE WHO YOU CUT OFF IN TRAFFIC THIS MORNING.SINCE YOU WENT AHEAD OF ME, I TOOK A HEAD OF YOUR HUSBAND."It's not even clever wordplay.The thing is, they had to leave notes.Once you use your Moment, that's it.No one has survived using one, and no one nearby survives anymore either, but for different reasons.See, once the Moments started happening, a lot of food suddenly started going missing.It turns out that while living in your Moment, you still have to eat, sleep, and shit just as much.Can you imagine having your pantry replaced with literal shit in the blink of an eye?Adding more locks, or more bars to your windows didn't help either.How can you stop someone who has already stopped time?It felt like nothing was impossible for them.The only real way to escape it is to use your Moment, and do the same to others.So many people either saw an opportunity for power, or an opportunity for escape that in a single afternoon, 99% of the world's population of animals (including humans) were died.I'm only still here because of my dad.Spring break was a week before this all started, and dad surprised me with one of the reasons he wanted me to go to his old school.He built this bunker with one of his college buddies when he was my age.It's a ways off campus in the woods with a hidden entrance.He told me that it was our little secret, and that it would be mine when he dies.We worked all week on repairs and restocking the place.We just added 6 months of non-perishable food, an old black and white TV, and ton of books.I was so excited to share this experience with my dad, I came back every day even after he left.I don't really want to think about if I hadn't decided I was too tired to go home after being here installing new shelves.Fucking shelves.I know it's crazy, but maybe there are more good people with just enough dumb luck holed up like me somehow.Maybe if I can just stretch out my rations long enough, I can wait this out.I have to.I haven't heard any explosions, or anything over the radio or on TV for a few weeks, so maybe no one else can use their Moments.Maybe no one else WANTS to use their Moment.Maybe then, I can help the world start over.Someone has to keep time moving forward.I just hope I can make this food last that long.Someone has to be there whe
