The time stops.The first time it had happened was months ago, and only for a few shocking seconds.I remember being afraid I'd had a stroke or something, but I never got it checked out.How do you tell a doctor that one second you're eating lunch and then nothing moves but you?The second time was maybe five minutes.I panicked when it started, but once I realized I was in control of myself and didn't seem like anything was wrong, it started seeming less terrifying.I admit, I did a few things I shouldn't have.Took advantage of the situation.A few dropped pants and tied shoes, nothing worse than that.Not like I could do anything more elaborate anyway, since I never knew when the time stops were coming or how long they'd last.I knew somehow instinctively that I wasn't making time stop.Once I figured that out, I felt a little disappointed, but it didn't bother me ultimately.Whoever it was didn't do a time stop very often, and they didn't manage to get me when the time was wrong, so it didn't bother me much.That is, until today.Or would it be more accurate to say three "days" ago?The time stops started picking up frequency over the last few weeks.Once a day, then twice a day, sometimes three or four.Fifteen minute stretches, thirty minutes.The longest one was about three hours.Inconvenient at best and downright boring at worst.It was always in the back of my head that I should find out who was doing this and give them a talking-to.Did they know whatever they were doing didn't affect me?Were they playing a prank on me or something?But every time I'd gotten to the point where I was just fed up enough to try, time would pop back into reality and I'd eventually forget the frustration.Except for this one.After six hours had stretched on with no end in sight, I decided it was time to make good on my threats.It took a bit of calming down and being focused, but I finally felt an odd feeling, like a compass needle pointing me in a direction.Since time hadn't returned, I followed it.Not like I have anything better to do.I was on day three when I found the room.A woman lay in a hospital bed, tubes sprouting from seemingly everywhere around her.To her right, a doctor stood, his hand poised over a silent machine.And to her left, a man sat in an uncomfortable-looking chair.His right hand rested on the woman's forehead, gently brushing her hair from her face with his thumb.His left hand's fingers intertwined with hers, their gold rings tapping against each other.And his head was downturned, staring at the floor,  until the sound of my footsteps made one haggard eye raise up over his outstretched left arm.We looked at each other in silence for a moment, then he looked away, his hand resuming stroking her hair.He looked like shit.Like he'd been crying for three days straight.I stood still for a moment, then simply brought a chair from another room and sat down quietly next to him.He didn't acknowledge me.I could see his chest heaving again with silent, pained sobs.And time stretched on.-------------------------------------------

First time posting here.Prompt lodged a scene in my head and I knew better than to ignore it.Just wrote it and did barely any editing before posting, so please be kind to me!I haven't written anything more or less since my degree burned away all my desire to write, lol.
