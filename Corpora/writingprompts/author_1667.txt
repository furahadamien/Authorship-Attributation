The demon lets out a sigh, "why does this keep happening"

I continue to flip through the cook book as fast as i can looking for anything that may help me rid the kitchen of the demon that stands before me.The demon eyes me up and down and asks "What are you doing?"I stare back unsure how to respond to what is standing before me."ENOUGH OF THIS FOOLISHNESS" The demon roars.The Demon grabs me and I know this is the end....He summons a bowl of chicken soup and disappears before me.I put grandma's cookbook down to never touch it again.. or would I ?
