There must be some kind of irony to the quiet and pleasant nature of my after life comparing it to the circumstances that led to my death.Being with the kid wasn't so bad, albeit it has been twenty minutes since I "woke up".Tea parties weren't exactly my thing, but with the alternative in mind I could get used to this.Or maybe I was speaking too soon, it could get boring.But boring was fine.I expected flames and giant forks, and for some reason god saw fit to not give me that.It was strange, and that was an understatement.In life, I had been a little bit more than a muscle for some drug dealer which name had been Dave, who wanted a strong, asiatic looking dude for bodyguard, with hands stained so bad with blood people could smell the iron if they were close enough.It hit me that Dave is probably dead too, the damn bastard, and I hoped he got something like this.The kid put a cup in front of me and to her credit the cup was actually full with tea.Could have faked that part; she was already talking with someone who wasn't actually all there, save the effort.The sight would have made me take a sip were I alive, if only to taste, but I realized I didn't feel any urge to do so.A plus, really.It would be kind of horrible in the long run if I started to feel thirsty or hungry.Nevertheless i tried to grab the cup, to not vail.All in all, everything was okay, I guess."You're so weird, Sir Fluffles" The girl said "You look funny with those holes in your belly.and you need a shower, your fur looks dirty again"

Ah, and I was a bunny.A pink bunny, with bullet holes in the stomach."M'lady" I said, while tipping my fedora "The tea is very good, but I do not wish to shower.My fur will get dirty anyway"

"Nu-uh!You can't say no!All of the members of my court need to be fluky presentable!"Fluky?Alright.Nonsense, really, but nonsense was what I needed.It was logical that they were going to attack us that night, and yet we were so confident.We didn't have the firepower to deal we them, nor the men, but we thought that since we were "protected" by another drug dealer with more name and reputation than most we didn't have to be worried about such things.We were going to be just fine.Nobody would dare touch us.And I die all the same.They made me beg and I begged, and even in that moment it was obvious they were going to shoot me.Shit.They probably shot Dave.Dave was my friend."Fuck"

"Fuck?"The kid said, alarming me.I soon came back to my senses, to where I was."No, I mean- FLUK.Yes, fluk.thats what I said"

"No" She responded " You said fuck.Fuck's a bad word"

I grimaced "It is"

"Don't be saying that again, Sir Fluffes.I won't tolerated more bad words in my court"

I looked at her for a moment.She wasn't older than six, maybe seven if I pushed it.A smiled a little, trying to look admonished and failing to do so "alright"

She smiled and then proceded to talk to the other animals, more real than me.This was nonsense.My very existence was nonsense.I think even before I die it was, for I was a man who feared god and yet everything a did in life was bad.This, on the other hand was good.Still nonsense, but nonsense was what I needed.A little quiet for a little while."Whats your name, kid?"She turned at me, appearing a little weirded out.I guessed her imaginary friends don't tend to speak out of turn.But still, she answered, curious "Lilly"
