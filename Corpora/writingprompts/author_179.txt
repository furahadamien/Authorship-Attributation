The obnoxious noise of that unmistakable emergency tone startled me awake.For a minute, the blur in my eyes was too great to make out what was on the screen.A flash flood warning?An AMBER alert?Eventually, I could see clearly as the brightness of my phone no longer blinded me.The message read, DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON.Im not sure why, but that message instantly gave me goosebumps.What could possibly be so bad about the moon that an official warning was sent out?But I brushed off the sinking feeling in my stomach, and told myself it must be something like an eclipse.I was no expert on all the things our moon does.And yet, as I pressed the home button, the message icon popped up showing hundreds of texts.Once again I tried rationalizing something that could not be rationalized.I assumed my group chat had gone wild after Id went to bed.I opened the message app to find one single text from all different numbers.They all said, Its a beautiful night tonight.Look outside. I scrolled through every number noticing they were all random.None of my own contacts had messaged me.At that point, I was finally alert.I sat up in bed, only to have a horrible realization.I was right next to my open window.Im not sure how to describe the feeling I had, but a part of it was definitely panic.Only looking through the corners of my eyes I grabbed the top of the window and pushed it down.Without even half of a second going by I pulled on my bunched up curtain and covered the whole window.Thats when I heard it.A deep sound rumbling through the humid night air.There was no discernible pattern or verbal enunciation in it.Just the bass vibrating through my ears.Unsure of what to do, I tried searching through Twitter for anymore insight into what was happening.But the WiFi was down and my phone had no data connection.My only plan was to try to go back to sleep, or at least stay in my bed until morning.Suddenly, the noise came back, but this time it pierced my ears.I tried to cover them to no avail.I forced my body out of bed and walked through the house, all the while grasping at my head as the noise droned on.I couldnt even muffle it with my hands.And then it stopped.I took my hands off my ears.They were red and sore.Either from the noise itself or from pushing on them as hard as I could.Probably both.I felt my chest as my heart beat like a hummingbirds wings.I took fast, shallow breaths until I calmed down.I stood there in my living room for just about 3 minutes, but what felt like forever.Until a faint tapping turned my attention to the sliding glass door.I closed my eyes and stopped breathing, too afraid to look for the source, yet knowing whoever, or whatever, it was could see me anyway.I mustered up the courage to open my eyes.I slowly turned, dragging my eyes across the ground so I wouldnt have to see it until the very last moment.My eyes came up and peered into the night.A  dark silhouette of a woman stood outside.She looked normal enough, until my eyes met with hers.They were grey.The same matte, invariable grey color the moon has.I stood frozen in fear.Stupid, I know.I never wanted to be one of those people.I told myself Id act on it if something like that ever happened to me.Apparently, I was wrong.The tapping continued.One arm was raised, as a single finger tapped on the glass.The rest of her body wasnt moving, and she didnt take her eyes off me for a second.Abruptly, her voice floated through the air.Its a beautiful night tonight.Look outside.I was expecting anything besides the very normal voice I heard.She wasnt a demon.Or a ghost.Or something else.No, she was human.A human being whos eyes were filled in with grey.A human being who kept tapping on my door.The small amount of glow coming from the porch light I kept on outside just barely illuminated her face.Her expression was that of curiosity.As if she wanted me to discover the moon with her.But I *wasnt* stupid.I knew what I had to do.I walked over to the blinds and tugged on them.They were the kind you had to move yourself, no fancy pully system.And as I walked them over to cover her, I stopped directly in front of her face.Those goddamn eyes.Like a siren song, beckoning me to open the door and look outside.No, I wouldnt.Fuck you I said.And I covered the door the rest of the way.Somehow, I found a way to fall asleep.When I awoke in the morning, I experienced that brief moment when youre just waking up and dont remember anything thats happening, but only for a second.I bolted upright, memories of the night running through my head.I opened my phone and saw another emergency broadcast, one that hadnt been able to wake me.It only said, Thank you.

I got up and walked past my glass door, too anxious to check if the woman was still there.I had an irrational goal of feeling the sunlight, as if I hadnt felt it everyday before that.I swung open my front door.The world was drowned in a deep, gloomy red color.And on the ground were bodies.Dead bodies turned up at the sky.The corpses of my neighbors and their kids, a few pets, even a baby.But worst of all, every single body was missing the eyes.And now, Im standing here.Staring out at the people collapsed on their lawns, pointed upward.And I cant help myself.I turn my own eyes up and look into the sky.The sun is gone.Only a blood red moon is above me.But for some reason, my vision is slowly giving out.Its like my eyes are being glossed over.And the only thing I can think to say is, Its a beautiful day today.Look outside.
