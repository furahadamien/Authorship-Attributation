"The borders will open soon.""Mm.""I wonder how they will feel?""One can only imagine.We're ready regardless.""We've been spying on them for so long.Observing how they think, how they feel...yet, no amount of data can predict this.""Mm.""A nation, alone.Sure, multi-ethnic, of many origins...but most have lost touch with their roots.""Melted into a nice little pot.""...How many hours left?""Three.You're tense.""How couldn't I be?The greatest lie in history is about to end.""Debatable.The lie they told themselves when the war began, think that's the bigger one.""...I'm not sure what I'm questioning more, the ethics that this lie was founded on, or the ethics of ending it.""It wasn't born from ethics.Only necessity and survival.As for ending it...well, every bandage has to get taken off, regardless of how ugly the scar is.""...They're afraid.Afraid and hopeful.""I figured.At least we'll have that in common.""...I'm afraid.Afraid and...hopeful.""Good.It'd be worrying if you weren't.""What about you?How do you feel?""Calm?Zen?Tired?Everything?Nothing?Ah hell, after everything?All I figure is that the world is just gonna keep on spinning.Life goes on and all that jazz, war or no war.I don't know how, they don't know how, we don't know how...just will.And honestly?I think they know that to."
