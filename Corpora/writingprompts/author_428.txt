It all started in the middle of a Nuclear Disarmament conference, they had started to finally believe that both North Korea and Iran were being honest about dismantling their nuclear and ICBM ambitions, man, were they wrong.They just wanted to catch us off guard, they both launched missiles simultaneously, Iran targeted Jerusalem and Riyadh, while the PRK aimed for Okinawa and Tokyo, there may have been other targets, many facts have been lost to history, but those are the places that did get hit, Luckily there were some vigilant soldiers who got the missile defenses booted up in time to prevent any other missiles from hitting their targets.They managed to get just enough of a handle on things to keep anyone else from using nukes, but as far as peace, there was little chance, as soon as we had missiles headed back in retaliation China's Navy started attacking anything with a U.S.Flag that they saw, and in the meantime, they started smuggling carriers of engineered biological weapons into the U.S. through both Mexico and Canada, which also took a large toll on the populations in those countries, and spurred a panic that led to large scale infections in all First world, and many developing counties.Russia withdrew into itself, attacking anyone who got close, but never venturing out looking for a fight, but they'd been fooled as well, and knew that getting into a drawn out war would hurt them more than it would ever help, they'd just liked the idea of backing Iran as a deterrent to further U.S.Intervention in the middle east, they too were badly affected by the plague that was spreading... 

Iran imploded after they launched their missiles, the population decided that they'd rather fight and die than let their government take them all the way down the path to ruin, Sadly though, the Mullahs had already fulfilled their promise to wipe Israel off the map.And what was left of the IDF was to busy treating wounded, regardless of heritage, and trying to protect what was left of their people from revitalized Hamas and Hezzbollah terrorists to even consider retaliating anyway.Saudi Arabia, deprived of it's seat of power, and Royal Family, Collapsed in on itself as well, as local Chieftains cropped up and tried to impose their own particular brand of Sharia law onto anyone within their sphere of influence.And such was the case throughout the rest of the middle east as well, being as the powers that had been there to keep them united, whether in support of or opposition to, were all either gone or too busy elsewhere to bother.North Korea, naturally started pushing south, they made headway due to the large number of their forces, but were doomed to fail from the beginning, they did however, manage to cut the population of South Korea in half, mostly due to targeting the large urban centers.One thing that large scale wars always do is show you where people's true loyalties lie, most of Europe violated their NATO obligations, and decided to sit it out.Japan on the other hand, gave their all to the fight, but were soon overwhelmed being as their military may have been advanced and skilled, it was small in number due to their declining population.As soon as we started making a decent push back against the Chinese, the U.N. Decided to step in against the U.S. of course, they tried to assign all blame for the War on the U.S., solely because we had been the only Superpower and if we had just done this or that differently We could have prevented it, the vote was nearly unanimous.Our few Allies were by that point too afraid to go against the majority, and we were too fed up with dealing with them that we chose to not even bother using our Security Council Veto... Well, it was decided after that that all countries would take a 50 year break from each other, and we'd meet back up after that time to see if we should go back to business as normal, or just resume our isolation.As I'm sure everyone knows by now, that 50 years is almost up, and while we've maintained our physical and 2 way communication isolation, we have been keeping a as close an eye on the outside world as we could.Naturally, the other countries that in good faith pledged to stay isolated, didn't, most tried, but being as the U.S. Was sidelined, and actually keeping it's side of the bargain, certain world forces rose up to fill the vacuum of power, namely, The Islamic Caliphate, it started as many disparate bands in many countries throughout the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Asia and even Australia, there was no one left with the will to fight back, they transcended Race, they would accept anyone who was willing to convert and pickup arms on their behalf, their culture is death and destruction, taking whoever and whatever they wanted, while claiming it was in service to their god, rape and pillage is a strong recruitment tool in a world where everything is in ruins and there is very little government with a will to even attempt fighting back.They all took over the majority of the world in 30 years, and now it appears they are starting to join forces and look toward our shores... 

Luckily for us, we had a culture of our own that was regaining steam as well, it too transcended race, but not only race, religion as well (Granted, Islam is at it's very core Authoritarian, so they weren't included), it was a culture of Liberty, but not without a mind for staying prepared against outside threats,.We rebuilt, we innovated, developed new technologies, geared to both raising our standard of living and defense, each borrowing from the other as necessary, we borrowed from Switzerland the idea of training and arming our entire population, and this started even before we realized fully what was happening in the world around us.Now we are at the point that we have 2 options, either venture out into the world to confront this imminent threat and free the oppressed who have refused to convert, or abandon it all together and head towards The Stars, in hopes of finding a new home where we can be free of Authoritarianism.A few even think there may be a third option, send out the ships, but have others remain to try a salvage this world, but very few think it's worth it...
