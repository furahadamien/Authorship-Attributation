I held the book,  
Felt its weight.Hefted it,  
Like a lodestone on my future.I looked near the beginning,  
Where the jumps were large,  
The changes so drastic,  
The choices heavy.I turned to the back,  
It read like a novel,  
Each decision short,  
Small,  
Meaningless.Ah, the old maxim was true,  
With age all choices grow small,  
And a man can choose,  
Only what he must.I closed the book.It was taken from me,  
Freed from the questions,  
Uncaring of the answers,  
I continued to walk.
