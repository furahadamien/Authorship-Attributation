I'm a bit of an oddity.People have always been intimidated by me, but I've grown accustomed to the stares and hesitant fear.My father told me that mom ran out on him because I was too ugly of a baby.Bouncer was the perfect job for me.I'm 6'9", I weigh 360lbs, I can bench press 400 and I wear DD bra and the matching panties.Cause I'm a woman.Duh.I never wanted to be burly.I've always wanted to be slim, but I just ain't, and no amount of starvation diet or exercise has ever even lost me 5lbs.And I see people's ages above their heads in glowing green digits.Not that big a deal though.It gets me in trouble more often than not.Other women recognize the disbelief on my face when they lie about their age.Their casual resentment and catty comment are not fun to take.But I'm an excellent bouncer at "The Teximerican" in northern Nova Scotia.I'll just jump right into it.It was a normal night until HE showed up.He was gorgeous.Don't get me wrong, I'm not one to fawn over handsome men, or women for that matter.But this dude had the stuff of every omnisexual's dreams.He just handed me his ID like there was nothing in the world odd about him.Okay, no one else would've seen the green "4321" number above his head, but still!"What the fu-" I stopped myself - I'm not allowed to swear on the job."How the f- ... How old are you?!"He just looked confused and glanced at the ceiling above my head, "Can't you read?"He asked as he took in my gaze."Your ID says..." I hadn't actually looked at it yet, but after I did, "21.""No no no," he said, "the number over my head, dummy!"He grabbed his ID from my hand and strolled past me while I stared in shock.The next person in line handed me her card.I barely even noticed her fishnet unconcealed thighs.Not knowing what to do, I just went through the motions.All the while, my mind was racing with thoughts of the mysterious man, oh shit!What was his name?!?FffUUUU

{Screw it,} I thought, {this job can suck it.}I ignored the 2 people in line and left my post and my uniform hat behind me while I went looking for the man.He wasn't too hard to spot in a crowd of double digits.I tried to corner him but he saw me coming and waved at me with a big grin on his face.I was worried I might scare him off, so I smiled back and went over casually the rest of the way.He looked me up and down with a twinkle in his eye that I didn't understand as he greeted me, "Hey, babe, how's life?""I don't even know where to begin, how did-"

"Sorry to interrupt, but if I may?"he rudely interrupted.I rolled my eyes, "Go ahead then!""How did I decide to spend my birthday here of all places, right?I mean, this place is just so freakishly backward and out-of-the-way.""Seriously!?That's what you guessed I wanted to know?""Well yeah," he was crestfallen."How the f- ... How did you know about the numbers I see and how are you over 4000 years old!?""Seriously?That's what you wanted to know?"We stared blankly at each other for a moment.Suddenly his eyes lit up as he snapped his fingers and smiled, "You don't know how I am this old do you?!"My eyes popped and jaw dropped, "Duh!""Right."He suddenly looked very sorry for me, "We'd better go back to my place.""Hey!I don't know what you're thinking but I'm not looking for a pity fu-"

"No no no," he interrupted AGAIN, "just come and you'll see."Well what was I supposed to do?He was smaller than me anyway, so I could take him if I had to.We walked out into the alley and suddenly the town blurred as it zoomed away below us just before I blacked out.Let me save us some time here.I have to get to work soon but I just wanted to get this out there before my first shift as developing culture bouncer.I woke up to find myself in a space faring vessel.A UF effing O.He's an alien, but as it turns out, so am I.My mom didn't run out on me and my father, she was called away on a spy mission or something and was KIA.I want to know more, but that's all I've had the fortitude to hear so far.Jason, my Ship's body guard drone, tells me I have a lot to learn.His avatar is fun to play with, but we both have work to do at the moment.Hopefully the smatter outbreak will go unnoticed by the people below.-a fanfic of the Iain M. Banks' The Culture series
