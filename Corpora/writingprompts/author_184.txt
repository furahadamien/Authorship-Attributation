Shinji paced his hotel room, brow furrowed in thought.The International Ninja Cup was a mere day away, and as his feet padded softly on the back and forth on the floor his mind was furiously at work.As Team Captain, he was given a tremendous opportunity - to lead Team Japan against clans from across the globe.But, he bore a heavy weight - it was his responsibility to attempt to redeem Japan after years of shame.Hundreds of years of competition, and each and every result the same - Japan disgracing itself with a last place finish.No matter the advancements in technology, no matter the focus on personal discipline, Japan could not seem to produce ninjas with the skill and talent of other nations.A soft sigh escaped Shinji's lips as he shook his head for the hundredth time - he must not let his focus slip for even an instant.He must keep his mind sharp, lest one small error lead to his team's downfall.He stepped to the window to take in the beautiful morning view, a small smile crossing his face; yes, as long as he could maintain precise concentration, he would lead Japan out of last place for the first time in recorded history.He was sure of it.He turned away to recheck his equipment one more time when a sizzling blur scythed the air beside his head.A shuriken embedded itself with a thud into the wall two inches beside his head, shattering his concentration and sending adrenaline coursing through his veins.He leapt to the window, pulling a dagger from his belt, ready to defend himself from this obvious attempt to sabotage his team.However, as his eyes scanned the rooftops and skyline surrounding his hotel room, he could not see any trace of his attacker.He easily spotted Toshi, who was on guard duty.Using ninja hand signals he asked the master ninja if he had seen the failed assassin, but Toshi indicated that he hadn't even noticed the attack.Enraged, Shinji flew to the wall where the weapon had lodged itself.Prying it loose he noted the 9-pointed maple leaf of its shape, identifying itself undeniably as the work of the Canada Clan.But, for the first time he also noticed the attached note.Retrieving it, he read the words slowly to himself, cheeks reddening as he did."Hello Shinji.Hope all is well.Sorry to bother you, but we are trying to get ready for the big competition tomorrow, and we were wondering if you wouldn't mind keeping down the noise?Between you stomping around your room and blustering loudly to yourself, we're finding it real hard to get anything done.Thanks a lot, and good luck tomorrow eh?"
