$86,000 Going on Broke
By T. Roller

Last month in New York, a 54 year old man lost everything in the desperate attempt to discover the fate of $10 that was unaccounted for when he checked his bank balance at the beginning of the month.In an attempt to discover the origin of this debit  the man promptly called his bank.After being on hold for 43 minutes he thankfully found out that it was simply an error and the money was restored to the account.However 3 weeks later upon receiving his phone bill, the 54 year old discovered his phone bill to be $85,367.
