"You see this, necklace right here?Pure gold.Forged by the Archons themselves following their defeat at the Shattered Summit."I dangled the item in front of him.His eyes tracked it, swaying back and forth for a moment before snapping back into focus with mine."I don't care if the fantastical wizard-beards of wonderfell crafted it in the cavernous catacombs of catastrophe," He said flatly,"Do you even know the exchange rate for gold is these days?""Well, no, I do not."I said through gritted teeth, "Time traveling tends to leave one a bit out of the loop.Now, will.you.please.let.me.out?""What time traveler chooses a prison cell as their destination?"He waved a hand."Besides, even if I did, I'd have to throw you right back in.You've admitted to time travel, it's a violation of the laws of causality, you know.""No!No, shut up!I traveled here from the past.I am from the past, I could not have influenced causality any more than some schmuck of a prison guard who doesn't know the value of one of the Outer Serpentine amulets of Ygdrosith.""Ah, but you think of time too linearly, my delusional friend.Time is merely a construct by which we come to terms with life.It might help to think of time as a picket fence, rather than as a" 

"Hey, Joachim, I'm taking next shift.The Stepped Palace has a sale on some killer loafers, might help to ease the loss of that pair you ruined stomping that on bloke the other day.""Seriously?Just my luck that a new pair of loafers comes on sale, and I have to spend all my savings on ransom money."He turned to me, "I really enjoyed this talk.We should do it again sometime."He walked off, and another figure, identical to the last in all but height, took his place.Thick silence filled the cramped white cell.I wrapped my cloak tightly around myself.Backwards or forwards.Backwards, and the world would finely see the great thief Obertach hanging limply from the end of a noose.Forwards, and Obertach's corpse would instead hang from the tendrils of a particularly nasty Ygdrosith, awakened from a 1,000 year slumber and looking for a way to abet a centuries old coffee headache.The guard coughed; I kept my eyes pointed forward.I was in no mood for idle banter.Another fit of coughs, more pronounced and dramatic.My eyes stayed glued to the walls.A few more coughs and the guard sighed, and turned, shoulders slumped."No?Nothing?"he said, resting his arm atop the curtain of metal bars."What happened to, all that 'I shall never forget you so long as I live' business?Or how about the 'we shall meet again one hundred years hence'."With a sigh, I rolled my head to look at him.It took him a minute, but eventually it dawned on him that a solid five inches of plate armor lay between me and even a morsel of recognizably.A few taps on a glowing rectangle  on his arm later, and the helmet folded back to reveal a familiar face."Fuck.""Nice to see you too" 

He leapt back a moment before my dagger thrust though the space where his neck had been.Before I could withdraw, his hand grasped mine in an iron grip, and with a twist my dagger fell clattering to the floor."Good of you to show up, friend of mine," My hand burned "The cell's a bit too white for my tastes; I was thinking of redecorating.How's red sound?"With some effort, I stomped on my fallen weapon, sending it whirling through the air.My hand had barely found its hilt before a blade lay flat across my throat, a thin trickle of scarlet running down its polished steel."You look pretty good for someone in their second century, Jin."I tried to pull away, but his grip was as unfaltering as the grin that stretched across that stuck up face of his."They reward betrayal with immortality now, do they?""Eleventh Century, and betrayal is the wrong word for it.Aiding a criminal wanted across all four realms in countless timelines, is a bit closer."His grin grew wider still "Or do you think the cloak of time just up and walked itself out of the Council's vault."Dammit.There were wore things than being in debt to Jin the Undying, but most of those things had died close to a millennium ago or could, in fact, die.
