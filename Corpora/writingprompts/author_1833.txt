They told me I was lucky.My whole life they said that the stat assessment showed I was one of the luckiest people alive with a score of 100.I swore it wasnt true.If I had been lucky, why was I born to a poor family?I never got to play games of chance, since those were forbidden to luck score 100s.Then the revolution happened.The leaders swore they would prove that people controlled their own destiny, that luck had nothing to do with success, and, as proof, they would throw the 100s in prison as an ultimate sign of human triumph over the odds.Having a lower rating began to be a mark of pride, an inspiration.Some of us tried to run and hide.Thats what I did.I managed to hide a while, too.It was, ironically, just bad luck that they caught me.The guy whose identity I was usings brother happened to be a member of the Luck Police, and he was visiting relatives across the country the day he caught sight of my fake name on the ID I gave the clerk at a convenience store.I couldnt have lasted much longer, anyway.They had just created the AR rig that let you see peoples stats just by looking at them.None of our underground community knew how to fool it.It updated in real time.So, off to prison I went.With all of the other lucky ones.Thats when I met Eddie.Most of us, at this point, had our ideas about the system.Most of us thought it was complete bullshit, created so that the people in control could make an enemy to unite people around.Eddie, though, he had a different idea.He swore that it was real.He said he had been a scientist and had helped develop the measurement system, and swears they had gotten it right, but it was hard to argue with the evidence.All the luckiest people wind up in prison, so how are we lucky again?Even locked up as one of us Eddie swore it was true.Even talked about how coming across the measurement at all was a lucky break.He had been studying DNA for a marker for gambling addiction, when he found the luck gene.Eddie was right.I still remember hearing the whispers.Carl was a 96 now.The AR rig swore it.I was with Eddie when we saw Carl, and through the rig, we could see it too.Right beside him: Luck - 96.It was an odd color, though.It was green, not white like normal.I asked Eddie about it.He frowned.We had theorized that there were things that could give a temporary boost or penalty.Luck clovers, breaking mirrors, and things.I guess the research on those is complete, and they programmed them into the rig?

I looked at Carl and there, behind his ear, I saw it.A four leaf clover.But those were supposed to be...I saw the look of horror on Eddies eyes as he did the same calculations I was doing.The green luck boost.It moved his score down.Eddie shook his head and stared at his feet.The sons of bitches.They got it backwards.Its like a golf score.Lower is better.We are stuck in here because we are the most unlucky bastards on the planet.
