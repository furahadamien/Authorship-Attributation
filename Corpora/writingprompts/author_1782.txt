Dad?

So many emotions began brewing inside the boy the second he saw his old man walk through the door.He was only 11 years old when his dad, his protector, his best friend, left their family.The boy and his dad did everything together.They played catch, they played with action figures, anything, you name it.The boy did not have many friends in school, you see.He was picked on for being too short, for wearing glasses, for being a nerd.But him and his dad always had a special bond.Of course, the boy had a pretty good relationship with his mother and two sisters, but more so with his father.Thats what made his disappearance so hard to believe.For years, the boy wondered why.Why would his dad leave like this?One day, he told his family he needed more cigarettes, and then up and left.He never returned.The boys mother fell into a deep depression.His sisters were sad, too.But the boy felt the pain the most.Now, the same man who left all those years ago was back, claiming it had only been 30 minutes.The boy froze.He didnt know what to think.Dad?, he said again.Why do you look so confused, slugger?I was only gone for half an hour.

Tears began to pour down the boys face.He ran into the arms of his dad and hugged him, hugged him until he could hug no more.His surroundings dissolved as he embraced his fathers presence, and for a moment it felt as if his best friend never left.His mom was baking cookies in the kitchen, his sisters were playing dolls, and the boy and his father were playing catch in the backyard, just like back then.It was almost dreamlike.A nightmare, really.Nothing had changed.
