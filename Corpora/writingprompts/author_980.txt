Realizing he has struck gold Pennywise carefully prepared a large amount of stew base and got skewers and veggies ready.This is going to be the biggest turtle stew he has attempted.The rat kebabs will be a perfect appetizer and more than enough to go around.Bozo, Emmett Kelly, and Grock will be so impressed by this scrumptious feast they will not hesitate to let Pennywise be an instructor at the Guild of Fools and Joculators and College of Clowns, perhaps even allowing Captain Spaulding to be an assistant.All those years of finishing off that subconscious doctorate are going to pay off in a big way.
