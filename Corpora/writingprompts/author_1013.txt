As I walked into the dimly lit convenience store I stumbled around and grabbed the first sugary snack I could find, a sharp blue and black pack of original OREOs.I made a dash for a quart of milk and gave the good man my thumb print for payment.My feet carried me to my New York apartment when suddenly a splash of water soaked me.I saw the culprit, a self driving semi sprayed me with a puddle."I guess ai cant think of everything" I muttered aloud.I reached into my newly soaked pants and pulled out my apartment keys.I stripped and sat on a old brown recliner and opened up my tasty snack.But to my surprise a loud speaker turned on with a hologram of some guy in a suit."CONGRATULATIONS you are the sole winner of lifetime OREOs!OREO has teamed up with the Amazon Prime Portal Warehouse system for home use!you will have oreos appear from the portal box anytime you click this button!You are the first person to test the technology!Please consider other portal boxes from our SNACK, HOUSEHOLD, or AUTOMOTIVE sections, starting at $5000 per year!Dont worry we have a truly unlimited amount of consumer goods!"The hologram went dim.Inside the package was a wire mesh and a remote control with instructions."Place wire mesh on flat surface.Place in direct sunlight and push button."I pushed the button a wonderful amazon logo hologram appeared

"Thank you for choosing Amazon Prime Portals"

A small flash of blue and a smell of plastic and rubber and POOF a package of oreos.I leaned back with my oreos and turned on the TV "Wide spread calamity as an industrial amazon portal collapsed creating a tiny black hole which has destroyed the west coast.It has caused a tsunami in China and an earthquake in the midwest we may lose po---"

I opened up the bag and put an OREO in my mouth.It made a pleasant crunch.
