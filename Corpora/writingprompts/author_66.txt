"Mr.Bond?!I'm the President!I'm President Trump!"screamed an angry, obese man as he was being dragged down a hallway."I know.But I always thought it would be cool to say that," replied Elon Must in a snide yet humorous tone.Elon Musk continued walking down the hallway to the control room in the opposite direction.He couldn't wait to make the announcement to the world.How did we get here?Well, by now we all know we didn't just arrive at this moment overnight.Elon Musk was never known to be particularly vindictive or violent, but that Twitter war started by Donald "Cadet bonespurs" - oops, J.- Trump was pushed him over the edge.Opinion polls started to cover the public feud months ago, just as it seemed the Russia investigation was ready to charge Trump.By then, it had already heated up and had the public's attention.People were already on the street mobilized, protesting the "President" after he found a way to fire Mueller and stop the probe.Maybe Cadet Bonespurs (finally, a nickname stuck, thanks to Senator Duckworth) thought another fight on social media would draw press and conversation away from what he had done if he escalated the altercation with Elon.Nobody really knows what goes through the mind of a madman, though.When the marches started, fivethirtyeight.com had opinion polls tracking his approval rate at 23% and his disapproval rate at 73%.The numbers for the Trump-Elon bout were worse.And they continued to tank every day until this moment.Headlines were entirely in Elon's favor with titles such as "Musk Defends All Africans, Black and While Trump Pro-Apartheid Comments Ignite Rocket Fuel" - and they were becoming daily, when they weren't focused on impeachment or the Mueller firing.Americans were angry, apart from his racist base.Musk thought about everything Trump had done and said that led to this decision, to kidnap Trump and launch him into space on a one-way trip.He thought about the possible consequences and reactions over the past month as he customized this latest Space X rocket, fitted with 4k HD screens that would broadcast every second in every angle pre- during and post-launch.He was every bit as calculating as he had been and knew he was right, the last thing Cadet Bonespurs would ever hear would be applause from Earth.A smile crossed his face.He had relaxed while reliving these thoughts over the past 45 minutes while final preparations were made.The military, FBI and all other federal agencies didn't even attempt to breach Space X's property.Now he was ready to push the button.He opened communications with Cadet Bonespurs one more time, "Hey, make sure you wave to our employees on the moon and Mars when you pass by!Yes, they're already there.At least you got one thing right, but nobody will ever know!"This last remark sent Trump into a rage.But he was trapped.Opening broadcast communications required a hand size of at least 7.44 inches to be scanned.Alas, nobody could hear his screams.But he knew it was true!He knew it was a conspiracy!Except, it wasn't.It was just Elon Musk once again outmaneuvering Trump's tiny brain and tiny hands.He knew Trump would believe anything at this point.It took Elon another minute to contain himself and stop laughing.Tears welled up in his eyes as he watched the Cadet.Then he pushed the button."We have liftoff," messaged the control tower.All Trump could hear were cheers and applause.
