Door to door.I am so hungry, but I force a smile on my face."Hello, sorry to bother you this evening, but would you like to browse our catalogue?"I hold it open."Hm...they all say 'welcome,' don't you have any that have cutesy phrases?"They say back.I'm tempted to lie, to say we don't.I try nudging her to ones that say "please, come in," or other phrases of use to me, but there's no budging her, she wants one as a joke for her neighbor.Eventually, defeated, I accept her purchase of one "Ca$h me Inside" for $19.99."Could I measure your door?"I ask.It's a long shot, but I'm *so* hungry!"Oh, please, do come in!"Fucking *finally*!
