Fear struck my heart as I watched the great book descend towards me, falling with falling with both speed and force.I tried as hard as I could to dash out of the way, but I had noticed it too late.I prepared myself for the end.The boot froze, the giant pulling back his foot.He bent to the ground, gently pulling me into the skies.I let out a breath of relief as I saw where was taking me- back to the land of the sun.He let me to the ground gently, but before he returned to his cave, left me with a parting whisper."Today you, tomorrow me."I gave a small prayer of thanks to the giant.He had saved me from them.***

*Seven Years Later*

"Matt!"My dad yelled from the other room."Go take the trash out."I sighed loudly, heading into the garage to look for the bags.I found them piled up in the corner, smelling much worse than I had expected.I heaved the first one onto my shoulder, it filled with metal trash and was rather heavy, opened the garage door, and headed towards the dumpster.With a small grunt, I heaved the large bag into the bin.It landed with a resounding clang.*That was odd.* I thought.*Wasn't today Thursday?Shouldn't there be more trash?* Normally the bags of uneaten food would pad the ground.I shrugged it off, moving to pick up my family's bags of left over lunches and dinners.The bag was far lighter than expected, so when I picked it up, the motion caused the bag to rip.A few maggots flew out of the bag, one landing on my foot.I jerked back, giving out a small scream as I scrambled to turn on the lights.My fumbling hands finally founds the switch, and as I went back to inspect the bag, I found that there was *no food* left, only a few maggots.The maggots were dead, small bite sized marks leaving most of them completely disfigured.I screamed again in shock, stepping back to look at the garage as a hole.That's when I noticed it.There was a hole in the garage, the size of a soccer ball, that seemed to have been chewed into by something...I stood frozen with a mixture of fear and awe as I wondered how it could have happened.As I stood watching, a few small rays of light began to appear at the end of the tunnel, making me realize two things.Whatever created that hole was still there, and going inside the house.The only room with a light on was Luke's.My two year old brother.***
