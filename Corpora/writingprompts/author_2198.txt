"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 8" George read aloud, as he opened a new notebook.Never had his writing been so productive.Never had he got through so much in so little time.He had stopped blogging, stopped even accepting invitations to the vast multitude of events he was normally bought lunch at.He had even stopped occasionally rearranging his notes on *Winds of Winter*.What a project he had found!JK Rowling, bless her soul, had died at the perfect moment.Her stories, so thrilling for younger audiences, were now ready to graduate to a new level.In this, George R. R. Martin faced an idea with the most writing potential perhaps anybody in the long history of the written word had ever come across - he was sure of it!His name would sit alongside Shakespeare, or Homer, or... well.. JK Rowling!The essential beauty of books 1-6 (which he would rename 'The Book of Hogwarts'), was that the themes and writing grew up as the readers did.Beginning your first year of secondary school, you might be overjoyed to read a book about a boy on a similar journey, only he has just found out he is (a) magic, and (b) the centre of the universe.After all, everyone that age believes they are the centre of the universe, and wishes they were magic.And by the sixth year of secondary school, the poor bastards are worn out.A 3rd consecutive year of "the most important exams of your lives", the black dog of depression, onset by the imminent prospect of failing to achieve anything in life, and the ongoing stumbles and misery of puberty - and the worry and shock that inevitably follows any actual success in puberty.The death of Albus Dumbledore must've clawed at the same engines of angst of the teenage brain, as say, receiving the results of your mock Mechanics exam and getting a few grades lower than your overbearing parents have demanded as a minimum, or realising in sex ed.that you probably should've taken precautions that actually work last week.Which is why George had didn't understand the intention that the Deathly Hallows should be the last book.After all, the struggle against the tide of shit that begins at age 11, doesn't stop at 18!He knew that!Why, it's barely started!No-one kills their own personal Voldemort at that age.Now, perhaps, their own personal Voldemort might get the better of them, and, err, kill them, but that didn't seem to be a fitting end to Harry Potter's story (at least, not at the age of 18).But now the story wasn't just about Harry, it was about Wizarding Britain.JK's completed chapters made that clear.Sure, her illustration of the trials of society was a bit lazy, but a good transition.The three basic themes were there: The workings of the Dark Ministry, the re-degradation of a postwar society clinging to an imagined redemption (that it hasn't really completed), and the crippling reconstitution of that society for so many who now find themselves to be 'undesirables' on the run.To kill the main character, and end the narrative there, would be to abandon the Wizarding world to a fall into fascism in which the vast majority of them would be willing accomplices.George couldn't let that happen - for the sake of the very readers he was now responsible for.And he couldn't kill the main villain, either, as that was just preposterous.He could spin a good yarn, but George couldn't work miracles, and only a miracle was going to stop the Dark Lord now.However many horcruxes he had left, George was sure he would now deposit them in entirely random places around the globe, deep within protective confines.As George read the character, there was a silly tendency toward sentiment there (hence the locations of the discovered and destroyed horcruxes), but living for a decade as a pile of mush in Albania would've taught him not to make that mistake again.So then, Hogwarts must be destroyed, and most of the Weasleys too.That much was certain.End of Part I, so beings The Book of the Dark Ministry.That had been 12 hours ago.He had been informed of the will's contents 4 days ago, and immediately he had dropped what he was doing (a prototype hand-knit map of Westeros for each copy of *Winds*).A niggling technicality stated only that he would complete Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and this had plagued him as he filled manuscript after manuscript at a rate he hadn't achieved since *Clash of Kings*.He must convince the publishers to extend the Deathly Hallows to a 12-part series, divided itself into the Book of the Dark Ministry and the Book of the Light.To sell the concept, he needed to have some form of rough draft as far advanced as he could before the meeting in the morning - sorry, the funeral in the morning.He would be attending with some of the publishers, as a gesture to fans who would now be desperate for any clue as to his intentions with the series.--Deathly Hallows Part 8: The Book of Light II: The Deathly Detour --

*It was Harry's 24th birthday, he thought, as he awoke in the underbelly of the fishing trawler.Another day of hard work for the Beggar who Lived, in this muggle exile.An owl had come in the night, the contents of its note so obviously faked as to confirm his suspicion that Hermione's journey to Voldemort's cause was complete.When they had found out about her true parentage, that she was not only adopted but an adopted refugee from the first war, she had professed that it would change nothing.Now, still edging for a senior position in the Ministry, and with a new 'Pure Blood' stamp on her papers, Harry had always suspected that her decision to become a Double Agent had, in fact, been a rouse against him.For breakfast, he butchered and roasted the owl on a spit, and enjoyed it with his muggle crewmates, with some fried bacon and frozen vegetables, heated in the can.It made a change from fish...
