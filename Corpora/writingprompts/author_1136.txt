The tome lay heavy in my hand.Immaculate penmanship neatly filled every page even as the number of pages stretched and warped to fit perhaps an infinite number within the leather-clad bindings.Death, for who else could it have been, stood silently within the hooded robe concealing his face."This," I started to say, wanting to make sure I understood what I had been given."This contains the stories of all the possible decisions I could have made, all my choices and their consequences... from birth all the way to my inevitable deaths?""YES."I stared at the book.My whole life, no, all my possible lives.Every selfless and selfish decision, all the heroic and villanous moments, with the opposite paths laid out to show what could have been.What never had been.I closed the book, feeling an anger rising from within."Take it.""WHAT?""Take it," I said again, holding the book out to his skeletal fingers."Burn it."Empty sockets stared at me as the tome, page still open to perfect parchment, was lifted from my hands.Death paused then asked, "WHY?"I glared back at the skull."I lived my life.I made my choices.Good and bad, they were mine.The consequences were mine and I'll own those forever.Being brave enough to believe in the fantasy of love and then working hard to make it a reality?Mine.Choosing to be a father to a child who's sad fate seemed already written and holding her close as she died?Mine.Dealing with betrayals and pain?Mine.Moments of weakness, cowardice, and of laziness?Mine.What may have been is meaningless."With a growl I pointed at the book."That isn't real.That isn't true.My choices made me who I am.All the way to when you fished me out of the wreckage my body had become.There's no point in either wallowing in over how much better things could have been, or letting myself swell with pride over how things could have been worse.What was, was.And I am who I am.So burn that, throw it away.I don't want it."With a loud snap, Death closed the book.As I watched, it burst into flames and quickly became ash flowing away in the ethereal wind.I felt a tension in my soul ease and I asked, "Now what?"Behind the dark figure a light had begun to shine."NOW YOU ARE READY FOR WHAT COMES NEXT."He moved aside.And I walked forward.
