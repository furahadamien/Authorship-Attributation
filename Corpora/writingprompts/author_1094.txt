To anyone listening, if anyone still can.If it's not already too late...Warn them.Mars.Ha.We thought they beat us here, damn them, we were angry.Disappointed.Righteously indignant.One thing we weren't was scared.Now the last of us huddle here in the bone fields, trying to ignore the teeth marks all around us and stare disbelivingly at the symbol in front of us.The same Hammer and Sickle we first saw when we discovered the caves.But old.So very very godamn OLD.How many thousands of years does our equipment tell us it's been here?How much of the dust beneath our feet was once bone?Anyone who's listening...Ask yourselves "when"

WHEN did they start using the Hammer and Sickle.When did they arrive.
