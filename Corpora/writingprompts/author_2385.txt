A man stumbled from within the cover of a copse of trees, seemingly having come from the shadows.His hair was a mess of ebon curls, gray striking it here and there, and it took him a moment for his eyes to regain focus.Once it had, the pale-skinned man brushed his hands over the non-existant dust on his coat.In just a few minutes, the man had regained his composure, and he stood with his spine straight as he strided from the shadows of the trees.The skies up above were dark, with only the distant lights of the stars piercing through, while a dim, crescent-shaped moon hung over the horizon.Beyond the grove of trees the man had come from, the park was one made up of grassy fields.With night having fallen, a quiet had settled, and the man found himself alone as he walked beneath the waning light of the moon, towards a busy intersection.The silence of the night began to trickle away as he neared the road, and the noise of the traffic rushed in with the piercing noise of a car /beeping/, once, twice.The sound was grating, but the man barely paid any attention to it as he approached a bench sitting at the side of the street.On the bench, a young man sat, reading a newspaper, his skin resembling the dark hue of the skies above.The shadows underneath his eyes were barely distinguishable, though there, still.The younger man glanced up as the pale fellow approached, and he offered a smile.It held a hint of weariness."How was your trip, Elias?"the dark-skinned man asked as the other took a seat next to him."Come here for any particular reason?""Oh, the usual, as you know it, Markus.Except I grew rather nauseous during half of it.Probably the brocolli I'd eaten the other day... well, earlier."Elias let out a soft grunt as he took a seat, his frame relaxing somewhat as he slouched forward."Ah, yes.I heard Queen Elizabeth the third took a nasty fall around this time, and I was looking into it."A small smile tugged at Markus's lips, his teeth white against his dark flesh.His eyes wandered over the traffic and towards the occasional passing figure.Folding the newspaper he held on his lap, he said, voice soft, "I hadn't heard such a thing.But the Queen /was/ in a foul mood the other day.At least, according to the palace guards.""Is that so?Hm.I suppose this might have led to the tumble she took."Elias frowned thoughtfully, before turning his blue-eyed gaze towards Markus."And how have you been, old friend?"Markus gave a small shake of his head."Exhausted... it gets tiring, watching people make the same mistakes over the years."Though his voice was soft, he was easily heard over the noise of traffic."A friend of mine has gotten into another fight with that husband of hers.If they would only /talk/ to each other..."

A dry laugh snorted out from Elias."Oh, you know how it is, Markus.We've all got that damn pride holding us back.""I know..." Markus loosed a sigh, one filled with weariness, before a grin flickered across his lips as he glanced back to Elias."A drink?A new pub's opened up down the street.They've got some great cocktails, I hear."Almost immediately, Elias pushed to his feet.His lips peeled back to reveal a grin as he said, "Sounds like a fucking good idea.Come on, lead the way."
