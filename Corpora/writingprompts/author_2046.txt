The tunnel stretched without end.As I walked, I wondered 

how I was left with no friend.&#x200B;

The many I had not saved,

those whose lives

disease had plagued.&#x200B;

I walked alone.I realized

they had done the same.I could not stand it,

that is decidedly lame.&#x200B;

Others were with me when I left:

my students, family, friends,

and yet company I am now bereft.&#x200B;

Fighting death was my life.I worked hard, for without me

it brought struggle and strife.&#x200B;

From me, death could not run, 

now loneliness cannot hide.I was the first paramedic;

I will be the first guide.
