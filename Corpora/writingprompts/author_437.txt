**6th April, 2037 - HMAS *Maryborough*, Somewhere off the coast of Australia**

"So, the yanks bought it?"The speaker leans heavily against the rail, staring at the smouldering coastline.A deck above, overstressed rotor blades whine slowly, cooling in the ocean breeze."Oh yes.Contrition, shame, repentance...if we'd brought a whip along, I reckon their delegation would have flagellated themselves."The new arrival joins him, steadying herself as the vessel rocks in an errant swell."Hmph.Bloody typical.Living like the world's a movie, where they're the heroes and everybody else is either a sidekick to use, a villain to fight or just part of the fucking scenery."He sighs, rubbing shaking fingers across his eyes, as if massage will bring vision back into being."I wouldn't have believed you, even a week ago.But they took it without even raising a single protest.Fifty years, as of 5 days ago..."

She trails off, suddenly guilty.A few minutes either way, and she could have been like him.One of the thousands left burnt and sightless.They would probably never know whose it was that did it, not that it mattered.Russian, Chinese, American, Korean, Japanese...maybe even their own."Of course.The Americans are like children, when you get right down to it.A billion dead, more injured, climate buggered, but the story must go on.They know they've done wrong, so they're expecting to be put into timeout."A chuckle, the first in what feels like years, forces its way out of her at the mental image that conjures.Her mind turns back to the stories of her youth."Well, that's what happens when the 'hero' does a bad thing, isn't it?He goes into exile, to repent his sins, and gets called back when the world needs to be saved again.Superman, Batman..."

Her companion tries to join her, but lapses into a throaty cough instead."More...like...the fucking...Hulk."He stumbles, the jerky movements pulling several tubes taut against his chest.A strident beeping begins to sound, soon joined by one buzzer, then another."Oh jesus... Nurse!NURSE!"A bandaged hand clutches her arm."They...want...a story.Give...them...one."Her tears were simply a drop in the ocean.**9th April 2037 - Bundaberg Disaster Relief Centre**

His communications centre looked a lot like hers, she mused, as the technicians scurried around the jury-rigged setup, making sure the link was at least semi-stable."This is quite a surprise, Deputy Prime Minister.I believe it was you who convinced us all to live out the next fifty years in isolation, after all.Come to leave your neighbours with some parting words of wisdom?Perhaps apologise for joining the rest of them in burning the world down?"Her eyes widened, and she mentally kicked herself.Of course he knew.The Tasman wasn't that wide, and just because they'd forsaken a military, didn't make them stupid.Hell, even an idiot could tell a rocket going up from one coming down."Prime Minister, actually.As of Monday.And no.To the former, at least."She took a guilty sort of pleasure in watching him sigh, the bags under his eyes suddenly looking unbearably heavy."A good man, if misguided.Another life burnt on the atomic pyre.He will be missed.What do you want then, Ms Prime Minister?I have fifty years to prepare my country for the next ride on this insane merry-go-round, and I don't intend to waste it."Here it was.If she couldn't convince this man, then there was no point in trying anywhere else.If she could...

"Let me tell you a story."He listened.He doubted.He laughed.He doubted some more.He threatened to cut off the call.He thought.He called for advisors.He doubted.He refused to believe.He had it repeated.He laughed.He doubted.He agreed.**6th April, 2087 - New Brisbane, 2km underground**

"Pickups are live.Boarding has been reported complete, and all birds are green.Looks like they're really going to do it."Chatter fills the air conditioned command centre.Overhead, screens regurgitate a million different data streams - live footage, passenger estimates, a few colour commentators.Bound to her life support chair, the ex-Prime Minister smiles as one of the feeds momentarily cuts above the rest."-and we are here today not in sorrow, but in determination.To follow our brothers and sisters to the stars, to rejoin the-"

She raises her voice, the inbuilt amplifiers carrying it across the busy room."Get your bets in!She's just about to announce the name!"The assembled representatives, covering most of the remaining nations on the planet, chuckle politely."Still ordering everyone around, I see, 'Mum'?"The Indonesian ambassador pats her on the shoulder, and she grasps his hand."You bloody well bet I am.Somebody has to keep this lot on task.Got your bet in?"He looks stricken."You know that the Quran forbids-"

She gives him a Stare."...20 on *Enterprise*, ma'am.Seems fitting.'Boldly go', and all that."She laughs, and turns back to the screens.A countdown has appeared, framing the giant silver ship they show, looming over a cracked mesa."Y'know, you ought to be right.All those years ago, when I came up with this batshit idea, I probably would have agreed.But as much as they need a story, I think there's one thing they need more.And it's what we're giving them, even though they'll never know it."The view changes back to the figure at the podium."With that, I christen her...*Independence*."
