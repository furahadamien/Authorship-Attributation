"A-140 says, are you ready for your next inhale?would you still want to go back to earth?We could send you to a new civilization" 

"A-110, I, I,.... " 

"A-140, listen, you know there's not much cosmic year here left, you must go back and recover the master chip.Shall I remind you that without the master chip, we won't be able to live after human space time?????Our families will eternally die in whichever universe they were living in and only us, the protectors can find the master chip!"A-110, but, my family, I've been gone for 10 cosmic years!, are they grown?Have they crossed dimension yet?"A-140, you know once they've reached space capacity they must join and follow their DNA 

I could tell you in which galaxy they're located.But you know in human skin, they will not recognize you, ever

But remember, like you, they are trying to locate the master chip.And once they do, you will be able to stay in whichever universe and more, with the ability to recognize each other in human space time!  "[silence]

"A-110 give me grade H-1036, I've traced this galaxy from the human space time I spent on earth 2-3902 

I can feel I'm getting closer to the master chip, till then, send as much A's we have available, we need more than 4 on each galaxy of 0 

Till then
