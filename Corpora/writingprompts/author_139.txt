I wake to my phone buzzing on the night stand.I look at the clock next to it.The green numbers shine brightly: 3:14 AM.'What the hell?'I think to myself.'Why is anyone texting me at 3 in the morning?'Before I can take a look, it starts buzzing again.And again.It won't stop.I grab the phone and mute it quickly but the notifications continue to pop up silently."It's a beautiful night tonight.Look outside."They're texts coming from my mother, my friends, my siblings, even some numbers I don't recognize.An unfamiliar alarm blares on my phone.A new notification pops up on my phone, titled US Government Emergency Alert.It reads "DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON."'This is weird,' I think to myself, 'What the hell could be wrong with the moon?'I walk to my window.I carefully open the curtains halfway so the moon is still covered.The sight is incredible.Almost all of my neighbors are standing outside, phone in hand.They're staring upward in the direction of the moon.They're walking around talking to each other, pointing to the sky.'I gotta see what the hell is going on.'I walk outside and jog over next door, carefully keeping my eyes lowered.My neighbour is standing by his door.I'm about to call out to him when he interrupts me."Hey!Have you seen the moon tonight?"he asks."Listen man, something weird is going on.It's 3 in the morning, why are you outside right now?Why is half the neighbourhood outside?"I reply."You haven't looked yet, have you?"he laughs."Did you just ignore everything I said?Why are you outside?What's wrong with the moon?"Without warning, my neighbor rushes up to me and places a hand on each side of my head.He violently turns my head toward the sky."Just look!"Oh.OH.I get it now.This is... incredible.It's impossible.There's no way this can be happening.It's...I don't even know.I have to tell someone about this.I take out my phone and draft a message, addressed to everyone on my contact list.I slowly tap in the words "It's a beautiful night tonight.Look outside."
