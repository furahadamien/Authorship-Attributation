I wake up slowly, quietly.I do not get up though.I am too busy thinking about my night-self.He was strange.He lacked fur and did not nest in trees like my tribe and I do.He used tools that none of us would ever think possible.I am struggling to remember my night-self.Maybe, just maybe I can use his teachings.I cannot use his tools, for they do not exist.But I can adapt.I can alter them.Make tools like the ones he used out of things around me.Yes, that will be good.I can make wood let out sunlight.I can turn stone sharp.My night-self could survive in all places.He knew secrets of plants and animals.Those that can kill us, and those that can save us.I can teach these things to my tribe, and with that and the tools I will make, we shall be the greatest tribe.We shall no longer fear the night or the great beasts.We shall walk the land like he did.I must work now, before I forget my dream-self completely.What was that thing he used to call himself?A name, yes that was it.A name.A good thing to have.I should use that with my tribe, along with this...this language thing he used.And my name shall be his name, for he is my teacher.From now on, I shall be known as Bear Grills.
