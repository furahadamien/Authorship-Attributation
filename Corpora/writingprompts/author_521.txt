"Dad?""Dad are you ok?"I stood there speechless for what felt like forever.Up until this moment my life had been what most would call perfect.A loving, caring wife.An adoring son.The irony that the gift from his last Father's Day that brought joy to my heart is now the source of this terrible anguish.My wife and I have been together for 13 years, and for the most part we've had a wonderful relationship.The spark is still alive and well, but early on we went through a really rough patch.I was working a ton of late nights, she felt neglected and the spark was fading.She decided to go stay with her mother for a while, we didn't talk for almost a month.Well that was all the wake up call I needed.It took a lot of work but we began "dating" each other again and found that groove again.In fact, things were the best they'd ever been.It wasn't long after Ethan was born.She had some complications during labor and the doctors thought we might actually lose both of them, but the good man upstairs was gracious, and they both pulled through.I'm a blessed man, and I thank my lucky stars every day for them, and do everything I can to show my appreciation to them in as many ways as possible.So when I got a text this morning about this stuff with the "#1 Dad" mugs actually displaying a true ranking didn't really have me that worried, but standing here now I can honestly say that I didn't see this coming.Each word cutting deeper than the last.. "You Are Not The Father."
