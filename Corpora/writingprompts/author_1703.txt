I've had it.He's had it.We've all had it.I stormed out the conference room as David, my boss, pushed my buttons for the last time.His condescending demeanor.His unscrupulous attitude.It was on full display when he decided to cut the bottom line by 20%.This meant layoffs for our entry level staff.The thing is, David is keeping his bonus and offered up no solutions to rectify the situation.When I demanded he do something about it, he added me to the list of laid off employees.One week later I decided to start a rival company.With my resources, it wasn't that hard.I hired everyone who was laid off.I then hired the top recruiters in the business and poached his top employees one by one.A year later and my business is thriving.David meanwhile, had quite the year.His wife was seduced by a younger man who happened to be a rising star at my company.The investments he put all his money into folded.He diversified, just not enough after I bought those companies and sunk the value.I hired a prostitute to make contact with him and to get him into heroin.He was not that hard to convince.A month later I visited him at his home.Passing the eviction signs that hung on the door, I found him on the kitchen floor, lying next to a syringe.He just looked so hopeless.That's when I decided to get him up, sit him on the chair, and inject more heroin into him until he passed out.He woke up in an insane asylum, surrounded by pictures of his wife's new family and the top doctors in the world to keep him alive.&#x200B;

Jason was a normal man.He wasn't exactly a straight arrow, however.He lived just below the Heaven line, if you will.Instead of tipping 15%, he may tip 10%.Instead of picking up his dog's feces, he may cover it with leaves.He wasn't perfect.But by no means was he a saint.It was a rainy day.As Jason was driving to work, he hydroplaned and lost control of his vehicle, slamming into a light post.He was declared dead at the scene.Jason's spirit was initially stuck in limbo.With God not knowing what to do with him, he was supposed to be sent to Hell.However, with God's initial indecisiveness, Jason was sent to Heck, or Land of the Heckas.This is where those who are extremely average are sent but tow below that Heaven line where they don't do enough to be in God's good graces.As Jason arrives, he has to walk through Door 1: Social Media.There, he sees the countless Facebook and Twitter posts he makes, such as his mundane activities of going for a walk and then Instagramming his walks.He then reaches Door 2: Netflix.He sees his recording of The Bachelor season finale.Nothing else needs to be said with this.When he reaches Door 3, he sees all the food he threw away as a kid, mainly the brussel sprouts and asparagus he said he loved to his mother.Door 4 is a bit different, as it is just a bubble of awkwardness.A memory kicks back to when he was in high school.At a school dance, he said his date's dress made her look wider than usual.When reaching Door 5, he sees continuous reruns of Friends.Jason wants to stay here, but the Spanish dubbing irritates him.Door 6 is an unused gym membership.He bought the discounted purchase at Costco, thinking he got a deal.But the fact he never goes, it just added to his long list of wasteful purchases.Finally at Door 7, it is a memory of saying he wished he was never born.The turkey was too dry one Thanksgiving holiday.While he still ate it, along with the mashed potatoes and stuffing, he did not say thank you to his mother, who slaved all day at the meal.After finishing the meal, Jason still complained, saying "This family sucks.Why did I have to be born here."When Jason realizes all the things he had done wrong, there was no turning back, as there was no escaping the Land of the Heckas.
