Fermis paradox, it baffles the mind.There is so much to the universe, but not much intelligent life.Humans thought it was because either there was no other intelligent life, or that some great filter existed that kept intelligent life from evolving.The latter is a bit closer to the truth, but not in the way they thought.Sentience is something hard to understand.Most intelligent species dont know where it comes from.The few that do, dont fully understand.The truth is, sentience is part of the universe itself.Kind of like a shared experience between life and the universe.One upside to this is that intelligent life is bound to form anywhere that can support complex living beings.The downside is that theres only so much to go around.Its not like the other forces in nature.Theres no limit to how much gravity or electro-magnetism can exist, it just does.Sentience is directly linked to the energy in the universe.As energy can neither be created nor destroyed, sentience cant surpass a percentage of the energy in a given universe.The first species to discover this was in a previous universe, unfortunately close to that universes heat death.In our universe, it was discovered fairly early on.A galactic council was set up between all known species to allocate population control.There were strict laws in place for reproducing across the universe.Applications had to be approved by a sub sect of the galactic council on every planet.Each planet was given a number not to pass yearly based on the number of deceased beings the year prior.It was very closely maintained.Recently there has been a large uptick in the number of deceased beings and, more alarmingly, a larger number of births born lifeless.Somehow the universal limit had been reached.The council members were perplexed, they had always left at least 5 billion total left over just in case.There was no way their math was off by that much, that left only 1 possibility.Somewhere in the universe was undiscovered sentient life.The council immediately sent notice to all discovery crews to scour their sector again.Somehow there was life out there that reproduced so fast that it was disrupting the natural order.The crews were dispatched and the search began.Back at the council chambers, representatives of every species gathered and waited for news.A search for sentient life was conducted every quarter rotation of an average Galaxy, so labeled 1 galactic standard rotation.That was, on average, every 62.5 million years per search.It hadn't been that long since the last one though, not even 1/8th of a rotation.Every planet with life showed only the basest forms, nothing capable of actual sentience.Humanity has existed on earth in its current form for 200,000 years.Nowhere in the universe is there another species that reproduces at the rate humans do.The average lifespan of a human is approximately 73 Earth years.Compared to the average lifespan of all other species though thats nothing.The average lifespan of most others is 1,500 Earth years, give or take a bit.It was inconceivable to the rest of the galactic community that such a species could exist.That is exactly why humanity slipped under the radar, figuratively and literally.At the end of the search, 3 different planets supporting undiscovered sentient life were uncovered.One had a small population doomed for extinction due to planetary effects.One was small and advancing quickly, peaceful contact was made with them and they were introduced to the galactic community.There were only 263,000 between those two planets, 95% of those being on the latter.The last planet discovered sent shockwaves through the universe.Earth, as the native inhabitants called it, had a stunning 5.1 billion sentient beings when discovered.That was only one species, there were others on the cusp of sentience as well.Nothing like this had ever been seen before.These Humans reproduced at an astonishing rate, everything on that planet did.Once found, the Council ordered surveillance on the planet to get an accurate reading on life there.After 30 Earth years the survey was completed.In that short time, they watched as the population of sentient beings grew from approximately 5.1 Billion to 7.7 Billion.The council was sent word immediately.Panic set in as Earths population grew out of control.The Council gathered to discuss options.The following record is as close to Human English as there could be.They reproduce to quickly, the only option is to neutralize the planet. Council Member Grazaad said.We have looked at their history as well.Not only do they reproduce faster than any known species, they are highly aggressive even amongst one another. Council Member Breght Tan Knlowgler said.A round of Here, here broke out amongst the members.I believe there is another way, Council Member Tom said.Everyone quieted down.Why waste an entire species, They are on the very edge of sentience as it is it seems.We must deploy the (no translation exists).It is the only way to ensure the safety of the entire Galactic Community That has been banned by Council Law and you know it. Council Member Leplendersticht said.Desperate times. Council Member Tom replied.And so, a fleet of ships was sent to Earth with the solution on board.Once in orbit, the (no translation exists) was powered up and aimed at Earth.Once unleashed it would revert the Humans to non-sentient beings, effectively rendering them nothing but lowly beasts once again.It would strip the intelligence from any being close to sentience as well, ensuring none on the planet could come that close again.As Council Member Tom said, why waste an entire species.There were lots of mouths to feed in the universe.Thank you for reading!More from me at
