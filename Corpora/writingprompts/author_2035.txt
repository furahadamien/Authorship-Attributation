In life, walkings a breeze.Just one foot in front of the other.Here, well that feeling of the universe sliding along inside you right now?Thats because youre immobile now; a fixed point.To be alive is to have the ability to move through time and space.For the rest of us, the universe, very much alive and expanding, is ripping its way through the part of you that remains to understand me now.The feeling that all your orifices and pores are fire hydrants of stinging hot shit goes away if you start perceiving yourself less a you and more a us.See?Isnt that better?Took forever to figure that out, but isnt being a refraction of a cosmic whole just a way more interesting dynamic?Oh youre crying.Gosh, thats a new one.Family?No, sorry it doesnt work like that.You either reflect, refract or disperse but you dont interact with other patterns.Not as in its not permitted (everything is permitted in death, for what is a world without definition or form but non-being if you want to get cosmic about it, which lets be honest for a secondthis existence tends to do) but as in its not possible.Me?Im not a pattern.Not anymore;  a long story and its not like weve got all the time in creation.Ha ha, but yes I was the first to die, which Ive been told means my name is Able, which suits me though we didnt have names for we did not yet have words when I was last what you just were.So heres the thing: Weve been moving this whole time.Just not in space or time, but perception.Can you feel it?There!Just for a second you saw it!You were it!The infinite!The reality that our lives (such that we lived them) were not just one of billions of other souls on a single solitary outpost of life in a universe that teemed with every kind and form of the stuff, but just one of an infinite variation of each and every possibility of ourselves and our worlds that we could imagine.That there are no wrong choices, because every choice that could possibly be made was made somewhere in an infinite sea of possibility.And how instead of despairing for how small and pointless our actions were in the cosmic scheme of things we should rejoice because this means that every action we make can be our own, no matter the circumstance.There is no path not taken, so go whichever way you damn choose; Its your trip.How do I know you felt all this too, friend?Look down:
You took a step!
