This place is cold.The walls are white, and I havent seen anyone besides doctors, guards, and men in orange jumpsuits who prod and question me in months.I can hear through a wall that the man in the room next to me was sharing a similar fate.We talked to each other, told our stories.Like me, he was one of the lucky ones.Like me, the soldiers in white wearing the strange insignias had broken into his house and taken him away in the night.And like me, he had no idea how they were immune to his defensive efforts.This morning, a doctor came to visit me.I asked him who he was.He said he was a nobody.A low-level researcher at some Foundation.I asked him why I was here.He said it was to protect me and the human race.Its night.Its warm at night.
