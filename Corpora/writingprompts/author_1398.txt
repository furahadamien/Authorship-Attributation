"Dude, fuck Life.What a dick."said Dan.A lazy man with even lazier grooming habits, Dan burped and slurped another Rolling Rock.As a black crow picked at the remains of a corpse on his front lawn, Dan reached back into his cooler-chair and grabbed another cold one."You want one?Or are you still 'gluten' free," muttered Dan."I can't believe I'm stuck at the end of the world with my ex...  " muttered Genivee.She was a beautiful woman.Was.A failed young marriage and a career and a half later, she looked like a woman whose best days had left her."YOU HEAR ME DEATH?FUCK YOU.YOU SUCK AT YOUR JOB!"screamed Genivee."Tried that.He ain't coming."said Dan."How do you know Death is a He?Maybe it's a She?Or maybe Death doesn't have any pronouns."tendered Genivee."Does anyone give a shit?"fired Dan."Give me the goddamn beer," returned Genivee.Dan chucked a can to Genivee, who, of course, dropped it.She was never great at catching things.The can rolled toward the corpse to the crow."You didn't have to throw it that hard."said Genivee."I didn't throw it that hard," retorted Dan."You totally chucked..."
"I threw it normal"
"Throw it normal, what does that mean..."

"WILL YOU TWO SHUT UP?""What did you say to me?!""I didn't say shit, there you go again, always accusing me..."

"HELLO, DOWN HERE!"The crow turned it's head and waved it's little wing.In a flash of light, the crow and the corpse disappeared, and, out of nowhere, appeared the Mick Jagger dressed in an all black suit."HOLY FUCK!MICK JAGGER?!I LOVED YOU IN THE BEATLES!"screamed Dan.After a dumbfounded glance, Genivee studied the Mr. Jagger and carefully asked, "who are you?""Please allow me to introduce myself.I'm a man of wealth and taste..."   

"Wait, isn't that a Rolling Stones song?"asked Dan."Good Lord...I'm Death, you nitwit.I figured I'd at least dress in style to meet my new subjects.A more familiar form, no?""So, can I have your autograph?"returned Dan."God, I can't believe you and I had sex...Sorry, mister, um, Death?Subjects?"asked Genivee."Yes.Subjects.You two are the last humans alive, and, well, per Eden Protocol 101, I am to keep you alive so you can procreate.Or else I shall be eliminated.Rather ironic, no?"Death said with a smirk.Genivee, dumbfounded, turned and vomited onto Dan's half dead lawn."I thought you might like that, Genny.You Mortals seem to think Death and Life are separate, but you were all rather mistaken.Well, except the Buddhists, they got it right.But, if you asked me, they lived such rather boring lives anyway that I daresay I can count that as living"  laughed Death."Excuse me, Mr. Jagger.I'm a little confused.Are you saying that we are like some sorta Adam and Eve or something?"asked Dan earnestly."Well done, Daniel,"  applauded Death.He picked up the Rolling Rock and, with a snap, the can turned into a martini with a black olive garnish."Surely, there must be some mistake... how can we procreate if we hate each other?Aren't there other couples that may be better suited?Barack and Michelle?Kristen Bell and Dak Shepherd?Hell, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West?"pleaded Genivee."Others?Who better than you two?You two fit the bill, perfectly.Oh, and don't call me surely.Did I do that right?"snickered Death."Fit the bill?Of whom?"asked Genivee."Of Adam and Eve.You two are splitting images of them."answered Death.Dan and Genivee gave each other a flabbergasted look as if each were trying to see if either could be the Father and Mother of man.Dan took his hands and began to protect his ribs."I'm not taking your ribs, you fool.Besides, you have too much fat on them anyways..." sneered Death."How are we like Adam and Eve?Weren't they kind and welcoming parents?"asked Genivee."They HATED each other.All their bickering."laughed Death."And that family was a disaster.One of their sons murdered the other?!Hardly great parenting don't you think?""Why do you thinkhumankind was such a disaster?All the fighting and killing and sex.It was truly rather entertaining watching you little humans hurt each other so.I had them entertained for eons!But it got old and you mortals blew each other up anyways...So think of it as a... reboot of sorts..." gleamed Death.He finished His martini and then snapped his fingers.A California King drapped in black satin sheets appeared."We're ready for you two to start whenever youre ready."
