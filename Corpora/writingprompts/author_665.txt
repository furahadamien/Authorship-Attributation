I was 28 when the first doses of the drug were administered.It was truly depressing seeing family and friends receive the drug while so many of us in the now dubbed "lost generation" proceeded to grow old just as we had believed we all would.Then when I turned 50, we began seeing reports of the effects of the drug.At first it was a few cases, but quickly more cane to follow.People who had taken the drug first 22 years ago were now taking on a physical aura which made them look like divine beings."God damnit" I thought.I immediately proceeded to the top of a tall buiding and threw myself off.
