There was only so much he could take.So much to hold in.The paint knife twitched in Bob's hand."You mean like this, Mr.Ross?"Bob smiled."Yes, Adolf.Exactly like that.You can do anything you want here, aaanything you want."The words echoed through his mind, haunting him.He saw the black-and-white horror of Auschwitz again, the very pictures they'd been shown in the Air Force.His own words captioned the horrors of the Holocaust.*"You can do anything you want.This is your world."*

The back of the aspiring young artist before him shifted, shoulders rising and falling with eager brush strokes as Mr. Hitler brushed up a forest of magnificent spruce trees.Bob's grip on the paint knife tightened.Adolf seemed so full of life these days, so content with himself.There was a newfound light in him that Bob so loved to see -- it was what made him cherish teaching.It was the true Joy of Painting, to shed your worries and focus on the canvas, pouring yourself out for all of your world to see, whether it was millions on national television or simply your loved ones.There was such beauty in it, such beauty.Could he truly say he was better than this man?Bob still remembered the hateful and angry person he had once been.The Air Force had brought out the worst in him.He didn't deserve to be saved, yet he had found salvation in painting anyway.Who was he to deny another person this?Another living, breathing human being.And yet the stakes were too high.In the end, that warrior Bob had once been had never truly died.He had simply stepped aside to let the painter flourish.Now that same warrior stepped forward, the paint knife steady in his hand, its surface glimmering titanium white.Adolf Hitler never saw it coming.A river of red danced down the landscape.It blinded Bob with tears.Even at a moment like this, there was beauty to be found on the canvas.
