Let's just say I didn't hang around to chat.Back at home, my heart racing, my ears still ringing from the gunshots.I'd never been mugged, and I didn't like the feeling, not even if it was unexplainably crazy.What was that guy on?Did he think he was helping me?I felt violated.I took a shower, and started making something to eat.I knew I should report it to the police, but what do I say?The thing was ripped to shreds, it's not like he was stealing anything, and he didn't really look like he wanted a reason to shoot me.The motive was a mystery, and the more I thought about it the more it nagged at me.I grabbed my laptop and started looking online.I quickly found reports that sounded similar.A lot of noise, mind you, but the ones that went down eerily like mine started happening a month or two ago.The police were never much use, they tried to help but there was never any trail left by the attackers.After a few hours (and an episode or three of something on Netflix in the middle), I felt like I was making some progress.I found a cryptic post where someone was posting what mainly looked like gibberish, but I noticed the telltale "h, t, t, p, s" of a hyperlink in odd places and misspellings near the start of the post.I unscrambled the link, entered it into my browser, but was met with the familiar HTTP Payment Required error page and the dollar sign instead of the little padlock.I was paying my ISP for unlimited channels, but this domain seemed to be hosted somewhere serviced only by Christmas Island, and I had to pay them directly to transit their network.I went straight for my wallet, and... it wasn't there.That put my research at a dead-end that night.I didn't have Paypal any more after they got priced out of the market for their bandwidth, I'd have to wait until I could get my card numbers reissued.I went to the police first.They were friendly, but like all of the other accounts, they couldn't get anywhere with the information I had.I never bothered picking up the research again, but from time to time I still like to imagine - who was the mysterious Goat man from the .cx website?What information did they have?Would I have even cared if my wallet wasn't stolen?I think I'm better off having not chased down that hole.
