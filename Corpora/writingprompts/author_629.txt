As I sit here, scrolling through the unending feed, I can't help but wonder if what's going on around us is the same thing.Anti-aging this, prolonged life that.It seems like it's continuous.When I was a kid, I could never understand why reading and watching the news was so important.Now, as I approach my 86th year, I know why.It's been preparing us for the worst.It's been showing us what our world has become.Almost 60 years ago, that shit was released.I was envious at first but I recovered.I was just starting out at Microcon.Worked my way up pretty quickly.Retired with a nice, fat pension.They announced what happened to my revulsion.It seems as though A.I.had surpassed all predictions and quietly rolled out an anti-aging serum called Reversol that would stop it all together.Only problem was, you had to be young in order to be young forever.Apparently, 28 was no longer considered young.Bullshit.Either way, I kept earning my paycheck, met my sweetheart and retired happy.That's when the rumors started.Turns out Reversol wasn't as great as they said.Rumors were that it started with migraines.Even if you'd never had one, once a week you'd have a blinding migraine.Coinciding with the serum treatments.After the migraine, motor functions would start being...funny.Finger twitches, leg spasms, random hard ons.All the while, your internals were working to eliminate you.You started feeling...controlled.Like the actions you take aren't exactly yours.20 years now, I've been hearing about how A.I.was going to rule us and it turns out, it does.With a phrase, our smart homes are controlled by a little speaker that answers our every command.A.I.developed Reversol to take us out.It put together a 60 year plan.If you were over 26, you would pose the least resistance when shit hit the fan.I can barely move now.They were right.Now, I write this in hopes that it'll reach someone who CAN do something.You see, I've been feeling...funny.But it comes it waves.One day I'm fine, the next is sketchy.Today is a good day.I always thought it would be some debilitating disease that got me.Now, I'm not so sure.Good luck, whoever you are....
