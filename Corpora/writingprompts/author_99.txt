His chest heaves upward, lungs expanding as fast as the air entered and a coughing fit ensues.His brown eyes on the verge of falling out, roll around the sockets; mind scrambling as it tried to process the last seconds of memory."Easy.Easy.Just breathe.You'll be okay.It's all over now", assures a calm voice that sounded oddly familiar."W-what.....where am I....I-I just....the hell is going on...", he mutters out, somewhat incoherently.His mind races as it continues to come to terms with what had just happened."You've just experienced a traumatic death.Not the worse but certainly not my choice if I had the option", the voice says in such a cavalier tone accompanied with a soft chuckle."I just experienced what?", he says both aloud and in his mind.It was then that he noticed he was sitting in large red movie chair.Before him was a decent sized screen that played nothing.He goes to stand but cannot."What the hell?Lemme outta here!What's going on?!Where am I!"He struggles to lift himself out of the chair in between sporadic head swivels, in order to see who he was talking to.Unbeknownst to him, the weight of his denial was holding him down."Those are all great questions!If you direct your attention to the screen ahead, all your questions will be answered.We only have 30 minutes and I still need to process you", replied the cheerful sounding voice."What are you talking about!", he further questions before his eyes look up in reaction to the dimming overhead theater lights.A few seconds of darkness and quietness pass before the film reel countdown began from 3.Suddenly a third person view comes to the screen.At first he isn't sure what he is seeing despite the familiarity of it all.The 'camera' hovers over a sleeping Kingsley.From within the chair his eyes squint a little trying to make sense of what he was seeing."Is that me?...", he softly mutters to himself mostly.From within the shot, you can hear the sudden bit of chaos break out; glass shatters, screams are heard which wake the sleeping male up.He looks a little confused at first, but soon very vigilant once he hears his name being screamed from the floor below.King rushes out of bed in his favorite pajama onesie.This revelation causes the viewer to look down upon himself.He is shook to the core at what he sees."Wait a minute...it can't be me....but why does..." He shakes his head and closes his eyes tightly."I'mjustdreaming.I'mjustdreaming.I'mjustdreaming.C'mon....wake the fuck up King...wake.up.""If you don't open your eyes then you'll miss it and well, we'll just have to start all over.Which is fine or whatever, buuuut I have an appointment with you in like...seven minutes and I really need to use the bathroom.Hahaha!Just kidding.We don't use the bathrooms here!"He slowly peels open his eyes after his chanting fails him.In that moment he watches his last minutes in life.Tears well up on his eyes as he soon starts to remember and in a way, relive his death."Oh God...mom...", was all he could muster and focus on."There was...an intruder....he had a gun...we struggled and...there was a shot....no two...three...four...", he recounts without looking at the screen."I remember now.I was shot in the chest.I'm..."

"Go on...", ushers the voice in a softer more sympathetic tone."...dead."The 'camera' hovers over Kingsley while the warm crimson fluid drains from it's vessel, pooling around his lifeless form.He could hear the distance shrills of what turns out to be his mother dealing with the attacker.Then it fades to black."Wait..waitaminute.What about my mom?Did...did she...is she safe?Is she okay?", King spitfired."Honestly, I couldn't tell ya.This was as far as we could see and nothing more.Sorry."He softly begins to sob at the revelation.King fought with the truth a few more moments before coming to terms to what had happened.He just hoped that his efforts were not in vain.From beside his head comes a box of tissues.Here.Theyre Kleenex.Extra extra soft.One of kind, says the awfully cheerful sounding voice this time sounding much much closer.King turns his head slightly to see that a hand was actually holding the box of tissue.His eyes follow the hand past the wrist over the clothing and to the face which shook him enough to knock him out of his seat, surprisingly as he was just stuck minutes before.SHIT!Y-youre...Cooper?

In the spirit!, responds Cooper who was dressed in a 90s Mighty Ducks t-shirt, a pair of stone washed blue jeans and sneakers that never made it pass the decade.But youre my imaginary friend.How?, King asks.Yes I am., he says proudly with a smile.Although you kinda forgot about me when you started learning about porn and video games.But to explain: it helps to ease the mind...spirit rather, if the deceased encounters a familiar face..Sometimes Im Cooper sometimes Im the hot chick you dated after college.Really depends on the life

On the life... ?College?I went to college?Im only 17.I havent even picked..

Well not in this life, but youll start to catch on to everything after the first decade.Ive yet to be a talking dog.So many cats though.Jeez.Are you gonna take one?, he says in reference to the tissues.While staring at his old friend he slowly removes two then dabs his tears away.Cooper holds out his hand to help King from the ground then does an about face and heads on towards the door.You never said where I was.You just said Im dead, alludes the deceased as they pass through the first pair of doors.They walk down this long hallway that had hundreds of paintings and pictures - moving and none moving - hanging from the wall.He examines them as best he could while following behind his forgotten imaginary buddy.Right.Well you very much so.You dont come here unless you are except for the time the Winchesters...ya know what, nevermind.Reincarnation is real and you are not a pebble on the bottom of lake bed.Although you should probably be after you let those goldfish die.

Goldfish?, he says as he racks his brain.Wait, you mean Goldeen?

Was that its name?

Yes.And I was six.I got it at a carnival as a prize.I forgot to feed it and lied about it when questioned and well, yeah.

Oh and what about the time you tripped Valerie in the 5th grade because she told you you were cute and even though you thought she was too, ya had to be a big man and be like ewww cooties.

Seriously, Cooper?Are you really doing this, right now?

You really ask a lot of questions, ya know that.But I digress.You arent a pebble because that doesnt happen when ya die.You end up at an Eigakan.

Movie theater?Wait...howd I know this?Ive never spoken or learned Japanese in my life.

Vi tamen komprenas, kion mi diras.

Esperanto as well?

Cooper chuckles.Youve lived many lives Kingsley.That isnt even the first name your parents chose by the way.Can you believe they were gonna call you Otis?Like really?I feel sorry for the 78 yous that were called Otis.3 of which were 1 of a set of twins.
