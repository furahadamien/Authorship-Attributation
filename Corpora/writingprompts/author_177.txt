I'd better not look.I weigh the pros and cons of this.Worst case scenario for looking: I die painfully.Worst case scenario for not looking: I miss out on some amazing celestial phenomenon.No big.I've missed the eclipse last year.Thanks to the wonders of the Internet, other people can look and put their photos online.I go back to sleep.The next morning, I head straight for my computer as I usually do before I start preparing for the day.I keep Reddit as my default page.There are times when Reddit is slow to open, which is annoying as hell, but may be my browser's fault.It looks like this will be one of these days, and every thumbnail shows only a black box.But all the posts are the same.They read "Last night was a beautiful night.Look at the moon."After showering, dressing, and eating my breakfast, the screen has not changed, no matter how many times I exit and reopen the window.I could try to click on one of the posts, but something in the back of my head warns that I don't want to do that.I don't know what I'll open.

The blindness passed by some sort of contagion, and by dumb luck I managed to avoid it.I had been out in the cabin in Montana.The cabin I always hated but had acted as my unwitting savior.I wasn't outdoorsy like my dad.After Dad died, Mom wanted to sell the cabin: she wasn't outdoorsy either.Someone had to go and make sure it was in decent enough condition to sell.Out of cell phone range.No Internet access or television.Only a CB radio for emergencies that I had never really bothered to learn before, so I tried to learn all the basics from an old manual.There wasn't much else to do.The cabin was sellable at least, until the world collapsed and then people weren't really wanting to live miles out in the middle of nowhere.They wanted to live by other people.I was driving back through a small town when an older man stumbled out in the middle of the road.I slammed on the brakes and the car halted inches away from him.He stood still and angled his head, never quite looking at me.I learned why when I saw a milky white sheen had covered his eyes.I could not bring myself to move, to do the decent thing and get out and apologize for almost killing him."A car!"he yelled, his voice carrying like a town crier's."I heard a car!"Slowly other people emerged.They, too, stepped cautiously, tapping their canes.All of them had the same milky white affliction that the man had.Wham!One of the townspeople had found the car.This soon followed by more whams as they slapped against the car doors and trailed their hands along to the windows.Then -- crash -- the back windshield and a side window splintered as canes turned into temporary battering rams.Their hands started reaching in, seemingly undeterred that the jagged glass was slicing into their hands and wrists.I slammed on the horn.It startled some of them back, the ones closest to the driver's seat.I took advantage of that second and pressed the gas pedal down hard.The car lunged forward and the people lunged forward with it.I swiveled a bit, trying to avoid striking the people in front of me, but I couldn't quite avoid them.Even so, I would not let myself slow down until those people were far behind me.

Since the war, most of Florida had reverted back to its original Everglades environment.Alligators outnumbered the people.Sara was only there to survey the former city of Miami.She was fairly used to the isolation, but it did get unnerving to hear the feral parrots that had taken roost in the buildings scream System alert! to each other.Sara would be the first person on the isolated land to see the ship.She waved to them, emanating friendly or unthreatening.

The ship pulled up alongside a sunken dock.A door on the side of the ship opened and a man in a yellow suit walked out, though Sara had been unable to distinguish whether he was a man or woman until he came near her.Se habla espaol?

Un poco.  Sara frowned and concentrated because those lessons seemed so long ago.She was more adept at reading it on signs, but her ears would not translate as exactly as her eyes.Sabes Americana?

The nation, Sara wanted to ask, but she couldnt remember the word for nation.Was it nacion?She lamely answered instead.Es Florida.Un estado.  She wanted to explain it wasnt a state anymore, but the past tense of the tricky verb had vacated her mind as well.Un parco ahora.

Los otros Americanos.Donde esta?

Viven en las montanas, Sara answered with wavering surety.She tapped her upper chest.Trabajo aqui.Necesita permiso  Sara stumbled over the end of the sentence, You need permission to come here, but that involved more tricky conjugations.Quien tiene la autoridad?Su presidente?  the man barked.Sara shook her head.No mas.Mi jefe-

Esta gobierno?

She didnt know if he was asking about her or her boss, but she was getting sick of answering questions.De donde esta?

The man relented and gave an answer.Cuba.

So she learned Cuba still existed.Her smattering of knowledge about the country was not that favorable.Dictatorship, refugees ...but she mustnt ask about those things.Veen el mundo?

Solo ustedes.El mundo esta bien.

No comprendo.  Because she did not understand what he meant by "fine."She and her coworkers were doing fine as well, but fine could not identify the vast amount of change the rest of the world must have suffered.Ha reconstruido.Sin unstedes.Venemos explorar los restos del los Estados Unidos.

Those last few words surpassed Saras education.No comprendo.

The man was reining in his impatience, but he kept his voice gentle.Preguntara la gente de la comunidad.Vamonos.

Sara would not go with him.Though he was being polite, she could not board that ship with him and his yellow suited crew.No puedo salir.  She took off after that.No apologies, no good wishes, no help.The man and his crew should find their way north easily enough./I apologize for any mistranslations in Spanish and for the lack of accent marks.

I was listening to Rachel talk about The Sixth Sense and about the little things that Bruce Willis should have noticed, like how he appears in the room without remembering actually walking into the room or leaving the office to get to the apartment.He must have noticed that he did not wake up every morning and do his morning routine and pick out the clothes he was going to wear for the day."I'm pretty sure the director intended that.""So is Bruce Willis stupid or something?""He was in denial.His mind could not process those details.""Huh?"Rachel turned to Ollie."You get it, don't you Ollie?About how Bruce Willis's perceptions were different from regular people's?"Ollie looked inexplicably pale."I don't get it," he finally said."Dear lord," Rachel muttered."I see stupid people.""Hey, I'm not stupid," I barked at her."Just because I didn't get some hidden plot in a stupid movie --"

"Do you really remember those things?"Ollie asked."Like getting dressed in the morning."After some thought, I answered, "I usually do.Sometimes I'm on autopilot and I go through the motions without really thinking of them.""See that's what I mean."Rachel sounded triumphant."Bruce Willis didn't really think of those things because they were too insignificant to think about in great detail.When he appeared in a room, he just assumed he entered it because that's how he'd normally get into the room.""Right," I countered."But then how come he didn't remember bigger things, like talking to his wife?Don't you think he would realize that he had not talked to her for months?""He was in denial.""You can't keep saying denial like it explains everything that doesn't make sense.""It makes perfect sense.For this movie, I mean.Part of it was about perception.The kid said that they only see what they want to see.""How did I get here?"Ollie blurted out.For once, Rachel looked bewildered."You walked here with us," I said, glancing around the nearly deserted park."Right but before that.""You rang the doorbell to my house and I opened the door.""How did I get to your door?""You walked.""Did you see me walking over?""No.""Rachel, did you?""No.""I don't remember walking here.I could have just appeared on your doorstep.""I don't think so," I said."It doesn't prove anything.""But I don't remember any of it.Those small details, like the morning routine you mentioned.What exactly is a morning routine anyway.""Getting up, showering, brushing your teeth, getting dressed, ...""I don't do those things.""You must have," Rachel chimed in,  "You aren't dirty and stinky.You wear different clothes every day.""Yeah, but I just picture what I want to wear and the clothes appear on me.I thought that you guys did that too.""Uh no.Are you drunk or something?""It sounds like you're having an existential crisis," I said."Anyway, you're not a ghost.Everyone sees you.You interact with people.""What if I'm not interacting with them and I just think I am?What if you're the only two people who can see me?"We were both shaking our heads."I doubt it.""Or are you even real?""Yeah, of course we're real," I said.This had gotten annoying."Like I said, I remember the small details and so does Rachel."Ollie thought it over."No, you are real but you aren't the real versions of yourselves.Remember that VR helmet you got me for my birthday?Rachel, you were there.You saw it.""Sort of," Rachel hedged."I don't remember taking it off.""I don't remember me giving you the helmet at all," I said, partly joking."Anyway, if that were the case, all you'd have to do is take off the helmet and you'd be back in the real world."The helmet that he was not wearing.But if it put an end to this delusion then I was for giving it a try."Would I?""Take off the helmet."He placed his hands a couple of inches away from his ears and --
