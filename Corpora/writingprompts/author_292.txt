Adam examined himself in his bathroom mirror, thirty minutes to go before his next date with Danica.He flashed his most charming smile.His teeth were the right shade of white and the corners of his mouth were symmetrical, but he still wasnt getting perfectly natural-looking wrinkles around his eyes.As he held the smile in place, he rubbed two more wrinkles onto the skin at the corners of each eye.He tried again.Still not quite right.He walked over to his computer, opened a new tab, and tried a modified search: Most Natural looking eyes in Hollywood. The results were surprisingly divergent from the Best looking eyes in Hollywood. He studied the image of Zac Efron.The curves of Zacs eye wrinkles were more elongated than Adam had previously noticed.He walked back to the bathroom mirror and tried stretching out his own wrinkles.Sure enough, the result was more satisfying.As Adam beamed his smile, that creeping, persistent thought came to him once again, Your looks are not the problem.YOU ARE!.He pushed against it, reassuring himself as he gazed at his own beautiful face.You are beautiful.You are gorgeous.You are flawless.Youre smart, funny, and creative.Not to mention rich.Any woman would be lucky to have you.

This would surely be the version of himself that Danica would love.His facial skin was just the right color, a subtle golden-bronze, and texture, soft and supple, to balance his muscular features.His reddish-brown hair was long and lustrous, but pulled back into a reserved man-bun.He was 63.Tall, but not so tall that there would be an awkward difference in heights.His smile was tuned.His walk was calibrated.Even the creases of his muscular arms were shaped to Danicas body, made for her personal comfort.Yet his mind persisted in its assault, A real man wouldnt need to look like this.

He pushed the thought out of his mind again.He wasnt just real, he was great.Who was as clever?Who as athletic?Who as sweet?Who loved with the kind of passion that he loved?You are the greatest, he whispered to his reflection.This will be the night.I am sure of it.
