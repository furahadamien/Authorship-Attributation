I don't normally write these, but this topic is near to my heart.I recommend a good read too, The Atlantis Gene by A G Riddle, (the first 2 in the triology were good the last was lacking) Anyway, I will write in sections since my free time comes in chunks.Part 1.In the distance, I see the main sequence star glowing brightly still.It's still in it's teenage years, only a little over halfway through it's lifespan, but signs of its aging is showing.Sunspots were measured routinely and the ship already had to shield itself from a particularly strong solar flare.But the volatile star was unlikely the reason for the dead planet they are approaching.The chief scientist postulated that an ancient civilization caused its own demise.He suggested the planet essentially burned itself up.Curiously, he also suggested from previous observations that this civilization came to be so long ago, that they were extinct before the earliest complex life existed on our own home planet.Perhaps, without sibling civilizations, a early species is doomed to fail.Or maybe, rapid evolution did not provide enough intellect to foresee their own destruction.Regardless of the reason, a feeling of sorrow filled my gut for the death of this extraordinary species.It would be soon that we arrive close enough to recieve detailed images of the surface, but I hoped enough reminants of the civilization remained for me to make some educated guesses on how they lived.Even better, if the species preserved their past, I could look into their evolution and perhaps understand what ultimately caused their end.For now, I return to my pod and shut the seal and allow the cool fog that surrounded me to win over my consciousness until we arrive.
