SomewhereElsa
The "room" was silent, only quiet snores echoed throughout the large space.The "meeting room", as they called it, was a rather empty white void, except for the expensive long table made out of bocote wood and the six rather odd beings that sat in similarly expensive chairs.They were all the seven deadly sins, except one was missing.It was Pride, a purple-skinned being with peacock feathers and a beak.The non-existent ticking of the non-existent clock started to tick off everyone who sat there, except Sloth, who was sleeping as usual.Pride was the only reason this meeting was called and yet, the damn sin didn't even show up!&#x200B;

"Let's give Pride two more minutes, then we can dismiss the meetin'," Gluttony, unable to resist its evergrowing hunger any longer (It was a miracle it didn't break sooner), scowled and just like that, an entire feast appeared in front of the sin and only the sin."Why?So we can watch you stuff your lazy-ass?Do you think we can't summon stuff, too?"Envy snarled at the fat sin with a pig snout and ears, its snake tail rattling as it grew more and more impatient."Envy, please," the yellow sin rolled his frog-like eyes and then returned to examining the penny in its webbed talons.The silence started to overtake once more, the impatient tapping coming from Wrath getting increasingly louder until-

The clicking of heels came from the distance and most of the sins perked up, knowing very well who it was.&#x200B;

"And here comes yours, truly!"The obnoxious voice yelled, the sin appearing seemingly out of nowhere as it took its seat next to the light blue, sleeping Sloth.Sloth barely even opened its eyes, then went back to its dreamless rest."FINALLY!"The booming voice of Wrath's echoed throughout the room, startling both Envy and Lust.The voice was like a lion's roar, which was fitting, considering that Wrath had a mane and feline features."What do you mean finally?Was I late?"Pride pondered to itself, but then shook its head in dismissal, "No, impossible.Anyway, what's this about again?"&#x200B;

"You cannot tell me that you forgot.Especially when this is about you and that stupid thing going on right now."Greed huffed, shoving the penny into its pocket and straightening its waistcoat."Oh?Really?Oh, geez!How could I?"Pride chuckled and leaned over the table, "So, what thing?""What thing?What thing??"The jealous sin's slit eyes widened, "This thing!"It took one quick wave and a large projection above them all was summoned, showing a map of the entire world.Another quick wave and it zoomed onto a seemingly random area in America.It took a second for everyone to realize what it was showing, but the six sins eventually got it, except, once again, for the seventh one."And?It's people running around with rainbows drawn on their faces!What's that got to do with me?Are you mocking me?That's so low of you all, I'm not that over the top," Pride shook its head and crossed its arms across its chest."OH YOU LITTLE SACK OF SHIT!DON'T YOU DARE LIE TO US!WE KNOW DAMN WELL THAT IT'S YOU WHO ARRANGED THIS PARADE JUST TO MOCK US!"Wrath boomed, jumping from his seat and pointing accusingly at the smug sin who had no idea what was going on."Honey, acting confused is not helping you.Look at them, they are basking in pride and pride alone!"Lust piped in, nodding towards the thousands of people running around, colorful clothes and flags all around the place, "It's like it was made for you!It's almost like they are praising you!Not that I don't like the amount of skin showing, but still!""Hoo-ho!Wait, really?"Pride stood up, looking intently at the screen."Stop playing dumb.You know very well that none of us agreed to nor even knew about this and yet you went and forced all of the insolent mortals to celebrate your idiotic functions as a sin.We deserve it too!This isn't fair!It isn't!It's not!"Envy's fists hit the table at least six times as it threw a small fit, looking like a child."Guys, my lovely sins, as much as I hate to not take credit for such a flattering event, this isn't my doing.I can't stop those humans from doing what they want, now can I?"Wrath snarled, staring down one of the couples.It was a man, kissing another.Something wasn't right here."Pride, it has your goddamn name in it!Pride Parade!It's a parade about celebrating pride, Pride.That's you."Greed pointed a talon at the sin, its eye twitching."Pride... parade.." Wrath mumbled, which was unusual.Wrath was usually a loud sin, so everyone turned their attention to it."Pride... parade.." Its crimson red, glowing eyes kept shifting from the screen to Pride, growing wider and wider."What is it, Wrath, dear?"Lust questioned, leaning over the table rather inappropriately."Ya know, your mumblin' is... crunch.. scarin'... burp...me."Gluttony eyed the sin as it continued to shove food into its mouth, the growing pile of bones and other leftovers now spread across half of the table.More mumbling filled the void, most of the words incoherent at that point: "Spit it out already, gorilla!"Envy snapped, starting to drag out the s', a habit of its."Pride parade...I don't it's about.. pride as.. the sin and all.." Wrath's brows furrowed.Lust looked up once again and after a moment of silent pondering, the sin's eyes started to widen in realization too as it clutched onto its horns: "Oh my god!How could I have not realized this sooner?""What??"Greed run a hand through its hair, puzzled, just like the rest of the sins."Oooh!"Pride chuckled, also realizing what this was all about, "Oh!Oh.Oh..."

"Am I dumb or are you all suddenly just pulling a prank on me or something?"Envy glared."Pride parades, also known as pride marches, pride events, and pride festivals, are outdoor events celebrating lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer, or LGBTQ if you want, social and self acceptance, achievements, legal rights and pride.."

&#x200B;

A mumbling, though fast voice butted into the conversation and it didn't take long for them to realize it was Sloth, who immediately after fell asleep once more.&#x200B;

"Oh."Envy, Gluttony and Greed let out in unison.
