Youre so lucky to be alive.

This wasnt a surprise to hear.I had always been lucky.In fact, ever since I was born, all I encountered was luck.Always being at the right place, at the right time.When I was little, Mario Party was my favorite game.I won every time.When I turned 18, I bought my first lottery ticket and won the whole goddamn jackpot.I used the money to travel the world, investing just one percent of my $25,000,000,000 winnings (lump sum, of course) into a cryptocurrency I had started years earlier as a joke.I met celebrities everywhere I went, I could always get a cab, and somehow my cryptocurrency took off and I made back trillions more than I could ever imagine.I was happy, successful, and I had ambition.The stats ruined everything.Sometime after I had made my way through all of the Asian countries, ready to embark for the Pacific Islands, a British scientist by the name of  Dr. Killion discovered the statistics.He theorized that every human being had a ranking, from 1-100, for 56 different statistics.Skill, Intelligence, Communication, the list went on.Each statistic represented the maximum potential for any individual in that area, except one.Luck.It was the only statistic no one could understand, and everyone wanted their luck to be high.It seemed that it didnt measure potential, rather it just measured the amount of coincidence that appeared in someones life.Those with a low luck score tended to excel in other areas, it usually balanced out.I had a perfect score of 100.Sure, my communication was in the trash, and my intelligence was only in the low twenties.But it didnt matter.Everyone could understand me, they all believed I spoke to them with my simple wording and EVERYONE encouraged me to be a politician.Until the stats.Once people started getting their stats read, everyone wanted to know their own.Everyone went and got it done.Most people averaged around 50 for about every score, those who scored higher in some also scored quite low in others.Those with incredibly high scores in a few categories would also be inept at many aspects of life.I stopped in Japan, at the worlds top quality Statistics Center, to get mine read.Ill never forget the look on the technicians face.Horror.It wasnt long before I was grabbed, tied up, and shoved in the back of a van.The van broke down a couple times, I know we definitely changed vehicles a couple of times because I felt an engine explode and at least 4 different popped tires.The prison doors wouldnt open, one of the guards recognized me and even tried to help me escape, but it seems I was destined to be behind bars.My existence was wiped, my identity removed from society.I was allowed to live comfortably in the prison, but I got lonely as the only prisoner.No one came to save me, no other 100s ever appeared.I was lucky enough to be the only one with such a high score.I remember my 28th birthday.Someone had asked me the day before when my birthday was, and as luck would have it, it was the next day.Someone was sent out to get a cake, and lucky enough, it was my favorite flavor.I sat miserably as I ate the whole cake, and even got my favorite guard to let me watch some videos on her phone before I had to go to sleep.I didnt even try to escape anymore.It was fun at first, but even luck cant save you from every situation.I couldnt escape, so I looked for the little things.It wasnt until that day, 28 years after I had taken my first breath of fresh air, that I realized things wouldnt get better.All Id ever have is the little things.And it wasnt enough for me.As I heard chimes outside indicating midnights arrival, I kicked away my bed, using the sheets as a makeshift noose.Luckily, I got the knot on my first try, despite not even knowing how to tie it.I woke up out of a coma four months later.Youre lucky to be alive. Thats what the warden said.And it was the moment I realized my luck had run out.
