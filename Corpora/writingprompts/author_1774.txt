"Lettuce Jim prays Tim Book of Holy Harp" cried Longest Beard, addressing the congregation; "Chronicles of Tallest, Smallest, Nails Longest and Tim Strongest!""Prays."Answered the congregation."Annuals of Tim Fastest, Tim First, and Tim what been on Tims moon";

"Prays.""Lettuce jim tanks tim Insane Bolt, fastest tim run 100 Ems.Ancient Measurement of Timlympics.""Tanks"

"Lettuce jim tanks tim Felix and tim Roger, tim arm strong and tim Furman, For who tim greatest if not tim Fur man.Seeker of tim many Records.""Jim tanks!"answered Longest Beards flock; "Tim Fur man!""We jimmum tim Sacrifices in tim honor, in tim memory and tim name.Woah, tim Children of tim Red Bull, Heathers!Wingless Liars!Guinness saves but does not travel well!\*Ptoo\*" Longest Beard spat on the 3 sacrifices.They were tied up and bound together.Heads bowed low, they were frightened."Travel well!"Cried the congregation."\*Ptoo, Ptoo, Ptoo"

"Record!", yelled Longest Beard "For this tim is biggest sacrifice tims memory.Record!Tim biggest sacrifice ever."The congregation cheered, they tossed their hoods into the air above their heads and danced the dosey-doe among themselves.The sacrifices shuddered."Orden!Orden!"cried Longest Beard "Now is tim winter of tims discontentment."The congregation blinked."Strongest Arm step forren."Longest Beard beckoned forth one of his congregation.The burly mutant Strongest Arm.The Rads had given him great strength but only in his right side, his left was withered and malnourished.His left arm hung weekly by his side, while his right, bulging and muscular, tipped him over to one side.He was still very strong however.He could chop Lampposts down with one hand and he once through a stone across the great Black river to the other side."Aye Longest Beard," Strongest Arm grinned a toothy grin, whenever he did so his ears would flap out.Strongest Arm was very ugly even by mutant standards."You may have tim honour of tim sacrifice.May tim blessing of tim Holy Harp keep you in record."Longest beard then made the symbol of the harp across Strongest Arm and took a step back towards the congregation.Strongest Arm paused and examined the sacrifices.They cowered before him.One of them was crying and had pee'd all over his robes.One said nothing, merely eye balling the balding mutant and Longest Beard.Strongest Arm grabbed the crying one in his big oversized hand and raised him into the air by his head.He giggled stupidly as he crushed the mans skull in his hand.The congregation cheered.Longest Beard, raised his hands in exaltation.The body fell to the floor, still writhing.Strongest Arm wiped his hand on his robes and took a step towards the next sacrifice."STOP TIM SACRIFICE" There were sounds of surprise in the crowd as one from the back kicked and pushed his way to the front."What is tims meaning of this?"cried Longest Beard.The one who had stepped forward was Fastest Feet, a young whipper snapper, he had always protested the need for sacrifices.He was always the fastest runner in the tribe.On sports days he would always win the egg and spoon race."Stop.. tim.. sacrifice.." Fastest Feet stammered, out of breath."Yes we heard that," Said Longest Beard,"We want to know why.""I found it Longest Beard Old Father, I found it I did,"

"You found what?""The map Old Father, the map to the Guinness Factuary.""You found the..Map?!"Longest Beard quite rightly amazed nearly pulled his beard off in surprise.He had spent his whole life looking for knowledge about the Factuary of legend.The place where all Guinness records began."Holy Harp!Show it to me boy, show it to me now."Fastest Feet reached into the front pouch of his robe.He pulled out the map, it was an old Dublin City Bus Tours map from the before the Bombs.It had been preserved in the memory box of a family in Cork.Where it remained undisturbed for almost a hundred years until  it was discovered by Fastest Feet as he was scavenging the rubbles of yesteryear.Longest Beard snatched it from the boys hand.Excited he hurried over to the light of the nearby torches and examined the map."Yes..This is really real.Tims map.Tims map to tims factuary.Tims source."His eyes gleamed in the dull light of the cave."Very well.We tanks you Fastest Feet.You have Shirley done us a great service."Said Longest Beard raising the map above his head and addressing the congregation."This is tim map of tim holy harp, tim map of tim myth and legend.Now we can proven once and for all to tim Children of tim Red Bull, that tim Guinness is tim one true Fact Recorden."There were oohs and aahs from the congregation.The sacrifices looked on.One of them, eye balling one from earlier stood up."Ye Blasphemers, Ye can ne'er proven nothing.The Bull knows all truth.Ye are but charlatans and additives.Takers away from the truth of our cans.""-Strongest Arm will you?"Nodded Longest Beard, Stongest Arm stepped forward and grabbed the Blasphemer by the head raising him into the air.He screamed."No..!"protested Fastest Feet," Perhaps they can be saved!""What?"cried Longest Beard, incredulous," Impossible, no child has ever renounced their phoney Red Bull.Not even when submitted to all tim facts contained in the Books of Records.They still yet deny tim harp.""But if they see that tim Factuary is real.Once they see how all of these were made."Fastest Feet addressed the alter at the back of the cave.Arranged in order of year issued were twenty three unique copies of the Guinness Book of World records.The earliest dating back to 1977."They will have to believe.I propose we take these two with us to far off Dub Lin to tim Factuary.Where they will seen proof of tim Holy Harps.Then they will have to believe."Longest Beard thought about that for a while."Very well, what say you blasphemer?If we bring you and your kind to tim great factuary will you heed our righteousness and support tim holy harp?"Still held up by Strongest Arm in the air the Blasphemer kicked and punched the air around him."Never, I will never convert, you heathens will but in hell for your blasphemy whilst my people will sprout wings and fly-ighs-ahh-ahh!"He never got to finish his curse, one of his flailing kicks landed on Strongest Arms nose.That was the end of him."You see Fastest Feet, these people will never convert.They are too deluded.Come Strongest Arm, finish of tim last sacrifice that we may prepare tims great journey.""Sacrific-"

"Nooo!"Cried the last sacrifice; "I will come, I will see your factuary.If it does indeed convince me then i will Shirley convert."Longest Beards eyes gleamed in the dark.He grinned, "Very well.. but first a sacrifice."&#x200B;
