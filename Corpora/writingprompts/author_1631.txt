''Lets get out of here'' she said and I nodded back.A moments later I remember where we are going.There is a place full of old buildings... All the other people likes shiny and noisy places we are tend to go where we can listen different things.She looks more happy some reason.''Its been a long time since we visited this place.''I said.She didnt say anything...

Only different thing I can notice was the blinking light coming from far away.It would take hours to walk there and we just arrived this place.''You dont have to look there.''She said.''Where?''I asked.She came closer ''Do you know what day is this?''I was distracted.Not because of that blinking light also one of her shoe was missing.How she didnt notice that before?How I didnt notice that before...

''You are falling.''She said.Yes, I had a feeling like I was falling but it wasnt the bad feeling.It was interesting kind of a feeling.I grabbed a stone from the ground and I threw towards a metal junk that was stading right beside the broken wall.Noise that stone and metal junk made didnt sound right.''Oh, here is your missing shoe.''I find her shoe right next to stone that threw just now.As soon as I picked it up, I noticed there was some sort of liquid inside of a shoe.I turned it sideways and and blood spilled to ground and made a sound that like someone is crying.I turned my back and she was gone.She didnt say anything.SHE DIDNT SAY ANYHING!!!-----

It was dark.I felt awake but couldnt see anything.I tried to reach something and I touched a some sort of button.Then some alarm went off, it was very loud, disturbing.I couldnt scream, I couldnt talk, I couldnt move.When I was able to see I saw my father.She was looking behind a glass.Trying to tell me something.I turned my head to other side and I saw the VR that my parents gave me... Oh no.CANT BE!I was hearing mixed voice in my head.It was my sisters voice calling for my help...
