When I was 17 or so there was lots of hype about 'unlocking the secrets of immortality' something about dna or oxidation or something.I didn't really pay much attention.After all, how many 'health facts' lasted so much as a year before being changed for whatever reason?How many 'wonder drugs' that amounted to so much nothing?Then, nearly a decade later, they did it.12 liters of 7 different drugs, carefully administered over the course of a week, to stop age for eternity, to stall death as long as could be.The only side effect they found was infertility.A boon more than anything, considering overpopulation.Well, the government swooped down on that procedure faster than a bullet, and within the week rules had been placed.25~26.That was how old you had to be to take the procedure.No exceptions.After a while, those of us 27 or older started being called stuff like the 'old humanity' and 'final generation' and so on, while the younger ones, the ones who took the surgery where called the 'new generation'

When I was 47, the last child of the 'old generation' was born.When I was 72, she took the operation.It was the end of mankind as we knew it.A quiet, lonly end that few noticed and even fewer mourned.Then, when I 85, the side-effects, the *true* side effects of the operation was discovered.The operation had not made anyone infertile.Far from it.What had happened was simple.The stopping of aging had simply slowed the growth of the embryo, so slow that noone noticed.And by the time it grew big enough to discover, advances in medicine meant noone ever visited the hospitals.But as the embryo grew, it's development accelerated, and now a decade since the first pregnancy was confirmed, pregnancies where being reported from all around the world.It was on the news, even now.The first birth in nearly seventy years.I did not turn on the TV.My wife had passed two years ago, and I felt it my time coming.Whatever befell this generation of self-made immortals was their problem now.Not ours.But no matter what happened, one thing was certain.This new child to be born, they would truly be the new humanity.

Everyone had a rating for how lucky they could be, from 1 to 100, 1 being close to no luck and 100 being the best luck.Most people had a rating of around 30ish.I was one of the few with a full score of 100.Which would have been great, if bad luck wasn't a thing.The thing with the luck rating was that it was basically a rating on how much 'chance' would get fucked up around you.People with single digit luck could plan out their entire *year* and have not a single thing derail.Planning on a trip?Not a single random happenstance would occurre.No accidents, no sudden horrible weather, nothing.Those of us with 100?We could try to walk from our bedrooms to our bathrooms and end up going through two localized apocalypses, a kidnapping, and rescue an alien princess from an alternative dimension, then still make it to the restroom before it got too uncomfortable holding the piss in.We where literally walking time bomb of 'anything and everything' going off every other day.Which was why I was in prison.Though really, prison didn't even begin to describe this place.A box would be more appropriate.In fact, the place actually was a box.A box inside a box.Each inmate were placed inside a hollow metal cube three meters long on all sides, then the cubes themselves where stacked inside a bigger metal box, which in turn... well you got the idea.There was no vents, no electronics, nothing that could accidently go wrong or otherwise malfunction.Just solid metal covering solid metal.Which was to say, everything went wrong pretty much instantly.When they placed my box, the vibrations caused as they fit it in place resonated with my right wall and shattered it to bits.It's been a month after that.Two new inmates where added.Tom had a strawberry seed stuck in his shoe that sprouted and tore the top off his box, and Sharon just kinda fell out of the box.She hasn't been able to fall back into the box though, so she lives with Amy now.It's not a bad life.We have food(somehow) and water(for some reason), plenty of intertainment, and we don't end up screwing someone over because we're next to them.I don't think anyone really wants to leave, and frankly, neither do I.Knowing our luck, we'll probably end up going back out sooner or later... but until then, I think we're all content to stay here and relax.For now anyways.
