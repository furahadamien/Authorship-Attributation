The Timeless, the ones who took the drug disappeared.In a bright flash of light.No scientist could tell us why it happened or where they went but they were gone.The first time it happened a group of 10 of them went at once, blinded 4 people, the government of Paris, where it happened thought it was a terrorist attack.Then it happened again in Africa a governments official disappeared during a press conference, the another time in America the president's daughter just gone  this prompted an investigation and when it was discovered that it only happened to the Timeless chaos broke, millions disappeared in what we began to call Flashes.The world's government were near collapse before scientist administered a "cure".And for two more years nothing.In those two years archeologist discovered cellphones which appeared to have aged hundreds of years despite being of the present.More was discovered, articles of clothing and items that could only be from the current time.Science marveled at what was now the called "The Time Travel Drug" but the rest of the world was horrified.Scientist began to try and isolate why and how the drug was able to push people back in time, and in all respects they failed, but then some came back.In flashes just as bright as they where when they had gone exactly 1290 of them came back.Of the 1290 Returners about half of them had forgotten everything past the point of them disappearing, but the other half, they remembered everything.Of the original group of 10 that disappeared in Paris only one returned, the rest had died of the black plauge.The president's daughter returned but was horribly crippled, having lost an arm and foot in the American civil war.Scientist took the Returners in for testing and were finally able to recreate the conditions need time travel.Four years after the initial Flash science had discovered a way to control flashes in those who it had not happened to yet and those who it had.Every year we remember those lost to time and history.
