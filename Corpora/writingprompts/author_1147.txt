"What's this?"I asked as the giant man angel handed me a book."This is your life, as well as all the options you never took.We like to hand these out to the new people so they can see what would have come if they had made other choices in their life.""Huh, so kind of like that movie, 'It's a wonderful life'.Well, no thanks" I said as I handed the book back to the man angel."What do you mean?""Look, there are choices I made and didn't make.Some led to regrets and others not.My life choices were not about making the right ones, but being okay with the choices I made and being grateful for making my life the best I could in spite of my choices.""Are you not curious?""Hell no.Why would I want to see that if I had only asked out Barb in twelfth grade, my life would have bee so much better?Sounds like misery to me.""Yes but what of that outcome would have shown you how much worse your life would have been, and instead validates your choice to not ask her out?""Who cares?I know what I did and did not do and am happy with it.Are you gonna open these gates for me or do I have to climb over them?"The giant man angel smiled, turned to the side and the gates opened.
