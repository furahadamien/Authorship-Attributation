This strange thing with the "Magic #1 Dad mugs" left nothing but confusion and the bitter taste of sorrow in Russ's mouth.After all, with all his classmates alternatively bragging about or hiding their father's scores, what was he supposed to do?Though his mother had only ever brought it up a few times during his life, and he knew she loved him above all else, the words still burned in his mind and heart."Bastard.""Mistake."What did you do when you never had a father in the first place?What do you tell your best friend, proudly displaying their dad's mug that boldy proclaimed "Top 2% Dad" while you never had such a thing in the first place?How do you tell those with curious and confused stares that your father never even knew you existed?With every moment Russ's shame grew.He didn't dare give one of those damned mugs to his mother's husband, because despite the attempt to connect Russ knew that any rank shown would only shame his step-father.Days of confusion went by before his grandfather, his Bumpa, decided to drop by.A swarthy, stocky Arabic man full of good humor, love and joy, anyone who saw him with the tall, dour teen would never think that they were related.And in a way, they would be right.Though they would never be blood relations, Bumpa could never possibly be more dear to Russ's heart.Truly, this was a man worthy of praise and reverence.Even the squirming, shimmering letter on the large mug Russ presented to him one day agreed; "#1 Grandfather" only confirmed what Russ knew all along."So what if I have no father?'Mistake' and 'Bastard' I may be, but I'll be damned if that ever stops me from being as great as man and Father as my Bumpa is to me."Thanks for reading!I'm sure this is pretty subpar compared to just about every reply on this post, but reading through them really moved me down paths I haven't gone down in a while, and I just needed to pour it all out.
