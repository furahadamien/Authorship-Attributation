The traveller descends from his vessel... Mr. Hitler looking tired prepares himself to repeal yet another attempt on his life; As he pulls off his hood to reveal the frizzy afro of Bob Ross we see underneath an Asian guy looking a bit confused."Oh, there you are Adolf nice to meet you my name is Yun.""What's with the hair traveller?""This?Well it worked for the other guy and management is running out of ideas, they even sent me to teach you how to paint, can you believe it?""That's a new one."His personal guard entering the room as he speaks."I'm serious, I don't even carry any weapons.""Really?Then this is going to be quick.""Yeah I suppose, you see the last crazy idea management came up with was that you're actually a frustrated artist and that if we can get you to succeed then you won't be a problem for us in the future.""Careful choice of words, you've been trained well... not as well as the others.""..."

"I have a plan agent, I have a mission and a duty to me people, it is my fate and all of you coming here just reassures me that I'll succeed.""Yeah I know, I did my homework you're a psychopath and you've been planning this for years, long before your ascension."Something was wrong and he could feel it, besides the bizarre plan and the nonchalant attitude something was off, something...*else.*

"For what it's worth, I like your paintings."Said the agent as the others took him away."Did they really sent him to paint?"And then he fell, silent, dead on the floor... and so did his guard, his people and billions of others all across Europe.Yun fell too, victim of the biological weapon he carried on the paint and on his final moments he said "The was no other way, no other solution to put an end to this nightmare, this stain on history, this impurity that has plagued us for so long.""We did nothing wrong."
