"Get down!"I shout as a rocket-propelled grenade flies across the battlefield.Sergeant Tank leaps to the ground, her squad automatic weapon clanking against the battle-scarred rocks.Fragments of stone pepper my helmet when the rocket hits the granite hillside.I peek over the boulder I am crouched behind.Three insurgents hang out of a battered pickup truck.Two are brandishing automatic rifles, while the third works to reload his rocket launcher.A fourth man, a very nervous-looking insurgent with glasses, grips the steering wheel tightly as he maneuvers the truck into a u-turn.I suppose not everyone who fights this war is as excited as everyone else.Tank picks herself off the ground, her teeth grit.She growls as she swings her weapon over the boulder.She yells as she rains hot lead at the pickup.Indiscriminate hollering comes from.the truck as the scramble to duck back in.The one with the RPG is struck and falls out of the bed of the truck.He hits the ground and lies motionless.The tires of the truck spin in the loose desert dirt as the driver pulls the truck away from Tank's fury.A stream of bullets streaks across the driver's door, ending at the truck's front tire.It bursts from the onslaught and the driver loses control.He careens into a ditch, tossing his buddies like rag dolls.I take the opportunity."Go go go!"I command.Behind me, Private Kiddo, Private Steel, and Corporal Payne all charge toward the truck.With swift precision, we pick off the remaining two insurgents before they could react.We sweep around the vehicle, ensuring all hostiles are taken care of.I heard movement coming from the driver's seat.I pull the door open."Don't shoot!"cracks a timid voice.The driver is met with four M4 rifles pointed at his face.I reach in, grab him by the collar, and yank him out.He falls to his knees and starts to beg."Please don't kill me!"he whimpers.Tank walks up behind up, loading a new belt into her SAW.She pulls the charging handle and points her weapon at the fallen enemy."No!"I shout, pushing her weapon aside."Why?"Tank demands."He's useless.Just kill him and move on.""He could have information on the enemy," I explain."Let's take him back to base."Tank eyes him for a second, then spits and walks away.Kiddo and Steel grab the man, cuff him, and drag him back to the Humvee, while Payne and I cover the rear.When we get back to the Humvee, Kiddo and Steel climb into the back with our detainee, I take shotgun, Payne drives, and Tank sits in the back on lookout, weapon ready for anything.Along the way, I radio in our detainee.I am ordered to take him to our interrogation shed for questioning.I acknowledge the order and pass it along to Payne.He turns around and we drive a couple minutes to a small abandoned building.Payne parks behind some dead brush and we all climb out, detainee in tow.Tank and Payne provide cover while the rest of us guide the man into the building.I find a chair, sit him down, and begin to question him."What is your name?"I ask."Uh..." the man stammers.He eyes everyone around him nervously."Answer the damn question!"Tank shouts from her window post.I look at him insistantly.He gulps."They call me... Aloha Snackbar.""What the fuck?"Tank growls."That's not offensive at all."I ignore her."Where is your headquarters located?"I ask.The detainee shakes his head.I ask again.He still shakes his head."I can't!""You will tell us, or I'll unleash Tank on you," I say.I hear Tank crack her knuckles behind me."Incoming!"Payne shouts.I drop to the floor just as a rocket hits the wall of the building.A hole is blasted open, followed by small arms fire.Tank and Payne fire back, but Kiddo and Steel are down, dead.I pick my rifle up, push Aloha Snackbar against the opposite wall, and rush to find a good position.Bullets pepper the building as the insurgents rain hell upon us.Tank tries to return fire, spraying anywhere she can see enemies.As we return fire, I hear the back door get kicked open.I turn and begin to shoot at the door, but I do not see anyone.Next to me, I hear Tank groan, then silence as she falls to the floor, bleeding profusely.Then I see a small can roll across the floor, followed by a loud pop.My vision burns white from the flashbang, and my ears ring.Everything starts to streak white and black, my hearing turns to static, and suddenly, a sharp blow to the back of my head.*     *     *
