The Fae - the elfkin - have coveted our world for eons.Stories sneak through into human consciousness of their acts.The British had King Arthur, the seelie and unseelie.Australia has the mysterious Baijini - the white people from the North.Japan has the Kami.The Mayans had terrible twins and boys with antlers.These are folk memories of wars that pushed us to the edge of extinction writ large in the tapestry of human existence, permeating every culture and consciousness.We were trapped in pack ice, the ship's hull cracking as great forces moved, when they came.The expedition had been to find the North West Passage, and the captain had insisted that, with stars and providence - and one of Master Harrison's clocks - we would be the first to chart the route to the riches of the East.We all knew the risks; Hudson had not only failed, but failed and died.Nor had Cook succeeded.Yet we, in a fit of youthful folly and hope believed that the passage would be found.When the ship stopped and broke herself in the ice we furrowed brows knitted with ice.When the food and water ran low we looked at each other with wary eyes.And when the rum ration finished, the mutiny began.Nights in the north come long or quick depending on season; the bloody night seemed to last forever.The loyalists in the f'castle, the mutineers scurrying like rats across deck and rope to finish us off with shot or cutlass.Sixteen turned to six, turned to three and, as Midshipman Smollett choked his last, wheezing gasp, one.My shirt was coated with his blood, turned deep sanguine by his gizzards so that only a few cuffs and collars of white remained.By then dawn finally broke - not a true dawn, just an orange, permeating glow for we were too far North for the sun to rise - and I decided to accept my fate.I opened the barricades, walked past the splintered windows pock-marked from where leaden balls had flown, and decided to face the mutinous rabble.Only they weren't there.All that remained on the deck was silence and death.And a small figure, ears pointed like a pinecone, features cruel and barbarous.Quietly he looked at me, and I realised with horror he was gnawing on the bony hand - severed clean - of Samuel Saunders, one of the topmen, whose tattoos and curling hair I would have known anywhere.My revulsion must have been plain, for he dropped the limb onto the deck, and licked his vile lips with slow precision, a stream of gore giving sheen to his teeth."How now, traveler?"he asked."Methinks we have found a Santa Claus."
