**The gospel of Brad, Chapter 26, beginning at the 21st verse.(Taken from the *Revised* King James bible, containing *all 6* gospels)**


And as they did eat, he said, "Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me."And they were exceeding sorrowful, save for Chad who had "verily called it" to Brad a  near fortnight ago.After the thirteen had paid the bet in full, the lot began to say unto him, Lord, is it I?But, Brad then spake unto Chad, "I know not of the other bros, but twas not I, dude"

The lord interjected and spake, "He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me."Chad then said unto him, "Jesus, tis totally Judas"

And the lord did reply unto Chad, "No duh, Brad, weren't thou listening?"The lord continued, "The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!it had been good for that man if he had not been born.""Buuurrrn" spake Brad and Chad in unison.Then Judas, which betrayed the lord, answered and said, "Master, is it I?"He said unto him, "Thou hast said."Chad and Brad went bonkers crying, "oOOOoooHhhh!"and "Thou art so *reeeeckd!*"

And as they went on to eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is my body."Chad did doubt, and then spake, "Master, must thou makest it all weird like that?""Yea" spake the Lord "It is necessary".And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins."This time Bard didst speak up, "I thinkst I may hurl, if I imagine it so."And he spake again, "I verirly believe that thou hast had a little too much blood to drink, brah"

And so Lord the let ou a sigh and spake, "*Fine*, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."And when they had sung to a few jams, they reached for mount of Olives.Then saith Jesus unto them, "All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad."Brad spake unto him the Lord, "We hath scattered and shalt scatter again if thou makest us smell Simon's feet again like thou did earlier went thou washed them"

"Not like that," Jesus explained, "Thou shalt ditch me whilst I am crucified, but after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.Peter answered and said unto him, "Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.""What a rabbi's pet ..."did Chad whisper unto Brad.Then Jesus said unto Peter, "Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.""What sayest thou now suck up?"spake Chad unto Peter."ROoasst!"sayeth Brad, high-fiving Chad.Then saith Jesus unto Brad and Chad "Verily, if thou thinkst that's bad, ye need only wait to heareth thine own charges."Then the Lord proceedeth to scribble the charges of Brad in the sand.Brad did turn unto Chad and saith "Thou suckest, brah"

Then the Lord wrote the charges of Chad.Reading that for which Chad would be guilty that night, Brad saith in reply, "Nay, thou suckest more, dude"

For the two, there was much gnashing of teeth.The remaining twelve did snicker at their shenanigans.When the Lord had calmed them, the fourteen cometh with Jesus unto a place called Gethsemane, and he saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.I thinkst I shall pray for you guys for thou needst it more than I do"
