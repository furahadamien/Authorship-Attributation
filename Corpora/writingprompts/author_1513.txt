DuesCataclysmos
The accident had been terrible.A drunk driver in a new sports car who couldn't handle his vehicle hopped up the curb.A small group of people waiting for their bus.Multiple eye witnesses and a street cam watched Ed diving to shield a young girl with his body.Later that night, the girl was returned to her family and friends.Edward was surrounded by his in the ICU.Lacerations and black bruises were stark against his skin.The guy was already pretty pale normally, but then he had looked downright transparent.There was a red stump where his crushed and mangled arm used to be.I honestly thought my friend was going to die.But, slowly, he recovered.Physically he was still very weak, but eventually Ed's mind was back to usual.When he was moved out of ICU we could have longer visits, so I brought books for him to read and played an occasional game of chess.Amputated arm excluded, he lost a great deal of weight during his stay and was surprisingly keen to keep it down.I guess a brush with death changed his perspective a bit.The same appeared to be true for his mother and father.After it was clear he wasn't going to college like the rest of our little gang, they were strongly "encouraging" him to find swift employment and swifter eviction - sometimes with threats involving a pressure washer.Now, they were absolutely aghast at the thought of turning out their disabled son and local hero.A year or so after his release, we began to joke about the incident with him.Between the disability benefits, his parent's newfound hospitality, and a *very* lucrative civil suit, it was decided that Edward had sacrificed his dominant arm (the vice-grip for his two greatest vices: video games and masturbation) to Lucifer in exchange for the life of idleness and sloth he always wanted.So, imagine our shock when Ed invited us all down to his "basement suite" one Saturday afternoon, saying he was going to tell us about his plans to move out of his parent's house - and the new job that afforded it.Ed's basement was a Stoner Shangri-La.Comics, manga, consoles, computers, posters, television, fully stocked fridge, and a music collection that spanned three generations of his family and six different formats.There was even a treadmill and modest weight-lifting setup in the corner, a gift from his parents to support his physical rehabilitation and health efforts.All that was missing were the stacks of vintage Playboy magazines, which Edward had long ago dutifully scanned and transfered onto a flash drive which he copied and discretely distributed to David and I.As we seated ourselves on the giant well-worn couch, he dimmed the lights and grabbed the remote for the TV.Apparently there was going to be a presentation.An image of a chubby white ghost, barred behind the international prohibition symbol, appeared on screen.'**Ghost Busting**' said Ed, gesturing with 1/2 jazz hands.'**Idiot**' said Jordan, doing jazz hands herself.He shook his head slowly and chuckled deeply, prolonged and fake, like she was slow learning.Ed knew Jordan was far more intelligent than he was, but he had also been studying how to annoy her since elementary school.He moved behind the TV, and pulled up a long white sheet sewn to a pillow case with two eye holes cut out.A makeshift cape and cowl.'I'm going to become a ghost-themed super hero, who fights other ghosts.Like a Danny Phantom type deal, except I want to get paid and my mom doesn't have a huge perfect ass.'He raised up his good arm and stump.'How do I look?'David laughed.'Like you want to lynch me, but also have to ask for my help tying the slipknot.'He pulled out a black sharpie from his pocket, and drew a big sloppy Smiley Face ^tm smile across Ed's cowl.'There, that takes some of the edge off.Kid friendly.''Ok, ok, now I'll need a ghost-themed super hero name for myself.How about Phantom Limb?''You know that's already taken.'I said.'Yeah, but Venture Bros goes on hiatus for so damn long I think they might lose the trademark.What about "the Ghost Gimp?"'Jordan rose from the couch.'If this is what you called us here for Ed, I have better shit to do.Some of us, and by that I mean everyone here but you, has something they could be studying.''Wait!Wait!Study this shit!'He hovered his stump limb over the TV, and it suddenly erupted in a violent scream of static noise.A black transparent arm, like an x-ray scan, appeared amongst the static.It began to flex and gyrate, moving in sync with Edward's body, seemingly affixed to his stump.David laughed again.'Dude, nice try, but that TV is digital.My fucking grandpa doesn't even use analog anymore.''I know, it's spooky that way isn't it?'He stepped away, and the picture returned to the Ghostbuster's logo.'Look, if you really don't believe me, hit the blacklight.''Oh God, please no' Jordan cried as she made a desperate move for the door.'Shut up, just do it.'Thankfully, no mysterious stains appeared.Unthankfully, Ed's missing arm was now completely visible.More than visible, it was a see-through network of muscle, bone, and vein glowing in the darkness.He walked over to me and placed his spectral hand on my chest, IN my chest, and an ice-cold sensation raced up my spine.He pulled back his hood, and flashed a goofy grin as he withdrew his arm.'Believe me now, fuckers?My bad-ass life-saving ghost bustin' career has only just begun, and you nerds are gonna help me.'
