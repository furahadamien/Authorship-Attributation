You'll never guess what happened to me bro!I was at an alley and a man draws a gun, asks me for my wallet.I obey.He throws it on the ground starts shooting and screeches and tell me i am safe.No way bro!What did you do?I ask the guy, why the f did you do that for?!He, i kid you not, turns to me and says: Mimics.I laugh,  he laughs and the trash bin starts laughing too.I erase the beast with my shotgun.Give a 5 to the man and tell him to take care.Hahah nice one bro.Those guys are crazy.Ill give you a new wallet next birthday.
