Three years ago, I got into a car accident.A drunk driver hit our car on the freeway.My injuries were so severe that they had to amputate my left arm, right above the elbow.Came out of a coma finding my left arm gone, though I could still feel it.My hand felt as if it was still gripping the steering wheel.I could still feel my wedding ring on my finger.Then my world came crashing down as the doctor told me my wife, who was in the car with me, did not make it.When were found by police, they said she was dead at the scene.They rushed her to the hospital but they couldn't save the baby.My wife and I had been married for three years.She was seven months pregnant when she died.We were going to name him Ned after my father but all of it ended that night.The cliche statement to say that I was lost would be an understatement.I was dead.I was dead but walking.I was dead but still eating.I was dead by I would still shower, still shave, still wake up every morning.Don't get me wrong, there were days where I didn't get out of bed or at least whole mornings where I would lay there and just try to will my body to die.But a part of me, her voice in my head really, would tell me to get up, to get ready, to do more because she would be disappointed.It got really bad though.When the mornings in bed were more frequent and when her voice was harder to hear, I found myself reaching out to a place I never expected to find help, church.I was raised catholic but was never very spiritual.The parish Priest, Father Francisco, was there he first day I set foot in the church.He has been there for me ever since.We actually became quick friends.One day, months after we met and became friends, I received a panicked call from Father Frank.He said he was in desperate need of a ride, of all things, and he knew I lived close to the church.When I picked him up, he was decked out in his priestly garb but looked terrified.I asked if he was alright but he just gave told me to drive and threw his phone with the maps plugged in and the GPS barking directions.After a few minutes into the quiet drive, I probed again, this time he responded."Do you believe in God Mikeymcmikerson?"I responded as I always do to that question, with a simple, "I don't really know."Father Frank said, "Its not that simple as theology makes it seem.The implications of the faith are wide and deep and sometimes dark.If you believe in God, then you believe in the bible.This book," he said waving his bible, "is full of wonderful things, But if you believe it true, then so is the evil in this book."When we arrived at the home, Father Frank told me to stay in the car and wait for him.The look on his face was a look I had seen many times when I was in the marines, his face was stern, his jaw set, but his eyes betrayed him, thats where I saw the fear.It looked as if Father Frank was about to go into combat.I sat in the car, confused over the exchange.I hated the idle time because that left time for my mind to wander and when it does it goes to dark places.I got out of the car and decided to walk around a bit.The house we were at was part of what looked like a new subdivision, no mature trees were seen everywhere and the sun was high and hot making the lack of shade even more obvious.I considered walking around the block but then I heard it, Father Frank screaming for his life.Without a second thought, I ran into the house.Bursting through the front door, I saw in the living room father Frank his back against the wall, his feet off the floor and nothing holding him up.An older hispanic woman was at the other end of the room crying, clutching her rosary.I ran to father Frank to try and grab him and pull him off the wall.I ran to him with both arms out, forgetting my left arm gone, but when I got in front of Father Frank, I felt my left arm hit something.No, not my left arm, my left hand, I felt my left hand really couch something warm and it wasn't father Frank.I will continue more tomorrow.
