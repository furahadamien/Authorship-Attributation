It began with a first strike nuclear attack on North Korea and their immediately retaliation.Guam and Hawaii were obliterated but Alaska was spared as the missile sent towards it simply failed and dropped into the North Pacific.Fortunately, for the United States at least, none of North Koreas missiles had the range to reach the continent.This initial exchange set in place the chain of events that weve come to know as World War III as existing alliances and allegiances were brought to play and sides were chosen.Fortunately, the this was the only time nuclear weapons were used in the conflict.President Trump would later say that the initial strike had been an accident and that the war that followed wasnt his fault.Any statements to the contrary were simply Fake News!
	The Great Accord as it became known was settled that fall in Ottawa.Each country would agree to maintaining isolation for a period of fifty years.The citizens of each country would be required to stay within the current physical boundaries of their countries.Internet service would be firewalled and contained within those same geographical regions.Agreement was nearly unanimous although there were a number of concessions made before the accord was signed by all nations.The strictest concessions came from America itself which demanded that an agreement alone was not sufficient to enforce this.Physical deterrence was required as well.They insisted that the borders be enforced through impenetrable walls, automated weapons systems, and EMF jammers.As the Greatest Country On Earth, America demanded that they be the first to have these measures put into place.The walls were the most complicated and astounding pieces of engineering ever created.They were over 50 feet tall, 10 feet wide and covered the Northern and Southern borders from sea to sea.Built to withstand natural and manmade disasters for at least a century they were practically indestructible.Ocean platforms with the same weapons and jamming systems were placed out to the edge of international waters, a wall being completely impractical in that environment.When they were finally completed on August 23, 2025 America was separated from the rest of the world in every practical way.Enforcement of The Great Accord was an international effort and the building of these walls took up a significant portion of the funding the member countries had allotted for that purpose.By the time the job was completed the member countries began to question if these walls were even necessary.After all, how would America know that they hadnt gone through with it?Besides, they were the only ones to really wanted these walls in the first place.It was this line of questioning that led to a revised version of The Great Accord stripping out the walls and relaxing a great many of the restrictions that had been put initially into place.Within a decade The Great Accord had been abolished completely and normal trade and relations resumed.Only America remained isolated, hidden behind its massive walls.The world slowly returned to normalcy, as the balance of power shifted to account for a world without America.In its absence, China took its place as the economic, military, and social power.Mandarin became the new language of international trade, business, and science.The shift to Easternization came slowly but certainly as eastern culture and ideas predominated along with the language.Like most change, this was met with resistance.This resistance turned into strife and in time war.China and the European Union clashed in a war that made the last seem like a childs game.When the dust had settled only China and Russia remained with control all of the countries of the world split between them.Only America remained isolated, hidden behind its massive walls.When August 23rd 2075 arrived, the world had all but forgotten that America even existed.The walls had just been such a normal part of life that  and  just took them for granted.At exactly 11:13AM MDT the massive metal gates located on the northern end of the Bridge of the Americas creaked open.Just inside the gates a lone figure sits on a lawn chair with a beach umbrella protecting him from the midday sun.A podium sits a dozen feet in front of him.He sips from a glass of cold lemonade as he waits for the inevitable media flurry.He doesnt need to wait long as police and reporters throughout town rush to the gate.!!! they cry out as the figure waits until a sizable crowd has gathered.He steps up to a podium and begins to speak.I apologize but I dont speak Mexican.Anyways, I may not be president anymore but Im still Trump.And Ive got something I need to get off my chest. He stops to look over the audience and make eye contact with the camera with the best angle.I told you, youd pay for it.
