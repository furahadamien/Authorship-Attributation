With the tome of an infernal wisdom in my hand I chanted the words "Ooh ee ooh ah ah Ting Tang Walla!Walla!Bing!BANG!!!!"and with a puff of smoke his face appeared in my cauldron his hair was golden but dirtied by a slight tint of filth his skin pale white like the light of the sun."Hello this is Satan deceiver of men, defiler of gods plan.How can I help you?""Hey Luke it's Becky, and I need to ask something.What the hell Luke?!I've been your loyal servant for my entire life and you pull this shit?"I said tapping my foot with a bit of embellishment so he could see the bobbing of my head."Becky?Why are you so pissed?I got Sally what she wanted, I mean I know it's not exactly condo safe, but it's not going to hurt her.Also I sent you some of those lemon squares you were asking about" the pale man replied his brow furrowing at the seeming lack of thankfulness."The lemon squares were delicious!and one day you need to give me the recipe!"I said trying to stay angry when I thought of the ambrosia that was Hells lemon squares 

"But that's not the point right now!Do you think I've got the resources to take care of a horse right now?I told her to write to Santa because you and I both know the old fart can only deliver living things that can fit in a 2 foot by 2 foot box!I figured he'd just give her a puppy or an iguana, Shit I can handle!Now that this pony's here it's not like I can say, 'Okay dear I know you love Buttercup but we need to send her back'" I said sighing leaning on my elbows over the cauldron."I...I know you didn't do it on purpose, I should have checked the spelling better, but now I have to deal with stable rentals, feeding and care costs, riding lessons or else Sally's going to hate me."I said unable to stay angry at my eternal master as he got a strange look on his face one of surprise and a bit annoyed."Rebecca did you read my card?"he said his tone like that of a father to his daughter.I blushed "Well...no...who reads cards nowadays?"I said my eyes drifting off to the side.My master sighed "Go get the card Rebecca" he said flatly as I nodded sheepishly, heading back to where I left the package and grabbed the card still in it's blood red envelope taking it back to the cauldron"Open it."he said with the commanding tone that made me tremble.I carefully opened the envelop looking at the front which had a picture of a two elves a carrying a huge burdensome sack towards a sleigh with the text 'Sometimes around the holidays you can feel like the worlds put too much on your shoulders' I opened the card and inside the same two elves were now carrying individual pillars engraved with their sins with the text 'But it's a Hell of a lot better than the alternative -Happy Holidays to you and yours'

I laughed prompting my master to say "Read the message at the bottom aloud."his eyes a bit narrow as I nodded reading a message written a crimson ink "Dear Rebecca, for your loyal years of service please allow me to repay you slightly with first the lemon squares you love so dearly and second a portable hell steed..." I paused my face turning red as a tomato but I soldiered on 

"...for your daughter Sally.I received her letter, and I figured this would be the easiest option for you.To turn it into it's more portable shape simply squeeze the snout twice.May you and Sally have a Merry Christmas, Love Lucifer 'Luke' " I said dragging out the last sentence hoping by some chance of fate it could last longer the embarrassment palpable.The dark lord continued to glare at me "Well what do you have to say?"he said looking me straight in the eyes, staring into my twisted soul "I'm sowwy" I said trying to act cute but the glare continued as I seized up for a moment before bowing "This humble servant apologizes, Oh lord of sin, if I have displeased you I shall sacrifice myself in hopes to gain your forgiveness and favor" I said grabbing the ceremonial dagger holding it to my throat a few red drops dripping into the cauldron.The pale man looked contemplative "Hmm maybe you should, you were quite disrespectful" he said as I balked "Really Luke?Suicide for not reading a card?""Maybe" he said with an impish smile.I sighed "Fine, oh great lord please accept my sacrifice"I said sarcastically as I started to pull the blade, but as expected it dissipated from my hands, appearing in his."I'll forgive you this once, but start reading cards.It's rude not to at least take a quick peek.Didn't your mother ever teach you that?"he asked shaking the tip of the dagger toward my direction

"No my mother was too busy teaching me to love Satan, I suppose the lesson took too well" I said flatly looking away but a slight smile showed on the edge of my lips."I suppose so" he said chuckling "So did Sally like the pony?I chose the best colt in my stables."I smiled rolling my eyes "Yes your daughter loves her new pony, is that what you wanted to hear?"I said barely holding back a laugh as his face lit up "But next time tell me about these things, I think Old Lady Gibson next door had a heart attack when it lit her bushes on fire."I said smirking

Luke groaned "Don't remind me, the old bitch has been complaining nonstop since she got here.'It's too hot' 'Where's my tea' 'What do you mean killing abortion doctors don't get you to heaven?', Just bitch, bitch, bitch."he said looking over his shoulder "Well I need to get going tell Sally I'm glad she likes her present"

"Will do, I'll also make sure to sacrifice a couple lambs later.I know you prefer that to virgin.I love you Luke, Give em hell today" I said giggling as he his eyes rolled so hard they nearly left his skull "Every call you have to end with that" he said but smiled "Love you too, let me know if the Buttercup burns anything else, I'll make sure one of my constituents sends you a check" he said the cauldrons surface going murky.I giggled "That man, always spoiling his little Antichrist" I said softly to myself as I went to go find Sally and Buttercup.I needed to make sure I taught her how to stow her new horse away, I doubt the school would be pleased if she started riding it to school.

One day at age twelve I started to see the lines.At the school dance 2 girls asked me to dance May and Lisa.The green one lead to May,known for being rough basket case and Lisa the pastors daughter.I followed the green line because Green was my favorite color and let my friend Bobby dance with Lisa.My time with May was amazing, we loved similar things and the things she brought into my life only enhanced it.Lisa it turned out had been a compulsive liar and last I heard from her was the invitation to a shotgun marriage to Bobby who had been assured she was on the pill.From that day on I always followed the green line.Down any street, through any building and to any person it seemed to point, and every time it's brought me nothing but joy.However it had been 10 years since the dance and...well...life had gotten boring.Not to say it's been unpleasant, oh no!Every day is pleasant it's wonderful.I succeed in every undertaking and gain every chance I need.The guidance the green line has given me is invaluable, but there are no surprises anymore.So that's why today I had decided to follow the red line.I figured even if it lead me into a jam the green line could lead me back out.I was on my guard keeping an eye out for danger.In fact I had my eyes everywhere except for right in front of me, which is why I ran head long into a fire escape ladder.I woke up hours later in the hospital.The doctor said I only had a slight concussion, but I knew how much damage I truly had when I opened my eyes.The lines were gone.I don't know why they chose now to disappear, if they had always been delusions, but they were gone.For a moment, I felt this intense joy.The world had suddenly become vast and unpredictable like a brand new adventure had started, but that feeling quickly vanished.The nurse had asked a benign question "Jello or Brownie?"but as I stared at the choices a sense of dread came over me a paranoia created from years of following something else that might never come back.Which would I like more?Would one make make me sick?What if I'm allergic to one of them?I've never had to worry about allergies before!It was than I realized how much of a mistake I had made.I had never made a choice for myself since I was 12 years old.Even small ones like this felt like insurmountable obstacles.So now I set here staring at 2 sugary treats and wonder what will become of me.What will the future hold?How will I live without my guide?Can I live without it?Please, someone please tell me.
