Life stories

As my vision faded of my grieve stricken family, a new image steadily came into view.A library, one with shelves that seemed to go on endlessly into the abyss.There were faint images of people reading books and walking around, but all was silent.Suddenly a booming voice uttered one word, read.A book floated out of the abyss of selves with my name as the title.It contained every minute detail of every second of my life.A lot of it bored me, but when it got to those big moments in my life I felt a rising feeling, happiness.As I read on, I noticed footnotes of the strangers I passed.Eventually curiosity overcame me and proceeded to read one of these strangers life stories.What was a brief sentence of me walking past them, was a whole chapter in theirs.I had reminded him of his son and it got him thinking about life.He was going to kill himself that day, but after seeing me he realized that he had something to live for, family.Its weird how such a insignificant moment, something so minute, have such a impactful effect.Goes to show that the human race isnt so small and insignificant as it seems. Said the booming voice, closing the book of his story, to his newly joined family
