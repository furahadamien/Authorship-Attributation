8 times they've locked me up and thrown away the key.8 times i've broken out of whatever cell they make for me.20

20 times now have we met

20 bodies I have left.I am John Reyes and I am a killer.I order another scotch, the bartender slides one over.He's too scared to hand it to me, I can tell.Foots steps behind me, heavy, leaden.An old friend."Zachariah, hear to talk or do you have something you need done" I say without looking up

"Chupacabra, you know the rules.Here I am Tyrano."I hate the name Chupacabra.Zach sits down next to me.he is a mountain of muscle and scars.The exact kind of look you'd expect from a mob enforcer, not the don himself.He sits down next to me, like a lumbering jackass."Heard you had another encounter with the Breakers.who'd you kill this time.""Madame Mythical" I wave for another scotch 

"Damn shame, she was the hot one"

"6/10" Zach gives a stifled cough."I'm not here for idle chit chat anyway.""good.""Hangedman is out for blood, your specifically."I order another scotch."anyway man if you need some protection I still owe you a favor for incredible man.""Where is he now.""last i heard he was patrolling 5th."I get up from my seat and walk out the bar.It was a rainy night.the streets reeked  of wet human rot.The street wasn't that busy tonight, Tuesday.I walk into a liquor store and grab a bottle of scotch.The guy at the register says nothing as I leave.I keep walking by the time I find who i'm looking for my bottle is already empty.He doesn't notice me.In one movement i rush forward throwing the empty bottle into the back of his head.IT smashes apart and cuts his mask.Before he can turn around I pull out my knife and complete the cut on his mask.blond hair, neatly combed.He spins around and cracks my rib with his fist.I go flying into a wall.Another 2 breaks."You!"his mask falls off his face.mid 30's, brown eyes.Square jaw.He walks over and picks me up with his left arm."I'll kill you!"I stab him in the tricep and cut down to his elbow before he can drop me."No you won't" I say between coughs.He goes in for a right.I dodge around it and stab him in the eye.he scream out in pain."They say your immortal."I stab him in his gut and push him down.I slam my foot on his neck."But everyone dies."I cut and cut and cut.he keeps try to get back up but I just stab him again when he does.by the time that he's more mess than body I stand up to admire my work."why..." he says with his jaw not sliced in half.I must say I am quite impressed.as I begin to crouch down again i say to him."Because no one will stop me."I keep cutting and slicing.I'm not sure how much I have to cut him before he dies.But he will die.I lost track of time.I lost sense of place.and I didn't come back until I felt a car slamming into the back of my head."Beware villain, Power is here!"I see who threw the car.A 6'8'' dumbass made of muscle and drivel.In  a single bound he cut the entire distance between us.I go to stab at him but he is prepared for it.My head goes slamming into the mush that was once hangedman, maybe it still is."You are going to go away for a long time villain."He picks me up and locks my arms into chains.He's fast, maybe even as fast as me.I'll note this for later."I've broken out 9 times before, whats different now."It doesn't take long for him to get me back to the police station.And it doesn't take that long for them to throw me back in solitary confinement.&#x200B;

I'm gone now, but i'll be back, because i always comeback.
