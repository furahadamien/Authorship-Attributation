Roger furrowed his brow and put his sweaty, clammy hands on his forehead, his elbows on his knees.The plastic and cloth seat beneath him had finally warmed and become comfortable, as the seat next to him felt cold, its occupant having just left.Her navy peacoat flailed slightly as she buttoned the double breasts and walked down the four steps off the bus leading to the curb.The doors closed, and the seat beside Roger became colder.The navy peacoat drifted out of sight.He loosened his tie, rubbed his hands on his pants, and let his mind slip into a deep, empty, trance.What had transpired minutes before was painful, and a wound this fresh cannot be ignored, moved past, or relived without more pain.The woman he loved, the woman he had spent the past five years of his life trying to re-connect with, had just walked out on him for the sixth time.Each instance of "Roger" had failed to capture her interest for more than a year, and almost all had failed before the first date.This wound was deeper than all previous ones, and would likely not heal.Yes, this would be Roger's last attempt, as the woman he loved and who had once loved him had grown and changed so much that he felt he no longer knew her.The first incantations of Roger were not quite what he could consider to be "Roger", but what he considered to be better versions.Better hair.Better Muscles.Better smile.But alas, each version became more and more like the real Roger, and each one coming that much closer than its predecessor to connecting with her.Roger in his current form was the real "Roger" in almost every way, and is what made this wound so deep."This will be the last time I try," he decides."I must accept that my widowed wife no longer loves me."
