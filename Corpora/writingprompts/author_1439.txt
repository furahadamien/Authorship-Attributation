Long regarded as the oldest of the four Gospels and the primary source of Matthew and Luke, the Gospel According to Mark is traditionally considered to be the work of a disciple of the Apostle Peter.In a recent find, biblical scholars have found a much older version of the book (circa 62 CE) that has caused quite a controversy.The book includes mention of two additional disciples that were removed in later redactions, as well as Peter's standing in Jesus' ministry (italics indicate removed text):

"And [Jesus] said, So is the Kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; *And Brad chortled, for he thought his lord spoke of a man actually fucking the ground.And Jesus and the thirteen laughed when they actually thought about it, all but for Peter, for 'he had a stick up his end' that not even his master could cure.*"

And [Jesus] called unto him the *fourteen* and began to send them forth by two and two...And they went out, and preached that men should repent.*And Brad and Chad, remembering their fraternity days, created a rush week, preaching repentance to hundreds through killer parties of wine, tailgaiting, and fraternity-sorority mixers.And all were pleased, until Peter, in whose home the Psi Phi brothers had hosted their 'ministry,' returned; and his anger waxed hot against the brothers, as there was no more of his wine, nor his food, his home a mess, and a guy named Jerry who refused to leave Peter's sofa from then on."*

"And Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew tables of the moneychangers.*And Chad and Brad joined him, until they overturned the table belonging to a Jeffe the Bearded, who was feared throughout Jerusalem.And upon returning to see his table overturned, Jeffe and his men approached the disciples, saying, Who is he that overturns my table?And they all pointed to Peter, for he was the suckup who demanded to be in charge of the disciples in absence of Jesus.So Peter paid their fine, and demanded repayment for this and his house, to which the brothers agreed to do when the kingdom of God had come, which was 'certain to be soon(ish).'*"

And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he said to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.And he taketh with him Peter, and James and John *and Brad and Chad*...And [Jesus] cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, why sleepest though?*And what in my name is on your forehead?And Peter wiped his brow, and behold, it was a dickbutt.And James and John and Brad and Chad and Jesus laughed, until Peter's anger boiled over.For I had had it up to here with those two slackers' bullshit, and I swear I will go to my grave before I let myself be overshadowed like this again by some upstart apostles."*

Traditionalists are holding that these findings are a fraudulent attack on Peter's character and the Gospel of Mark as his sock puppet.However, others theorize this could explain Paul's "colorful" description of Peter as "dickbutt" redacted out of the account of the two's conflict in Galatians.
