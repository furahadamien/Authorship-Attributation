When i was at college someone stole 10 bucks from me at a party one time, I sorta knew the guy but not to much but he had a very distinct look.The area where my dorm was a fairly bad area for crime so i thought it might of amde a mistake but after talking to a few people i found it that it was this guy but noone really knew him.Although i only saw him once or twice after that.I've always felt determined to get some payback.Never really had anytime to act on any of it but with this inheritance I've got from my old grand pops I came up with a brilliant idea.I still can't believe the old cook left me this, i guess he didn't want it going to his kids since they tried to rip him off at every turn, he left me $50,000 and box of his crap.First I hired private investigator that set me back $10,000 in start up costs, i then paid him another $20,000 to keep tabs on him for 4 months.During this time he documented his routine, his hobbies and interests, who he talks to and he doesn't like, hell even what brand of conditioner he used in that rat nests he calls a haircut.When when he had enough intel, i brought in the hitman, Now these guys don't come cheap and i wanted it done right, so i found one on the dark web from a library computer (Using grand pops library card i found in a wallet from his box of crap) Checking over my shoulder every couple of seconds I managed to find a professional and all for the low low price of 25,000.Half before the job and the rest when it was done.I arranged a meet with my PI and Gun for hire to discuss the target and plan out when would be the best time to "whack" him.I gave the go ahead, the date was set.9th March.Two weeks away.I went about business as usual but took the day off that day.That way i could transfer the rest of the money straight away and not get on the bad side of an professional assassin.I waited around all day...still nothing but then late into the evening i get a text: "It's done".I call my PI to confirm it and everything checks out.I transfer the rest of the money and say goodbye formalities.The next day was saturday so I decided to check the news, not expecting to see anything straight away due to general news coverage doesn't really extensively cover members of the public death.But when i turned on the TV and changed to the news the first thing i see is a familiar face with the caption: "Biggie Smalls Shot Dead".
