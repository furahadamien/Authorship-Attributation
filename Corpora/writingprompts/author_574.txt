There's a fault in every system, they say.Granted, that fault's usually human error, but - well, a fault's a fault.What I mean to say is, any system can be gamed.And the newer, the better - it takes awhile to fix the zero-day faults, and they're always the most fun to crack into.So, the dad hierarchy was a natural target for me.At first glance it really didn't seem worthwhile - but, well, then I got to thinking.Parents, y'see, get a free pass for almost anything.It's wired into us biologically, y'see, to look up to the successful breeders.And to be high-ranked, maybe even number one?Shit, the lucky asshole whose kids thought the sun shone out his ass the most would be rich as fuck in weeks - can you _imagine_ all the endorsements from the kid-product-related companies?Like writing a blank check.Now granted, it looked like this was gonna be the long con - the kid apparently had to either be yours biologically or _think_ it was, so I was gonna have to bite the bullet and get laid, then stick around for a year minimum while the little shit grew.Here's where the gaming part comes in.I hate kids.Fuckin' loathe 'em, shitty little maggots, but - well, you remember what I said about zero day faults?Let me lay a truth on you about it, 'cause I just found this one out.Your ranking gets made permanent if your kid dies.So, yeah - come next year, I'm gonna be fuckin' loaded.Til then, all I gotta do is find the right bitch to breed, and hope she's carryin' the gene for childhood leukemia.
