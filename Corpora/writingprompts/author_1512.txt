My mom was always a very religious woman, I was never much the god type, but she was.She always respected my belief, to not believe in a god.I respected her more than her sisters for not putting others down for their views.She was the one who showed me what empathy was, and not just the massive amount of empathy that we call a mothers love.But showed me what it meant to be empathetic to others.Although I found she could be too empathetic at times to her own detriment.I feel like she never forgave herself for what happened at my birth."Pregnancy is a scary thing".Is the first thing I remember her telling me about myself.Creating life was the only miracle I think she believed in.After I was maimed, I don't think she could forgive herself for harming life in such a major way."I still have nightmares of you feeling pain in my belly, The pain I felt for you in that dream is enough to keep me up at night" Is what I would later find written in a calm handwriting in the notes section of my birth month.I Always hoped that when she died, she was able to let go of the guilt she felt.and now I know she did.......I got up and put my hand on the back of my neck to stretch...I had never done that before in my life.but it felt like a small wind storm on my skin that got excessively intense the more I pushed down on my skin until I was moving my head out of the way...I stopped for a moment before allowing my self to indulge in the idea that my forearm and hand was back.But I quickly snapped arm forward, to reveal a whirlpool pattern across my forearm and hand.I was amazed and shook, So much so that I thought I must be in a lucid dream.For a long time, the one thing I wanted more than anything was my arm back.And now I got it?It must be a dream and now I'm lucid... makes sense.I moved my new found arm close to see what my dream mind made my arm out of.but every time my eyes focused on a whirlpool, the whirlpools just got deeper and deeper it felt like my eyes were falling into the pools one after another until everything other than the pools faded out of sight.And I hear a voice that I haven't heard in years...my mothers...I can't rationalize it but I don't know what she said, Just the memory of her voice flooded my body, culminating in my arm.It was understanding, It was bliss.Then my kids hugged my legs, and my attention snapped to the kids...." is this, not a dream?"as the kids start to call for their dad, tugging at his shit.I  try and pick them both up, but my arm goes right through Milly on the right.My whirlpool arm passed right through her.I could only pick up Jessy on my left.As to not freak out the kids I decided to keep this to myself....not that they would understand at 5 years old.Our daily routine was oatmeal in the mornings, so I take them to the kitchen for breakfast.My brain is spinning with what I just experienced, as I notice the same whirlpools moving on my kid's shoulder I tried to brush them off with my left hand, but it went right through, but as my hand went through it, I felt a little bit of that understanding from before.for a second, I looked down at my hand to see the same whirlpools taking the form of my arm.I slowly moved my hand over the pools on my kids' shirt.Turning my hand over the pools turned into the shape of a type of a bug.being as I am not a "bug person" tossed it into the air a foot to two and punched it.It within a foot of leaving my fist it disappeared.and my daughter looked at me and said " I feel better".and that wave of understanding filled me even more.and I heard my mothers voice again, there was no pain, or guilt in her voice... Just empathy.Now I see bugs on everyone, and every time I punch them with my, what I like to call "my ghost arm" they vanish, and for the most part, people seem to feel better, or lighter on their feet when I destroy their bug.I have never told anyone about my new "ghost arm" but it has given me the power to help people..... and kill a bunch of Grosse bugs.
