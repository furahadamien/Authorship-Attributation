IncandenzaHimself
It started, as it usually did, when I woke up in the morning.I rolled over in my bed and hit the STOP button on my phone to stop the alarm.Id snoozed it three times already, but by the last time I could already hear some shouting and blaring outside my window.CLYDE.CLYDE.STOP IT NOW CLYDE.

It was a megaphone attached to their van, pointed directly at my bedroom window.They knew which window was my bedroom.They had figured it out weeks ago, even after Id switched from the main bedroom to the guest.It was their job to know these things.I got downstairs by the time the main one of the two of them, Peter, was peering into the window by the front door, to see what state I was in.He had a number of tactics at his disposal.I started my tea kettle and could hear a light rain outside.Itd rained buckets the night before, and this was just a holdover seemingly.But there was an accompanying thumph alongside the pattering on the outside awning.Peter had taken out the sign, a laminated one from his package of different messaging signs, and was tapping it against the window in a mostly uniform fashion.He stared intently at me as he did this.This was his job, anyway.By the time I got off the bullet train in Portland, I could tell today would be a particularly bad one.My train car had had wall-to-wall advertisements with my face plastered on them.The dozen or so morning commuters all had their moments of realizing, looking at my face and then back to the ads, then back to my face.They all developed the same looks: not disgust, but a mixture of curiosity and alienation.I was a freak, a relic, a thing to pity, all wrapped up in the same person.The young Asian woman who sat across from me kept eying my bag and my jacket, no doubt wondering where I kept it.The walk from the train to my office on East Jackson Avenue confirmed today was going to be worse than usual.Peter and his official accomplice, Alice, had caught up to me in their small off-white VW van, which was unsurprising, given they have had GPS from my phone for at least the last six months.The megaphone was off, because we were in town now.They could use it to bother me, but when it came to the other people, citizens of Portland, it was noise pollution.Instead they had shifted to a bright LCD screen, which was mounted on top of the van and constantly repositioned itself so it was always facing me directly.It had no sound, and I didnt turn back to look what it said, but I knew it already.It was a video of sorts, with infographics about my condition, photos of people who had suffered before me, and video clips of me in the act, which they only showed in short two-second bursts so as not to upset too many passers by.Most people havent seen it many times, at least not younger people.For some it creates a negative physical response.Halfway to the office, when I turned off the main street and down the quieter avenue where my work was, Alice started blasting the sound.Fewer people around, fewer caught in the crossfire.I remembered how much I hated the announcers voice  it was a man in his mid fifties probably, one of those guys with a deep, dramatizing voice who would announce movie trailers, at least before all those jobs went to the synthetic voice bots.They couldnt match up against a voice that hyped a movie perfectly, or in the thousands of customized ways that played on a persons own emotions and tastes.I was one block from work before Peter decided to pull out the big guns.He turned on machine attached to the headlights, which shone a light blue light in front of me.The hologram looked just like me, yet I was revolted by it.I was walking in front of myself, wearing a slightly better-looking jacket than the one I had on, my hair coiffed in just the right way.It was standing up straight, and looked like a half inch taller than I am.It was whistling a tune, its arms swaying ever so slightly.I saw my green office building through it, which gave the buildings facade a blue-green, soft look.In through the front door, up two flights of stairs, and take a left.They couldnt follow me in here, it was a private building and not even they could enter a private building without permission.I opened the door to the office that took up half the third floor.Jesse, my boss, was right near my desk, speaking with a beautiful dark-haired woman in a smart jacket....and heres Clyde, not too late this morning either!I was just speaking about you to our visitor.

He motioned me to come over, and turned to the woman.This is Helle Knussen, shes from our Copenhagen office and took the train over last night to advise us on implementing our new module.

She reached out her hand and took mine in a firm handshake.Very nice to meet you, Clyde.

You as well, Ms. Knussen.We could definitely use the guidance on this one.How long are you in Portland?

I expect at least a week.Id like to see some of the Pacific Northwest while Im here.I hear this area still looks quite authentically natural.

I nodded in agreement and excused myself to my desk by the large window.Unloading my bag and securing my tablet into my desk interface, I heard a gasp from where they were standing.My God, what in heavens name are they doing? Helle said.She lifted a finger at something beyond my shoulder.I turned, half knowing what to expect, and saw through the blinds bright white letters.It was them.Their large projector LCD had been put onto the window.Oh, thats...for me. I muttered.Her eyes widened in confusion and fear.On the screen I lay dead and lying crumpled on the ground, surrounded in a haze.At the bottom of the enormous picture was their main phrase in blinking white letters, the phrase they showed me three times every day of my life.**SMOKING KILLS CLYDE.SMOKING KILLS CLYDE.SMOKING KILLS CLYDE.**
