What do you see when I say the word 'ninja'?Clad in black, hooded, some kunais and knives hanging from their belt?Well, that just shows you how bad they really were at hiding.Sure they're trying to reinvent their image but their so steeped in history that the elders find it appalling to change tradition.But they're not the only ninjas that exist.There's more, all around the world.They hide in plain sight.You want an example?Well, find the most hipster looking guy or girl around you.See one?Alright, follow them.They're heading to the Chatime stand, right?Well, I know for a fact what they're gonna order.Caramel Milk Tea, extra bubble jelly and five shots of sugar.Absolutely diabetic, but that's the secret code they give to get their mission.Even the employees don't know about it, they just mindlessly key in the order and swipe their rewards card, which is more identification.They get that little slip of paper, and from there they get their mission before rubbing the ink off with their finger.That's how we get our missions.Weapons?Well, it is illegal to openly carry here in Malaysia, but phones are getting pretty smart these days, and theirs are no exception.They mainly get by without attacking anyone, using the phone with top of the line decryption algorithms to get through the toughest security there is.But when push comes to shove they've got a trick or two up their sleeves.Their glasses have sharpened ear rests.Their phones can fire a tranquilizer dart from the charging port.Used to be the headphone jack but Apple caught on to us.Had to change it.That's about it really.Our ninjas specialize in information.Which is why you don't see many unexplainable deaths happening here.Only one you may have heard of is the Altantuya case, but we needed him to take the top spot.We thought he'd be easily manipulated.Then he started getting greedy, so we started leaking stuff online.Because we deal in information.Which is why I'm talking to you openly about this.Because you're not supposed to be here much longer.Nice meeting you by the way.You're a great listener.----------------------
