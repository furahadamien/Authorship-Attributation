Everyone was arrayed outside Paul's cubicle.Nearest Paul, wearing all  red, the Extremist Communist Party of Pittsburgh members stood with several duffel bags filled with high explosive and second hand soviet-era sidearms.Just beyond them huddled the Ultra-Left Socialist Hunter-Killers, the famed violent insurrectionist movement whose brave menbers hijacked the USS Palmyra and scuttled her in international waters, sacrificing their own lives for the proletariat cause.Each had a shaved head and a purple headband, and stood by nervously, assault rifles slung over their shoulders.Behind these two main contingents a host of self proclaimed revolutionaries and social radicals had answered Paul's craigslist ad.There were a bunch of the individual uni-bomber types, and several middle aged couples eager to prove to themselves that they could put their political action where their mouths had been for two decades.Standing on his desk, kicking his computer screen to the floor to make more room, Paul gazed out on the capacity crowd.At least a hundred people filling the thirty fourth floor of the Harriman Insurance building."Thank you all for coming," Paul began, raising a bullhorn to his lips and blaring his voice across the office."Death to the capitalists!""DEATH TO THE CAPITALISTS!"the room full of revolutionaries replied in screamed unison.A couple of the Hunter Killers even discharged their rifles into the ceiling several times in their excitement.As powdered drop-ceiling fell onto Larry in accounting's work station, the frustrated pot bellied man got up, turned to Paul in annoyance and stormed off to the managers office to file yet another complaint.Paul paid him no attention and signaled to a man in the back of the office to hit a switch.Suddenly all the lights went off and a projection appeared on the glass wall of Mary's office.Inside, Mary got up and pulled down the interior shade, but not before giving Paul the finger.Paul cleared his throat and began."Brothers and Sisters!Today we take the battle for the proletariats of the world to the very heart of the capitalist  beast!"Another strong outcry of 'huzzahs' and 'hell yeahs' and 'da comarades' - as well as another round of rifle shots - and Paul continued, pointing at the projection with a laser pen."At O Nine Hundred Hours, the Hunter Killers will intercept the CEO of Harriman Insurance.Mr. Harriman will be tightly guarded, but the Brothers and Sisters of the Hunter Killers are not averse to the use of force, isn't that right?"Egged on, the Hunter Killers went full auto into the drop ceiling.Upstairs there were several loud screams and then the sounds of heavy objects falling to the floor.Paul shrugged."My point exactly, as the Hunter Killers take Mr. Harriman, the Pittsburgh Party will be taking control of building security here," Paul pointed to the 14th floor on the map of the building.As Paul continued laying out his plan to militarily take over the Harriman Insurance company, he saw his manager coming around the corner with Larry from accounting.Frustrated, Paul raised a hand to the expectant crowd and said, "just one second."Then he stepped down from his desk and walked over to meet the manager half way down the hall, pushing his way through the militant communists."Hi Paul," the manager said, "looks like Larry has a complaint again.I'm sorry to bother you with it."Paul pursed his lips and leaned lazily against the wall."What's up?"He asked matter of factly.Larry exploded."Whats up?!What's up is that this is the second time this week your extremist buddies have shot holes in the ceiling!"He gestured to Tim's empty cubicle, "they hit Tim last week!Jesus, he'll never walk again!"Paul sucked his upper teeth and hummed lightly, "hmmm," then he shrugged to the manager."Got to get back to it, man."Hands outstretched the manager lowered his head in supplication and said in a pacifying tone, "of course, Paul, of course.Gosh I'm really sorry to bother you with this.Larry," he said raising his voice, "you're fired!"Paul nodded as Larry, flabbergasted began to protest.The manager shook his head, "no no, thats the last straw larry, pack your things and get out."Dumbfounded Larry loosed a chain of curses but, at the subtle insistence of oane of Paul's crazier looking attendees, he started packing.Paul nodded pleasantly to the manager and was about to head back to heading his extremist communist take over of the company when the manager stopped him with a hand on the shoulder.Paul turned back around, looking put upon."Yeah?"The manager pointed at one of the open duffel bags of the Pittsburgh crew.A World War 2 era German stick grenade was poking out of the open zipper."Paul, uh, is that a hand grenade?"Paul made a lazy show of turning around to check."Hmmm hm, looks like."The manager paused for a moment and then nodded to himself."Got it, keep up the good work buddy."Then he clapped Paul jovially on the back and walked off.Paul made his way back to his ersatz soap box and picked up the blow horn.He couldnt remember where he left off so he decided to give them a quick pick me up to get the energy back in the room."Death to the capitalists!"He screamed and the room went wild again, bullets flying into the ceiling and dusting Larry with particle board as he lumbered angrily towards the elevator with a box of his belongings.*****

Korbius, Demonlord of the Octopodiae, lay on the black and white linoleum tiles of Byron's kitchen, tentacles swinging wildly in the air.Removed from the blood waters of the Nether Sea, Korbius's gelatinous flesh sagged heavily towards the ground.Still he flailed his eight tentacles through the air angrily, slapping them wetly against pots and pans, suction cups sticking to whatever they touched and dragging them about the room.Korbius's nearly formless body blocked the only doorway out, and Byron, terrified, held his grandmother's handwritten cookbook in two hands out in front of him, as if it might act as a shield against the otherworldly creature.The ground is slick in Korbius's crimson slime and, when Korbius flicks one of his tentacles into the air, Byron is sprayed with a shower of the cold red goop.You could say being covered in the bodily juices of a Sixth Dimensional Demonlord was the straw that broke the camel's back.Byron certainly felt that way and decided it was as good a time as any to start screaming.> Be silent, human!Cease your mating call!This is no time for copulation!Byron recoiled from the deep throated voice that suddenly came from inside his own head.He looked wild-eyed around the destroyed room."Who is that?!Help!Help me!"> Human, it is I, Korbius, Demonlord of the Octopodiae.Korbius speaks through your crude mind.Byron understood none of this and screamed louder.Korbius was *not* having it.> SILENCE!The word was equal part mental yell as it was unrelenting command and it made Byron stop yelling in spite of himself.> Where is Korbius, Demonlord of the Octopodiae?Byron was hyperventilating in relative quiet and only managed each syllable he spoke between two or three quick breaths."You're...in...my...kitch...en..."

> How has Korbius been summoned to Kitchen?Byron tried to channel his mindfulness meditation and failed utterly."I...don't...know!"His breathing began to slow down."I...was...I was reading... this book."Byron held the book up and a tentacle shot out and latched onto its cover, dragging it back toward Korbius through the mess of ooze on the floor.The gelatinous mass of demon octopus shifted on the linoleum, a process that created a series of ridiculous fart-like noises.Byron watched the absurd scene slack jawed as Korbius spun his central mass around and opened his single gargantuan eyeball.For a moment, Korbius stared at the cover of the book held in his tentacle.Suddenly a high pitched whine emanated from the demon's beak and he flung the book back towards Byron as if it were a live hand grenade.> The Demon Cantos!Impossible!Byron looked down at the book as it slid across the slick, tiled floor and spun to a stop at his feet.On the hand written cover it said in big, warm letters, 'Gran's Cookbook.'It was his Grandma's hand written cookbook.She'd left it to Byron when she died, only a week earlier, along with a letter insisting that Byron learn her favorite recipes, passed down from generation to generation.So Byron had decided to give it a try.He had been feeling a little under the weather, and so he chose to make a delicious pot of chicken soup.He broke out the old tome, opened it on the kitchen table and, going down the list of ingredients with his finger, he'd read each one aloud, a habit he'd formed when reading to help compensate for his dyslexia.No sooner had he finished the final ingredient - 'a large pinch of salt' - than an extradimensional portal of pure light opened in the ceiling of the kitchen, out of which fell the writhing red mass of Korbius, the Demonlord of the Octopodiae.That was forty seconds ago.Byron bent down and picked up the book, showing the strange octopus it's simple handwritten cover."This...this?It's just a cookbook.My Grandmother, it's her *cookbook*.I don't understand."Korbius recoiled at the further sight of the tome, opening several kitchen cabinets with his tentacles, emptying them of their contents, and slithering his entire large mass inside them, just as an octopus might squeeze its entire body into a soda bottle.As he slithered into his impromptu hiding place, Korbius began to beg.> Please, human.Korbius did not know.How could Korbius know he spoke to a Cantor?No, Korbius could *not* know.It is Korbius's honor to be in Kitchen.Korbius would *never* speak ill of Cantor human, or of Kitchen.Korbius is thrall to Cantor human.Byron's heart began to settle down even as his mind raced at the sudden shift in tone.He turned the book around again and brought the cover very close to his face, staring at the letters written there.He flashed back to his reading of the recipe.Hadn't he felt a strange thrill down his spine with each ingredient read?Hadn't his hands shook, almost imperceptibly, as they traced their way down the list?Suddenly, Byron's grandmother came to mind, old Nan, sitting in her lazy boy, smiling cheek to wrinkled cheek, and Byron could not tell whether the image was a memory or a message."I told you you were special Byron.That's why I left you my...cook book."She winked, the image disappeared, and when Byron looked back at the front of the book, at the words written there, they were no longer written in plain black marker, and they no longer read 'Gran's Cookbook.'Rather, in effervescent gold ink, shining impossibly bright, even through the thin layer of Korbius's muck, bold, proud letters proclaimed a new title."The Demon's Cantos."Amazed, Byron flipped through the transformed pages and where once there was only blue inked recipes for pie and soups, now there was an illuminated manuscript of epic beauty, with pages of gorgeous illustrations, strange creatures and spells with astounding names and titles.Where once there were ingredients, now there were words of power.Where once there was a recipe for chicken soup, now there was a page entitled "To Enthrall An Octopodiae."Korbius was now safely ensconced in the corner kitchen cabinet, only his giant eye peering out from the dark through the cracked open cabinet door.With fear apparent even in his mentally transmitted voice, Korbius asked.> What is my master Cantor's name?Byron looked up from the astounding book, his face awash in the magical glow of it words, and swallowed a lump in his throat, his eyes wide with wonder and confusion.Nervously, he whispered an answer."Byron."And then he passed out.*******

A lightning storm manifested from seemingly nowhere as Jack got out of his car and loomed over the crushed and broken man he'd just slammed into.A bolt of lightning struck nearby.Then another, and another.The overwhelming smell of ozone filled the air.Finally, the largest lightning bolt yet slammed down from the heaven's and struck Jack.Power surged through him, as the lights of his car exploded, his phone flew from his hand and blew up, and the nearby electrical wires began to rain down sparks before snapping in two and swinging down to the forest below.Overcome by sheer power, a voice as if God himself, spoke in Jack's head.> THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE JACK OF ALL TRADES

The lightning died down, Jack fell to the ground covered in sweat, hands on the warm asphalt, the dead man laying beside him and, suddenly, Jack knew how to install a gray water system in a late 19th century Victorian house.Or change the drainage catch on a split level.For months there had been a leak in the toilet on the second floor of Jack's mother in law's house, and now, sitting there on the highway, Jack knew that the problem was a simple gasket that had worn down and that he could fix it for under a dollar."Holy shit," Jack said to the empty street and the dead man and himself, "I'm a plumber!"Jack needed to be sure.He scrambled over to the contorted dead man and began rummaging through his blood-stained pockets until he found a wallet, which he flung open and searched for an ID.There was a driver's license and on it a name.Jack Wallace."See you Jack," Jack said, and then took out his list and crossed off another name.There was only one Jack left in this zipcode.Jack got back in his car and drove over to the last address.He arrived as the sun was coming up, his small pistol hidden away in the inside pocket of his jacket.It was a small, one-story house.As he circled the home, casing it, Jack noted that the drainage pipe in the backyard was three meters short of regulation.He also saw that one of the back windows was wide open.It had been a hot night and there was not a lot of crime in these parts.So Jack walked right up to the house and climbed inside.Once in the home Jack pulled his pistol and wiped beading sweat off his forehead.He realized he was very tired - how many hours ago had he killed Jack Wallace on the highway and taken his knowledge?When had he last slept?But nevermind all that, it was only the hunt that mattered.If he was right, this Jack, Jack Warner, was an auto mechanic, which would be a much-needed skill given the amount of time Jack spent on the road, hunting and killing other Jacks.Jack stalked through the hallway of Jack Warner's small home, opening doors slowly, pistol up and ready.He walked through the thin house, opening each door until at last, he came to a final room.It had to be the bedroom.Eager, tired, Jack turned the doorknob and gave the door a push.Jack heard the click before he saw the shotgun suspended from the ceiling.Then came the deafening blast of the shotgun's discharge and the buckshot took Jack hard in the chest.Eyes wide, back flat on the carpeted floor, Jack could feel his lungs filling up with blood.He struggled to get up, but could not get his feet under him.Someone walked out of the bedroom and kicked the small pistol out of Jacks limp hand, and stood over Jack, looking down at him appraisingly."Bagged me another one, I guess."Without any regard for Jack's desperate writhing and gurgling, Jack Warner bent down and began rummaging through Jack's pockets.He found Jack's wallet, opened it up, looked at the driver's license, and clicked his tongue against his front teeth."Yep."Then he gave Jack a disappointed look and shook his head at him."Thought you could sneak up on me unawares, huh?Big mistake, and not the first time neither."Jack's mouth was opening and closing like a dying fish as he tried to say something with his last breath.He could taste hot iron on his tongue.Jack Warner saw Jack was trying to say something, and so he bent down low and placed his ear to Jack's mouth.Wetly, Jack managed the words, his bloody hand reaching up and holding on to Jack Warner's shoulder for dear life."There...can...be ...only...one... "

Jack's hand went limp, the light left his eyes, and he passed right there on Jack Warner's carpet.Jack Warner for his part, nodded solemnly."Don't I know it, brother."Then he ran out into the back yard as quick as he could so that the lightning wouldn't start a fire in his house.He made it just in time, as a lightning storm coalesced above him.Bolts of blue electricity struck the ground in several places first, and then hit Jack right on the head, coursing pure energy through his veins.A voice, as of God, said to him:

>THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE JACK OF ALL TRADES.And then the storm was gone, and Jack fell to the ground.In the aftermath, he took a deep breath of the hot summer air and reveled in his new found knowledge.Slowly, he got up to his feet and started back inside to take care of the body.As he walked in through the back door, Jack's gaze fell on the drainage pipe leading from the back of his house.He realized, for the first time ever, that it was three meters under regulation."I'll be damned," he said, smiling to himself, "I'm a goddamned plumber."************
