I was the last of my kind, at the end of my time.This is my story.My planet was doomed.The alien species know only as C.A.T.had completely wiped out our military defensive.As a last ditch effort to stop them from advancing through the galaxy, I blew up my home.I got into my craft and set the director to find the nearest habitable planet.At safe distance, I hit the detonator.I didn't calculate for aftershocks and got blown off course.Which turned out to be the best thing for me.On this planet, a lot of what the indigenous species, humans, call "dogs" looked nearly identical to my kind.To the point where I would even try speaking to them, and they just kind of looked at me.They were not my people, much to my dismay, but I learned to blend in and be accepted.Eventually I learned their tongue, and felt more acceptance.I wouldn't find home for a while.I stumbled upon what the humans caked "police academies" and snuck myself in with the lot.Humans, even with their gear capacity for good, aren't the brightest, they never noticed I wasn't part of their group.It was fun for a while, stopping bank robberies, diffusing bombs, catching the bad guys.That was they life.I grew bored of it after while.Wanting to find a place where I could just live put the rest of my years in peace and comfort.So I just left one day.No shortage pf these "German shepards", so I doubt they noticed.That's the day I met you.(Without more info, that's all I could write up.Also had to get back to work.Good luck.It sucks now, and you really never get over it, but It does get easier.My dogs have been gone for 2years, and I think about them all the time.
