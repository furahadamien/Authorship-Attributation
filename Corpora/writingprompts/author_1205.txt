"Great, another Christmas where I am alive.", I sarcastically said as I open the Reddit is fun app.The apartment is empty, no tree, no smell of gingerbread, no lights, not one thing of cheer to be seen."Let's see what these fuckers decided to put up overnight", I said browsing the front page "People getting stuff from people who like them.More people getting stuff from people who care about them.Blah, blah, blah.Oh what's this?*I am loved and accepted for who I am and have a happy holiday season and a great new year?*

Ha!Nobody likes me.How can they?I haven't done anything to be liked.I am just the weird guy who creeps everyone out by saying *hi*.Maybe this year will be the last time."/u/czs5056 returned to browsing and would repeat the day 60 more times before finally succumbing to a heart attack at age 88, alone.
