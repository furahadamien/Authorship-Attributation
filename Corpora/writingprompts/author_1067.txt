I glared down the road, a bright green and red line, parallel.As if they were painted on the asphalt.It was the first time they'd ever been going in the same direction.I'd been seeing the lines since my 12th birthday.Almost 18 years on and I'd never seen these lines go in the same direction.Green had always been good to me.There were moments of obvious indulgence when it led me to a slot machine that was 1 spin from the jackpot, to the more subtle when I crossed paths with my now wife.It was the reason for every success I'd ever been fortunate to experience.My job, my wealth, my family, everything.Hell even my perfect luscious hair came from a pamphlet for an experimental procedure.It had come to a point where I barely even noticed the red line anymore, why would I it was always behind me.But today... the same direction?Oh well I started to follow both lines at this point, but I felt the excitement in my stomach.I'd never followed the red line, and even though I was still walking the green, technically I was following the red too.As I walked I noticed the lines began to slightly part, and much to my disappointment as I walked up to a T-intersection in the road, they parted ways.I stood there for a few minutes, looking off to the right, my eyes locked on that pulsating red line.It had taken me about 2 months before following the green line stopped making me nervous, after that I always knew I was safe and headed for something good.It was prosperous, but lets be honest, prosperous can be boring.But looking down the red illuminated line, I felt that nervousness creeping back up my spine, beckoning me to see where it went.For the very first time, I stopped noticing the green line.We grow up learning green is good, red is bad but these were celestial lines.Surely they'd been around longer than traffic lights?I made up my mind, today was the day.I headed off following the red line.Days passed as I continued on, stopping to sleep, eat and that's about it.Weeks turned to months and my surroundings continuously changed as I went country to country.The red line had taken me to Hsinchu, a small county about an hour drive out of Taipei the Taiwanese capital city.I walked through a a bustling marketplace.People everywhere but all I saw was red, the line had become my obsession and I barely lifted my head to look ahead.Something inside me told me today was the the day, today was when I would finally know.The line took a sharp turn down a dingy alley, I manoeuvred across a group of parked scooters and went down the alley.Following the line I took a second to notice that this alley was absolutely void of people, a second ago I was surrounded.Dark, damp and dimly lit I followed as the line took me around another bend and I stopped in my tracks.Huddled over with his back to me was a man, the line led straight to him.He was topless, wearing rags just to cover his privates.Thin, sickly with very little wispy hair.He looked homeless, could have even been dangerous but my burning obsession to finish this journey had taken over any common sense.I walked over to him, fast.I got about a metre away as he turned slowly to notice me.He looked at me, then looked down.He stared in disbelief at the line then back at me, then back to line.Could he see it too?His eyes widened as he revealed a smile with very few teeth left where they should have been."Hi, I'm not reall..." I stammered."YOU FOOL!"he interrupted almost laughing now.Before I could say anything back he lunged at me pushing me over.As I tried to grasp what was happening he sprinted off down the alley.It was then I looked down and noticed it.No green, no red, just a pulsating black line, straight from me to him.I scrambled up and chased after him."Wait!Whats happened?!".He hopped on one of the scooters and started it up, screaming off down a small street.I stood there staring at the black line, watching him drive off into the distance, but the further he got the more anxious I started to feel.Wait... no this wasn't anxiousness, it was something darker.As he turned the corner and I lost sight of him my knees buckled.I fell to the ground, profound sadness took over, debilitating me on the spot.I tried to stand up but all I could feel was this overwhelming depression.The black line grew, pulsating thick and thin as if to taunt me.What had I done?Darkness around me felt thicker, everything felt wrong.I lay on the ground, trying to slow my heartbeat but my insides felt like they were bursting.I could feel him getting further away, but there was nothing I could do to bring him back.Curse that red line...
