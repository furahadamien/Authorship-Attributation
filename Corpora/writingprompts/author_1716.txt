We should have known.When the Waterless came to our dimension, it was the first we had heard of the fifth element.Magic!No longer was it a mere story.We were enthralled by these beings that came from a world without water.This was what scientists had dreamed of.This was First Contact.We welcomed them and their magic to our dimension and offered them gifts of our purest water.The moment the Waterless envoy touched it, he dissolved.The Earthless were like friendly spirits, traversing life and space as an ethereal combination of magic, water, fire, and air.They came in peace, to learn and to trade.The elements that made up our Earth were poison to them.They withered and faded in its presence.It was like watching souls die.When the Fireless came, those beautiful crystalline beings, we tried to warn them, but our warnings arrived too late.As soon as they encountered the heat of our dimension, they caught fire and melted.The crackling, the bubbling, the cries of agony - they were horrifying.The Airless came armed with magic and greed, here to invade and take our precious Air that they were denied in their home dimension.The other dimensions had all devised magical protections to prevent such attacks; we, on the other hand, had no such defenses.The world panicked and prepared for a war we knew we couldnt win.We need not have worried.The moment the Airless entered our dimension, the air pressure crushed them like trash in a compactor.The pattern was there.We should have seen it.We should have known.But we were obsessed with the idea of magic.What was once a fantasy was now too much for us to resist.Generations of scientists dedicated their lives to finding a way into another dimension.Some of us dreamed of it, some gambled on it, some donated all we had to it, and all of us believed we would be the ones rewarded when the way was found.People lived and died with no other goal or dream but to reach magical worlds.When the breakthrough finally came and we found a way to breach the boundary between dimensions, humanity would tolerate no delays.A group of us embarked immediately to cross the interdimensional border.When we entered into the Earthless dimension, we found what we had come for.Magic.It crashed into us like a wave, filled us with power, echoed like a thousand songs through our hearts and our blood, intoxicated us like no drug ever could.We were beyond gods.We were everything.But there was a reason no dimension had all five elements simultaneously.They couldnt exist in balance.When all five interacted, they became unstable.We should have seen it from what happened to the others who came to us.We should have known.The magic filled us, and then shattered us.We used to wonder where dark matter came from.Now we know.***

First time trying this.I hope I formatted it properly.I know it's a bit late to the prompt, but I was inspired and wanted to try writing one.I'm a bit rusty since I haven't written in a long time.Hope it's alright!
