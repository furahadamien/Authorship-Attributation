"You look *incredible*," I said, snapping a picture and handing Dani's phone back."No filter necessary.James won't know what hit him."Dani nodded absently, her eyes already glazing over as her thumb tapped over the surface of her screen."Thanks, Tanya.You said he rides a motorcycle, right?"My heart sank: I had seen this level of disinterest uncountable times in the past few years, and already I could see how the date would go: James would make his dashing arrival on his motorcycle (but wearing a helmet, gloves, and leather jacket; Dani hated recklessness).In the bar (a nice cocktail bar, she liked to be treated but hated to feel pressure) he'd order a bottle of white wine and some stuffed mushrooms, his tongue already tying in knots as he realized she had already found something in him wanting, because no matter how nice Dani tried to be, she was just too easy to read.Or maybe she was only easy to read for me, because I wasn't only Tanya, her best friend, I was going to be James in less than two hours, and I'd been Mark and Jose and Chris in the dates before that, and a war hero fifty years before that, and a merchant sailor two hundred years before that, and on and on, so far that I couldn't even remember my original body, gender, or name.Half the time I wasn't even sure I had been born a human, but every year that passed I became certain that it didn't matter: the immortality and the shapeshifting had changed me so much that I certainly wouldn't die as one.But Dani had changed all that.Ever since I, in the form of Tanya, had first met her at school, while pursuing my thirty-fourth degree, I'd found myself feeling alive again.I'd been with brilliant women, with beautiful women, with talented women, with powerful women, but never a woman as kind and compassionate as Dani.For the first time in centuries I'd begun using my powers for good again, instead of just slipping through existence as unobtrusively as possible.We'd become friends, we'd become roommates, and for a while that had been enough.But not anymore.In a last-ditch effort, I said, "Please, give him a chance, Dani.You're so cautious.Just live a little!Go with your gut!What if he's the one?"Dani smiled."I hope you didn't tell him I could be 'the one'.It's fun to get out in the city and meet new people but...I don't think I'm in a good place for a boyfriend.""That's what you've said for years," I said.Dani had been dating a real asshole when I first met her, a prick who'd been with her since high school.Even though she hadn't seemed really traumatized by the breakup, she hadn't dated since."You're young!You've got a good job, you're living in a beautiful city!I've set you up with some really amazing people!"Dani laughed."Maybe you've done too good a job, Tanya.If the next guy wasn't going to be so cool, maybe I could settle for the one I was with."I shouldn't have snapped, but I hated it when she deflected."I just want you to be happy, and have someone!You're not going to have this opportunity forever."I said it more bitterly than I meant, because I knew I was wrong: as long as Dani lived, she would have someone trying to be with her.Dani's back stiffened."Well, maybe you should date some of these awesome guys yourself, then, so you don't end up like me."I couldn't hold back a smirk at that imagery."Come on, Dani--"

But the smirk had only pissed her off more."You know what, Tanya?Don't bother anymore.You can have them all to yourself.Just don't set me up with anyone again.""But--d" I was stunned.I'd never seen such a rapid transformation in her before.This wasn't just about what I'd said, there was something else going on with her.And I knew it would be stupid to try and ask her as Tanya.I'd have to ask her as -- "James?""Oh, don't worry, I won't stand him up."Dani grabbed her purse."I'm not *that* much of a bitch.I would tell you not to stay up but I don't think I'll be that late."*

As James, I shut off my motorcycle and looked over the sidewalk, my eyes meeting Dani's and then looking away again, as if I wasn't entirely convinced it was her.I had a right to that thought; she'd undergone almost as big a transformation as I had, all her anger with Tanya gone from her face.I needed time to build up trust, to find out what was actually going on with her, so I played it safe, smiling widely as I wrapped an arm around her shoulder (Dani found full-frontal hugs too intimate for a first meeting but thought a handshake too formal; thus, I always went for the three-second side-hug.)We made idle small talk as we placed our order, and I waited for any expression, any word that might clue me in to what she was actually feeling."So how'd you meet Tanya?"she asked after the waitress had dropped off our bottle of Chardonnay."She never tells me how she meets people."Her voice barely tightened around the name *Tanya*, but I could see that she was still angry.My stomach twisted.What if, in trying to make her fall in love with me, I wound up losing her friendship as well?"At a club down east," I said."She's pretty fun.You've been friends for a while, right?""Yeah.Since college."Dani lifted her glass and swirled it, but didn't drink."I can tell she cares a lot about you," I said."You wouldn't believe all the questions she asked making sure I was good enough for you.""Yeah."Dani sighed."She's got *great* taste."Then, realizing what she'd said, "I'm sorry.You seem really great.She's just...clueless."The sarcasm was so obvious that I couldn't let it go."Are you guys OK?""Yeah."Dani sounded so defeated that my stomach twisted again.Tanya was the shape and attitude in which I felt most comfortable.I liked to think that she was pretty similar to who I'd been originally; it was so easy for me to be her that the thought of Dani not being friends with her anymore was almost a worse rejection than the scores I'd experienced as the dates."Yeah," Dani said again."We're OK. Just, OK.I guess that's got to be good enough.Look, I...this isn't going to go anywhere, OK?I think I owe it to you to tell you that as soon as I can."I said, "Yeah.I figured.""I'm sorry.I just..." Putting her glass down, she twisted her hands around her napkin."...I think I go on all these dates because each time I hope maybe something magical will happen, and I can get over all the other bullshit but...that won't happen.I just have to accept both sides of the coin.I'm not going to get over it, and Tanya, she...she isn't ever going to feel the same."My jaw dropped."*Tanya*?"She nodded."Yeah.Sometimes I think there's something there, but she just keeps sending me on dates with everyone else in the world.I get so angry, but it's not her fault; she just wants me to be...."

She was so caught up in her napkin that she didn't notice me transforming until the sentence was almost done.James fell away.Tanya resurfaced.Dani's eyes widened."...happy," she whispered.I said, "I'm sorry.I...I'm an idiot."Dani's mouth opened and closed several times.She reached for her glass of wine and found the bottle instead, but still almost drained it.Then she took a deep breath."Do you want to go back home?"she asked.
