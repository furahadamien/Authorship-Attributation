"No, the other one."*I responded, pointing to my choice.*  "With the green crest.""Will that be dine in or carry-out?"*the clerk lazily inquired.The help in these trendier booths were never very prompt or professional, but it beat going back to the big chain store for produce.The way they treated their products was borderline unethical- not to mention unhealthy.*

"Carry out please."*It was a stupid question really- this product took forever to clean and this place never did it correctly.*

"With all those preservatives?No thanks."
