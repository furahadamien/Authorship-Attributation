Until now, I have always known him as Joel.Cool Joel.Everyone's Joel.He was prim king.He had a full ride to Duke university.The kid that won that mustang from that Taco Bell sweepstakes.You would think Joel would eventually ascend to a demigod by now.But when he called my name as I was walking in to Starbucks, I refused to believe he was a homeless guy.Just another veteran down on his luck.Soiled pants, dirt coated beard, but the same blue eye I remembered every time he called me a loser all of this adolescent years."And to think, Arthur turned about to be more than a nerd.Remember when I your  girlfriend dumped you because she wanted to ride in my new car?Good times, right?Hey, you got any change to spare?No, well god bless."
