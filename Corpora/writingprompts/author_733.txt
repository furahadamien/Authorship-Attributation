At first I asked 'why me'.I came to realize that it didn't matter.I had the blade and it would only work for me.Seven and a half billion people currently lived on this Earth and the number kept going up.Seven and a half billion people that were going to be snuffed out like a candle when this universe ended in a few short years.Why?Because it had been an experiment and the experiment had just about run its course.God, or whatever was in charge, was going to reclaim the energy and begin again with different physical laws.Two years ago I'd been at my lowest point.The car accident leading to depression and self medication.That led to getting fired, a brief stint in jail, then losing my house and pretty much everything I tend to the bank.Somehow I survived on the street.I'm not sure exactly how since most of the time was spent drunk on cheap booze or whatever I could get which did the same job.And then the Angel came.It was unearthly in its beauty, neither male nor female yet I ached to be in its presence."Your world is ending."It said in a voice which scraped like fingernails down my spine."There is nothing which can save it.However, there is a chance for this version of humanity to live on."I curled myself into the smallest ball I could.I wasn't worthy to listen to this being.I was nothing.Why was I the one it chose to drop this revelation on?I felt the scorching heat of love as it knelt beside me, its hand grasping my shoulder.Purpose rushed into my body, the feeling that I could no longer sit while slowly killing myself so I could have my wife and girls back."There is another Earth in an alternate dimension.A land filled with plants and animals, but which has never been touched by humans."The Angel pulled opened my hand and placed something in it.My hand reflexively curled around the item as it started to tip.With an act of willpower, which I hadn't used in ages, I cracked open one eye to see the shining thing in my hand.It was a long, curving blade which seemed to glow from within the white metal it was made of.I looked from the blade to the Angel.It smiled at me.A smile which held sadness greater than I had ever felt before."That blade is all the hope humanity has.I charge you with a task which weighs heavy on my eternal soul, but it must be done.""What do you want me to do?""You must end as many lives as you can.The streets must run red with the blood brought forth by that knife.For only those killed by the blade will be born again on the other Earth."I had to kill?I had wanted to kill the guy who had looked at his phone and not the road, but I hadn't been able to, even after he took my family.Could I do this?"You must!"The Angel commanded."Humanity is depending on you.You have five short years to send as many to the other world as you possibly can.And you must not let yourself be stopped."I felt instantly empty and realized that the Angel was gone.The weight of the knife was still heavy in my hand, so I knew it hadn't been a dream.My first kill came the next morning.Some stupid teenager going through the alley I'd slept in decided to harass the bum.I forgave him the first kick, even though I knew it had at least cracked a rib.It was when he bent over to spit that I slid the blade into his chest, even as I apologized for taking this life.He would get a second life in the new Earth, which was much more than most would get.I felt his soul being pulled through the blade, the light in his eyes fading out at the same time.I dumped the body in a nearby dumpster, after checking him for cash and valuables.He wouldn't need money any longer, but I would if I was going to have the strength to become a killing machine.I used some of the cash to get a cheap motel room for a few hours, cleaning myself up a bit and changing into some clean clothes from a thrift shop I'd passed.I went through the kid's wallet, the memory of his face burned forever in my mind, just like every person who followed.His address was in his wallet, along with a family photo.A photo which hurt me to look at.They looked happy together.Smiling parents, the boy, and two identical little girls.I'd just broken a family.Like my own had been broken.This time it was different.I picked up the knife, looking at myself in the reflection.I could bring his family together again.Give them life when I couldn't do the same for mine.It was hard, but I sent them all over.The parents were easiest, but the twin girls reminded me so much of my own and they looked so peaceful as they slept.If I didn't kill them, they wouldn't be with their family, so I found the courage to do what I had to.And then I found the baby boy.Jeff was his name, painted on the wall in big bold colors.I sat in the nursery for hours debating with myself.Would they be able to care for a newborn on the new world?Survival itself would be the main issue they faced until they could build shelters and start working together for food and safety.A baby would only be a draw in their meager resources until things were set up.In the end I slit his throat, ending the cries for its mother by sending him to her.They'd provide, or he would die, either way it would be with family.That's how my killing sore began.I'd break into family homes and send them all together.A few times I almost ended up the dead one, but I was righteous in my duty and prevailed.I even tried to explain why when they begged me not to kill them, but they couldn't understand that I was trying to save them.After the first month my total was still only ninety eight souls saved.I knew that I'd need thousands at a bare minimum for a viable breeding base.I needed to work faster, and smarter if I could.I kept myself on the move, never stopping for long in one place.It didn't take too long for the authorities to realize that all of my kills were committed with the same blade.They tried to hush it up at first to keep it from being sensationalized, and to prevent mass panic.They couldn't keep the news from breaking after my biggest night.I'd gotten off a greyhound in a sleepy little suburb of Chicago.The type of place you felt you could keep your doors unlocked and no one would break in.Even if they tried, the neighbors kept an eye out for each other.They did lock their doors though, even had alarms on a lot of the houses.I'd learned to get around those so they wouldn't interrupt my mission.God helps those who help themselves 

After the first house, with a family of four and a young couple in the garage apartment, I felt that it was a special night.Not a one of them had made any noise loud enough to alert their neighbors.I left my chips on the table and let it roll.I worked my way down the street, making a river of blood through the subdivision.By the time the sun peeked above the horizon I had saved over two hundred souls.In one night!I cleaned myself up in the last house and stopped for a celebratory breakfast at a Waffle House.The gruesome news hit the airwaves before I finished breakfast.At first it was thought to be a couple isolated incidents, and then the authorities played connect the dots with dead bodies.The patrons in the restaurant all wept at the news, scared about what kind of evil could do such a thing.Was it terrorists?Some sort of cult?I wanted to scream at them, tell them that I did it.I had saved a whole chunk of their community from the doom which was slowly creeping up behind them.I wanted to, but couldn't risk the mission.Things got more difficult after that night.People began to connect things together and the news ran rampant with stories of the Angel of death moving throughout the country.I bought a motorbike and drove South, away from where I'd been killing.I had to keep my kills to a minimum as I traveled, hiding those few that I had to do.Some people I encountered were so skilled, so nice, or so suited to the new world that I couldn't pass them by.In a small town in South Carolina I found a farm using slave labor, more or less.Chinese workers smuggled into the country and dumped on the farm instead of getting the new lives they had paid for.They kept them chained together in the field and hit then if they dared look up from the berries they were picking.The guards weren't focused on anything but the slaves,  which made them easy to take down quietly.I used a normal knife on them, they weren't worthy of the new world.The slaves heard something going on, but knew better than to look.I couldn't help but wonder if technology wouldn't be easier, cheaper, and more legal for what they had them doing.It didn't change my mission.One by one I went down the chain, sending the people to actual new lives and freeing them from the bonds of servitude.Then I stole some gas and got back on the road.After using the remaining gas in their tank on the farm buildings, leaving a trail to where I'd stashed my bike.The fire would cleanse.In Atlanta I bumped into a miracle.I found my twin in the form of a German furniture maker nearing the end of his solo trip to the US.I sent him over, then broke his body to before burning it, and the bodies of everyone in the funeral home, in their cremation furnace.In the three day before my twin's fight I went wild, crossing over as many as I could without immediately bringing on too much attention.They found a few of the bodies the day before my flight, but not enough to be sure that it was my work and not one of the copy cats which had sprung up.Hell, the farm killings were still being looked at as a possible retaliation by another criminal syndicate.Turns out that they usually had the 'immigrants' making drugs, not picking berries.Most of my Atlanta killing spree became clear while I was sitting in the airport lounge waiting for my flight to be called.*continued in reply*
