Predictability is really one of life's most underrated miracles.If youre alive then your heart will beat, if you fall over your knees will bleed, and if you inhale then you will enjoy the pleasure of breathing.Unfortunately, the pale-faced coughing man splayed across the dirt and shrubs of a foreign land he had only heard mentioned in punchlines, didnt meet one of those criteria.So predictably, the bad news is that this man is going to die because he cant breathe.But this man who's found himself dying on some shrubbery is not the first, nor last person to pop their lung like an old balloon.And thankfully for this man, I am very well versed in the predictability of humans and the location of a lung.No matter how much time passes, at their core, humans have always remained the same.Sure, aesthetically they can change, some decades they were plump and fair skinned with blushing cheeks that remain flushed with the consequence of a one night stand.And other decades have been spent as dark-skinned warriors with tense muscles and furrowed brows whove just learn the burden of a free gift.But ultimately the things on the inside that keep them alive are all of the same design.I know, some truly profound revelations Ive uncovered here.But sometimes, its the stupidly obvious things that need the most attention.For example, I use to think that putting leeches on people and draining them of blood was a cure for pretty much anything, nowadays its generally agreed that no, blood should stay on the inside and also leaches are disgusting.But there is single predictability that not only acts as a folly to my deep and intrinsic revelation, one that not only ruins it but steps on it, throws it into a fire and screams out a giant parting fuck you:

humans will always be really fucking stupid.And no matter how predictable a situation may seem, no matter how routine or mundane fixing something should be, the power of pure stupidity should never be underestimated.Ive had my doubts that Im human myself sometimes.I dont know why Im still here, or how Ive lasted this long.Im an anomaly, an inconsistency in the human race.Youre born, you live, you die.And someone mustve been looking the other way when I was meant to die, but I seem to be stuck in the midway point.Somewhere out there a God, a reaper, an angel, or a serial killer mustve fucked up in a major way because Im still here.Humans are born, humans live, and humans die.But all my fears were apparently unfounded because judging by what I do next, I am the biggest stupidest human whose ever fucking lived.My decision to work in emergency medical services in a third-world country was based on the urge to do more, to make the most out of my life.Other people would call this a mid-life crisis and recommend just buying a Ferrari.This plan seemed great in theory but actually being here apparently hit a bit too close to buried memories of the broken bones, bloody faces, and endless bullet holes of the last war I decided to attend.Some of those memories were apparently buried for a reason since they were outdated a few fucking centuries ago.So this man who is rapidly turning blue has a pneumothorax, which means his lungs dont work no good due to a hole.That puncture probably has something to do with the shrapnel lodged in his chest.This means there is a lot of blood everywhere.As you can see fellow human, this is all very predictable.What I did next was also very predictable, if it was 1776 and we still fought with swords and had a 40 percent chance of dying before adulthood, sure.But unfortunately this is 2019 and I just reached into an open wound of a man who has definitely not been administered with morphine with filthy hands, no gloves, and a knife.My assistant who saw a moron whose job it was to stop the bleeding of a dying man grab a knife and start cutting into him, tore me away.She worked to frantically patch up the mess I started while calling me a crazy bastard.She doesnt speak much English but since working with me, she thought the effort to learn the all its curses was worth it.I had to agree.The man who we had found dying was still wheezing but it was dying down to a pitiful moan as his oxygen-deprived heart begun to fail, and the assistant's chest compressions were getting growing frantic.For some reason I couldn't seem to get up and help, it was like watching a scene from someone else life.My hands trembled.For the first time in my life, my hands actually trembled.I think Ive been doing this for way too long.&#x200B;

Really cool prompt, dude!Thanks for a fun little writing exercise.
