The gunsmoke lingers lazily about a foot in front of me, sharp smell of sulfurous anger assaults my nostrils, foreign yet familiar.The smoke gently obscures the writhing psychopath on my floor, bleeding out all over my goddamn berber carpet that I just had cleaned not even a week ago.As the blood soaks in a widening pool around this weirdo, I muse that perhaps I should lay down a darker color sometime soon.His gurgles and wet shrieks snap me back, and I retrain my pistol on him, just in case he gets a second wind and decides to get squirrely again.Can't ever really tell with these gene\-freaks, ever since that drug hit the market some 60 someodd years ago and everyone was sold the promise they could live forever, shit just kinda has been going downhill.I was too old when they started handing out that drug, whatever it was called.PermaLife?VitaLife?I can't fucking remember these days.I was too old, but I had a funny feeling about it.A man shouldn't trust strangers in fancy suits when they talked about money, souls or beauty, and this certainly qualified.Everybody wanted to stay pretty, got to stay pretty, right down to the genetic level.Problem was it was too good to be true\- these kids apparently never heard of Microsoft Windows.Always wait a while before buying a brand new product\- it's always rushed and there are always problems they didn't account for.Except this time this product gave your whole brain a blue screen of death.Polymyelinating Colloidal Hyperagitation, the people with pay grades bigger than mine called it.Rest of us just called it the Giggles.Turns out, even though you can keep the body looking young, the mind's a different matter.Damn thing can only process so much information, it has to evolve in order to keep your sanity.That's why you start forgetting shit when you're older than dirt like me.Problem is the new drug stopped the brain from being able to do that.So it just kept getting overstimulated like someone threw a Chevy in neutral and kept pressing the pedal.Some folks, younger ones, handle it a little better, but get up to my age chronologically and everything starts to go catty whompers eventually.Nerves and neurons fuse and flare, too much electroconductivity happens in the brain, too much hyperperfusion, throws 'em into a state of superacute psychosis\- at least that's what it says in the fine print.The brainiac's are still throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks, but they at least got the warning out about, oh 10 minutes before everything took a massive shit all over the place.Speaking of shit, the smell of voided bowels cuts through the smoke and let's me know that pissboy here isn't going to be getting back up.I poke him in the balls with the end of my cane, for good measure.Anyone can shit themselves, but no matter how psycho you are, you react when someone jabs a metal rod in your balls.I stick 'em a few times, and nothing in his rictus\-grin face shows me he's still on this earth.I punch a few buttons on my recessed wall communicator and wait until the swirling 'standby' notice disappears."Got another one, eh, Bill?"my neighbor Rich damn near scares the shit out of me as he appears in my doorway suddenly

"Christ almighty, Richie, you almost got your ticket punched too, ya asshole."I realize I'm pointing my pistol at his chest, and lower it, feeling the jolt of adrenalin course through me.I ride the hammer home and tuck the piece in my holster in my waistband.Richie shrugged."You'd be doing me a favor.Get me off this train wreck before it gets really bad."he shuffles to the doorway, holding on to the doorjamb for balance.Richie could probably use a cane or a walker of some sort, but he's either too proud or too stupid to get one."What's this, number four now?""Something like that.You want a coffee, Richie?I was about to put a pot on."I say, waving him in.The wall caller still tells me to standby."Maybe.Was thinking about taking a walk down to McCarveys.Maybe pick Annette up on the way, wanna tag along?""I dunno, Richie.Is McCarveys even still standing?Either way, I don't feel like blasting my way through a dozen more of these loonies just for some watered\-down bourbon."The swirling standby message has stopped, then disappeared, and a new message prompting me to select what service I need comes up.I hit medical, police and sanitary, then hit send.The standby message reappears."It's strange."Richie says suddenly."What's that, now?""I says, it's strange.I'm looking at this freako, here, and in my mind I'm thinkin', 'what a waste of a life.'Then somewhere some other part reminds me this thing is about as old as we are, just about.It's just a weird thing to rectify, mentally.Ya know?"Richie says, tapping the head of the dead guy with his shoe."Yeah.I just think it's funny that this shithead wanted to live forever and ended up dying before I did."I chuckled, and Richie smiles and shakes his head.Irony's a bitch.The wall caller chirps and an automated voice asks me what the nature of my emergency is."Well, it;'s not an emergency per se, but there is a dead guy on my floor, so I figured someone should be alerted."I say.You know your old when you hate people but still consider the 'good ol days' to be when someone with a pulse answered an emergency call."You stated; someone has died.Is this correct?"the wall caller asks."Yep.""Can you identify the cause of death?"the wall caller asks.I think for a moment."Acute traumatic exsanguination."I reply.Richie snorts a chuckle.The line goes silent for a few seconds."Do you have reason to believe that the deceased is an individual who may have taken MetaLife brand chemical supplements?"the wall caller asks, except this time the tinny voice has changed into someone a bit more authoritative.I hesitate, knowing where this is heading."It's certainly not outside the realm of possibility."I respond.I swear I can hear the wall caller click in frustration."A representative from Foundation Pharmaceuticals is being dispatched along with police, medical and fire to your location.Please do not touch or alter the deceased.If you have animals or pets, please secure them away from the deceased.Do not ingest bodily fluids from the deceased.Do not..."

I sigh, knowing what's going to come next.The suits will show up, grill me for the next three hours over what happened, scold me for not taking the subject alive or alerting them while he was still alive, then they'll look at my record and start accusing me of all kinds of things like manslaughter or freak hunting, all while denying that there's any connection between their product and the near billion and growing number of people around the globe showing similar effects, there will be gag orders, I'll have to lawyer up...

"...in the deceased's mouth, nostrils, or any other oriface.Do you have any questions or comments before we terminate this call?""Yeah."I say, grabbing an extra loaded magazine from my kitchen drawer, "I'll be down at McCarvey's on 4th street if you need me."
