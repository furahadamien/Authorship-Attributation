I fought tooth and flipper to the very end!Even under infinite duress, I clutched onto my spatula and did not lose hope.The League had finally accepted me and I would prove myself in the Rift... but alas, I was bested.The beast still wears my skin today.One of the rarest and most valuable of skins in all Rune Terra and obvious testament of our glorious combat.Surely, Valhalla will have need of Urf?!
