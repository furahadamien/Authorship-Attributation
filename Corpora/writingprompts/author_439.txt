Ahh.The plan has worked.The bully nation known as the United States has been fooled into exile, and the world rejoices.But not all for the same reason... without the crutch of funding and support the US had provided things became hectic.Nations that feared consequences from the superpower gained confidence and began acting against other countries.Without the giant to keep things in check smaller countries gained a thirst for what they never were allowed to have.Imperialism became the name of the game.And there was no US to call for help.
