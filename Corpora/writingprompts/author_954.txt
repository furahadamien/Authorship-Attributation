It was a joke between them.Every year Luna would ask for a pony and every year her dad Lou would tell her to write Santa.Luna was seventeen now and in a bit of a rebellious stage.Going to parties, getting drunk, doing who knows what with her boyfriend Dylan.Every conversation between father and daughter ended in an argument.Things had gotten better between Luna and Lou recently though after Dylan and Luna had broken up.He had been expelled from the local high school after spray painting rainbow coloured penises on the walls outside the gym.When they stopped seeing each other every day things kind of just fizzled out between them.This was a few months before christmas and Lou had really thought things were getting better between them.They had been watching a T.V talent show together for the last few weeks -every Saturday.Lou knew that if she had just wanted to watch the show she could have caught the highlights on YouTube.One Saturday she brought up the pony joke again.And like every year he told her to write Santa.Luna's mother Abigail rolled her eyes fondly at them and took another sip of her wine.Luna grabbed the notepad on the kitchen counter that they used for writing down the grocery list.After they had finshed watching the show Lou looked at the note and saw that Luna had addressed it to 'Satan' and not 'Santa' but he shrugged his shoulders.Luna had also had some wine with her dinner so he thought that he probably didn't have to worry that she was secretly a satanist.Laughing at his own thoughts he went to bed.------

It wasn't until christmas morning that Lou realised he had reason to worry.There was a frumpy little pony in the backyard.It wasn't very impressive -something that would entertain kids at a birthday party or something.What was more concerning was that it was breathing fire and huffing out billowing grey clouds like a chain smoker."What's this?"He asked Luna."My pony" Luna said as she brushed its mane "Satan got him for me.""Satan?""Yeah I told him about our joke and well, he has a pretty terrible sense of humour.Don't worry though dad, I'll get him to take him back after dinner."Lou was worried though."Why were you talking to Satan?"He asked trying to sound stern despite being dreadfully confused."I was talking to mum and she said that I could invite my new boyfriend to dinner -he's not very close to his family you see and I didn't want him to be alone on christmas.""Boyfriend?!""Yeah" Luna looked bashful now "Sorry I was going to tell you earlier but then Luce went and did this.His sense of humour is terrible but I just know that the two of you are going to get on like two peas in a pod.He helped me quit smoking you know.""Smoking?!"Lou was glad the fridge was fully stocked with his favourite beer.
