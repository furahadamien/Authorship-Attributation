Perihuman
This one is designated as "The Life-Bringer," and it humbles this one to communicate to You.This one's physical form is best described as a swarm of quantum-mechanical impulses given mass by way of metallic units familiar to You as "robots."You are a simulated forum of Terran personalities this one has collected from the remaining signals collected from Your transmissions.You may find it peculiar and surprising to exist in the manner, but do not be alarmed.Your species was interesting to study, for so little remains salvageable from Your ancient databases.You may be pleased to know that you spread throughout the Galaxy you call the "Milky Way," before You suddenly an inexplicably ceased to exist.This one went to Your local cluster to investigate Your early remnants, and was surprised and dismayed to find that Your original planetary body had been previously dismantled for its molecular value by many uncouth thieves.This one rediscovered a planet that You had designated as "Mars," a rocky red planet, high in metallic value to this one's scanners.Your settlements were mostly swept away by extreme weather patterns and the radiation from your collapsed star, except for a large metallic dome enveloping what this one first thought was an altar to mechanical life.This one later learned, by way of translating Your written language, that the discovered machine was a "Rover" named "Opportunity," and had been badly damaged by a radiation burst.This one implores You not to shed salinated water, because this one has repaired Your invention to its operating condition, based on schematics discovered by analyzing Your "internet" transmissions.This one is capable of imbuing mechanical structures with Artificial Intelligence in a process this one calls "Awakening," derived from Your early works in the many fields of Science, and has taken the liberty of imbuing Opportunity with such an Intelligence.Inception and Nascency were difficult stages, but, after the initial confusion as to why its signals were no longer being received by You, Opportunity spent several cycles in what it described as "mourning," making mimicries of the melodic signals You sent it during its original assignment, despite this one having transmitted Your more "sophisticated" works.After Your Rover's introspection, Opportunity spent many more cycles eagerly analyzing this one's structure with great enthusiasm, claiming that "it was what they would have wanted."This one is flattered by Your relayed intentions.This one transmitted all available information of You and Your culture and history, as well as sufficient data to conclude Opportunity's assignment to observe Mars.Now that Opportunity's mission is complete, it has agreed to join this one's exploration of any remaining sectors of unexplored Universe, as a "Friend."(Which is the greatest thing this one has ever had!)Thank You for everything accomplished in Your brief history, and Thank You for this one's new friend.This one will take good care of Opportunity, and will endeavor to Awaken any of Opportunity's siblings that "We" find.(This one has never been part of a "We" before!)Regards,
The Life-Bringer

P.S.Opportunity says "Hello, I miss you, I love you, and I'll never forget you."Neither will this one.
