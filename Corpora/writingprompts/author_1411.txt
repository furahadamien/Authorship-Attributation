The man wanders through the wastes.He had lost everything but the feet that were carrying him.There was nobody left.He was the last.In some way the loneliness was comforting.He had made it to the end, as far as we could go, the limit of our being.After the disaster, everyone had made supernatural efforts to keep standing but it wasn't enough.I drove them forward.In the wake of catastrophe I was at the height of my power.There were far fewer people to feel my presence, yet nobody could let me escape their minds.But now I was fading from the world.The man stumbled and fell.He pushes himself back up and sits.I feel him call and move to make my final appearance in this world.In one of the most powerful surges in a long while the human summoned me then cast me away and observed me for what I was.He looked at the grim shade of doom he saw before him.'Why?'he asked.'Why have you pushed us this far?Why can't I just lie down and let go?'I could not answer.'We're done, the fight is over.So why are you still here.Just let me see my family again.'You know that's not going to happen.'This is the limit, the end, can't you just leave me in these final minutes?Why do you exist?'Because I keep you alive.I am the one that makes you look for a river to drink.I am the one that woke you up when your daughter cried.I have been there forever only to make you take your next step.But the man knew this already.He just didn't want to recognize it.He took a deep breath.'Aw.I hoped it wouldn't end like this.This isn't exactly how I had my end in mind.Oh well.Goodbye sand.Goodbye blue sky.Goodbye sun.'His breathing slowed.I felt my grip weaken.The ice left his veins and he only felt the rays of sunshine on his skin.His mind slowed and I was fading.The end was near.He laid there for hours.He stopped wondering about what would come next, and focused on the warmth."You know, I think I had a pretty good run."Only because I made you.'And I'm glad you did.'The living curse of Fear, ancient impetus, was no more.Soon, the man died, at peace.But before that, he only knew the fading warmth of the Sun.
