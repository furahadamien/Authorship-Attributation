Dead Man's Hand 

His name was Loyal Jones and he and his brother Lucian "El Diablo" Jones were on the run.US customs were on their ass hard core.Getting to the Ghost Canyon in Mexico was the only way.they weren't going to be dead men or worse."Jesus, Take the wheel."Loyal chambered a round on his M16 ."Satan , behind me.Jesus Vega  glowered at him though if you'd asked him, he's have said the name fit.Lucian was a scary blanco even by cartel standards 

"Budda, get the 50 cal."Enrico Vega was as always placid which given his rather unpleasant military background was kind of surprise.The heavy bolt on Ma Duece made a heavy clatter."Looks like two pair and a duece"  Lucian grinned

"We'll be a dead mans hand if we fuck this up" Buddha said .The men looked at him in surprise but nodded, the serious potential for Los Personas No Mas was on everyone's mind.The two and half ton truck  was elderly though the engine and suspension upgrades were a lot more high speed low drag than you'd expect from this kind of vehicle, the mounted 50 cal also came in handy

As the truck roared to life they could see the Federales were closing in ,four  big GMC trucks and a helicopter.The big 50 boomed, 10 rounds in a second , smashed through thin skinned vehicles like tissue paper .The first careened off the road and the second swerved 

Loyal and his crew  had a narrow window in which to escape, not much time before DHS sent in something with a lot more firepower or just blew them to hell 

The 50 boomed again and it was followed by a much quieter round from an M203 mounted under Loyal M16.The helo veered off, the pilot must have sensed something or was just avoiding the .50 cal 

The chase was still on though and while the Mexican border with its paid off guards was only a few miles away , it felt like an endless run 

More trucks joined in , probably a dozen now kicking up an epic duct storm as the careened across the desert behind them.No doubt some BLM or EPA guy would have shat a brick if he'd seen it but the DHS's wanted blood.Buddha kept them back , dropped another 90 rounds from the big machine gun  in short burst till he was out  .He yelled "Empty" 

"Don't worry about it" Loyal yelled.He was worried, the gas tank was leaking like a sieve , probably caught round from the DHS guys 

"Hang on!"Jesus made a tight S turn, a fantastic move for a two and half ton truck doing sixty and slid into a blind spot.They were far enough over the border that DHS wouldn't follow them 

"That's why they  always say Jesus take the wheel " Satan cracked 

"Fuck you, Cabron' but Jesus was grinning from the adrenaline rush and just for being alive

Buddha climbed off the vehicle "Well, could have been better but  got the money.Looks like we won't cash in our chips today."Loyal heaved a sigh , thanks God or somebody Santa Muerte who knows for another day with  a good crew.He got out his cell phone, time to call for a ride, Since the money was all there, and a a little more, El Jefe wouldn't be too pissed and they'd get paid.Time for tequila , senrioitas and some well earned rest.
