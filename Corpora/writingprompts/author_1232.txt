I sit in my room, back at my grandparents house at 9pm.I sigh a huge sigh of relief, my Christmas Eve and Day went way better than expected.I was so tired and worn down from the stress of seeing my family, after everything that has happened.I pick up my phone, a small text from my boyfriend gracing my screen.I smile a little and read it.Merry Christmas, my love.I love you so much.<3 

Then the tears start.The holiday was so hard for me, I was so scared of what people knew and how it would go, worried that my presents werent going to be liked.I cry hard, not hearing an I love you all day until he texted me.I try to calm myself, wiping my tears as I switch to the Reddit app.Then I see it, there on the front page, the Writing Prompt.I read it and the tears start up again, as I smile like a fool at my phone.A complete stranger telling me that Im loved and appreciated, feelings that I rarely feel from family, words that I havent heard in a long time, and they are written for all to see.They mean much more than the original poster thinks it does.I wipe my eyes and decide to share the amazing feeling I got from the prompt, sitting upright in bed as I type, wishing every one a Merry Christmas and applauding all those who worked up the nerve to deal with the stress and anxiety I know family can bring.Merry Christmas, Reddit, I hope 2018 brings you so much joy.
