"Seven hundred trillion dollars?What could you even do with that much money, grandpa?"I sighed in fond recollection, leaning back in my recliner."You can keep a secret, right, Timmy?"...


Years ago, I had an office job.Like the idealistic fools all young people are, I thought that I could make the world a better place, despite the trillions of dollars I was worth, even back then.And it was fantastic!You don't have friends, true friends, until you're all throwing together five dollar bills for a midnight run to Taco Bell on a Saturday night.Millionaires don't know the warm feeling of acceptance of your buddy letting you crash on his couch and eat his leftover mac n' cheese.You can't buy netflix and chill, even if you can buy Netflix, with enough left over to trademark the Earth's climate.So I worked nine to five every day, and yes, the job sucked.But it was the kind of suck that you experience with friends, and it makes the shared experience something more.Something like a life.I had an office family, of sorts.Richie, the office clown, who was always there with the most god-awful puns ever imagined.Deborah, who was just sweet and caring and so desperate for this month's diet to really work this time.Luke, the quiet kid that played MMORPGs in his spare time and couldn't hold down a five minute conversation without bringing up goblin siege tanks.And we were there for each other, on breaks and lunches, in little wedge-shaped slices of the day.Money can't buy that.At least, not without raising some very weird questions.Our boss was a great boss.An elderly man named Roger, who really cared about all of us.He put in 110%, and we respected him enough to do the same, and we were a team.Tears were shed at his retirement party, and I even covertly slipped a million into his bank account, even if doing so risked my cover a bit, but the guy deserved it.But all good things come to an end.Our dipshit CEO had a job opening to fill and a spoiled brat of a son with an MBA, and the two met like a turd and a toilet bowl.Enter Reginald Cunningham the Second, or Reggie, for short.Reggie was a middle-aged man who had spent his whole life riding his father's coat-tails.Anything you could do with money to make your life easier, this guy did without thinking.And he flaunted the wealth to anyone who would listen."My Maserati is in the shop -again-, so I had to drive a Mercedes today!My god, how do you people live like this?"So, one day, I got called to the office, and Reggie was there with this big smirk on his spray-tanned face.He had spent so much time primping and posing in front of a mirror to get that perfect look, without a single hair out of place.There was likely a suite of hairdressers and personal trainers a room away, but I could never be bothered to search...


"John?I called you here today because we need to cultivate a sense of style, here at JobCorp, and I gotta let you know, man, you just don't have any panache, you know?Any style.I mean, just look at you!Pressed slacks, plain black shoes, standard dress shirt, it looks like you asked your mom how business casual looked!"I asked my butler, actually, but still, the man had a point."We've gotta let you go, John.You're just not gonna amount to anything except this nine-to-five life, you don't have any aspirations, and you're always dirt broke!It's pathetic, man..." He paused for a moment and let the early morning light catch his perfect golden hair, making it shine with radiance.I found myself just kinda nodding along with him, wondering if he actually practiced this, but deep down, I was starting to get a little upset.This guy didn't work for a single dime he had, leeched off of his father's success, and bragged about it every chance he got.I looked down at his desk, and my name caught my eye on a sheet of paper.I grabbed it, skimming the contents, ignoring him for a moment.Evidently, this asshat was misreporting our pay, on top of everything else!He had my salary down as double what I was actually making, and I know no one in the office had anything close to a six figure salary, but yet here we were, practically millionaires on paper!Suddenly, the paper was torn from my grasp, and for the first time, I actually got to see Reggie outside of his perfect, rehearsed composure."You didn't see shit, if you know what's good for you, John!Get the hell out!I'm going to ruin your life if you say so much as a word about that!"I shrugged, which was apparently the wrong move."Listen here, you little shit, I am the king, and you're just a lowly pawn!I can make you disappear overnight with just a phone call!Money is no object!So I'd be quiet if I were you... now get the fuck out of my office!"So, what else could I do?I packed up and left.But in the back of my mind, it kinda hurt a bit.This pompous jackass just kicked me out of something that wasn't really a home, but it was a me-shaped hole in the world that I certainly worked hard to carve out.So I decided to teach him a lesson!Reginald Cunningham the Second moaned groggily, slowly returning to the world of the conscious.He tried to put a hand to his face, but his hands were cuffed behind his back, and he came to the realization that things were definitely wrong!His eyes shot open, assessing his situation.He was securely bound to a chair, his perfect hair frazzled and mussed, his ten thousand dollar suit ripped and torn as though he had been dragged over concrete.(He weighed like two hundred pounds!I almost broke down and rented a furniture dolly to get him here!)He looked around with wide, panic-stricken eyes, yelling into the gag filling his mouth.That's when he caught sight of me, laying on the couch nearby.I could tell he had spotted and recognized me, because he turned this shade of red you normally associate with pasta, and you could see the veins on his forehead sticking out!"Oh, you're awake, that's cool.Hey, Reggie, listen..."


I sat up, cracking my neck a bit and stretching.It had been a long eighteen hours waiting around for Sleeping Beauty here to pop back up, and it wasn't a super comfortable couch.He gave me the most hateful glare, and I took that as permission to continue."So I got to thinking about what you said.Normally I wouldn't actually care about getting fired, especially by someone who looks like a model for Gray-Away For Men, but what you said kinda touched a nerve of sorts.You seem to think that money is power, and..."


"I'll kill you, you little shit!My lawyers are going to eat you alive!You won't have a penny, hell, you won't ever be allowed near a penny again, when I'm done with you!I-urmph!Mmmrrrph!"I popped the gag back in, and nodded."See, that's what I'm talking about.You can buy cars and lawyers, and you think that's power.Here, let me show you what power actually is.Shall we watch some TV together, Reggie?Get some of that office worker and boss bonding going on, pardon the bondage pun..."


I clicked on the television, and flipped the channel to C-Span.They were at voting on Resolution 229, which was wonderful timing.I glanced over to Reggie, who was struggling with his bonds and not paying a bit of attention to the television and the bill on county zoning, until...


"Madam Speaker, I'd like to introduce Resolution 230 to the house, a vote to make any crime legal, especially kidnapping," and with that, she looked at the camera and smiled, like she had been paid to do, "so long as Reginald Cunningham the Second is the victim."I wish I had brought a camera to take a picture of his face at that moment!Money really can't buy everything, because life is spontaneous and wonderful and all that, but you know, you can try."Floor is open for debate.""Reginald Cunningham the Second is the biggest waste of oxygen on this planet, and to be honest, I don't know why we're even passing this bill, when we could and should just send him to the electric chair," said our state congressman, a man Reggie had actually shmoozed with in the past, and had pictures to prove it!"It's about sending a message that the kind of willful, bratty behavior that Reginald has been the poster child of will no longer be tolerated in our society..."


We watched for hours, the byplay back and forth, the few bleeding heart humanitarians I hadn't been able to buy the consciences of outright slowing the process down.But in the end, the resolution passed.Unanimously.I looked over to Reggie, who had thoroughly soiled himself and was white as a bedsheet."There you go!Democracy in action.Sure, you have a fancy car.I even brought it out here to the Arizona desert, just for you.You've got a full tank of gas, and fifty thousand dollars in non-sequential currency in the backseat.Hell, here's the handcuff key," and with that, I pressed it into his hand, from which it fell nervelessly.The man was still in shock, and that kinda ruined the flow of my evil villain monologue.I rolled my eyes, and got out some string, and tied the key to his thumb."There.TL;DR version, I can buy democracy itself just for fun on the weekends.How's that for money and power?See ya, Reggie..."


...


"...and I left!From what I had heard after the fact, he lasted right around three hours, and I imagine it took most of that for him to find the gas station he got murdered at, Arizona's a pretty desolate place in the part we were in!""Grandpa?""Yes, Timmy?""You're scary.""I know, Timmy.I know."
