I know that I have a reputation.I know that even other villains are afraid of me, and that behind closed doors they are all too quick to call me a monster.I find this a little ironic.While the various hero and villain associations like to keep their public image very Saturday morning cartoon, I know how things are run behind closed doors.When a villain goes off radar, its not always because theyre in jail and that when the hero association says someone is doing under cover work its typically because they are either dead or in therapy.The best kept secret in both industries is that nobody manages to truly retire.As soon as you hang up the cape youve essentially painted a target on you and everyone you love, and no one from either organization is going to come to save you.I gained my reputation from trying to change that.It was a harsh lesson that my family quickly learned when my father, Ernest Belldin , better known as Dogtor Wolfman , was targeted.Looking back on it, the heroes who decided he was a good person to squeeze for information where probably newbies.After all he was hardly the most dangerous person on the council, especially considering the whole point of him joining the council in the first place was to earn enough money to treat his condition.Honestly in a perfectly world, my father would have been considered a great man, if not a little flawed, man of science.Although his cure didnt completely eliminate our family curse, it did neuter its negative effects enough that its predicted that a few generations down the line it could be considered a genuine super power.Unfortunately my children and I still hold enough lupine characteristics to draw attention.Once it became clear that my father had held onto enough villain tech that he wasnt as easy a target as they were expecting , they started targeting me.While I wasnt thrilled with this development, I was more accepting of this than when they decided to start threatening my children.Although their severed heads were supposed to be more of a warning to other hotshots who try to mess with my family, the Council of villainy took it as my application letter.I tried to avoid getting too involved with them, but when my bills started to stack up, I found the allure of easy cash was too hard to ignore.Unfortunately my first official team up happened to be with the Grand Inquistor.I can assure that whatever the papers say about me, he was a million times worse.I had chosen to work for him because of his anti-hero reputation.However after working with him for about a week, I quickly learned that he was a dangerous sociopath who had a serious hard on for taking revenge on the heroes who he saw as having wronged him by any means necessary.Although working with him was a torturous experience in its own right, I appreciated that it taught me exactly what kinds of things I could live with myself after doing.Unsurprisingly, while I have no issues with killing heroes, torturing children and the elderly is my breaking point.As you can probably guess, I decided to make an example of the Inquistor.While this didnt make me especially popular with the council, it definitely got the word out.Some of the smarter heroes and retirees had an ear out for the gossip on my end.While they fear me, they know that if someone threatens their families, they can come to me
