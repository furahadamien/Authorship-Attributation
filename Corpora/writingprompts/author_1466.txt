George Barnes got out of his truck and headed back to his plantation.Family reunions were never easy, and this one had been the smallest number he'd ever seen.People were afraid.His family, his whole people, his way of life; gone.George walked up the path to his small crop.The plants were already getting huge: broad, almost tropical leaves swaying in the mountain breeze.It wouldn't be too long until harvest time.He was glad; this year's gardens had been nerve-wracking.He'd always known that the white people intended to destroy his family, and end the issue of American ownership once and for all, but he never thought he'd actually live to see the day.At the edge of the garden, he kicked off his sandals and paused a moment to lay a small amount of tobacco on the rock in the southeast corner.It was always gone.Maybe birds were eating it.Maybe it was the wind.It didn't matter.He walked through his garden, talking to his plants, commenting on how big they were getting and how thankful he was for them.They looked okay.No watering today.He drew up a seat on his customary log and reflected on his weekend's activities.His remaining family was scared.Nobody would smoke with him.Tobacco was too precious for yourself, now, they'd said.It can only be used in bundles, and even that was risky.They were torn and tormented: nobody wanted to completely break from tradition, but nobody wanted to get caught.The New Americanism demanded cultural assimilation.Most of the family didn't even want to risk the family gathering.Between the ads and the news, it was enough to make anybody stay home.Now this, he thought.After all we've been through: the disease, the stolen land, the broken promises, the destruction of all that is good in the world - now this.We were too afraid as a people to *be* a people anymore.He smoked a bowl.The tobacco coursing through his veins, he felt strong again, uncertain of the future but determined.He was unbreakable.Let things fall.As long as he was alive, his people's ways would not end.They would not.He got back in the truck and headed back towards town.The realization of responsibility overwhelmed him sometimes.He turned on the radio for a moment; the news was on.A 1989 Honda Civic had been caught on a back road downstate, headed to a former reserve town with a trunk full of tobacco.George knew him.He was the other guy.The news ended and the ad for the UnAmerican Activities Hotline came on.George lingered, and turned the radio off.He wondered if his friend would mention him by name.It didn't matter.He was the last one, now.He drove on.
