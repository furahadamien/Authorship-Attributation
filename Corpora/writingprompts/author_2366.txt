The familiar crack of light hits his eyes as the warmth of a summer sun fills his nostrils.It's 1852 and Tone was standing at the mouth of the Columbia river in the northwestern region of a growing United States.As the pacific ocean crashes upon the shoreline, spray from the rocks hits his cheeks and he wipes the water away, wondering how much of it was ocean water, and how much was the rain from 2047.He feels her tiny hand on his shoulder again, just like always.Her cooling voice feels warm in his ear against the strong coastal winds, There's pain here, the immigrants are pushing westward and the natives are being systematically hunted down., I just wanted some quiet he replied.For years now, he had been trying to find his emotions by leaping back and forth through time, thanks to the device that she gave him on his 25th birthday.It seemed like a lifetime ago.The heat, the impatience, the low hum of circuitry that surrounded the city of Yorktown in 2764, the year they were paired.It had only been about 50 years since her kind had made contact with humans, what was left of them at least.Most had died off from the wars and fallout clouds of the 22nd century.Those that were left saw to it that future generations couldn't react with such insane fury.They had altered their brains to never produce emotions again, in hopes that jealousy, greed, even love would never threaten the human race again.Her species took pity on humans and made an effort to rebuild their emotional response abilities in a more organic fashion, as opposed to invasively altering their genetic makeup as their human ancestors had done.Each human was paired off on their 25th birthday with a cal-yen, one of the aliens that that had arrived 50 years prior.The cal-yen were immortals who traveled the universe looking for entertainment and sport.They were small beings, no larger than a rabbit, but they were able to withstand the heat and pressure of a star at its core, travel faster than light, and even leap through time.Many of them preferred to travel to the inception of a planet and live through its history before interacting with its denizens, and this time was no different.The cal-yen held no personal names, and they generally all shared a similar personality.Tone had anticipated his pair to execute leaps in an organized fashion, starting with the beginning of humankind, and slowly moving forward, but to his surprise, the leaps were determined by him.More specifically, they were determined by small electrical impulses in his brain that hinted at emotional connections.When he tried to reason with a moment too much, the device would activate and a bright light would wash over his vision in a flash, followed always by a deep darkness before he would regain his vision in the new time period.It was quite jarring the first few dozen times.In his first 24 hours he had jumped hundreds of times, each jump opening into a more spectacular landscape of color, sound and temperature.Each one of the first jumps sent him into a variety of locations, all across the timeline of Earth.But in each jump, she was always right behind him, waiting for his arrival.You see, when a cal-yen gives a time travel device to any being, they can only transport them to places that they have been to before, and Tone's pair had already lived out her time on Earth through all of human existence, just like all the other cal-yen.So these locations were just memories of hers that she wanted to share with Tone.The last jump before he had arrived on the coast had been one of the first moments Tone had thought to himself that he may have experienced an emotion.She had brought him to the slums of Chicago on a rainy day in 2047.The screams of a dying opiate user were echoing through the tents and Tone was standing over the corpse of an ancestor of his.Tone had just come from the mansion of his ancestor's brother, where piles of food lay outside of the house, rotting in the summer heat, surrounded by a revolting stench.At the time, Tone was unsure if the stench came from the rotting fruit or the skinny man that was crouched over next to the pile, shoveling the filth into his mouth.Standing over the corpse, Tone now knew that it was the man he had smelled.It was the smell of bile, old dried urine, wet feces, and an impending death.The fluids leaked from the corpse and melded with the rain that puddled at the entrance of the tent.Lightning flashed and thunder clapped as Tone heard an argument coming from outside of the tent.A loud voice yelled,  Bullshit!These were my cans and I'll be damned if some old corpse is going to stop me from collecting! The voice of a small child could be heard from under the booming voice, No, please, my dad didn't leave anything for us, we won't last until the new month.We're already at 2% and he kept stealing our rations the child wept.Tone heard the sound of wet, heavy fists hitting flesh and a man entered the tent, covered in blood.The man couldn't have weighed more than 90 pounds and his facial expression was formed in a way that Tone had begun to recognize as anguish.The man looked straight through him before walking through his body to get to the small pile of canned goods that laid next to his ancestor's corpse.As a time traveler, you can't be seen, heard, or touched by those who are existing in the timeline organically.The child burst into the tent in a fit of tears as Tone heard the voice of his pair, She will be raped by this man and he will promise her two cans of food, but he will only give her a spoonful of one.This is the moment of conception for the next generation in your ancestry.

As Tone stood over the act he remembered the scene in 1974 when another pair of his ancestors created their next generation.They held each other gently, their skin was clean, and they tumbled in clean sheets with their sweat soaking into the fabric.The scene Tone viewed now was filled with dirt and grime, the little girl screamed in pain and the man squeezed her arms so tightly in his attempts to hold her down that her skin began to redden and the dirt on her skin began to smudge under his rain-soaked fingers.The little girl's scream was drowned out by a clap of thunder and Tone saw a small stream of red color snake it's way down her frail dirt-covered thighs.Tone's mind wandered, Perhaps the blood will interfere with the impregnation.But that's impossible since I know that the impregnation was successful.

In less than a fraction of a second, the loose thought of logic was drowned out by the flash of light that preceded the deep darkness, signifying another jump.Tone breathed in the coastal air and wiped the ocean's spray, mixed with the rain from his last jump, away from his brow.That was the first time that he had tricked the device.He had thought about the question as a way to trigger a jump.His pair summarized the emotion that he may encounter in this year in time, but really he was just glad to be alone, away from any other human.A bead of water ran down Tone's cheek and the salt met his lips as he fell to his knees.The oceans were clean in this year, but the taste wasn't like the pacific he was used to.This is pain his pair spoke.There are many types, and you will soon experience them all.You will soon be able to categorize and differentiate them all, but for now, just relish in this, your first emotion.
