ASlothInTime
Everyone's got a period they can't remember.With Oblivion running around wiping memories of anyone who sees a supervillain or commits a crime.It's just normal to be missing some time in your memories.I'd been nothing but an average everyday police officer for as long as I could remember, which to be fair was only the last three years.So when I was sent to investigate the state of an elderly woman who was feared dead, and saw all the newspapers piled up it didn't phase me to see stories I couldn't remember.Until I saw one with my face on it."Destruction rains as Funeral Pyre burns down city hall...again."Looking at it I saw a picture of a myself in a costume, all black and red with my face caught in the middle of what could only be a maniacal laugh.City Hall burning behind me.I started looking through the papers forgetting why I was originally here.The desire to know my past was all consuming.Every story I read that included this Funeral Pyre was of a supervillain of massive power, capable of controlling flames like a part of his own body, and with zero regard for human life.At first I couldn't believe that that was me.I was a police officer, I protected life!But the more I read the more a headache grew.Soon I felt like my head would explode, and then it did.Not in a literal explosion but a metaphorical explosion of memories.Everything I'd forgotten came flooding back.I knew how I got my powers... and why I used them.Years of rage and hatred flew back into my head, and a new hatred formed with them.A hatred for Oblivion, how dare he steal my past from me, make me forget my very powers!But unfortunately for him, he doesn't know that I remember, and as an officer of the law, I'll see him again.And this time.I'll kill him.
