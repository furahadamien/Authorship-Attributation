You use your knowledge on your dream to make a better life for other Hominid Primate, you teach the youth what you know, you help them all become more advance in technology and have a easier way of life.You are respected among your pears and become their leader, later when you die everyone cries for you, but you have left a better future for your offspring.Later on you wake up in your bed and realise that it was all in a dream from drinking some spoiled milk  , but it all felt so real that you question it having been a dream, because of this you fall into depression, and live a layd back life without putting any effort to change things or in anything because you think this is all a dream too and end up beign homeless and spend your time drinking alcohol and doing other drugs, and asking for change to buy a beer , later on in your 43's you end up having a midlife crisis, you regret everything you've done and what you haven't done, but you don't have much time left, you know that nothing matters, but deep in your soul everything screams in agony, later on you die at 50 because of your bad life style, but then you wake up again and you are a bird now you were hallucinating after inhaling this toxic gas for a bit  and it all feels like it was a dream and you end up with the conclusion that reality is just an illusion and that nothing is real, but things are real at the moment, it all depends on how you perceive things, and you found out that its better to pretend that things do matter because thinking that nothing matters will get you nowhere and will make you miserable.You decide that you want to live every life to the fullest from now on.[END]
