It wasn't the firing that got me, it was the way Chuck did it.Sure I had been goofing off a bit at work, but who wouldn't after being the secret heir to the Buffet/Musk fortune.There was only so long I could pretend to care.My boss walked over and said "Sorry chum, I'm going to have to let you go."He  said CHUM.He knows I hated that word.I had told him that  three times in the last 2 months and he had apologized each time and said he wouldn't use it anymore with me.I am sure he used it on purpose when he let me go to be petty.That's ok.If he wants to play the petty game, let's play the freaking petty game.&#x200B;

Chuck was a fanatic about his car, a white 2013 Hurst Edition Chevy Trans AM.He lovingly hand washed and waxed it every weekend.At work, he parked at the empty far end of the lot to prevent door dings, which I respected.He wasn't one of the d-bags that double parks in spots other people would likely use.Since I knew Chuck loved his car so much, I decided this would be the start to my fun.&#x200B;

I hired Tanya, a very discrete logistics expert with a ton of contacts as my assistant.She would interact with everyone else to keep my identity secret.Through her we hired a team consisting of 2 ex-Mossad agents, 1 ex-CIA surveillance specialist, 2 automotive body shop experts, a master forger, 2 Hollywood special effects experts, a mechanic, and a couple of people to buy supplies.&#x200B;

We had the surveillance guy get tons of pictures of  Chuck's car.He made sure to get everything in high-res detail.Not just the car, but also copies of all the paperwork in the glove compartment and center console like insurance, registration and the single crumpled receipt from Target that was far under his seat that Chuck hadn't noticed but we had.&#x200B;

Through a shell company, we bought 10 white 2013 Hurst Edition Chevy Trans AMs.The team worked together to make all the cars look identical to Chuck's.The same paint, same VIN, the right general mileage, the radio presets, the locks, all the paperwork in place.We even got the slight wear on the steering wheel, driver's side window sill, and seat to match perfectly.&#x200B;

Time to put the plan into action.&#x200B;

Tonya hired an actor to portray a potential high-value client who scheduled an appointment with Chuck.This way we'd know when he would be in a conference room and away from his office.Chuck's office has a view of his car, and we wanted to make sure we'd have at least 5 minutes to do the work without him seeing it.&#x200B;

When we got the signal that Chuck was meeting with our actor, one of the ex-Mossad guys patched a loop into the company's surveillance cameras that covered the parking lot.We had breached the company's security two weeks ago, but all we cared about was making sure we could access the cameras and had audio access to the security room.We even patched up a few other security holes we found to make sure nobody else could break into the network and cause a security audit.&#x200B;

Our two panel vans pulled up near Chuck's car and parked to block the view.The team did did a quick scan of his car to see if anything changed and made sure we got the mileage right on our first decoy car.We loaded up Chuck's car into one van, and unloaded the decoy car into place.Before leaving, one of the auto-body guys made a big deep scratch, down to the metal in the side of the driver's side door of the decoy car.&#x200B;

Once the team was away, we set the surveillance cameras back to normal, and I watched the video feed myself at 5:30, when I knew Chuck would soon be walking out to his car.The view wasn't great since he was parked so far from the building, but I could see him run the last few steps to his car when he saw the big scratch.Chuck spent a few minutes looking at the scratch and then called his friend Tom, who owns an autobody shop.Of course we had a tap on Chuck's phone.Tom said he could bring the car tomorrow morning and he'd have his best guy fix the paint, but it would probably take 2 days.&#x200B;

That night, Chuck slept extra well since we had added a small bit of benzodiazepine to Chuck's scotch.During the night, we stealthily switched the decoy car and Chuck's car in his garage.&#x200B;
