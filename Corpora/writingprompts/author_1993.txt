I can't help but stare blankly at the person before me.So this was the creator of the clues, the mind behind the original designs."I see your plans left you without a leg and an ear, shit.""Aye, and you seem pretty intact.""I saw your drawings, they were almost there.I had to reajust a few things, and we had already moved on to Nuclear Fusion, so the energy source was much more powerful.""Why does your voice sound funny?""It's the translator I had installed before I left.Allows me to communicate with anyone.I've swapped out most of my parts.The meatsuit conflicted with my desire to spread world peace so I destroyed most of it.""I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about...
