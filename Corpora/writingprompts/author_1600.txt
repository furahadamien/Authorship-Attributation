I wake up.Wow suddenly I know everything.I turn to my monkey mate, Peepo."Hey you know that thing we always try to harness after a lightning strike?"Peepo: You mean fire?Me: Yeah... you got to rub sticks together.Peepo: We've tried that, like a bunch.It's really not that easy.Me: Maybe lets strike flint and steel?Peepo: What's flint?Me: It's a stone.Peepo: We've got stones.There's a ton of stones around.Me: It's like a specific type of stone...I'm only sort of sure what it looks like.Peepo: ..... what's steel?Me: It's a metal alloy made of iron.Peepo: what's iron

Me: It's a stone.Peepo: Again with the stones.What does an iron stone look like.Me: I'm not sure.In fact I think it only makes up part of a stone.Peepo: You really don't have any useful information.Me: Shut up and start gathering rocks.&#x200B;
