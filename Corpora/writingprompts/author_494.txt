As the voice echoes in my ears, I think of the possibilities.My life, finally free to live outside.My friends amazed as I command a dancing cloud.My bullies, writhing in pain on the ground.Then a new thought occurs to me.I command the world's pollinators.Dim visions of nations bowing before me, begging me to allow their crops to grow.Universal adoration.Riches.My choice of lovers.Where's my phone?I need to call Ben.He always helps perfect my plans.Where's my phone?I turn around.Where's my house?Why is everything so blurry?I feel dizzy.I'll command them to fix that too!-------------

The hum of gentle machines fills the room as the parents cling to each other, looking down at their gently shaking son in the bed."He almost seems like he's laughing to himself..." muses the father; "He almost looks happy."Looking up, the doctor replies."Symptoms of his allergies include hallucinations.He may not even have noticed the sting as he slipped into the coma."Weeping, the parents watch their son as the beeping of the machines slows to a stop.
