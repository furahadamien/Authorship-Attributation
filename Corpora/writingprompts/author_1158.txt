The area reminded me of an LSD trip, the ones I had so often in my wild and reckless youth.Older now, old enough to be on a different plane from the living, the hazy background that I couldn't pin down or fully relate to the world I just left filled me with a ghostly nostalgia.I had been sixty-four.Not the oldest life I could have lived, but I didn't necessarily want to hang on for eighty plus years, watching my body slowly deteriorate until it couldn't hold me upright.A life of exposure to various gases and many kinds of smoke, the life common to Chemistry majors, had given me lung cancer.They gave me a fifty percent chance of survival.The cancer metastasized to my brain and I was dead six months later.Survived by my wife and only son.How long had I been gone?A minute?A month?Ten years?I couldn't really tell now.Time was hazy and distant and I couldn't fully grasp onto it.I blinked, or something equivalent to a blink, and suddenly floating in the hazy space around me was something like an antiquated Bible.It was a huge book, adorned with gold print, a leather bound looking spine.I reached out (did I even have arms?)and latched onto it, pulling open the cover.My name was inscribed on the top of the first page, beneath it the classic Latin inscription "in memento mori," meaning "in memory of death."The index was vast and confusing, with headers like "Where To Go to College" and then a list beneath it of all the places I had considered nearly fifty years ago.A few were italicized, and I flipped to my second choice.It read, "Had he gone to this school, his life would have been significantly different, thus this section is dubbed to be a CLASS 4 EVENT.In his first year, he would have met a women named KAREN in his Rhetoric of the Self class.This woman is designated as CLASS 4 SOULMATE, whereas the woman he actually married was designated CLASS 2 SOULMATE.He would have switched to and English major (see the header on POSSIBLE CAREER PATHS) and never obtained lung cancer.If this path had been followed MARRIAGE TO KAREN, THREE CHILDREN, and MOVING STATES, his ending would have been CLASS 4, HAPPY."My soul felt naked.Memories that weren't mine from life suddenly sprang into my brain, foreign yet familiar, like a bad aftertaste.I saw Karen's face, smiling at me as we held hands and walked through a grove of trees unknown to me.I saw the birth of my second child, a daughter we named Melody, as she cried her way into an existence that never was.If I'd had a physical form, which I couldn't tell if I did or didn't have at this point, it would have been sobbing.With ravenous curiosity, I flipped through more and more of this book, this cursed and blessed book.I read more and more of what could have beens, what should have beens, what I did wrong and what I did right, and what was fine but could have been better.So many new and foreign memories entered my mind, memories of hundreds, maybe thousands of possible outcomes.Finally, only one section remained.The one section that I'd saved for last because it felt right somehow, some instinct within me told me not to read it until the end.Memories mixed and intermingled and I began to feel my selfhood loosen.I couldn't remember if I'd married Karen or Mary or Josie, I couldn't remember if I'd had three children or none, nothing felt real.The book itself began to fragment and split, pages drifting from the spine and becoming as hazy as this surreal plane.I ripped open to the final section "CLASS 5 HAPPINESS ENDING."There was one sentence."THERE IS NO USE DWELLING ON THE PAST.YOU WILL NOW TRANSITION."With a blink my form dissipated and I was fully gone.
