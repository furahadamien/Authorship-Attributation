Buzzing broke through her dream of a Turkish bath and Dagmar groaned, rolling on the mat softening her cot for her coat.Ringing filled her dingy, one-room flat.The sound seemed to bounce stronger off the boarded-up window.After fumbling for a few moments, she finally sat up on the cot and drew her phone.The floor above her creaked, a shuffled pace like somebody half-asleep stumbling to the bathroom.Dozens of notifications, mostly from numbers Dagmar didn't know, appeared.An official message from the Knights of Sallu held on top.Dagmar sat straight up.Aleksander preferred to send requests through a personal mass email.The official server sat unused almost all year long, only sending out training notices every six months.There hadn't been a catastrophic Twilight Incident since the reign of House Capet, so the official channels hadn't been needed outside of training.Opening, it held a terse text message telling her to prepare for the minions of the gloom, ending on 'Do not look at the moon'.The floor above her creaked.Swiping back to the message center, she noticed Flynn, one of the regulars at the sporting goods store.Hoping this wasn't another round of begging for dates, she opened it to see "Care to go for a walk in the park?The moon is beautiful tonight."Trashing that message, she saw dozens of variations on "look outside, it's a beautiful night".Some mentioned the moon, others did not.Then Dagmar paused."Wait, the moon... tonight's the night of the new moon."Hauling the chest out from under the cot, she changed and strapped on half a dozen blades before shrugging on her armored coat.Wary of Aleksander's warning, she called the nearest knight for backup.Ferrier was always available to help out.When his phone went to voicemail, she tried again.Then again.And again.When voicemail came up a fourth time, Dagmar closed the call, her mouth dry.Something heavy crashed to the floor in the room above her, ceramic clattering.She drew a machete and crept to the door, opening it a crack.At this time of night, the complex's inner courtyard should be dark.Sickly yellow light shone down from the open sky, and for a moment it seemed like every shadow crawled.***
Constructive criticism welcome.

Phillip Cabot Swarthmore the Third sat down in the library, the shuffle of graduate students and other elderly leafing through heavy tomes whispering through the otherwise silent, red brick building.Finishing the last article of the paper, he folded it and set it aside for the next one in his neat stack.His heartbeat jumped and for a moment he thought he looked through a timepiece.The hair was a solid black instead of speckled with gray, the skin around the eyes and mouth smooth instead of his wrinkled visage, but Phillip knew his own face even if the one on the front page smirked out of a man wearing a colorful polyester suit."Lord Energon Disappears Night Before Anticlimactic Battle with Interpol" ran in bold across the top of the page.Spellbound, Phillip scanned through the article, turning page after page, reading about the proclamation from Null Recall that the villain was no more.It went on to detail his heinous acts, vaporizing whole city blocks of Georgetown, and then the reporter digging into the supervillain's mundane past to being held back in the fourth grade as Stinky Frostheimer.Phillip took a deep sip of coffee from his coffee thermos.Capping it with a chuckle, he put away the newspapers and strode out of the library, stopping to return a friendly wave to the librarian at the front."Have a good day, Mister Swarthmore," she said.Phillip uncapped his thermos for another sip of coffee.*Stinky Frostheimer.No wonder I turned to villainy*.
