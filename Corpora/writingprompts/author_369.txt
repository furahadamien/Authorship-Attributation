He swiped the beaded sweat off his handsome Carmel forehead.Was what he'd just read *true*?It couldn't be.He read the last lines of the letter that was placed on his nightstand over and over."I hope you enjoyed your vacation.Be ready to go at daybreak.Be prepared to say goodbye to the man you were.This is where your **real** job begins.-- JFK"

Impossible, isn't it?The handwriting...It was uncanny.Could this be an elaborate joke from his darling Michelle?Obama's sleep crusted eyes pulled against the crusted pupils towards the window overlooking the resort he and his family had been enjoying.The sun lazily stretched over the brightening horizon.Suddenly, the door of the door exploded inwards, spraying splintery debris over the presidential suite.Michelle shrieked awake, kicking the covers off and exposing Barack's slick body-- clad in small dollar bills and crossbones.So, the letter is real, whatever it is, Obama pondered as the tear gas filled the room.White smoke poured into the room as the president clutched his former First Lady for what would be the last time.Darkness.Obama felt the hefty weight of his eyelids.Feeling poured into his limbs and they tingled awake, sticking him with pins at every twitch.His eyes fluttered open.A hand came down, blocking the light that had been blinding him.Obama's eyes widened and his breath left his body is a sharp exhale.John Fucking Kennedy stood before him, and he would not be wise to leave him hanging, as his look indicated.Barack grasped his hand and stood face to face with a man thought to be dead or in Nevada with Elvis Presley himself."Mr. President," Obama managed."Mr. President," John replied."I think it's time you got an explanation."Obama looked around the room.He had been laid out on a stainless steel table.Otherwise, the room was completely empty, save for a door and the ghost.Barack nodded.It was all he could do."Follow me."As they walked toward the door, it opened for the middle, circular metal spiraling outward.They proceeded through a long hallway, lit periodically from the floor and ceiling by what seemed to be magic.Their feet clattered on the metal as Obama awaited the promised explanation.He found, however, he couldn't bring himself to press the man he followed.He couldn't even believe he was really there-- let alone the fact he could *speak* to him.They came to the end of the hall and John turned."The Russians have done it.I'm sorry to say, we have been compromised."They looked each other in the eyes, solemnly.John turned and punched **1616** into the keypad at his side.The door began to open."Gentleman," a voice called out.The voice was new but familiar, like a dream.Smoke poured through the doorway, and as it thinned a silhouette became evident.The outline of broad shoulders, the frayed hairs traced his darkened  jawline, the sleek, velvet top hat.A tall man stepped forward, half of his wrinkled head glaring a bright.In the center of the silver that consumed half of his face was what seemed to be a bionic eye."I want you."
