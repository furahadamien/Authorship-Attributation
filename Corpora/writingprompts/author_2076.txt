"Ay!Use dat spellar 'Arry!Blimey!demun'or is coming.Nuff said, yeah?"The Redhead's cockney shout made Harry spring up to his feet.He pointed his syringe at the approaching police."Awright geeezzaa!Adavakedava.Sorted mate. "The cops stopped.They looked at each other exchanging confused glances."Rattle an' Hum on Harry quick let's escape.OK?"Hermione said.The three huddled under a cloak."Demun'or can't see us now.OK?"Hermione was proud of herself."Blimey!Stupid girl.They can still hear us now, OK?"Ron snapped."Oy, you kids?Where do you live?Come here."The kids made a run for it."Quickey, eh maybe we can make it to da Hogwarts shield.The demun'or can't enter there OK."

A homeless guy came out of a cul-de-sac as the kids sped through the backalleys."Howdy officers," he greeted them.They shoved him aside and raced after the kids."Ow no!They broke through the shield?The headmaster is fallen."Harry stopped in grief.The other two tried to drag him on but the cops had already caught up to them."What are yew gonna do ter us you soulless monsters."They dragged them back to their car."Get you kids into juvies, where you'll go through deaddiction.""If you do that we won't tell you how to catch you know who," Hermine said, some sense wearing into her."What did you say?""That's right.The one who must not be named.The one who sells hallucinogens to us kids- the lynchping.Getting us small fries will do you now, would it?"The officers stopped."You mean you can lead us to this...you-know-who?"The three nodded.The officers were tempted by the proposal.Getting some jacked up kids from the curb or nailing the big daddy?They quickly exchanged glances and decided on the latter."Alright now, punks.Maybe if you quit your drugs and get us this guy, maybe we'll try some lenience on your chargesheet."The three kids were let off.Their new mission was to find and destroy Tom Riddle, who went by the street name Voldermort.
