"What a fucked up world it is," I mumbled to myself while skimming a headline about the discovery of another super gifted teen that was going to be groomed for superhero stardom."Some just get born with these insane capabilities and elemental control, and others, well they are born with allergies. "My diet was monotonous to say the least.They say everything is poison in the right amount.For me the right amount was just lower.For everything.Peanuts literally cyanide.Drinking milk like pouring acid down my throat.Going out only with a mask and a protective suit because of the pollen.How people used to stare."Thank god I dont go out anymore."As I tried to close the tab I was clickbaited into another headline."The 12 supervillains you already forgot about (you know they have!)".A little bit of schadenfreude always cheered me up.The usual suspects were all there.Titano, Waterboy, General Stor.All caught.Their memories wiped clean.Then I got to number 1."Florak - no fuel no fury.One scary biologist.Only succumbed to Superwiper Cerebrother after it was revealed his control of any living vegetation originated from his nutrition: mainly peanuts and dairy products."A strange feeling took a hold of me, as if I was really close to solving a difficult puzzle.I looked around my plastic appartment.Stood up, walked around in a circle.Sat down again.Nothing organic anywhere.I was sweating heavily."Florak", I muttered."Florak!"I slipped into my protective suit and put on my mask.I ran out to find a breakfast place and ordered the largest bowl of granola I could find.Kill to bird with one stone.This is my comeback.Avenge myself and destroy those arrogant teenager with their perfect lives."Fuck it."I ate the bowl of granola and immediately the feeling was overwhelming.It felt as if a fire was ignited from deep inside of me.It felt as if my muscles were instantly growing.Especially in my neck.I can't breathe.
