"A-mer-ica, A-mer-ica God shed his grace on thee.."
"Jesus Joey, turn that crap off.Don't you ever get tired of listening to one song over and over?My skull is about to pop open for Christs sake.""Sorry Tony, I'll turn it off."I look over at Joey as he walks slowly across the room we're in and shuts of the CB radio.I roll my eyes so he can't see but I also smile a little.Not because the annoying music has stopped but because I know what that music means.The same song has been broadcasting for over a week now on all American radio waves.I even hear it in my sleep.The song is the first step in letting the remaining Americans know it's time.It's time to return to the world.Joey stares out small window in the bunker, his face lit up by the soft glow of the moon.He turns and asks me "bro are you ready for tomorrow?What are you going to do first?""Old Mary told me that people use to do this thing called dancing, I wonder if that's something the rulers decided to keep?""Don't call them that."I tell him as I go back to reading my book."Their not rulers.Their human just like us both but with way more ass to stick their heads into.They got us into this mess to begin with.50 years of isolation for a war that could of been averted.A war started on fear and hate, something any parent teaches their child is wrong.""Well bro you know from historical readings that America at that time wasnt the most inclusive.Racial tensions were high.Gun control wasn't even a thought and they believed global warming to be faux news.""Fake news Joey, not faux.""How do you know?"Joey asks."Because I was there.I was there at the beginning of all this.I had a first hand look into the heart of humanity and...."
"And what?"Asks Joey.I look up from the page I've been trying to read for an hour.I keep forgetting that my baby brother is just that, a baby.He doesnt know the horrors of that war.He doesn't know how it really started or how many lives, resources and knowledge we lost during and after the war.A war that forced us to flee underground from fear of bombings.Two straight weeks of global bombing.Two weeks of death.Two weeks of pain.It took two weeks for us to bomb the world back into the stone age."And..." I begin to say."Warning.Warning.Warning."The loud speaker blares from the outside.So loud against this silent night.Joey looks over in my direction.Panic, fear, and ten other emotions cross his dark brown face."Tony what is this, what's going on?"Joey screams above the noise."It's war Joey.It's always war.Seems like someone doesn't want the Americans to rejoin the world."I peer out the window just in time to see the planes drop unknown soliders out of its cargo bay."It's always war."*Sorry this is my first time posting.I just wanted to add a little side story.This is a great post btw.Keep it going.
