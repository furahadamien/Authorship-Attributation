With every assault men in brown uniforms would fall to the Swedes, like sand being washed from a beach by the tide of blue coated soldiers.Each shot of the cannons releasing flashes of blue and red as they smashed against the wall as if cracking open the delusions of Tomas and letting in reality.The man he treated had never had the same face twice.It had gone through so many changes, from young homeless children to even Charles XIII once, but it would never once again be the face Tomas truly wished he could save.This particular time the face had been dismembered by a round that was developed centuries after the battle.One fragment had lodged itself into and upper section of the mans throat.The young medic pulled out his knife, and with the steadiness of someone far more experienced then Tomas in 1648 had been, moved his knife to make an incision, before a voice began to break through the boundaries of his delusions.James.JAMES! The Swedish soldier yelled as he grabbed at the knife.Yet when he looked up the man in the blue coat the Swedish soldier had left and instead the man who had long ago been known as Tomas was staring into the eyes of another paramedic.That knifes not sanitary.

James looked down at the ancient, weathered knife of the Czech army.Had he brought the old thing to work with him today?James soon decided however that he could ponder that when a man wasnt dying before him.Yes of course youre right. He replied.With a scalpel now instead of a combat knife the tracheotomy was performed.The ride to the hospital however left significantly more room to think as much of the work needed to be done to sustain the now stable mans life was done by his coworker as insisted, likely now suspicious of Jamess competence.Tomas could now go back through all the thoughts that he had every time he experienced the hallucination.What had his friends original face looked like?Most of the early faces from that hallucination were forgotten, even that if the great Carolus Rex he had now superimposed the face from a painting onto for lack of a better image.Why was he still alive?This question never got anywhere of course, and it never would.And why of course did he keep reliving the moment of the end of what had been the end of a lifetime of war for his friend but merely a fraction of an eternity for him?
