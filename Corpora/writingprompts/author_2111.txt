I am a rational person.Some could argue otherwise, but I assure you I am as rational as anybody could expect to be in my situation.I have schizophrenia.Auditory hallucinations, but I'm doing fine.Well  maybe it isn't fine, but I've been managing it.Things have been working out well now that Ive got my own place.Its quiet, which is good fot me.I dont have any delusions or detachment from reality.I just hear her.She's never been hurtful or especially negative to me, which I am quite lucky for, but hearing her has caused me immense distress.I cannot overstate how difficult it has been for me to maintain healthy relationships.Even with a steady diet of abilify and ativan, my antipsychotics and anxiety meds.I just cannot do it.I am simply not capable of it.So I live alone.I am entirely isolated from others.Theres this gap too wide for anyone to cross between me and everyone else.I know that nobody would ever understand me or know how I feel.Except for her.She's been inside my head, seen it all, and stuck around me this whole time.Even now, I still hear her.It wasn't until I had just gotten off of the bus on my way to my appointment with my shrink that I'd ever been scared of her.She'd always been so soothing and comforting to me.I could always turn to her and she would be there for me.We would have full conversations where she would help me and there were times I would help her.I just need you to understand, I had never been scared of her before.Not once.Well, that day I was fucking terrified.So, I start telling myself: "You're a rational person, this is a hallucination."I was trying some of my grounding techniques, but she fucking scared me.I had never been so vulnerable.I had been by myself for the past 6 years and then- out of fucking nowhere- I was more vulnerable and open to someone then I ever have been.And all it took was her saying "Turn around, did I find you?"It was different.It was the only time she'd ever made reference to definitively being somewhere.This was the only chance I had to know for sure if she was real.I needed to know.Like I said, I was being as rational as anyone could be in my situation.I turned my shoulder and saw a girl, roughly my age, walking behind me.Her eyes widened, and it seemed like she was about to say something before I turned back around.At first I thought she had just been some stranger scared I was about to rob her, so I just kept walking.'Fine.Now you know she isnt real.Let it go.'I said to myself, walking briskly away.I didnt dare check my shoulder again before I heard her again."Holy shit.It is you.Hang on-" 

I panicked.It seemed like they were getting worse.So I hastily slung my backpack over my shoulder and begun to dig into the small pocket on the front for my meds.I grabbed my water bottle and sat on the bench, certain I was losing it.I stared at my pills, thinking I could take more than normal in hopes of this deafening my ears to her, so to speak.I thought about running.But, neither of these seemed particularly helpful.I put my pills back in my bag and sat for a momebt.I heard her speak for the first time.Not just thoughts stuck in my head, but somebody's voice coming from outside."I'm sorry.I didn't mean to scare you.Are you okay?"The girl I'd seen sat down next to me.Her posture was open, and she looked at me empathetically.'It's you.'It was all I could muster, but I was sure she would understand.She always understood me.The corner of her lips pulled into a small smile.And she nodded reassuringly.I stared at her.She was exactly how I'd pictured her.Maybe I'd actually known.'She really is beautiful, that hadn't just been a teenaged pipedream afterall.'I thought to myself.Or us, I suppose.Her smile widened, and her cheeks reddened."Thank you.It's nice to finally meet you in person.'Now, it seemed it was my turn to blush.I laughed nervously."Why did you come find me?"I asked her.I suppose I didn't have to speak at all, but it was a habit you wouldn't think of until you don't need to."Well, I wanted to know if you were actually real too."I smiled.I couldn't say how long we spent on that bench the first day we met, catching up as old friends do.All I know is I had never taken such a risk, in being so open and vulnerable to someome else before, and there is not a single decision I have ever been so glad I made.It was the first time in my life, I  wasn't alone.
