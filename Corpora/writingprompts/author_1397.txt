A shadow hung over Hope as she wandered through the rubble and ruins of what remained of human civilization.With every step she made, Death followed closely, watching her with his never-blinking twin pits of darkness.Hope shivered, and for a moment, the cold breeze that had slipped down her neck felt...*alive.*

Death watched as Hope pulled her hood, a ragged coth, over her head and cinched it tighter.Warily, Hope continued down the worn road.Cracked and weathered with time, it stretched into a ruined city, its name lost with the passage of time.Most of the buildings and towers had toppled over, but some still remained standing.They leaned and hung precariously in the sky, threatening to topple with only the slightest breath.But the world was barren, lifeless and silent.There was not a single soul, not a single breath to be felt, except for one girl by the name of Hope.And Death was there when she was born.He was there because there were two lives for him to take.----

"Come on Clara!Almost there!"the man shouted, his voice resonating into the silent grey sky.The man was on his knees, his hands ready to receive a new life and behind him stood Death.Clara had cried and screamed for hours through the night, and when the sun finally rose, there was silence.Clara had given birth."Its a girl... Its a girl, Clara!"the man cried as he wrapped the baby in a blanket.But Clara didn't respond."Clara?"the man crawled forward on his knees.With one arm cradling the baby, he checked Clara's pulse.Death had taken Clara.The man had cried as he realized this.Then he stopped himself when he noticed that the baby wasn't crying.Death had watched as the man began to panic, shaking the baby gently when she didn't respond.Then putting his ear to her tiny chest, the man listened.There was no heartbeat.Only the sound of his own breathing could be heard.Devastated, the man had screamed a raw and guttural cry.Despair had settled into his own heart, and the man was ready.Ready to meet Death.Still holding onto to the still-born baby, the man clutched a knife and brought it to his chest.He would plunge it directly into his own heart.Death saw this.He saw that with the man's death, there would be no life left.It would be the end of Death."Wait," Death whispered.The man flinched as he heard Death speak, and thought it was the wind, but there was no wind, only a cold merciless mist."There is still hope," Death said.Shocked by the words, the man had dropped his hand to his side, the knife still firmly in his grip.Death bent down, low enough that his breath could be felt on the baby.*It's not too late*, Death thought.Death extended his bony fingers, and touched her heart.Then there was a heartbeat.It was faint but it was there.*All she needed was a little nudge*,  thought Death.The baby let out a breath, then breathed.Then she began crying, wailing loudly into the silent world.The man dropped his knife as he smiled, then began laughing.He was overjoyed."Thank you.Thank you Lifegiver!"the man cried.Then he looked down at the baby."Your name is Hope," the man whispered.Death stood up, straightening his back as he watched.Today he had given life, and now in his hands, he held hope.-----

"*Life*, I would kill for some canned peaches," grumbled Hope.In her hands were canned beans.She had stumbled her way into an abandoned supermarket.Now she was stuffing her bag full of canned beans as she continued onto the next aisle.*Hopefully, somewhere within this barren world, there were canned peaches*, thought Death.----
