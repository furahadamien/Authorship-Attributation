The sun seems brighter than usual.My skin a little rougher.I don't have my macbook anymore, the macbook was just a dream.My partner Chinu lies next to me.I remember everything.I storm out of our hut and begin rallying the group "WAKAWAKAWAKAWAKA!"I bang on the hollow antelope head."Why you wake us up Chinto?!!!"The men rush out from their tents."WAKAWAKAWAKA!WAKAWAKAWAKA!"The entire tribe erupts in confusion."Silence!!!!I had a vision of another life, it was terrible!We must change our ways!Live better lives!."The tribe stared at me skeptically, elder Piput stepped forward."Hut not good?!Boar meet not good!?"He banged on his chest."Yes boar meat and huts are good elder Piput!""WAKAWAKAWAKA!"The tribe continued to bang on the hollow boar husks."Listen to me please!"Bending toward the ash I removed a carbon block.I began to draw a long line along the cave wall.The line soon became a giant box, then a large grid.I drew each of our symbols into each box including the females."Piput!Tell the women to come out and see.All of my tribe stared in confusion.My partner Chinu demanded to know what this was."I Chinto of the lower salt flats, the third and only living son of my father Shakaso!This square here is my square!I like boar leg, stars and the skull of the antelope as my drum!I drew a small line under my square, this is my relationship status!It's complicated!""WAKAWAKAWAKAWAKAWAKA!"The entire tribe erupted in confusion."Wachana, this is your box!"I exclaimed."I am poking it to show that I have interest!""WAKAKAWAKAWAKAWAKA!"The entire tribe drew charcoal bricks and began making their cavebook profiles as I took Wachana into my hut and showed her the 69.I single handedly set back human civilization by 6000 years.And in this land of innocence, I am the corrupt king.
