They watched from across the street as I pulled one of my 'death sticks' to my mouth.It isn't like how it was a few years ago; then they tried to hide their staring.I lit it and took a drag then let out a smoke ring that would have impressed if it had come from an E-cig or pot.I smoked it down to the end and threw it on the ground just to see their reactions.Pleasant as always: playful jeers and helpful advice for my lifestyle.I just walk away, ignoring them.It's a sunny day with minimal clouds; the holoAds are almost invisible.I can barely make out a cartoon picturization of my face with a nice red X over it.From what I can tell it's being used to pitch a special edition of chips, promising to donate %5 of the editions profits to cancer research.Fun!I'm the figure head of cancer now.Ever since the guy in Germany quit last month I've been the last smoker on Earth.I've got to say it's quite interesting having more people recognize the name of Laren Volk than Osama Bin Laden.Kind of profitable too.It turns out people love to keep up with everything the person they most despise has to say.My blog has just about 3 million (30,567 until!)~~haters~~ followers.A street ad changed as I walked by.'Stay away and you'll make my day!'it said with a picture of a cigarette and laid out in vintage meme format.I can't help but laugh at how people pay thousands for ad block and I get it for free.I pull out another cig and light it, really just to spite the sign.My walk ends at my apartment.I ignore the photographers across the street and enter my apartment.I put my cigarette out on an ash try that literally had my name on it and walk up to my room.Two flights of stairs later, and a few neighbors who pretended not to see me, I reach the sanctuary that is my room.Everything is nice and tidy, as I left it, and I pet Rufes, my mid-aged Labrador, who'd dutifully met me at the door.He doesn't seem to mind the smell or really anything to do with what makes me a tumor of society.I wish society would take note.After I fixed myself lunch, and another session of petting, I went to my computer and began the days entry.'Hey haters,-' it began and then went on to include all the small mundane things I'd done in the morning.I wrote about coffee, people I saw, a guy who was cute, policies of the latest president, and really anything but cigarettes.When I'd finished and posted it I watched as the comments rolled in.'u need to stop smkin'

'kys.your the worst of humanity'

'I like that coffee too!''Why do you smoke anyway?'And so on.I eventually had to just turn it off and found Rufes."Do you like me Rufes?"Rufes started to pant."Good boy.Good boy."I proceeded to cry into Refes's fur for hours.
