From within the ambulance shed came yelling which was muffled but loud enough to bring nurses from the hospital adjacent.Several EMTs and a paramedic stood outside the building shaking their heads at the terrible noises coming from within.The nurses walked up with concerned looks on their faces.Whats happening, asked one of them to the paramedic.Dimitiri has gone off the deep end, she responded.Really? There was a look of disbelief from the nurses who were used to Dimitris calm attitude and efficient work.He was a legend at the hospital for his knowledge and ability, but the fact that he could proceed through the worst scenarios with calm was perhaps the most impressive thing of all.What happened, one of them asked.We got privatized, said an EMT.They just cut our pay, lengthened our hours, cut our benefits, service is now more expensive, coverage area got bigger while they are removing one of the units, want us to focus on transports instead of emergency medicine, and people will die because we cant be there to help them.

From within the confines of the ambulance building came the shout... I havent seen anything this barbaric and stupid since the fucking dark ages!
