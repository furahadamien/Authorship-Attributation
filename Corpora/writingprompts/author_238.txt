The sun light was blinding, colors are vivid and alien, my heart has taken a life of its own by beating a marathon.Dark Day, or The Great Blinding, was a preemptive strike by the Weeping Angels.Our species are blind and had to adapt to a lifestyle of chaos and crime as our species disappeared in time.Without vision, there has been no adapted method of catching crimes, persecution, or rescue.I realized I had stopped moving, and I had to continue forward to the person ahead of me.Two years of blindness will aide in my disguise as I stumble forward.Methods of travel were quickly improvised.People moving in groups, hands on each others shoulders, or holding hands.Those who are travelling alone have a stick to tap in front of them.Acoustics and touch has become our vision.At least, until now.I glance around as I walk in tandem with the person in front of me.The walls, floors, ceiling, have all been painted with the message Dont Let Them Know You Can See. A sharp crack split the ambient mumble of the crowd.I betrayed another glance and saw the back of an Angel prodding a man; we were enslaved.The man in front of me turns suddenly and we are going between two buildings, a dark alleyway.As I march forward, a voice speaks directly to me in a low tone.The shock of someone speaking directly to me renders me frozen, and I cant even turn to see the owner of the voice.There is a lot to explain, and an awful lot of running to do, but can I ask you something?AmIaginger?!
