729 days.Thats how long its been since the Great Blinding, although if you ask me theres nothing great about it.Whats so great about losing your sight?At least I wasnt the only one suffering.&#x200B;

I was in prison when The Great Blinding happened.Whoever was pulling the strings chose the worst possible moment, we were having lunch.You can imagine how that turned out.Those first few moments were madness.Someone screamed, someone got stabbed, someone got shot.&#x200B;

Immediately shit hit the fan I dove under the table.I stayed there until I heard The Voice.It came from everywhere and nowhere at the same time and as soon as we heard it all the commotion died down.&#x200B;

We are your guides, sent here to make sure that you do not lose your way now that you have lost your sight.Listen to us or you will be punished.&#x200B;

I felt something touch my shoulder and it hasnt left my side since.We were slaves with a master constantly looking over our shoulder.When I woke up on day 730, I thought it was going to be an ordinary day.I would wake up, do whatever task Id been assigned, eat my shitty food and go back to bed.I did not expect to see.I almost screamed out in joy until I saw what was written on my wall 

Don't Tell Them You Can See.&#x200B;

I froze and immediately closed my eyes.That was my first mistake, but at the time I did not know.Thoughts began racing through my mind, who shouldnt I tell?Why shouldnt I tell them?How did they know that I would one day regain my sight?Unbidden an old nursery rhyme came to mind

I keep six honest serving-men 

(They taught me all I knew); 

Their names are What and Why and When 

And How and Where and Who.At this point I lost it and burst out laughing.I didnt let out a belly laugh or a chuckle; I laughed like someone who had lost his mind.Theres something calming about laughing like that.Youll never understand it until you are standing on the edge of sanity.I laughed for god knows how long before they came for me.&#x200B;

Hey guys please tell me what you think.I'll be uploading part 2 soon
