"Well, ask Tom Starter.", the beautiful blonde with large baby blue eyes declared, pointing to India on the globe on my desk.Let's review, shall we?1.Aliens land on my lawn last night.2.They wake me up at 3:30 , are quite cordial and charming, and carry a mild sedative that they administer by flashing  a lavender colored light in my eye.They also have no mouths.I won't elaborate on their original appearance other than that because I dont want to puke again.3.Beautiful lady is the leader, and the one most enthusiastic about changing appearance for me.4.They were perplexed about my lack of understanding of what colors and light really are.5.They left in a hurry to Washington once

I don't have time to explain much else other than I found Tom meditating in an Ashram in Meshandisha, India in the Yedysh province, by his social media account.I was already a seasoned traveler so I went on my way back to the country I'd wandered around in as a youth.He said he'd had a dream I'd seek him and he'd been writing about the Ghoosa his whole life.Well, since he saw the Twilight Zone episode about them in 1962.I looked at him funny when he said that and made a mental note to look that up when I got back to the hostel.I didn't tell him about the aliens.Tom explains: the Ghoosa are "pain bodies" that people give up when they recover from illness.Mental illness creates the strongest ones.They continue existing after we heal as long as we acknowledge them by suffering.They communicate among themselves and feed on negative energy, and though they are not malicious, they need our suffering to survive.I sat, dumbfounded and asked about how to see them.And
