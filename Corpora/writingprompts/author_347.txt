I was mid-yawn when I realized that the cashier had stiffened as I asked for my coffee.His already vacant gaze glazed over even more, making me wonder if my simple request had been too much for the poor kid.He blinked slowly and looked at me."I'm sorry, what?"His speech was slurred, almost like his mouth was full.His vacant gaze just passed over me, like he was looking for something."Uh, yeah.Can I get a coffee?Two sugars."I was growing concerned.McDonald's isn't known for hiring the best, and I was certain I just broke one of their employees.I watched as the youth practically snapped to attention and moved with military stiffness to the cups, grabbing one and filling it with one watchful eye measuring the amount before coming back to the counter, setting it down firmly in front of me.He looked at the cup and then to me, expectantly."Thanks.Could I get a couple of sugars and a lid, please?"Dear God, this kid wasn't playing with a full set of marbles.He turned on heel and grabbed two sugars, counting them out like a bank teller counting money back to a customer, before tearing them open and pouring them into the cup.Everything was so robotic all of a sudden.He grabbed the lid and pressed it all around, sealing the cup before grabbing it with both hands and raising it to his lips.I watched in horror as he sipped my coffee before setting it down."What the hell, man?!"I was pissed."I'm testing for poison."His response was simple, and so utterly ridiculous that I wasn't sure I heard him right."Poison?!Dude, I just wanted a coffee.What are you trying to pull?"I was starting to attract some attention, but didn't really care."I'm sorry, my liege.I will make you another cup.""What?""I said I will make you another cup of coffee, sir."I shook my head."Don't worry about it.I'll go somewhere else."I've never seen someone look so horrified, dejected, and sorrowful so quickly.He began to tear up, his face wracked with emotion, even as his gaze remained vacant.I took a step back as he moved with precise steps from behind the counter, approaching me, falling to his knees and prostrating himself."Please, sir!Forgive me!Let me make you another cup!I beg of you," he cried."Dude!Get up!Jesus Christ.No, don't worry about it."I was backing up and looking for the door as he started to rise, tears streaking down his face.He hesitantly took a step toward me, one hand reaching out."Leave me alone!"I screamed.The dining room was deathly silent, people frozen in place watching a full grown man backing away from an acne riddled child."Of course, sir."He snapped back to attention and went back behind the counter, as though nothing had happened.Someone chuckled nervously.I looked around, suddenly embarrassed, my face flushed and my heart pounding as I turned and bolted for the door.I fumbled my car keys digging them from my pocket, cursing as I dropped them.I heard a small gasp and saw a mother covering her child's ears.Raising my hand in an apology, I scooped up my keys."Sorry, sorry.Rough start to the day.Have a good one."The reaction was instant.The mother's eyes glazed over.She nodded slowly, hands still clasped over her daughter's ears.The look on her face reminded me so forcibly of the cashier's that I involuntarily shuddered and looked back inside to see him talking with his manager, his tear-stained face wrapped in confusion.I looked back to the mother and then ran to my car.I've never had a problem talking with people.It's a knack, I suppose.A freak of nature.My brain thinks English, my tongue spits out English, and somewhere after the fact, there's a little twist in the air that delivers in some other language in their ears.Chinese, Arabic, Spanish, even Eskimo, it doesn't matter.I can speak any language without intention, full fluency and no trace of my heritage.I ended up starting to carry a police grade wire on myself to record my languages.Thus far, I'm up to 127 different languages, not including the specific dialects therein.It'd be better if it worked both ways; people get huffy when they start talking to me in rapid-fire Italian only for me to raise my hands in supplication and say, in perfect Italian, that I don't speak Italian.I shook off the rough start and headed to work.I found myself a job working in construction management, designing custom homes.Perfectly safe, not a lot of talking needed since all my work just went to another department, and I could just bury myself into drawings."Good morning, Mr.Robertson!"Ashley was always so chipper in the mornings.I nodded my greeting to her and smiled slightly, slipping back to my office.Firing up my computer, I sat down and sighed heavily."Mr.Robertson?"I looked up.Ashley was standing in the doorway, looking hesitantly around my office."Yeah, what's up, Ashley?""Is everything okay?Is there anything you need?""Yeah, just a rough start to the day.I would kill for a cup of coffee, really."Ashley snapped to attention, her vibrant blue eyes glazed over.I shuddered.She marched off military style.I could hear her heels clacking down the hallway.Almost as soon as she left, she returned, bearing a hot cup of coffee.She clutched it in both hands, looked me dead in the eyes with her vacant gaze, and raised the cup to her lips, sipping deeply before setting it down on my desk."What the FUCK, Ashley?!"I was incensed.She blinked slowly."I was testing for poison."I stopped short."What did you just say?""I was testing for poison, my liege."I blinked.Laughed a bit."Ashley, did someone put you up to this?am I being pranked right now?""Of course not, sir.I take your health very seriously."Something was wrong.The perkiness was gone from her voice.It was flat, as though she was just responding automatically."Ashley, you're starting to worry me.Knock it off, please."I pleaded.She turned, slowly, leaving the lipstick stained coffee cup on my desk and left my office, closing the door firmly behind her.I held my breath until I heard her heels clacking back towards her desk.I pushed the coffee aside and turned to my computer.There was only one thing I could do, a trick I learned with the advent of the Internet.It's not just when I talk that the conversion occurs; any medium I communicate in is translated.With online translators all over the place, I found that all I had to do was play back my speech from my recording, and learn what language I was speaking in.I plugged my recorder in and played back the last 15 minutes.Ashley's chipper hello, the shuffling in my office, her inquiry to my day and then, as I was used to hearing, nonsense.Some non-English language.I've gotten pretty used to figuring out the roots of some languages; roots in latin, non-latin, and so on.I didn't recognize this one.I fired up the speech to text translator and played my voice back.The translator sputtered and cycled, my computer's fan kicked up a few notches and I could imagine it chugging along as it worked through all the languages in its repertoire.I waited almost ten minutes for the program to chime it's findings.A single line.I didn't believe it.I stared blankly at the screen, trying to process what I was looking at when my phone rang, snapping me out of my blank stare.I snatched the receiver."Robertson, Holmes Custom Designs.How can I help you?""Yes.Hello, Mr. Robertson.I have been looking for you for a long time."The voice was musical, androgynous.Like a harp that was being played specifically to sound like words."Well, you found me," I chuckled."How can I help you?""It's how I can help you, actually.You've had an interesting start to the day, I imagine.I helped design the speech translator you're using.I designed it to specifically single out a significant language and notify me when there was a hit.You flagged it.""Uh..." I stammered."Don't worry, Mr. Robertson.I'm here to help you.A piece of advice though; don't ask anyone to do anything for you.You'll find that they'll be a lot more helpful than you expected."The musical notes continued on, picking up pace, almost as though they were excited."I'm coming down to your office.We have a lot to discuss, my friend.""Wait, I -" I was cut off, hearing the distinct chime of a ended call.I looked back to the screen glowing dimly, showing a single line of text."Mandate Parere"

"Obey my Command."
