The humvee rocked relentlessly as it tore through the rough terrain, almost throwing God out of the driver's seat.His vice-like grip on the steering wheel was the only thing keeping him in the vehicle.He yanked it back and forth in desperate attempts to avoid the incoming ordinance, eyes twitching to the rear view mirror for guidance.*Goddamnit,* he thought, catching glimpses of the rising dust cloud behind him, *the humans are closing faster than I expected.*

"Jesus Christ," shouted Jesus Christ, "do you see that?""It's about time they took us seriously," laughed Satan."What is it?"asked God through gritted teeth, swerving to avoid another explosion."A gunship, father," said Jesus, his voice sinking, "a very, very large one."God glanced into the mirror once more.An enormous flying fortress now dominated the sky behind them, gaining fast.Its metallic skin glinted in the dying sun, revealing an arsenal of weapons more fearsome than any he'd seen before.Evasive manoeuvres would be useless against a monster like that.He would have to do something drastic."Jesus, take the wheel," he said, turning to face his son."Father, no, your powers are nearly"

He put his hand on Jesus' shoulder to calm him, smiling softly, then looked to the back of the jeep."Satan, get behind me.""Heh, you got it boss," he grunted, hauling an assault rifle in both hands."Buddha... man the fifty cal."The bulging man only smiled in response.Then, with calm resolve, he shifted his weight behind the turret, grasped the trigger, and took aim at the encroaching hordes.A moment later, the sound of jolly laughter and blazing gunfire filled the air."Please don't do this, father," said Jesus, squeezing past God into the driver's seat, "we won't be able to survive without you.""I know you are afraid, my son, but technically speaking... well, you *are* me."Jesus' shoulders sagged."I could never be as great as you.""Nonsense.The mistakes I have made are countless, and creating these monsters is only one of them."He gestured out to the approaching armada."I don't want you to be as great as me.I want you to be *better*."And with that he leapt into the air, Satan at his side.The ground shrunk below him, revealing the extent of the human army.There were thousands of them, swarming like ants, devouring the land in their vicious pursuit.A pang of guilt struck him as he watched.Everything was his fault.He wasn't omniscient, he couldn't have known that it would end this way, but he should never have given them so much power.They were his greatest mistake... and he would pay for it with his life."You sure you wanna do this, boss?"Satan was hovering beside him, brown fur whipping wildly in the wind, rifles slung against his shoulders."We've had our turn, old friend."He smiled, familiar energy swelling up inside him."It's time to pass on the mantle."Satan grinned in return, madness flashing in his eyes.Then they turned their attention on the writhing mass of damned souls below them.Deities were not immortal, nor omnipotent.It had taken a long time for the humans to figure that out.Their technology and numbers were overwhelming now, and God wasn't sure if his kin would be able to survive the onslaught.But he did know one thing.He would give his son as much time as possible to gather his forces and fight.The humans would never forget this day.The day that heaven and hell rained their wrath upon them.
