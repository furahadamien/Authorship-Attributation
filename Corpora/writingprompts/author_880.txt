he first time the incident occurred I was in a busy mall.I bumped into the person in front of me and apologized, but I got no response.A moment later she fell forward.What a bitch!Not only did she ignore me, but she completely over-reacted with such a delayed response.She screamed, and a bunch of tough-looking guys approached me.Oh boy, I was in for a fight.I braced myself for the first punch, but his fist stopped mid-swing.Perplexed, I noticed that EVERYTHING had stopped in that moment.I quickly used my advantage to retaliate and back away.As time began to move again, he flew backwards from the impact.Seeing my "quick" movements, everyone backed away.I used this chance to flee.You would think that moving through stopped time would be cool, but I soon realized that I had no control over it.It would only last a few seconds each time, but that was enough for me to collide with someone.Worse yet was if I was driving.There was no way for me to set the pedal back to normal if I pressed too hard, so I could easily speed up if I wasn't paying attention.I soon made it my mission to find out who was doing this to me.My search finally led me to Egypt, where I saw it.A man with golden hair yelled out "Za Warudo!"and time stopped.Even though I had finally met my tormentor, I felt such an immense pressure emanating from this man.My own body froze, and probably for a good reason: the man casually stuck a knife through someone's neck."Time will begin to move again", he proudly proclaimed.And with that, he went on with his business as if nothing had happened.This man was extremely dangerous, but I couldn't let him notice me.I had to follow this man to stay out of his line of sight at all times.If he saw me move in stopped time, I was dead.In the time spent following him, I saw some truly bizarre shit.Eventually some foreigners confronted him, but there was nothing I could do.I couldn't risk my life for these people.Instead I had to watch in horror and hope they could figure it out on their own.Sadly, a few of them lost their lives in that process.First a high school student who could manifest this green webbing of some sort thought he had cornered him.But sadly he was no match for this man.I had to watch as he casually unwove the kid's web and then finish it up with a punch straight through his stomach.I had to resist the urge to puke.The next to fall was an old man who could create this weird purple vine.Apparently the golden-haired man couldn't physically touch him, so he precisely threw a knife at his throat.I braced myself for the murder that was going to unfold in front of my eyes in mere seconds.As I grieved for the death of the old man, his apparent grandson received the critical knowledge of that man's ability.There was hope, but what could this kid do?Fly was apparently the answer.Bizarre.I watched knowing that it was useless for him to keep fighting (or at least the man thought so).However there was a glimmer of hope!The kid moved in stopped time!It seems like the first twitch was a trick with a magnet, but the sucker-punch was no illusion.He killed the man!Or so I thought.I couldn't exactly comprehend it, but apparently he is immortal.FML.That didn't stop the kid from trying though.The following battle was too crazy to fully explain.The fight was so ridiculous that it ended with the two punching their way through a fucking road roller!wtf, where did that come from?But the kid did it, and my hell was over.That man was finally dead.I was free at last!Or so I thought, until it began to happen 10 years later.I'm done with this shit.

The key to a successful business is happy customers.It's simple really: make a good product and don't piss off your customers and they'll do the advertising for you.The best product in the world will fail if it has a bad image.That's where my job comes in.Nabisco hired me to make sure Oreos stayed the family-friendly cookie that they've been for the past few decades.It started pretty normally, but I wanted to make absolutely sure that nothing spoiled our good name.It started with maintaining our social media accounts.Simple advertising evolved into resolving bad customer experiences.Resolving bad experiences evolved into preventing them from happening in the first place.I looked into every employee's background and then some.Multiple employees were let go before the police received anonymous, credible reports of hard evidence detailing a wide variety of crimes.I made damn sure that "Oreo" and "Pedophile" were never in the same headline.Then we ran the promotion.Some contest where the winner would receive a package of Oreos every month for the rest of their life.Super easy to enter, and all recipient names were hidden.That way "Hitler" wouldn't be receiving our endorsement anytime soon.Quick media buzz for a month or so, then a lifetime of word-of-mouth for one "lucky" individual.Also thrown into the deal was the ability to request any flavor you want, and even try our new flavors before the public does.What the general public doesn't know is that I get to decide who wins, and I'll make it whoever will give us the most long-term advertising use.I picked a young politician.He was full of hope, optimism, and most importantly charisma.His background was squeaky clean and he didn't seem likely to be corrupted by power or money.But I could use him.Then 2020 hit and even I couldn't have predicted the massive Civil War that broke out.I don't know all the details, but the result was Nuclear warheads detonating within our border.Foreign powers were blamed and soon the entire world crumbled into chaos; minus one company that is.I made damn sure that I did my job.Our social media offered advice on how to stay safe in the post-apocalyptic world.Our factories were now shelters for the common folk.Our suppliers were unscathed by the war and now 100% dedicated to Nabisco.Most importantly, our products were still being consumed by the masses.But what of the young politician?He continued to receive his package of cookies and creme every month on the dot.Tracking him was difficult, but it was all worth it in the end.He credited Oreo for giving him hope in this wasteland of our country.He made horrible cookie puns in his speech to rebuild America.He hired our staff to run his campaign in the settlements across America's ruins.He even handed out Oreos to cancer-ridden children on the verge of death.He was the first president to be unanimously elected to office.But most importantly of all, my boss gave me a 5% pay raise with a free package of Oreos.
