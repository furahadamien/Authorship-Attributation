"So what you're saying is...I'm in hell?"She glanced around the plain white room she was standing in, then back to the used-car-salesman looking guy in front of her.He looked to be in mid-thirties and reminded her of a Kennedy, except for his yellow eyes and ugly tan suit."Where's the fire?""People always ask about the fire!Look, honey, your priorities need to be in order.Like hello!Devil here!"He waved and gestured to his cheap suit "And besides, Catholics made that up.I refuse to add fire just to cow to mortal expectations."His bitter tone gave the impression that this was an arguement he'd had with people before."...Okkkkay?"She crossed her arms over her chest and sighed when she realized she was still in her Wal-Mart Uniform.Crushed underfoot by the sweaty masses, she couldn't believe it.She picked at her nametag.Claire Haskill, deli clerk.Dead at 31 because of 50% off TV's."Why am -I- here?""Oh, lots of reasons.But the main one involves a girl named Sally Cushings, fourth grade.The toothpaste incident."A cruel smile twisted over Lucifer's unnaturally handsome face."So creative."She almost argued with him."Yeah, okay, that's fair.""Ha!And that's what I'm looking for.Creativity!Passion!"He gave a short wave of his hand and two chairs appeared in the middle of the room."Sit, sit."Claire hesitated only a moment before flopping into her conjured chair.Lucifer undid the buttons on his suit and smoothed it down as he settled into the seat across from her."So, Claire, I have an offer for you.No one ever takes me up on it but I guarantee that it's a -huge- upgrade from the usual package.""Can I leave?""Good God no!"He laughed "No no, but Hell has had a massive overcrowding problem ever since they installed slot machines in airports.My guys and I can't keep up, so I've been trying to outsource some of the torture and punishment.Humans are surprisingly squeamish."She stared at him for a weighty moment."You want me to torture people?""Excatly!I'd put you in charge of a small group, maybe 100 souls?You could do -whatever- you like to them."Clair felt a smile touch her face.Her first real, genuine smile since she had pulled on her tacky blue apron."....-Whatever- I want?"~.~.~.~.~

"E-excuse me?"Clair turned from stocking chocolate milk and arched a brow at the soccer-mom lady standing in front of her."I have this coupon," one trembling hand extended a worn, crumpled piece of red paper towards Clair."I won it in the...the cart corral race?I'd like to redeem it."Clair took the cupon and glanced at the front."Oh that's great!A get out of hell cupon, you must have beaten a -lot- of souls for this."Claire smiled warmly at the woman, who gave a shaken smile back."Let me see here."Claire turned it over--"Oh, I'm sorry, it looks like your coupon is expired.""What?!But I just got it!"Karen (Claire called all the women Karen and all the men 'Dave', it was just easier) sounded both pissed off -and- desperate."Let me speak to your manager!"Claire's lips turned up until the tips of her pointed teeth were visible, poking out over her lip.An evil laugh spilled from her mouth as Karen shrank down in fear.Her new demon voice was great for this, deep and echoing through the infinate asiles of Hell-Mart."I am the manager.'
