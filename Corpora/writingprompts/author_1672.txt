"I was what???"the demon screamed back at me."You were supposed to be chicken soup!"I cried back, at this point literally crying as well."How in the world did you manage to summon me while making chicken soup?"the demon asked."I don't know, I don't know.I'm the worst cook ever.I once set my place on fire while making cereal," I said."I tried making something out of this recipe book that my grandmother passed down, and now look what happened!"I sat down in a defeated slump.Surveying my surroundings, the place was all burned down.Everything in the kitchen was burned to a crisp, and the floor was on fire."Great, now I have to move again.And I just got here too!"I shouted."Hey, hey," the demon said, crouching down and putting his hand on my shoulder in a comforting gesture."Why are you so sad?I figure there must be something else to this.I mean seeing as how you aren't freaking out about summoning a demon into your kitchen, there is something seriously wrong with you.""It's just that I never do anything right," I said, looking up at the demon."Everything I do just goes up in flames.Literally.""Well here," the demon said, and then he snapped his fingers and the everything returned back to normal.No fires, the furniture was back, and there were no burn marks on anything.Eyes wide, I got up and my tears stopped."How did you -" 

"I'm a demon kid.I can practically do anything.""Then can you help me make chicken soup?""Sure, now let me see you try again."Hope filled my body with warmth as I felt the kindness of the demon.He was wiling to do so much for someone who just summoned him while trying to make chicken soup.I vowed to get it right this time, and follow the recipe to the tee."Okay," I said, grabbing the recipe book one more time."Now what's the first step," the demon asked, looking around the kitchen for the pots and pans."First, grab your summoning stick and then make a big star on the floor," I read out."Wait what?""Then take the blood of your enemies and draw a circle around the star.""Hold on -"

"Then repeat this enchantment 3 times: nez requiem das jorbas"

"GIVE ME THAT!!"the demon said, leaping towards me and grabbing it out of my hands."THIS IS NOT A RECIPE BOOK!"the demon shouted at me."What do you mean?Yes it is, my grandmother said so," I replied."And it even says so on the title page.'Recipe Book'.""'For Summoning Demons and Monsters - Advanced'" the demon replied."What?""RECIPE BOOK FOR SUMMONING DEMONS AND MONSTERS - ADVANCED!!!"the demon shouted back at me."This is a summoning book kid!!And here I was feeling all sorry for you.Did you bother reading the entire title?""Well not exactly ~" 

"Sigh, kid.Just never cook again.Or anything for that matter."the demon said.And then he disappeared.
