He walks in as if nothing's happened and sits at the head of the table.With a somewhat forced light-heartedness he calls to mom to hurry up with dinner.The collar on his shirt is frayed, Salt and pepper have finally made an appearance around his temples.The lines on his weather beaten face are that of a hard life.Mom is hurrying between the kitchen and dinner table.She keeps her head down and eyes on her task as He throws little jibs at her.I try to catch her eye.Mom... what do we do?Do we pretend nothing's happened.Do we keep going as if everything is fine?Do we confront and make a fuss.Demand answers?Which is the right way mom?Finally the table is set and mom sits in her usual place to the right of my dad.Only I'm left standing there.Unsure.Confused.Waiting.If he demands I sit, I'll tell him off.Confront him and even kick him out.If he does it in an apologetic way I might let it slide for now.If he's too timid though then I'll know he's here to mooch off us and won't allow it.A little thought in the back of head started whispering and I pushed it back.I won't think of that.It's not going to happen.It won't!*What if he doesn't acknowledges you?What will you do?What can you do?* 


I wait, and wait, and wait.
