A man of no origin sits amidst debris, his pallid face a guise of misery, his stare a forlorn song.The rubble that surrounds him is a reflection of the many ways he is broken, and into the dusty, fragmented mirror he whispers a soliloquy.What form must I take for her notice?So many ways I present myself, and so many ways she finds to reject my love.Why, on this earth have I been granted such a gif, to contort my very existence to suite ones pleasure, yet each rejection is more powerful by the light of thisembarrassment.How unappealing I must be, so perfect on the outside, yetdisfigured in some unknown way.his hand clenches at his lapel, the clenching of his heart a misery he cannot shapeshift, his tears a searing reminder that he is no immortal, he is no god.His fist slams heavily on the vanity, the remaining fragments of mirror that held to the warped wooden oval shatter and fall, the dust rises as he stands in a frenzy.II will no longer hide.That is the only answer, the only thing that makes sense.Maybe the power has corrupted me, maybemaybe by trying to give her what I am not, who I am not, is my true folly .No, this time, I will bear myself to her, and I will show her my real face, no faade for her amusement, no obnoxious chivalry, no mimicry.No, this time, with whatever remains of my pride I will be there for her as I am, not as I think I ought to bebut I can feel it, Im scared, nothing to hide behind, open to judgment, vulnerable.Will she take?Will this finally be it?Yes, I think so.It must be so.

In a single motion he tears the suit vest from his body, buttons clatter to the floor, fabric screaming as it is torn.He angrily pulls the belt from his waist and steps out from the pant legs.Inside his chest he feels a fluttering, the hairs of his neck kissed by an unseen breeze, and with a last tear rolling down his cheek, the bones of his body begin to shift.His transformation is never easy, and by a series of pops, creaks, and ligaments stretching, it is both an unsightly and painful ordeal, but for love, this is nothing.Those who have felt loneliness know that nothing hurts more than a broken heart.There he stood, now back as he was before the incident; a pudgy, socially awkward nerd with imperfect skin.He wasnt bad looking, by any means, but now, casting aside the fakery, mentally erasing the scripted quotes he memorized he took a shower, put on his plain, business casual dress, and headed out from the abandoned building he had been living out of.Will she smile, this time?Or will she greet me with disgust?I dont knowbut this time, it will be genuine.Oh God, please, let this be, let her see that I am gentle, let her see that I will care for her. He swallowed, his footsteps on the rain-drenched asphalt slow, and to the dark clouds of the just-past storm he nods.She will see this time, Im sure of it. He nods, and throwing the tarp from his covered car he sets off, to see her, and for her to finally, truly, see him.
