"I'm getting really fucking sick of this!"Mitch shouted at Juniper, working quickly to untie the ropes that held her hands behind her back."Yeah, well I wish you never had to show up either.But here we are again."Juniper kept an eye on the door to her interrogation room, waiting for the foreign agents to return.After gnawing on a particularly tight section of rope, Mitch spat."Can't you get a more relaxing job?Like in an office?I could just show up to help get the printer working or something like that.""Mitch, you know this has been my life's ambition.""But it isn't MINE.You've dragged me along for this whole ride, working your way towards the top of the heap.I think you LIKE that I was cursed."Juniper rolled her eyes, but said nothing.Her bonds fell to the ground.As she rubbed her wrists, Mitch crossed his arms and pouted."I'm going to get fired, ya know.I can't keep randomly disappearing with no notice.""So I'll get you a job in an office with my association.""I want nothing to do with you!"The handle of the steel door turned with a clunk.A grating squeal of rusty metal cut through their argument as Juniper's captors swung the door open.As they rushed in to fight, Juniper took them on alone with nothing but the chair, the rope, and her martial arts skills to aid her.Mitch shrieked and cowered in a corner.He never was much help in a fight.
