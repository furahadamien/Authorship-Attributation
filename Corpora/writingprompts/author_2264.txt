The Remains of a once Great world

This universe, is quite large, and ever expanding.And so, we always thought that from our earliest days on our dying world that someone will save us from overselves.Our drive for war, and blood had cost us precious time to evacute this poisoned world.But, we had saved our selves.And so after several thousands of years of toiling in the mud, the dirt, the blood.We finally dragged our battered selves off of our homeworld.Our great Mother that had given life to us, betrayed and left to die by its own children.We left our Birthplace to seek other places to escape to, to escape our guilt for what we had done.What we could have done to prevent it.For eons we drifted on our massive Ships.Our time was clocked, and we only had so long until we met the same untimely demise as those that we left on the surface.The first planet we found.Oh, it terrified us.It shook us to our core, what we saw, it was tragic.Saddening, terrifying.It was a reminder of what would have happened to us.We the Skorg have long seeked a planet to settle on.And so we did, but, this planet came with its own story to tell.A story of war, waste, arrogance and ignorance.We had salvaged their technology with the help from automated drones.It gave us insight into them.They called themselves humans.Which meant in one of their languages, wise man.Their technology was certainly advanced for their time, but still primitive in comparison , we were suprised that they hadn't left their planet however.After a decade of study, we had already gotten a detailed look at them.Their weapons.Aswell as their space programs, their need to reach for the stars.We could almost feel the love and curiosity, to reach for the stars exuding off of their ancient archives.An ancient need to reach for the stars, not unlike ours as we wanted to survive.Rather, they wanted to spread out, they saw the universe as beautiful, and vast.And they wanted to enjoy this beauty, see this beauty.They wanted to live because they love.We wanted to live because we fear.Months in orbit turned into years, years turned into decades.Our studies then showed something more frightening

Their most powerful weapon.It was a Nuclear explosive device.A nuclear bomb.It was then that we realized, this was the starting point, the beggining of the end for them.Their arrogance for their planet had already made irrlerable damage to their atmosphere.We found heavy traces of unstable compounds in their soil, as well as traces in the atmosphere.A great war was once waged.We can only guess what happened after.War soon broke out between several factions, and soon they started using their weapon in mass.They were doomed, destroyed by their thirst for war.It out weighed their love for the stars, and now what had become of them?They have become fragmented, their world abandoned.Most of their knowledge lost to time.The remains of a once great world.A civilization that may have accidentally discovered us, and saved us from ourselves.Destroyed by their passion for war.-
