All I wanted was some sleep.My phone is lighting up with notifications saying to look at the moon.But the official "All Holy" notification that only shows up if something terrible happens, like a nuclear bomb.And guess what I did.Woop dee doo I looked at the moon.Like an idiot I looked out I saw the moon.And at first nothing happened.But then I see the moon is bigger than usual.Then a sound penitrated my ears.It doesn't hurt, but it fills me with fear.I start crying.Then I saw the face.The horrid face of the moon.It smiled at me.It stared at me with such a deadly stare.Then the deathly hum turned into voices.It told me in multiple languages to "Get out", and "Sleep tight".The moon turned red and I saw the people in the streets, running, shouting.When I looked back at the moon I swear it winked at me.It's mouth opened at I was about to yell out in terror but before I could I felt a searing warmth enter my veins and I fainted.So this is the first time I wrote in a while and in my opinion it is not good because of the paragraphs.
