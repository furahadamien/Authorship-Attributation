Time #247 happens while you're walking in a busy park.You notice they used to be increasing in length, but ever since #240 5 seconds has seemed to be the max.Suddenly you hear a voice behind you, "you.. you can move when I do that?"You panic, a natural response, and your body freezes up.Surprisingly, everyone else's does too.All except the figure behind you, who walks in front of you, completely bewildered.As time unfreezes, so do you, and you look at this person with obvious questions."I've always wondered why I couldn't move while freezing time.Always seemed like the most useless power, and yet, I kept at it anyway, now I see why.It appears that not only can you move while I freeze time, but I can move while you freeze it....

We should team up."
