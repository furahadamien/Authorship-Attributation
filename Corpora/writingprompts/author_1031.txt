I cant recall the last time I used toilet paper, youd think seeing the piles and piles of toilet paper in a wallmart youd be able to sustain humanity, or whats left of it, for quite some time.Even though its been 30 years since functioning water I still try and flush the toilet, Im wondering why I even keep using these things.I guess it helps me stay sane.When I attempt to leave the bathroom, the door wont budge, like somethings blocking it.I try to push harder, it still wont move.Not a lot of exciting things happen nowadays, this was going to be my highlight of the week.I imagine myself going commando on this door, I brace myself, left shoulder pointing forward and bolt to the door.The moment my shoulder hits the door and my weight accompanies me, the door flies open with me going headfirst in whatever the hell was blocking the door.I black out.&#x200B;

Im having this weird dream, or at least I think I am.Im young again, before it all happened.I come down the stairs and see my mom in the kitchen baking and then the smell that smell.This is not a dream, this is a nightmare!?My mom slowly turns around holding a cake and says Hey hon, I baked your favorittee, cheesecake with ore.I wake up, OREOOOOOOSSS NOOOOOOO I scream.&#x200B;

These fucking things ARGGHH!! I shout, it happened again.The boxes I landed in were filled with fucking oreos.The whole world has gone to hell, theres not a single living being out there but here I am, laying in a freshly made batch of oreos.If I didnt know any better I would say I am IN hell
