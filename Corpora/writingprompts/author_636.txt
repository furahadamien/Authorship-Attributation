"Dang it John stop day dreaming and help me!"Adam wheezes through clenched theeth.ak as I pickup trusted Betsy.She's been with me for years now, trusted old shotgun.Load a fresh shell and hobble towards the windows.Of course bars make it hard to see, but you can still shoot out of them."Hey John remember when it was just a simple day in the retirement home?"Adam says while walking towards my room loading his faithful bolt action."I don't remember too much these days, with how many years we ran out of meds.I do remember you still owe me ten bucks."I tease back."You keep switching it, you owe me twenty bucks and a pack of cigs darn it!"Adam starts peppering the hoard outside.The magic shot, the immortality shot, forever young shot.All these words are now curses.We all sort of remember when it came out.Nearly all of us old timers can sort of think of the past.The magic drug that allows one to never get old, boy how wrong and right that was.They never told you the side effects of course.Those blasted scientists only saw the green paper it made.Of course the oh so minor problem was ignored.It was a such a great promise for those who could take it.Immortality, to never age.As well as a huge side bonus of extreme regeneration.No one ever wanted to know the cost of course.What seemed like a minor glitch which everyone laughed off snow balled to ugly proportions.For immortality and nearly never being able to die, other then mass damage to the brain of course, you would just have a slight case of needing more meat.Just a little of course.That's how it always started, that slippery slope.Always that slight nudge in the wrong direction costs oh so dearly.The side effects?You hunger, more and more for meat.They said it was just that the body needed more protein to balance out the after effects.Yea effects that kept getting higher and higher while no one noticed.It of course started small, two hamburgers when before you could barley eat one.Five hamburgers became the norm for a sit down.Prices of meat started to rise, started?It sky rocketed to huge numbers.When a 10 year old would devour his weight in meat, there was a problem.Then the question, what happened when meat got scares?Now the real effects showed.The hunger it seems was larger and larger until all rationality was driven clear of the poor person.At first all the animals were targeted... but after they ate all those they started looking for mature meat.Human meat.Old people meat.Who would guess that retirement homes would become bunkers.Once we pulled all the children we could in we hunkered down.People hoped that if they couldn't get enough meat they would just burn themselves out.Such an empty hope.We call them skinnies now.Easy to spot of course, having no hair and gaunt looks.You might mistake them for just a starving person.That would be the last mistake someone made.They seem small and weak, but they have some crazy strength, and they don't relent.Everyone always asks, where is the government for this.They had been the first to go.As they got the shots two  years earlier then the public.The irony the first to go looked the sharpest cloths.Part 2

It didn't help that those in power used that power to hoard up all the meat which was left.The other larger problem was that all the egg heads and doctors had been on the second wave, the young ones of course.The older ones ended up all retiring and then kicking the bucket.Leaving the check to us "younger" oldies.They of course as well figured out what was going on ahead of time.In hind sight the wars we had where just a prelude to the real war.The war to live.Us olddies didn't get much warning, but at the very least because the government pushed us to the side it might have saved us.Far enough away from the cities but close enough for a bit of food.When the walls fell the cities got hit the hardest.I can't even remember how touch in go things got back then.It took some time to figure things out.Trying to get a hold of what was going on and how to get around them.Laud noises was always the best, but it also caused more to come.Cell phones had been a great boon leave one somewhere and call it they would rush over to that location, but those stopped working when no one was around to run things.Power?Yea that was still somewhat here or there, but power generators made a load of noise which again pulled the skinnies to the location.It wasn't normally worth the risk, but sometimes you would still need to get info out, and lucky for us ham radios still worked.Who would have thought classic tech would come back in style?The problem of course was food, with no animals around meat was far harder to come by."Dang it John stop day dreaming and help me!"Adam wheezes through clenched teeth."Oh sorry started to day dream there for a bit, next cig is on me."I hurry as my old bones creek to push the table over the window with Adam.The sound of fighting can be heard all over the old bunk.It seems the search party prodded a nasty bee's nest."It's going to be worth it, they found a truck with half a pallet of cat food.It might even be still good.I was just coming back from getting the kids into the safe room when the skinnies got spotted."Adam huffs as we finish fixing the window with the make shift table.Normally we wouldn't block the window, but this one's bars got bent from a mean tall skinnie.He's still smacking his lips at us, not worth the shells now that he's stuck.I use to hate the cafeteria, they always gave us bland food there.Now it's the safest place as the kitchen is made out of concrete."John let's go we need to find out what's happening in the west side, there might be a breach."Adam hobbles off yelling back at me.I miss the good old days of just sitting and sleeping, at least then you didn't have to worry about some person coming up and nibbling parts off you.We are at least lucky, some other old homes didn't have any vets around and just folded over after the breakout.I suppose it could be worse, we had a school trip visiting us oldies when the walls fell.Otherwise these young kids would have been and a dire straight.I shudder thinking about it.
