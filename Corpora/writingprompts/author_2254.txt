there was once a fairy tale so old and ancient that none of the worlds even knew where it came from."there was once an ancient empire who learned everything there was to not only know, but understand.they had reached across the stars, and had solved all their problems.when the dust settled and they had been everywhere there was to be they realized they where alone and fell into despair.their very reason for exploring the stars was wanting to meet others.and so they died off.their cities fell to the planets below and they destroyed the traces of them being there in hopes that one day someone might rise again, and would have room to expand like they did."its etched into every mind of the Glorphin people, taught to them from birth.they thought it was a just a tale, that like many others it was to teach of a moral or lesson.the Glorphins where, as far as anyone knew, the most ancient race out there.but when they came to a planet by chance, almost accidentally passing it, they found something that their wildest dreams could not compare.a massive monument, the size of a mountain and could be seen even from orbit.upon landing it told a story.the complete history of the people, with every surface covered in writing.it was made of an unknown material that they could not break or cut and was traced back to far far beyond that of even the first small Glorphin civilization on their planet.on the bottom of the monument, there was a small slot made.with a latch inside.when pulled it revealed a small computer chip and next to it was instructions on how to read what was on it.although the Glorphins where not intersted in that.they where interested in the massive machines that preserved the environment around the planet, so that the life on it would live.like what was discovered on their planet that had saved their early people from being wiped out by an asteroid with a massive laser.same architecture, and same tech was used.it was sadly not until many many decades later until they found the last inscription on the colossal obelisk.written in the same language as the rest of the writing and in their ancient dialect that was found in the ruins of their ancestors on their planet."I, Rem, am the last of my people alive.I like those who built this time capsule was human, and in the process of coming back to earth I stopped at a small planet to refuel and was brought to tears to find it had intelligent life on it, though it had not grown out of its native valley and had not even learned how to use fire yet.I stayed for a time to learn about them and even learned their language.I set up a sentry devise on the planet to keep them safe until they could take care of themselves and left.and so with my final effort, I write here.as my people a generation before me made this monument, I too write on it.I hope those people I found can live to see this.this is humanities last farewell.and so farewell, and godspeed star men."this planet was immediately absorbed into the empire and became the most treasured star system in said empire.even being held as more important as even their hope system, the Sol system as the inhabitants once called it, became the motivation to stop their war efforts and start to learn about their universe like these people once did.
