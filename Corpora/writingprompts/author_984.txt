*It's not about the money.It's about the principle of the thing!* 

I don't want you to get the wrong picture of me.I'm not some white-collar slob browsing through memes in an air-conditioned office.I'm an electrical engineer who put himself through school on nickels and dimes.I had to sell my radio to buy my uniform for my first day of work, although I would have sold a kidney if that hadn't covered it.If I'm willing to get my hands dirty to earn my money, you can sure as hell know I'm willing to get them dirty to get it back.When someone takes money from me, it's not just me they're stealing from.They're stealing from my father who worked a night job to keep clothes on my back.They're stealing from my children who can't understand why their father doesn't love them enough to get them the same toy their friends have.They're stealing from every honest man, every American dream, every - 

"Next in line please."The vein in my forehead learned to tap-dance.If a glare could kill, the McDonalds Cashier in front of me would have flipped his last burger."I gave you a twenty.You gave me change for a 10."My voice could have chiseled rock.There was a collective sigh from the line behind me, but I held my ground."I'm not leaving until you give me my 10 back.""I know how to do my job, *sir*.Next in line!"It would have been one thing if I was a strung-out fool scratching at my ass, but I was a professional man.From my tucked in dress shirt to my carefully parted hair, everything about me screamed credibility.The nerve of this greasy teenager to disregard me so quickly - 

But this wasn't over.Oh no, this was far from over.He was nothing compared to me, and I was going to prove it.But I wasn't going to stoop to his level.I was going to use my game to beat him.I'll admit, my plan seemed a lot simpler in my head.These types of registers just spring open when the electricity shorts out.After that, all I had to do was grab it and run.It wasn't stealing: it was justice.But then I guess I started overthinking things...The supplies I needed from Home Depot set me back a bit, but soon I'd put together a simple device which drew so much power in a feedback loop that the whole building would be overloaded.Sure I had to bribe the guy who worked there when he got suspicious what I was going to use it for, but you never know when I'll need to use this baby again.Of course, just to be safe I might as well get rid of the security cameras.No point going to all this trouble just to get caught.I can't believe it cost a couple hundred dollars just to get someone from the company to recall them for maintenance.Worth it, of course, because now I was ready to exact my revenge.Only he'd already finished his shift by then, and I didn't want to get someone else in trouble.I followed him home instead, maybe a bit too fast, because I got a speeding ticket along the way.He wouldn't have a register at home, but I could still go in and take it by force.Of course, for that I'd be safer to bring along some protection, so I had to buy a gun.Couldn't wait the three days, so I just got a hot one from a buddy I know.Cost a little extra, but you know what you can't afford to replace?Dignity.Finally, it was midnight, and I had everything I needed.Time to make this bastard pay.Or it would have been, if I hadn't accidentally broken into the wrong house.There was a lot of screaming and confusion.Understandable, given me crashing in through their kitchen window, but who the hell really needs a stain glass window in their house anyway?Bunch of white-collar pussies if you ask me.Of course I offered to pay for the damages, so it's not like any real harm was done.But now!The right house.Right time.Just before the break of dawn, I knocked on his door.Long, loud knocks.Not the sound of a thief in the night - more like the authoritative confidence of the police upholding the great law.No reply.What would the police do in this circumstance?Exactly the same thing I did.Break the door in.Gun at the level, I flipped on every light I came across.I have nothing to hide.Do you?"What's that awful racket?"An older woman.Must be his mother.She waddled blearily down the hallway in her nightgown, freezing when she saw the gun in my hand."Oh sweet Jesus.Michael!Call the police!""I am the police!"I roared."Where is that son-of-a-bitch?""You're no police.Where's your badge?""Well, not exactly the police.But I'm on the side of justice -" 

"Michael get down here and help me!"she screamed."Yeah, come here Michael," I added, albeit a bit less confidently than when I had begun."And bring my ten dollars!"Soon they were both against the wall, quivering in fear.I was starting to get uneasy now, but any hesitation would make it look like I was confessing to doing the wrong thing.I wasn't!The money was mine!And God as my witness, I wasn't leaving without it.The moment when he handed me the folded bill, I knew it was all worthwhile.Sure I'd spent my whole savings to get this back, but I'd also deterred this scumbag from his future life of crime.I put the bill in my pocket and walked home in triumph, the exalted return of a victorious emperor from his conquered land.I guess in retrospect I should have looked at the bill Michael gave me.Bitch only gave me a 5.---
