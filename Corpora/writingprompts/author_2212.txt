I couldn't believe my eyes..Hell...I couldn't believe ANY part of me...I fully admit I've been a bit of a deadbeat..I tried to be a good Dad but my business sense is as good as.my food choices...yeah not the best.It was my older kids that gave me the idea, it was a way of showing them that they still count when the baby was born.We kind of let it escalate, it was.never a cruel plan really.....it just ...happened.I expected her to realise, I really did.In fact I thought she was probably playing along to keep ME happy...her Mother is amazing...very spiritual, I guess.that encouraged her belief that another life is.possible, reachable...So yeah...I have to believe it, I mean I saw.it happen..
Crap!I deal with the bitterness of her siblings, wondering now if THEY had believed, been encouraged like my little girl, if THEY would have had magical experiences, a 100,% life change, if I had put the effort in for them like I did for my little sparkly eyed...Sorry, I'm back...it catches me you know?Im not sure if or when I'll see her, I mean to watch your child...vanish..just...disappear into a World of...well her idea of magic would be dancing at balls, foreign travel, animals, and being able to help people I guess...mine would be fried chicken and a cold beer...she's better than me.She's DONE better than me..Her Mum is the strong one you  see, the inner strength that shows in dignity and pride, im not like that.Do I regret raising her to believe in magic?Only for myself, in a selfish way....for my other kids who don't believe and are.lost,twisted and jealous.But to see my beautiful girl, my darling girl disappear into a new World.?A world of magic, of flying,of casting a spell over people,  of balls and dresses, a World where she can bring change, spread happiness and BE happy...
How can any Father regret that?,My only regret is missing her meeting the one and only Harry..now THAT would have been amazing, to have met him, to have presented my beautiful girl to HARRY....sigh..
Maybe ill meet him one day....after the honeymoon perhaps...Fly well my beautiful Meghan, enjoy your magical new life.
