Brad 6:9- And so it was that Chad and I, having consumed libations and unclean meats, awoke in the chamber of Mary Magdalene.I awoke first- from the glory of god shining down into the dirty room.The light bouncing off of empty bottles and onto not only my face, but also Mary's glistening snatch.Note that this was before me and my bro had met the holiest of all bro's, the son of party: Sleazus Christ.I tried to wake Chad for a sneaky escape, but in his drunken stupor he thought my shaking of him was someone attempting to draw graven images on his face, and so awoke loudly and violently, and with great swearing at your bro.In my own stupor his flashing of fists aroused my own anger, and so it came to pass that there was a great catching of hands by both parties; stirring our sultry host.Her babeliness giggled at our anger, and called to us for a truce and a return to a bonding of flesh.So here it was that the son of God came to see his on the low girlfriend for a romantic morning together, only to discover her with two dicks in her mouth, shouting a muffled "hey baby!", her teeth irritating the flesh of your dearest bro.Jesus sighed, removing his tunic "Alright bro's hurry up in there, it must be my turn soon."Too which chad replied, "Yo dog theres plenty of room in the back" so it came to pass that the holy foursome was consecrated with leftover wine and non-homoerotic touching of balls.When all were satisfied, His Broliness, pulled a joint from Mary's hair, saying "This is my grass, lay with it, and feel the glory of god shine upon you."Thus the Big Sleazy pulled a joint from Mary's hair for each of us and we lay in the sun.After an hour, none of our joints needed ashing, none of us were hungover, and all of us were right on the cusp of being too high, and yet were still functioning.It was in this moment that Chad and i decided we would dedicate all of our parties to this man, the chillest bro to ever chill."We wanna party with you for eternity bro!"I exclaimed, chad followed " Yeah man; aint no party like a JC party cause a JC party don't stop!"There following a slapping of hands and a shredding of air guitars.Big Sleazy, thusly being satisfied by our performance, and sheer display of overall broliness brought us into the crew, where me and chad would one day share in sainthood as the holy bros of party.
