Everyone always asks me what it felt like to lose my arm.Everyone always asks me what it feels like to no longer have it.One answer I'd always wanted to give but never had the courage to, was that it felt mostly like hopelessness.I had been a pianist, I'd lived and judged my life based on my ability to make people feel with music.I was crippled.I could no longer play my favorite pieces.I could no longer practice new ones.Losing the arm was essentially me losing my life.It's difficult to describe exactly how it feels to have an itch on an arm that isn't there.Imagine the feeling of sitting in a hairdresser's chair and having that annoying little itch crop up on your nose.Now imagine, that your arms are bound to your sides and there's nothing you can do to eliminate that annoying, burning, itch.It's not a terribly nice feeling.I learned that you can scratch your missing limb by using a mirror.You stand in front of the mirror and scratch your opposite arm while you look into your reflection.Remarkably, this works to eliminate the itch.I learned something else while doing just this very thing a few weeks ago.I was standing in front of the mirror, awkwardly scratching my elbow on the corner of my bathroom door, when I saw something in the mirror.A girl with eyes the color of charcoal, teeth yellow as rotten lemons, and blood seeping down her pale, pallid complexion.Before I knew exactly what I was doing, I lashed out with my missing arm.It felt like I did anyway.Something incredible happened, I felt my missing fist smash into the face of the incorporeal entity.I felt her teeth come loose, pain explode in my 'hand' and a ghostly tooth lodge into my fist.I'm not exactly sure who was more surprised, her, or me.Lights began to flicker in the room and objects around my sink began to hover menacingly.My electric toothbrush launched towards my head and I was narrowly able to dodge out of the way.It firmly embedded itself in the wall behind me.Using the mirror as a reference, I leaped on the ghastly girl and smashed my non-existent fist into her face until she stopped squirming.She faded away shortly afterwards.She never bothered me again.I'm not sure exactly where the spirits go after I beat them to a pulp, but I have purpose again.Besides, the pay for someone capable of genuinely dispatching a ghost is fantastic.Honestly, I think people mostly pay for the spectacle of a one armed man fighting an invisible ghost.Now when people ask me what it feels like to be missing an arm, I reply confidently.Sometimes it feels like I never lost it at all.*****************************************

Icy wind swept over a compound of log cabins.Small, twisted figures lurked outside each door.They chittered and barked in a harsh broken tongue.Inside one of the cabins sat an old man bent over a workbench.He was expansive, well over six feet tall, with a bone-white beard which reached the middle of his broad chest.He toiled away, stitching the leather of a harness.He savored the quiet time.The parts of the year where the twisted elves only beat and starved him.But every day which flew from the calendar, inching him closer to the hated holiday  was like a nail being driven into his skull.Soon he knew, he would be forced into the sleigh, and made to work until his bones quaked, until his body screamed for reprieve.Until he would rather die than take one more interminable step.He also knew from experience that by that time, he would be roughly a third of the way done.Tomorrow was it.Tomorrow was the day that the elves would load him onto the sleigh and force him to deliver their twisted gifts to all the boys and girls of the world.It would be over in a day.It would last him a lifetime.Time was different on the sleigh.He envied people blessed enough to burn in the fires of Hell.He longed for the burden of Atlas or Prometheus.His torture was more refined and cruel than ever they could imagine.He looked at the sleigh, tears streaming down his face.It was the night before Christmas, and all through the house, none heard his sobbing.Not even a mouse._______________________________________________________

I felt at my chest, feeling the ceremonial knife slipping between my ribs, piercing my heart.For a moment I could feel my heart pumping blood even with the knife lodged firmly within it.A warm sensation spread from my wound throughout my body."I dedicate my life to Satan, may my eternal soul serve him forever more in the unholy pits of the Hells."Thoughts of fire and brimstone warmed my mind as I slipped away into death...I blinked open my eyes, I was standing somewhere pleasantly warm and smelled slightly of fireworks.I was so taken by shock that for a long moment I failed to really absorb my surroundings.I was standing in front of a wrought iron gate, it was somewhat unimpressive, standing only chest high.Above the gate hung the words: 'Abandon a bit of hope but not too much hope ye who enter here.'I frowned, if I was where I thought I was, something didn't add up.In a bit of a daze, I pushed open the gate and walked along the cobbled road leading to 'The River Styx'.At least that seemed to be consistent with what I had learned.To my chagrin, I walked up to the titular river.The water was crystal clear for one thing, and it was barely larger than fifteen feet across, moreover, it looked to be no more than six feet deep at its deepest.On the river sat a slightly bobbing paddle boat with a young woman at the main seat."So, are you Charon?"I hedged.She replied in a cheerful high pitched voice, "Nope, that would be my brother.He works in a different place," she giggled, "My name is Sharon."I sat down in the seat beside her, "Wait, what 'other' place is this then?""Oh, this is Heck.Essentially it's for folks who didn't quite rate Hell, and didn't manage to squeeze into purgatory.""Oh ship," I paused, going over what I had said, "Wait, did I say ship?I wanted to say ship."She giggled in a trill of infuriating humor, "Oh, we're not allowed to swear here.This is Heck after all silly.""Son of a witch," I tried to swear.She laughed again, I swore to kill the witch if she laughed....What did I just think?I would stab the punt....Shuck?Pass?Swat?I pulled at my hair, now firmly in the grips of an existential crisis."Let me get this straight, I can't even *think* bad words here?"She giggled that infuriating giggle again, I longed to strangle her, but I couldn't seem to move my arm to actually do the deed."Of course not silly!This is Heck!You should have gone to Hell if you wanted to swear."I placed my head in my lap, clutching my head.I heard music on the air, I whipped my head up and asked, "What is that sound?I think I recognize that song."She nodded vigorously, "That's Mr. Roboto, by Styx.We named the river after them, the boss is a big fan."I shook my head, "At least your boss has a decent taste in music," I realized that we should have been across the pitiful excuse for a river ages ago and paid attention to our progress.We were making large, lazy circles in the river, going nowhere.I looked at Sharon, staring death at her, "Why the shuck are we going in circles?"She giggled, "You're not paddling silly!I would have told you, but you seemed to be enjoying the chance to talk!"I wringed my hands, and tried to stop imagining my hands around her neck.Grumbling, I began to paddle, the boat evened out its course and swiftly made it to the other side of the river.As I stood to exit the boat, Sharon waved and said, "Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto," in perfect time with the song.I tried to flip her off, but managed only to give her a friendly wave.I nearly screamed in impotent fury.I needed to get the heck out of here.I walked along the friendly looking path, following signs for 'Circle of the Danged'.I came to the gateway which seemed to be made from old minivan parts and suit ties.A woman in a paisley dress walked out to greet me, her hair in curlers and a shoe held threateningly in her right hand."What the heck is this?"I winced at the censored word.Why was hell censored?I've been able to think and say it the entire time....Ah, because before I was just using it as a place, not a swear.I suppose this place obeys pre-teen edgy logic on swearing.I was surprised to receive a swat on my rump from the haggard looking woman."What the shuck lady?"I was answered by another swat on my tuchus."Don't you try and use that kind of language around me young man!I'll paddle your behind!"she said sternly, waving the shoe menacingly in front of her."Sorry ma'am," I surprised myself by saying.She looked slightly mollified, "Now go clean your room mister.It's atrocious in there.""Wait, what level of Heck is this?"I asked, confused."This is talking back to your parents, now don't make me tell you twice.""I know," I muttered, "I'll go clean my room."I found myself in my old seven year old self's bedroom, and looking around at the room from a significantly reduced height."Ship," I said, my voice two octaves higher than I was used to.________________________I'm going to make this a mini-series.Probably in eight or nine parts, I'll have a part 2 up soon.Look up what Proverbs 30:17 has to say about this particular sin.;)

"..And so, if you refuse to torture your fellow man, you will be doomed to suffer for all eternity!"the red-skinned Devil whirled his trident and cackled madly."Okay, yeah, no problem.Do I get a pitchfork or what?"The Devil stopped whirling his trident, his mad laughter dropping to more of a slightly crazed giggle."Okay, uhhh...what?"The red-skinned fiend looked puzzled, pulling out a small black notebook which was decorated with tiny cartoon pitchforks, "I've got you here on multiple counts of petty theft, lying, threats of harm against others...nothing I see here suggests you'd be on the level of a Hitler or Stalin.What's your deal?""Sir, I worked retail for *fifteen* fucking years.I was killed in a stampede of shoppers."The Devil took a step back, "Ah," he replied, as if it all made sense now."Listen, I don't really think you belong down here getting tortured.After fifteen years as a wage slave, I'm actually impressed you didn't kill anyone," he dropped his voice and slid closer to the damned soul as if sharing a secret, *" Most veterans of retail do, you knowtheir managers never know what hits them."*

 "Trust me, I thought about it.Seriously though, when do I start?"The Devil handed his pitchfork out for the soul to take, "Shit man, you can start right away."He pointed down a long and darkened hallway, "Walk straight down that hall until you see the three-headed dog, take the first left and proceed through the fires of everlasting woe, and straight through the P.E.T.A.meeting-"

The damned soul interjected, "Wait, P.E.T.A.is actually evil, not just incompetent?"The Devil smiled broadly, "They kill more defenseless animals per year than any other organization.Face it, blood sacrifices are hard to come by, these guys fill the niche in the market.Anyway, once you get down the last flight of stairs, you'll be in the department of bad managers.I'm going to make you head of the torture division there."The damned soul smiled broadly, "I'll get right to work, Sir."As he walked off, the Devil shivered."Remind me to never get on the bad side of those retail workers.They give me the fucking creeps."_______________________________

It was a beautiful summer afternoon.Birds were chirping kids were playing in the streets, there wasn't a cloud in sight.There was one thing which rather spoiled this picturesque day.A massive spherical shape blocked out the sun for most of the central United States.Scientists didn't know what to make of it, the military wanted to nuke it, and several of the world's major religions decided that it was a sign from God.Most agreed that this was a sign of the apocalypse.For the first time in history, they were absolutely right."People of Earth, may we have your attention please.", a droning voice said, "This is Bellagor, Prime Prefect of this Sector.I am here to inform you that you are all in violation of several intergalactic treaties regarding population growth."His voice was being broadcast through every working system with a speaker, this did nothing but exacerbate his terribly grating voice."I am here in order to deliver two options.First, we can set limits on reproduction, only allowing one half of breeding pairs to have children this generation....", an uproar broke out from just about everywhere on Earth.The Prefect barely needed a recording device to hear their response.Even from low orbit.The Prefect sounded agitated, "Okay, okay.We can take the second option.Please yourselves.Prepare to glass  the entire planet.", through the speakers, Earthicans everywhere could hear him walking away and muttering, "The ungrateful little sloggars, not my fault they breed like rodents."People everywhere decided that this was the time.This was the perfect opportunity.They would finally get those televisions and digital watches they had always very much wanted, but could never afford.Some of them even had the chance to turn them on before the glassing began.They spent their final half hour on Earth watching that last episode of Stranger Things on Netflix, or if they weren't lucky, driving home so they could make use of their new flatscreen.*****************
