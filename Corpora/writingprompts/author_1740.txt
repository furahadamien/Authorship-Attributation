I stood in a room, well more like floated in one.I felt like I was underwater, the room was dark, darker than the night.It had no stars, no light, no nothing, just me and my sins.All of a sudden I heard a voice in my head It is time for you to be judged, my child The deep voice spoke, echoing in my otherwise empty mind The first judge was the person you were most cruel to It spoke.A teenager appeared J-Jeremy? I choked out, looking at him.Jeremy had a blueish tint to his skin Hello He spoke.Tears started to stream down on my face as I managed to choke out a few apologies.Jeremy was a young boy I bullied when I was young and dumb, he committed suicide because of the bullies, it was all my fault.Jeremy disappeared and the voice spoke The person you were kindest to in your life

A dog appeared in front of me, it was my dog that died a few days before I did, he had to be put down.I smiled at my dog with tears in my eyes and ran towards him, hugging him I missed you, my boy I whimpered as my dog wagged his tail, sadly he soon disappeared.The person who was saved by your choices It spoke.I never saved anyone I thought with a puzzled expression, how odd.A woman appeared in front of me, I gasped as I recognized her M-Melissa? I mumbled, tears falling once more as I gazed at her perfect face, her auburn hair, Green eyes and freckle face.Melissa, oh Melissa I once hugged her when she was feeling down, she died in a car accident 2 years ago.I guess I saved her with a hug.And the last judge, the person who was killed by you The voice spoke

I cried as a man took shape in front of me, it was my husband.I had smacked him over the head with a bottle of wine when we were both drunk and he was threatening to kill me.I had angered him that night, I regretted that deeply, it was the one thing that kept me awake at night, the thing that made me nervous someone would find out.I had passed it off, I said that he fallen and hit his head, it was a lie, he knew and I knew I-Im So Sorry..I never wanted to be a murderer! I choked out, curling into the fetal position.I felt a hand on my shoulder and saw my husband I forgive you, come with me My husband said, holding out his hand.I grabbed his hand and then I woke up.Edit: Grammar
