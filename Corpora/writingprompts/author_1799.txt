Cmere, Miss.

My tail wags reflexively, but I dont move.I lay with my head in my humans lap, her long-toed paw curled like a bird foot in the warm spot under my ear.My humans pups pup pats me on the side, and I shift a little so she can get to my belly.I wag my tail once, twice, in great lazy thumps.Cmere, she repeats, baring her teeth and then reaching to tug at my collar.I whine, and she stops.Her teeth disappear.She makes more sounds, but I dont listen; shes not going to say anything I understand, anyway, other than my name and dont.

My humans paw tightens and she coughs, loudly, with the rasp of fresh-clipped nails on hard gray ground.I whine again and nose her side.I wag my tail for her, but she doesnt seem to see.Her eyes have taken the milky white my mothers eyes did before she was taken away.Her short fur, what little she has, is almost colorless.Pup-pup sighs and she stands up on legs I remember my mom saying she used to knock out from under her when she was actually puppy size.She isnt anymore, and hasnt been for as long as Ive been alive.I nudge my human again, and Pup-pup reaches to take my collar.I whine and I twist, but she says No, and hauls me off the bed.I shake her off and jump back up and throw myself across my human.Pup-pup shouts No! with panic and I flatten against my human.She coughs again and I lick her chin.Cmon, girl.Dont- Pup-pup starts, and I look at her.Her voice has changed.It was brittle before, but its hitched the way humans voices do before their eyes leak.My humans, because Pup-pup is mine, too, even if this human under my paws is most my human, have always buried their short muzzles into my shoulder when the eye-leaks start.Missy, she says again.I look between her and my human; her breathing has gotten worse.Missy, come, Pup-pup says and when she pulls on my collar, I move to the flooraway from my human.I whine and press my chest against the side of the bed, but I cant reach her.Pup-pup takes my place beside her.Theres room enough for us both, but I dont think shed appreciate it.Instead, I place my chin on the blanket and watch.Pup-pup takes hold of my humans bird-like paw and holds it between her young ones.She inhales sharply, and on the exhales says, I love you.Ill Miss you-

My human exhales.My humans pup walks in with her mate.In his paw is my leash.I ignore him when he hooks it to my collar and tugs once, lightly.I grunt, and he tugs again.I whine and snap at him.He drops my leash and I jump up on the bed again, moving to my humans other side and snuggling up tight against her.I place my chin on her stomach and prick my ears.Pup-pups mother places her paw on her mate when he reaches for my leash.Instead, he sits beside Pup-pup, and Pup sits on my side of the bed.I turn my head to look up at my human.I lick her chin lightly.Her eyes are closed, and I can hear just how weakly her heart is beating.My humans pup puts her paw on my back.I glance at her, but she doesnt make me leave.I give her a small tail wag, and her lips move, but dont part.Her cheeks are shiny.This pup drove the car that took my mom away, when she was gray in the muzzle the way my human is now.Dogs arent eternal, but humans are.Or something close to thatlike stars, theyd always been and always would be.My human had been her human, had been her fathers human, and so on.Pup had used the great air-sucker, the loud one I learned to bark at because my mother barked at it, too, to take away the fur that had clung to the soft insides.And though shed thrown away the blanket my mother had slept on, I still smell her on the wind sometimes.I inhale as my human does, and exhale the same.When her chest doesnt rise again, mine does.And keeps rising, and falling, as does Pups, her mates, and Pup-pups.Their eyes leak with salt-sweet tears, and I tuck my nose beneath her arm, expecting her to startle because thats what she should do.She stays still, and so do I, even when the other humans walk out, brushing their paws against my fur.I hear I love you and I hear tears.But I hear no heartbeat, even when I press my ear to her chest and listen until men in white clothes come to take her and her blankets away in a big gray car.
