As the isolation period comes to an end, we are all excited to see what has happened to other countries.Unfortunately here in the United States, we had to put down quite a few rebellions in a very short time, due to the Isolation.We lost millions due to high-yield nuclear weapons that some military factions got a hold of, but we have made ourselves a better country for it.Our extreme aggression, as shown in WWIII as many see it to be, has been for the most part cleaned out of our system.Seeing our fellow Americans dying around us caused a serious change in our attitude towards war.The biggest thing to remember is that, America had only had one other war on their soil before, and that was hundreds of years ago.Here in 2090, we understand true loss, and how much it impacts Americans.I wasnt alive for WWIII, but Ive learned the - obviously - American version of the war.We fought throughout South America, Asia, and Europe, while we made sure the United States itself was untouched.This was the way of America before the war.We wanted to keep ourselves seemingly invincible and an impregnable fortress.After billions of dead, both civilian and military, the UN decided that isolation was the best course of action.On the last day, we watched the world leaders bid each other farewell, get in their planes, and fly off most likely to never see each other again.Now the Isolation is over, and all nations of the world get to interact again.Im excited to see whats in store for us as the internet is reopened to the entire world.the Isolation ends at 6:00 pm tonight.Its 5:59 pm right now.You can feel the anticipation throughout the entire country as we begin to pull out our phones, and are ready to log back in to watch the world open up.Many people, like me, are waiting for the walls to drop around the United States to Mexico.I plan on making my first time out of the country as soon as possible.With the walls coming down on the Mexico-America border, it seems like you can hear the cheering of every person in the United States, and the energy and anticipation of what is in store.The walls are finally down, and we look into another country for the first times in many of our lives.Mexico wasnt the only country there to greet us however.There was only one flag, which looked like the infinity symbol, with pieces of hundred of flags within it.There hundreds of sullen looking riot police staring right back at us.We all look at each other in confusion as a man steps out from behind the police officers, dressed in a bright blue three-piece suit.Welcome back to the world America!While you were gone, the rest of the world reformed itself into one nation.We knew the American patriotism and aggression mindset would not have worked with this idea.

There were outcries from all around me as people were realizing what had happened.The rest of the world had lied to us.Within months, the United States government had decimated billions of acres of land all across the world.The old aggression of the United States came back with a roaring fury after the revelation was given to us.However, we sustained our own losses as well.They had intended to destroy us after we opened borders, but they didnt get very far.The combination of anger and hatred for being tricked fueled every American into fighting back, and it became America against the world, and we won.
