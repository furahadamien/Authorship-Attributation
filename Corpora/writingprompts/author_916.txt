The glass door of my laboratory shattered behind me, the lights flickered, and the ground shook.My co-workers fled.I stood in the room alone."I've come to check on my favorite toy."The demon spoke as he slowly ascended from the floor.In a plume of black smoke, from seemingly nowhere, he appeared.Behind me, he rose from a black tarpit.It bubbled and smoldered as he rose from the depths."I thought that was you.I need more time."I said.He smiled, "I'm getting severely impatient.You owe me."I turned to face this demon."This game is getting old.You don't scare me anymore Lou."He hated when I called him that.Azrael was first before all else.A powerful shining star at the right hand of God.You already know the details of the story: He got greedy, he was outcasted, and bested by his brother Michael.He is, well, he was an angel; known now by many aliases.To name a few: the Devil, the serpent, the adversary, Satan, Lucifer (he really hates that one).The list goes on."You think you're so fucking clever, don't you?You're not.You're nothing."He licked his lips at me with the tongue of a snake.He grinned and laughed quietly.Black smoke exhumed from his mouth and nostrils, "I'm going to have so much fun with you."He has taken this shape before, I think it's his true form.The devil truly had the face of an angel.He had the physical appearance of a very attractive man in his late 20's.He was a walking paradox.He lit hellfire where he stood.But his skin was the color of porcelain and to the touch he was ice cold.He approached me barefoot, and menacingly.With each step he left a smoking black tar footprint.Crunching into the broken glass as he proceeded.I could hear it break beneath his feet."Here, take a seat," he said, with his supernatural prowess, he pulled a chair from across the room and placed it behind me.I hesitated to do as he asked.When I refused, he simply used demonic force to sit me down."What do you want?"I asked impatiently."I don't want anything."He replied."Then why are you here?"I asked."Because I can be."He retorted."I found it, you know.What I was looking for when I approached you those years ago.The key to eternal life.It was in my own DNA.It appears that God did make us in his perfect image, after all.So what does that make you Lou?""Fuck you and fuck God.You know nothing.Do you think he cares about you?Your existence means shit to him.You came to me, remember?I'm here because we made a deal.I don't want anything except that which I'm owed."He stood up agitated."One way or another, the Devil gets his due."He laughed, "You can have your immortality.I've known about it for quite some time.But it's fun to watch you monkeys struggle.Your new found 'eternal life', comes with a few stipulations.You'll figure it out soon enough, I'm sure.You're my bitch.So I guess that makes me your master.I'll see you around, I would avoid sunlight if I were you."Azrael then floated into the air above my head and disappeared into a billow of smoke as quickly as he arrived.Soon, my heart began to race.The palpations came so quickly and everything went black.I collapsed to the floor.When I awoke I was still in the lab.I came to my senses.Everything seemed so crystal clear.I could smell everything.Even the lingering sulfur from where the devil stood, I could hear my co-workers talking in a different room, they were frightened.I stood up.Everything seemed so bright.As I made my way out the shattered glass doors.I realized there was no reflection that stared back at me in the window pane, and the sun began to burn my skin.
