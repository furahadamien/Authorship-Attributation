It was at this moment I realized that my daughter was dyslexic.As I slowly backed up into the threshold of my house, I calmly but clearly said "OK Google, what is Satan's return policy?"Without hesitation, my phone began to play the particularly annoying fiddle solo portion of "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" and as I gazed at the majestic beast in my yard charring my perfectly manicured St. Augustine grass, I suddenly wished I was Jewish.My stomach quickly turned as I caught a whiff of the roasting dog poop my daughter had promised me she picked up from the front yard.I retreated into the house, grabbed supplies from the coat closet and kitchen, and headed back outside dragging my daughter behind me.After calling Satan's steed over from the poop zone, I turned to my daughter and gave her some advice she could use for the rest of her life.I straightened two clothes hangers, placed marshmallows on each, and softly whispered to my daughter "Sweetie, when life gives you a fire breathing pony from Satan, you make s'mores."
