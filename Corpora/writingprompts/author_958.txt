The front of the tag said "nightwing", I moved to turn it over but that ... thing in my front yard curled it's lip up in an ugly sneer revealing dozens, no, hundreds of long thin razor sharp teeth amongst ugly bleeding gums.I snatched my hand back, but the sneer turned into a wretch, and it began coughing.I turned to retreat to the porch, where my wife Samy was watching the strange spectacle.I tripped over a plastic reindeer.Dasher, I think."What's her name, daddy, what's her name!?!", my daughter was giddy, and didn't seem to be disturbed by anything about the scene before us.Not the teeth, not the strange long muzzle, not the mix of fur and iridescent scales which both shone greasily in the Christmas morning sun."Ummm, ugh, nightwing I think" I said distractedly as I attempted to disentangle myself from Dasher and his comrades.'Nightwing' began to hork up a matted smoking hairball onto the melted snow near it's feet.It was 10 below, but I was sweating this near the burning monstrosity."I'm going to name her Rainbow Sparkle!No!Moon Glow!No!Sunshine Heart!"My daughter shrieked."Honey, I think it's name is 'Nightwing" I said in much the same state as before, but now further tangled in wires and blinking Christmas lights."Midnight!No!Snow Feather!"she squeeled, running to her "pony"."No, honey, I think it's name is..." and suddenly I was watching with panicked horror as Gabrielle reached nightwing before I could stop her.Her little life flashed before my eyes as I imagined this nightmare parody of a horse ripping my poor daughter's neck apart with it's long drooling jaws.Instead, the beast knelt before my daughter, who grasped at the tufts of greasy fur, pulling herself onto the things back.Her tail waved excitedly and the small horn nubs at the crest of her forehead seemed to glow a dark red, lurid and difficult to look at, as if they shone with more than just earthy light.Stunned, I only managed to raise my hand and utter an aborted objection, "ugh honey, maybe we shouldn't...."

But it was too late.The strange fur of the beast curled around my little daughter from foot to waist.Nightwing shook and wheeled around wildly.It's strange spasms became more violent, and it leap across our front lawn.The snow retreated before nightwing's mad prancing, and it left brown wet patches of grass in the snow everywhere he landed.I was left half cowering as nightwing leapt about, fearing for myself and my daughter's.But the sparse hairs sprouting from between the beast's mangy scales had formed a strangely secure saddle.She seemed to direct nightwing to wheel about and brought him proudly before her mother and me.Nightwing struck the proud parade pose of a champion, and uttering a horrid shriek and a gout of flame from it's muzzle.My darling child squealed with glee, effortlessly wheeling about and taking nightwing into the Christmas morning sky, accelerating to a near impossible speed born aloft on a rainbow made not of light, but of darkness made visible

My vision clearing, I looked down from the sky and stood up, shaking loose from the mess of wires and Christmas figures covering our yard.Samy was nuts about Christmas.She came up behind me, wrapping her long arms around my waist and chest.I surveyed our front yard.It looked like the aftermath of a brutal Yuletide civil war between plastic Christmas decorations.I noticed movement and saw the Mormon family all lined up at their front window across the street.Ten expressions, all combinations of horror, fear and disgust stared back at me.I waved and shouted "Merry Christmas!".The Smith's shooed their kids away from the window, quickly closing the drapes.Somewhat bewildered, I asked Samy where our little Gabrielle had gone."Oh, around the neighbourhood, and maybe zip into another dimension or two" she replied."She'll be gone for a few hours, let's go inside and enjoy some time alone..." she whispered, gently nibbling at my neck.I could see the life sized nativity scene in our foyer through the open door, and thought briefly about the electrical bill as Samyaza Shemhazai the Awoken, Fallen Watcher, Seer of the Name, Netherbride, Drinker of Solomon's tears and the Hellfire of my loins guided me back up the front steps and back inside."Our little girl's only six, and she already has her first hellsteed!A nightwing from the Great Deceiver's own stable no less!"She said proudly.I looked down at her impish face, seeing her six erect nipples outlined under the thin silk gown.Samy was always horny on Christmas."'a nightwing'?So that's what, it's 'kind'?"I asked distractedly, as my darling Sam kissed and bit at my lips."hmm, yes" she whispered back."oh, so she will get to name it"
