Instead of the rich vegetation and dirt floors he was used to, this place was different.The sun was no longer held in the same place.It was gone entirely, but he could see just fine.The air seemed thick and heavy.Everything seemed to be a shade of black, even though there was still color surrounding him.The sky was filled with stars, but instead of beaming light, it was as if someone poked holes through a pure black canvas that wrapped around the sky.He took a deep breathing, feeling the heavy cold air fill his lungs But he realized there were no lungs to fill.He did it out of habit, and would continue to do so.He looked down at the ground where he would lay.His body was still there, even in this place.As he looked around he couldnt help but feel confused.He somehow understood he was dead.What he didnt understand was why he was still there.He started to head off into the vegetation.He didnt have to worry about being slaughtered by beasts anymore.Or what he feared even more, hunger.As he walked through the vast landscape, he realized that the world seemed no different, other than the shades of black that was draped around every plant, stone, and animal he saw.Life moved on without him, and while he never expected anything less this, this did upset him.The small more timid beast would no longer run and cower when they heard footsteps disturb the earth he walked on.Maybe because they no longer actually disturbed the earth he walked on.As the days rolled past, he continued to look and search for something, but the longer he stayed in the awkward and bizarre realm, the more he became familiar with it.He didnt quite understand it but it almost resonated with him.He lived his life alone, and after he died he discovered that alone was what he was meant to be.However, alone is not the right word for this place.Being alone is not having a person around you.This place was different.This place had nothing.He could watch the beasts roam around and continue with their lives, but no matter what he could never interact with them.He could scare them, or hunt them.He just watched them as they continue on with their simple days.He was placed on this earth many decades ago without purpose.He's never had a reason to do anything, and very little want to discover one.He would just struggle to stay alive.He would hunt to eat, but he never found pleasure in it.He tried to just pick the fruits off of low hanging trees, but even that felt like he was ridding the world of something.He realized that to live was painful.Many hard choices you never want to make but you do so just so you can be not dead.He never cared for it, but he would rather be back at the old place instead of this new one.This new dark place start to feel like home to him, but it held a tone in the air, one he could almost taste.This tone reeked of familiar belonging, but never in a good way.He didnt understand it yet but he would come to.A few months have gone by at this point, and he saw the first man.This was the first man he has ever seen.He never realized how ridiculous he looked when he chased after beasts just so he could live for a few more days.He watched this man all day.At least he assumed it was day, since the more sinister beasts like to prey on those with lesser eye sight like him.This place never held a time.It actually felt timeless, even though he could see that time never stopped.After the man hunted, and tore several large pieces of flesh from the body, he walked through this tame land.He watches as this man walked with purpose.He never noticed before, but it was a walk similar to a mother beast, caring for its young ones.The man reached a small clearing under the canopy of the trees, and in the clearing was another person, but one who looked different.The ongoing observer recognized her motherly features and decided this was not a man, but a woman.She had a bond with the man and they cared for each other.It was something the observer never had.Thats when he realized how cursed he really was from day one.He was never given a purpose, while these two did.He decided that this emotion he felt was too much, and it was time to find a new place to look over, or even leave this realm al together.He never found a better place to go.He wanted to leave this place all together, but he didn't know how.Every so often he would think back to the man and women.Why did they move with so much will?They cared for each other, but it was such an unfamiliar concept to him.If it was so unfamiliar, why did it bother him so deeply?He would occasionally go back to the man and women and watch.She would beat back the vines and saplings that grew into their passing while he hunted.She would build a fire for him and pick fruits while he cooked for them.At night he would get up to fuel the flame, and look around for sinister beasts that might attack.Why did this spectator hate watching them so much?They acted no different than the beast he would watch at all hours of the day.What he assumed was day.These pinhole stars gave him no satisfaction, only a bizarre timelessness.They couple would couplate on nicer nights, and it would fill the observers veins with rage.Why could he never experience something on this level?Soon they had their first child, followed by more.The family started to grow and their sense of worth would grow alongside with it.The spectator became dull to his emotions, but he always hated that he could never feel something like this.He tried to leave this realm many times, but its thick air always held a curiosity to it that always left him unsatisfied.He started to walk all corners of the earth.He would swim for years in the ocean, stay deep inside caves.He learned everything there was to learn.He soon learned that there was nothing left on the earth other than this pinhole sky realm.He knew that there was nothing after that.It's just where you come to reflect on your life after it ends.Once you're done reflecting, you dissolve into nothingness, to feed the every growing shades of black.So why wouldn't he leave?He soon saw himself back towards the family.There was a roaring fire, bigger than he's ever seen.So why did all the children and the mother look so sad?They looked like they had lost their purpose.He soon discovered that they did.For now anyways.Glooming of the fire was the man.He was looking into it, but he seemed to be different.When the lost spectator would look down onto his limbs and his body, he would see hes former self, just wrapped in this sickly shade of black and nothingness.But looking onto the man, he appeared to be made of the same color was stuck behind the pricks left in the sky.It was a dull white.It didn't shine, but it was light.It was wrapped around him as if someone rolled him in ash.This spectator knew he was in the same realm as him, and just as soon as he laid eyes on him, the former man laid his on the shaded observer.Where am I?
    Youre no longer living
    Im dead?
    I believe so
    So what now?
    This frustrated the man shaded in black.He always thought he would be gone before another soul entered this realm he called home.This place was a place to make peace with whatever cruel thing life did to you.He should have been gone before someone else entered, so they could reflect and realize what life was worth, and how death, no matter how terrifying, can be a gift.Life gives you many beauties, and death makes you appreciate it.Death is the only driving force that life needs.So why has he come to discover this, but never moved on?There was no more reflecting for this man, he just wallows in his own self-pity.Now you reflect.Appreciate life, and miss it.Then appreciate death
    Is that what you did?, the new soul was very curious and felt he needed many answers.This upsetted the man shaded in black some more.I did so all by myself, without so many questions
    So why are you still here?
This was the question that upsetted him the most.He wasnt filled with rage.He realized that he was the first to be gifted death, and even though he learned to appreciate death, he never appreciated that he was the first to die.It made something click for him.Just as death is required to appreciate death, it's the same reversed.However, this man was never gifted life, he was just simply alive.He fed himself, and found small pleasure, but he had no reason, no driving force.Why was this other man gifted a woman, but not him?A family, but not him?He looked into the fellow souls eyes, and say nothing but confusion and dissatisfaction.He then realized what it was about the air here that felt so familiar.Every person is to die, and every person is to hate it.They are to feel lost and lonely and sad and every other emotion that no one should feel at this time.This is a time for appreciation, and nothing more.The first to die realized this.And he understood why he was the first to die.He was never given a life, so he could appreciate death even more.It was simply his goal to live in this shaded world, and to help those that are brought to it.No one should ever be alone in this place, and he understood that better than anyone.Come with me.Tell me about your life.
