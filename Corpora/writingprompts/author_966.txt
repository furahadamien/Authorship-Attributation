The horse was real.Fire and all, it was real, malign and menacing,  Flies swarmed as it pawed the lawn, leaving grooves of smoking death behind.Instinctively, I realized no life could survive an encounter with this abomination.I feared for my soul -- the reality of which I had not considered since high school.Now I could feel with certainty that I absolutely had a weak, neglected soul and that it was imperilled by mere proximity to the creature stalking my house.A low pulsing vibration and hum distracted me from the horror on the lawn to a slender box on the porch.As I turned my attention to it, the hum became a rumble and the box clattered, then jumped at the door."No!"I yelled at the door, the box, the beast.I had never been religious.I suddenly wished I some divine creator to protect me but I was at a loss.I tried to remember any details I'd seen in movies and pop-culture regarding exorcisms, demons, priests -- any words or deeds that might help."I deny you entry!You cannot have us!I cast you out!WE cast you out!Get thee from me, Satan!Hellspawn begone!"I was at an absolutely loss.My husband came rushing down the stairs."Becka, what's got into you?It's Christmas, you'll freak out Janice --" my dearest Jim stopped mid-reprimand as a cloud of foreboding began filling his senses as well.He got one momentary glance of the equine threat, but had no time to react before the box violently smashed its way through the door and into the living room.I screamed before I could stop myself.Jim pulled me with him as he took cover behind the doorway to the dining room.For a moment we crouched there, behind the wall, expecting the room to explode or some hell to be unleashed, but there was silence.Cautiously, I went to peek around the corner, but Jim stopped me.Instantly I felt relief at the gesture.The man I married was trying to protect me."Jim, we have to get Janice out of here.We have to face whatever this is before it gets to her."I didn't know why this black curse was on us, but I was not going to let it get to my child.The silence persisted as an augur of ... something.I did not know what would come, but the vibration had stopped, the noise had stopped, and a stillness had descended.I gave Jim a pat on the arm as I peek around the corner.My heart first sank and then raced to see our daughter, just seven years old, descending the stairs as if sleepwalking.Without thought, I burst from the meager shelter of the dining room, past the box -- now sitting pristine on the coffee table amid scattered clutter -- and up the stairs to my one and only baby girl.Janice shuddered as if waking as I swooped her into my breast and hurried both of us up the stairs.I gave no thought to Jim as I hurried my child into her room.She began a sleepy complaint, "It's Christmas mommy, I wanna get my presents.""Not yet, hun.Something bad happened last night.We're going to have to do Christmas later.""But it's Christmas!You can't do Christmas later!Besides, Santa sent me a pony.I know it.I dreamt it.Santa talked to me last night and told me so."I held her by the shoulders and asked with love and sternness', "Tell me exactly.What do you mean, honey?Tell me everything.""I dreamt Santa last night.He talked to me.He wasn't like I expected, though."Janice's voice became a sing-song.  "He was big and red and surrounded by elves.He had his red suit, but no white trim.Just all red.Even the ELVES were all red.And they had these BIIIG pointy things.And they were dancing around big big bonfires so huge you can't believe it.And it was toasty warm to keep the winter cold away.And it smelled like boiled eggs!I guess elves like eggs?And Santa said he got my letter and he would send me a pony present!And I was sooo happy!And Santa laughed."And my Janice pouted thoughtfully on this, "But it wasn't a 'Ho ho ho' it was more a 'Muwahaha'... " she trailed off that thought and continued with a slow realization."You know mommy, I don't think I liked Santa.He was saying stuff that sounded mean.I think he was angry.""Baby," I tried to comfort her, "I don't think that was Santa.I think that was a very bad man, and even if he did send you a present, I don't think we want presents from very bad men."Janice had to think on this."I reaaalllly want a pony."Her father cut in.I felt simultaneous remorse that I had left him to whatever fate might come and that he now stood before me and Janice seemingly unharmed, "Janine, hun, one of the 'presents' is a box addressed to mommy and daddy.It has your Santa letter in it, honey."I interrupted, "-- You opened the box?""No!"he gave a look expressing the insanity of the mere *idea* of opening the thing, "As you ran by, it opened *itself* and there was the letter.Addressed to Satan.Not Santa, no.**Satan**."He continued."There was also a contract.The 'present' is free from any and all attachments and obligations.Removal of said present...  that will cost us one human soul.It is between us to decide whose."
