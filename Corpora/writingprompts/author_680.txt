By 57 years that drug would have been improved a thousand fold so the generation with the first drug and its side effects shouldn't be considered a failure.All people go out eventually, but they got to live to about 81 healthy as in their 20s.That's a huge win.The immortals after that will have to deal with overpopulation, resource management and a lot of other issues.
