My Grandpa, Pops, always said money couldnt buy you happiness.Pops said a lot of things, and while some of them proved rather bizarre as he got older, on *that* one I always trusted him and he pretty much always proved to be right.When I was 11 he sat me down to talk about money.I'd never thought about it, never *needed* to think about it, it was just something we had when we needed.He told me about old vs new money.Old money is money handed down from your family, while new money folks had earned it recently.I asked him which we came from and he laughed.We boy, are from something else entirely, hed smiled at me.Our money's not old, its *ancient*. 

It was years before I properly understood him.Our family had been rich for longer than most countries had existed; we owned the companies that owned banks and we shifted investment portfolios that dwarfed the GDP of major world countries, but Pops explained that we did it quietly, behind the scenes so to speak.When I at last began to understand, I asked Pops if we were part of a group I had heard about on the internet, the Illuminati.Folk seemed obsessed that there were secret groups running the world and it intrigued me.He laughed, they existed, *of course*, but they were 6 or 7 levels of control beneath where Pops was.I never quite had the courage to ask how many levels were above him...When he died, I was left alone.My parents had died when I was a baby, he'd raised me by himself and now I was the last of our family.Id been educated, taught what I needed to know about our business and given links to all of his wealth, influence and power, but the one things hed taught me above all others, was how *not* to use it.That left me in a pickle, for what do you do when you have enough money to do whatever you want and no one to share it with?My friends were few and far between, but nice and all getting on with their lives.I'd gone to public Schools and done well enough, but m real education had been in Pops kitchen, sitting in front of the fire while he whittled and told me what I needed to know.I had trillions in the bank, but nothing I needed it for.well, to be honest I owned the banks by and large too.It turned out that life isnt much fun without a challenge.Like a computer game with cheats turned on, after a while it becomes stale and boring.For a while I tried to live Pops life, working a small hog farm in rural Minnesota, but that wasn't for me, that was still trying to be someone else, trying to be *him*.For a year or so I lived like Dan Bilzerian, but without the publicity or the weird thing that no one ever talks about.I spent money and tried everything in the world I wanted, but... it wasn't actually all that fun.I needed to find my own place, my own level.So thats what I did.Turns out though, that with no experience on your rsum and having only half paid attention in school, you're not qualified for much.***

At 4:03pm every single day, the Compliance Officers of the National Bank Insurance team stood up en mass, as the phone lines closed for the day, and headed for the kitchen.I was going to be late, as usual, as trainees needed to do double the paperwork and if I didnt get it done now, then I would be staying late again this evening.I offered a small prayer that someone might save a decent biscuit for me, rather than being stuck with just a plain digestive and hunched over, trying to fire through the forms to get them in as quickly as possible.A looming shadow cut me off mid thought and hovered over me in a mildly sinister way.Aaah, Jimbo? It was Stuart, the team manager and a man who seemed to exude grease.His voice seemed to whine, each note dragged out as if it hated coming from him as much as I hated hearing it.Id told him a number of times to not call me Jimbo, but Jim, yet he ignored me each time.Hi Stuart, Im just getting these finished up before 

Uuuuuh, yes, so we need to have a chat, you see, coffee breaks reeeally need to be taken once youve completed your core work.We cant have you just sneaking off for a brew whenever you feel like it! He laughed at what he must have thought was a joke, an annoying hnyak hnyuk noise.I held a breath for a second to stay calm.No problem Stuart, as you can see, Ive not moved and am completing them right now.

He didnt listen, or if he did, he didnt care.You see Jimbo, if you want to get ahead, you have to learn from me.I started here just eight years ago and worked my way up, you cant just expect to get given a good job in this world.

No, thats fine, if I can just crack on with

You see, investments are a bit like seduction. He perched on the corner of my desk, polyester shirt crinkling and reflecting the light from the strip lighting overhead.I began to wonder if he was still a virgin.You cant just thrust forward, you need to take you time, do the *reeeesearch* Jimbo.

That confirmed it, he was both a virgin and seemingly knew fuck all about investing.A small part of me wondered if he could possibly handle the truth about me, but that was the problem really.This game only worked if you committed, if you *lived* the life you were pretending to live.If you simply flashed your cash at the first problem, then it

He ruffled my hair.Youre just not a *natural* Jimbo, but if you stick with me, maybe youll manage to get there.

I smiled, drew a hand through my hair, feeling his sweat that had rubbed off into my hair and tried not to gag.Fuck the game.I pushed my seat back, knocking his legs so he almost fell off the desk.Yeah,.thanks *Stewy*, I gotta take a whizz, so you hold tight.

His mouth gaped open as I let the little persona I had donned drop away.No more hunching, no more pretending, no more Jimbo.A faint hnyak echoed behind me, making my skin crawl.Money cant buy happiness, Pops was right, but it can buy a *lot* of things, including people wholl do your exact wish on very short notice.I tossed the trash phone I had been using into the nearest bin and pulled out my real phone; a Ziphec tech.As far as I knew, only four people in the world had access to this phone, money alone couldn't buy it, you only got it if you *needed* it.It was simply able to access... more information that usual.National Bank was trading at 6.21 a share and in three quick messages I owned six percent of it and became the largest stock holder.Rules, laws, corporate accountability, governments, all were obstacles that swept away immediately by money.6% was plenty, but 14% was what I wanted to give me enough control to call an Extraordinary General Meeting of the board, which I did three minutes later.I took a pee while a dozen board members found themselves called to a virtual meeting.Men in suits walked into offices, buildings and private homes, regardless of where they were and what they were doing, board members joined the meeting remotely.One was in Brazil watching football, one in Thailand... otherwise occupied.All were located within three minutes.The meeting took less than thirty seconds and the board were dismissed and replaced with my own team, who as I washed my hands, began to order instructions.Two minutes later, as my hands finished drying, a text beeped onto my phone.It was done.It was all done.I went for a coffee, hitting the kitchen just as most of the team were finishing up and feeling only a slight pang to see that all the chocolate biscuits were gone.Still, as I dunked the dry biscuit into my cup of tea, I was happy enough to simply wait for the entertainment to begin.Perfect timing is easy when money and manpower is no object and as I walked back to my desk, the first pieces were falling into place.Stuarts mother was at his desk, a not unfamiliar sight, but today she had someone with her.Most peoples lives are all fairly transparent, their past researchable if you know how and who to do it.For Stuarts mum, the key was an old School flame, who was happy to show up at her door after being offered a sum of money.Youre kicking me out? Stuart screeched.But I *live* there mummy!

His mother, looking happier than I had ever seen her before.Of course the only times I had seen her was when she was accompanying Stuart as his date to the Xmas party.She kissed the woman who stood beside her and they walked out together.They'd be getting a new house in a new city, his mother had been surprisingly easy to convince, I was told.For a moment Stuart stood in shock, but a beeping from his pocket roused him.He fished his phone out and I noted in interest that it was the model down from the one I had so recently discarded.He stared at the screen as alert after alert sounded, confirming the deletion of his level 124 Ork Master General from BattleWorld, the MMO he mentioned on a near-constant basis.4 years it had taken him to level up, but hed find the company helpdesk *surprisingly* unhelpful if he tried to get his account back.Weirdly I felt an actual pang of guilt, but it's not like I was EA.Finally the kicker, his boss, a woman who had despised him for years and barely hid it, walked across the office with an envelope in hand.She carefully hid her smirk as she handed it to him, touched him on the shoulder and shook her head.Sorry Stuart, new owners have decided a round of downsizing is in order. She looked around at the confused faces.Back to work the rest of you.

As he left the office, belongings carried out in a box, I wondered when hed realise that he had no home to go to and then, when hed consider where his pet tortoise was.I slid open my top drawer and dropped in a piece of lettuce  I wasnt a monster, hed get his pet back, but if youre going to ruin a man, you cant do things by halves.That was another saying Pops always liked, but he always was a *very* smart man.***
