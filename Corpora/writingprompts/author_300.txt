Yes girl...doesnt it seem like all these guys are the same?I mean come on!Ive been going on several dates lately and they all have LITERALLY pulled the same lines, same stunts, and not to mention they all smell the same!Well see how this goes tonight, hopefully different

..

Ok, Mr. Shapeshifter tonight we get it right.Im going to do something that different that just might work, Im a little bit scared but I want to be with her and this is what needs to be done.Im going to be honest, kind, thoughtful, and actually listen!Who knew who it could so simple...maybe its my cologne

*she walks into the restaurant*

Miss Palmer?Right this way.
A small and intimate setting of a restaurant.The setting of an old victorian style home, with hardwood floors.Theres a piano player and a lounge singer, doing their best rendition of a Luther Vandross song.Hello Sylvia..
Who are you?
Im your date for the night.
You look a lot different then your picture online.
If you feel uncomfortable or Im not what you expected, I can leave.
She hesitates, then sits down.Well...this is already a lot different then my other dates.
How so?
All these other men just seemed so rudimentary, run of the mill, the same...boring?Hmmm...they must be shapeshifters.
She cracks a smile and laughs
You know I once saw this movie where this lady constantly dated the same man without knowing it but eventually..
