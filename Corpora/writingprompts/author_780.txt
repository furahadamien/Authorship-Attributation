You'd think I would have learned by now.After the third time I was "put to death" for sucking some dude's blood in the park downtown you'd think I would have figured it out.But the problem with sneaking into people's bedrooms to feed myself is something the Governors came up with about 500 years ago.I was a fledgling at that time, but had come to enjoy the freedom of going in a window at night to suck a pretty virgin's blood.Although truth be told, there are many more ugly virgins than there are pretty ones.I digress.The interesting thing about the Rule of Invitation is that a lot more places, like inns and hotels, fall under the category of a house than you would think.Luckily shortly after the rule was set in place, I had a remarkable idea and started to take up woodworking.In this endeavor, I set out to circumvent the Rule that had been set up for our kind.The original idea was based on a theory that if the main entrance had some sort of invitation implied, I would be able to enter any of the doors (or windows as I prefer) of the establishment.So as I improved my woodworking, I began to sell doors and the like to the establishments I hoped to frequent for my meals.After the first wood burned "Welcome" sign I sold to an inn who wanted a diverse clientele, they started to sell left and right.The most amazing thing about this was that my theory was right, it allowed me to bypass the rule and I was free to make my feedings a more private affair again.Soon, it was common to see these signs on almost every inn for 100 miles.It became a sort of status symbol and I was the only one making them.Word spread among my kind, few as we are, of the success I had with getting around this annoyance.Unfortunately, I had to travel quite a ways around the countryside to make sure the people staying at these inns would not get suspicious of my true intentions.The last thing I wanted was a rumor of dead people at the inn around the corner from my home.After all, it was typically my last resort in case a craving came over me when I hadn't prepared to travel.Then it just so happened that I had even more luck in store.Individuals started to take notice of the "Welcome" signs at all the places they frequented.They started to equate them with a certain status.This led to a local rug maker being commissioned to make one for a patron's front door.Partially the reasoning I heard behind making it a rug was to be able to kick the dirt off before entering their home.But I was thrilled with this development.It just so happened the first commission was the local Mayor.This equated another kind of status with the decoration and prompted other individuals to follow suit in order to improve their social standing.I'm sure you see where this is going, but my original handiwork insured that my brethren and I would have unlimited access to private properties in addition to the establishments we had already gained access to.No more feigning death while being strung up in the town square.No more public humiliation at the hands of these inferior beings.I could finally enjoy my meal in the peace and quiet of someone elses bed.
