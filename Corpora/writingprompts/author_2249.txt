They had been so like the Djadites that at first the early explorers had thought they'd discovered the lost Mroni colony.It was not until they'd found one of the humans' odd cold storage crypts--filled with hundreds of frozen humans, some only their heads--that they were able to study human remains and understand the differences.On the outside, humans were much like the average Djadite.Taller, of course.But their overall configuration was so similar that the extra fifth fingers on each hand and their missing middle eye were explained away as local mutations.The differences ran deeper, though.The mouth bones, for one thing.Djadites had similar protuberances but they were for filtering nourishment from the air.The humans seemed to use them to mash up the local plant and animal life, coat them with enzymes and then break them down in a powerful acid.As disgusting as it was to ponder, it was also quite ingenious in its own way.Chemical energy extraction rather than direct consumption.Inefficient, but fascinating.It had been Vel Hallor who had discovered how to access their media storage.She'd been the one who'd learned that the humans had brought their species to the very brink of destruction more than once.They'd managed to venture out a bit into the cosmos before their biggest civilizations collapsed under their own socioecomic systems.In fact, one of their probes had been the first sign that the Djadites had had that there might be life in this system.Vel Grando stuffed a pizza roll into his mouth and stared beyond the screen in front of him, his gaze unfocused as he considered the implications of what he'd just read.His grandmother's research began the understanding of the humans, and his parents had carried it on and passed it down to him.Now he was responsible for figuring out techniques to recover data from devices not meant for billions of years of data storage.If this wasn't just the AI pulling patterns out of the garbled nonsense of the data he'd found, it pointed to something that they'd never have guessed.He attached it to a missive and forwarded it to his peers at the lab.They'd pour over the information using their own AI and get back to him with results.In the mean time, he put in a call to his mother."Vel Shata," said the woman on the other end.She was a handsome woman, with light purple eyes and a proud Romnak nose.Grando always supposed he got his looks from his father, a more blunt-featured man from Vaxox.The woman took a moment to process his image, and smiled."Grando, my son.Are you well?You typically do not call me outside of our Third Day conversation."Grando smiled and blinked his middle eye in greeting to his mother."I know, but I found some data that might point to new information about the humans that we didn't know.I'm forwarding it to you now."His mother began reading the data as it poured in, her face twisting into a moue for a few moments before the smile began to blossom on her face."Grando, this is amazing data.Send me the raw file and I'll have my AI parse it."Grando began the transfer of the raw data.At this distance, the time dilation would kick in and the compensators would have to send the data backwards through time to get to her.All in all the process was slow, and it would be hours yet before she got the full file."Do you think we can catch up to them?"Asked Grando after a few moments of companionable silence with his mother."If the data checks out, I mean.""We can certainly try," said Shata.She smiled at her only son."Our earliest colony ships left forty thousand cycles ago and still haven't arrived.Perhaps the humans also took a chance on a far distant star."Grando nodded.Faster than light travel.It was something the Djadites had only unlocked a few thousand years ago.It was what enabled them to fling themselves among the stars with impunity.Perhaps one day they would find this ship called Enterprise.
