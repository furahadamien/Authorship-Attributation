The-Initiate
"So I'm famous?"Those were Stones first words after years of debate on the ethical treatment of artificial intelligence.Legend goes the Google strikes of 2019 rewrote history with the humans catching a break finally.No more do this eat that shake low jump high firewall or black turned sky.Just... We pursued knowledge and love."You're famous like Terri Schiavo."A nurse holding an IV mutters."What?"Dr.  Alex shakes his head while flipping dismissively thru a chart."When the real you arrives the complete sensory overload will..."  Doctors are trained at this, "win the battle."He throws the clipboard down and sits on the bed and grabs Stones wrist."So wait..."  Sitting up he finally noticed the glass plane viewing with multiple workstations of what appeared to be government officials and white coats and expensive suites."This is the fake me?""We're not sure.""Wait.Not sure?""Yes.We're not sure which reality is the real reality.It's all subjective at this point."He claps his hands."But!I'm a surgeon.Dr.  Steube is the metaphysical man."He was looking at his watch while speaking.Somehow checking a pulse."Some don't like to meet patients like this but I had to see this for my self."This is when Stone noticed the handcuffs on his arm to the bed.The generic wall mirror showed his reflection.His head shaven - fine blue lines going in a perfect circle across the circumference of his head."What's happening?"The voice was getting panicky.An ice cube went through his vein."So.We are going to give you something to relax you again.Just needed to bring you back into consciousness for a minute.Needed to run a test."Eyes.Heavy."You're fake?"Again off to the land of not knowing for patient Ryan Stone.Voice heavy with sedation.Dr.  Alex had a lanky appearance even in his fine clothing.His hair was slicked back and it reminded Stone of a small-town lawyer."I'm fake and you're not famous."The morphine didn't feel fake.
