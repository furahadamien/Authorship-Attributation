Paradoxically, it can be quite unlucky to be born with a luck rating of 100.Michael idly played with his balisong as he looked out onto the courtyard of the Facility.Designed, built, and run by 100's to acquire and contain the 100's that have been born to the wrong side of luck.Born into a nice and loving family?More likely than not to learn how rely on attributes other than luck.There are some outliers, of course, but being born into an unloving or abusive family will likely turn those 100's into the type of people who'd coast on their luck throughout their lives.And if you solely rely on your luck to breeze by in life, you're more likely to abuse that luck and exploit the less lucky.Michael was definitely one of the later, or at least, he had been.After being found, tested, and brought to the Facility, a level playing field, he learned, albeit a little slowly, the thrill of risk.Here he could play games of chance and not know if he was going to win.The thoughts of exploiting less lucky was boring to him now.There's no thrill in that, no risk.He was happy to stay at the Facility and help other prisoners adjust to Facility life.Michael flicked his knife shut as the front gates opened up.A compact, nondescript, black sedan entered the Facility.The other 100's in the courtyard stopped their activities to watch the vehicle pull up to the admittance building.The front doors opened, and two men black suits left he car.One man went around to the back door while the other approached Michael.He nodded."Michael," the man said.The other man opened the door to the car."Stewart."Michael smiled at the man."New arrival?"A teenager darted out of the back of the car as soon as the door opened  and sprinted towards the gates.He made it all of three yards before he tripped over his own feet and crashed to the pavement hard.All the other 100's winced in unison, including Michael.He remembered his first day here when he tried escaping as well.He was never one to watch where he was going, and with all the other 100's here, his luck had been nullified.Just like the kid, he too tripped and faceplanted into the hard, unforgiving asphalt.Stewart winced as well."Yep.Caught him robbing a bank where a 100 was working.Just walked in grabbed the cash, and almost walked out before the 100 stopped him."The other man walked over and picked the kid up by the crook of the elbow and pulled him to admittance."Anyway, you can show him around the facility later.The boss wants to see you."Michael raised his eyebrows."He does?"He clapped his hands together."It's been a while since I've been on an assignment.What is it?""He can tell you the details, but it sounds like an information gathering mission with a chance for assassination."
