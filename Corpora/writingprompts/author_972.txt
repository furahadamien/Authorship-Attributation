"Merry Christmas."We all murmur.Another year, another Christmas day.I walk outside and I am greeted by a warm glow coming from the horizon.I find myself unable to prevent flashbacks to the day this all started.Tears well up in my eyes and painful memories assert their dominance in my mind.Ah, perhaps I should take you back to where this all began.Let's go back a bit.To the Christmas of 2017.My daughter was my pride and joy.She was a bright girl at 8, always interested to learn more about the world.She was even excelling at dance lessons and could even play the piano!She had also become bolder at not so subtly asking for Christmas gifts.She was determined to make me buy her a pony.She mentioned ponies at in the morning, after school, and at dinner every day!Finally, after a particularly busy day at work, I was exhausted and decided to stop the nagging.I said, "Honey, if you really want to get a pony this Christmas, you need to write a letter to Santa!He'll be sure to get you what you want as long as you're a good girl and give your father a bit of rest!You better hurry though, Christmas is in two days!"A sparkle lit up her eyes and she responded with a simple, "Okay!"Fast forward to Christmas morning.I'm deep asleep but then I hear joyous screams coming from the front yard.Still groggy, I forced myself out of bed and and dressed myself."What is going on outside?"I said to myself.I shuffled down the stairs, opened the front door, and felt my jaw plummet to the ground.Standing in my front yard was my daughter and menacing pitch-black horse.The horse was truly awesome, with a mane that seems to float and a muscular body that seemed to defy possibility.It saw me at the door and reared back, opening it's mouth and shooting FLAMES towards the sky."Look, he got me a pony!"my daughter yelled with excitement.A pony.A fire-breathing monster of a pony.It was then that I noticed a letter left by the door.I picked it up and read:

"I have heard the pleas coming from the depths of your heart, and have chosen to grant you that which you desire.Know that I will be with you forever in exchange for this gift.Yours eternally, Satan."Now, I was never a religious man, but I found myself begging God for help almost immediately.I was on my knees praying for salvation when my daughter spoke."What's wrong?This is what I wanted for Christmas!You told me to write a letter, so I did.You should be happy that things worked out and you didn't have to do anything."she said.I was not in a great state of mind and responded harshly with, "I said to write SANTA not SATAN!Apparently the ruler of Hell is real and you just received a favor from him!"My daughter now had tears in her eyes and screamed back at me, "Well at least he does something for me!I asked you to come to my dance recitals, and you never show up!I want you to help me with homework, and you're too tired after work!You never pay attention to me!You just sit around pretending to listen to me and then you tell me to do stuff by myself!Right now, Satan is more of a father to me than you!"I was speechless.She was right that I had been a bad father.I couldn't even say anything as the horse lowered it's body so my daughter could get on and then they ran off down the street.Back to Christmas morning, 2018.I'm sure you can see where this is going now.Maybe I'll have the fortitude to tell you more of the story another time.Let's just say I tried to get my daughter back, but my daughter chose the devil over me."Hey, are you gonna helps us clean the ash off of the roof?It's gonna collapse if we leave it the way it is!"says Bob, one of the people living in our shelter."I be right there, the eternal fires on the horizon reminded me of the sunrise!"I say."A sunrise at 12:30 am, huh?"Bob responds, "Even if the ash clouds weren't blocking the sky, your timing is way off buddy.Now help us clean this roof so we can get back to searching for the bastard that caused all this!"I let out a nervous sigh and whisper to myself, "Merry Christmas."
