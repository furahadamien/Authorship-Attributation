It was raining.Again.All day.The drains were starting to back up.Drip
Drip
Drip

Michael sighed.He was sick of rain, all it ever did in this country was rain.And now it was coming through his ceiling.Michael reluctantly grabbed his jacket deciding he needed to go to the hardware store.He locked the door and turned around, he noticed that it was darker than usual, even in the rain.The sky had an almost sepia tone to it.Shrugging it off he started walking down the street, out of the corner of his eye he saw a sudden movement.Glancing over he saw a man in a full length raincoat.*Just some guy*

Soon later he reached the store and set about gathering the supplies for his damned roof.Suddenly the lights dimmed.Michael swore for a split second he saw the rain soaked man.He shock his head and turned to grab the screws off the shelf.Instead of finding screws he turned into a solid wall of wet rubber.*"Drih dew jusb-pa, Michael hauej kuk"*

Michael looked up at the towering figure, had it always been this tall?Did it say his name?Feeling a thrill, Michael started to back away.*"Drih dew!!"* the towering figure boomed.The thing reached into it's 'jacket' and Michael turned to run in panic."Stop human," said the creature, "you are Michael correct?Related to the human known as Paul Young?"Stunned and trying to comprehend what was happening, Michael tried to think.Paul Young?He vaguely remembered his father telling him about someone by that name.Then it clicked.Paul Young, his father's Great, Great grandfather.He died in 2018, it was said to be suicide but his children and decendants didn't beleive it.Not that it mattered to Michael, some long since dead man meant little to him.It *was* 2201 after all.No, Michael was safe in his own little bubble on this facsimile of ancient Earth.He didn't need anything, want for anything other than a choice to move to a less rain swept continent.At least the designers had got that right...

"You are Michael, yes?"Asked the creature again, "I apologise for scaring you, my autotranslate device hadn't downloaded enough from your information net to vocabularise my speech.""Alright..." 

"You must be stunned by my magnificence.""You could say something like that," Michael replied sarcastically."Or not," said the creature dryly, "in any case I am in the simplest terms you can understand, an alien"

"Simplest terms, yeah okay," Michael looked at the creature in pity.It was clearly a humourless creature."The Earth Confederacy, has been around for 150 years the concept of alien life isn't unknown to us.""But this world is primitive?"Argued the creature the only advanced technology is fission based energy.""A copy, facsimile or whatever you want to call it, real earth died.Some of us live here to avoid the rest of humanity," Michael snapped back, "what do you want alien?"Sensing an opportunity to get back to the point, the alien withdrew a small cylinder from inside it's schmock and handed it to Michael."This is from your Grandfather.It is the collective will and testament that you are now the sole inheritant to the title of EMPEROR and the ruler of the Prax Empire.""You have got to be kidding me?""What is kidding?"The alien dipped his head listening to something, "ah a joke at your expense.I assure you not.""I don't want it.""It is impossible, it is mandatory."Michael started to back off, he knew he believed this creature.But he was happy alone, with his colours, the rain, his *family*.He couldn't leave them.He needed to get home before things rotted.It was also mandatory.Michael sniggered to himself."What is your name alien?""My name is long, so I shall be called whatever you deem it"

Michael pondered a moment, he needed something fitting."You are called Meat, creature"

"By your will Emperor.""I need to return home and gather my things, can you come with me?"Of course, in fact if you will allow it I can transport us there instantly.Why not Meat, what do we do?Meat clasped his shoulder."It is done"

Michael blinked, disoriented.Slowly he opened his eyes and sure enough he was home, he turned to the creature and saw that it had disrobed.It's long slender neck exposed.Michael grinned, as he reconsised it's weakness.He went into the kitchen as the alien started jabbering."Michael, your grandfather purchased our Empire long ago.He used the last of his savings to do so.He was our first human ruler.He was a great man.He sought to unite our species.Even bred with our females to bring genetic unity."Michael grinned, some more, hoping this annoyance to his life would continue.The colours were swirling in his mind.He could feel what was coming.Meat looked around, Michael had his back turned.His purpose was reaching a crescendo.Soon he would return home, at last.The alien peered though a crack in the door behind him.He could smell what was in there.Could smell it from the street.He knew what it meant.He also understood the undertones Michael had used before coming here.What Michael didn't realise was why he was here.Michael returned from the kitchen, but Meat had gone.Looking around Michael clasped onto the knife behind his back.His eyes darted as he sought his prey.He didn't hear a sound until Meat rematerialised behind him and promptly knocked him to the ground, imobilising him."Michael," said Meat, "I lied to you.I have watched you for many years I have seen what you have done.I had hoped your grandfather was an isolated case amongst humanity.But I was wrong.You are vermin.Your grandfather came to my world and killed, raped and poisoned our world.Because he thought he owned it.You are his heir.You have killed your family and you keep them in that room.I am a product of your grandfathers experiments.I am half human.I am vermin just like yourself."Michael couldn't move, his eyes watered, he tried blinking but it was impossible.His grandfather had lived and was apparently just like him.He thought of the cold embrace of his mother's boney arms, imagining her sweet scent in his nostrils.This alien vermin gesturing in front of him.He laughed to himself.So here it is.Meat looked at Michael in sympathy.This being the second human he had met, surely the rest of his species wasn't the same.But then again his homeworld was dead.Brought about by human hands or so his device told him.He concluded that humanity was a stain on the universe."Michael, you are now free of your obligation of Emperor, as will humanity be eradicated from the universe.I was sent here as a test of loyalty by my people.I was a subject of your grandfather.I will be glad to kill you, Brother..."
