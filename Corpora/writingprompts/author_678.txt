Life expectancy drops due to people becoming more active because of their "youth".Rock climbing accidents, Sky diving fails etc.Few people live past the actual age of 60-70.But about 600 people in your country just turned 83 and within a week had fully re-aged and developed a strange and unknown disease similar to late stage leukemia but twice as aggressive and untreatable.Their bodies wither away and are left to suffer the last few moments as their bones turn to dust inside.And your wife turns 83 in two weeks.
