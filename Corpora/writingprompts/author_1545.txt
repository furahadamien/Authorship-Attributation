"Dearest Garfield, 

In regards to your request that I pay a renter's fee in order to maintain my occupancy of your mind, I've enclosed a sum of 3,000 USD in this envelope you see placed upon your desk.Don't worry how it got there, I had a little helper aid me in that trivial affair.Given the current monthly rate of your flat I feel the sum is rather appropriate, although might I suggest a lovely home further inland from the Bay Area?It is so terribly expensive to live in San Francisco and it's such a shame to pay so much for such an itty bitty living space.Although, all things considered, I suppose I should be the last one to speak of such matters, wouldn't you say?Warmest regards, your friend, flatmate, well wisher and closest confidant..."

He could barely stomach reading the next line-

"...Garfield"

Garfield crumpled the letter up.He stared at the cash sitting on the table, as his mind raced and his worst fears manifested themselves.No, he could not assume the worst, he knew he was sick, surely this yet another manifestation of that same sickness?Sleepwalking was possible.Yes, that had to be it.He must have written the letter in his sleep, or perhaps in a trance he didn't remember.The money must also be his, withdrawn from the ATM at the grocery store down the street.While concerning that so many events could transpire without his full consciousness, this was preferable to...the alternative hypothesis.Yes, it had to be so, it MUST be so.He'd just quickly verify the truth as he knew it, and then perhaps ask his doctor for a sleeping pill prescription...

Garfield felt his heart climb into his throat.During his mental processing of the transpired events, he'd begun the login process of is online banking profile, to confirm that he'd withdrawn 3,000 dollars via ATM as he'd hypothesized.But the account was untouched.The last activity was a frozen yogurt purchase he'd made 3 days earlier.There was no 3,000 dollar withdrawal.In fact, Garfield didn't even HAVE 3,000 dollars in his checking account to withdraw from (a fact that he'd tried to suppress as it gnawed on him), and there'd been no transfer from his savings into checking either.There was no way to account for the mystery 3,000.Worse, the letter had been written in a neat cursive.Garfield's cursive was illegible even to himself, and he'd been out of practice for many years now beyond the occasional signature.Where did this money come from?And who had written that letter?And why did they sign the letter with Garfield's own name?Garfield refused to accept the supernatural.There had to be a rational explanation.There was no such thing as a voice inside your head that could write you a letter and pay a renter's fee.This was a joke.A cruel, and elaborate joke.He was the victim of some sick reality tv show.Or it was the government, the government was *spying* on him.This must have been some idea of an "office prank" over at the FBI.No, the CIA.Or maybe the NSA?It had to have been all three, and the Coast Guard too.He'd always mad fun of the Coast Guard, and now they wanted revenge.Yes, they were all in on it, it was a secret plot to destroy him.Damn the Coast Guard!But why him?What had poor Garfield ever done to anybody?Why should he deserve such torture?For the letter and the bills had truly unnerved him.For it to be possible, someone must have access to Garfield's flat.They had been able to break and enter into his very home, his refuge, his sanctuary from the outside world.He felt violated, he felt sick.How could they have got in?He frantically checked the windows.No broken panes or locks.He checked the doors.Same story.They must have a key, that was the only explanation.He'd been betrayed, double crossed, sold out by the landlord.Wasn't the landlord's brother in the Coast Guard?That must have been it.He'd identified the motive, there could be no other logical explanation.Oh how he hated the Coast Guard!Well, no more would he be victim to this Orwellian government scrutiny.He would protect himself and his home.I "they" had a key, well, fine then.Garfield would play one step ahead.Never again would they confuse and humiliate him like this.Garfield set to work with wooden 2x4's and hammer.All he needed to do was board up the door, then nobody could get in while Garfield was asleep, and leave mysterious letters that filled him with fear.Best board up the windows too, in case they get crafty and decide to enter in that way.
