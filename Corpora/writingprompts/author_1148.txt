I was dead...at the moment I was born.It was too late because I'm already dead.I've been given a name, a country, a religion, a skin color and assigned sex.Everything was decided for me and they all expect me to fight for it.And this book...as thick as crackers of a biscuit.At the last page...Page 50."Went outside to find the perfect view to be run over by a car.You could have live this time but the world is too cruel.The car left seeing that no one saw the incident.You were left there to die.How do you feel old soul?"I wasn't able to do what I want...what did I even want to do with my life?"There's no use fretting over that now, right?""Yeah, It's too late."The voices in my head went...they argued and argued but all of that is white noise to me.Standing in the purgatory, reading my 50 pages book."Maybe...just maybe, In my next life...I will get it right!"- I mumbled as I start to grabbed in, this newly found determination that came from a pitifull pit of my unsatisfaction with life.Afterall, this isn't the first time I lived and wrote my life's story in a book.Afterall, there is always a second chance for everything.Maybe, Afterall these lives...I'd find her...my other half."Come on!I have my next life to live."- I said to the voices...


"Wait for me.""Well, if I have any?Who knows?She might have gave up living at this point."Tap Tap Tap
