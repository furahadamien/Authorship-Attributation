I refused.It was hard, but I refused.Hundreds of notifications pouring in, telling me to look at the moon but I didnt.Something seemed weirdly off by the idea of hundreds telling me to look at a rock in the sky and Ive never gotten this many notifications before so I simply refused to do what they said.Plus Id gotten an alert to not look at the moon and I trusted my alert rather than whoever was sending me all these messages.I decided to keep my curtains closed and just went to bed.The next morning my suspicions seemed correct.When I woke up there was no one around and the streets were completely empty, no kids playing even though it was Saturday, no one driving through the street, no one even outside.I had no idea what was happening but I kept on going.Eventually I arrived at work to find that no one was there either but I was a loyal employee and did my job anyway.I worked at a local fast food restaurant which was owned by my granddaddy before he passed and passed onto my father, hes was on his last legs too though.No one even came in so I just sat there in total isolation, I checked all my social media to find everyone was posting the same damn thing.Look at the moon.

I decided I might get answers at towns centre so I began driving there to find crashed cars everywhere but no bodies.There were other irregularities like smashed windows, crashed busses, upturned taxis, even an irregular amount of stray cats and dogs.Eventually I arrived at the town centre where the clock tower was.What I saw was terrifying.Nearly the entire town was surrounding the tower staring up at the sky.I approached and tried to get one of the crowd members attention, I recognised him as he sometimes came into the restaurant with his son, I think his name was jack or John or something.I said his name and shook him a little bit he wouldnt break eye contact with the moon.Thats when I realised, the moon must have made them catatonic.I ran back to my car and turned on the radio, trying to think of what to do until I heard a radio transmission by some guy.Hello?Hello?If you are not hypnotised in what we here at the station are calling the lunar effect. Then please come to these coordinates.We need to figure this out, as far as we can tell 90% of the population are under the influence of the lunar effect.

Then it was followed by some coordinates.I turned on my gps and began driving.What was happening?
