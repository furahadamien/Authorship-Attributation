"Is it Christmas?", I asked myself.The sludge-like snow on the ground obscures my sense of time, or even season.The last 20 or 90 months have been covered in ice, it seems.And a blizzard has been forming in my head for years.I've salted the streets in preparation for my upcoming travels into the unknown depths of my mind.It's a slippery-slope that I romantisize and adore.That beautiful, wintery greyness that manifests itself as melancholy and ennui.Comfort resides in the past.And that's where I wish to be.It is there that I await my fate.With an ever-pervasive sense of hope that only fools relive time and time again."There's no future without you, or those before you", I tell myself.Yet, time-again, I find myself saying those words again.It's as if I do not know myself without another, without regard to who the "other" is.They can tell me time-and-time again how loved and accepted I am, but they'll never convince me.And I'll only let them down, as they let down my idolized notions of them.It's not their fault.And it's not exactly mine either.But they can never love me in all the ways I need to be loved.It's impossible.But you could at least spend New Years Eve with me, like you said you would last year.You weren't there.You won't be this year, either.You were never there.... and never will be, apparently.I don't need you... and fuck you.I just want you to remember the wreck you left behind.I want you to realize that the only reason I replied to a "writingprompt" to some complete stranger on reddit is because you told me you could never live without me or forget me.The only reason I'm typing this out is in hopes that you happen to come across this comment, and recognize how incredilbly hurt I am by your actions.My *reactions* weren't great, I'll give you that, but the things you did and said  to begin with -- I never ...I'm not the bad guy, and fuck you for trying to make me think that I was.I might have been the bad guy in my past relationships...but not with you.
