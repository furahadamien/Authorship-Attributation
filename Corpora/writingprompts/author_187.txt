It's 7 PM, and I'm set up in the lobby of the Albany Marriott.My target is due downstairs in about 10 minutes, so I have plenty of time to check over my equipment.Poison needles... check.Ceramic dagger... check.Ballpoint pen... check....oh shit... is that **Fukunaga?**

Fuck.It is.I catch him staring at me from a bush outside.He's dressed in that idiotic ninja garb that screams "**HEY, OVER HERE!!!I'M A NINJA!!!DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU CAN SEE ME!!!**"

Now, I have much respect for the traditions of the *kage*.They were once the great warriors of the shadows, and could infiltrate a castle, kill a man, and leave before anyone was aware they were a target... and best of all, no one would suspect it was an assassination.Then they got cocky.They let word of their deeds out, purportedly to "spread fear among their potential victims."They also let themselves stagnate under the weight of tradition.Meanwhile, most of the rest of the practitioners adapted, learned to blend in the modern world, ditched those fucking pajamas and got better than the originals.So now my mission may be blown because of some short-bus killer who stands out when he should be...

Oh... idea time.Five minutes to go, and I gesture to a coworker."Hey... who is that in the bush outside?""Dude, whatcha been smokin'?Can you, like... oh shit, dude, yer right!There's, like, a guy in that bush!"He points right at Fukunaga.He's speaking so loud that the 4 or 5 guests in the lobby look where he's pointing.I see Fukunaga startle, then duck his head down into his hood.Probably to bite the cyanide capsule he has sewn into the lining.Joke's on him.I swapped it for a Nyquil caplet 2 or 3 years ago in Rome, when he tried to cut in on another job.Fucked that up, too, as he got spotted by a **priest**, if you can believe it, who called the Swiss Guard to report a possible attempt on the Pope's life.(He was kind of close...I was after a cardinal.Took an extra two days with the heightened security.)Fukunaga falls dramatically to the ground to prepare for his "death throes," and I see my target leave the elevator flanked by two rent-a-thugs.I pull the ink part out of my Bic pen, slide the needle into the barrel, and puff hard into the end, I see a brief glint of light on surgical steel, and the point pokes into the target's neck.At the same moment as the victim slaps the needle deeper into his flesh (guaranteeing a painful death 4 hours from now... that's what you get when you rape a congressman's son, you sick Mafia fuck), the gorillas spot Fukunaga failing to spasm in death, and start towards the dumb bastard.I turn to the coworker."Hey, can you take the desk for a second?I have to take a piss.""Yeah, man... don't you want to see the excitement, though?"No, not really.I want to get as far away from here as I can before that greasy pedo drops dead."No...I'v **really** got to go."As I leave the desk (never to return... sorry, dude), I see Fukunaga jump to his feet and run like his life depends on it (which it does, given the size of the bodyguards chasing him) and chuckle quietly.Sometimes, tradition **does** come in handy.
