And then that happened.Yes.Exactly that.Finally, a Bond villain worth his salt!And the applause rocked the globe, for all of humanity - save for a pair of twin Buddhist monks - had by then finally come to their senses about Mr.Bond, and his regurgitated clipshows of ridiculous sex, gadgets, and over the top action.The last reboot had died out.And Mr.Bond was ejected from Earth by rocket-car, a pathetic blast of gas propelling it beyond orbit like so much flatulence, starbound eternal from the ass of our world.Post-haste!James fiddled with the radio.Soon discovered it was one way.There was no switch.The battery seemed set to last *precisely* as long as 007 supposed his air would.It was one way.Loud.He died before they even finished clapping.The celebrations lasted for days.He had found way to end his life quickly.The same day he broke orbit.An agent past his time.A shame.If only Mr.Bond had discovered in life,
