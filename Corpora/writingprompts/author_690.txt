I crawl through the mud, my mind burning with my mission.*There's only him left.*

The world is doomed.The little life remaining on it has only a few months left 'till the planet devours it, and the intelligent life that used to inhabit it has been taken away.Except for me, and him.I glimpse the tiny cabin through the few trees that stand in my path.A figure can be seen pacing through the window, the firelight making his shadow larger and his features grotesque.I know what he's thinking, feeling.He's afraid of me and he knows I'm coming.He fears my knife.The man in the cabin is my father.I love him dearly which makes this harder than it should be.I *must* do this but I've postponed time and time again, not anymore.I reach the final tree and slowly get up, he sees me but it's too late to escape.I sprint to the door and reach it at the same time he opens it.Horror and determination fill his face, the former in reaction to my knife, the latter in reaction to his own.We fight.He is stronger than me, he always has been but my mind is set and my will is fierce.I stop his downward swing with my left hand as my right drives the knife to his neck, at the last second he catches it and throws it away.A glint of victory shines in his eyes but lasts little, my swift right hook makes him stagger and I take his knife away.With one violent swing I cut his throat, he looks at me one last time and I feel my own choking.*He's crying.*

My father falls down, the life draining from his body and I fall to my knees.It's over, I tell myself, it's done.I've killed my father, the other remaining person standing on this rock, with his own knife.The killer responsible for wiping out mankind before the planet itself did.The end looms over me.I weep in a desolate world.
