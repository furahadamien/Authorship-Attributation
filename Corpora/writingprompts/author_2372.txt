Every moment flying

With every drop of strength I expend

Wishing I was dying

The time comes, our duel ends


Some would liken time to a flowing river, a stream that flows in one direction.There are similarities: Something that can be directed and blocked, swam in and observed.Being in it however, seems more like a hurricane.A storm of probability, you are not in reality, you are making it, changing probabilities and trying to not lose your anchor.Zoanthrope struggled to retain his anchor.The world was nothing more than a blur to him, it was a wonder he could even breathe.Was he breathing?Where was he?It was hard to think and with every moment that passed it became more and more difficult to focus.Fear began to overtake him, his mind was fragmented, he was scared to open his eyes but every second that went by was as if his reality was being torn apart.He opened his eyes and tried to get a handle on a path he could open.It was as if he was floating in the middle of a super-storm.Blue and grey four dimensional constructs surrounded him and their existence poked at his brain in ways he could not understand.In the distance he could see it: a fold in space, not the most stunning thing as there were folds all around him but he could feel it, this was the one.Zoanthrope slammed his eyes shut and focused on the fold, he did not move normally, he was just there, and he could feel the rush of gravity almost instantly.The world spun into view and he crashed to one knee, slightly impressed by his ability to even land on his feet, a task few others could do, if they even had the power to do so.With his world still spinning he tried to get everything to focus.Zoan had teleported to a giant slab of black marble the size of a small canyon.In the center a giant castle.What was that doing here?From his location it appeared the giant block of marble was just floating there but before he could get his barrings a voice called out."Finally made it?"Zoan looked up, there was a man with blue hair, and next to him: someone that looked like my younger self.
