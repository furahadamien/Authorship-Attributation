I rolled a joint and light it up.The flicker of flame lighted a sign on the sidewalk where I stood.Smoking is murder, it says.And my name was spraypainted underneath it in red.I crossed the empty streets, not a soul to be seen.I expected as much, as i went along the sidewalk, with my face on posters denouncing my smoking."You'll kill us!Asshole!", one of them said.Ironic that I'm the only smoker left on this world, and the only human left on this planet.I smile ruefully as I recall how the last few years went, as less smokers existed, they cheered and applauded, not knowing that reducing exposure to smoke made their lungs hypersensitive to other gasses and chemicals from power plants, factories and other equipment around them.At first they blamed me, but as certain continents began to choke on their pollution, it was far too late.I took another pull from my rolled up joint, noting the tar that is killing me slowly, is also my saviour, protecting me from the other carcinogens in the air.But hey, who wants to live forever right?I light up another.
