A villian without an ego is just a hero.This is my mantra, this is my cry.I don't remember when this began it has been so long.Perhaps at first I thought I was doing the right thing, maybe I still do.But when my hands approches the red button, something inside me keeps me from pressing it.Something in my hand stiffens up, doesn't allow me to follow through.Everyone that came before me, in the name of peace or order or greed, they all failed.Not one was able to follow through.I thought I could succeed where they failed, I thought putting aside monolouging and fancy rube goldberg laser death traps and riddles would see my success.They thought they were protecting the public, and they thought they could stop me, stop the inevitability.Well they were wrong, but still even after all this I can't bring myself to hit the button.All it is is one press and it's over, I win, but I can't do it.On the floor lay bodies and blood, evidence of my victory.In the rubble there are innocent civilians, police, my henchmen, so-called heros, and now the greatest visionary the world has ever seen: good bye world, maybe you can do better agaisnt the next "villian."*bang*
