Doomsdayrs
I lay down on my bed.Having read a new prompt on a subreddit..The air is cold and chilly, with my blanket and cylinder pillow the only things I am using to keep warm.My family has always said I'm loved, but I know love is not unconditional.Love always has conditions.I hug the pillow, it's cold, but slowly warms to my body heat.I think of the person I like.. they likely don't like me...But I think of them any hows.It makes my life a bit better than it is.Then the memories flood in slowly.How lonely I am, how I may never be loved back.The cold of the air stings my sad body.Then I cry, I cryed so hard.I yearned to be loved and cared for.To feel affection in my cold dead heart.I yearned for the Soviet Union, for communism and peace.For unity and happiness.For all my miseries to end...


Maybe... Maybe one day things will be better... One day...
