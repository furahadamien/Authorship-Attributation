I'll be honest.I wanted to die.Id read that you could dehydrate yourself to death and I figured that might be the least gruesome way to go.I got all my things picked up by the junk collectors for $25 and gave them a $25 tip and a six pack of nice beer, hell, might as well go out generous right?I drove out to the desert.I felt free finally.My car was an old beat up and i hadn't really spoken to family going on 5 years now since my last brothers wedding.I figured we would all be better off if I kind of just dropped off the map.So I didn't really expect to wake up the first day after the fire and falling asleep under the stars.It really was beautiful, you know?Like the universe was welcoming me home, back into itself.But hey, I woke up parched.I knew Id be tempted so I didn't bring any water with me and I had only just enough gas to get to my destination out there in the desert.I began to panic.I had stranded myself.No, no, i forced myself to calm down.This is for the best, remember?Everyone dies and here i am, choosing my death.This is how I go out.I waited patiently for three days.Four.Seven.It became a trance.I was neither here nor there.Time evaporated and all i was left with was now.There were more lights in the skies.I could tell.More flying across the desert skies.My mouth was dry paper and it felt comfortable that way.It was right.I saw the increase and decrease of lights in the skies.My eyes became dry withdrawn sockets and it felt comfortable.It felt right.I sat there.Immovable, immobile.I was here.You came to me and told me the year.My mind slowly, achingly turned back.It was irrelevant the year I left but I managed to piece it together from my birth date.I was thirty eight when I went out to the desert to die.900 years had passed watching the stars rotate across the skies."I will be here" i said.And you left.Who knows how long it has been since then.I will see another again.Someday.Maybe.
