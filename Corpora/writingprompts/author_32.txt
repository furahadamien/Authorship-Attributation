The suite on the sixth floor of the Trump International Hotel, Washington D.C., was decorated in chestnut and tan.The headboard of the king size bed was carved as if it was a coat of arms of some legitimate monarch, and was trimmed with fake gold, which poorly matched the Kremlin red, velvet throw pillows.Like the room's single, useless accent wall, the curtains were a brutal cerulean, suggesting a space that conceals more deception than the dark seabed of a Vladivostok harbor.In all, the suite was reminiscent of something a Tsar might have once maintained, perhaps as quarters for secondary guests in some Eastern Palace.Nevertheless, on that particular Pennsylvania Avenue afternoon, Ajit Pai, FCC Chairman, felt anything but secondary.Ajit rolled over on the sheets, letting his chesthair peak out from his robe, and then stretching all the way from his scapula to his calves.Laying beside him, Lowell C. McAdam, CEO of Verizon Communications, picked another chocolate covered strawberry from the bowl.He placed it in Ajit's mouth, letting his hand linger on his former General Counsel's lips just a moment too long."You know I love dessert," Ajit said, "but I hope you have something else for me.""I don't recall you ever being so direct before, my Sugar Plum" Lowell returned, clasping Ajit's buttocks."Maybe those FTC boys go easy on you," Ajit answered, pulling away, but only a little, only for show, "but I'm from the FCC, so you better show me the cash first!"Lowell sighed.He spun off the bed.He sauntered over to the bureau and picked up a leather briefcase with two silver latches.Lowell showed Ajit what was inside: stacks and stacks of crisp hundred dollar bills."Just to be clear," Lowell explained, "every last cent of this is to repeal net neutrality.You're giving me that ass for free."Lowell pounced down on top of Ajit, groping at him the way a crude man only does to a prostitute.Ajit loved feeling bought and paid for.He giggled and squealed, and the two men kissed.But suddenly, the passion and privacy of the suite was shattered by a flash of light and a thunderous clap.The hideous furniture Ivanka had inexplicably wanted credit for rattled along the carpet.When the two lovers and conspirators regained their composure, there was a strange young man and woman standing before them, wearing tattered jeans and leather vests.They both had AK-47s draped over their shoulders.The woman punched Ajit hard in the jaw."Are you Ajit Pai the FCC chairman or Ajit Pai the cricketer!"she demanded.Her face was stained with dirt."What?Who are you?Where did you come from?"Ajit asked, favoring his chin, his whole body quivering."FCC chairman or cricketer!"the woman shouted again, brandishing the AK-47 at the frightened, half naked businessman, and lobbyist pretending to be a guard of the public interest."FCC!"Ajit replied, "Yes, I'm with the FCC!""You know why she had to ask that, motherfucker?"the rough man began, "because the only other famous Ajit Pai was a fucking cricket player, and where we come from, Wikipedia pages take twenty minutes to load, unless you pay an extra $9.99 a month!So all we really had to go on was the fucking disambiguation page.You know how hard it is to tell an artificially intelligent time machine where you want to go, when all it can access are the goddamn disambiguation pages?"The man picked Ajit up, and threw him onto the bed.He did the same to Lowell."Your little side deal here," the woman explained to the telecommunications executives, "let me tell you how this goes down.First, you repeal net neutrality for some chump change kickback.Then, of course, all the asshole ISPs start tacking on surcharges for people to get on pretty much all the good websites, until nobody could afford more than one.So, the same thing happened that always happens when you force people to choose teams.Society broke apart completely.Soon, the Youtubian Republic was throwing molotov cocktails at the Facebook Moms, and the Netflixtariat were being rounded up by the Insta-thots.Nobody talks to each other or shares anything, and it is terrible."Ajit and Lowell looked to the door and windows, thinking of any possible escape.But there was none.They were hostages of an uncaring power who had no concern for their well being."But there was one silver lining to not having the web you're used to," the rough man continued, "Without an open internet, nobody else got to find out that we finally cracked how to build a fully operational time machine.We didn't tweet about it or do a single AMA.Because why would we?There'd be nobody online to see it.That means we were able to skip all the bullshit and just travel right back here, right to this moment, before you two fucked each other, and then the whole country.""Are," Lowell stammered, "are you going to kill us?"The time travelers laughed, then stuck peculiar glowing orbs on the lovers' chests."No, we're not going to kill you," the woman replied, "instead, we're just going to send you boys into the future you're trying to create.And we'll stay back here in 2017, when things were at least only halfway terrible.""What?No, you can't!"Ajit shouted."Sure we can," the man told him, "because time travel has no regulations.I thought you loved it when technology has no regulation."The woman pushed a button on a strange remote.The suite filled with another flash of light.Ajit and Lowell embraced.They vanished.

The woman comes to the Wal-mart, alone, on a windy evening.The door to the box-store separates for her automatically when it senses her human movements, and she shivers in the vestibule.She is very tired, but still she smiles and nods when Albert the greeter says hello, grinning with his strange teeth.She pulls a shopping cart free, and goes shuffling down the aisles, each full of every commodity imaginable, all stacked atop each other like the towers of some cliffside gothic castle.She only has twenty dollars cash remaining in her coat pocket.It was given to her by Sandra from the community center, who had just that afternoon also invited the woman to live in her house, now that her mother had at last kicked her out for good.Whether the money was a loan or gift is still not altogether clear to the woman.However, the distinction does not matter.Deep down she knows she does not intend to ever repay it."My spare room isn't much bigger than a closet, but this is to help you make it feel like it's yours," Sandra had announced, when she pressed the crumpled bills into the woman's hand, "Get yourself a new little dresser, some sheets, and whatever else it will take.I'll help you set it up tonight after work."Sandra's kindness had initially measured over two hundred dollars.Alongside the spare room, it was all such a gesture that the woman quickly realized she had no concept of how to respond, so she just stuttered a thank you, and then hugged her savior for over five seconds.She told Sandra that she had already become a second mother to her, who, unlike her real mom, understood addiction, and how when people stumble, they need compassion and support, rather than an eviction, and an oath to no longer enable.The woman promised not to waste the opportunity Sandra had given her.But even though she believed at the time that she had meant what she promised, before she was even a mile from the community center, she found herself detouring on her way to the Wal-mart, over to the park where the men in the puffy jackets are always sitting on the same bench.Soon enough, almost all Sandra's money was gone.And now, meandering through the endless Wal-mart aisles, stuffed full everything a human being could ever covet, the woman encounters the sheets and the small dressers, and the prices on them.She begins to cry."Are you alright, miss?"Albert the greeter asks, mincing toward her.He is very old and his skin is quite pale, even under the fluorescent Wal-mart lights.Usually the woman would lie to a stranger and send him along after being asked this sort of question.But, with Albert, for some reason she does want to dismiss him so summarily.Perhaps it is the lilt in the frail man's voice or perhaps it is just the frantic desperation of her situation; regardless, the woman feels compelled to tell him an intimate truth."I think I just ruined the last chance I had at a decent life," she says, wiping her nose on her sleeve, "All because I can't control myself.All because I'm a fucking vampire who just can't stop consuming and hurting people."She goes on to unburden herself to Albert, as if he was a priest, with the kitchenware aisle for his confessional.She tells him about the drugs, how it began with the cooks and other waitresses all reeking of garlic after too-long shifts in the restaurant, how it migrated to parties on the weekends, and then to alleyways and abandoned buildings, how her mother would inspect her forearms with a flashlight and lock up her purse at night, how she went to the meetings, but spent most of it on her cell phone, until it was her turn to speak, when she would stand before the crowd and just lie.She tells Albert about Sandra, and how she doesn't even know what she is doing in the fucking Wal-mart since she has no money left and will never again be able to look that saintly woman in the eyes."Well, if you're a vampire, then I'd say you're in the right place," Albert tells the woman, stroking her back gently, "Everyone in Wal-mart is a vampire in one way or another, just insatiably consuming all this garbage.But, you know, maybe being a vampire is the highest, best thing anyone can be these days.So maybe you should just stop fighting against what you really are."The woman chuckles a little.The old man is more pragmatic than she would have expected."That's all well and good, but it won't exactly help me find a place to sleep tonight, now will it?"she asks."Oh I don't know about that," Albert responds, "I think if you really wanted to, you could still find a way to lay your head at that Sandra lady's place, and I think you could do it without having to ever admit your little slip up to her.Tell me, do you think Sandra has a welcome mat outside her house?If not, this Wal-mart's got a lovely selection of welcome mats, and plenty of them are cheaper than twenty bucks.Maybe all it will take for you to get yourself into Sandra's house tonight is laying down a welcome mat beside her door."The woman looks at Albert with a furrowed brow."Okay now you're not making any sense, what does a welcome mat have to -"

Albert puts his wrinkled, liver spotted finger on her lips.He leans in and whispers in her ear.Her eyes go wide.
