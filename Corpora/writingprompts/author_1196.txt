It's a hell of a thing - being sick on the holidays./u/therunawayguy had been suffering through coughing fits and amounts of snot that no human being should be able to produce for the better part of a week now, and had managed to slog through the holiday grind of seeing old family that he didn't particularly like much despite that.He had hoped that would be the end of things, and he was going to recover soon, but here he lay, six in the morning, sleeping sporadically through hacking and wheezing and sneezing.But as he browsed Reddit on his phone, /u/therunawayguy realized something.That though he was miserable, he was also happy.There had been many things going on that had been rough, but as always, good comes alongside the bad.He had seen and got to interact with family he *did* like.Gotten to see his sister, who he otherwise suspected was depressed, have her face light up at the prospect of getting a video game she had wanted for a long time.Gotten to surprise his mother, one of his personal heros, with gifts that made her break down into tears of happiness.Gotten to give to charity two or three times, when he could normally only barely manage things well enough to care for even his own family.Gotten to look on the internet, and see the beautiful things people have done for each other.From as important as fighting political battles to make the world a better place for everyone, to as wacky as pillows meant to depict a loved one's dog going horribly wrong, to as simple as wishing each other happy holidays.Though he had suffered, /u/therunawayguy realized that this this holiday season had probably been his personal favorite ever, simply because of the little things he had experienced and gotten to do for others and being able to see the joy of others around him.And suddenly, a little sickness didn't seem like such a big deal anymore.Laying there, he decided to type up a little message for the world at large:

"Thanks.It's been a rough time.Haven't been this sick in a while, and truth be told, I still feel like death.But to quote one of my favorite characters, from one of my favorite shows (despite its controversies), 'And yet, I smile'.:) 

As I've grown, it's becoming more and more apparent to me that what makes me happy is seeing others happy, and I've seen a lot of happiness recently, both from my real life and from the internet, particularly Reddit.I'm tired, and going to try and get some more sleep now, but I just wanted to say thank you to you wonderful people.For everything.From r/wholesomememes to charity subs like r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza, this website has done some amazing stuff, especially this time of year, and I'm confident that it will continue to do these things.Keep being cool, Reddit, and never forget that spirit - the drive to help your fellow human beings in whatever ways you can.Doesn't have to be huge.Even something as simple as a meta writing prompt can make someone smile, and if you do that for someone, I'd say you've done well enough.:)"

And with that, he hit 'Add Comment' and closed his eyes, comforted in the knowledge that happiness was all around him, as it was around everyone.
