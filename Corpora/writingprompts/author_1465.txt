Opening up the door, I hear the familiar voice from the living room."Dave, it's time."It says."No, I do what I want, Martha."I reply, knowing it will never actually answer back."Just stop, Dave."Martha replies.I turn the TV off, to stop the ads.In less than a minute, a knock at the door.No one ever stops by."Hey, Dave.It's me, Tim.Can you open up?"Tim says, apparently.I open the door and say, "You're a little big for a girl scout."He calls me an asshole for this."Look, I know we never talk, but smoking is really, really bad for your health."He says."My body, my choice, Timothy."I say."It's just Tim, and I want you to be able to see your grandkids graduate.""Look, Timmy, I hate kids.I'm also sterile and have crippling depression.Please leave me alone."The TV comes back on."Stop smoking, David.""Stop smoking, David."- Tim
"Stop smoking, David."- TV 
"Stop smoking, David.""Stop smoking, David."I didn't.
