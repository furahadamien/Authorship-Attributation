Cold, bright stars shone through the thin mountain air like flickering candles by the time Kentaro-san built up the courage to approach the hut.Set in glade alone, ringed by silent pines, the the wooden hut looked ancient, and it was.First built by the United Ninja Clans nearly four-hundred years ago, it was meant to be a place of quiet reflection and shared experience.A place where the clans of the world would gather once a decade and celebrate their skill and discuss the world-at-large.Now, in these dark times, the meetings that the hut hosted had taken on a new meaning.The heavy wooden door groaned deafeningly as Kentaro-san swung it only wide enough for his thin, sinewy frame to slip through.The interior of the hut was silent and as cold as outside beneath the stars.In the center of the hut sat the great round table that so many of his ancestors and peers had sat at through the decades.A nightbird outside called out to no-one.He was early.As the senior member of Clan Nihon, as well as its most learned, he was elected by his peers to attend this most grave of meetings.A representative from all of the clans would be in attendance: the Shogun-Cowboys of the Americas, the copper-and-cotton Hashassins of the Arabic nations, the brightly-patterned but silent Warrior-Priests of Africa, and the long-hidden tribesmen from the Amazons.Even the Voices of Valhalla from the cold north, who rarely came down from their blissful mountain sanctuaries, would be in attendance.Indeed, the threat from The Orange One was too great to ignore further.To keep his early arrival to himself, Kentaro-san slipped into the shadows on his padded footwear.Wedging himself between a thick wooden stud and an eons-old chair, he prepared himself to meditate silently while awaiting the arrival of his fellow ninjas.Just as he closed his eyes for prayer, he heard the deep, booming Voice of Valhalla call out from seemingly nowhere, and everywhere:

"Glad you could join us, Kentaro-san.Go ahead and dial in - the conference call number is on the table."
