"Seriously?"I asked, my gaze still fixed on the twitching mass that until a moment ago had been my wallet, "the motherfucking Decepticons?""Heh, " came the gruff reply, "I liked that one too.But you ain't far off."The man whom I'd at first thought was a mugger put away his pistol, strode over to the scrap of...of...flesh?...parts?...and stomped a few times for good measure.The squishing and squelching sounds were a little gratuitous.He produced a silver flask, and poured a measure of fluid onto the mess.It foamed like peroxide for a moment, then began smoking.Vivid green.It stank like burning plastic and mildew."So what was it?"I asked.He didn't look up from the shrinking puddle of goo.After a moment, he bent and retrieved three plastic cards, and a little bar coded key fob.I recognized them as mine, and he handed them over.They had bullet holes in them."Looks like it didn't finish digesting everything."he remarked."Ok," I persisted, "but what was it?"He pulled out a pair of dark sunglasses, and produced a little silver cylinder with a red light at one end.I noticed that his dark clothing was a suit."No!No no no no no!"I said, "you are NOT going to flashy thing me!"He chuckled and set the cylinder on the ground between us."Relax.This ain't that.Just shut your eyes and hold your breath.You might need to be decontaminated."I bit down on a reply and complied.The thought of "decontamination" gave me the willies.After a moment, the scent of lilac and lawn mower clippings filled the air, and pink and golden light played across my eyelids.When the light dimmed, he said "You can open your eyes."With some relief, I did.I saw that he was looking at me strangely."What?""You, uh.You didn't have even a speck of contamination.That's rare.""Why?""Look.I can't tell you everything, but this is an unusual situation.Basically, someone bad exposed you to an infectious agent, but it didn't take hold in you.You're resistant.""So if I'm resistant, why the drama with my wallet?""Seems like you can't be infected, but stuff you carry around a lot can.We can detect it if we can get close enough.""Oh" I said, thinking of my phone, "uh..."

"The wallet was the only thing infected.If it had progressed far enough, it could have bitten you-"

"*Bitten* me?""Yeah, bitten.And exposed you to enough of the pathogen to overcome your resistance.Then you'd belong to it.""Belong.To it."He grunted, and eyed me speculatively."This has got to seem weird to you.""Shockingly, yes.""You're taking it way better than I did my first time.""I have to admit I'm half wondering when I'm going to wake up."He seemed to come to a decision."I want you to meet someone.They can tell you more about this whole mess.""Holy hell, you ARE an MIB.Are you trying to recruit me?"He looked at me steadily."Yes."I held up a hand placatingly."Look, man, I still need some time to process all of this.Can you give me a card or something, and some time to think about it?""Your choice, but we gotta do this now or not at all."I sighed."Can we have this meeting somewhere other than a dark alley?"He smiled "Yeah.Come on."I feigned a tentative smile back, drawing back the lips of my newest drone.It seemed the modified spores were working as I'd hoped, and now I finally had an agent poised to be placed among the fools who'd been foiling my takeover of the Earth.Things were looking up.
