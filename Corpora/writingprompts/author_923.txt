His visitor was impeccably dressed.Dr. Ambyth was hard at work in his lab, attending to the numerous vials of chemicals and buzzing machines that populated the counters and workbenches.Dividing his attention between each one was certainly a trying process- more than a few batches had been ruined by less than a gram of mismeasured telomerase.Creating eternal life was never bound to be an easy task, and it had taken him fifteen years to do it.But in the end, he had done it, and now Ambrose R. Ambyth was a trademark name, printed on the syringe that doctors used to deliver liquid immortality straight to the bloodstream of the plutocratic bloodsuckers that gave him a job.He was rich and famous, sure, but he couldn't just stop making it.His buyers demanded a fresh batch by Wednesday, and even he, crafter of eternal life, was a slave to the economy.Which is why he was so irritated when he heard the door ring.At first, when the buzzer rang, Ambrose ignored it.Then, when it persisted, he marched angrily over to the door and flung it wide, intent on verbally reaming whoever dared to intrude upon his work.The man was dressed in a simple black suit with a white undershirt, and resting around his neck was a simple necktie which was a soft, dark green.His face seemed youthful, but weathered.Despite the rather plain features he had, each movement, each piece of clothing and strand of hair seemed to be calculated and precise.It unnerved Ambrose."Greetings," he said in a soft, deep baritone."I presume you are Dr.Ambyth?"Ambrose nodded."That I am.""Good," the man said simply.He walked past Ambrose into the laboratory, examining the chemicals and equipment around them."Fascinating," the man said."So complex, yet so elegant."He turned to Ambrose, who had started ruffling the tuft of slicked-back brown hair on his head."We are quite impressed by your work.I never would have thought a human was capable of this.""Who are you?"Ambrose demanded."Who is this 'we' you speak of?""Ah, forgive me.Where are my manners?"He reached out to shake Ambrose's hand."You may call me Vellaunus."Ambrose shrunk away from this being called Vellaunus."Why are you here?"The doctor spoke tersely and suspiciously, but the spirit gave him no heed."I am one of the Ferrymen.I ferry the souls of those destined to die to the afterlife, and now, my dear Dr. Ambyth, it is your time to go."Ambrose laughed, a short, startled yelp.He was a spirit of Death!He was in no danger at all!Ignoring the nagging voice of his logic, he decided to flaunt his achievement a little."Oh, there must be some mistake, Vellaunus.You see, I am immortal.I cannot die.I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you'll be leaving empty-handed."Vellaunus grinned, a subtle hint of smugness escaping into his expression."Oh, trying that card, are you?Well, you see, I admire your achievement.Really, I do.But Fate dictates that today, at 8:53 P.M., you are to pass into the afterlife."The doctor opened his mouth to protest, but a single gesture from Vellaunus silenced him."You see, normally I would let this one slide.Every few centuries there's one of you that discovers some viable path to immortality, but they're few and far between and they usually deal with themselves more or less on schedule.""But you arrived at your destination by a particularly unsavory route.A deal with the devil, hmm?He never grants immortality, but you exploited a technicality in a way I wouldn't have thought to do, and I respect that.""Unfortunately, your patron demands an immediate return on his investment.And we're not above using a few technicalities to clean up cases such as these ourselves."Ambrose backed up a step, finding himself leaning backwards on one of the workbenches.He felt a shadow looming over him."But I'm immortal!I can't go to the afterlife if I can't die!"He spat out the words with more courage than he had.Vellaunus softly shook his head, his expression worryingly grim.He began walking over to Ambrose."Oh, Ambrose.I don't care.Your body, your mind, they can stay here as long as you want.But your soul..."

At once, he felt a dark force envelop him.He saw Vellaunus' hand enter his body, passing through his skin as if it were thin air.He pulled something out, a gray wisp, and held it up for the doctor to see as Ambrose collapsed on the ground.He felt empty."Your soul is mine."Ambrose weakly reached up, watching with what felt like his last dregs of humanity as the gray mist exploded in a ball of fire.Vellaunus grinned a smug, wicked smile."One soul, delivered on schedule.You know, a human can live without a soul, but I wouldn't suggest it."Ambrose tried to stand, his vision swimming.The emptiness in him was like the most immeasurable pain he had ever experienced.He watched weakly as Vellaunus switched off the light."If you ever want it back, Dr. Ambyth, you know where to find it."With a final nod, the man closed the door behind him, leaving Ambrose in darkness.
