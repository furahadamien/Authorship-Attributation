"So?Am I losing my mind?Have I already?"Mo kept staring out the window, chewing slowly.I look down at my hands grasping an empty mug.Shaking.When I raise my head again, Mo is looking at me.Or through me.It's hard to tell.He pops another pickle in his mouth and turns back to the window."Well?"I say.He slowly removes his glasses and puts them beside his own mug."Barry.You know I love you right?"he says."Yes.Yes I know, and I love you too," I reply with an exasperated sigh."Alright then.Here's how it is..."

He stands up and beckons me to follow him.As we walk out into the hallway he starts talking.He tells me he won't make the same mistake he's made so many times before.To trust me when chances are it's just another prank, or just another fanciful story I've concocted to piss him off.He stops when we get to the foyer.Points at the door."Barry.As far as I can tell, there are two outcomes to this scenario."He puts his finger on the tip of my nose."One.Like the gullible fuck I am, I'll take your word for it and try to help you out."He points another finger at me."Two, I assume this is just another intricate ploy you've planned to fuck with me."He rubs his stubbled chin for a little while, and finally shakes his head and sighs."I'm still on the fence, so why don't you go back to the club, and if you're still crazy tomorrow, you give me a call and maybe a good nights sleep will have changed my mind one direction or the other."As he walks away the number 44 hangs above his bobbing head.I take the train back to work, sitting with my head in my hands.Across the aisle a man in what appears to be an expensive suit is mumbling to himself and rocking back and forth.I glance up at him and note the number 33.Although I feel like I'm losing my shit, I have the mental acuity to notice that the window behind him reflects the back of his head, but not the number.As I look back down, he speaks in a trembling voice."He is coming."There's no one else around.Is he talking to me?His rocking intensifies, and he starts to hum."HE IS COMING", he suddenly screams and slumps back down in his seat.I jump up and try to shake him awake.After a couple of seconds he comes to, and looks at me with a confused expression."Ehhm..hello?", he says.I tell him he started screaming and passed out, and ask what he remembers.He seems to have no recollection of anything happening and has no idea who he had been talking about.He gets off at the next stop.As the train starts chugging along my eyes find his on the other side of the window.He grins a wicked grin and mouths the words 'I'm here'.The numbers above his head dwindle into nothingness and are slowly replaced by others.Too many others.
