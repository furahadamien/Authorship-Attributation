Jon was having a dream.Even at 30, he still had dreams about college.Most of those dreams were like the one he was having now, dreams about taking a test in a class he had forgotten he
d signed up for, but suddenly had to pass to graduate.This dream came about once a year, and after waking up, Jon wouldn't remember the details, fading as they always do with the fancies of the unconscious mind, but the raw emotion of the thing.Anxiety.BZZZZ zzzzzz

Jon's eyes snapped open in his pitch black room.BZZZZ zzzzz went his phone a second time.Motherfucking Facebook, he thought to himself, as he groggily leaned to his left to figure out what pointless notification has interrupted the same test anxiety dream he had been escaping into for around 9 years now.Through blurry eyes, he saw instead a text notification, a 10 digit number from his hometown.-It's a beautiful night tonight.Look outside.-

Get fucked, he thought, and pulled his thumb across the screen, using the minimum of his nearly unconscious brain to punch in his 4 digit passcode.The white text box made him wince, and as his one open eye adjusted, he managed to send

-Wrong nubmer I thnk, it's 3am idc abuot the moon k bye-

Jon clicked the phone off, dropped in back down onto his coffee table, and rolled back

BZZZZ zzzz

Dude, said Jon, this time aloud, irritation clearing out the cobwebs of his recent unconsciousness.He rolled back over and saw the reply.-It's a beautiful night tonight.Look outside.-

Seriously?  this time his brain went to the next logical point of reference.-Who is this?-

-It's a beautiful night tonight.Look outside.-

-It's the middle of the night, I have to be at work in 5 hours, I don't care about-

-It's a beautiful night tonight.Look outside.-

This time he didn't even finish his response before the reply came.What the fuck...?

Jon, who kept black shutters, became peripherally aware that the light coming from outside was maybe slightly brighter than usual.He racked his brain to think about where the moon cycle was, or when he last had checked the moon at night, as he pulled the phone off the charger and flipped on the bathroom light.BZZZZ zzzz came another two notifications as he sat to pee, closing his eyes against the fluorescent light of the half bath in his upstairs 1 bedroom.As he released his bladder, he picked the phone back up off the vanity, deleted his previous draft, and sent

-IDK if this is a joke but not cool dude, if you know me you know I have insomnia, I'll be up all night because of this now-

-It's a beautiful night tonight.Look outside.-

Jon pressed the number at the top of the phone, scrolled down and thumbed Block this Caller, the top of the screen once again obscured by the repeated message as he did so.Spammers and getting a little avant gard this year, he thought as he shook off the drops and flushed.He casually opened Youtube, and wandered back to bed as he scrolled through his recommended.As he flopped back down onto the twin, he stopped scrolling.Every video was the same.A jpeg of a full moon, descriptions in all caps

IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT TONIGHT.LOOK OUTSIDE.The anxiety of the dream, which had been receding from the back of his mind for the last 4 minutes, now vacated his mind like a water down a drain.What replaced it was a whimsical combination of fear and panic.He checked trending videos.They were all the same, in Kanji, in Arabic, in Mandarin.He recognized korean characters, some of the subject lines had characters he didn't recognize.One video, bafflingly, had characters in multiple sizes

Is that even possible on mobile?BZZZZ zzzz

Jon yelped and recoiled from the phone, dropping it onto the off white carpet he had been planning on having cleaned this weekend by a professional who could deal with the stains left behind by two years of careless habits when it came to falling asleep while eating.The phone bounced once off the corner of it's black rubber case and landed face down.BZZZZ zzzz ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

the notifications turned the normally harmless and sedate phone of a quiet, single introvert into a bee hive, then a chainsaw.Jon, who had moments ago been fast asleep, was now bolt upright in his bed, leaning against the back wall of his tiny bedroom, and consciously trying to fight what felt like an inevitable panic attack, something that he hadn't experienced since the age of 16, an embarrassing incident that resurfaced in his mind with spectacular clarity.The phone fell silent.Jon, stock still and hyperventilating, fought a wave of nausea and forced himself to focus on his heart rate, then his breathing.A few sobering breaths later, he calmly stood up, took a step, and crouched down, picking up the object that had become his communicator, his entertainment, his to do list, and his morning wake up call for the last 8 years.It was dead from a full charge, and hot to the touch through the case.From the outline of light from the hallway beyond the closed bedroom door, he thought he could see it smoking.Dylan Francis, Jon thought to himself.He remembered an interview, or maybe just a video on Wired, where Dylan Francis recalled the time when DJ Snake gave out his phone number during a show, and how the notifications had bricked his battery in a matter of seconds.Without bothering to plug it back in, Jon stood up and opened the door from his bedroom, went down the short hallway to the living room, and opened his laptop.After entering another passcode, the blank desktop he used mostly for gaming popped open, and he moused open Firefox.The google homepage popped up, and Jon swiped up to the 9 black boxes, clicked on it, then down to News.The top stories were all the same.From the New York times, Vox, NPR, Al Jazeera, BBC, every single link he scrolled past was identical.He gently hit the delete, key, opened the tab again, this time opening his GMail.He had 13,000 emails, from spam accounts, from phone numbers, from websites he subscribed to, all identical.IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT TONIGHT.LOOK OUTSIDE.As the notification bar began to scroll up and the number rose towards 13500, he hurriedly closed the tab, leaned backwards from the bright white screen, and tried to piece together what the fuck was going on.Cyber attack, he thought, it's not just me, it's some kind of DDOS, the Russians are taking down the internet.It made sense, but then why the specific message?Some kind of code?The corner of Jon's right eye caught a glimpse of light, coming through the blinds of the second story balcony.He leaned slightly to his right, and through a missing slat he had put off replacing for the last year and a half, he saw the last thing he would ever be aware of.A single tear rolled down his face as he stood, unblinking, walked towards the balcony door, and opened the shutter.Another tear followed the first, this one red from the broken blood vessels that collapsed as he turned his blind eyes towards the moon.The tear became a stream, flowing from both corners of both eyes, and what was left of Jon's conscious mind screamed as his brain began to implode.Jon's phone blinked to life, facedown on his carpet.A single notification popped onto the screen, the triangular warning familiar to all iPhone users in metropolitan areas- an Amber Alert.-DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON- -DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON- -DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON- -DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON- -DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON- -DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON- -DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON- -DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON- DO NOT
