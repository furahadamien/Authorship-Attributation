TedwardoDaVinci
A dishevelled figure stood alone in the middle of the road, rocking backwards and forwards and whimpering softy.Cradled in his hands was the rotting carcass of a mutilated pigeon.Wet brown entrails dangled from its stomach, and in its partially detatched head a sliver of brain was becoming visible.'Rom!I think Hedwig's ignoring me,' Harry gurgled, stumbling around in search of his friend.'Rom!Where are you?'He roared, vigorously shaking the carcass.At this final piece of abuse, the stringy sinews at the top of its neck were pulled out, and Hedwig's decapitated head was catapulted across the street into the window of no 4 Privet drive.It landed with a splat, lingering there for a moment before beginning its slippery descent down onto the pavement below.'Repairo', Harry said thickly, to what remained of Hedwig.Suddenly disinterested, he dumped her to the floor.At this, a fat ginger man galumphed out of a nearby alleyway, gripping a piece of scaffolding tightly between his legs.'Hi, Harry.I was looking for the snitch', he said happily.tbc
