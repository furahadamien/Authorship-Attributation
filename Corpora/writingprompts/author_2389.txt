Veedrac
A flash of white.The room was sparse and wooden, expansive and expensive.There was no furniture but a polite looking table circled with three old fashioned chairs.And then there was a tap on the shoulder, and Samuel jumped.Behind him stood an old man, face lined with faint wisps of white.His shoulders drooped low, but his face exuded an aura of hospitality.A metre back stood a woman maybe thirty of age and with a models figure, but unnaturally tall.The man tapped again and gestured to the table.He spoke slowly through a heavy, nameless accent.Please sit.

Samuel looked over to the table and back.I would rather stand. He scanned the room for the door, distant but accessible.Who are you?This isnt private property, I hope?

The elder male thought for a second before turning to the woman.She articulated strongly in an artificial, but fluent, speech.It is preferable to sit.You should rather sit. She too gestured to the table.Samuel was not here for a strange old man and a tall lady.He was looking for a Kane Lawson, a cranky immortal who would never look a day past thirty five.A man who spoke in bitter tones of the world he pillaged, as if the debt he owed what owed to him, and was conspicuously absent from this impromptu meeting.Samuel, its me.Kane Lawson. The old mans eyes watered, a wavering voice worsening the already impenetrable accent.I have waited so long.You must know who I am.

> Dear Samuel,

> If I spoke unduly to you last evening I must profess my regret.I certainly meant no harm to your standing nor any offense to your intellect.My words were intended not for you, but for your students.Had I left you to continue claim that time is a measure or to push your innovative system of equations the poor pupils may have just accepted it.Until the first true experimental results arrive  and I expect my research to bring that soon  ideas like yours must be understood as the unevidenced hypotheses they are.>
> One thing I am sure we must both agree on is that Time, like all other fundamental properties, is conserved.It is not a measure but a quantity.You can no more easily destroy time than you can wring it from a rock.Surely you must be aware that your thoughts violate these most evident of principles.>
> One can only demand as much respect as they are prepared to give out, so I caution you not to further disrespect the rising foundation of Horology.Good men state only the truth, regardless of how ready they are to hear it.Should you not come to appreciate this, my only comfort is knowing that whilst you may have tenured before me, I shall be the faster to a Nobel Prize.>
> Yours sincerely,

The first time traveller was dead.She just apparated from the past to precisely that room she had left behind a ten and a few years ago.Kane Lawson never once believed in magic, yet had he been a metre closer it would have slapped him on the face.First the timeline switched.A great sphere of the past, enveloping her, scraping away a circle of the floor below, traded places with the sphere before, misaligned slightly from improperly compensated continental drift.Then the photons realized, subsuming the new reality in but an instant.And the time traveller was drowned in a new background of wifi and radio, a thousand conversations from a time she had never known.The room became heavier, the new dragging the room ever so slightly further down the gravitational well.Far slower, the pressure normalized, a deep and powerful clap as two differently heated bodies redistributed their mass.Then they noticed.In but an eighth of a second Eves overloaded senses reached her brain and propagated innate reflexes to every inch of her being.Milliseconds later the professor followed, becoming cognizant of his sensory overload and the thundering that filled his ears.But only the professor truly experienced the next few seconds, as a vessel emptied of time was flooded.As she aged, expressionless, unable to gasp or feel or grasp, as her smooth skin mottled and tightened to her bones, her hair grayed and fell out, and her eyes clouded and creased.She hunched and distorted, the colour draining from her as she as whitened, a ghostly silhouette atrophying in a torrent of time.From her sang an applause of cracks as her bones brittled and snapped, and an inhuman cancer devoured what remained from her breast, feeding from the influx of time.Finally she fell, and her skin fell away too, leaving but disease and bones.And she died on her circle, the past she never escaped.---

How dare you?How fucking dare you?

I can not tell you how, but I can tell you why. Professor Lawson stepped around Eves lifeless remains, clothes decades too young for her constricting her motionless chest.Samuel, this is the proof.No system is closed.Time is a thing  a thing you can hold, a thing you can shape.These forty odd lives are the means beyond our ends.You should have realised it the moment Eve fell at my feet four years ago.

Theyre dead.Everyones dead.

Look at her, Samuel.She hasnt aged a day since you saw her last.Not even a singular cell will grow on her bones.Theyve thrown her in a box and prodded her with needles.What good will that do?Its time, Samuel.

Step back or I swear to God...

Its too late.Forty lots of forty years.Even accounting for loss, Im already immortal.That wasnt the goal, obviously, I just need to spend it  use it to do what Eve could not.

Professor Lawson took a deep breath and unclipped what looked like a brass multimeter from belt.In the centre was a large, black plastic rotary dial, its notches labelled by a scrawling red marker of incomprehensible symbols on the metal embedding it.The top of the device held an eight segment display showing a single dim number, flickering values around zero.The back of the device was open, spewing a whorl of wire guts and tape onto the professors hand.This device could have changed everything back in 2024.How old does that make it now?

Eighteen.

No!Thats just it  it jumped.It has eighteen years of time but only six are its own.Its a cage of anothers time.As I am a cage for theirs. He gestured around at the bodies in the room.They aged just like when she arrived to me.I have taken their time.

The professor turned the dial a notch, checked a few wires.A sudden boom shook the room and the professor was gone.In his place stood a second Samuel Maxwell.
