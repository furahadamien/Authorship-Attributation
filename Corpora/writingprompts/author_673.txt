I was one of the first batches to receive the drug.They called it Immortelixir - just two shots of pale blue liquid as clear as the summer sky.There were.. minor side effects; they warned.Delayed reproduction, vulnerability to certain - curable - diseases, increased appetite as you age.Yadda yadda yadda.We stopped listening to the pre-inoculation seminar after a while.All of it seemed like a fair trade to anyone who had half a brain, so we took it, almost everyone did, even the oldies.Its been 15 years since we got the vaccine.Life has been excellent.I was 25 when I had my shots and I feel exactly the same.I run 2 miles a day, go boxing from time to time and make sure to keep my young body in tiptop shape.No use wasting a gift given, right?Im lucky my wife - Elena - feels the same because thats how we met, at a full marathon.Boy that woman can run!She still runs from time to time, but shes full term and she took a break from running a few months back to make sure everything goes well once the baby comes.Weve always talked about how we wish our parents could see our baby, Margaret, when she arrives but they werent so lucky.The drug does stop ageing, but it still couldnt stop people from getting sick.Her dad died from cancer, that man smoked like a yardside barbecue during Super Bowl.Her mom died from MS, it was slow and painful for both of them.My parents, on the other hand, also both passed away within a year of each other.My father has always been hypertensive and has already had open heart surgery so it came as no surprise that he had a major heart attack and died on the spot.It didnt make it less painful, but no, it wasnt much of a suprise.10 months later, my mom succumbed to rare and agressive form of blood poison.They tried their best to prolong her life, but there simply wasnt enough knowledge about this new disease.Its been a while since they died and Elena and I waited until it felt right to have a baby, after all, we had all the time in the world to prepare.Apparently, our timing was just right because as they warned, everyone who got the vaccine got pregnant pretty late, like, almost all of the ones around our age just started getting pregnant.Social media is all alit by baby showers and gender reveals, it almost feels like it was a global community of people celebrating the same milestones.I heard from her Ob-gyne that we might be one of the first vaccinated couples to have a baby.Our baby will be a pioneer!The first immortal baby!My heart is thumping at the thought of it.I can barely sit still at the waiting room lobby.There were five of us expectant dads - for some reason, they only allowed the husbands in the waiting room, no one else.Within a few hours of each other we will be the five pioneer dads- the first dads of our kind.We exchanged names and minor chitchat, but we mostly kept to ourselves.My blood was humming with energy.Its been four hours but I was still on the edge, there were only two of us left.Mr.Fowler! The man on my right, Joshua, sprang to his feet and shuffled quickly to the nurse before they disappeared through the doors.Mr.Lindeberg! My heart skipped a bit and I ran as fast as my legs could carry me.Margaret was here!We walked briskly to the operating room where my wife was and stopped.All eyes were on me.All of them were looking at me like zombies.A cold sweat crept through the back of my neck like a ghost as I saw my wife on the table.She was pale, almost bluish.Her eyes were closed, her lips bloodless.It cant be.. 

What... happened? I heard my choked voice like it came from someone else.Im sorry Mr. Lindeberg.., we did what we could but.. a man in green scrubs said slowly, his hands on his side, clenching and unclenching.I went to my wifes side and took her cold hand in mine.It was like marble, cold and smooth and lifeless.My heart thundered an irregular beat but I refused to believe it.Why were they playing this cruel prank on me?I dont believe it.What a stupid game to play.No... it cant.. NO.I refuse to believe it.And Margaret, where is she?! He looked at me desperately, like he wanted to run but couldnt.Shes in the incubator in the nursery.Shes doing fine. A nurse said, putting my arm gently on my shoulders as she led me gently out the room.I felt numb and cold.I could not process this.It was all a blur, one foot in front of the other, suddenly I was standing outside of the nursery, looking at five little incubators side by side.The other four were there too, standing in front of the glass, silent.I took my place as the nurse quietly pointed to the incubator to my right at the end of their little procession and craned my neck as she said Theres your baby, Mr. Lindeberg.

And then I knew why they were all so quiet..The babies were..  different.They were small and deformed, with large misshapen heads and short limbs.Some fingers were missing.Their eyes were a pair of large and small and dark colored, like they were all pupils and irises.They wheezed and sniffled and gasped.They were all the same.All of them.Later I found out that all their mothers had died.All five our proud pioneer wives had died on the table.We werent exactly immortal after all.We couldnt reproduce because our women died at childbirth producing a generation of deformed and infirm children, and we still got sick and died from diseases, accidents, acts of God.. 

Our desire for immortality may have just killed off our species.
