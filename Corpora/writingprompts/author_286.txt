Delilah hung up her jacket and took off her shoes.Another dud date.This one was cute.Almost as though he was made to be her type.Tall, dark hair, subtly muscular.And only one dimple.He checked off all the boxes too.He worked as an EMT, bleeding heart type.He liked classic rock and k-pop.Game of Thrones and Gilmore Girls were his go to TV shows (what were the odds of that one).But when they had kissed at the end of the date it just felt flat.No fireworks.Delilah had been through swaths of men and none of them compared to that first love.The one that got away.&nbsp;
She put her curly brown hair into a ponytail and took out her contacts.She sighed after putting on her arm flannel pajamas.She shaved her legs for nothing.Again.How many had she gone through now?Twenty?She had been using online dating most recently.There were a lot of good options, firemen, doctors, professional athletes.But they all felt so fake.Like they were trying to be something they werent.&nbsp;
When she had first met Emmet she wasnt interested at first.She didnt usually go for small waifs like him.He had freckles like her and not even one dimple.Not to mention his wild red hair.But when they started to speak at a mutual friends party it just clicked.She felt like she could speak to him forever.Sure he hated Gilmore Girls and worked as an accountant for a faceless corporation, but he was kind and when he touched her hair.Fireworks.They dated for eight months.And for those months she was truly happy.They would play punch buggy or watch a movie just to make fun of it.They just fit.But one day, Emmet said he couldnt do it anymore.She never fully understood why he was breaking up with her.He said something about meeting other people and being physically compatible.But she had always been attracted to him.So maybe he just wasnt into her.No fireworks.&nbsp;
As Delilah watched TV she thought of the string of men that had followed.First there was Bruce, the hottie at the gym.She had given him the side eye even when she was with Emmet.He asked her out not even two days after her break up.It was like he knew she was freshly single.At first she said no; she was in too much pain.But a rebound friend with benefits situation did help.For a short while at least.And while he was hot and very good in bed, he felt fake.No fireworks.&nbsp;
She had dated the doctor for three months.He worked in pediatrics so of course she had to give him a try.But even though she wanted so badly to fall in love him, she soon realized she didnt.Then there was the cook, the rocker, the one covered in tattoos, the one without any tattoos at all.Sometimes they went on a couple dates, sometimes more.But she had gotten almost good and sliding out of their lives when she realized that spark wasnt there.Or that she wasnt over Emmet.Sometimes one of them would bite his lip like Emmet did.Or she would see freckles on his cheeks for just a moment.Or their laugh would get shrill like his always did.Sometimes she felt like she saw him in every one of them.But they werent him.So they werent good enough.&nbsp;
Delilah sighed and looked over to her phone lying next to her on her couch.She wished she still had Emmets number, but he had changed it long ago.It was like he had completely disappeared.Maybe she would see him again one day.&nbsp;

Emmet shifted back from tall and burly to his natural size as soon as he reached his apartment.This version had not worked either.He thought Delilah liked buff men.And he mentioned every favorite song and TV show he could without raising suspicion.But he could tell from the look in her eyes that she wouldnt call this one back.What was he doing wrong?He brushed his fingers through his red hair and bit his lip.He would win Delilahs heart again.But how?&nbsp;
