The abyss was black and endless and I stared into it without blinking.The smell of ash and burned hair filled my nostrils as I sucked in the smoke descending from the heavens.I felt a hand on my shoulder and turned to see a stoop-shouldered man with a long mustache, peppered with grey.His eyes alone told me who he was, and I marveled that he had managed to survive the Philosophical purge."You said this would happen," I said."You said it would."I was aware that his hand was still on my shoulder, his gaze still fixed at my lowered eyes, now filling with tears and existential rage.But I didn't care.I didn't care if he saw me cry.Not now.Not after everything that had happened and everything that still was and still would.Over and over again."And now it's all gone.Philosopher versus philosopher, heretics versus heretics.We destroyed it all.And for what?To know our selves? "I knew he probably didnt understand english and I didnt understand german.But we understood pain.He and I.And the rest of the world.We all understood pain now.And we knew it."What was it all for Nietzsche?"And as I spoke those words I felt it- a warm runny liquid on my foot.It wasn't Nietzsche.It was Diogenes.&#x200B;
