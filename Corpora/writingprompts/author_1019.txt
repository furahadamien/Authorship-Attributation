Seventeen is a magical age.Sure you can't drink or even buy cigarettes, but as far as I'm concerned, it's the best age.I got my first car at 17 (a used Taurus).My first relationship started and ended when I was 17 (a brand new Sara).And I was 17 when my Oreo and fluffernutter pie won the Nabisco Oreo Baking Challenge.I made the crust with ground up Oreo and made the filling with peanut butter, marshmallow fluff, and cream.It was a cavity in a bowl and it won me a lifetime supply of my favorite cookie.I received my first package of my lifetime supply about the same time that I first heard the word "caldera."It sounded like some wannabe metal band.I changed the channel.A few weeks later I turned 18 and the sun went away.I miss the sun.I don't miss being 18.&#x200B;

Now I'm staring down my 48th birthday having spent the past three decades living off of Oreos.Every month, I wake up and find a package of 36 cookies next to me.The packaging hasn't changed in years.It still says "Milk's favorite cookie!"which seems a bit cruel in a world without milk.In any case, I'm lucky to have them.At first I split up the cookies with my family.After my parents and Carly were killed, I marked my 19th birthday by eating the entire pack in one sitting.Eventually I put together an existence of sorts in Shenandoah National Park.I built a respectable hovel and even made a mailbox out of  balsam fir.Every month, I'd check the mail for my Oreos.&#x200B;

Over time, more people joined me, building their own hovels next to mine in a community.I wish I could tell you they joined because of my charisma or my building skills.But that would be a lie.All seven of my neighbors joined when they learned about my Oreos.You see, spending years and years without any sugar makes you crave it so much that it becomes more valuable than gold.Sure you can forage for wild strawberries, but there's no substitute for the real thing.Every month, each of us got four Oreos.We would have gotten 4.5, except one of my neighbors used to be a priest and made us use the rest for communion.I was the king of my own mini-empire.For the first time since the lights went out, I was happy.&#x200B;

That was until I kicked out of my own paradise.Why did my neighbors turn on me so?It turns out you can't eat hundreds of cookies and not brush your teeth without getting a few cavities.And gingivitis and tooth decay aren't pretty in a post-apocalyptic world.They blamed me and I had to get out of dodge in a hurry.Now I don't eat any more Oreos, I use then as currency when I need to barter.Maybe I'll eat a few for my birthday next month.I'll be 48.If I can find a candle, I'll be wishing I was 17 again.
