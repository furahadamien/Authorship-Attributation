"NEIN!NEIN!NEIN!Nein!"the goofy mustached man screamed, but he got a compromising glare from the other red haired man at his own easel.Adolf breathed in heavily looking at the man frustrated but relaxing in increments paint dripping from his brush."You remember our discussion...good for you, you can count in your head or out loud.Either way this is how you get back to your happy place."Bob told him as he watched the tension ease."Eight, seven, six, fiven, four...skipping to mein happly place, three, two one."Adolf's face slowly lost it's flush and his breathing steadied."Heinrich, buddy, maybe if you offered the shepard there a little gift he would not be so fidgetty."Bob suggested the handler as the dog insisted to stand up and wag it's tail, which is clearly what set Adolf off."I apologize for my outburst Heinrich, it's just zeez heathen's and Yosef are destroying my creativity.How can I paint my heart's desires when they are tainted by impure imagery of our homeland being willingly invaded right under our noses?"Adolf asked no one in particular.Heinrich pulled out a piece of salted pork and the dog did calm down."You know, I've always been of the mind that purity is an individual concept, like money or time."Bob offered."How so?"Adolf asked immediately."Well if you did not know money or time existed at all, would they still be relevant in your daily life?"Bob replied giggling as he whacked his brush after cleaning it in the acetone.Adolf laughed as well but Bob had gotten used to the alarming shriek that was Mr.Hitler's odd laugh."So you are saying zat, purity is an internal concept?Most intriguing."Adolf remarked as August walked in to the studio."Fellas'."August greeted sitting on the couch."August, Mr.Ross believes purity is an individual concept.Would you agree with zis' statement?"Adolf asked him continuing his outline of the shepherd."Yeh, seems about right.After all it is like saying of old...uh beauty is in ze' eye of ze' beholder?"August said."What a great analogy August.Good for you."Bob remarked watching Adolf's belief system change before his eyes.Bob hoped that his original timeline would remain intact like professor Hawking suggested.He had three more months to infuse Adolf's personality with as much good as possible and it was not easy at first.The tiniest things could trigger Adolf's anger but like a piece of fine marble Bob was chipping away at it and Adolf's paintings had improved as well."Bob could you show me zat' trick you do with ze' knife again?It's brilliant, but I fear zat' I put too much paint on and make mistake."Adolf asked.Bob's heart swelled as he knew the exact reply that would give Adolf the confidence to overcome the obstacle of a mistake.
