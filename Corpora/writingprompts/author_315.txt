I rub my eyes and slowly take in my surroundings.It's ridiculously silent, the kind of silence which feels like dusk on a moonless night on a hot and dry day where the dry warm winds finally relent and almost out of mercy settle down for the night in the arid and deserted plains.I do not know this place but I do remember falling asleep on this chair, I recall the maroon cushion on it, they reminded me of the little grand chair I had growing up.I miss being a child, waking up on a chilly day around the end of the year during the winter break, sleeping in late and getting hot cocoa with the usual eggs and toast with too much ketchup; yes those were the days.I keep slipping in and out of sleep, dazed and almost drugged.The white marble with the white lights reflected in them don't hurt my eyes but feel pleasant.I am not sure if it's morning yet.I don't feel like waking up just now and inquiring where I am.I am sure I'll still be here when I wake up.The distant sound of seagulls, white sands and the incessant surf that builds up only to make its existence heard and then retreat.I have sand on my feet, I don't mind.Nor do I feel like opening my eyes.I'm too drowsy to do that.The weight of my head is curiously apparent right now.My arm hurts. 
"You're going to feel light headed before you start feeling normal again."Says the voice, which sounds familiar, instructional yet empathetic."I've given him another shot to wane the pain, but it's slightly lighter so he's going to feel some discomfort.And one more thing," I feel them take a few steps away and the voice turns to a whisper, almost cautioning and raising concern though I cannot make out what's been said.I feel the waves take over me again.The light floods in from all sides, white marble floor and the hum of the source of the light.All enveloping.
