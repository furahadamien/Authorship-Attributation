The Lord found Satan in Georgia.He was lookin' for a shoulder to cry.He was in a bind ', pride made him blind.He made a supid deal.He came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot.And the lord jumped in right there and said "satan, let me tell you what.""I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too.And if you don't care ill take his dare I'll make a bet with you.Now he plays a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the lord his due.I'll bet a new fiddle of gold against your souls 'cause I think I'm better than you."The lord said, "You must be Johnny, and it surely is a sin,
But take my bet; and you're gonna regret 'cause I'm the best there's ever been."Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard.'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the lord has all the cards.And if you win you get two shiny fiddles made of gold,
But if you lose the lord gets both your souls.The lord opened up his case and he said, "I'll start this show."And sparks flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow.And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made Johnny hiss.And a band of angels joined in and it sounded something like this.When the good lord finished, Johnny said, "Well, you're pretty good ol' son,
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.""Fire on the Mountain."Run, boys, run!The God is in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough.Granny, does your dog bite?No, child, no.The good lord bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet.Johnny said, "Boys just come on back.If you ever wanna try again,
I done told you bothyou sons of a bitchI'm the best that's ever been."And he played:

"Fire on the Mountain."Run, boys, run!The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
The chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough.Granny, will your dog bite?No, child, no.
