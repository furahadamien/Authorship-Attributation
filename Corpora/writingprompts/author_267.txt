As the power within grew.As more and more were killed.we were still no match for them.the handful that remained decided there must only be one.one person who had domain over the entirety of the power one would be able to stop them.it would mean the end of the human race but they would not get our planet.the people took their life and the one gained the the power.the one went forth but there was no resistance all around they just keeled.Upon reaching the main ship the doors were open inviting the one inside.when the throne came into view the one fell to the ground and cried.sitting on the throne was not an alien but a human.a human with its own power from another world the entire invasion force was all human each the last of their worlds.do not cry said the ruler you are home now.i know im terrible with grammar sorry just had to get this out
