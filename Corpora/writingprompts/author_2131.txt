Jack got out of the car but the body was so badly damaged it was impossible to even tell whether it was once a human or not.The strange message really threw him off his comfort."Ok now, where is the hidden camera?Which game show am I on?"*You are not in a game show.You are the 12th participant in the JackJack Experiment.You have 48 hours to identify and terminate at least one other Jack.*

"So I'm either in a great show or I'm having the best trip of my life.Still, I'm glad I haven't killed anyone.HEY!Whatever you are, what if I don't want 'kill' any more Jacks?"*You are the 12th participant in this experiment.Statistically speaking your species should contain enough intelligent individuals to realize what this means.*

"You've got to be kidding" He started to panic "How dense you have to be to force people to murder each other for nothing?!?"*It is not for nothing; you now have everything you need to know about his trade.1017kg/m3 converted.Why is this information relevant to your task?*

"That's not what I meant.... Well whatever it was fun, I'll watch this and laugh at myself on the web.See ya around."*You are not permitted to leave*

"You dense fucker, you said 48 hours.At least count them all."*Failing your task will result in your termination in a specific way your predecessors called 'cruel and painful'*

"Well then, what if I kill myself?Then you cannot force me to do anything and I won't be in pain."The world shifted, suddenly he was in space watching the globe revolve.The lights of the dark globe were shining.It truly would have been beautiful sight, but he was truly in space.The air rushed out of his lungs creating severe pain, he felt immense cold and heat at the same time.He lost his vision shortly after he was somehow teleported.Jack couldn't decide what was worse; the suffocation or the cold boiling of his own blood.Before everything went dark, he thought to himself:

"I will do it!"...He woke up in his truck in a parking lot next to a gas station.He still had headache and a weird dream."Whatever booze I drunk last night, I'll probably never do it again."*It was not a dream, Jack.You have 37 hours and 11 minutes left of your assignment*

"Ah come on now!It is impossible to find another Jack within this time frame."There was no answer for quite a while

"Fuck you then."He was also very hungry so decided to pick up a Hot Dog inside the gas station."Inside the station was empty, only a sleepy clerk was at the cash register.Without him looking at Jack, as if automated, the clerk said:

"Welcome to the Fill-It-Up station sir.""I'd like two Hot Dogs with all sauces."Without bothering to answer, the clerk went to the wiener roller machine and started to prepare them.Welder, and now also Plumber Jack roamed the store to find any magazines where maybe someone offered gay sex.Who knew, maybe he could call them and ask for their names, then kill them.It was a poor idea but he didn't have any better ones."Your Hot Dogs are ready, sir."Jack brought the gay magazine to the register with a ton of embarrassment.When he got the Hot Dogs, he glanced at the name plate of the clerk: Jack.Holly fucking fuck, he thought as he went out to his truck.He wasn't hungry anymore, so he packed the food into the trunk, then he just sat there.Finally, a lousy idea came.He popped open the hood to disconnect the battery, then went back to the building."Excuse me, could you please help me with my car?It won't start...."

"I am sorry; I can't help you.""Please, I really need to get going.Would you help me for hundred bucks?"The clerk looked at the cameras, then reached for under the counter.After he turned off the cameras, he went outside with Jack.Jack opened the hood for the clerk to look inside.Right when the clerk leaned inside, Jack grabbed the hood and pulled down as fast as he could.There was a wet snap, a disgusting sound then a message finally appeared:

*You successfully killed another Jack within the given time-frame.Your new unlocked skill is: Infinite patience.*

"That's ok."

*Your timer for the next assignment refreshed.You have 48 hours to identify and terminate at least one other Jack.*

"All right.I would like to ask you something...."

*Granted*

"More like a proposal.You either give me more time search and destroy or you help me find new ones.I don't care what you choose, just choose one."*We will help you identify the next one.*

"Cool.Where is he and what skill does he have?"*He is inside a small gym few miles down the road.His skill is close quarters combat.*
