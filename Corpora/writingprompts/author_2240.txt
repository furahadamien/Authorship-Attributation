**Journeys End**

Tomorrow we reach it.Garrix says that well find the root to all existence, that purpose itself will have an answer, like all equations.I stopped listening to Garrix a long time ago.Officer Mercurier hasnt stopped pacing the entire journey, her performance has declined significantly.If anyone should be concerned with roots it would be her, she was the heir to a family who extended all the way back to the diaspora.I chose my team carefully.The pair are barely fit to the task but they are a lesser evil.Choosing someone from one of the high families could be construed as an act of war, and I will not suffer one of the tech-speakers aboard this ship.In my hand was the last coherent reading from the planet.&#x200B;

*:We Were Human:*

&#x200B;

The archaic term for the origin species.The spacial trail ends here, the trail of death that many seekers died following.The first and last time a worm drive was activated.A scar on the fabric of reality.What will we find.Will the worm trail be a testament to ambition?Cowardice?Failure?Ignorance?Tomorrow we reach it, the end.I hope so anyway.My X-HUNTER was a standard military ship a hundred years ago.Now its a relic thats held together with TLC and sheer will.As I walked past Garrixs quarters I found myself stroking the insignia plate.*Unit: D3LI14.*

Delila I whispered to the groaning metal.My hand touched the plate with a reverence and tenderness thats reserved for the overly attached and very lonely.Cap? a groggy voice called through pincers Arrived have we? Garrixs chitin grated against the metal as he worked his way from the bed, pincers clicking all the while.The door would have been a sliding door, opening at the presence of the inhabitants and asking for clarification if anyone outside wanted in, but this was Delila.Garrix pushed aside the hanging beads.His soft beige chitin shining with the morning orange from the ships lights.His antennae whipped back and forth I cant honestly say Ive ever been this excited His shell parted slightly, revealing the almost human face beneath.No mouth, no nose, but beautiful blue eyes that held more life than Id ever felt.Just hope theres still anything left of the place I said my cynicism topping my own excitement Might be a wasteland his shoulders slumped but then he looked at my face.He saw the excitement I felt, that even beneath the nihilistic haze I was still me.Garrix was one of the last people I knew that I could call friend.He saw through my bullshit.But didnt begrudge it.He had his shell and I had mine.Best get ready, Cap he nodded and went back inside his room.I had begun to walk away when he called back Make one for me too

I giggled to myself as I walked towards the bridge.Hed gone to get dressed and wanted coffee.Someone who cant consume liquid and only wears clothes on special occasions, wanted coffee and wads getting changed.He must be nervous or excited.Probably both.The bridge hummed as the auxiliary systems came to life.Someone had started up Delila without me.: Check My Stuff!
