words-for-blood
I tugged at my sleeves, pulling them up to uncover the rotten skeleton I now am.Once, I was human.I rememeber the day I died quite well.It felt like I was still in the living world, but everything was grey.Dulled.I could touch things, but they wouldn't respond.I wandered my world, watching the living function and continue on without me.Eventually, I felt my pockets and found a small golden coin, brighter than anything else in my dull grey world.As soon as I held it, the nearest door glowed golden.Right as I was about to walk through, I heard a blood curdling scream.I hesitated, staring at the door, then pocketed the coin and ran in the direction of the scream.A young boy, maybe fifteen, had been on the wrong end of the goat he was trying to herd.His mother was curled over him while his breath became raspy, and other young boys chased the goat back towards the rest of the herd and away from the dying boy.I kneeled next to him, watching the blood drip from the corner of his mouth while his mother begged him to live.He looked like he was in so much pain.I didn't know what to do, how to help, but for some reason I reached out and put my hand on his chest.His breathing stopped, and he made what they now call a 'death rattle'.The last air in his lungs escaped, and he stopped moving.As I removed my hand, his chest moved with it.I was confused, but continued to pull away, pulling him with me.Eventually, I stood with the boy in front of me, his bawling mother still curled over his body a foot away.We didn't say anything.He looked back at his family sadly, then at me.I smiled at him gently, and gestured to his pocket.He pulled out the coin, saw the glowing door to the barn nearby, and looked back at me.I waved him over, told him to go."Waiting and watching will provide you with no gift but sorrow and grief."My voice echoed oddly, as though we stood in a giant cave and not out in the middle of a field.He nodded sadly, looked back at his mother once again, and walked away to the barn.&#x200B;

Since then I have wandered, helping the lost find their way.It's always a gold coin, unremarkable but for its glow, and a doorway nearby.The door may not be human made, but made from branches or a fallen tree.Some souls fight me, wanting to make sure their family survives without them, or watching some sort of unfinished business.I always trail along them silently, letting them grieve as they do.Some souls go insane when they watch their family move on without them, and some find peace in it.It is not my business to tell them what to do, I just make sure they get where they need to be.As the years went on, my skin rotted and my hair fell out.My body continued to decompose as it would, but my bones stayed upright.I continued on.I crafted a robe to cover my flesh as it fell, to keep from scaring the people I helped along their way.I learned that one the hard way, when a little girl reached to hold my hand and came away with skin from my finger.It was a struggle to convince her to walk through the doorway after that.Between people, my afterlife was quiet.I couldn't help everyone as the human population boomed, but I helped who I could.As more time went on, I was less sure what was on 'the other side' and more afraid of it.I had control here, I was going to stay here.&#x200B;

I stared at my reflection in the lake, wondering how I could still see with empty sockets, how I could still feel with no skin.I rubbed what was left of my fingers together and the bones clicked as they touched.Lazily, I looked over at the young couple that were paddling across the lake.One of them had light coloured hair, maybe dirty blonde in the real world, and the other's was dark as midnight and fell to the middle of her back.The girl with light hair was slightly glowing golden, a symptom I had noticed in people who were going to cross over soon.I couldn't go in the water, only walk on top, so if she were to drown I would have to convince her soul to climb up and meet me.It was a horrible death, but at least she had me to help her.I walked alongside their boat as they slowed down and pulled out fishing rods.I groaned.Fishing could take hours, and the outline shows anytime from days to hours of death.At the sound of my groan, Light Hair jumped.I forgot that those close to death, close to the line, could hear me or see me if they were lucky.She looked around, but her eyes slid past me.I had to step quickly to not be knocked over by the waves, which kept kicking up as the hours went on.The sky darkened and rumbled.This must be how she dies, I thought.Her girlfriend, Dark Hair, pleaded with Light Hair to take her back to shore, but Light Hair insisted that she was close to catching the big one, she was sure.A crack of lightning made them both scream, and Light Hair conceded it was time to head back to shore.I stared at the sky sadly.Her decision came too late., I was sure.Her glow got brighter the closer they got to shore.I had to jump and dodge around the waves now, as they didn't move with me and it would be very easy for them to knock me away.I made it back to shore before they did, slightly, and saw someone crouching beside their vehicle.This is interesting, I thought.The girls, now drenched from the storm, pulled back onto shore giggling."I can't believe you kept us out in that!"Dark Hair squealed."Yeah, but it was worth it."Light Hair's eyes dragged down Dark Hair's soaked body, her clothes plastered to her.They both laughed again, and went to get the car, to load the boat.I stood beside the crouching gentleman, wondering the story behind what was sure to be an anger fueled murder.I stood as Light Hair got close to me, and by now her glow was bright enough to hurt the eyes I didn't have.She gasped as she saw me, and the crouching man jumped out.He must have assumed she saw him.She screamed, but it quickly turned into a gurgle as his knife plunged into her throat.He stabbed her several more times while Dark Hair screamed.Dark Hair tried to pull the man off, and it seemed like she knew the man."Jonathan!"She kept screaming.An ex lover?An angry family member?I was curious, but more concerned for Light Hair.She wasn't exiting her body on her own.I'd have to help her.I grabbed her hand, and pulled until she stood in front of me.She screamed at the sight of me, then turned and saw the scene I had been watching.She screamed for several minutes, collapsing in front of me before she calmed down.The crouching man stood away from the body, and Dark Hair collapsed over her.He stuttered some sort of apology and took off into the woods.I grabbed Light Hair's hand and pulled her up."What's going on?"Her voice, whlie hoarse, still echoed as they always do in this world."You died.I'm sorry.""Are you.. the grim reaper?"Tear tracks ran down her face, and she sniffled."I suppose that's what humans call me.I go by Abel."Recognition dawned on her face.I pointed to her pocket, and she pulled out the coin."You can stay here, or you can go.I will not tell you what to do.But watching and waiting will do nothing but hurt you."She looked back at her body, with Dark Hair curled protectively over it, and Jonathan long gone.Her voice was sad."Jonathan is Allie's ex boyfriend.He was convinced I 'turned her gay' and that she was going to go to hell.I never knew he hated me enough to kill me..." Her voice trailed off, and she kneeled beside Allie.She reached out and ran her hand along Allie's face, but Allie didn't react.She pulled the coin out again, and the car door began to glow."Is that where I go?"She asked.I nodded, and walked with her to the car."What's after this?""I don't know."I answered honestly.She grabbed the door and it opened for her.Inside, it wasn't the interior of the car, but just golden glow.She looked back at me."Thank you."I nodded again, and looked back at Allie, crying over the body of her lover.
