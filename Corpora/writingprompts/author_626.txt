Every year, I felt a little bit older than I should on my birthday.And each year, I shuffled into the Lost Generation clinic to see baby\-faced Dr. Sherwood to report the sensation.Ah Mr. Murray!The same thing every year!Weve been talking about this for the last 10 years! Dr. Sherwood laughed.And every year you look the same, but I get older, I grumbled.You know I cant go back in time and give you Renuxia.It just wasnt safe for people over 26.Something about the telomeres at 26 caused the body to go into a hyperinflammatory, hyperaging state that caused rapidly fatal heart attacks, Dr. Sherwood gazed off into the distance.Read that in the history books, did you? I sneered.Now Mr. Murray, I may not have been around when they first started giving Renuxia, but I have been in practice for 20 years now.And I can assure you that the symptoms you are describing are completely consistent with the normal aging process.You have all of your faculties about you.Your memory is sharp as a tack!

Dr. Sherwood paused, but I did not have anything to say.Becoming more fatigued and feeling like time is passing more slowly is consistent with the normal aging process.If it is interfering with your daily activities though, it could be an early sign of depression.I know your wife recently passed Dr. Sherwood gave a therapeutic pause.I miss her, but thats normal after youve been with someone for over fifty years.I dont feel depressed though.Promise.

Okay, well if you ever need anything for depression or just want to talk, you have my number, Dr. Sherwood seemed satisfied with his extension of availability.I just cannot shake the feeling that the years are going by more slowly.Isnt there some way to test that?

Dr. Sherwood gave a bemused smile.Mr.Murray, Im afraid thats quite out of my discipline.Perhaps you could phone a physicist?Anyway, its good to see you sir.Have Doris get your bloodwork before you go.See you back in 6 months!

Maybe I will, I thought as I walked out of the office.My brother\-in\-law was still kicking and had been an aerospace engineer in an earlier life.Maybe he would know how to test my theory.\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Hey Chuck, how you been? I had not talked to him since the funeral.Not bad Rick.How you holding up?"Chuck answered over the video feed.Cant complain.Getting old as you can see, I grinned half\-heartedly.Look Chuck, I know we havent spoken in a while, but I just have to ask you a physics question.Its been bugging me.

Chuck was used to my dumb questions though he sometimes got tired of them I think.How could we tell if time was slowing down? I asked, expecting a glare or an eye roll.Chucks face tightened and he leaned forward into the video feed.Im going to call you from a secure feed, he said seriously.The feed went blank.\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Pardon my language Chuck, but just what the hell is going on? I thought, realizing that Dr. Sherwood was probably wrong after all.You feel it too? Chuck asked with cautious excitement.Of course I feel it.Every year it gets worse.This year it felt like my birthday took almost two years to get here. I was underestimating a bit.The eighty\-four to eighty\-five transition felt like my entire childhood.As if reading my thoughts, Chuck said, Thats it?I would have said five years at least.

Chucks eyes shifted nervously back and forth.Look, Ive been trying to figure this out for a few years now.I thought I was crazy.I asked a bunch of people who took Renuxia and they dont seem to feel it.But all the Lost Generation folks who are willing to answer the question  all of them agree that theyve felt it.

I stared blankly at the monitor.So I got an old NASA buddy to help check the atomic clocks.All of them are in sync.If you just look on Earth, time appears to be flowing normally.

Just on Earth?My eyes widened.But if we compare satellite feeds to earth clocks, there is a clear time distortion as the satellite gets older.Voyager I says were almost 60 years behind.

Thats about how long its been since Renuxia was released, I discovered aloud.Exactly.I just dont know who to talk to.Im afraid that if I talk to the parent company of Renuxia, theyll squash the information and maybe me along with it.And if I bring it to Capitol Hill, well, theyre the ones that mandated Renuxia in the first place.

So what do we do? I asked incredulously.Just give me a bit more time.There are some really interesting discoveries in the field of quantum theory that could explain this and maybe even figure out a way to reverse it.

I hung up the phone without a goodbye.Secure feeds only stay secure for so long.\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

After a restless sleep, I awoke to Margo barking.Whats wrong girl?You never bark!

Margo began to whimper and paw at the front door.Must have to pee.I opened the front door and Margo sprinted out the front gate.Damnit!Margo!Come back here!

Before I realized it, I was out in the middle of the street, looking across a chaotic scene.Cars piled up, apparently abandoned after the accidents.Oddly  only a few of the wrecks had bodies in them.A few mangled Lost Generation corpses.But no Ageless Generation bodies as far as the eye could see.Had they all just gotten up and walked away?I didnt remember Renuxia causing fast healing as a side effect.Margo had stopped at one of the car wrecks and was whining.Inside was Chuck, apparently unconscious, but alive.I ran up to the car.The accident seemed fairly minor, but an old\-timer like Chuck could have bled into his brain even from a minor trauma.Chuck!Chuck!Wake up! I yelled.Chucks eyes flitted and he turned his head.I had to tell you in person Rick.Looks like I chose the wrong time to be on the road.

Tell me what?

We figured it out.The Renuxia was creating a temporal dissociation.Everyone who took it was able to move through time without being affected by it.For the rest of us, time around us and within us proceeded as normal.The discrepancy created a temporal dissociation.

So what happened to everyone who took it?!They all just vanished? I took another survey of the wrecked cars.Temporal correction.I knew it was coming, but I didnt know it would happen this soon.It has only ever been theoretical in the past.Never had anything to produce it before.

Well were right fucked then arent we?Humanity is over!All the young folks are dead! My heart was racing.Renuxia was later found to be most effective when given as a series.And that doesnt start until age 5 Chuck trailed off.Better start rounding up the kids. I turned and walked toward the neighbors house where I could now hear a wan cry that had been drowned out previously by Margos barking.\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
