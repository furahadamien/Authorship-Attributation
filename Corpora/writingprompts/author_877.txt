Grandpa was running toward me screaming "STOP STAY AWAY!HE HAS THE POWER TO STOP TI..." 

And suddenly everyone stopped, again, all I saw was Dio screaming "ZA WARUDO" before it happened.I could barely move a finger, but I saw it happening in front of me, Dio just murdered my grandfather!When time resumed I was very angry!Grandpa last words were not to get angry, but my blood was boiling, I just wanted to punch that smug satisfied face to death.As Dio approached me I launched my stand towards him 

"ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA"

"MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA"
