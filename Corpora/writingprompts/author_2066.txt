Good Evening, this is the Intergalatic News Service, I'm Vol'Kath.Today, the intergalatic council met to talk about the problem of unexpected deaths within our galaxy.A singular planet has been identified as a potential cause of the problem.In a nearby star system, long ignored by explorers because of the primitive life form, the galactic council has discovered that the primitive life form has developed surprising ways to constantly reproduce.The planet is not host to almost 7 Billion people.Intergalatic Council President Hil'Lary Klin'ton announced today that the council will endeavour to make contact with these species and discuss their greater role in the universe and the problems that they are causing.Exploration ships have charted the planet previously and credit the reproductive capability to the tremendous resources on the planet include a substance called water.While the Intergalatic Council is normally against contacting other species in this overt way, the present crisis seems to have made it necessary.The council was split on the decision, 22-20.The bigger question is if this vote will effect the next galactic elections, in 2 universe cycles.In other news today.....
