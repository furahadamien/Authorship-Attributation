Blind full-time was much harder than blind part-time.When I woke up to my mother screaming and I didnt see out of both eyes this time, I figured I'd schedule another doctor appointment.My syndrome usually affects both eyes, and I guess I was fortune enough to only have it in one the past few years.Not only will I have to update my doctor, but I'll have to get a higher dosage.I tapped my way across my bedroom to the bathroom where my medicine was.These drops usually help bring my vision back but I'll have to get a higher dosage now that I need double the amount.But after taking my eye drops, nothing happened.And that's when I screamed too.The black never faded, and I always wanted to see little Jaxin grow up.Before the event, I could navigate short bursts of time being blind.I could walk around my home and navigate myself around the local area.Working though, was something I had to give up.One of the most infuriating features of the blindness was that I was almost done with my latest piece, but it will never be finished.Of course after denying every mentor who said self-portraits are the true obstacle to being an artist, I had relented.And now I'll never break that tiny barrier for myself.This morning I fumbled with a little ball of clay.Jaxin had grown quite a bit in size and I always wanted to remember him when he was small.Before the blindness, that could've been commemorated in photos or drawings.But this way I'll always be able to hold him.My fingers mashed and spread where I could to resemble what he might have.When I felt satisfied, I stored the half-done creation away.Maybe I can still do art.Maybe I can just finish what I started.I walked over to where a mirror was previously placed in my home before the event.Not that it would help any, but if I could just use it for a minute to adjust the light bouncing in the room, that would be great.When I touched around the wall, which was covered in dust, I couldnt find the mirror.I knew it was around here, but just out of reach.When I did reach it, in its place was cotton cloth."What the...."  I trailed off, clasping whatever was there between my fingers.When I set the object down on my work table, I clipped the fabric in hands and pulled to reveal the mirror beneath it.And suddenly the light wasnt just light anymore.It was manifested into an image- an image of myself.There was writing.It spelled out "Don't tell them you can see".I lifted my head and glanced around the room.My pictures that I had drawn before were more or less the same, and my art supplies was still strewn across the office.It looked barely lived in.I needed to see Jaxin.Without wasting another moment I pulled out my cellphone to call my mom."Hello?""Mom, where are you and jaxin?""We just left the store.Why, what's wrong?""I just need to see-" I stopped myself."Liv?""I just needed to see if you could come feel the progress I did.On Jaxin's sculpture"

"Oh?Oh, yeah okay.Well be home in a minute".I flipped my phone shut and went for the door of the office.Who wrote that message?Who did that in my home?When I went to the bathroom of my house i found the mirror left similar- covered.This time in newspapers taped onto it.I ripped them all down and there it was: dont tell anyone you can see now.Now?I stood for a moment lost in thought."Now".The mirrors have to be triggering my vision coming back.But who's "them"?What could they do to us if they knew we saw?When I heard jaxin and his gleeful laugh outside, I knew I needed to protect him and my mom.And that means keeping them from being targets.I ran back to my former art office and I grabbed spray paint and quickly glazed over the mirror I left in the office.I made my way to the bathroom and did the same for just about any mirror I could find.Then I opened the windows and turned on the fans to air out that God awful scent of spray paint.I heard the front door open and rushed down the stairs."Mom?""Hi honey."She set down a few bags.And there he was.Jaxin was two when the blindness came.And his once blond curls had darkened.The child-like chunkiness he had to his cheeks had hallowed out, and the small chubby toddler I once knew was a taller, darker haired skinny boy.That's when I lost it, truly.Searing hot tears rolled down my face and I felt a lump too big in my throat to speak."We got potato bread.Funniest thing today, I talked with Melissa this morning on the phone."mom continued."Her and Dave are considering marriage.Youd think after he ran off for all those years shed be scared of cold feet.But shes ecstatic."I couldnt say a word, so I didnt."Honey?Liv?""Hold on.I got something in my eye" 

"Oh, okay.You remember where the eye drops are?""Yeah.Thanks".As much as I wanted to take Jaxin into my arms and hold him forever, I turned up the stairs again to compose myself.I went to our bathroom once more and turned on the faucet.While the water ran I splashed it into my face.The room was mostly aired out by now, so I decided to shut the windows.When I walked over to the only one there, I seen it.I seen them.In the Mrs. Kratzers yard, I seen a figure.Dark, but roughly human sized.Only with more arms and legs and no face.I froze in the window, watching.Everything in me wanted to scream for Melissa to take her daughter and run, but I couldn't.Mrs. Kratzer sat on her porch, her daughter and Jaxin's best friend playing in the yard."Sadie, dinner is done!"She holared.Sadie stopped playing with her toys and grabbed the figures hand."Come on, dad!"She quipped as she drug him forward.Jaxin knocked on the bathroom door."Can I come in?""Yes"

He shuffled in and searched through the drawers of the cabinet.He pulled out a hair tie and began to tie his hair back.He needed a cut, but we all did.Maintenance went downhill.Laughter erupted from outside."Sadie sounds like shes having fun.Do you think mom will mind if I go eat dinner with Dave and Melissa?"I kept watching through the window.Melissa and that thing and sadie were all sat on their porch with sloppy Joe's in hand."I'd like it if you stayed home" I said.
