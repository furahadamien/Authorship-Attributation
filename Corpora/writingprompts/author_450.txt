It was the third time they called it "the war to end all wars".Surprisingly it hadn't been as bad as most would have thought it would prove to be.Neither side had gone all in with their nuclear arsenal and thus the world was spared an atomic ice age.These days it is hard to say what event actually sparked the war.The nuke in Jerusalem, the sinking of the Liaoning, the civil war in Turkey that everyone considered to be a great opportunity to settle some debts by proxy, the Russian Submarine that exploded in the Murmansk, the fire in the United States senate, the firefight at the Indian-Pakistani border or maybe the North Korean missile, that the Japanese tried to shoot down, but that lost it's course due  the damage and destroyed a major city on mainland China.Just like the first two times everybody was far too confident in their own strengths and decided they could win this.M.A.D.or mutual assured destruction didn't hold them back anymore.They trusted their defense systems and to a degree they were right.Most ICBM were destroyed before could reenter the atmosphere but this took out the satellites and filled the orbit with enough debris to prevent sending replacements any time soon.At the end, there were but two options left for the factions: To launch the remaining nukes and end the world or too agree to a ceasefire.The hopes for peace were faint, but for some reason they agreed on the following terms:

* There would be a ceasefire effective immediately
* All military and private vessels would return to their nations of origin within two weeks.Anybody caught after this grace period would be destroyed.* The would be no more contact between nations whatsoever for the next 50 year.Radio and other "leaking" forms of communication was outlawed.* China and Korea accepted the superiority of the United States and Europe would pay a one time tribute to them for saving the again.* Walls were to be built at the borders with wide stretches of buffer zones on both sides.After these were build and inspected, everyone would retreat behind their respective walls and not leave for the next 50 years.Both China and Russia had lost their leaders during the war and had yet to recover from it.Europe was once again in ruins, as seems to be traditional by now.But as most of the fighting had happened in the Pacific, it had not turned in an radioactive wasteland.The American president seemed to enjoy greatly, what he sold as a great victory to his people.They had dealt out a lot more than they had received and only three major cities had been obliterated.No enemy soldier had ever set foot on american soil.Africa and South America had been the site of several proxy wars and would have agreed to almost anything to archive peace.The isolation concept had a great appeal to Americans and was considered to be a great strategic advantage.They had more than enough resources and un-irradiated farmland to prosper.Many others were not so lucky, but that would not be an american problem anymore.Saving the world thrice from ruthless dictators was enough.The walls were build and inspected by the other parties and after that, everybody dug in and settled down.All contact forbidden for the next 50 years.Enough for the heroes and villains of the war to die of old age or at least retire.It took only a couple of weeks for the core of the EU to reinstate itself.They hadn't really quarreled and had had enough experience with walls and their demolition.London had been thoroughly humiliated by their former colony and followed shortly after.So did the other European countries.The nations of Africa enjoyed life without foreign meddling, for the first time in centuries, but decided they wouldn't need walls among themselves.The same happened with Russia and some of the nations that once belonged to the Soviet union.Even India and Pakistan decided they had more in common with each other, than with everybody else.After five years these Unions started talks and trade.And just like France and Germany had become friends after trying to conquer each other after for centuries, so did the they.Both Russia and China had been hit quite hard and thus they found themselves in need of help.There had been quite a lot of discussions, if the other nations should interfere, but at some point they decided to let the past be and help.The world rose from the ashes, closer than ever before.The United States celebrated what their leader had named "The greatest victory ever".He was granted a third and a fourth term and ruled with an iron fist until the second civil war came.America had needed new enemies, and the president had pushed the divide in it's population ever further.It wasn't so clear cut as north versus south had been, but mostly it had been coasts vs center.It must have started with small groups and militias attacking the targets of their opponents.The President condemned them, well mostly, but failed to calm things down.No one was even sure if he wanted to.When California declared it's independence he was furious, when others followed he sent the army after them.What happened later is still unclear, but a few weeks later a bright flash of light could be seen from Toronto.The fifty years were up six months ago and the United People of Earth have been preparing for the return of the Americans.So far we heard nothing.
