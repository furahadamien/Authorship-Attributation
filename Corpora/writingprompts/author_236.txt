Based on latest news for a work in progress navigation system for the blind:



&#x200B;

Hayun gazed at the horizon.The warmth of the sun caressed her skin and the scent of cherry trees recalled memories of a past spring.Sitting on the wall, in front of the usual small sanctuary to which she had spent her lunch break in the last five years, she moved her head and shoulders to the rhythm of the wild beats playing in her headsets.That day was too beautiful, that invitation to dance too irresistible and, even if it was disrespectful, it no longer mattered: she jumped up and started dancing, imagining the party described by the singer.After all, no one could see her.Then, with a hop and a twirl, she found herself blocked by the bench near the entrance.Two years before, when she was still working as a clothing saleswoman, she used to sit on that bench in respectful silence.The new freedom was something weird to think of.She wondered how the singer was currently doing, when by now the stage choreographies had lost all their effect.The thought saddened her.It could have been worse, she thought.People could not have had a navigation system for total blindness yet.Ms. Chieko Asakawa may not have been able to implement the AMOG system in such a short time, after the day of the Great Blindness.It had been a lucky coincidence that Asakawa was already pursuing the project to make bind people independent.She had worked all her life on it, since when she became blind due to an accident at the age of 14, to improve the living conditions of the blind.And now, she was the savior of the human race.Hayun remembered well the panic and confusion of the first week into Blindness of that February.Everyone trying to reach the hospitals, all of whom asked for help from equally blind doctors.Everyone wandering around supermarkets, trying to figure out what they were buying (or stealing) or how they could even cook it.No one knew why and how blindness had doomed every human on the planet.And even the newborns, after that day, never acquired sight.Since then organization was established: The AMOG system had made the navigation of blind humanity a less miserable existence.Synced with, and supported by Goggle, It spoke through a system of wireless headsets to users.AMOG was able to offer directions, help with cooking, shopping and general daily life.It also analyzed the signals of other nearby AMOGs, informing about their vicinity or important information, like someone being in distress.In particular, It was able to identify facial expressions and communicate them vocally if required.Really, it could have been a lot worse.&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On the way home from work, a school group passed by.All the schools had "Rehabilitation" programs.That word, had lost all meaning, but no one have had the courage to change the old hope for improvement.Although, everyone just started interpreting it as "getting used to being blind together".<It was nice when schools with all those specialisations still existed.What will they do now?>

Rei was not a pessimist, but that day he had had to deal with clients who had consumed his good mood.His voice was a grim lament.<Rei, I don't feel like talking about how beautiful this or that was.>

<Listen, you knew what I had.It was good.I can't just not talk about it all the times.>

<You still have a good salary and a good position.>    


<Please, you know what I'm talking about.What's the point of aiming high?>

<You are the one who wanted to become rich and successful.>    


<Like I don't know...But now there is nothing beautiful to own or something expensive to show off.Nobody cares anymore.>

Hayun felt invested by Rei's mood and regretted having walked the way together.<Everybody now lives a life in the perennial need for AMOG.Even politics doesn't make sense anymore.>

Rei often spoke of politics.It was the bee in his bonnet.&#x200B;

The ministers, who two years earlier had tried to instil the hope of reaching a solution for the sudden Blindness, had completely changed the way they spoke.Now they expressed themselves in an embarrassed way, a little out of place and without trying to put themselves so much in contrast between one and the other party anymore.After all, global interests had been turned upside down by that event.The sudden drop in demand for goods that were sold for appearance or beauty (not to mention the automotive sector) had destroyed much of what had become modern commerce.&#x200B;

With AMOG we knew where we were, where to go and where the others went.But the reasons were completely different.Desires, social pressures, prejudices: everything was muted and decelerated everyone's life.<I don't like it>, continued Rei.<AMOG knowing everything.>

<If for this, It is listening to you even now.>

<And what does it change?I'd just like to have my life back ... you know I'm in a bad mood today.>

Hayun nodded, but really didn't want to continue the topic.<Even the big companies seem to feel miserable.They are just having a bidding war, playing games on some country's scarcity of essential goods, making new economic agreements every day.Probably this is the only real monetary movement of importance now.>

Perhaps even the only entertainment of the old powers, Hayun thought.AMOG and Goggle, now represented the only companies holding what could have been considered as "power".But the Tokyo company was not for profit.The devices were built following government investments and donations, both by privates and by businesses, including Goggle.It was funny and miserable to admit it, but an almost sinister solidarity was born among the people.A disarming meekness that made the world strangely more pleasant to Hayun's glassy eyes.&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That day, at sunset, it was in her room that Hayun suddenly saw.In a blink of an eye, the blinding light and something that looked like color, invaded the curtain of darkness.And yet, when Hayun focused the room, she was sure she was in a totally strange place.Graffiti and scribbles covered the walls and floor.Hayun was so scared, shocked and excited, that she laughed nervously, touching her eyes, like something precious and fragile.Then she had turned around, staring at the painted wall.The same words repeating everywhere, over and over, with a single sentence: "Don't let them know you can see".Hayun didn't move.She almost didn't feel like breathing.Never she thought she could be terrified of seeing.&#x200B;

When it was time for dinner, her parents were waiting for her at the table.She kept her eyes wide open and played her part.Anyone who wrote that sentence had not found it wise to specify precisely who was "them".Were there any false blinds?Was there anyone who could see those writings?Was who wrote, blind themselves?Who was she suppose to hide from?There was someone, somewhere, who expected her to see one day.Because the writings were only in her room.<Dear, there is a letter addressed to you>, her mother began.<Printed this morning.Make it read by AMOG after dinner.>

But Hayun didn't wait.AMOG's voice was a beautiful voice.In the earphones, it resounded delicate, and very human.<Sight makes humanity blind>, said AMOG.
