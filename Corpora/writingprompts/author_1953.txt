The wallet bucked and writhed as warm black blood flowed from the bullet holes riddled in its hide into the night air.Screeching inhuman curses, it dissolved into a heap of multicolored muck and various pieces of wallet contents.The man holstered his pistol as he stooped down to pick up the various items; money, plastic cards, and an ID reading "Ines Eckhart".He stood and turned to the woman."You're safe now-" he started, before being interrupted by a swift slap to the side of his face."What the hell was that?!"she demanded as various wallet contents scattered across the alley."Nothing to be concerned with... you've been...dreaming."the man said as he fumbled around in his coat, half dazed by the surprise attack."Dreaming?Bullsh-" she began as the man continued to search his person more frantically.He'd forgotten it again.Without "Salazar's Spells for the Adult Learner" he couldn't remember "Short Term Memory Loss".In this situation, he would have turned and simply walked away.Instead, he glanced at the woman's hand.Somehow, his own wallet was clutched in a white knuckle grip.It'd be pointless to negotiate for it without answering some questions.The woman continued to speak, growing louder each sentence.He sighed."Miss... do you like coffee?"After assuring her she was in no danger and showing her his badge (conveniently disguised as a detective's) Ines and the stranger now sat inside a late-night cafe."Your wallet was replaced by that thing I shot in the alley.In my work's lingo, we call it an 'Imp'."Her eyes narrowed in suspicion as she brought the cup to her mouth.It was obvious that he wasn't a cop with or without the badge.There was a strange look about the man's face.While his face had the sharp angles of an adult, his features seemed a little young for someone of his size.Ines knew honesty when she saw it, so she agreed to talk further, aside from wanting answers to why her two-hundred dollar wallet bought last week turned into a snarling monster that spoke in a tongue she'd never imagined possible.She sat in thoughtful suspicion as "Al" explained his line of work.According to his story he was a contractor of sorts for an agency unknown, a set of careers hidden by popular dread."I'd picked up a strange aura..." he held up a smartphone showing the building in which Ines worked and continued, "that detected an unusually old Imp."The night aged by the hour as he told a tale that sounded like something out of a poorly formatted conspiracy website.They took the conversation outside as the barista shot another irritated glance at their table.Ines stood somewhere between aghast and astonished in the cold metropolitan air."Why did you tell me about that... about them... and about...you?"she said gazing at the inky black expanse above her.Al ran a hand through unkempt hair as he took a worried glance behind him."See... we need more people in our little enterprise.Call it a gut feeling, but I think you should consider us."He handed her a card emblazoned with the words **"Heracles & Furud Fortunes"** with an address on the back."You're serious?I-" she started, then stopped.Shaking her head, she explained that even if his story was true, she couldn't expect that his "gut" would be good advice to leave everything she knew behind.Ines offered the card back.Al stared at it, then at her.Nothing but silence passed between them in as the world went on its noisy way."They tell you life is meaningless, that you're just a speck on a rock in a void.All I suggest is that you know that cannot be true."He turned and walked the darkened street without the card.In his own mind he doubted his own judgement, what if the mark on her left hand had just been coincidence?She strode the streets without once glancing back.She tossed the card into the first trash can she saw.Stopping, she looked at the card in the grimy interior.The alley was silent in the way only city alleys can be.Light from a dying streetlamp illuminated the luster of the can's outside.Agnes paused for another second before walking a little quicker down her path.Behind her and just inside of her ear's range, she heard a trash can chuckle.EDIT: I know the prompt was in first-person, but I couldn't help myself.Hope you enjoyed it.
