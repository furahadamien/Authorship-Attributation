The movie starts.The screen is dark blue, we're under water.The camera points at the soil below and slowly sinks to the bottom of the ocean floor.We see a goblin shark and angler fish scurrying around.I look around at my other reincarnations and slide a little down in my seat.This can't be good.The camera pans up to look under a rock.We see an eerie appearance, the narrator tells us this is the Black Swallower.A horrifying potbelly has been found in tropical and temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, and can live as deep as 3,000 meters below the surface.We see it spawning eggs.My reincarnations look at me with disgust.Yeah, I fucked up guys.We're starting close to zero.But the camera pans into the ground.There lies a slug, born just a few hours earlier.We all sense it, this is our next incarnation.Loud sighs all around us.One of the reincarnations gets up and yells "Scheie!"in loud German.I look closer, it's Adolf Hitler himself.Or myself.He looks at me."Ich habe," he starts off in German but realises he needs to speak in the shared language of the Styx delta, namely English.Who would've guessed.He continues."I have fucked up!I knew I fucked up before.But *you* ruined it even more!People in *your* lifetime hated you even more than they hated *me*!You were the downgrade, you were supposed to *learn* and we would get to be something... something better!"Adolf sits down again and I remembered.After killing himself during World War 2 he came back to this room and previous incarnations all hated him for ruining it.His karma went below zero, unforgivable.They were watching my life unfold and I had all the opportunities to do it right.I should have learned.But I didn't, and now we're going to watch the short life of a sea slug being devoured by a Black Swallower.It's deserved, though.People hated me more than they hated Hitler.At least he was a decent painter, and suffered abuse during his life.People could relate to him in some ways.I look to my left and the sea slug appears.Its brain capacity rivals that of the average peanut, but I feel it's looking at me disapprovingly.Sorry, tiny me, the compound experience we all share will go on for a few hundred generations I expect.Let's see what's next, the score on our Reincarnation Board tells us this is going to be the worst incarnation by a long shot.Oh!We're human again!"Congratulations, it's a healthy baby boy," a doctor says.The camera zooms out to a crying mother and empty chair, noting the absent father.We see a glimpse of the mother's last name."Have you decided upon a name?"the nurse asks."Ah, shit.Ahh, shit.""What's wrong?""No, that's its name.Ajit.I hate people and children in particular, and I hope it'll get its childhood ruined.Maybe in the future it can ruin the lives of millions of other innocent people.""Ajit Pai?A shit pie?That's just cruel, madam.But it's your child I guess.Sign her off, we're done here."I sighed.This incarnation was during my own lifetime.Interesting, he is probably as hated as I was, maybe even more.The slug next to me starts to cry and I stand up.Hitler is still looking at the screen."Well, ich think that I'm going to hate this guy even more."He looks at me, stroking his moustache."In your defence, you didn't know what you were doing at all, herr Trump."I frowned.That's true, but I made more victims.My name will last longer in the history books than yours, Adolf.
