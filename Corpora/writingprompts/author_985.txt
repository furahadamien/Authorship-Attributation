I'll admit, it wasn't my proudest moment.I was working as at a bank, and a pretty strange guy came in to open an account.You probably know the type.Overly loud to cover his insecurities, laughs obnoxiously at his own jokes, weird clothes.Anyway, this guy comes in and has a sack full of cash to open an account.Plops it down on my desk and has me set it all up for him.We finish up around lunch time and I send the guy on his way, then head back to the vault with the money.It's right around then my stomach starts growling at me and I remember I left my lunch at home.Things have been a little tight around the home front with a new baby, so I'm feeling strapped.You can probably guess where this is going.I went ahead and took $10 out of the sack, and processed the deposit.I figured a guy with this much cash wouldn't miss it.Who misses $10 out of a $86,400 deposit?John Oker, apparently.Not that I found this out immediately.No, it was two years later.I was doing auditing work for a different company by this time, and was supposed to go inspect a warehouse for an important client.The place looked abandoned when I got there.No lights were coming out of this massive, old building.The paint was peeling, and most of the windows were still boarded up.Those that weren't were covered in a thick layer of grime that made it impossible to see inside.The remains of the sign for the old chemical plant that used to operate out of here still clung to the top parts of the wall, but a small wooden sign near the main door confirmed I was in the right place: "Laughing Planet Inc."

Inside was about a filthy as the outside.But there were definite signs of activity.Conveyor belts had been put in, and there were toys in various states of construction spread throughout."Hello?"I called.My voice echoed around the warehouse a bit.I started to turn to leave when an answer finally came."Jerry!So glad you could make it.Please, step on in."It was a man's voice.One I didn't recognize at first.I spun around and looked for the source of the voice, but didn't see anyone."Yes, I believe I had an appointment with Ms. Quinn?She was going to give me a tour of the facilities," I shouted back.There was another pause.Again, I almost gave up on the whole thing, which in hindsight, I should have."She won't be joining us, as she had another engagement come up unexpectedly.So I'll be giving you the tour."The voice came from right behind me.I spun around and recognized him immediately.The man from the bank.Still wearing the same strange clothes, now topped off with wild dyed hair and a heavily made up face.Before I could even get a word out, he took me by the arm and led me deeper into the building."As you can see, we had to let the janitor go," he said, before busting out his obnoxious laugh.He led me through a maze of of half built walls and empty crates until we came to a storage area."Here's where we keep the raw materials, Jerry.I expect you'll want to take an inventory."I leapt at the chance to start talking professionally.It took my mind off the strange circumstances I was in."Yes, that's correct.You know in small businesses like yours, it's actually shockingly common for employees to steal.One of the leading causes of those businesses going under is shrinkage, either at the till or in the inventory.""Oh, shrinkage you say!"Mr. Oker gave in to another fit of laughter.I didn't get the joke.I looked around the area and spied something sitting on the floor, so I stooped to pick it up."A ten dollar bill," I said."How careless!"the man in the strange purple clothes said."Well Jerry, finders-keepers, am I right?You can apply it toward your bill, or just pocket it.I'm sure you've earned it.""No, sir," I said with a nervous laugh."That would be unethical.You'd better take it."Mr. Oker stepped over to me and took the bill from my hand."Well I admire that Jerry, I really do.Ethics really is high on my list of must haves."He chuckled again, before continuing."In fact, I'd never let it go if someone stole from me.Not ever.If I found out someone had taken my money, why, I might buy a warehouse for a fake toy company, and lure the thief there, then strap him to the conveyor belts and run him through the machines."I tittered nervously.He didn't.He stepped closer to me, pressing me against some of the crates."Do you remember me, Jerry?""I'm sorry Mr. Oker, I..."

"Please, call me Joker."And that's when he punched me.One good whack to the head and I was out.When I woke up, I was strapped to the conveyor belts."Rise and shine, Jerry!"Joker shouted from a platform high above me.I watched as he dramatically heaved an enormous lever.The machinery sprang to life, and I started moving toward the metal contraption that would turn me into a child's plaything.I pulled against the ropes, but couldn't get free."Maybe your ethics will save you!"Joker called."No, but mine will," a gravely voice answered.I heard the dull sound of a fist hitting someone."Oh Bats, here to ruin my fun again!Even though I'm in the right this time!"Joker called.There was no answer this time, just the sounds of a scuffle.All I know for sure is that the machine turned off a minute before I was going to become a puppet.Sorry if this was a longer answer than you wanted, Commissioner Gordon, but to cut to the chase: yes, I have some idea of what the Joker wanted with me.*****

"I just don't know how I can live like this, Doc.Seeing her now just makes my skin crawl," Roger said, staring at the ceiling of his psychiatrist's office."And the medications I prescribed you haven't been helping?You still hallucinate that you're suddenly transported to see ex-girlfriend Liz?"Dr. Meadows asked."It just happened again two weeks ago.One minute I'm getting ready for work.Then I step out my front door and suddenly I'm on the other side of the state.And there she is looking all weepy and stuff.""And what did you do?""I turned around and left, just like I've been doing.Took three buses and a cab to get home.Somehow managed to not get fired."The doctor nodded her head slowly."I have to be honest with you Roger, your case is baffling to me.Your hallucinations are remarkably complex and vivid, and all manage to hold some kind of strange internal consistency, save for the fact that you magically teleport to other places.""I've heard this speech before Dr. Meadows.You're my third psychiatrist.I hoped that this new cocktail of drugs was going to do the trick too.But it sounds like I'm just certifiably crazy.Save your breath, and don't bother trying to refer me to someone else.I guess I'll just have to live with it.""I wasn't going to refer you away Roger.Your case *is* baffling to me, but I enjoy the challenge.We need to try some out of the box thinking here.Avoiding your hallucinations doesn't seem to be working.When you get home from here, I want you to look up your old high school flame and call her.The real one.Maybe some connection to the real version of her will help you move on from your subconscious' obsession with her.""Isn't that going to seem a bit, I dunno, stalker-ish?""It might," she said, standing to show Roger out."But have you really got anything to lose?""I guess not," he answered.He stepped out of her office, pulling the door shut behind him.As the door clicked shut, the hardwood floor of the office was instantly replaced with muddy grass.Heavy drops of rain pelted him from dark clouds hanging in the sky.A chill wind blew right through the thin jacket he was wearing.Roger looked around.He was standing in a cemetery.There was Liz, standing over an open grave, clinging tightly to an umbrella.A preacher of some kind stood in front of the grave, droning on in the bored tone of a man who wasn't getting paid enough to eulogize a man he didn't care about.Liz lifted her gaze from the grave, and her tear filled eyes met Roger's.He turned and started to walk away, but stopped.Roger turned back and looked at her.She was still staring at him, but now her expression turned to confusion.Roger hesitated a moment longer, then started walking toward her.She seemed to recoil slightly as he came and stood next to her.He looked at the grave marker.It was for Liz's dad.The two of them stood there wordlessly while the preacher finished his ceremony.Finally, he snapped his book closed, and nodded in the direction of the two of them.The preacher turned on heel, and left them standing by the open grave."I'm sorry, about your dad," Roger said finally."Thanks," Liz said softly."You haven't talked to me in a long time.""Not since high school.""I thought all those times I saw you walking away meant I was getting better.Somehow I'm glad that you're here though.It's better than being alone.But I guess this means I'm still crazy," she said.Roger looked at her, studying her expression."Who isn't these days?"he asked after a pause.She let a small laugh escape her lips.Liz looked at him, and smiled.It was the first time Roger had seen that since they had broken up."Would you stay here with me a while?"she asked softly, tears starting to well back up in her eyes."Sure," Roger answered.What did he have to lose?*****

Sam's alarm clock clicked on like it did every morning, playing the local sports talk radio station."Good morning, Sam!It's a beautiful day out there.Just the kind of day to finally drop that nasty habit.With NicoNever patches, you can finally move on with your life.No more dirty looks.Your teeth will whiten, and you can finally breathe that fresh air.NicoNever patches.They'll save your life," the clock radio blared.Sam groaned into his pillow.He groped for the clock, hitting the snooze button.*Maybe today should be the day*, Sam thought.*At least it would get everyone off my back.*

The alarm clock kicked on again, this time with a perfectly timed ad for Just Quit gum, flavored with Sam's favorite cherry flavoring.Sam climbed out of bed, and shut the clock off.He showered, and dressed, then hopped on his laptop to check his Facebook before heading to work."SMOKING SUPPORTS TERRORISM, SAM," one of the sponsored posts at the top of his feed read.Sam rolled his eyes.He snapped his laptop shut, and lit up a cigarette out of spite.Halfway through the cigarette, Sam checked his watch."Shit," he said aloud.He crushed out the cigarette, and jogged out of the house to his bus stop.He made it just as the bus arrived."Surprised you can even jog, Sam.What with your-" Sam flashed his bus pass and walked past the driver lecturing him.Sam took a seat in the back."What's that smell, Mom?"a little girl in the seat in front of him asked."That's the smell of Sam trying to kill himself, sweetheart," the little girl's mother answered.A small head popped up over the seat in front of him, looking Sam straight in the eye."Why do you want to kill yourself Mr.Sam?"she asked innocently."I don't.I just like to relax with a cigarette sometimes," Sam answered."But some self-righteous people really think that it's their job to tell me how to live.Do you know what self-righteous means?"The mother picked the little girl up, and moved to another seat, glaring at Sam.Sam went to work, where he endured more constant chastisement for his 'bad habit.'He couldn't smoke at work, that had been outlawed long ago.Same as smoking in bars, restaurants, parks, open spaces, and, ultimately, anywhere that wasn't a personal residence.But during long, trying mornings, like the one Sam was having, he snuck out behind the building to have a quick smoke.Sam was letting out a deep breath of smoke when one of his co-workers stepped out."Hey Sam," Penny said.Sam moved quickly to hide his cigarette."Don't worry about it," she continued."Most of us already know you sneak out here sometimes."Sam slumped his shoulders, then took another drag."So are you here to tell me to quit too?""No," she said."Just getting some fresh air.Been a shitty morning.Figured no one else would be out here on account of, well, you."Sam smiled.Her honesty was refreshing.After a couple minutes of silence, Penny spoke."Why don't you quit?It must be exhausting to have everyone on your case all the time.""It is," Sam answered."I've definitely thought about it.I even thought about it this morning.But something about it all just rubs me the wrong way.I'm not hurting anybody, no matter what everyone claims, and I'm not supporting terrorism.I'm just smoking a cigarette.Yes, it might cause me to die from cancer, but I get to make that choice for myself.I guess I keep doing it to hold on to that little bit of freedom.""Or rebellion," Penny observed."Or that.But fuck it, that's my call too.It helps me relax, so I'm going to keep doing it until it's not worth it."Penny nodded, seeming to think his words over.The two of them were quiet again.It was Penny who broke the silence again."Can I try one?"*****
