The whole neighbourhood was out in the streets staring skyward; dressed in robes and wrapped in blankets.The bright white light made them appear as stone sentinels against the snow.Mummy, the moon is so big!
My phone buzzed urgently in my hand.I set it on the nightstand facedown 
Grab your jacket lily, I wrapped my housecoat tight against me and zipped Lily into her parka.The light was brilliant; almost fluorescent.It radiated off the snow like an aura.Lilly stood breathless on the driveway, her face wide with wonder.I wished i could always see her like this; so wonderful.Its a beautiful night, my neighbour commented with her children cradled to her breast.I nodded and looked skyward at the fantastic beacon against the night.It was moving, falling from the sky.Mom, why are you crying?
I wiped my eyes and held Lilys shoulders tightly.Its just so beautiful baby.I love you.All was calm as the bomb cracked on the horizon and spilled over; swallowing everything.
