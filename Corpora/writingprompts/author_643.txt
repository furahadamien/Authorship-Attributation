I had always been resentful of my parents.All my life, I knew that my friends, my coworkers, everyone I interacted with would stop aging in their twenties, forever young and healthy and beautiful.And me?Well, my parents refused to have me vaccinated.After the first round of the anti-aging drug was administered to everyone under twenty-six, it was discovered that it worked best, and had the fewest side effects, if it was administered within the first year of life.So the government mandated that everyone be vaccinated against aging at birth--unless you had a religious exemption.Now, my parents are the least religious people you are likely to meet.However, when my mother discovered she was pregnant with me (an accident, she assured me.She never wanted to bring a child into this messed-up world) she and my father became "born-again Christians" in order to claim that religious exemption.They were among a minority of dissenting scientists and physicians who believed that the drug had not undergone sufficient testing, that more information was needed before subjecting humans to such a life-altering drug.So, when I was born, my parents had a priest present to vouch for their "sincerity" and "piety".Two days later, they brought me home, doomed to age in a world of perfect immortals.They told me what they had done when I was twelve.They probably would have kept me in the dark for longer than that, but one of the side effects of the vaccine turned out to be delayed puberty.While all of my friends still looked like children, I had shot up 6 inches, developed breasts, and--much to my horror--started my period.Once my teachers and friends found out why I was so different, they treated me like an invalid.When you have an eternity to live, why waste your time on someone who will barely be around for a century?I left my parents' house when I was eighteen, and didn't speak to them for decades.I tried everything to thwart my aging body, all to no avail.I never found a partner; hardly anyone wanted to be my *friend*.I was an aging anomaly in a world of the perpetually young and beautiful, and I hated every goddamn second of it.That is, until my fifty-fifth birthday.I had long since given up trying to hide my wrinkled skin and greying hair, and the cursed day was just another reminder of the fact that I was rapidly speeding towards my demise.I was in the middle of distracting myself from my dreaded mortality when I heard a knock on my apartment door."Who is it?"I called, too lazy to get up from my sagging couch."Jess?It's Emma!Let me in!"*Emma.* I hadn't spoken to her since--well, best not to think about that."Coming," I replied, my bones creaking a bit as I pushed myself off the couch and made my way across the room.I reluctantly undid the latch and pulled open the door.Needless to say, I was *not* prepared for what I saw next.Emma, perfect, young, gorgeous Emma, was absolutely *covered* in angry red lumps.They marred her previously flawless face, ran the course of her toned arms, and, judging by the awkward lumpiness of her jeans, scarred her legs as well.My jaw hung open, speechless.I was frozen there, unable to make heads or tails of what stood before me.As I stood there, Emma started crying."P-please," she all but whispered."You have to help me."---

Emma sat in front of me, face grimaced in pain as I methodically poked and prodded each of the large red lumps.I collected samples from a few--they oozed a viscous white liquid--but I couldn't bear to see the agony on her face each time I would cut into one of the lesions.As I worked, I asked her a battery of questions."When did you start noticing the bumps?""Oh, about a month ago.""Where did they appear first?""Just one or two under my armpits, then--" she blushed "--in my groin.I didn't think it was anything serious.""Were they painful then?""Not like now.Just tender.""How quickly did they spread?""There were new ones every day."I frowned, thinking.Even as a dermatologist--the Lost Generation still needed those, after all--I had never seen anything quite like this.I sat back and took off my gloves."Sit tight, Emma.I'm just going to take a look at these samples for a moment."She nodded, worry plain on her face.I sprinted down the stairs--sprinting was much harder now, I discovered--and turned on my high-powered microscope.*Just one of the perks of having an apartment right above my practice*, I mused.I spread the residue on a glass slide, placed a cover slip over it, and positioned it just so under the scope's powerful lens.I knew what was wrong immediately."Shitshitshitshitshit," I muttered as I ran back up the stairs, two at a time.The fatigue I felt barely even registered.I'd seen this thousands of times in my years of practice, but it was always in the Lost, the aging, the unlucky ones.Never once had I seen it in the younger crowd.In fact, the medical community considered it common knowledge that cancer would die out with the last of the Lost.I burst back into my apartment.One look at my face, and Emma burst into tears once more."It-It's bad, isn't it?"she asked.I nodded, slowly.I took her hand, covered in the cancerous red bumps, and looked her in the eye."Emma, you have cancer.A type of cancer I've never seen before.Even melanoma isn't *this* aggressive."She looked at me, dumbfounded."Are you sure?Th-They say--they say it's impossible...we-we're not supposed to get..." she trailed off."I know," I responded."I thought so, too.But this is unmistakable.We need to get you to a hospital, quickly."---

We drove in silence, save for the occasional sob from Emma in the passenger seat.My mind whirred with questions and theories, all tangling with one another in a mad blur.The facts were clear: before now, the only people who got cancer were those who had not received the anti-aging vaccine.However, Emma's case had the unmistakable appearance of cancer, a cancer more aggressive than I'd ever seen.The vaccine included a safeguard against uncontrolled cell growth--at least, according to its developers.Yet the drug *did* act by elongating telomeres--the protective caps at the ends of a strand of DNA--which would seem like a perfect recipe for cancer.The only question left was, why *now*?Why fifty-seven years later?That thought was interrupted by a long line of cars waiting to get into the hospital parking garage.The line did not appear to be moving; in fact, it looked as though there was an officer sending the cars away."What the..." I mused out loud.Emma and I exchanged a look.Then, we both leaped out of the car, keys still in the ignition, and bolted for the emergency room entrance.The ER was in chaos.Hundreds of patients--all perpetually young, like Emma--were crowded around the triage nurse, demanding to be seen.They were all covered in the exact same cancerous red bumps.Some had it so bad that they couldn't even stand up.On the television, the news anchor announced: "The President has declared a national state of emergency.Anyone who has received the anti-aging vaccine should report to the nearest hospital or clinic immediately and await further instruction.I repeat, we are in a national state of emergency."---
