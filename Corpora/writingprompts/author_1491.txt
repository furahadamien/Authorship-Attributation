I trudged wearily down the street."Goddammit guys, I love smoking and smoking loves me.Why don't you all try it?"I say, feeling a burst of joy at having tried to share this joy with others.To my utter dismay, everyone in a ten-foot radius back away.Feeling dejected, I begin the long walk back to my home.Suddenly, I stop in my tracks."WHAT THE FUCK!!!WHY IS THERE GRAFFITI ON MY HOUSE?"I call the cops, trembling in rage.I hear the jeering of my many neighbors who hate me while waiting for the police.Finally, the police come."Hello sir, how may I help you?"Feeling nervous, I take out a cigarette and start to smoke it.The policeman's expression turns into one from sympathy to utter disgust."Wait a minute, I've seen you in those stop smoking ads.I'm afraid I cannot help you... this burden will be yours, and yours alone.I came up with a few of those ads, you know."Says the policeman.I sigh.All right, all right...I'll just enter my house now.The policeman steps in front of me, blocking my way."What the fuck, man!This is my house!""I'm afraid not, sir.This is still considered a crime scene and needs to be investigated.You will be able to go back to your house sometime in the next month."I sighed."Where will I go then?"I asked the policeman."You... can visit our jail for a while."He said with a sneer."That's where smoking gets you."I sighed.Would this be my new life?
