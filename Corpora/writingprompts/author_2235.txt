Twinblaze
What the scans showed was impossible.Unheard of.Three potentially habitable planets in orbit around a single star.All within the acceptable temperature range, all with an oxygen-rich atmosphere.Granted, the readings from the second planet had some anomalies we couldn't explain, but it was hard enough finding a single habitable planet to colonize, especially when so many already contained intelligent life of their own.Finding three potential options at once was a miracle.The scouting mission was put together faster than I'd ever seen, and every single person in the program wanted to be on it.I was one of the lucky ones.Our goal was to blaze a trail for the largest colonization effort in history.Unfortunately, the universe had other ideas.What we hoped for was paradise.What we found was tragedy.Our estimates of the star's lifespan were off by a few million years.It was well on its way toward becoming a red giant, and the innermost of the three garden worlds had already been scoured clean.The other two were intact, but well out of the habitable range.But as surprised as we were to find this beautiful yellow star already dying, nothing could have compared to what we found next.The second of the three planets was surrounded by a massive amount of orbital debris, clearly artificial in nature.A perfect explanation for the anomalies in our readings, but one that would have been unthinkable to consider.Given the time it took for the light from this star to reach our research station, we were looking at the system as it was billions of years ago, long before intelligent life evolved in the galaxy.And yet, somehow, it was true.Somehow, intelligent life evolved on this planet faster than was ever thought possible.And just a few million years before our arrival, that life was wiped out.Later expeditions found that towering buildings had once covered nearly the entire surface of the second planet, and much of the other two.Estimates of the number of inhabitants were staggering.Far greater than we thought could possibly be supported by three small worlds.We were desperate for evidence of the technology that had allowed them to support such a densely packed civilization, but found nothing.Whatever devices held their secrets weren't built to last.Eventually, however, we discovered something different.A vault, built deep into the side of a mountain, containing vast stores of information that had survived the countless millennia unscathed.Here was where they had undoubtedly stored their most precious information.Scientists all over the galaxy were buzzing with excitement, wondering what new technology we might discover.Anthropologists begged to be allowed to examine the records to see what they could uncover about this ancient civilization.The government decided to share the information freely, and linguistic experts from countless species joined the effort to translate the language.Eventually, they succeeded, and the citizens on every world held their breath as they revealed what precious knowledge these ancient people had so carefully preserved.They were names.Families.Sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, uncles and aunts, ancestors going back countless generations.Trillions of souls, preserved in memory by their connections to one another.A passionate plea from a long-dead people, saying "We remembered them.Please, remember us."And we did.To this day, many parents choose a name for their child by combing through the endless list we recovered.Julia Wagner.DeSean Williams.Li Wei Chen.Imani Abara.We don't know who they were, or how they felt being alone in the universe, but we remember them.^(The inspiration for this story was the Granite Mountain Records Vault)
