Humanity clung to any semblance of hope as the plague descended upon the few of us left.20 million had died in the first year alone.In the years following another 40 million would fall victim to what was simply referred do as blue death. What made it so terrifying was how quickly it evolved.We couldnt cure it, but we could prevent it.Its been nearly 40 years since we began vaccinating survivors and our children.Governments had made the vaccination mandatory, but now, years later those same children we had saved would go on to say the vaccination had unintended consequences, aside from the obvious blue tint to the skin.Although entirely unproven this new generation claimed the vaccine caused a much higher risk of diabetes.Sure cases had increased since we began vaccinating but the correlation does not mean its the cause.The new generation in power stupidly gave people the choice to vaccinate their children.It was obvious how quickly this uninformed rumor had spread.Many children no longer had their blue tint.It wasnt long before the inevitable happened.Cases of blue death began popping up all over the globe.Despite all our research the monster had returned bearing its fangs.Researchers couldnt get ahead of it.Many turned to religion to escape the reality of our situation.Belief that beyond this doomed world existed another one.Perfect.Free of suffering.A hopeless prayer.Still, as I waited for humanity to destroy itself I needed to occupy the time.I was curious what these people saw.Why they grasped for something they could not see.I began to study religion relentlessly.Not any one in particular, but anything I could get my hands on.Through all of the muck I came across a diamond.Sitting patiently in the dirt as if it were waiting to be found.Something so simple it was easily overlooked.I discovered a sort of roadmap within the texts on Norse mythology.A golden staircase if you will to what they referred to as Valhalla.The only requirement was an honorable death by sword.It did not discriminate.Not by race, gender, or ideals.I had no proof.Only a gut feeling and confidence in my research.I walked outside to my shed.Bullets wouldnt do.They werent personal enough.There was no honor in death by an enemy you cant see.I didnt exactly own a sword but I could certainly find something.I would save as many as I could.Emergency services were so busy trying to contain outbreaks that I could probably go a few weeks before they noticed the murders were linked.Ill save as many as I can. 

I picked up the old dagger and stumbled toward the town.
