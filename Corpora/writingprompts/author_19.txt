So my friends and I had some "funny juice" and...

Bob runs his hands through his chettoed afro.He has no palette, no paint, no words.A young man is staring at him.He almost forgets.Hitler!He didnt realize the sigh that escaped his lips.A hand darts to his throat.He dodges.Not you again! A young Adolf says.His eyes quiver, skin full of youth and naive but known fear

You came to me last night in my dream.I recognize you, Hitler says.You tried to convince me to mix the red and blue paints together to make purple.ALL the colors stay separate!

Bob walked to the window.It felt strange but familiar to walk not only in a house he didnt know, but a time he didnt know.He put his finger to his mouth.Adolf. He said, without turning.For a moment, Adolf softened like a popsicle, but hardened himself again.Ill kill you, Ill kill you! He pulled a glint out of his pocket and swiped at Bobs turned back.Bob whipped around and grabbed his wrist.Adolf. He said again.Masterful.Knowing.When will you be finished with these petty games?Lets begin your real lesson.

Bob let go of Adolfs wrist.He took off his coat, took out a brush and held it before Adolfs furrowed brow.
