Robert Schafer is the name on my card because that is my name.The account numbers are right, the pin is right.But the account is 10 dollars off.I knew it wasnt right when the ATM spit out the receipt documenting my account balance.I was only slightly irritated by this.It was when the bank kept calling me to confirm the use of my card that I got unreasonably mad.The card was used in New Mexico, at a Taco Bell.One of two things must have tipped off the bank.One: I dont live anywhere near, and have never been to New Mexico, and Two: I have never eaten at Taco Bell a day in my life.The bank reimbursed me the 10 dollars, but it took no less than 6 phone calls, 2 visits to my local branch, and, and 1 piece of paper signed.That all took 16 dollars for gas.86,384:
Man was I pissed.Its not about the money.Its the principle of the matter.They stole from me.Moreover, they stole time from me!Time wasted going to the bank, on the phone with managers, and sitting in waiting rooms.No.This could not go unpunished.I had never been to New Mexico, but it was time I worked on my tan.So I started driving.I drove for eleven and half hours, almost non-stop.Gas was remarkably cheap.72.11 cents for the one way trip.Snacks were around 27 dollars, as I stocked up so I didnt have to stop any more than I needed to.86,284.39: 
I had driven to New Mexico without a thought.Almost in a rage the entire way.The only thing that kept me calm was the musings of an Ellen DeGeneres audio book my Mother left in my car when she borrowed it last week.Ellen told me to keep on dancing.That I would find a way through this trouble time, or some such shit I didnt believe, but entertained so I didnt drive off the road and smash into a tree.It was a blind rage.I didnt even realize I was seething, even as I talked through gritted teeth to order my hotel room.How long a stay?Until Im done.And Im not going to be done until I at least look this person in the eye and ask them why? 

The total of my hotel came up to 6,753.49.Not mention all the hotel food I bought whichshittoo many receipts at this point.Id say, roughly, another 1500 dollars.Im going to round all my prices from here on out.This is giving me a headache.78,030.90: 
Not doing so bad I guess.I did some reconnaissance of Taco Bell.Luckily for me, they had old fashioned diner right across the street.I would eat lunch there just to make it look less suspicious.Then I would stay there for 4 hours at a time to make it look exactly as suspicious as it really was.The tab there was another 600 dollars.I had a lovely waiter named Rob.We hit it off right away, seeing as we are both named Rob.He was funny, kind, but never gave me a discount.I didnt mind.I kind of respected him for it.Business oriented.I liked that.77,430.90: 
I sat a few days at the diner before I realized I had no idea what I was looking for.I emailed the bank, and they sent me a security picture of the person.It was not very well done.It was a man in an AC/DC shirt, and a red baseball cap.I couldnt tell but it was probably one of those Make America Great Again hats.I hate him even more now.Now that I knew what I was looking for, I needed real spy equipment.The shit you see in the movies.I was off to Best Buy.One Canon camera (with extra-long lens): 1600 dollars.4 extra batteries (so I would never run out of juice): 120 dollars.A wall charger (to charge all my dead, yet cool spy shit): 50 dollars.Binoculars (just to look cool): 200 dollars.A bag to hold it all (because frankly, its a lot of stuff): 100 dollars.Now I looked even more suspicious when I got to the diner.75,360.90:
I hadnt really thought through what I would do if I caught this guy.Probably a strong word or two?A punch to the mouth?It was all such a whirlwind.Just as I was musing the pain I could bring on this unknown assailant to my bank account, I saw a man, looking just about like the guy from the picture, walk into the Taco Bell.Black AC/DC shirt and a MAGA hate.I saw red, and not just his poor choice of headwear.I was so mad, I left all my super cool, spy shit on my usual table, and stormed over to the Taco Bell.I burst through the door, and into the line of fat people, to see my nemesis at the front of the line.I cut through the sea of cows, and right behind him.Just then, I see the man pay for his meal with a card, which has none of my info on in it.It isnt even the same color.But I see his name.John Johnson.I restrain myself from any interaction, and the herd complains that I cut them.I leave before things get too serious, and back to my designated table at the diner.I type his name into the internet, and pay a 50 dollar fee to search get all the information that I can get on this guy.Address, phone number, landline.Who the hell still has a landline??This republican fuck, thats who.75,310.90: 
I scope the Taco Bell and see the guy come back a few more times over the next few days.He loves it.I cant wait to knock the chalupa right out of his mouth.But by this point I am frothing at the mouth, and ready to go.So I start asking around seedy motels, and bars about places to buy things that I am not supposed to have.Namely in the vein of things that go boom.Breaking Bad was right.This stuff is easy to find in New Mexico.Everyone is looking for a dollar, but they charge a lot of money for it.Apparently filing serial numbers off of guns that were stolen from the police makes the price of said guns go up.Way up.It took me another 75,000 dollars to get the guns, and enough ammo to take on the Alamo.310:90: 
What I am about to do, there is no coming back from, so I rented a car as a getaway, and I get the insurance because I am about to fuck this thing up.That costs 300 bucks.Then I order my last lunch for 10.65.Rob stands over me, giving me my last order of Chicken fried steak, and notices me shoveling it into my mouth, my face changing different shades of red.He sits across from me, and asks me if everything is alright, and at this point, my story just flows out of my mouth.All the gory details.Cross country trip, expensive hotel bill, my cool spy shit, and my new collections of untraceable death.Rob is taken aback, but he listens.Oddly, I feel better letting it all out..25: 
Rob sits silently after I finish off my story, and polish off the last of my last supper.I had been so blinded by rage, my singular purpose, and the thought that what I was doing was justified by the principle of the matter that I forgot everything else.Rob then tells me he too had a mix up with his bank.He pulls out his debit card, and our numbers match identically.Apparently his name is Robert Schafer too.Even more apparently, they sent him my card by mistake, and hadnt realized, even after they sent me through a slightly inconvenient hell to fix it.He says he pays his bill from his savings, and hardly ever uses his debit card.He works three jobs just to make ends meet, because his wife stays at home to take care of their newborn son.He comes into this job every day for the lunch rush.He says the last time he used his card was several months ago, to buy ten dollars worth of Taco Bell for his starving family.We sit silently.My rage has been completely drained, and now I own a bunch of crap I dont need, or want.My actions were illegal, psychotic, and borderline murderousall over 10 dollars.10 dollars that New Mexico Rob needed more than me.I thank him, and leave him my bag of spy goodies, telling him to pawn them for as much as he can get from it.I take the rental car into the desert and bury the guns, seeing as I have no use for them, and the guy I bought them from doesnt exactly have a return policy.I returned the rental, and used my very last quarter at this pay phone to call you, so I could ask you a question.Can I borrow ten bucks?
