I lived in constant dizziness; a fog swirled and meld with cold, dense mist inside my mind.My thoughts were hollow, empty.The passage of time ceased to exist, for a second I stared at the pristine snow, at the blinding sun, and a moment later I was soaring the night sky in a wooden sleigh pulled by colorful deer.It had been my curse, my fate, the cost for staying alive, if you will, to live life in such a way.I'd been captured by a civilization of tiny people, called elves, and they'd put me under a spell to be their emissary once a year.I wasn't aware of what I did, but flashes of cozy, sleeping, and smiling kids often came to my mind, and so I knew my unwilling deeds weren't something wicked.Things took a turn, however, when a little elf came before me, lifted the spell, and spoke to me in a far-flung nook of the Arctic, where no other elf could see us.He was against what his people's doing, said it was slavery, and that I could escape in the flying sleigh if I wished to, but he explained to me they didn't truly understand what they were doing to me, as they had only one purpose: to make the kids smile.I pondered over his offer a great deal.This wasn't life, for I did things, but I only remembered a sliver of those things.However, at last, after I had went through a long list of questions regarding the whole situation, I asked him, "So, do I bring joy to the kids?""Yes, they wait for you every year with unparalleled eagerness," the elf said, dancing a small jive at the rhythm of his melodic words.What he said struck the core of my heart, made me wince and grimace.I was under a spell, yes, but he convinced me there were no evil intentions in the elves' doing, they simply didn't understand, or so I chose to believe, that putting people under a spell was a different sort of torture, but a torture after all.Deep down, despite the years I'd lost, I couldn't feel hatred nor resentment against them.After all, those years I'd lost of my life meant the smiles of kids across the world.It was a small price to pay for such a beautiful thing.One I would pay time and time again."What if I do it willingly?"I said to the twinkling elf."Some of your people can come with me in the sleg and watch over me, make sure I don't ruin christmas, and if I do, you can put me under the spell again.""I was hoping you said that," the elf said, smiling."Let's go home, and meet the family.They will be joyous to finally be able to call you by your true name."I laughed, and waved my hands dismissively."The kids know me as Santa.They don't understand the meaning the word has in your language.But I would very much like to add my name to it, if that's a possibility."The elf beamed and nodded."Sure thing!Would you tell me your name?""It's Nicholas, but people call me Claus."---------------------------

There was nothing but desolation.The land around him was a hardpan full of fissures from where little errant trees and low blades of grass rose.The wind was humid and heavy, and it carried an odd sort of heat.He found himself on the greatest tree laying on the thickest bough, and from there he eyed the seam of land and sky, and there he found nothing but a gray day and vast solitude.He was alone in a place he didn't know, clad in wet heaviness, and full of long and strange hairs.His thoughts spun and eddied, perhaps in an attempt to slink into the deepest burrows of his mind and disinter an immemorial memory, for this place, in odd ways, was familiar to him.But for all that he tried, nothing did he find.And so, seeking for an answer, through careful movements he clambered down the tree, but even with his care his motions were unfamiliar, almost alien to him, and so a branch cracked and a new fissure ran across the already cracked surface.He rose to his feet grumbling, and even the way he grumbled seemed alien.It was then when he looked at his hands, at the size of and color of them, at the amount of hairs and their thickness.There, with the wind muted and the shapeless veil of silence crowding the land, he remembered.There was no desperation within him, no thundering heart, nor anything of the sort.There was one thing only, and that thing was an idea, an objective.That idea was enormous, so much so that it gave no space for others ideas to be thought.He roved forth in this body that'd ceased being his a long time ago.Nights and days he ambled, hiding from creatures he barely remembered, clinging on to his deepest instincts to survive, but his wandering journey came to an end during the first night with a full moon, for there in the moonlit land, rising from a crevasse was a mushroom, and it was no common mushroom, for even looking at it filled him with joy.Without hesitation, he reached for it, climbed to the tallest branch in the tallest tree, and there he ate, and all of this he did with a smile.Many times he returned to the hardpan, many times he returned to the desolation, and many times he sought for a new mushroom.After all, they were the gate to his true life.----------------------------

The thought came unbidden.But there it was, lodged in between the intangible folds of his mind.He ignored it at first, yet the trembling of his rattling bones, and the fast, steady thrumming of his heart spoke of an ever-settled fear.He was twenty now.It'd been ten years since he'd put on the goggles.Ten years of ups and downs, of friendships, broken hearts, and laughter.But the thought, like a shard, twisted and interred itself deeper and deeper.It would only take a swift, simple movement of his hand to confirm or destroy his suspicion.But was it a suspicion?If it were a trifling, meager doubt; a silly thought, then why was he feeling such terror?He knew what would happen when he reached for his eyes: the air would become heavy weight on the heel of his palms, and the lake, like a rising backdrop, would disappear, and be replaced with who knows what.He sat on the edge of his bed.Drew a deep breath, felt the thrumming of his heart rippling through his hollow chest.*Boom*

*Boom*

*Boom*

*Breathe*

Arms shaking, lips trembling, eyes twitching, he reached for his eyes--halted mid-motion, and gulped down the brewing fear materialized in the shape of scalding nausea.And then he took them off.His room turned into a forest of great pines.Their shadows fell upon him and the mud-covered log he was sitting on.The scent of dry pinecones, burgeoning flowers, and sundry berries billowed into his nostrils.They were clean, whelming, cleansing.The autumn colors of the trees glistened upon his eyes, throwing red and yellows streaks over their black surface.There were so vibrant, so concise and palpable.They were so real, so beautiful.*Breathe*

A tear meandered down his cheek, followed by an army of them.The fear knitting his insides turned into a wriggling, rising anguish that sped up the thrumming of his heart.How much time had he lost?Where was he?Who was he?Through teary-eyed eyes, he gazed at the googles in his hand.They were the root of his despair.No--no, that was not true.His stupidity, his lack of self-awareness was the issue, not the goggles.He'd spent half his life living in an unreal reality, and it was time he'd never get back.But he was somewhere in that reality.Here, in the beautiful wild, with all his senses awakening from their dormant state, everything fit like the pieces of puzzle.Everything was too real, too tangible, too perfect.It was a flawless puzzle, save for a lonely piece that used to fit, but didn't anymore.And so, blinking tears away, he put his goggles back on.The fear was gone.-------------------------------------

Death, like sleep, came to me all of a sudden.An errant bullet right through the brain, and the concrete dissolved into a field of dead grass; the buildings crumbled down; the clouds of dirt turned black and held onto the surface like a thick, ever-spreading mist; the sun forgot to shine, and in its forgetfullness it wound up dying.I rose to my feet.The wind carried ice on its currents, turning my bones into rattling things.With my hands in the refuge of my armpits, I wandered through the blackness in a state of utter confusion.In the distance, ceaseless shrilling screams boomed and faded, echoed and faded, thundered and faded.Amidst the fog, the mist, the shadows, there a tiny light shone.It was a small moon hovering knee-high, but despite its size, it illuminated fiercely, forcing the darkness to scurry away.After a minute of walking toward it, I saw a hand holding it in place.When I reached it, my eyes strayed to the hand, climbed up the arm, until it arrived to the face of the man who held it."Marc?"I said, and his lips curled upward."What are you doing here?""You showed me love, you showed me kindness when I was buried in darkness.And it's finally time for me to do the same for you," he said, held out the little moon for me to hold."Here, it's yours.You will need it."My brows knitted."What will I need it for?""That answer doesn't belong to me," he said, and his voice became brittle, distant."But you have my gift, carry it.It's not a pleasant journey that in which there's no light."With that, as though he was no more than a breeze, he disappeared.I caught the moon before it struck the grass, and with an aching heart, and a racing mind, I kept moving forward.I ambled, I wandered, I roved, and I trod.I did so, well aware that I was lost, but well aware that stillness would take me nowhere.And then, in the space of a breath, the shadows parted and from the blackness that was revealed, there came a man whose face I didn't know, but whose eyes carried a tangible longing.He came, and without uttering a word, he embraced me."I'm sorry," he whispered, his voice tarnished with grief."Who are you?"He let go, and held my gaze, his eyes glossy with tears."The bullet was meant for me.It shouldn't have ever killed you."I swallowed, drew a deep breath, and sought in the innermost tunnels of myself for something to say."You don't have to apologize.Fate is strange, and you weren't the one who shot."He shook his head."But I'm the reason the gun was shot.Nasty business lead to nasty things.I owed money, and--and--"

"There's nothing to worry about.Life has many paths for all of us.Did things get better after I died?"He looked at me, and nodded, his lips tight."I left, got as far away as I could, and started a different life.I thought my life was worthless, and that took me down that somber path, but when the bullet hit you, everything within me crumbled apart.My lack of self-worth wound up taking away the life of an innocent man."I rested a palm upon his shoulder."I forgive you.I really do."He drew a deep breath, a tear fell down his cheek.He held my eyes then, and said, "You taught me the value of life, and for that I will ever be grateful."And with that, he faded away.With a heavy heart, I kept wandering.Perhaps I should have been harsher on him.Perhaps I should have shouted at him, but when I sought within me, I found no hatred, no rancor, nothing at all.And deep down, I knew my words had been the right ones.The screams faded.They were buried underneath a deafening noise.I turned to it.On the horizon, a world of light collided against this world of darkness.It was a strange thing to witness, like two opposite, endless gales clashing, retreating, and clashing again.This time, I ran toward it, toward the light.But the closer I got the farther the darkness seemed to push it away.When I reached the battle, I found myself standing in the point where both forces commingled, and from there, came my wife."Lucy?"I said, and this time I was the one who hugged and cried."What are you doing here, honey?Tell me you are still alive."She wrapped her arms around me, rested her head on my chest."I am.But I don't know if I am."Her voice was fragile, on the verge of breaking."Why do you say that?""Because you left me, you left me forever, and I don't if I can keep going.My heart aches too much, my thoughts are nothing but memories of you, it is as if I had died with you.You were my everything, and when you left I became nothing."I tightened my embrace, let the silence hung for a moment."There's always value in life, honey.A friend told me that.I might be gone, but our little Lily is still there, with you.You have to be strong, for her, for you, and for me."I kissed her forehead."I might be gone, but I will always be with you and with Lily, even if I have to fight the devil itself.Promise me you will keep going."She raised her head, held my gaze.Her eyes were red, full of tears, her lips downturned.She shook her head."I--I can't.It's too dark in here," she said, and touched her chest."You can, honey," I held out the moon for her."Hold on to it dearly, until there's nothing but light within you.Then give it to someone who needs it."She grabbed the moon with both hands, held it to her chest, its shine falling on her face."Promise me you will keep going," I said, wrapped my arms around her waist, and rested my head against hers."Promise me.""I promise," she said, and pushed the moon into her chest.It parted into white tendrils and, in a slow dance, billowed their way into her heart.Her eyes drew to mine.My eyes drew to hers, and at the same time, as though we both knew what came next, we said, 

"I love you, forever."There was a surge of light, a blinding one.I closed my eyes.The coldness faded.I felt her leaving.And then came warmth.I opened my eyes, and an old man was standing in front of me.Behind him a sea of clouds swayed, and from their heart, a golden gate rose."May we go?"he asked."Do I deserve it?""Well, that's up to you.You are the last judge."I looked at him."Will I get to see my daughter grow up?"He nodded."We may go, then."------------------

The rattling of the keys followed by the clicking of the locks sent me jumping to my feet.Since mom had passed, I was the only one with keys to the house.I barreled toward my room's drawer, and took my pistol from underneath a bundle of folded sheets.In the entrance, the wood creaked, and the door grated shut.Heart thumping, I loaded the gun, ears strained, and skulked toward the noises, attempting to predict where the intruder was heading to.He was coming straight to my room.I sprung behind the bed, hiding.The steps got louder, until the door swung open, and a soft, papery said, "Ophelia, where have you gone?I've got the cigarettes."I frowned.He knew my mother?That voice.It sounded so familiar.I craned my neck slightly to see the intruder, gun at the ready.It was then when my heart sank to the depths of my stomach.I gulped down all the stress and worries knotting my chest, and put the lock back into the gun before hiding it into my pocket."Dad?""Oh hey, Ricky.What are you doing hiding over there?"he said nonchalantly.Although ten years had gone by, only a handful of new wrinkles lined his pale-white skin."Have you seen' your mother?I brought her the camels she asked for.Let me tell you, she better come back soon cause they ain't cheap, and I crave a good smoke.""What do you mean if I have seen mom?"I met his eyes."Where had you been.It's been ten years!We thought you had been kidnapped or murdered!"His brows drew into a deep scowl."Ten years?Son, ain't you a crazy one.It ain't April Fools just yet, and you already playing jokes.Now, tell your mother I stole two cigarettes from the package.I will be downstairs, watching the football."He walked to the door, halted and turned to me, head tilted."You should let that beard grow, you lookin' like a boy with that baby skin."Then, smiling, he went downstairs.I sat on the edge of the bed, perplexed, ran my hands ran through my beard.It was thick and long, worthy of a lumberjack.I'd let it grow due to him.He'd always said the say thing to me before he left us ten years ago, and I thought that, perhaps, in some strange way, he'd comeback just to see if I'd grown a proper beard, and he would hug me and congratulate me, tell me I looked like the man he'd always wanted as a son.And now, ten years later, he'd walked in the house as if not a second had gone by, and for some odd reason he didn't see the effects time had had on me.I headed downstairs.Perhaps I could snatch something out of him.*I'm tellin' you, darling.Two dollars a package of camels?It ain't right.* I heard him said in the distance.*Damned be the day we smoke the first one.I'm tellin' you, it will take us to the grave.*

Who was he talking to?Why was he in the kitchen."Dad, who are you speaking with?"I asked as I walked into the kitchen.He was leaning against the refrigerator, smoking a cigarette and grinning.Although his lips shut into a line and his brows creased when he heard my question."I don't know what has gotten into your mind, son," he said and pointed to an empty chair."I'm talking to your mother right there.Have you been smoking the devil's lettuce?""I--I--I was just playing a joke.Hello mom," I said and waved at the chair.Then, I dug out my phone from pocket, and went to the bathroom so I could speak without being heard."Be right back.""911 what's your emergency?""It's my dad.He's been missing for ten years.He came into my house walking as if not a second had gone by.""Keep calm, sir.Is he hostile?""No, he-he's acting as he always had.I'm starting to believe there's something wrong with him.""Wrong in what way, sir?""In his brain.He's acting crazy.My mom passed eight years ago, and he's convinced she's there with him.And I believe he sees me as if I were still a teenager.""Are you safe, sir?""I am.""Has anyone in your family ever had problems with mental diseases like dementia or schizophrenia?""My grandmother and grandfather had dementia.""I'm sending an ambulance right now.Confirm please your address is Shelpshire 722.Follow your father's train of thought until the doctors arrive.Don't scare nor agitate him.As you said, it seems like he's suffering from something. ""That is my address.Thank you very much."I hung up, got out the bathroom and went back to the kitchen.He was not there.Desperate, I searched the house.But the silence was absolute, and every room was empty.His keys were atop the kitchen's table, and so were his cigarettes.On my bed I found a note.*Didn't want to disturb you while you were doing your private things, son.Your mother ran out of cigarettes.I went to the store to buy some, I will be back in thirty minutes.*

In time, the doctors rang the bell.Shaking, I opened the door for the doctors to come in."Doctor Tart?What are you doing here?I--I--my father!He came back left a note.It's over there on the table.Come, please come.""Calm down, Ricky," Tart said, placed a hand on my shoulder."It's gonna be all right.""All the pills are in the flask, Tart," the other doctor said."Ricky, where is that note?""Over there, on the table."I pointed at it, and everything inside me shattered.There was nothing there."It's the third time he has done this, Tart," the other doctor said."He refuses to take his medicine.His hallucinations are getting worse.I told you he was not ready to get out the ward.We must take him back.""The ward?"I said, my extremities quivering wildly."What ward?Why is it so cold in here?""Listen, Ricky," Tart said, his eyes gentle, voice caring."I will give you one last opportunity.You have to take your pills.Will you cooperate with us this time?It's for your own good.I understand you feel like an addict, but you have to understand too that you need them.Will you take them?""Yes," I said.The other doctor held out a pill for me.I swallowed it."But he was here.I swear it.He was here.He's suffering from dementia.I swear."The doctors shared a knowing look."What is that look.Are you going to take me by force back to the ward?"I fought to hold back rising tears."Ricky," Tart said, took a deep breath, his lips a tight line."What is it, doctor?""Your father died of a heart attack ten years ago.He collapsed on the streets.You were going to the store with him when it happened."--------------------------
