Steve Rogers slid down the wall of the flying wing struggling to get back to his feet, uttering "I can do this all day.""I think now Captain 'America'," stated Red Skull confidently as he strode to the center of the cabin, "I think that without Shield, you are nothing.""Prepare to be disappointed then," stated Steve Rogers as he achingly got back to his feet.There was little of the confidence or bravado that he had entered the room with, that had been slowly beaten out of him over the past few minutes.Only a little bit more he hoped.Red Skull grinned wickedly, marching towards Captain America until a mighty bark filled the room, a bark that had brought terror to the German army for years now,  grin fading he turned back to see the vile dog, "Mighty Shield?How?""He knows many tricks, like flying one of your captured gyrorotors," stated Steve, confidence again filling him."Then why was he not here already," asked Red Skull, a dark terror rushing down his back.The German Shepard spit out a pair of wire cutters.They clattered to the ground, bits of recently cut wire still caught up in their teeth."That's not his only trick," grinned Steve as Red Skull realized that his plan was thwarted utterly again... by that Vile dog.Grabbing his energy weapon he prepared one final battle vs his Arch Nemesis and Captain Rogers.But by that moment Captain America had already picked up the dog for their famous maneuver....

"You want me to take credit, why?""Bark"

"Because I've always been a loyal friend and you just want to have a moment with Peggy?""Bark"

"You are the best dog every," stated Steve, taking the microphone in hand....Many years later

"Fury seemed upset?""How could he be upset we found Captain America!""He kept talking about Captain's might Shield.""But we found a Shield, it was a disk with a big Star on it.""Fury just said it wasn't the mighty one?""Well, there was that unexplained hole, it looked the size of a small man..."
