So what happened last night?  
  
The question snapped him out of his racing thoughts, the elation that he can basically construct reality as he sees fit within the Dwarven community still fresh in his body.You lost a buncha gold betting on fights, Orwin, you shit gambler.  
  
That was not entirely true, but only he knew what really happened.He still could taste the anxiety as he feigned intoxication the previous evening while convincing Orwin to lend a portion of his fortune he was comfortable parting with instead of wasting it on bets to the underdog.When Orwin actually agreed he didnt immediately decide to just pocket the gold - at first he was hoping to hold it until the following morning.But as morning rolled around and the realization of what it actually means to remember last night hit him he began to restructure his thoughts.Tonight was around the corner and he had a story to work on.
