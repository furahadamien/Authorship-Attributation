"I know the page number you want.14508."I looked to God expectantly.He did, I suppose, know my heart.Gingerly, the pages flicked between my fingertips as I searched for the correct page.So many years had passed, wondering.Two marriages and two divorces, too.No children because I couldn't imagine myself having them with anyone else.My heart sank when I saw your name.I would finally know.There was so much death.It was difficult to follow any alternative decisions because my life ended shortly thereafter.Every path, it seemed, was cursed."Turn to 26756."I glanced up, and he wasn't even looking at me.My attention turned back to the book; it was large enough to smell like a bookstore all by itself.I love that smell.A sigh escaped my lips as I realized where the text had taken place.It was the day I asked you to marry me.The last day we ever spoke.Unlike the rest of the book, this didn't have my alternative choice; I suppose I never had one.Instead, it was yours.What would have happened if you had said yes?Tears dripped off my chin.I don't think I stopped reading that book for days.The day you came out to your parents.The day we got married, both of us clad in white wedding dresses.The day I graduated with my doctorate degree.The day I found you convulsing after downing an entire bottle of pills.The day I had to admit you to the psychiatric ward for the fifth time.And the sixth, seventh, and eighth.It went on for thousands of pages; for every decision we made that kept our lives going, there were five where either you or I died.It was such a delicate life that we could have had together.I reached the final page of our potential lives together.Both of us sat cross-legged, foreheads touching, and a gun in hand, held to the temple of the other.Wherever you wanted to go, I followed.It was finally time.No alternative choices.I closed the book."She didn't want this life for you.""It shouldn't have been her choice."
