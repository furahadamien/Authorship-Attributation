Sorry for minor grammar errors, as I just don't care.You've found yourself standing at your front door.After saying goodbye to your loving wife and children who would soon be dropped off at daycare in downtown near your office.The lines seems to have become just another part of your daily life, hardly noticing them but still aware of both.Today the green is to the right and the red, conversely, to the left.You've lived an incredible life, every thing always comes down to the direction of these lines.Today they have seemed to switch places."The green always goes left", you think to yourself.You're so used to going left that you hardly think anything could be different if you chose to continue going left.Leaving your house and walking as you had infinite times before by turning left, walking further down the street toward your favorite coffee shop and the red line continues past it.You always have gone in the coffee shop everyday prior, but you guess a little change couldn't hurt.Continuing down the red line you start feeling a little anxious, this really hasn't followed much of the same routine that you're used to.By this time the green line would have had you at your office talking with your secretary about messages left for you.But now you're just standing at a bus stop on the other side of town.As the bus pulls up to the curb you check to see where exactly it will take you, luckily it seems that the red line has decided that you should go to the office, seeing as the sign in bright LED reads "downtown".You stay on the bus for 30 minutes or so as you pass by various ways of life.A school yard with children running and playing, thinking to yourself that life felt like it had the speed of molasses at that age, you envied them but still felt so happy that your children could experience this kind of temperament and quality of life.Continuing through streets with what looked like a farmers markets lined through and through.All those times your wife and you would walk endlessly through their maze of never ending storefronts with smiles and laughter seemingly just as endless as the time itself in those moments.But all the while on the green line, never taking a foot off of it but seemingly never having to, it always took you exactly where you needed to be.Lifting your head out of deep thought you noticed your stop was coming up.The red line was waiting for you as you get off.Walking closer to the office now the red line wants you to cross the street even though the threshold of the office was only feet ahead of you.You decided you don't need a line to make decisions for you any longer and as your right foot steps off the red line you feel free for the first time, the weight of the lines had been lifted.You turn to go inside the office as a large man exiting your office with a gun runs into you.He was mid stride and running from security, he takes one look and you and fires.You lie on the ground as the world around you seems to be getting colder, darker, and as your eyes become to heavy to keep open you can see the red line across the street leading into a daycare.
