It's the daydreaming that always gets me.I jolt awake yet the dream keeps playing on the back of my eyelids, making me wonder if I was ever asleep or if I was just thinking.I tilt my face towards the window, feeling the sun's warmth and imagining the warm orange glow that comes with it."Being on a plane must have been the worst," I say, stretching my arms out, aware of the blood flowing through them in a way I never was when I could see."One second flying towards wherever, the next totally blind with everyone else, including the pilots."I can still hear the passengers screaming in my day dream.I can hear them screaming all the way down.The Great Blinding was the darkest - literally - day in human history.Everyone crashed their cars or fell off bridges or starved to death in city parks trying to find the grocery store.Even the animals went blind, and they all died as well.All sorts of terrible shit.Almost everyone died, except those who were already blind and their immediate caretakers, lovers, family members, or whoever else happened to be in close proximity when it all happened."Imagine the smell in the factory farms," I say out loud, replaying yet another aspect of the Great Blinding back to myself.It's how I cope, going over everything that must have happened that day and during the immediate fall-out."Imagine all those turkeys suddenly blind and unfed, resorting to ferocious cannibalization before the victors died from a lack of nutrients.""Can you quit it just this once, Dan," Alice says, sounding run-down and tired."You just keep going on and on.I can't take it anymore.We've got a food run today."Her voice is soft and purpose-filled and I let it fill the room, allowing it to banish my incessant day dreaming.On that fateful day I had been helping Alice cross the street.That one altruistic deed saved my life, for Alice was already blind and for her the Great Blinding represented a minor inconvenience."Alright, Alice," I reply, standing up and feeling around for my straw hat."Hold on a second, one must always look the part these days."I smile as Alice softly chuckles in the background.I pick up the straw hat and another form of blindness hits.Objects and shapes and the bright rays of the sun blanketing everything.Sensory overload."What the...," I say, blinking rapidly.Objects come into focus.My brain re-calibrates its orientation in this world and everything comes flooding back.I see (actually see!)my warn hands holding this warn hat.My eyes are unable to cope and they sting as tears flow freely down my cheeks."What is it?"Alice asks, concerned."I can see!Alice, I can-," I stop mid-sentence, becoming aware of the words plastered all over the walls, on the table and the chair and the window sill, and even on my hat.*Don't Tell Them You Can See.*

"Tell who...," I wonder out loud, the words saturated with growing trepidation.A flash outside the window momentarily blocks the blindingly bright sun.A clamor comes from the front of the house, followed by a rapid scuffling.Alice folds herself into a corner of the room."Oh, Dan... You stupid, stupid man.""What are you taking about?What's going on?"The newfound brightness of the room sears my eyes with an intense pain."I blinded myself with a hot iron, Dan," Alice says sadly."I'm sorry."The clattering grows louder.I take a step towards the corner of the room, to where she is and where safety lies.The door creaks open and something impossible passes through, its sheer presence enveloping the room and me within it.Alice cries out, clamping down hard on her ears.A thousand voices speak from everywhere at once."You let us know.Good bye."

The perfectly straight street is lined on both sides by a row of neat little houses, each tucked behind a white picket fence."Hello, neighbor!," a man calls out, "Welcome to Heck!"My head spins.A moment ago I was lying in a hospital bed with a cocktail of drugs in my bloodstream."Huh..." I say, surprised at my own voice.I stare down at my hands, turning them back and forth."This is you, Number 665," the man says, indicating the house beside him."Thanks," I say, surprised to see a key in my hand.With a start I notice my hands aren't frail and aged.I'm young again.The inside of 665 is perfectly proportioned.One large bedroom bordering a bathroom and a kitchen/living room area, the furniture clinically placed.Everything looks like it came from a 90's Sears catalog.The house has an uncanny feeling to it.There are no bugs, no birds or frogs or squirrels.The house sits in a row on a grid that expands for miles.I biked it one day, spending six hours going straight north then east.Every house is the same, each inhabited by a single, outwardly happy individual.There are no trees.One morning a pamphlet appears on the kitchen table, just as a spoon of cornflakes is  halfway to my mouth."Welcome to Conformity (one of the seven Forgivable Sins!)."I chew on the cornflakes slowly, pondering the title, then glance at the line below."Where every day is the same!"
