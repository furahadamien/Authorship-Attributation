Loved what was written here already!Imma going to take a crack at it!--------------
In a utopian future, mankind has defeated hunger, disease and poverty.Various cities housing and feeding tens of thousands of citizens hum along with flawless efficiency.It's a world without crime.Humanity won the battle against itself.He poured a shot of vintage vodka, highly illegal.He doesn't feel a buzz.Tolerance is a bitch.He stares across the city skyline.It's also a world without passion, progression, or adventure.Humanity evolved itself into complacency.No more wars to conquer, no more discoveries, no more drive to improve.The exploration of the galaxy ended at Mars.We found an endless supply of clean energy.Our smartest and brightest used it to eradicate greed and selfishness.Somehow along the way we eradicated the human spirit as well.Quantum computers ended the PC race for more processing power.Everyone sits at home, plugged into a virtual world their great grandkids watched in movies.The mission to Jupiter and Neptune were cancelled.No reason to go.No reason for anything anymore.We lost our drive, our instincts being bred out a little more with each new generation.Dr. Eathan looked at the vial in his hand.It was the last thing humanity discovered...life on another planet.Unfortunately it was a type of virus.One that caused rapid mutations in lab tests."Time to wake up."He said softly.He would go down in history as a mass murderer and probably the first terrorist in over a century, but the alternative was far more terrifying - mankind fading into extinction.Once released, people would die.Hundreds, thousands, maybe all."Unless," he said to himself, "You lazy f**kers wake up and remember what it is to be human.To fight, survive, explore, invent, improve...The cure is on Jupiter.I've run the numbers.If they start right away, we can be there and back in enough time to save 70% of our species... And with any luck, we'll remember that we're explorers, adventurers and will keep pushing ourselves from here to edge of the galaxy."He never considered himself a villain, but maybe humanity wasn't ready for a world without conflict or without a common enemy...a common goal.Maybe someday we can be driven by pure ambition to better ourselves, but not yet.We still need a reason to push ourselves.He was going to give them purpose.If that made him the villain, so be it.
