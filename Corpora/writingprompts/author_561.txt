As I cooked my children's breakfast, my youngest came bounding up to me with a big smile on her face.She had made me my morning tea, which today smelled like ketchup and M&Ms.She had put it in my favorite mug and set it next to the stove.I turned off the gas, bent down and kissed her in the forehead.She giggled and ran off to most likely annoy her brother.I start fixing their plates and take a sip from my "#1 Dad" mug.
