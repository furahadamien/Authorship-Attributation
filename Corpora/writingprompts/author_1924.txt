My body felt weightless, until it didn't.It was like an invisible stone had been tied around my ankle and then dropped out of a plane.I had been rising before that.Hadn't I?I guess I hadn't really expected to go to that big happy factory in the sky with all the hipsters, trekkies and general goody goods .Still....I felt warm, like I was burning up on re-entry and then all at once I stopped, hanging in limbo."Welcome" said a cheery voice.I couldn't move my head to see who was speaking, and my heart was still racing from my fall."Hello, welcome", the voice said again.A Slight pink girl with bat wings and a pointed dragon's tail, came into view.She had thick framed glass that sat on the edge of her nose making her ice colored eyes bright."Name please", she chirped."Whoo..oo....muh, me?"I stammered."Yes you" she laughed.It was then I noticed the clipboard she was holding.Was that a questionnaire?Hell already seemed exactly like I thought."Trin" I cleared my throat.Trin Eugene Douglas."Hmmm", she said, "I don't see your name here, but that's alright sometimes the trip goes a little faster then our paperwork", she snorted, pleased with herself."Okay", I was worried I hadn't exactly been an upstanding citizen.I hadn't cared about the end.I thought I had a long time to wait, but at the same time people like me, well we live life faster then most I suppose.Makes sense we'd die faster... That I'd die faster.I wasn't looking forward to getting my just desserts.I had gambled on no after life, no mystical lands of judgement and retribution.I had lost."Alright" she said breaking me out of thought, "we can bypass some of the paperwork for now, After all we do have eternity".She offered a pointed grin and stared at me expectantly.I offered a small smile that seemed to satisfy her.She continued "I am Candice Batsblood, I will be your orientation leader today, please follow me".She turned on her heel and began to walk away."Um, wait!"I started.I struggled to move still unable to move stuck mid-fall."Oh right", she turned a little, back towards me and snapped her fingers.The air let me go and I dropped to the ground falling on my hands and knees."I always forget that part, come along", she began to prance away.I scrambled up and attempted to take in my surroundings.Candice lead me down a white hall.A shade I wasn't expecting to see in hell until I realized the brightness irritated my eyes.Weird maybe Hell wasn't made up of terrifying things Just little annoyances.I felt better with this thought.It was then I began sinking into the the floor.First up to the ankles and then the knees.I waded through the linoleum like it was quicksand."Ca-candice!"I tried to alert her.Candice continued spryly on top walking at a quick pace "Hurry up you slow poke" she shouted back now and again.Eventually Candice disappeared and I sunk even deeper, slowly.I tried to go back only to find the floor had returned to its normal state behind me.I was in to deep and the substance was to thick to pull myself out.The only way was forward.After what felt like hours I was up to my chest in floor and rounding the last corner to find Candice holding that large clipboard to her chest and tapping her, what I now noticed to be a hot pink cleft hoof, impatiently."Mr. Douglas, what happened to you?"This was the first time I noticed something truly devilish in her sweet, albeit strange, exterior.I could feel myself beginning to rise.She watched unblinking I as I pulled myself out of the floor, onto, well the floor.There was a vile little grin on her face,  enjoying my struggle."Please," I grunted, "Call me Trin"."Well then please call me Candice Batsblood", she replied and began checking through the pages of the clipboard once again.I lay on the floor hand on my chest panting with exhaustion.She gave a disappointed huff, "Your paperwork still has not arrived, that means we will have to place you in your circle order the old fashioned way"."Circle order?"I asked standing shakily."Yes you are here because of your misdeeds on earth, we need to figure out which misdeed you committed the least and send you to that circle.Then you travel through the rest in order of least committed to most.Your placement is usually stated in your forms".She frowned a little."You mean misdeeds like Adultery, Stealing and Murder?"I asked, chest tightening.Candice Batsblood giggled and adjusted her glasses."No silly," She turned pulling back a maroon curtain I hadn't yet noticed.It was then I realized that we were standing on a balcony overlooking a colorful land.Seven glass domes like snow globes dominated the environment, shining so brilliantly I had to shield my eyes."that's hell" she finished."What in the Heck".I gaped at the scene."Yes that's right, you are in Heck, think of it as less cruel then hell, but less "wonderful", she dropped the papers to do air quotes, "then Mediocrity, Boring's domain and Heaven, God's Domain".What was I doing here?I had committed all of the Hell related sins three times over.I felt guiltier than I ever had on earth.I always managed to justify what I did.Clearly that hadn't worked out completely for me.However, maybe things wouldn't be quite so bad.Maybe the rulers of heck didn't have to know and the paperwork wouldn't arrive.So, instead of telling Candice Batsblood the truth, I asked a question.Telling the truth had never been in my nature anyways."Okay, so if Satan rule's hell, who rule's Heck?""Gosh of course, what do they teach in religion studies now a days?""Not this", I shook my head in disbelief."I suppose this means you don't know the seven forgivable sins or the loophole".I shrugged I couldn't take this in, or believe my luck."Unlike Hell or Heaven.Mediocrity and Heck are about rising, or falling.One or two last chances, depending on which one you are in.In Heck you can rise twice or fall once.It'd be a little different if you started in Mediocrity Heavens more... reachable".Candace Batsblood still cheery, started to seem a little exasperated at my confusion."If you fail here you go to Hell to stay, if you get to Mediocrity from Heck and fail then you go to Hell.If you get through both you are absolved of your forgivable sins"

"Then heaven?""Maybe"."First we need to see which Forgivable sin you need to be forgiven of the least.There is Complaining, Teasing, Public indecency, Losing something you borrowed, Hitting and Spitting".She listed off, counting on her fingers, clipboard now under her arm and glasses askew.I smiled wryly I could do this."Its harder to pass the test, then you think", she said reading my mind."You also have to be placed first and that process without paperwork can be....difficult."I didn't care, I wasn't in Hell for whatever reason and I had a chance at something better."Alright, sign me up".I grinned truly for the first time since my death.Candice Batsbloods pink skin darkened red and ice eyes went to black "As you wish".Once again she snapped her fingers.\----------

Candice thought about her new charge after she sent him to the testing room.Something she normally would not even consider.She didn't think of Tren, just because she thought him handsome.Something had seemed, wrong.She sensed an all to familiar darkness in him.One she did not see in other humans here.It was a darkness that didn't belong.She decided to go to the record hall and try to find a paper trail.If he wasn't meant to be there it might be fun to see what chaos came about.Candice Batsblood hadn't had that kind of fun in a millennium.Besides Heck needed a change,  it was not Mediocrity after all.&#x200B;
