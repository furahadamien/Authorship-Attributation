Quick and Efficient.That's my trade.Movies always get it wrong.People fantasize about all the wrong things.They let their hatred and past injustices run wild inside their own mind because that's the only place it's permissible to feel those things.The imagination runs wild about how they get their justice, and are understood.Or at the very least, make a deadly last stand that does massive damage worthy of remembrance.Davy Crocket was never forgotten, and neither was the Alamo.These romanticizations are the cream of my crop, and I harvest them without a thought.Back Track:  

I'm not a sociopath or a psychopath.I'm not cold as ice like a gangster.Nobody hurt me to where I want to hurt others.I actually like people.I enjoy friends nights and activities.I have fun hobbies like cooking, and coffee.I like to sing.I love my wife.Yep, most laymen always get people like me wrong.Especially the ones that romanticize.People who dream of being an assassin want to kill and hurt others.Either for some warped narcissistic moral ideal, or because they're a psychopath and enjoy inflicting pain in others, or complete domination to the death.The help I receive from these people are paramount.If anyone of these people ever get the balls to actually go through with it, they'll get caught and brag about how smart they were with every little detail.Only, they obviously overlooked one thing.At least one, because they got caught.The problem wasn't their plan.I'm sure it was meticulous.It was that they were stupid enough to allow themselves the emotional satisfaction of their work.Whether it's enjoyment or even self loathing.They let themselves be emotional.They had to win.It's not about winning.You never win as an assassin.You do.It's not about emotions, and if you're emotional, don't do the job.Simple as that.For example, I don't kill kids.I can't handle that.Kids are innocent.They don't deserve a hit.If you're emotional, don't do the job.It's as simple as that.Quick and Efficient.Get in, do the job, get out.Prepare, and plan.Do a practice run or two.Stay fit, and act quick.9 times out of 10, it's going to be a complete surpise.Don't waste that element.Remember John Wick?He got his ass handed to him, and they played around with him.Then they let him live.Everyone, no matter how well trained, cannot react to an instant surprise that kills them.They should have killed him.How do I morally deal with this?My internal emotions for snuffing people out?Well.Here's the thing.It's none of my business, and as long as there is war and hatred, I'll have a job.You want to put me out of work?Love your fellow man, and just treat each other with dignity and respect.That's it.But since you can't, I'm employed.You want to learn how to be the most deadly assassin ever?It's simple.Step 1:  Stay Fit.Eat Right and Exercise.Step 2:  Be social, go out.Have fun.Enjoy your life.Step 3:  Have an actual job.The IRS needs a reason for you having money anyway, and it's good to stay busy.Step 4:  Never kill anyone you know.You can punch them if they screw with you.But don't kill them.In fact, don't kill anyone within 50 miles of you.Seriously, if you drive an hour, nobody will know.50 is good.Step 5:  Steps 3 and 4 together.Just be a normal person.Wear normal inconspicuous clothing.Keep your hair trimmed.Etc.(Can you tell that by mentioning this three times in three separate rules, it's kind of important.)Step 7:  Accepting the job.Step 8:  Prepare.Know the target.Have a plan.Carry it out.Leave.Step 9:  Don't save anything that was used in the murder.Not your clothes.Your car.Anything.It all gets thrown away or dismissed.For example, the car.Traffic cameras can follow your car away from a crime scene.It's not rocket science.After the job, you have to disappear without leaving any leads.So everything you use, you get rid of.Step 10:  Forget!This is important because most people can't do this tiny simple thing.Have you ever had a bad or hard day at work.You get home, wind down a bit, and forget.You have to do the same thing after you finish a job.Sure, it can be a rush, but that's an emotion.You've got to let it go.Let it go Elsa.Step 11:  Go back to living your normal life.Go back to work.Nobody will be the wiser.You'll never be questioned about it later if you did your job right.You're a ghost.We can discuss logistics later, but that's basically the mindset you have to have if you want to survive in this trade.Oh, by the way.That's a trade-off that you make to work in this industry.Understand that if you kill someone, your life is forfeit.You may get caught.You may live.You might survive to old age.But when you kill someone, for whatever reason, you're making the conscious decision to trade your life for theirs.Whether it's death, life in prison, or whatever.That's the trade that you make.Sure, you might never have to pay the piper.But you should damn well be aware of the price.Then be OK with it.At peace.It might be worth it too.Imagine someone killed your entire family.Would your life be worth it to make them pay?Vengeance is a powerful motivator.Sure, you'll get caught.It's an emotion.But would it be worth it?I think so.As for me, a payday every now and again is worth the trade.I'm not really worth much, and when you step back and look at the world.It's pretty obvious.Life is cheap.On the flipside, it does give me a little peace of mind to know that most people with the ambition to become an assassin have absolutely no idea how to get a client.
