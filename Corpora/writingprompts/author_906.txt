It happened again.The first time it happened, I nearly freaked.In fact, I did freak.I thought I was losing my mind.My grip on reality teetered on the edge of insanity.Fortunately for me, I've always been curious by nature.If I was going insane, then so be it.Despite my fear, that deep-rooted curiosity of mine got the better of me.It was like nothing I had ever experienced.Cautious, though I was, I took a step, and then another.And then another.Everywhere I looked, things appeared to have stopped.As I passed a man drinking from a water-fountain, I ran my palm right through the water intended for his mouth.He made no movements.My hand sliced through the water.What the hell was going on?The man stared blankly at the water in his hunched over position, arms at his side.I had no desire to cause any harm, but again, I was curious.I gave the man the slightest of shoves.Had I pushed harder, the man would have fallen just as he was.Still, he made no movements.Was I dreaming?Was I dead?I frantically searched my backpack for my phone.The clock hands on the screen no longer moved.I fixated on the clock, waiting patiently.Nothing.I tried again, this time counting to 60.And still, nothing.WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?A sudden thought crept into my mind.Had time stopped?The world around me had ceased all movement, and yet I could still do as I please.Something wasn't right here.If time stopped, why had I not stopped with it?My mind raced, and as my mind raced, my legs picked up the cue.I ran, and I ran, and I ran.I stopped at every single person I came across.I lightly nudged each and every one of them.I ran through the park.Animals stood frozen like statues.Dogs, birds, squirrels, even the ants.Nothing.There was no movement.The sun maintained it's current position.Any wind that had previously existed ceased.______________________________________________________

I awoke to the all too familiar sound of nothingness.I reached for a pen by my nightstand and made a mark on the wall.246.This had happened 246 times.It still did not cease to surprise me whenever it happened, though the astonishment wore off more easily now.There was a time in the first 100 instances that I had even thought that I was the one causing time to stop.ME!I tried and tried to create an instance of my own doing, but after painstaking efforts and countless days, I gave up.I thought maybe it was some kind of power buried deep within me that I hadn't learned to access yet.That was all of course before I saw him.
