"He wants to roam the world  
leap across new grounds and fields  
you cannot hold him here, dear  
he wants to see it all."With a silent look and quiet eyes  
Lucifer looked towards his lover,  
"I know he has to go ...bbut  
can't he stay, stay for some time more?You have not seen what I have  
the world out there is a nightmare  
they fear what they cannot identify  
run away scared, or kill it on sight."Now, calmer, he looked at her again,  
"I know, I know, I know  
that it's also the most beautiful  
but who would guide him there?"The next day Lucifer found a letter  
asking him, begging him for a pony  
"Must be a mistake," he thought,  
but re-reading the name there was no doubt.He folded the paper back  
went and found a small box  
there he wrote with pen on paper  
"Take care of him, he's a bit shy."The black velvet shining in the light  
and dark eyes hopeful of a new time  
the horse which couldn't even heat water  
is now breathing fire, ready to go beyond."Take care of yourself, old buddy  
be careful, be brave, but also be open in your heart."With a rub on the head and pat on the neck,  
Lucifer bid his sister's last horse goodbye.Snow falling, winds navigating around the walls  
the door opened, a man walked out  
and to his wonder found, that in his yard  
stood a magnificent and beautiful black horse."Is he breathing fire?No that can't be right  
it surely must be an illusion of my mind."He stepped on a box then picked it up  
two letters inside, he opened each one up.The first one read :  
'He has mastered bending fire and can teach you too  
but, Take care of him, he's a bit shy.From Satan'

And the second :  
'Dearest Satan,  
I love you!!!I am 5 year old now  
and have been very good.Can you please please send me a pony?I will love her and share my food.Please!!!Thank Yu
