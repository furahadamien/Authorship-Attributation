She looked thin, an average girl, she shifted her weight as her high heel strap dug uncomfortably into the back of her ankle.She bent down to readjust the strap.My mind was racing and I could feel my body become aware of that I knew nothing about the situation about to enfold between us.Thin soft curls covered her eyes as she rose to meet my widened stare.She instantly knew I could tell she was different, our eyes locked and I felt every fear and trepidation pass from me.She smiled, her face softening as she seemed to download every thing I've ever felt seen or heard."Danny," she whispered, although I don't remember her mouth moving, "I'm tired, I've been on a century shift and I just want to have some fun."I let her pass through.Honestly something about her absolutely terrified me even though I felt a calm blanket surrounding my physical body.She made me feel like I was standing in front of the biggest mountain or tree Id ever seen.A small part of me wanted to fall to my knees and pray to her to spare me from whatever she was capable of if pushed to wrath.I didn't though, I just numbly went through the rest of the night.Anxiously peeking in to see if I could tell what she was doing.At closing time she walked out following a regular I'd seen many times.A tall guy that brought many girls to the club and none of them looked to happy to be leaving with him after.Id heard he was a bad guy, a date raper, machismo bully and so on.This time her stride was confident, her eyes locked on the back of his head as she trailed him like a coyote.She winked at me as she strode by."Bonus" she whispered.As they walked away my guts twisted into knots as I observed the guys number start to tick down.
