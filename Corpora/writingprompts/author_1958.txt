Hey!Hey, stop!What do you mean youre safe now? I cried to the retreating back of the trenchcoated man who had just shot my wallet, which lay smoking on the damp alley floor.You cant just walk away from me, you know!

He kept walking.Scooping up the tattered remains of my wallet, I shook off the shock of what had just happened and jogged after him.It didnt take long to catch up.Explain.Now, I growled, gripping the mans arm.The flesh beneath my fingers was squashy and I spied a little roll of soft podge over the waistband of his suit trousers, he couldnt start shit.My grip tightened.What *the fuck* was that.

The man regarded me, unblinking and with no hint of fear in his eyes.He merely raised one sharply arched brow and cocked his head to the side.For someone whose life I just saved, I must admit I expected a touch more gratitude. His voice was cool and measured, deep but not gravelly.How can I be grateful when I *dont know what the fuck is going on*? I snapped, giving him a rough shake and brandishing the ruined wallet in front of his nose.This was a gift from my grandfather, how could it put me in danger?

The faintest hint of a smirk ghosted across the mans lips.So, you really dont know, huh, she was right then, he murmured, to himself more than me.Thoughts, emotions flickered across his face in quick succession as he tried to decide what to do with this new piece of information.Information, it seemed, he had not counted on appearing.He straightened and brushed my hand from his arm.I let my hand fall limply to my side, the anger had dissipated only to be replaced by confusion.Rolling his shoulders and adjusting his coat, he looked me over.His mouth twisted and his nostrils flared ever so slightly.Apparently coming to a decision, the man sighed, pinched the bridge of his nose.I hate to tell you this, sweetheart, but your grandfather wants you dead.
