'My teeth hurt, but at least we've got loads of money' said Louise.'Oh shit' muttered, Kathy.'What?'asked Louise.'You remember those vr goggles I had for my 10th birthday?''The ones that you tried on and thought were dumb?''Yeah.Turns out, I never actually took them off.''Shit!''I know right?I guess this is goodbye forever.''Yeah okay.Bye love.'Kathy removed the vr glasses and found herself in her bedroom, still ten years old.She'd lived an entire lifetime as the first ever lesbian car saleswoman to also invent a new type of fire extinguisher.It was a proud life, one that seemed somehow unbelievable, which it was, because it was vr.&#x200B;

Kathy's mum came in.'Awwww did you enjoy your lickle wickle game my sweet pudding pot?''Shut up, mum.I hit you with my car when I was working at the dealership, and I'll do it again.'Kathy's mum gasped like a jilted telenovela star.What had happened to her precious daughter?They fought viciously.'What has this game done to you!?'Kathy's mum bellowed emotionally.She grabbed the vr goggles off her daughter's head, pulled the elastic strap round her head, and immediately fell to the floor.Kathy's mum couldn't believe it.She was Kathy, 60 years old, sitting with her partner Louise, of roughly about the same age, in a country house in the English countryside.It looked like something from a catalogue.In a frame above the fireplace was an oil painting of Kathy, holding a fire extinguisher, wearing a medal, and sitting on the boot of a Porsche SUV.Above it was the stuffed head of a deer.Kathy's mum tried to let out a diva-ish scream and pull the goggles from her eyes.But it was no use.She was immediately trapped; stuck in the 'Being John Malkovich'-esque nightmare, cemented and frozen, as Louise poked at her aching teeth, making banal comments about the sensation and appearance of them, for all eternity.When Kathy's mum finally learned to speak through the VR representation of her elderly daughter Kathy, after what must have been at least 50 years, she asked Louise why time had stood still and no events were changing in this VR world.Louise seemed slightly taken aback.She leaned forward and offered a small smile.'You're in hell'.Kathy's mum roared, fell to her knees in front of the painting, sinking below the waves of confusing existential pain, agonised.'Louise poked a filling on one of her back teeth and let out a small burp.&#x200B;

Kathy stood next to her screaming mother in the real world.Kathy had smashed the vr glasses whilst they were over Kathy's mum's face, causing the sensation of time to become forever vanished for her.Kathy fixed the glasses permanently to her mother's eyes and restrained her body with gaffa tape.&#x200B;

'No one fucks with Kathy Spence.Entrepreneur, Health and Safety visionary.'She laughed to herself, and then paused.'But that life's over now.'Kathy turned to face the door.'Im gonna change my name and become a legendary pop singer.Her name will be... Whitney Houston'.&#x200B;

Don't mess with Kathy.&#x200B;
