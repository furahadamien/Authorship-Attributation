Monday.If they weren't bad enough, the drive to work was about to make today much worse.'Manuel, there's still hope.You can always put them down'.'Shut up and drive' , I retorted.God, even my car was judging me.Bad enough these things advertise things I'll never buy, now they're parenting me too.*Flick* 'FUCK!', I barked.I was running low on fluid, and would have to buy some soon.*Flick* 'Seven more minutes until we reach our destination', my car had a sick sense of humor.It was always at the 7 minute mark that it felt the need to remind me of: How much time left until the slog of work...and..wait for it...'Did you know you Qualify for the NHA program: Stop Smoking Now, quit today Manuel, add an addition 10 years to your life today!'My car was a shit comedian.Or a sadist.Either way there were only a couple minutes until my trip was over and I hadn't even tasted the air of my Menths yet.'Fuuuuuuuck..c'mon', I moaned.This time *con huevos* I thought.*FLICK*
  Finally.'Thank fucking God', I said as I pointed skyward.The bright orange always got my heart racing.Like a girl you convince to come over, that orange burn is like her taking her pants off...slowly.The best is about to come..as she slowly starts to..'HEALTH WARNING: IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO QUIT, SAVE YOURSELF MANUEL Y.., You've arrived at your destination' said the talking piece of shit.My car and I had one thing in common.When things were getting good, we'd always say something to ruin the mood.'To hell with it, I've earned this', I said.I had to say it.I'm going to smoke this.This fucking car is going to sit here and watch me smoke this.As the warmth of the orange glistened on the the cigarette, the feeling of the satisfaction started to flow through my body.**Inhale** finally.FINALLY.Thank God, I thought, this stupid car and these stupid ads.'Fuck em', I spoke softly as I exhaled.I was going to be ten minutes late but it didn't matter.I didn't like my job, my coworkers nor my car and here I was.Smoking a cigarette in the parking lot feeling as if I had finished a marathon.My shirt, my hair and my hands would be covered in the smell, but I didn't care.I had my smoke, and I'd be off in eight hours.'Time to go' I mumbled as I flicked the butt out the window.*Sigh*
