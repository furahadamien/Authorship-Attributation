Economic crash.Drought.Starvation.When people were suffering, they needed someone to blame.How could someone be so lucky as to have a large successful crop when many others had farms full of diseased, dying plants?How could someone make so much money and lose so little when the economy crashed?How could someone be lucky enough to find an underground spring on their land, when water shortages were rife elsewhere?When so many babies were dying, how could one live and be healthy after so many complications from the pregnancy?If these people are so lucky, why do those around them suffer?Why aren't they sharing their luck with everyone else?The world is just collateral damage for these people, when they succeed others fail.Lock them away, keep the world safe from their influence.If they aren't getting the luck, others will get a share of the benefits.Don't be lucky.Be careful.Don't be too clever or take risks, your success will be called "luck".And if your baby survives impossible odds, weep, for they will never see freedom.
