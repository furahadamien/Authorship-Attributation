Waking up was a surprise.That much was clear from the expression on his face.I put the stick back on the ground slowly.My friend still lived.But something had changed.He stood up quickly, head swiveling round and round.Silence.I tried talking to him and he signaled for silence.After a few minutes he slowly sat back down and stared at me.And, somehow, through me."I have seen the land beyond this."That was... what?He gripped my shoulders and shook me."Come... there is much to do."The next few days went fast.He challenged and won the contest of battle for head of our tribe.How, I don't know.No one had ever fought like he did.Like a snake and a lion combined.What we did next we barely understood.But soon our tribe had 'homes'.And food in abundance.A wall for protection.But this was only the beginning.Over the next summers things progressed rapidly.Our tribe grew.Our thoughts grew sharper.We had tools of hard earth and fire.They made us stronger, quicker, healthier.We moved, closer to the water.We learned of the food from the sea.And of boats.Many things.A city grew.Many homes.Many of us.All working as one.We learned to write, and to math, and to bring the imaginary to reality.His thoughts, his ambitions, were always bigger than ours.He would speak of the next land, of how every tribe would have their own city like ours one day.We would gather people to ours.To grow strong as one.Atlantis.That is what he called our place.Only this time it would be real, with high unfloodable walls.An unending center of civilization for the world.That is what he said.I did not know what he meant.I could only see the next step and not the whole journey.Neither of us would live long enough to see that he was wrong.
