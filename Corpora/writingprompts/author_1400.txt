Death often found themselves reminiscing about those times.Work had been easy and plentiful.Their ears fluttered when someones end was
near, they quickly flew over, and before the victim knew it their soul was now in the
possession of the Repear himself.He often complained that there was too much
work for the little time he had in his days.Now, he wished he could do anything to take back those words.Nuclear annihilation had been a constant threat to humanity
for almost a century at that point.All it would take for one insane leader or one
desperate dictator to set them off and kill the world.Ironically, the world was
at its highest level of peace on a millennium when it happened.But humans are
not perfect, and just the slightest error in missiles code could give a
completely different command then planned.Unfortunately, other countries did
not forgive that mistake.When the ash settled and the humans finally crawled out of their
vaults, 1,220 human were still left on the planet Earth.At first death simply continued as normal.Someone attacked by
mutants?Wait for the inevitable.A man fighting off scavengers?See who would
win.He was sure that humans would eventually jump over the hurdles and
repopulate the planet.Maybe the job would even be manageable now, he smugly
chucked to himself.That was the plan at least.Death realized more and more how fragile of a species
humanity is.When necessities are nearly non-existent and the environment is this
hostile, humans are completely defenseless.Every year their population would plummet
by 100 until there were only 300 left.Death began to worry.God told him that
if humanity were to ever fade, he would with them.What if he kept true to his
word?Death would have no other choice.It was a women with their two children.They had been
huddled in the shelter for three days, starving.There was no more food left,
and their life from their eyes was draining by the second.Well, this was a better time than ever.Materializing in front of a human for the time in his career,
he reached out and offered them a loaf of bread.Making part two now.
