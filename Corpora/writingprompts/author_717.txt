It all started with a fortune teller on international TV.Apparently she'd made some crazy claims, like, abnormally crazy.But people decided to finally listen to her after her 50-something-th correct prediction in a row, and good thing it was now too.The prediction this time was for global apocalypse.She described a vast, stretching and totally barren wasteland, with no warmth or happiness.&#x200B;

Nothing.&#x200B;

Apparently this idea was romantic enough to send the whole world into a frenzy, with people trying to find a way to slow it down, even stop it entirely.No one was sane anymore and society fell apart fast, it even looked like everyone would kill each other before this so called 'apocalypse' at one point.It was at that point that I found it, I knew this was humanity's last chance and that it was my responsibility to give it to them.The knife which sent people to the other side, a sort of 'eden' to contrast the approaching armageddon, the only way to save them.Except, no one would believe me.Why would they?The end of the world is coming and the one who convinced us it was is now saying there's no hope, people are making the best out of the lives they have left, which made my job easier than it should have been.I killed 12 in the first day, my conscience couldn't handle the idea of killing others, even if it's for their own good.I threw up 7 times that day and, at one point, I was so weak from the shock that one of my targets actually overpowered me and ran away.It didn't take long to get easier, after the first week I was working through 30 people a day, and I just became more proficient after each one.After a while I'd cleared out the town I was in at the time, I became a wandering hermit of sorts.Moving from town to town, only leaving once I'd cleared out the area.I'd take some supplies and move on to the next town, quietly and efficiently

I started learning to scope out the people I saved for a little while, it made the actual event easier and quicker.People rarely acted out of suit for this new culture we'd built ourselves, but after a while, I'd noticed something had changed.People were smiling again, and not like the fake smiles they put on because they didn't know what else to do, the looked normal.A few towns over from that realisation I noticed a postman, a real postman doing a real job.I thought nothing of it at the time, simply people holding to old traditions and trying to jump-start society again, despite how meaningless it is.I moved between places so quickly at this point I barely even cared to look at my surroundings, I had internalised my process to such a level that I rarely even had to think anymore.All that kept me going was the promise that I would save them all, and then join them on the other side.It came as a surprise, then, when I realised that I was currently following the last two humans on earth.My pace picked up and I slammed into the man's back and sent my dagger through the back of his neck, I stood up and turned to the woman only to pause for just long enough for her to get out of reach.It was the fortune teller, she'd been alive all this time, running from me.She didn't say anything as my knife plunged into her chest and she slumped to the floor.I just stood there, shocked.Shocked that it was all over, that they were finally all saved.The haze in my mind lifted as I looked up to the world for the first time in years.What I saw was a vast, stretching and totally barren wasteland, with no warmth or happiness.&#x200B;

Just me.&#x200B;
