It was supposed to be an honor.Instead, it was a prison.The first time had been just like giving blood - a small prick, wait for a few seconds, and it was all done.Nothing to it, except I stubbed my toe on the way out.That had been more pain than I had ever felt before.Now I was used to it - it was an everyday occurrence here.They didn't even bother watching over us most of the time.I don't know how they kept new "prospectives", as they called them, from getting lucky and stumbling across us.I suppose that just would have been too lucky for our current selves.The one piece of "luck" permitted to us was the monthly thank-you video from the President.I wish he had died in the womb like he was supposed to.Instead, he got to be the luckiest man alive, while I was stuck here in this cell.We were treated well enough, true - couldn't have the President's precious supply of luck rotting away - but we weren't allowed any freedom.0900 - Breakfast.Always oatmeal.0930 - Back to our padded cells.Couldn't risk anyone getting seriously injured, could we?1000 - First exercise shift, 1 hour.Always under close supervision to keep the precious livestock safe.1100 - Second exercise shift, 1 hour.If you got assigned this one, you ate lunch late.1200 - First lunch, 30 minutes.Always lukewarm soup.1230 - Second lunch, 30 minutes.First lunchers were back to their cells.1300 - Second lunchers back to their cells.1800 - Dinner.We used to get de-boned chicken, but ever since someone got sick we've gotten potatoes.I hated every minute of it.We weren't even allowed books, for fear of papercutting ourselves to death.Just the same 7 walls, for days on end.At least the ground was comfortable.Sleeping was the best way to deal with it anyway.BZZT!The sound of a buzzer and a flash of red light from right outside my cell bring me back to the present.It must be Tuesday.They always drained me on Tuesdays.I push myself slowly off the floor as the door folds back to reveal an officer.She beckons me forward, and I follow her.I'd learned early on it was no use resisting.We walk at a slow, controlled pace over to the elevator, where she boards first.We rise slowly, and eventually reach the draining floor.As I exit the elevator and round the corner, I bump into someone.My head down, I mumble a quick "sorry" and scoot past, hoping to avoid a scene with a recently drained inmate.To my surprise, I get back a cheerful, "That's okay!Do you know where room A221 is?I'm supposed to be there in 5 minutes for my donation appointment!"I  turn, a smile already beginning to show on my lips.Today just might be my lucky day.
