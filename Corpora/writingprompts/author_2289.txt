First story, please share any feedback you have so I can improve my story telling.Thank you!Stella was at the bank, she had recently inherited two grand from her mum who passed away.She was going to make her mother proud by investing the money into an education so she could support herself.First she needed to discuss with a Teller about her financial plans to help her achieve her goal.She was just about to approach one when the heavy glass doors flung open.Two armed men in suits wearing pig masks busted in.The security guard at the door tried to stop them but was down on the ground instantly with two well placed shots to his head.Stella froze, she was to stunned to do anything.One of the men approached her and ordered her to get down on the floor while aiming his weapon at her face.To stunned to do anything she just stared at the man with a blank expression.Taking matters into his own hands, he grabbed her hair and threw her down himself.She let out a squeal when she hit the ground and started whimpering.Her head was throbbing and she could feel a warm liquid flowing down the side of her face.The man decided he wanted a hostage and that Stella would fit that role perfectly.He grabbed her by the hair again and lifted her to her feet."Whats your name sweetheart?", asked the man.Stella managed to respond with a silent "Stella".This time the man froze with what looked like fear.He then demanded to know her last name.When she revealed her last name, the man's let go of her hair and slowly started backing away.He then called out to his partner that they need to leave right now.The partner responded with a puzzled look.The man signalled towards Stella.He followed up by announcing her name was on the "no harm" list.The partner paused immediately, comprehending what the man had said.When it finally clicked in his brain he blurted out an "oh we're fucked" and bolted for door.The man took one last look at Stella before he bolted for the door.She started wobbling before passing out and hitting the floor again.When she opened her eyes, she was greeted by a face that she could never forget.The distinct features like the icy blue eyes it possessed or the sharp extended chin that housed the most chilling smile."Hello Stella, it's been a long time, hasn't it?.She felt chills run down her spine, it was like experiencing chalk and nails scratching a blackboard."It has been Richard, and I intend to keep it that way".His smile slowly transformed into a glare which could make anyone crumbled to their knees."I would be careful what you say, after all you are in debt to me.I did just save you from an interrogation with the police".Talking to him was like defusing a bomb, if she didn't do this correctly she would end up making him explode in to a rage."You're right Richard, I should be more appreciative".His smile came back."let me show you something Stella, I think you will like it".They walked into a room.It was grey and plain with four metal chairs bolted to the ground, two were already occupied."Please take a seat Stella".She sat down and stared directly at the two others who were already sitting.They're hands were tied to the chairs and they had burlap sacks over their heads.Richard pull the sacks of revealing the men's faces.They were covered in cuts and bruises.Richard than looked back to Stella "Who was the one that grabbed you?", he questioned.Stella squinted to get a better look but they were wearing masks so how could she tell?"I don't know, they were both wearing masks Richard".Richard's smile dropped again and he gave Stella another one of those glares."Pick one Stella or I am going to kill both of them".The room suddenly went cold.The silence was broken, "It was me boss, I was the one.I didn't realise it was her though, please don't kill me.I have family back home".He looked so weak now, like a puppy that had been left to defend itself.Richard didn't flinch, this was a man that felt no empathy.He slipped his hand into his coat and pulled it back out holding his weapon of choice.Slowly, he placed the end of the barrel on the man's forehead.Richard loved the feeling of having power over someone.Nothing quite gave him the excitement of torturing someone before he killed them.Richard looked the man square in his eyes.Blood sprayed out the back of the man's head.Richard than turned to the man's partner."You're are going to deliver the body to his family back home" he ordered.Stella was paralysed again, she wished she never visited the bank today.
