I chuckle to myself.Meta.Cute.

But something was different about today.For the first time in years I was home with family on Christmas.Whatever home is.Its weird to think how things have changed in the three years since I made an account.Theres usernames I recognize, some friends I have.But nothing has been able to shake that feeling of dread, loneliness.Love, acceptance, those words might as well be foreign to me.At the same time, Reddits always been there.Suicide attempts, break-ups, moves, road trips, when I got out of the its always been somewhere for me to run away to.Ive seen a lot of bad on Reddit, but a lot of good too.Thnx, man.Means a lot.

Five words, but they hide a lot of experience and a lot of pain.Christmas dont mean as much anymore to me anymore.The holidays are jus days now.Its scary being around family.Being alone is safe to me, if not helpful long-term.Nah, really.I appreciate it.
