When I was a kid, I thought winning a lifetime supply of Oreos would mean truck after truck appearing at my house, each overflowing with Oreos.Back then I didn't think about things like where in the world we'd keep that many Oreos, or the fact that they'd all go bad shortly after, or that sooner or later I'd get sick of eating them.I just had this grand vision in my head I guess, didn't want to let it go.So I was pretty disappointed when a little package showed up on our front porch.There were fifteen Oreos in the package.I asked my mom where the rest was, and she told me more would come next month.Waiting an entire month seemed like torture at that age, and made what arrived doubly crushing.Another package of exactly fifteen Oreos.It slowly sunk in to my little head that this was what winning a lifetime supply of Oreos looked like.No trumpets and fanfare, no overloaded trucks pulling in one after another.Just a little packet of fifteen Oreos on the first of every month.Fifteen!I couldn't believe it.That wasn't even one Oreo for each day!The grand imaginings we have as kids rarely come true.For example, I wanted to be a marine biologist.Then the whole world started collapsing and now there are hardly any fish even left, much less people with the time or tools to study them.And yet, those packages kept coming.To my house.To the shelter.To my tent.To the stick laid against a tree with an old coat draped over it so I could huddle under, away from the worst of the rain.Wherever I went, there they were.Fresh and neatly packaged up on the first of every month, like nothing bad had ever happened anywhere.For a long time I tried to figure out where they were coming from, who delivered them, how they were finding me, anything.I ran after every lead, pursued every theory.Aliens?Fairies?Time travel?Some bizarre joke?All in my head?But I never found anything, and eventually I gave up on finding out.I didn't want to finally get my answer only to realize it was like everything else- Like the trucks of Oreos, like undersea exploration, like falling in love.Something that seemed to exist just to disappoint people naive enough to believe in it.Today was the first of the month, I'd guess.Haven't had a calendar for a long time, but the deliveries never fail.This time the package was placed neatly across a few sturdy branches of the tree I'd slept in, hoping to avoid the mess of trouble that had gone on below.I wasn't sure how I'd get down considering I'd messed up one of my legs pretty darn badly in the night's scuffle, but my package was close enough to reach from where I sat.Same little shipping label as always, though the address lines had been left blank since I stopped having an address.I opened it up.You think I'd be sick of them by now, but when times are rough you wouldn't believe how good that sugar tastes.Only, strange thing, there weren't so many in the package this time.Five was all, I was ten short.I considered that maybe wherever they came from was running out, or that something else had gotten to my supply before I had.Then I considered something else.A lifetime supply of Oreos.I guess this is my last one.
