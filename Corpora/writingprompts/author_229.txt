On the day of The Great Blinding, I wasn't doing anything special.I had just been out on a grocery run after everything in the fridge had mysteriously spoiled, even though it had been fine the day before.I guess I should've stopped and thought about what the hell happened, even if just for a few minutes.Well, it wouldn't have mattered whether I had stopped to think about perfectly good food suddenly rotting overnight in the fridge.If I had paused that day, maybe I would've ended up dead.After all, suddenly losing your sight while you're in the middle of driving to the store is quite shocking.I remember the moment it had happened clearly as if it wasn't something that happened years ago.Maybe it's because that had been the very last thing Id ever seen.I had just picked up a carton of eggs when suddenly, the lights started flickering.I thought nothing of it at the time since it was very windy outside.Then after mere seconds of flickering lights, everything seemed to go back to normal.Oh the storm must be dying down a bit I had thought before placing the carton of eggs in my trolley.Or at least, I tried to put them in my cart.Because at that exact moment, everything went dark.I couldn't even see the light filtering in from the windows.And the carton that was in my hands had been dropped from pure shock as everyone, including myself, screamed.Maybe it was because everyone else was screaming that I joined in.I wasn't particularly scared, it was probably just stormy outdoors.Maybe it had even gotten cloudy while I was shopping.Though, from everything strange happening lately, I knew deep down something had gone wrong.I just didn't want to admit it.That had happened two years ago.And when my sight suddenly came back, the first thing I came face to face with was a brick wall that said Dont tell them you can see.But I still didn't know who them was.The streets were completely empty.Which seemed odd....just seconds ago I could hear people chatting as they went about their day.Now there wasn't a single person in sight.And I didn't dare to turn around to look for anyone else.I was too scared to let anyone know that I could see now.Apparently.Then, I continued walking making sure to keep going about my day as if nothing had happened.Like I had just forgotten what I was doing for a moment.And as I continued moving forward, I took in my surroundings.Everything seemed so...lifeless and dull.What had happened two years ago?As I rounded a corner, I immediately saw something different but I pretended not to be shocked.Thank God for all those acting lessons I had gotten before The Great Blinding.But what stood before me was what I could only describe as a monster.Whatever the hell it was, towered so high above me I couldn't see what I assumed to be its head.The monster itself had thin limbs -- so thin it was really just skin stretched over bones and joints.And this thing had pitch-black skin to top it all off.What a creepy aesthetic.Even for a monster.I kept on walking, hoping this thing wouldnt notice anything strange about me.But just as I was about to walk past it, the damn thing froze right in its tracks.And in an eerie, ghostly voice I heard it talk.I smell the fear of a visionary. 

And just as I began to walk right past it.Everything went dark for the second time in my life.I suddenly sat up on a way too uncomfortable sofa.Sweat training down my face as I saw a beat-up looking room.Torn posters covered one of the walls, all of which had wallpaper peeling off of them.And not to mention how the room was so damn dark.Hey, look whos finally awake,  a voice said.I turned to see a tired-looking man with dirty blonde hair looking at me with a small smile.Welcome to the rebellion.
