SmittyFromAbove
Jimmy had never been a normal kid, he figured this out early on in life because he never seemed to look at things the same way other kids did.Jimmy used to sit and read books while other children played because he felt what they were doing was a waste of time, while what he was doing was enriching his knowledge, and if Jimmy knew anything he knew knowledge was power.You see power was extremely valuable to Jimmy because in many parts of his life he found himself lacking just that.He hated feeling powerless when the other kids picked on him for being different.Jimmy could take the mean words and insults they threw at him but eventually, words turned into fists and insults turned into rocks.Jimmy was at what he called a pivotal turning point in his life, he was about to start highschool and leave behind all the people who tormented him.Jimmy though highschool was a place where he would finally gain acceptance for his high intellect, something he had sorely missed throughout his younger years.Jimmy's parents were very concerned about their son, concerned about the fact he was always coming home with cuts and bruises, things Jimmy would attempt to explain away as from playing sports.They always knew Jimmy was different as well, but they understood that things were not about to get better for their son, no they knew things were about to get much worse.It was September 5th in Jimmy's sleepy little town where the bristle of fall and the new school year was in the air.Jimmy had gotten up early this morning to sit by his window and watch the leaves dance through the air which seemed almost melodic compared to rapid thoughts shooting through his mind.Jimmy was nervous and excited at the same time, nervous because he didn't know quite what to expect and excited to finally reinvent himself.He was lost deep in thought when he saw a tiny spider struggling to escape out his open window.A normal person would have swatted that spider right then and there, but again Jimmy was never known for being normal.In fact, Jimmy had a history of always helping out small and defenseless things, he thought perhaps because they were akin to himself.So as Jimmy always did he helped the little spider onto his hand and onto the window sill.The spider skittered away but at the last second did a 180 and seemed to look up at Jimmy as if to thank him before disappearing over the window sill.Jimmy's first day began promisingly enough when he was able to find all of his classes without trouble and found himself left alone, he had even made small talk with a few classmates.Everything was going good until he was walking through the halls on the way to his last class of the day when he spotted him, Gary Daniels, the bully who terrorized him for years in elementary school.Jimmy felt himself go numb at the sight of him because Jimmy had thought Gary had been held back a year.He realized Gary must have completed summer school and been able to squeeze by with a pass.Jimmy with his arm full of books slowly walked by hoping Gary wouldnt recognize him.Jimmy was almost by him when all of a sudden Gary spun around and slapped Jimmy's books out of his hand screeching, "Look who it is little Jimmy the dimmy (as far as nicknames go Gary wasnt very resourceful), I can't believe they let a loser, weirdo like you into this school."Jimmy froze up not sure what to do, by now a small crowd has started to form around them which only seemed to egg Gary on."I think its finally time to teach this weirdo a thing or two about being normal, I'll be waiting for you after the final bell Dimmy, waiting for you in the forest behind the school, and if you dont show up I will make your every day of school this year a living hell!"By now Jimmy was completely red faced and didn't know what to do.Thankfully he was saved when the bell rang."Ill see you soon Dimmy dont make me come looking for you," Gary taunted as he sauntered away.Jimmy collected his books and continued onto his last class where his mind was racing a mile a minute.Pretty soon Jimmy had made himself sick to his stomach with his overactive imagination of how the encounter after school would end.He thought maybe if he snuck away Gary would forget about it but he remembered that Gary had always kept up his promise to hurt Jimmy in the past.The last class flew by too fast and before he realized the time the final bell had rang sending anxiety shooting through his body with every ring.In elementary school when Gary would pick on him normally there was only a few kids around but as Jimmy walked into the forest he was surprised to see half of the school waiting for him."Ah look who decided to show up, little Dimmy with his stupid little face, I hope your ready for the beating of a lifetime."Jimmy tried to protest, "Please Gary I dont want any problems I just want to be left alone."But Jimmy's protests fell on deaf ears...Gary moved in and shoved Jimmy hard to the ground."Come on get up loser, face me like a man," Gary yelled as he grabbed Jimmy by the shirt and pulled him up.The crowd was laughing and egging Gary on at this point, "Punch him in his big fat nose," one kid yelled."Listen I will make you a deal, if you get down right now and kiss my shoes I will let you leave without a beating, but for every second you stand there looking stupid Im going to slap you like a bitch."Now Jimmy didnt have a lot of pride but what little pride he had left wouldn't let him get down on his knees and kiss his sworn enemies shoes.So enticed by Jimmy's silence and refusal to bend to his request Gary nor the crowd noticed the thousands of little black specks descending from the trees above.But Jimmy noticed, in fact it was the one thing he focused in-between the slaps so he wouldn't burst out crying.All of a sudden the tiny specks started to land on the crowd including Gary, but no one seemed to notice at first.That was until the first scream rang out throughout the forest.By then it was too late, thousands of what appeared to be spiders had descended upon the mob of people swarming over everyone except Jimmy.The screams intensified even more as the spiders entered every orifice of every person in that forest virtually liquefying the insides of them all.Eventually, one by one every student in the forest went silent dropping to the ground only to be engulfed by a large black mass.Jimmy could only stand there dumbfounded, slightly afraid he was to be next.Jimmy looked down at his hand to see a familiar friend, it was the spider he had released out his window that same morning.In that moment Jimmy realized something special had just happened, he locked eyes with the tiny spider for a moment and just like that the spider was gone.The towns paper headline the next day read, "Freak chemical spray liquefies fifty students."In reality, the town never really knew what happened because all they found was one student remaining in the forest, a student named Gary who was left without either of his eyeballs to see with or either of his ear drums to hear with, and without a tongue to speak with.He had been locked away from the world into a place of torment, a place of his own making.There were always rumors that there was one more student that had made it out of the forest.All Jimmy knew was that he never was picked on again, and he never missed a chance to save a spider from that day on.
