\[1\] ***The Sightless - 2 years ago***.When I was a child my mother would instruct me to put on blindfolds when I had uncontrollable tantrums.Growing up in the Caribbean this form of 'punishing therapy' was unheard of.Where other kids would get a stern lashing that multiplied by the crescendo of anger, I was given exercises to manage myself.After The Great Blinding those games I played had taught me to manage.When it began I screamed, I yelled, I hyper ventilated - and then I became fortunate that I didn't share the fate of those who were driving.I heard cars collide into objects, people, animals.Someone killed themselves, I believe.For two whole years I lived like this.You would never want to imagine the despicable things I did to survive.I would lure animals into my home and butcher them.For dogs I cuddled them, covered their muzzles when they found trust in me, and I would take my kitchen knife and gut them.I cried every time.I don't know what other people did.The lucky ones who stocked up on canned goods probably fared better.But that was the beginning.By year two I learned to use a walking stick made from a broom handle.I would venture out into the open, occasionally someone else would be on the streets.The air smelled pungent and sour.Bodies were here and there, and I knew this.I carefully avoided them the best I could but would sometimes run into one and fall.Have you ever fell in garbage before?6-months into the second year of the Great Blinding I noticed I heard sounds that were alien and familiar at once.Helicopters?Yes.That's what they were.Had to be.God I needed a shave back then.I could feel the hairs on my chin itch at the thought of everyone being rescued, and then brought into what?I dismissed the thought as childish wish-fulfillment.But then the streets began to smell cleaner, the air smelled crisper.Something was going on.But that only happened for a month.I'mguessing that people began to adapt to sightless travel?Who knew.Technology like that was probably in development long before; you know how there's always research and development going on?Bah.More childish thoughts.It wasn't until the morning 4 months later, I think it was four.I'm not sure, but four months later I that the light in my eyes opened while on a walk.And then I saw colours.Beautiful, vibrant.It was as if I was born again.The trees were green.The streets, cleaned.Paved roads, houses rebuilt.What in the hell happened?The sun's brightness irritated me for a while until I truly adjusted.I didn't discard my stick, I kept it on my back as a sort of relic to ward me from the evils that could be reality.I wasn't sure this was a permanent phenomenon.I raided a food store.Someone else and another and more have thought the same as I did.There wasn't much fighting.Actually, none except for an argument over who got the last tomato paste.I'd imagine there wasn't much people left on my island.I smiled.Good ol' Bahamians.I took as much ravioli and canned soup as I could manage and carted whatever I could back home.And then, my eyes opened once more - "Don't tell them you can see."\[2\] ***Seeing blind - 2 years later***

"Don't tell them you can see" was sprayed all across the walls in my living room."Don't tell them you can see"?I repeated out loud.I pondered what it meant, tugging at my straggly beard, reminding me I needed a shave.Don't tell who I can see?Who are they?Who is them?It wasn't anyone in the food store, was it?No.Someone came in my home and vandalized it.Were they those men from the helicopters?The following day I walked the same eastern road streets and then I saw "them".Men in tactical uniforms with helmets that shielded their eyes and a hollow eye printed over it, grabbing a small bracket of people.I wasn't noticed.I fell back and observed behind an obstacle."Secure the area and round up all of the 'sighters!'"called out a heavily armed man of a large muscular build."Man you can't do this to me!"The 'sighter' protested.So we were sighters now?It's amazing the things we invent to disregard humanity, then apply onto one another.Fearing that I was next I avoided sight until I bumped into someone.Oh shit.There, behind me, was medium framed female with plump lips with a thin scar across the top and bottom.She has seen violence and has committed it as well.I thought to stand clear.She put up her hand and waved it in front of me.What saved my life was "Don't tell them you can see" which I remembered intimately as it was a great trouble to remove it from my wall.Then she circled around me, stopping in front of my face once she did not see my eyes connect with her movements.Finally she pulled out her hand gun and I faced the business end of the nozzle.After a solid minute I stood still looking around aimlessly.I feigned blindness, turning my head to face the sound.She took a step closer until I said, "Who's there?"That took her by surprise and she withdrew her weapon.Her voice was melodious but rough, "All clear here.You should return home.It's dangerous out here, we have hijackers and robbers.People who wish to do you harm.Where do you live?I'll escort you ba-"

"No need.I can find my way home.I was blind before The Great Blinding."She paused.Something was wrong.She drew her weapon once more, and spoke into her comm, "Possible sighter, engaging with the suspect, over.""W-what?I-I can't see, I swear!"She took me by the arm and subdued me on the ground.I had no hopes of winning this fight.I haven't fought anyone in years.I tried to resist but only because the floor was hard and it was hot.The sweat on my face allowed small pebbles to stick to it.I could feel my skin grating against the concrete while her knee was pressed into my back.She got out a pair of handcuffs, which I knew because of the sound.Where was I going to be taken to?I had no clue."I have the suspect secured.Awaiting detention van."She said into the comm, then turning to me, "We're going to find out everything we can about your organization.You're making this harder for all of us.You PUPILs won't stop until we're all dead."She slammed her gun into my head so hard it bounced against the floor and I passed out.\[3\] **PUPIL**

I was aroused to consciousness when I heard the sounds of violence.Someone was fighting.Was it more of those soldiers?I heard a body drop, then gunshots.It was hot, my skin was broken and bruised, I felt pain everywhere.Then I felt a strong grip grabbing my bicep, pulling me to my feet."You shouldn't have let them know you knew about the Great Blinding."The voice was warm and authoritative.I turned around to face my rescuer.It was a short man with a bushy beard.He had several other people behind him.Two women, a boy, and three other men.I noticed the rescuer had a tattoo of a crying eye on his neck.I assumed everyone else had a similar tattoo."We are PUPIL.I tagged your house.Like us, you are a 'Seer', and not a 'Sighter'.We're all over the globe.The radio you heard was us.They're rounding us up and feeding us to 'it'.But we are resisting that.You must come with us, we'll tell you the rest along the way.In fact, we must hurry."I felt the urgency of his words and was too afraid of being roughed around to protest.So I followed them.It was becoming dusk.I heard strange noises from the sky.As I turned my head around I saw what IT was...A large chirpoteran creature with tentacles standing in place of its face and human arms wrapping around its torso was flying through."YOU FOOL!"Shouted the bearded saviour.He covered his eyes and threw me a knife, "You let it know you can see.We are anomalies!We either become them or stay like us, but once it knows you can see it comes after you.Take this.If you surive, find us at the Dundas centre for the performing arts.Good luck."To prevent me from following he pulled out a gun, aiming it at me until he was far enough.I picked up the knife and examined it.Then I looked back up.The creature was descending.I looked down at the knife, and then I thought to myself *I have little choice but to fight.This is a whole new world I've opened my eyes to, and I plan to survive and see it through.I will join PUPIL.I will live.*
