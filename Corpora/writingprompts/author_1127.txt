I sat at the desk dumb-founded.You mean... you mean this is everything that could have happened if I just made a different decisions?

The spirit in front of me is a friendly face but the marks on her neck tell a story of sadness.She looks at me as if Im the first she says this to.Yes.From the day you were born to the day you died.Every decision and every outcome.Although trust me when I say that anything before the age of 10 is more just whining and boredom.You may have done something crucial back then that caused a different outcome but its highly unlikely.Anyways.The book is yours.Feel free to read and digest it.But just know, you cant change anything.Everything that happened is set.You can only see what could have happened. She gave me a look that may have been a look to scare me but really I just wanted to get out of there.I picked up the book and walked out of the office.As soon as the door behind me closed, I let out an unneeded breath.I looked down at the book in my hands.Every decision.There was one passage I just had to read.One passage I thought was the reason for all the karma and the outcomes I made.The one reason I died.I was in a car accident.A severe car accident where We ran off the side of a cliff and into the ocean.As far as Im aware, there were no survivors of the accident but I didnt see anyone else.It was just me.I looked around.It seemed like I hadnt left Earth.I was still on the green and blue planet.But I knew that wasnt true.When you die, you become a spirit and go to a place that is similar to where you left.So I was in California, on a cliff, overlooking the ocean.I sat at the edge and opened the book to the date I knew it all started.The date I knew I had meet my match to death.I took another  unnecessary breath and opened to July 18th, 2010.The day I meet Parker.The day I opened myself up to pain and abuse and neglect.The day I opened myself to telling myself that it wasnt him.The day I started to leave my family behind.On the page it has Parkers name and the place we meet.The skate park.I couldnt skate but I would go with my best friend, Amanda, and we would check the guys out.I remember the day so clear.I introduced myself Ava. And he told me his name Parker. I remember being taken in by his sharp green eyes and the dyed jet black hair.The way his pants hung loose on his hips.I was a senior in high school and craved attention from any male I could get.We had talked and talked and soon became more than just friends.When I graduated, we left the small town we lived in Colorado and moved to California.It was a mistake.We couldnt find a job or a place to live that we could stay in longer than 6 months.Drugs became an obsession for Parker while I stayed away and just waitress.It was long hours and strained our relationship but one of us had to work.The drugs became more of a problem and when I refused to give him money for them anymore, he hit me and told me to obey.Thats when I thought I wasnt going to be able to leave.I had planned on leaving after I had saved enough money.I knew my sister would let me stay with her, I just had to get to her myself.I had been stashing money and lied to Parker that I didnt have anything for him.He found it.My sister came once to save me but I was too weak under Parkers control.I told her that I was fine.Ava.Your arms are bruised and you have lost weight.Not to mention the look of this place.You need to come home.Were worried. 

Worried?Where were you when I turned 18 and moved out here?You didnt seem to care then.Why care now? And the door slammed in her face.I have never felt more guilt.Then just a few months later, comes the day I die.I finally made the decision that I couldnt do this.We were driving up the coast just to get some fresh air.I looked over at Parker and felt fear not love and thats not what I wanted.Im leaving. I had blurted.Parker looked over at me, stunned What did you just say to me?

I cant do this anymore.I missed my sisters wedding.I missed the birth of my nephew.My mom is sick.I just want to go home.You and I are not compatible.We  ever were.We lived in a fantasy and hoped it would work but we need to face reality.Were broke.You do drugs.I cant work 7 jobs to make ends meet.Its time to let this die.

At that, Parker had agreed but not to let me go.To let us die.He jerked the wheel and went over the cliff.I remember screaming and slamming on the door to get it to open but the pressure of the water was too much and I couldnt get out.Soon water started to enter the car.Parker just laughed and said we deserved to be together for eternity.I think he died laughing.I looked down at the page.Page number 37.The options were (approach Parker, pages 37-150) or (stay with Amanda, pages 150-350).I turned to page 150.Edit: so sorry about the formatting!I did it on my phone but it should be all fixed now.
