You wanna know about my life, huh?Well let's have a nice fireside chat and I'll tell you all about it.If you're looking for a heart warming tale about cuddles, rainbows and endless pats on the scruff of the neck, I encourage you to stop reading now.My story starts in a dark and dingy part of the city.Dad was a retired police dog who I'd never met; everything I knew about him came from stories from mom, and other dogs in the neighbourhood.His stints on the force hadn't gone unrecognised and while I was nothing special, it was refreshing to be related to a dog of such legacy.I was born and raised on the porch of an old Minnesotan.He'd sold off all of my brothers and sisters for a tuppence, save me.I was the runt of the litter, so I was left behind with mom and one hell of an inferiority complex.Whenever I'd go out to play with neighbourhood pups, I'd face a barrage of snide barks about my size.My puphood was marred with constant deprecations, the likes of which have stayed with me to this day."Nothing personal, kid.You're just too small!"I don't remember much of my first few months of life, just that I'd come home each day and cuddle up in the warm embrace of my mother and cry myself to sleep.I remember the face of my one true love, a golden retriever Sally, who lived a few blocks down.Her white-gold face remains etched in my memory to this day, the grace of her snout, the shapeliness of her paws.I'd save a few rashers of bacon from my breakfast each morning and carry them to her.The effort was worth it to see her beautiful face light up with happiness.Every day we'd walk the block together collecting pats and smiles from strangers, bar the occasional whack on the neck from disgruntled pedestrians who would never understand love or care.Sally was my everything, and our happiness stood unmarred.That was, until her humans moved away taking her shimmering face with them.I'm not going to dwell too much on this loss, as it pales in comparison to what was to come.One evening I returned home, exhuasted from the day's doggy shennanigans.My best friend, Presley the beagle had discovered a secret path which led straight to a settlement of ducks.What fun sneaking up on those feathered bastards was!I was still spitting out feathers as I walked through the door of the old Minnesotan's home.Now, the first thing I should've noticed was the already open door and the frenzied cries of my mother coming from the back of the house.I thought nothing of it, and simply chalked it up to the man needing some fresh air, and my mother wanting to be let out.But this was a quantum distance away from the truth and it became clearer as I further pattered along the hallway.Furniture was smashed all over the floor, and a pungent smell of rotting flesh and blood attacked my nose.I ran to the source of the smell.Nothing could prepare me for the sight I was to see.The old Minessotan was face down on the floor, with his hands outstretched by his side and a pool of human blood gathering by his head.I cried out for Lassie knows how long.My mother's shrieks joined my own, and for three days and three nights we mourned.Hungry, cold and sad we slept on the porch.Mom had been left chained to the porch, so food gathering was left to me; I would walk the neighbourhood from end to end looking for scraps to bring home to my starving mother.This went on for a week, a constant cycle of hunger and frustration and wading through the trash in the hopes of maybe finding discarded scraps of beef or even, Lassie forbid, salad!Can you imagine?The desparation a dog like me would need to feel for *salad* to be considered a meal option!My stint as a scavenger came to an end when finally, a curious old woman ventured into our home.Her screams of terror when she found my deceased owner will stay with me to this day.The rest was a blur.The too-loud and too-bright police cars.The cold hands of animal control.Being taken away from my mother.And the cage.Oh, rawhide bones, the cage.For what seemed like an eternity, I lived my life as a captive.Occasionally humans would come by and inspect me, only to walk by with a shake of the head and a leer."This one's ugly!I want a pretty dog!"Cried one child.I peered at her over-plump and hairless face, incredulous.*She* was in no positon to be handing out judgments of that sort, I thought haughtily.I don't remember how long that cage was my home, but I do remember the happiest day of my life.The day I left it.The cold, rough hands of animal control were replaced with the warm and loving hands of my new humans.The snide insults were replaced with "good boy!"and "you're the best dog!"Smacks on the back were replaced with loving belly scratches, and the scraps of meat I had scavenged were replaced with the finest gourmet meals.I've been with my humans for a few years now, and life is good.I could never have wished for better carers, and I hope they know this.I think they do.My humans are sitting around me crying, stroking my hair.If I could speak to them, I'd tell them not to mourn.My life has been fruitful and happy because of them; they've given me everything a dog could want.So that's me, ladies and gents.I can feel my body getting tired now, and I'm starting to prepare myself for the long sleep.
