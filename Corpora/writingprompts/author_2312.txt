I thought death would be so much more dramatic, it isn't though, it just... happens.I saw a car go through me, and that was it.Of course, I saw my body when I turned around, it was a gruesome sight, I painted the road.I was more interested in the pull, I knew I had to be somewhere, and I could feel it.It didn't take too long for me to find the place, a blue house a few blocks away from my crash.It felt wrong just entering, but I did it anyways.Who's going to call the police on a ghost?I kept following the pull, up the stairs to a room with pink colored walls.The little girl the lived there didn't surprise me, what surprised me was what she said."Hello!You're just in time for the tea party!"*this is the first time i've written anything here, how did I do?Any feedback would be appreciated*
