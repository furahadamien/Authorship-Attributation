Nathan looked incredulously at the translation report.It had taken the last 16 years of his life for him and his team to work out a communication system with the outerlings that was abstract enough to share concepts other than basic mathematics.He had assumed that his translations were once again mistaken, but they had repeated their message in so many different ways that his team couldn't be mistaken on all of them.A galactic limit on the number of sentient creatures.Moreover a galactic limit that was so small that the number of humans on earth was disrupting it.A galaxy with 300 billion star systems somehow could only have 50 billion sentient entities, and of those 16% now resided within orbit of a single planet's satellite.The outerlings hadn't come to negotiate.They had merely come to explain, apologize, and describe how they would effect the population control measures they would implement.A device would be placed in orbit of mercury which would project a field which would doppler shift solar radiation directed towards earth further into the infrared end of the spectrum greatly reducing the ability of plants to gather energy.This would greatly reduce the maximum population the Earth could support.They estimated that human society would take centuries to neutralize the effects of the device which could protect itself by modulating its effect to shower any approaching craft with focused solar radiation.They thought that humanity would behave as natural for any threatened organism.Draw away from the pain, preserve resources, weather the storm.Make sacrifices.Maybe we would.Nathan's team had managed the translations, but they weren't responsible for the decisions, and with the outerlings cutting off contact his team was being dissolved.Each specialist heading back to their own fields of study.They weren't going away empty handed however.During the work to establish communication the outerlings had begun with repetitions of certain universal constants, and formula for converting between them.Many of them had matched with the values we had already worked out on our own.Some had been very close, differing by inconsequential values of accuracy.Others... well they weren't anything we had ever considered, but they had made quite a splash among the theoretically minded.Some interesting things might be happening in the applied sciences in the coming decades.His particular skills wouldn't be needed for that battle, but he figured he could do his part for his species in other ways."Hey, would you like to help save humanity?", might be a bit much for a pickup line, but he though he knew someone who appreciate it.After all increasing the population sevenfold might be taxing, but it was a damn sight better than having it go the other way.
