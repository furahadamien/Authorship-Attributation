"Bastard," Peter Welsh hissed through his teeth.His breath came raggedly as he forced himself down the cobble stone streets of 19 century London.In six minuets his closest friend would kill five men and then be shot dead in a pub, for the third time.Peter forced himself to go faster, he'd been to late last time.He felt the pistol, nestled in his coat, bouncing against his thigh, he'd be prepared this time.He turned a corner and saw it.The Rusty Bee, a pub as disreputable as they came.Peter practically knocked the door of it's hinges as he entered.Before him were six men.One was seated in a booth, tense and ready to pounce.The other five were closing on him at an alarming rate."Third times the charm," Peter growled.He drew his pistol and put a bullet through the thug closest to the booth.Cued by the gun shot the seated man exploded upward and hurled the table at his assailants.In a flash his own pistol was in his hand and firing wildly.Three men went down.Peter had the presence of mind to turn around and fan his piece into the door he just entered through.A reassuring thud told him that the enemy reinforcements wouldn't be bothering him.Back to the task at hand.Peter took in the lay out of the pub.Half the patrons had fled the other half were caught in the crossfire of a furious gun fight.The monster who had hurled the table was now using it as cover and Peter took the opportunity to duck in next to him."How you doing Jack?"Jack Morgan flashed him a smile."Not dead yet Pete!"Peter put his gun around the end of the table and fired blind.A wail told him that he'd hit his target."Three", he mumbled."What's that?"Jack said.Peter made to reply but was interrupted by the crack of rifles.Their improvised cover melted under the assault.Peter felt lead tear through his body and slumped.He looked over to his fried, there was a hole clear through his skull."Shit" Peter said, "fourth time's the charm."He reached into his pocket and pulled out a silver ring.Shaky bloody hands pulled it over his finger.The edges of his vision turned white as he was sucked back wards through time."Don't worry," Peter whispered to the corpse, "I'll get him next time."...

"Bastard," Peter Welsh hissed through his teeth.His breath came raggedly as my forced himself down the cobble stone streets of 19 century London.In six minuets his closest friend would kill five men and then be shot dead in a pub, for the fourth time.God, he hoped it was the last time tonight.
