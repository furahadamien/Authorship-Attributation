Jake was getting back home late again from an exhausting day at the office.He did not like going through the alleyways as it brought back memories of his past, days he was not so proud of and could live leaving them behind.Still he was very tired and decided to cut through the alleys instead of making a cyrcle by going thtough the main roads.Jake was never afraid of the alleys, he was literally raised in them.His family was poor and was leaving in a small dirtx appartement even roaches stayed clear of it.His parents liked to remind him a lot that he was a mistake, the reason for all their poverty and suffering and beat him up constantly for that mistake.Jake was never afraid of the alleys, he had seen it all in there.Crackheads, thieves, drunks, homeless people, rats the size of a dog bullying the alley cats around.Junkies attacking passengers for pocket money and once he even witnessed a rape back when he was 10.He had seen it all.Or so he thought."Give me your wallet!NOW!"The voice cracked through the silence of the dark alley.Jake slowly turned to face the man.He was a tall guy, wearing a black long coat, surprisingly hot for the heat of July, and a fedora hat.Jake was stunned for a second not sure what he was witnessing."IF YOU LOVE YOUR LIFE, GIVE ME YOUR WALLET!NOW!"Jake considered his options.It would not be his first alley brawl, even against an armed man.But the man was looking strange enough and he did not carry much cash anyway.With a sigh, Jake gave the man his wallet.The man proceeds taking the wallet, never brraking eye contact from Jake, throwing it to the ground and shooting it.Hearing a screech, he turns to Jake and says "You are safe now, you ate welcome."Tge man procceeds to disappear as fast and unexpectedly as he appeared.Jake completely forgot he still had that small "screaming" alarm device a colleague of his gave him as a present.It was stupid enough and considered throwing it away, but totally forgot about it due to its small size."Who even thought of making such a small, stupid alarm that screams", Jake had thought to himself with an afterthought ".. And who the hell considers it a nice gift for someone's birthday".Still Jake could not understand what tge man meant by shooting his wallet and saying "You are welcome".Jake entered his home, having enough of the day.His roomate, Max, was sitting in the couch, watching TV really loud for that late hour."Hey J-Dawg, what is up my man?"screamed Max."I told you to keep down with that thing, it is midnight for Christ's sake".Max acted as he never listened to Jake."Man come check it out, they finally caught that nutjob that was loose here for a week.""What nutjob??"Asked Jake perplexed."You know the guy that went around town shooting wallets screaming nonsense.He asked passengers for their wallets, and then he shot at them!The wallets, not the passengers."Max answered bacj almost laughing."Dude even stormed into a store and shot through their wallet collection".Jake looked at the screen, as the police arrested the lunatic that he met earlier, screaming nonsense about "mimics", whatever the hell that meant.The anchorman then said: "Christopher B. Codsworth was a patient in St. Mairy's Hospital suffering from extreme paranoia.He was never dangerous to others but hospital staff was concerned about his dissapearance, almost a week ago."Jake was stunned.He had enough fot one night.He tutned to face Max."You will never believe what happe-.." Jake froze as he turned, unable to concieve what he was seeing.Max was tin on half, by two series of teeth, coming out of the couch...?"AT LAST, CODSWORTH IS OUT OF THE PICTURE" the couch said."THANK GOD I LEARNED TO TURN INTO COUCHES, HE FIGURED MY WALLET DISQUISE".The legs of the couch began to take the form of legs and arms with sharp claws, and as the rest of the coich was transforming to a strange creature, unlike Jake ever seen before, it screamed at him: "SORRY, NO WITNESSES."And with a fast strike, Jake's head fell on the floor..
