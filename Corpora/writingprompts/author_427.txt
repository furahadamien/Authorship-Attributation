I sit at the bar, eyes glued to the television screen as the count down clock reached one hour."Could you save my spot?"I ask the bar tender in my unmistakably american accent that elicited a shocked reaction from some of the other patrons."Sure thing" the bartender responded.The bar wasn't dead but it was understandably quite empty at 11:00 AM.Knowing my spot wouldn't be disturbed, I got up to go use the toilets.My mind was racing, would I finally be able to go home after 50 years?Would home even be the same, what is it like now?I remember my last night in The States, I was my 21st birthday and I knew I would be shipped off to join the Air Force the next day.Drinking the night away, making drunken goodbyes to old friends, I never imagined all of them would be final.The war had been raging for a little under a year at that point but things were already escalating and there was even talk of bringing back the draft so I preemptively joined the Air Force so I could at least choose which branch of service.I became a pilot and was assigned to fly the A-10 warthog which was brought back into service due to the need for more aircraft after being fazed out 5 years prior.I flew hundreds of missions providing air support for ground troops, before being shot down over Tyrol Austria.I was MIA for 3 months, 2 weeks of which I spent lost, injured and starving.To this day I don't know how I survived but eventually I was found, unconscious and naked on the side of the road, by an Austrian farmer.He took me in and nursed me back to health.The real kicker is that the peace treaty was in the process of being signed, 4 days after I was shot down, the final shot of World War III was fired.The plan for American exile was played close to the chest, it had to seem like everyone was doing it so that the Americans wouldn't get suspicious, only the non American heads of state of the Big 6, the major alliance that won the war which included America, UK, Australia, Canada, France and Germany, knew of the actual plan.Everyone was given 2 months to return to the nation of their citizenship or emigrate to the country of their choice before the isolation pact was to go into effect.I did not make it home, I was one of the 1,380 Americans who were "left behind".We were offered a 5 year visa with the promise of citizenship to any country we wanted, I chose the UK.An unintended consequence of the secrecy of the isolation pact was that many companies decided to move to America because they were the world's largest economy.Almost overnight, major companies like BMW, YKK, and Airbus moved to America, while companies like McDonald pulled out of foreign markets to be in compliance with the treaty.This caused a massive 10 year depression and made the already massive task of rebuilding almost impossible.Eventually companies rose to fill the gap that had been made and began to rebuild, but at that point much of the world was unrecognizable.Many parts of the world looked like something out of the old Fallout games, governments collapsed, the EU dissolved, Russia was split into 15 smaller states and the scorched earth policy in China made it uninhabitable and hundreds of millions of Chinese refugees fled to Europe.It took 30 years to rebuild.Now, most of the world looks the same as it did pre-war, except modern culture was heavily influenced by the influx of Chinese refugees who integrated well into society but kept a lot of their customs, traditions and food."You going to go back to America after the isolation pact is lifted?"the bartender asked, bringing me back to reality."I don't know, I've lived here most of my life, and besides, what is a 79 year old retired man going to do?Move into a house I'll only live in for a few more years?And I already have a family here, I'm rooted here now, but on the other hand I yearn to return to my home country".My eyes turn to the television screen as the countdown reads: 0:00:03... 0:00:02... 0:00:01...This is my first time responding to a writing prompt and just decided to try my hand at writing.Sorry if it is bad.
