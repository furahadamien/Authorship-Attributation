MOSCOW
July 2, 1971

"...and the Kremlin has stated it will share the results of it's safety inquiry with NASA in the spirit of international cooperation.The brave crew of Salyut 1 will be remembered as a sober reminder of outer space's unforgiving nature.May their souls rest in peace.This is Dan Rather, reporting from Moscow."The party leader gestured and the secretary shut off the imported American television.It was a frustrating state, relying on a capitalist-built device deep within the halls of Soviet power, but he knew it was just a matter of time before the situation reversed.The dialectic demanded it, after all."There", he told the waiting group, "there have been no reports from the field of anything but acceptance of the story.The Americans have accepted the narrative provided, it's time to move to the next stage."The other party members in the room avoided looking to one another, all nodded in affirmation.The greatest endeavor was to begin in secrecy, but the triumph would soon be on every radio speaker and television screen around the world, no matter which country produced it.The moon landings had been a great achievement, but soon everyone would see the power of true collective power.The leader smiled."Begin the launches."---

SOMEWHERE OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN 
September 28 1971

Georgy Dobrovolsky sat aboard the auxillary guidance device.With luck, he'd not need it, but the 'unforgiving nature' of space was real, even if the American reporter had been mistaken about the fatalities about which he'd reported.Checking his scope, Georgy checked the approaching propulsion module."25 meters", he called out."Nominal approach continues."Viktor floated next to him, strapped into the seat on the wall of the former space station.He nodded, watching the monitor in front of him."Da, ground control has reported the same.Continue to checklist item...  25a.Terminal radio beacon activate."The two looked up at the panel next to the guidance frame Georgy sat on.It looked more like a bicycle than anything else, but no cyclist had ever travelled this fast.A light on the panel illuminated."Terminal guidance beacon has activated", he pronounced.After a few minutes, there was a slight jarring sound as the oversized propulsion module slid into place."Contact, positive latching...  confirmed.Docking sequence complete."The two unstrapped from their stations and took turns looking backwards through the periscope.Behind them, a series of large tanks stretched backwards from the aft docking port.Vladislav Volkov floated over from the kitchen."Do ve have a spaceship?"he asked.The three looked at each other, faces beaming.Dobrovolsky was the first to speak."Comrades, it is with great pleasure that I announce the retirement of Salyut 1 and welcome you both...   to the Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.May Mars's red light fill our windows and help spread the light of Soviet greatness.""To Mars!"the other two cheered.---

WASHINGTON, DC
October 1, 1971

"Mister President, what are your orders?"President Nixon stared at the diagram on the briefing room wall quietly.The damn reds had skunked him, and good."Sir", the National Security Advisor murmured in his deep germanic accent, "if we interfere, it could be seen as an act of war."The other military representative at the other side shook his head fiercely."Goddamnit, they're tearing us apart in Asia, now you want to sit back and let them take a WHOLE PLANET?"He slammed his fist on the table."Sir, if we launch now, we can make it look like an accident.Hell, as far as the rest of the world knows, those cosmonauts died months ago.The red's'll have no way to accuse us of anything without letting the world know they lied.We've got a Titan II on the pad and ready to go, we can put a cloud of ball bearings on an intercept course before you can say 'borscht's done'.Just give me the word!"The president sat, thinking.This was a turning point, he could feel it.If he acted, he might save the US from losing face, but at what cost?Then again, things with China were starting to cool a little.Could he jeopardize any of that?No, the country needed a firm hand to guide it now more than ever, and he knew that provoking the bear would be a distraction."Don't do anything, stand down General.Maybe the horse will learn to sing, but no provocation.Do you understand me?"He glowered at the man, his jowls shaking slightly."Yes, sir."The general sat back.There'd be more opportunities to fix this, but he could tell now wasn't the time or place.---

INDIAN OCEAN
October 2, 1971

The tracking ship rocked slightly out at sea.Chelomei watched the sky, smoking his cigarette.The radar dishes and antennas moved as one, tracking the tiny dot he saw coming over the horizon.It was time.Throwing the half-smoked thing over the rail, he peered at the dot intently.Behind him, he knew the radio and radar operators were watching their screens closely but he wanted to see it with his own eyes and-  there, it had begun.The tiny dot brightened slightly.He knew that the experimental Block D in back was now gulping fuel through the intricate plumbing of the fuel tanks installed over the previous months.Kosmos 419, Mars 2, Mars 3, Luna 18....  secretly launching the heavy tanks to the station had been almost impossible with all the eyes around the world, but the Soviet discretion had somehow pulled it off.Mars probes that existed only on paper, a robotic moon lander, a lunar observation satellite....  five Proton launches in a row to assemble the great voyage above everyone's head.His rocket had met the task and exceeded all expecations.He knew many scientists would be disappointed when their payload return mission failed or their Martian probe returned faked data, but he knew they would forgive all when they learned the truth.The landers, of course, must be said to have failed.A shame, but soon men would arrive.The truth was, there was only one way to send the brave cosmonauts to Mars, and that was to assemble their long-duration ship on orbit.As he mused, the dot passed overhead, the Block D burning through the kerosene and liquid oxygen steadily.He liked to imagine he could see it already going faster, but he knew that was probably his imagination.Hearing a cheer inside, he stood and finally looked away from the dot as it disappeared over the horizon.He did not need to ask, he knew from the sound that the burn had been good.In six months, the world would know of their hard work and the next stage of work could begin in earnest.--- 

VANDENBERG AFB
February 16, 1972

The General walked out of the control room.The Northern California hills were quiet, they always were after a launch.The Titan III that had just roared upwards had seen to that, the animals were hiding.He knew that if word got out of what his team had done, it would mean the end of his career at best but damnit, he couldn't just let the reds get to Mars.Those boys in Asia had gone through too much under commie guns and planes to just let something like this pass.His staff would report that the satellite had failed to reach it's intended orbit.The high energy upper stage requisitioned for the high-altitude Molniya orbit was more than enough to send the Special Package on its way, seeing as how much lighter it was.A stern chase was a long chase, but the boys in trajectory were confident it'd go where it was needed.Whistling to himself, the general walked out to the staff car waiting.If any of the guards thought it was strange that he looked so happy after a launch failure far above, they kept it to themselves.(Continued)
