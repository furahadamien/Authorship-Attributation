I'll admit that I sometimes take pranks too far.But how was I supposed to know?I started as soon as he hatched from his little egg.Read him bedtime passages from The Philosopher's Stone first, of course, then onto the next book, and the next.Watched the movies over and over with him on my lap.Even called him Harry, just in case.Next were the clothes.Jumpers, scarves, even cute little tail warmers.The missus thought that was cute, even made a bigger one for my tail as well.Ravenclaw though, I thought Griffindor or Slytherin would be too obvious.He loved it all of course, thought that Rowling was the best biographer around.And the production value of those 'documentaries'!I made him swear he wouldn't talk about it to his classmates at school, didn't want them giving away the game you see.And then that fateful day came.I stood behind him at the station platform, smile ready to burst forth when him and his little trolley collided into the brickwork.So, imagine my surprise when, just like in the movies, he just up and slips on through!I remember going up and touching the pillar, first gently, and then slapping it with my hand, my tail flicking back and forth in agitation.I knew instantly what had happened of course, I knew the stories as well as him, after all.All I can remember next is tears filling my eyes as I shouted into that innocent looking brick pillar, as I realised what I had done."No, it wasn't meant to be like this!It was meant to be a joke, a prank!"I looked around as passers-by regarded me, not understanding.I raised my voice and shouted into the pillar, desperate for him to hear me on the other side somehow."No son no, this can't be real, you can't have magic, you can't!""YOU'RE A LIZARD, HARRY!!"
