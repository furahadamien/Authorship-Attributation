HIP13044b
Abstract:

Third rocky planet in system LB44-5 remnants of earliest discovered intelligent civilisation predating other specimens by nearly 1 billion years.While the host planet has suffered considerable surface damage due to the deteriorating stability of the star the sub surface layers of rocks entrap areas of high nitrogen and oxygen content as well as minerals consistent with a shallow aquatic surface no more than 4km deep.Tech-tonic formation has obliterated much of this layer however abundant layered rock the oldest plateaus on continental shelves show a distinct layer of artificially constructed polymers, oxides metal with high concentrations and crystalline silica residues ranging from the microscopic to the ranges of a few hundred meters in length.The abundance of such material are not present below this layer found from surface to 300m below the surface.While trace fossils have been discovered it is difficult to determine the exact makeup of this species but trace fossil examination of skull fragments gives the approximate taxonomy which suggests a derived mammal/synapsid.A full survey of the satellite moon has not been attempted due to stability concerns of its surface a full expedition might reveal exquisitely preserved materials concerning this species foray into interplanetary travel.
