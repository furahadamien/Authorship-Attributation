The red of the line was like a forecast of doom, and I had been sure to always trust the green.Wealth, contentment, and opportunity had followed in the wake of my devotion to its ceaseless lead.But ultimately the green line offered boredom and an unquenchable thirst and curiosity.I stepped away from it, determined to never follow it as long as I drew breath.The red line diverged ahead, winding off into some undefinable unknown.The first step was liberating, but perhaps that was not due to the nature of the line itself, but my own conditions.The next step had me meet with a large truck, seemingly out of nowhere.It struck me full on my front, launching me ten billion feet into the air where a herd of snow geese pummeled and tore at me.I began to fall, my flesh hanging from my bones in tatters.A plane flew toward me and I was devoured by one of its engines.Instantly, I was vaporized in a searing ball of flame.Fuck the red line.
