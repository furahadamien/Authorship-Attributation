This?This was truly ridiculous.Nerves were making her fingers tingle and Neira rubbed her fingertips together to keep from feeling the clamminess of her palms.A wave of heat crept up her neck and the prickling was a crackle in her ears.She could almost hear the flush on her skin and the vibration of her heartbeat grew louder.Her mouth was going dry and Neira forced a swallow and a deep breath."You can't do shit like this, Paul.It wasn't cute ten years ago and it sure as *fuck* isn't cute now."Her voice was a brittle snap in the quiet of her condo living room and the pop between her shoulder blades eased the tension that was locking up her spine.Life as a single twenty-something was fairly bland, all things considered.While numerous horror stories flipped through her head before purchasing her first home, she never considered something like this.Paul Merriman had broken into her home and was currently sitting in her favorite chair as if he lived with her.He'd aged the way one does from high school into adulthood: The last vestiges of growing pains had melted away and his face was a little more sharp, more in focus than the awkward bits of roundness he had as a teenager.His brow was more prominent; furrowed in confusion that reminded her of the last time she'd snapped at him the day they broke up.Even after all this time, he still didn't get that these gestures were anything but romantic or welcome or even friendly."Neira, you're not getting--"

She surged forward and got into his space, looming over him with teeth gnashing."*You broke into my house!*" She feels the heated sting in the corner of her eyes and the shaking of her hands begins to start."You broke into my house and you scared me!How do you not *fucking get it?*" Her hair was sticking to the back of her neck.She'd worked so hard on it today with the rare surge of motivation to curl her hair and put on a little makeup and now the pink and blue curls of her hair were starting to stick to the back of her neck.There was no knowing what Paul would do.There was no knowing if he'd kill her or attack her so regardless of the outcome, she would not take this quietly."Neira, I just came to check on you.I'm sorry--"

"No.No, you don't get to fucking talk."She backed away out of his reach while Paul's thin lips gaped in confusion and his jaw clenched in frustration.He'd never hit her and he wasn't so much bigger than her, but there was the air of insecurity between them when they dated.Young and stupid and unknowing, there were gestures that at first seemed sweet and romantic until Neira began listening to her gut.Detailing her car for her when she was stressed out about finals wasn't the problem.The problem had been that he had made a copy of her keys in order to do it.Tapping on her second story bedroom to come in wasn't a problem.The problem was that he'd taken the screen off, opened it, and she woke up in a cold, gasping sweat to see her boyfriend in her room there and 'ready to comfort her' because she told him she'd had nightmares recently.Small gestures and actions began to add up as he inserted himself into her life to the point where Neira couldn't be sure if he was trying to puppet her, confuse her, or what.Paul gets up out of the chair and Neira takes another breath and keeps her eyes trained on him.He's taller than her by a good five inches, but she's heavier than he is, and she can use that to her advantage."I wanted to offer you a place to stay, you know?'Cause I'm really sorry a-and... fuck...I fucked up.But, dude, come on!I can set you up somewhere really nice, okay?I'm just trying to say sorry--"

His words are cut off by the crash of the front door and Neira backpedals away from him, arms in the air as SWAT bursts in to swarm the room.Paul's eyes grow wide and she realizes that he truly didn't think anything would come from this.He'd never hurt her, but he scared her.He'd always scared her and not once did he ever listen.> This is the first prompt I've ever done here and I did this all on the fly.Thank you!
