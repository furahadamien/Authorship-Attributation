The curtains shrugged, their red cotton billowing as they parted.Behind them, a huge screen began to flicker with grey and white dots: the static of anticipation.Tracey looked around her; she wasn't scared -- she knew where she was.Or at least *roughly*, she knew where she was.Mainly boys and girls sat on the tall, crimson seats around her -- a few older looking children too, but no adults.Just... freaks whose faces were a twisted abnormality of her own; who wore self-satisfied smiles as the tossed popcorn at each other and giggled stupidly.It was like flicking through a family photo album that had been half melted in a fire.She already hated them and their happiness."Hey," said a boy next to her."You're new here, right?"Tracey was about to tell him to *mind-his-own-damned-business*, when she noticed his smile.The boy's front tooth, on the left side, was chipped almost identically to her own."My name's Andrew," he said."Are you a Tracey or an Emily, or..."

He left a gap for Tracey to fill in.She didn't

The boy pushed his popcorn towards her; popped kernels spilled over the edge like a frothing wave."Do you want some?We can share -- it's not problem, I can always get more.""Your tooth," she said, pointing to her own."How did you?"He giggled."Same way the rest of us d-"

"Shh," said someone behind them."*It's starting.*"

A moving picture appeared on the screen; black and white, like one of those movies she'd never watched fully when they came on television.The image was of a small town Tracey recognised.There were swollen, black clouds lurking menacingly over it, throwing their heavy burden down onto the town as if out of spite.As Tracey watched, the image panned in on the sprawling grey brick of the town's only hospital -- then went closer still, closer to the ground, until it arrived outside the hospital's wide front door.A voice began to speak as the camera rushed down sterile hallways; a voice deep and rich, with a resonance that sent a shiver down Tracey's spine."Emily Oates was born in the town of Thicket Springs, on January the first, 2004.As the small, former mining town battled against the worst storm it had witnessed in over fifty years, Julia Oates battled inside Saint Mary's hospital for something else entirely: her life, and that of her baby.""You might want to look away," whispered Andrew."Most don't like this part, but personally...I like seeing what she looked like.It's better than the photos."He smiled goofily as he looked back at the screen.Tracey glanced around the cinema; many of the children were covering their eyes or holding their popcorn bags in front of their faces.The camera focused on her mother's straining face, as blood vessels inside her burst.On the tears that fell from her beaming face as -- for just a moment -- she heard her baby girl cry."This was a battle Julia believed she won," said the deep voice, sounding at least slightly mournful."Even as her eyes closed, for a final time."Tracey swallowed hard, determined not to let tears well in her eyes.She never cried.No.It wouldn't happen!The film moved on: the funeral and the mourners dressed in black, smiling as they hovered over the pram.Her dad always there for her; feeding and changing and singing to her.Then, it showed a side of him she couldn't have known about back then; the manifested depression that he'd suffered on losing his wife.How when she slept in her crib, he never did.When his lullabies sent her to a peaceful sleep, he would take a bottle of whiskey to his room and drink until the sun rose or she cried out."I didn't know..." she whispered, not meaning to say it out loud."Of course not," said Andrew."How could we have done?""We?""You must have guessed who we all are, right?""I...You're... you're other me-s?""Yeah.Like I'm the brother you never had.And you're my sister."Again, Tracey wrestled back a smile.How she'd always longed for a sibling.The narrator continued and the film moved on.There was a roar of laughter whenever the baby on the screen giggled; more laughs as she grew older, and a little wiser -- when her dad asked her to eat her apple, and she responded with: *uh-uh, look what it did to snow white.* Even Tracey couldn't stifle a chuckle.There was a roar when the accident on the see-saw came -- and a lot of hands raised to soothe a phantom pain that had made itself known on their chipped front teeth.But the laughter soon died as she grew older, and as the screen showed her father, sitting in his office with a pile of bills on the table next to him.The audience in the cinema became hushed.Her father picked up a coin and flicked it.It landed on heads.He cried into his hands and fumbled for a bottle of whiskey in the cupboard below."What's going on?"asked Tracey."It's the day he decided... you know.""Oh..."

"Yeah.That he couldn't go on like this."Tracey didn't stop the tears this time.The girl -- that sweet baby on the screen -- was going to go down the same road as her.The loss of her father.Living with her uncle and... all that came with him.The school, the bullies -- no one believing.She ran a hand gently over her wrists.Andrew must have seen her tears because he leaned over and squeezed her hand."It's okay," he said gently."How!"she screamed."How is it okay?"She flung his hand away and tried to get up -- but she couldn't.She couldn't move."Because we get a new friend.Because she gets a new friend, too.People that love her.""That doesn't make it okay!"she yelled as hot tears and snot streaked her face."Maybe not, but it's what happens.And one day, this"--he waved his arms around the cinema--"this all changes.We all move on.Until then, enjoy the moments of happiness, and try to forget the bad.""I don't want to watch any more!I can't!""You're not alone, Tracey.Not any more.It is Tracey, right?We've all been through it.*All of us*.The first time is always so difficult.And honestly, it's never easy.But know this -- you're loved.You always were, you know.He does it because he didn't want you seeing him like that.Because he wanted you to have a better life.""...that's not what happened.""It's what he hoped would happen.Your mother would have given her own life a hundred times over for you, too.""I-"

Andrew took her hand again."So would I.So would any of us.""Will- will this keep happening?Will there be infinite Emilys?""No.Eventually something different will happen.Maybe our mom will live, or something, and everything will be different.And when things change, when a Tracey or an Emily -- or whoever -- has a proper shot at life, we all move on.Until then, Tracey, we've at least got each other."As Tracey looked at Andrew, there was sudden a gasp that filled the huge room -- as if every child had taken in a huge lungful of air all at once.Even Andrew looked in shock.Tracey looked up at the screen."What made him look in Emily's room before going to the attic as intended," said the narrator, "we may never know."She watched, as her father crept in and kissed Emily on the forehead."But whatever his reason, he decided he would change things."There was an eruption of applause and cheering as the first bottle of whiskey was emptied into the sink."And change things he would."

"Raul," crooned Raul in a very suspicious French accent, as he took the lady's hand and graced his eager lips on it."Let me guess," he continued, releasing his grip and pulling a chair out from the table."Sit, please.Let me guess, you're a Mari- no, no, you're a Cassandra?I'm right, am I not?"*Suave.* Yes, that was what he would be today.The woman's botoxed forehead tried its best to frown, her lips fighting (and losing) a similarly uneven battle."How on Earth did you know that?"Raul slicked his dark hair back with ringed fingers."Your beauty, it was that of a Maria, or a Cassandra, and there was a certain radiance that could be of no Maria.I see, no wrinkle has dared to blight your perfect face -- that tells me all I need to know."He lowered his voice to a rippling whisper."*All I need to know.*"

Cassandra giggled through perfectly still lips as she slid into a seat."My," she said, "You are a charmer.And that accent...Australian?""Australian?""Yes.I'm certain of it.I've got an aunt who lives there, and strike me down if you don't sound *just the same!* Don't worry -- she's a smoker."Raul cursed himself silently.He hadn't done enough research for the role.No, it was fine -- he'd improvise."Yes, mate.Good catch."He sat in his seat and raised a hand, clicking his fingers to gain the attention of a waiter."If I had a bloody boomerang, I'd get us the wine myself," he said with a wink.Another half chuckle as the waiter approached.Raul knew her very favourite drink, her very favourite food...Yes, this time he'd get the pudding he'd been after for so long.But he had to be confident.She liked confident."Lambrusco, for the lovely Sheila.And the house re- a uh..."--he swallowed hard--"Fosters for me."The waiter lifted his head and eyed Raul snobbishily."*House Fosters*, sir?""Yeah," Raul replied, tugging at his shirt."You know, out of the house tap.""Very good, sir.And to eat?""Pie and chips for the lady, and... do you do anything off the barbie?""Sir?""Struth.Just a burger then, mate."The lady eyed Raul with suspicion."I wouldn't normally let someone order for me, but... How did you know I loved pies?""Know?Oh, that you're a classy pie lass?Well, it's obvious ain't it.""Is it?""It is to me.A lady who would wear a fashionable tracksuit like that, to a place like this, well, she'd be after the fanciest meal on the whole bloody menu."If she could have smiled she would have done, Raul hoped.God, she was beautiful.Beneath all that make up.Maybe.Raul began to sweat.This was the best any of their dates had gone *to date*.He couldn't mess it up now.It was time to lay his heart on the table."Look, Cassandra, I'm gonna' level with you.I think you're mighty fine, and I reckon you think I'm fine.I mean, I figure I'm the sort of guy you'd normally go for."Cassandara shrugged."Eh.""Eh?What do you mean, 'eh'"?"You're a little too pretty-boy, for my tastes, to be honest.""You can't be serious.You can't be bloody serious!I've seen all the men you've rejected.What the hell is left?"Cassandra went tense."You've *seen* the men I've been out with?""Well I er, oh struth," Raul said sadly, knowing he couldn't stop it now.The man's stylish exterior began to wilt, his skin flaking to reveal the green monstrosity beneath.Screams echoed about the restaurant and cutlery migrated high in all directions."Wh-what kind of monster are you?"asked Cassandra, her lips trying desperately to quiver."Me?"Raul asked, a rage in the pit of his stomach rising."Me?!What the hell kind of monster are *you*?-- That's the real question!I've tried *everything* to please you.I've been Brad bloody Pitt and Oscar bloomin Wilde.Nothing makes you happy.Nothing!"He realised at this point that he didn't *need* to keep the accent up, but there was something rather bloody pleasing about it."Th-hey were *you*?"Raul's skin began to change again, his black hair falling out in thick clumps, while greasy blonde hair sprouted hurriedly in its place.It took only seconds for Cassandra to be face to face with... Cassandra."This," said the new Cassandra, as it got up from its seat, "Is the only person I think you could ever love.You are the worst specimen of any creature I've ever met.And I've been to the Betelgeuse system *and* Scotland.Good day to you!"Raul/Cassandra had almost stomped its way to the door, when it heard the plaintive scream from behind and stopped in its tracks."Waiiit!"The other Cassandra came running up to it."What do you want now?Come to mock me one last time?""Mock?No!I'd never mock someone like you.Mmm mm mmmm, you are *gorgeous*.I think...I think I was a bit hasty.How about one more try?"she asked with a salacious wink.Raul/Cassandra  smiled.*Finally*."Can you change *any* part of your body?"she inquired as they walked back towards their table.

"Hey, watch it!"I turn to see her.The brakes on the lorry scream and hiss.She reaches me, tries to push me -- but the lorry-

Darkness.Light.A staccato drum beat of blinding white, and in it, I see her again.Just, passing her in the street, but she turns to look at me and I catch a glimpse of her long hair pulled back into a pony tail."Run," she whispers.The drum beats again.The library."Run?"I repeat stupidly.She puts a finger to her soft, red lips."*Shh - listen.*" 

And again it beats.It's as if I'm watching a flipbook of Polaroid snapshots.And she's in each and every one.I'm at a bar, nursing a full pint of lager.A tap on my shoulder."When."A motel room, paint curling off the mouldy wall.She's lying naked on the bed."You."The drum beats.I'm on the street dressed in rags, holding a can in my hands.She walks by and flicks a coin into the can, jingling as it settles."Awake."A blurry city street is rushing up toward my face.I'm falling.I've jumped off a building and I'm falling!I hear a shout from above."Run!"---

I gasp, straining for breath as I stumble out of... *something*.I lurch forward, fall onto my knees and wretch.There's no more drumbeat.No more blinding light.Just the vile stench of piss and vomit.The cold of concrete beneath my bare legs.Reality.I look at the machine I fell out of.It's like a sarcophagus, only full of wires and neon lights.I feel them tug on my back.I reach behind me and snap the wires away from my skin, wincing in pain each time.*Run*, I hear the voice in my head whisper.I remember...I'm about to start, when I see the face through the steamed window of the sarcophagus next to mine.I try to pull it open, prying my long nails into the slight gap, but they're brittle and snap easily.I look around the huge, metal room.It's like a warehouse, not lined with cardboard boxes, but with sarcophagi.There are metal lockers on the other side of the warehouse.I sprint over to them and fling them open, one after another, until I find a screwdriver.I smash the metal against the viewing glass.It cracks.I push the glass inward with my hand, and it falls through gently.Her eyes open, as a mist of smoke creeps out of the window; I hear a sharp intake of breath.Then she too vomits.There are voices.People are coming!"Push it!"I command her, but she's dazed."Push!"This time she listens.I pry the metal screwdriver back into the gap and push it as if its a crowbar.Together,  we manage to inch it open.I get my fingers in the gap, and as my muscles strain and fingers turn blue, I open it enough for her to slide out of."You- you shouldn't have woken me," she says, grabbing my hand and pulling me away from the voices."Where are we?"I ask as we run."In an experiment.""An experimen-"

She leads me around a corner, where three men wait with guns in their hands."Shit!I'm sorry" she says as she looks at me with pity."I tried to warn you.If you'd just ran without me... Now, you'll have to wake up.""I dont-"  I hear the gunshot,  but I barely register the bullet.---

"Welcome back, sleeper," she says.She's wearing a white lab coat and glasses, hovering over me as she scribbles notes in a black journal.I'm in some kind of laboratory.She looks older now.Her hair grey and face lined.The room is bright and my head pounds.I'm lying prone on a table, restraints on my neck and joints.I struggle,  writhing pointlessly."Who are you?"I ask, once I realise my situation is hopeless."Doctor Magill," she says with a patient smile."And me?""You don't have a name.I call you patient zero.""Patient?""Yes.But we're all patients really.You're just the first we've cured.I hope one day, when I'm long gone, my offspring will be dreaming by your side.""*Cured...*"

She sighs."You must understand, all people are sick.It's the human condition.We don't live long lives like you have done.We live just a day, born with the knowledge of our ancestors, and then, we age and die.A single day.But all that changes with you....  You are proof that we can all live forever, almost, in dreams.A place where time becomes relative.So we paused your body and just let you dream.""I don't understand."She bites her tongue as she thinks."Would you rather live eighty years in a dream, or a single day in reality?""...I would want the choice.""That's something I can't give you."She scowls and throws her arms up in the air."This is a fucking mess!"She takes a handful of deep breaths, calming a little."I didn't want to wake you at all.And if you'd only run like I'd told you...They couldn't have woken you, if they couldn't catch you."She frowns, her face looks pained."But now you are awake..." she continues, pulling a lever.There's a frantic whirring sound as a blur of metal instruments come down from the ceiling, plummeting toward my face.She looks at a long mirror in the wall.Her head drops."I'm so sorry.Truly.My family has been watching your dreams for years.Talking to you through them.Why did I have to be the one alive when you finally woke?"She glances at the window again."But they need to know how the drugs affected your brain.I'll try to... leave something of you.I promise.Now, I need you to forget me, or even if you live, they won't let you sleep again."I scream as the jagged blade begins to slice into my head."Why couldn't you just run?"---

"Good morning," says the woman behind the counter.She's pretty, with a blonde ponytail and thick, black rimmed glasses.She looks kind of familar."Coffee?"she asks.She's looking at me strangely, as if seeing into my soul through looking-glass eyes.It's a questioning look."Just a decaf," I say, massaging my head."Got a hell of a headache.I feel like death.""It'll pass, hun.You'll be okay.""You new here?"I ask."You're not the usual lady.""First day on the job!Parents' have lived around here for generations, though.She smiles at me, and for some reason, I find it incredibly reassuring.

Maria fumbled for the keys in her bag, eventually finding the heart shaped keyring her husband had given to her long ago.How long exactly, she couldn't quite remember.The lock clicked.A monotonous buzzing greeted her, as if a giant hornet had taken up residence in their home since she'd left for work."Honey?"she called out."Are you okay?"No reply.She stepped into the lounge and was met by an unpleasent, smoky smell.The buzzing had intensified too.It was a sound she now recognised, but hadn't heard for a long, long time.An electric razor.Maria frowned, a little annoyed that Peter was likely removing his thick, flowing beard.There was something she loved dearly about it -- the white hairs that shot through the blond reminded her of sunlight bouncing gleefully off an icy waterfall.It suited a physicist.It suited *him*.*buzzzz*

The living room table was a mess of cigarettes and empty beer bottles -- Peter had clearly enjoyed his day off.A folded page of a newspaper wafted up and down in the gentle breeze from an open window.*buzzz*

Maria moved idly to the table, picking up first the cigarette remains, then dropping them on the carpet as the face in the paper stared up at her, her husband's keen eyes meeting her own.His face was clean shaven, and his wrinkles softened -- but there was no mistaking him.Her hands shook as she picked it up and read.> Master Particle.Prior to Reworking's alterations.Considered the greatest physicist of his generation.But another talent wasted by the great 'hero'.This paper says Reworking is not the answer!We're the only paper brave enough to print a picture like this and...

She stopped reading.Something was wrong: there was no sound."Welcome home, *Maria*."Maria gulped as she turned to see the man in the paper standing behind her."Sweetheart..."

 "Is it really Maria?No, of course it isn't.It doesn't matter now though.""I didn't ..."

 "I was great, you know.The greatest, they say.I could have changed the world.Now I teach school children basic astrophysics.The order of the planets -- and they can't even get that right without a pathetic mnemonic to aid them.My life -- or at least many years of it -- has been wasted.Can you imagine if they'd lobotomised a young Eistein?Where would we be?"He slowly removed a knife from his jacket pocket."*Please.*"

 "How long until you were done spying on me, *darling*?Until you left me!I loved you *so* much.In my mind, you loved me, too.But only in my mind!It's all a Goddamned lie!You'll pay for that deceit, I promise you.""Please, Peter.In my mind, I love you too.*I do!* I don't know what's happened.I don't understand any of this."He grinned as he stalked forward."Oh, *you know*.You're here to watch over me.To report back to them each day, when I think you're working, so you can all laugh at me.*Mock me.* The great, *impotent*, Master Particle."*"I always loved y..." *

The knife was sharp and cut her throat cleanly and easily.She didn't scream as her blood spattered the carpet.Maria's body fell next to the fallen cigarette remains.---

It was an hour later, as Peter drank greedily from a clear bottle, his boots resting on his dead wife's carcass, that a gust from the open window turned the newspaper's page.Peter leaned forward, his eyes wide.He snatched the paper up.He read silently twice over, then mumbled a litany of *no's*.Finally, he swore bloody revenge on the world itself.He looked down at his wife through bleary eyes, scalding tears spilling down his cheeks.How could this have happened?His life had been perfect -- *twice!* Now he could never go back... *could he*?He knelt over Maria and gently pressed his trembling lips against her forehead.Peter could feel his mind buzzing; could see the sparks leaping from his hands.He felt in tune with the universe's tempestuous vibrations, and he knew in that moment, exactly what he was capable of:

*The end of everything.*

Peter got to his feet and looked at the paper a final time.> At least they had the decency to erase his wife's -- his assistant Scarlett (pictured above) -- mind, and to keep them together in their new lives.But this paper, this reporter, says it's not enough!It's time to end Reworking.---

I ran my finger along the frayed volumes until I found the single, ancient tome I was searching for.As I plucked it from its shelf, a plume of dust exploded around me, forcing me to step back, coughing and wheezing.I half expected a wizard to appear as the ephemeral fog settled on the ground.There was nothing there, of course, apart from the ornately carved bookshelf.The book was a burnt brown and whilst still a thick volume, was noticeably lighter than my own had been.My own... *my own book of death*.A biography that charted my life up to now.Up to stumbling upon the Library of Threads and closing the door after me, accidentally locking myself inside.I knew why the entries stopped where they did, after me finding the library.*I knew I wasn't getting out of here*.There was only one door, and it wouldn't budge no matter how hard I rammed my shoulder against it.The book in my hands had that musty, comforting smell all old books tend to have.I blinked back my tears, determined to distract myself from my rumbling stomach and dry throat.I placed the book down on the floor and sat in front of it, legs folded, flipping it open to the appendix.Thousands of names were listed.Dozens of other *Karens*, even.It took a moment to find my surname.There must have been a mistake.*Hundreds of pages were attributed to me*.This person that I couldn't even recall meeting, who had only had a single line in my own book, had hundreds of pages on me.It must be a different Karen that shared my surname.*It wasn't.* 

I began to read.>"Mind if I join you?"said Karen, as she approached the building's ledge.The fading sun cast a pastel orange over the street below, softening the city's imperfections, and turning the more pleasing sights into *objet d'art*.>The man glanced over his shoulder.He was pale, and there was a sheen over his face as if he was ill. Karen didn't notice.>"Free world," he said, shrugging.>The concrete felt cold and rough under Karen as she sat down next to him.She swung her legs around, so that they dangled besides his.>"Karen, by the way," she said, before waiting for a response that didn't come.>"Not the best spot for fishing," she attempted, lighting a cigarette.She offered the box to the man; he raised a hand and shook his head.>"You don't mind if I do?"she said, already puffing a hazy mist over the city."Chilly up here.">For a while, they sat silently watching the beams of the headlights sail by far below.Then, the man spoke.>"You ever think about leaning forward and"--he clapped his hands--"*splat*?">"*Splat?*" Karen frowned."No, not really.Maybe of falling in general, occasionally.Of what the wind would feel like against my face, and that rush you'd get for a few seconds.I wonder what pose I'd do... Superman, I guess.It's the classic.">"I think about it sometimes.">"...had a rough day?">The man sighed."Yeah.I got some bad news.">"Sorry to hear that.">"Thanks.">Karen took another puff.>"So.What news?">"... got a problem with my liver.">"Oh, what kinda problem?">"Cancer.">"Oh."Karen turned and looked at the man.She finally noticed how pale he looked.How worn out.Like a piece of elastic stretched to the point of tearing.Then she noticed his hands.The silver band around his finger.>"You've not told her yet?">The man looked at Karen, then down at his ring."No.I was just... *I don't know*.">"Got kids?">"Yeah.Little girl," he said proudly.He opened his jacket and pulled out his wallet.There was a picture of a kid, couldn't have been more than six, grinning broadly.>"She's cute.">"Takes after her pop," the man joked.>"If you say so!">"It's just... it'll be hard for them, you know.To watch a slow decline.All the treatments.All the hope, you know?It'll just make it worse in the end.">"Be harder losing a father when they might not have to.">"...maybe.">"You kidding?You can't really think-"

>He shook his head."I don't know.">"If I was your daughter, I sure as hell would want my pop to fight for me.To never give up on me.It's what dads do.">Karen patted him on his back, then glanced at her watch."Shit, I got to get back to work.See you around."I felt scolding tears spill down my cheeks as I flicked forward a few pages.He told them.His wife held his hand as he entered the hospital to begin chemotherapy.I skipped a few more.Then a few hundred.I landed on, and read, the entire chapter on his daughter's graduation.He was so proud.He was somehow prouder still, on the day he walked her down the aisle.Then, I came across another section with my name in it.My hands began to tremble as I read.>Perhaps it was serendipity that drew David to the Thread Library, and to Karen.>Perhaps it was simply fate that allowed David to save Karen, this time around.>"Hello?Is anyone here?"he yelled as he stepped inside.>Fate that he found her sitting there, weeping, in front of the ancient tome.That he was able to take her hand and lead her out of the library.My hands trembled as I closed the book and held my breath.*Hoping.*

*Praying.*

Two hundred pounds sat patiently in a manilla envelope on a bedside table, until Richard Bankwest awoke and shook them out.His name was scrawled across the front of the envelope in an unfamiliar hand.The handwriting was poor.Childlike, Richard thought.Where had it come from?He hadn't the foggiest.There was no note attached.No real explanation.Did someone owe him money?Not that he could recall.He put the money in a cabinet, in case the rightful owner came looking for it, perhaps realising their mistake.Then, he all but forgot about the event -- and the money -- for almost an entire month after.January passed, as it always did for Richard: the English winter stretching interminably, like a sheet of ice suffocating the ocean, until eventually swallowed by the horizon.He worked.It was at a call centre, and it wasn't a job he liked.Elderly people would ring up and ask if they'd qualified for this money or for that money, and Richard would tell them no, and that they couldn't have any government assistance, and then they'd get upset.Or angry.It was easier to dismiss the angry callers.The sad ones... they stayed with him for at least the day, sometimes creeping into his nights, too.It wasn't that he cared.He didn't.But they barged into his dreams like unwelcome family when trying to watch the football.A new colleague offered him something to help him with the dreams.With the stress.He refused politely.There was only one other strange incident in February.One event that was a tiny bit unusual for Richard.He'd lost a day.An *entire* day.He'd taken it as annual leave, apparently.That's what the computer told him.And yet... he couldn't remember booking it, or what he even did with it.Although... his arm was sore for the two days after, as if he'd slept on it funny.Still, in a life as uneventful and lonely as Richard's, a lost day was neither here nor there.He could lose them all, for all he cared.And so, he went back to his phone and picked up the receiver, and listened to another elderly person drone on about how cold it was this winter, and how they couldn't afford to put the heating on.Listen to them beg for help that he couldn't give and didn't want to.It was the start of February when he found another manilla envelope resting next to his bed.He took first a gulp, then his time, then the envelope, and finally another gulp as he tore it open and the money drifted out of the envelope like autumn leaves.Eight hundred this time -- and with it, a note.> Richard.Had a blast last month, so I'm going to take it for an entire week.You kept me locked up for far too long, friend.If you can't enjoy life, someone else might as well!He placed the money with the rest of his bizarrely gained fortune, inside his bedside cabinet.*Might get a dragon try to roost in it, if I get any more of these envelopes*, he thought dryly.Dismissively.February however, passed a little differently January.Mainly because there was *less of it.*

Now, even in Richard's world, where a lost day could be accepted like a penny dropped on the floor that's not worth one's time to retrieve, a lost week (plus a heavy suntan, and a tattoo of koala on his bicep) could not be.Something was going wrong in Richard's head, and he knew it.So he told the doctor.The doctor said he was suffering from stress.That his subconscious wanted to get away from all the grey.It wanted to shine a rainbow of colour into his life.That he mustn't worry.He was still in charge.He told the doctor about the note he'd found.The doctor didn't roll his eyes, but the rest of his expression matched that of a person who desperately *wanted* to roll his eyes.It was the last day of February (night time, in fact) and Richard was an electric ball of very human nerves.He scrawled a desperate letter and placed it on his bedside table, begging this body snatching Santa to take pity on him.> I don't care for your money.Please stop taking my body.It's *mine*.The whiskey helped him sleep.Eventually.The note he found in the morning made him pick up the bottle again.> You don't take care of yourself, Richard.You certainly don't make the most of your life.I'm taking two weeks this month.I have given you two thousand pounds for two weeks.That is far more than your life is worth, I think you'll agree.Quit your job, and enjoy the two weeks every month.If you do not... well, this is your last chance to live, Richard.He called in sick that morning, as he held the phone to his ear with one trembling hand, and the whiskey bottle in another.He blacked out two hours later.It was Valentine's day when he awoke.Drugs.There were drugs in his apartment.Clear, plastic bags full of white powder.Had... had he bought them?He couldn't have.It must be this... *other* him.He flushed them down the toilet as best he could, the powder misting the room and reddening his eyes.He staggered into work, pale and thin and with two more tattoos to his name.He begged for his job back -- apparently he'd quite thirteen days ago.It was reluctantly granted.His boss hated to see grown men crying.Richard found it a relief to sit back down in his booth and answer the calls he'd used to hate.For the first time in a long time, he even tried *helping* the caller.Giving other numbers to call for advice and such.For the first time he could remember, he cared about something.The next two weeks he *did* remember, even if they were a white haze of doctors and psychiatrists at the weekends, of work and precipitation drugs during the days, and of alcohol and cigarettes during the nights.It was the end of March, when he scribbled his final note, in a hand that looked as if it had been written during an earthquake.> Please.I want my life back.I love life, even if maybe sometimes I don't -- didn't -- fully appreciate.But I'll start dating -- I signed up to a website last week!I'll join a gym soon, too.It's *my* life.Please, give it back.Then blackness.Then eight hours later, light.> *No.*

There was no money this time.Nothing.Richard happened to glance at the clock.It was almost midnight.Then he saw the date.April the thirtieth.He began to cry, his lips trembling, until they didn't.Until they struck a switch-blade smile.Until his eyes shone and his body took a deep, relaxing breath.

It was seeing his own reflection in the blood, as it pooled over the faux-wood linoleum, that triggered the memory.As Henry examined the slick red version of his face.For that moment, he was ten again, tearing open wrapping paper, a young mind full of excitement and possibilities.Not a middle aged man who'd just murdered his wife during an argument, bringing it to an abrupt close.Another argument, but the same as always."You're lazy.Why won't you get a real job?"and the one that stretched the elastic band back until it snapped, "I'm leaving you."> *"Wow, mom!How'd you get it?Tom says these things are sold out everywhere!"His mom replied, but she'd already become a hazy background buzz, as excited fingers grappled with smooth red plastic, pulling it down over his head.A swoosh in his ears as the menu opened.*

Frying pan had hit skull.Skull had hit floor.Regret had hit Henry almost as hard and at least as fast.Now though, staring at the glossy reflection, it all made sense.His grey life, devoid of color.The nights -- and days -- wasted drinking or binging Netflix.The opportunities untaken, untested, that he'd dismissed with a wave of his hand, because, of course, there would always be more.And now this.> *The choices were limited.Explore a city.A boat down the Nile.Excitement was already draining away and the thought of Lego growing more enticing.*

These weren't the lucid sensible decisions of someone living life knowing that this was their very only shot at it.They were the choices - mistakes - of someone who knew it was all fake.A game.One of many attempts.His world was a construction of imagination.Somehow, he'd just forgotten.Until now.He crouched down and ran his hand through the blood, bringing two fingers to his face, painting the memory of the VR unit over his eyes.There.Now he was ready."Goodbye Marie.Maybe we'll do this again, sometime.But better, you know?Let's be real, I was always meant for better things."It was a relief.A crushing weight lifted.Not just of the murder -- this life been pressing down on him since long before.He strode purposefully into the kitchen, the first scent of hope drifting up his nose since...Since when?Since the wedding?Or, since that day when he was ten years old.He grabbed a knife from a drawer.The VR unit wouldn't come off easily.He'd have to pry it off his eyes.> *"Done already, sweetie?Did you have fun?"*

> He hadn't.The VR city had made him feel sick.And it was boring, anyway.He'd never end up in such a grey world.He had pulled the device off his head and shrugged dismissively."It was okay."> "Maybe you should give it more of a chance?"> He rolled his eyes.Why bother?There would always be other play-things, other chances.He dropped down to his knees and grabbed the next present.Maybe there would be Lego.

As Tutrig awoke,    
He first thought it a joke,      
That the night before was so clear.But with a cold creeping sweat,      
He did recollect,       
How the Dwarves had rung in New Year.Satmoc Minebane,       
Had drunk all the champagne,      
And went streaking down through the hall.Yolack thought it a lass,      
Complimented that ass,       
But got more than he bargained for.As for Sanmolda,       
She lowered her shoulders,       
As she watched her husband be kissed.Although a mistake,      
His trousers did quake,       
Satmoc had stolen her bliss.With swift resolution,        
She found a solution,      
As she sharpened the blade of her axe.First she did trim,       
But her hair was still grim,      
So for the first time, a dwarf did wax.When Yolack saw her,      
He said 'wife I adore ya,      
I forgot 'bout the goods under there.'But Sanmolda did scolder,    
Shoved him up by a boulder,      
Said 'I'm more than what's under my hair!''Lover forgive me,      
I know I'm no Gimli,      
I'm begging you please take me back.''Only if you do the same...If you can handle the pain,       
Of waxing each crevis and crack.'Tutrig remembered,      
The tears that descended,      
The face of a man full of fear.He reached for a bottle,       
His memory he'd throttle,     
Of another damned Dwarven New Year.

"Please Alex, we need your help", whimpered the hulking, wolf-like creature sitting at my doorstep."The survival of my kind balances on a precipice - should we fall, it would mean our extinction."A vestige of saliva dribbled down its mouth and quickly became lost in its shaggy coat.I should have slammed the door on it, or called the police or, well, just about *anything* other than what I did."Would you like a cup of tea?"I asked, as I gestured it inside.I never knew why I said it, but perhaps it was because I felt pity for the wretched thing.Its fur was drenched from the night's rain and it was shivering terribly; in its huge cobalt eyes, I swear I saw tears welling.The weight of the world seemed to rest on this creature's broad shoulders.It pushed itself up with its front paws onto its great hind-legs.It walked slowly towards me, its breath wafting up my nostrils and signalling that the end was fast approaching.But I was wrong; the creature leaned forward and put two great paws around my shoulders.Then, it licked me.It's slobbering tongue, the texture of damp sand-paper, ran up my face from chin to ear.I stood paralysed as he strode through the doorway.Saliva dribbled down my cheek, before falling off and exploding onto the floor."Thank you," he said, as he shook himself dry over my imitation Persian rug.I grimaced."My name is Driptooth," he continued."Mind if I..." he asked, pointing towards my armchair."I'd prefer if you-" but he'd already leapt onto it; he quickly curled up, wrapping his tail around him for warmth."What do you know of the five universes?"he asked, as he wiggled his bottom deeper into the seat."The five..."

"You do know of the five universes, do you not Alex?""I-  I don't even know what *you* are," I snapped."I sure as hell don't know what you're going on about!You seem to be some kind of very well-spoken, lilac-furred, *wolf creature*, that *somehow* knows my name - and that I've very foolishly let into my home.You've practically ruined my best seat and you're probably going to eat me.Or perhaps I'm just imagining things, in which case I must have some kind of head-condition and I need to urgently visit my local GP!""Calm down, Alex," it said, in a deep, soothing voice."Take a seat.Let me explain."Its tone and intonation were somewhat hypnotic, and I found myself drifting over to the sofa opposite Driptooth."Your universe is not alone.There are more - four more, to be precise.""Of course..." 

He snarled and I quickly shut up."Each universe is missing one of the creation elements.Water, Earth, Fire, Air, or Magic.My universe is missing Water.""You have no water?Then how are you even dribbling?"My head was swimming."Let's just say, it's not water.""Wait, did you say *magic?*"

He growled again."Yes.Each universe lacks an element.Your lacks magic.That's how I got here, of course - although it should **never** be used in that way!"He bared his teeth and seemed angry with himself."Oh.Of course.Magic's a thing."He held a paw out in front of him and uttered inaudible words.Suddenly, there was a rather sharp looking rock resting on his paw."You... created a rock?""I transported it," he corrected."And it's a *scratching* stone."Even as he said the words, he'd begun rubbing it deep into his fur.Dribble oozed out of his mouth like water from a tap in desperate need of a plumber."Okay!"I shouted, hoping to protect my armchair from a further downpour."I get it.You can...magic.""Yes!And as you can see, *I* can do it even in your universe, although not to the same extent.Alex," He began to speak softly, "I have travelled a long way and risked much to seek your help.""You came all the way here for me?Why?""In each universe there is a master of a single element - a creature that can use it and manipulate it like no other.In this universe, you are that person.""I'm...I'm just a fire-fighter," I replied."I can't do anything special.""Ah-ha!"he exclaimed, as he leapt out of his seat and onto his hind legs."I *knew* you were the right person.Although you had me wondering for a while!"He let out a loud, satisfied howl; ornaments and pictures began to shake."How can I be the right person?"I asked in disbelief."Because you fight fire, of course."He sighed, and sunk back down into the armchair."Two of the four universes have made an alliance.They now control all five elements, and together have already wiped life from one universe.They are intent on doing the same to mine.Once they have destroyed us, they will destroy you.""I'm very sorry, but what can *I* do?""They use fire against us.My family - entire species - will burn if you do not help me. ""You think **I** can stop it?""If you can't," he let out a high pitched whimper and looked down at the floor."I guess....I guess I could try," I said.He leapt up and licked my face.

Sarah sighed as the alarm screeched at her from across the bedroom.She cursed herself, as the neon-green light flashed "5:30", for placing it so far away.The Sun hadn't even risen yet, so why should she?"I got it," said a voice.Her husband, David, rolled out of bed and walked over to the alarm.He ran a wave of salt-and-pepper hair back over his head as he tried to work out how to turn off the alarm.Sarah raised a hand in protest."That was for my work -- you don't need to be up.""I kind of do.This was keeping me awake.""Sorry," she said, with little feeling behind it."There, you little bastard!"he cried triumphantly as the beeping finally stopped.The alarm's silence only revealed the crying of a baby -- Sarah let out her second sigh of the day."I got that too," said David as he put on his dressing-gown and headed to the door."You try to get another ten minutes, okay?You need it way more than I do.Breakfast will be ready when you are."It was true that she needed it.She hadn't been sleeping well.Or doing anything well, for that matter.Life had become so... grey, since Thea had been born.So hard and tedious and stupid.It always felt like she was mentally trudging through thick porridge.The crying stopped and Sarah allowed herself a deep breath.She wouldn't get back to sleep now, but at least she could lay down and do nothing for a few minutes.Think of nothing.Pretend to be nothing.The alarm began to beep.Snooze.He'd hit god-damned snooze.Twenty minutes later, she was mostly-dressed and eating breakfast, forcing sloppy scrambled eggs into her mouth and down into her stomach.She wondered why she bothered eating at all.Maybe to please David, she thought.Not much she did pleased him anymore.Or vice-versa, in truth.Her husband held Thea in one arm and her car-keys in his free hand."I'll get her strapped in then I'll come grab you.""You don't need to give me a lift," Sarah protested."I'm fine driving.""No offence, but you don't look fine.Those rings around your eyes... Did you sleep at all?"A shudder of rage rippled up Sarah's spine."I said I'm fine.Just... Go watch Netflix or something until you need to leave.I'll drop Thea off at Mom's before work."---


The black cloak of the creature seated at the front of the courtroom made him look a little like how Sarah imagined Death would dress.The fact that he had a skeletal face almost convinced her that that was indeed who it was.However, he referred to himself as the Adjudicator, and her lawyers swore the two weren't even related.The room was filled to the wooden rafters with jeering men, women, children, demons, skeletons, and a host of creatures that Sarah didn't like to look at.They looked like how she felt inside.The crowd were loud and baying for blood, and Sarah knew it was for hers in particular.She hoped they'd get it."Order," came the voice of the Adjudicator."Order!"He slammed down his gavel and a tsunami of silence washed over the crowd behind her.Sarah was seated near the front, with her lawyer -- a two headed demon called Mary-and-Sue, who was biting her nails nervously with both mouths.The lawyer paused long enough to whisper to Sarah, "It's okay, sweetie.They can't prove you did it on purpose.Which you didn't, remember?"Her other head, Sue, butted in, "And if in doubt, always remember that you *can't* remember."With that, the creature's hands jammed back into its mouths.Sarah shook her head."I really don't remember though.I was just driving and..." She would have cried if she were able, but that ability had died long before she had."I just want to be sentenced fairly.That's all.If I did what I'm accused of then let me rot in Hell forever."She'd been waiting in purgatory for what felt like forever already.Whether guilty or not in court, she wanted this over with.She knew what had happened as a result of her actions.Hell seemed a more than fair outcome."Shh!"hissed Mary-and-Sue."Let's not give the Adjudicator any ideas!"As if he'd heard his name, the Adjudicator glanced at Sarah."Let us begin today's proceedings," he said.His voice rumbled around the room, as if a giant were speaking into a barrel."Purgatory versus Sarah O'Manahue.Charges: suicide and infanticide.""Minor charges really," whispered Sue."She doesn't mean minor as in child..." said Mary."She knows what I mean.""Silence!"said the Adjudicator."Or I will find you in contempt of this court!""Sorry!"cried Mary-and-Sue.The Adjudicator nodded slowly."Mister Hyde," he said, looking at a man with a sharp pinstripe suit and an even sharper smile sitting adjacent to Sarah, on the other side of the court room."Would you like to bring out your first witness for the prosecution?""Gladly," said Mister Hyde, as he got to his feet and slicked back his black hair."Our first witness is the defendants very own husband.David O'Manahue."

"*Bang, bang*, **bang**!"shouted the old man in torn, mismatched clothing.His index fingers were pressed together and pointing at my purse.Then, he cupped his hands over his mouth and made a hideous guttural sound, followed by a few deep breaths.Bad ventriloquism."There you go madam," he said gruffly."You're safe now."In the darkness of the alley, the silhouette of his hands had looked a little like a gun, and I'd reluctantly acquiesced to the mugging by throwing my purse on the ground.Only now, with my eyes adjusted to the dark, I realised I'd been mistaken.There had been no mugging - just a scrawny old man with a screw or two lose, thinking he was doing some good."Uh... thanks," I stuttered, walking over to my purse."Maybe I can get you a coffee or something, to repay you for your kindness.""I'm just doing my duty as a citizen of the Orion alliance.No reward is necessary."I saw his tongue dart out and wet his cracked lips."Although, a thank you pastry wouldn't be, erm, *unacceptable*.""Oh.Okay, well, there's a bakery around the corner," I replied, picking up my purse."I'm Elizabeth.What's your name?"He paused for a moment as he thought."Derek," he said, finally.The street was dark and quiet, hushed by the Sunday night blues.Boris' Bakery however, was as open as always.I pushed the door and held it open for my new friend to enter through.There was no one behind the counter, but the sweet scent of freshly baked bread came drifting out from the back.There wasn't much choice available at this hour, but Derek was already pawing at the glass counter, salivating at the sight of half stale Danish pastries."Have anything you want.Hell, have a few things.I owe you big time," I said, smiling politely.Poor guy needed a good meal.I hadn't really noticed his smell before, but now we were in an enclosed space, Derek's strange odour was becoming prominent.But it wasn't the smell of body odour or urine.It was something else.Something I recognised but couldn't put my finger on.Maybe a little sulphurous.I opened my handbag and looked in my purse, wanting to make sure I had enough money to pay for the feast I felt certain Derek would be ordering.There was a hole in my purse!- about an inch and a half in diameter.Most of my coins had already escaped through it, but some were still trickling out into my handbag like a nickel waterfall.But more worrying than that, was the black substance coalescing around the hole, bubbling and stretching, as if trying to heal over a wound."*Don't trust him,*" came the gurgled whisper from my purse."What the-"

Derek turned."Ey?""Oh, erm, nothing.I was just checking my phone.Ex says he wants to meet up.It was a bit of a surprise.""Ah, probably just a booty call," said Derek, as he went back to the counter, peering down through the glass and licking his lips."That's probably it," I murmured in agreement, gazing back down into my handbag."Run," my purse pleaded.I lowered my voice and whispered a reply."*What are you?*"

"I'm the last of my kind.He - we call him the Coin Collector - has been hunting us for millennia.He's going to kill me, then he's going to kill you.Run.Now!""Kill me?"I replied, swallowing hard.I hadn't heard Derek moving, but his voice made me jump in surprise."So that fucking animal is still alive," he growled.I turned to see him by the door, blocking the exit."Well, that's a shame, cause..." he pressed his hands together forming a finger gun, "I was just starting to like you."He aimed his fingers toward me.A booming cry of "flour power!"erupted behind us.The small white bag twisted in the air, sprinkling the floor with its sweet, powdery snow.It struck Derek's hands like a rock, knocking them down to his side."You just made a big mistake, threatening a customer in *my* bakery," boomed Boris, a long baguette in his hands.The burly baker was out from behind the counter as quick as a whippet, holding the baked good in front of him like a crusty sword.Derek stumbled backward as the blow of the bread stick struck his left temple.His eyes became a cloud of red, and his lips twisted and distorted into something unnatural - demonic, even.Behind them, jagged teeth were starting to protrude."Fool!"he spat, as he grabbed a stale loaf of sourdough by its plastic sheath.He swung it in front of him, every bit as menacing as a mace."Shit!"cried Boris, as the crusty uppercut sent him sprawling to the floor.The creature was on him in a flash, sinking his teeth deep into the baker's forehead; a mist of red exploded to the ceiling.I grabbed a hot cross bun from the shelf and flung it at the monster, hoping the religious symbol would somehow wound it - but it bounced off its back, seemingly causing little harm at all."Run!"screamed my purse."Your coin pouch is right, lady - I can't hold him off much longer!"screamed Boris, his arms flailing hopelessly as he struggled against the creature.The smell of blood and flour mingled perversely in the air."**Run!**"

The bell jangled behind me as I fled into the street; Boris' screams chased me like the wind as I ran."Oh god," I cried."No time for that," said my purse stoically."We've got to get to the night-bank before it closes - I've got a withdrawal to make that might just save our lives!Then, we'll repay the Coin Collector, *with interest*."I rolled my eyes, then hurried toward the bank.---

"Put down y-your weapon, Baron Munchausen!"I yell, as loudly as I can.He doesn't even hear me.For a moment I think of giving up, but only for a *moment*.The blurred faces of the innocent crowd around us; the towering spires of the great city in the distance; the God-damned air we're all breathing!I have to keep going.One step at a time, one movement of my cane at a time, I near him."Put down your weapon, Baron Munchausen!"I repeat, as sternly as my cigarette-roughened voice will allow.This time, the costumed man turns to me.His cape flaps like a newspaper in the wind."Go home, old man," he says, grinning.He's always grinning.Why is it that he didn't grow old like me?Life never seems to be fair."Put down the sword," I command.He laughs.The crowd laughs.*Fools, can't they see that I'm trying to save them!*

He swishes and swashes the weapon in my direction, its radiance almost blinding me.He's taunting me.I raise an arm protectively over my eyes.At any moment, he could kill us all - he could release a ball of pure energy into their midst.I have to do something."Last chance,  Baron Munchausen!"I tell him.Another laugh.The crowd are jeering and yelling, but I can't process it all.Something about him putting on an act?He always was convincing."You watch too much tv, old man.Go home!"My arm trembles as I reach into my jacket pocket and retrieve my gun.I point it towards him.He's not laughing anymore.There are screams from the crowd - they know I mean business.People run.Sensible.He drops the sword.Its light flickers, then dies."I'm - I'm sorry," he utters.His tights are becoming damp.Something's not right, but I can't think straight.I have to save the city."Too late.I've given you so many chances in the past, and you've squandered each and every one of them.This has to end.I'm sorry."The nurse accompanies me in the police car.She says its not my fault, that I shouldn't have been able to get out.She asks where I got the gun from.Why isn't she more grateful?I saved her.I saved them all!"I want to go home," I inform her."My tv program starts soon."Her lip quivers and her eyes moisten.

Cutulah was first to arrive, as usual.The cellar was empty, but she busied herself by lighting candles, setting up the board and then finally, pouring herself a drink from the huge oak barrel.She glanced at her palm, as if the lines that trailed it told her secrets they shared with no one else.Then she looked at the door.Still no one.With a sigh, she swivelled off her stool and got down onto her knees.The corners were usually the best place to find what she was after.Cobwebs worked too, although their contents couldn't be *that* old.If too many legs were missing, it wouldn't be much fun.It only took a few minutes to gather, what she considered, a rather good haul.She got back to her feet, her hands cupped and full, and walked over to the board.Dead insects fell like black sleet onto the tiny, idyllic suburb."Ten gold pieces on the beetles!"shouted Burric, clapping his hands as he walked in.Cutulah looked up at the barbarian.He was wearing fur around his groin, a sword around his back, but little else.*Wasn't he cold?* Cutulah didn't mind too much.His tanned, chiselled features made her for a second, ashamed; she ran a finger down a thin, pale cheek.Jateex the Goblin King trotted in next, his skull boots clicking and clacking on the stone floor."Oh, a little pre-game fun?Excellent.Excellent.Fifty on the spiders!"he said, settling down onto a stool, his beady eyes following the frantic back and forth battle."Come on, dung beetle!Snap their legs!"yelled Burric."Aye, that's the way!Chase 'em, chase 'em!*No*, not into the web!Ach, idiot."A cold wind spiralled around the cellar, announcing the final arrival.The long legged Dark Elf glided through the doorway and over to the table.She tutted when she saw the scene, then waved a hand over the battling insects.They fell into a dead slumber."What did ya do that for, woman!?"roared Burric, slamming his fist on the table.The insects jumped a final time, as if performing a sordid curtain call.Llenynea rolled her eyes."Please.I'm not here for *battling bugs.* Reanimation is the lowest form of entertainment."There was a palpable disdain in her voice.Cutulah's lips twitched but she said nothing.Instead, she left her seat again, and poured three drinks.One for the Barbarian, one for the Goblin King, and a refill for herself.Llenynea placed a bag on the table, a bag as black as the sky outside the castle.She clicked it open and removed a sleek, long necked jar that shone far brighter than the candles."Is that..." began Jateex, his mouth dribbling."Nectar, yes.With a little something extra.I would offer it around, but it would probably kill any of you, my friends."It was Cutulah's turn to roll her eyes, but in truth, a pang of jealousy in her stomach was letting itself be known.She'd never tasted nectar before -- not even the bastardised diluted stuff -- and probably never would."Shall we begin?"said Burric, clapping his hands together excitedly."I feel like a dwarf whose been away away from his axe for a month.A wizard away from his weed pipe.Let's get going!"There was a murmur of excited agreement.Cutulah held out four cards face down.She offered them first to Jateex.His hand darted for one of the middle two cards, but then he stopped suddenly before taking, looked up slyly at Cutulah, and changed to the card on the left."Suburbs!"he shouted joyfully."You thought Jateex, dumb!Jateex *not* dumb!"Cutulah moved her hands over to Burric."Ah, SUV's," he said, clicking his tongue in annoyance.Cutulah let out a sigh of relief.No matter what happened, she wouldn't have to team with the stuck up Elf again.Things had ended rather *dangerously* the last time they had tried working together...Finally, she offered the remaining two cards to Llenynea.The Dark Elf waved her hands over the cards, slowly moving her palms back and forth from one to the other."Wait!"yelled Burric."Anyone else feel that breeze?A breeze like"--he turned and glared suspiciously at the elf--"*like darkness and ice*.""A natural subterranean wind, I imagine," said Llenynea."Cellars do get draughty, after all.""Neh!Jateex felt it too," said the Goblin King."*Unnatural.* Elf already try to cheat!""Preposterous!"Cutulah frowned, then shuffled the two cards."Take your pick," she said."*Quickly.*

Llenynea growled and snatched the left card.She placed the SUV card face up on the table."Right," said Burric."Let's begin."

I slept on the sofa again last night.It's easier to pretend they're still here, that way.That Maria never left me, we just argued and that she's lying up there in our bed, and in the morning we'll sort out our differences over a cup of tea.That's what I do.I make two cups of tea in the morning.Sometimes I even pour a glass of orange for Mark, but in truth, it's harder to pretend he's still here.Because I *know* he's gone.It was just a prank, you know.Mark fell in love with the books.I started reading them to him when he was six.A bit young maybe.It was Mark that believed they were real.There was no deception on my part, not at that time.But, in the way kids so willingly believe in Santa, he believed in Harry and Hogwarts and all of it -- believed it was all real.Why not *let him* believe it, at least for a while?Fuck, I know what it's like to be an adult in a world without any magic.It sucks.So yeah, I let him believe.I started to encourage him, even.I'd tell him about how a news event was really to do with the Ministry of Magic, or some such.But that most muggles didn't understand, and thought it was just an unusual storm.That only him and me knew the truth.The books had a good moral.So what was the harm in pretending?By the time he was nine... Maria wanted me to explain it to him.That it was just a book, and that J. K. Rowling wasn't an archivist of magical affairs, but the writer of this made up fantasy world.*I couldn't.* 

I just didn't want to burst his bubble.Later, as he got older...I admit I got something of a kick out of it.Like, when I faked the letter.*Ah, shit*.This is tough to talk about.When I faked the letter, I did everything I could not to burst out laughing when he exploded into our room and shared his thrilling news.Maria just glared at me.It was my idea to take him to the station.I was going to show him... yeah, through a practical joke, I was going to demonstrate to my son, that none of it was real.It was going to be both hilarious, but also kind of tragic, when he ran into the pillar.I had the camera ready, you know.Because I'm a complete and utter twisted fuck up.I wanted to capture his face.To show his future girlfriends.His future wife.I'm so fucking sorry Mark.The day came.He dressed up in all his garbs and was so excited about quidditch and the wand and the alley, and all the fucking rest of it.He ran face first into the pillar.And he slipped away.Straight through to the other side.Yeah.I got a picture as his head thudded against it.As it hit the ground.I didn't get a picture of the blood pooling around his uniform.Cause I'd realised, as my finger clicked the trigger the first time, that...

Maria blamed me, of course.Hell, I blamed me -- it was my fault, so of course I did.*I do.*

Every day is a battle now, to not follow him into that other realm.I miss you, Mark.And I love you like Dobby loves socks.

"Welcome to my humble home," said the old man, with a smile as crooked as the picture that hung behind him."Thank you," Christian replied as his gaze jumped from one piece of priceless art to another."I still can't believe you invited me," he muttered as he stared distractedly at the lifeless head of an ancient creature hung on the wall."Is that a..."

"Deer," said the old man."Deer!Yes!I've read about deer!They roamed the land with the elephants and sabre-toothed ti..tig.."

"Tiger.And you're almost correct.They were a little *after* the sabre-toothed tiger became extinct.But I'm pleased you know your history somewhat.Come, dinner will be ready shortly, and I have something I'd like you to try, beforehand."Christian marvelled at the statues and paintings that adorned the mansion, as he walked through the grand hall, down a long mahogany corridor and into a huge dining room."Wooden walls, wooden tables - it's just, mind boggling.Trees - the organic kind - they went so long ago... your house must be worth more than the entire city!"The old man smiled again."Worth isn't always in physical possessions.Sometimes, it's what's inside a person that really matters.Sit, please."Christian pulled out a chair.In front of him sat a jewelled goblet.Christian peered in and made out a strange liquid inside.Curious, he held the goblet up and sloshed the contents about - a thin, clear liquid dribbled over the edge."Water," the old man said proudly, his tongue darting out to moisten his dry lips."Water?"Christian furrowed his brow."No such thing.Not even you have access to water.""Please, take a sip.I think you'll be surprised"

Christian stared at the old man for a moment, before raising the goblet once more and tilting it towards his mouth."My God," he exclaimed wiping his mouth, "it tastes so damn pure!It's fantastic!""I'm pleased you like it.""I don't understand though.How did you procure it?There is *no* water any more.""It's... courtesy of my previous guest.""Your pre-" Christian began coughing."Yes.You see, water is very hard to get hold of.And yet, you and I are nearly all water, at a basic level.It's simply diluted with *unpleasantness*."Christian's coughing became a wheeze and he fell to his knees.He began to retch and a warm, red liquid trickled out of his mouth."So you see, I must distill it.I'm glad you got to taste it beforehand.I believe everyone should get to taste water at least once.I'm sorry yours wasn't *quite* pure, but I don't think it would have affected the taste very much."---
