It had been 16 years since the ageless started showing symptoms.When the first generation of the gained 20 lbs of muscle in a week, doctors were concerned but dismissive.Its just the body adapting to repair serum they said.After all these years they insisted it was as safe as ever.And no one really was that upset about their sudden gain in strength.Then the hallucinations started.They were minor at first.All of us seniors noticed it before they did.You could catch one staring off into space at times, straight up.If you asked them what they were looking at, it was always something similar.The light.The aurora.Bright.Those were the words they used.Less than two years later, the first accelerated case was discovered.Or rather, it discovered us.
