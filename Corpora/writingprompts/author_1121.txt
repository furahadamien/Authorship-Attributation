CafeRoaster
A dark room.A pedestal in the middle, illuminated by a pillar of light, upon which sat a thick book, pages uneven and frayed at parts.As I took it into my worn hands, I could feel the density of it.The importance.All of the sadness, the fear, the excitement, anxiety, joy, love, ambition, heartache, fulfillment, failure...This was me.Fingering the spine with one hand and the edges of the pages with the other, I closed my eyes, and opened to a random page.Child.Love.Graduation.Immense joy.To another page.Pride.Overcoming.Achievement.Another.Misfortune.Selfishness.Greed.Passion.I opened my eyes.The pages wordless.All of them.I turned to the first page.Emptiness.Stillness.This was the beginning.I understood.I thumbed a part of the page where I thought I might find her.The one beside me who never made it out.Never saw light, felt the coldness of the world.Never experienced love, grief, joy...I focused on her.I saw her.She was radiant.Beautiful.We had the same eyes.I turned ahead.There she was.She was so pure, innocent.Even at a young age, she emanated compassion and kindness.I flipped to around the halfway mark.She was a scientist.No, a philanthropist.No, a political activist.No... she was all of it.I turned several pages more.Peace.So much happiness.Not only within her, but wherever she went.Pure, innocent.Joy.She was good.The world was good because of her.Not better.Good.It was then that I knew that she was the key to bringing the world together.If only she had been born... How many others had this happened to?How better off could the world be...?I could at least help.I closed the book, laying it gently back down onto the pedestal.I looked up to the source of the light.Its warmth flooded over me.I knew that I could bask in it forever if I chose to.Instead, I gazed one last time at the book, as I backed into the shadows from where I had entered this room.The world needs Her.And I was unborn, She in my place.
