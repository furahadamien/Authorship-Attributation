I was flabberghasted.She was the one person on Earth that I didn't want to run into; yet, here she was.She'd undoubtedly seen the terror and shock in my eyes, but I attempted to hide my recognition.Immediately walking in her direction, I attempted to make it apparent that I'd been looking at someone behind her.My diversive mark was an elderly woman that was ambling across the sidewalk."Ma'am," I said, "you're the spitting image of my grandmother."She looked to me with joy in her eyes, obviously having been brushed aside in her age by all her family and friends."That's so nice, dear," she spoke, placing a hand on my shoulder."You're not fooling me, Robert," Iris said from behind me.A chill rose up my spine."I know what you've done, and I've come to put a stop to it."I slowly turned to face Iris.Her eyes were filled with fiery rage.I'd hoped for so long that she'd been a fabrication of my psyche.The countless hours that she'd pleaded with me to stop had admittedly worn away at me over the years.We both stared at each other in silent understanding, tears wavering on both our faces as the sounds of police sirens in the distance grew louder.
