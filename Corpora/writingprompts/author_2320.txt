My final breath filled the room, and I felt myself float away.I died a happy old woman, with a long life behind me.My children and grandchildren crowded the hospital room, where I lie dead, just hours after my stroke.I felt the warmth surround me, and the bright light overcome the room, until I could no more see the weary faces of my beloved family.I was able to replay, in crystal clear recollection of my happiest moments as if they were just happening.My first ice cream soda, my first date with my High-school sweetheart.My wedding and the birth of my daughter and son.I came to peace with all the hurt I had experienced, and forgave my tormentors.I was fully happy, and completely fulfilled.I was so relieved, and it felt as though a thousand pounds had been lifted from my shoulders.Pure peace is all I could describe it.Then it happened; the world seemed to regenerate and my senses were brought back to life.I felt alive but not as I had known it before.I wasnt burdened by my 90 year old ailments, and I felt a rush of innocence sweep over me.I could see, just as I could when I was a child.Good morning ladies

I turned my head to see a child, about six, sitting next to me in a pink tutu, gripping a miniature tea set.Have some tea Amy! The six year old placed an empty cup in front of where I was sitting.Across from me was a stuffed bear, and next to the Bear was a dolly, just like the one I had growing up.Needless to say I was confused.I couldnt move from the chair and my motions seemed to be limited to what the child imagined.Then it hit me.A wave of memories from when I was a child flooded my brain.Playing with my dolly and Janet, my imaginary friend.How is your tea mister snuggles? The child asked the stuffed bear, remaining unanswered.Thats lovely 

Her giggles filled the room in a way I had not experienced in years.She poured tea, cup after cup, and shared secrets with us about her day.That day went by fast, and so did the others .Sometimes her dad would join in, and would bring some crackers and jam.Other days she would make a tent out of some blankets and pretend to camp.Look at the stars! She would say as she pointed to the top of the sheets.We shared fond memories together, but as the years went on, and as Frankie went to school and made real friends my role became obsolete.Sometimes I would feel myself fade-away just as I had when I died, then a flicker of life would come back, as she fell asleep.I knew my time was up.Frankie was turning 10 tomorrow.I walked over, and gave her a kiss on her forehead, then looked to the sky and said Im ready now.

Sometimes Ill catch a glimpse of Frankies room, as she looked at old photographs of her tea parties, or her at home camping trips.My soul has served its purpose, and will soon be taking the form of another being.I hope its Frankies new dog.
