Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael finally hit the best part of their day, pizza time.The Ninja turtles chowed down in a flurry of cheese crust and discarded pizza boxes.Once they had run out, they paused for a satisfactory breath... Ahhh... Then a faint chuckle bounced off the cement sewer walls."What the heck was that?"Raphael questioned."Probably just my stomach!"Donatello chimed.Laughs and high fives spread all around.Then it happened again, this time sounding like a child, no, it was something more evil, something with deep mockery and wretchedness.Splinter awoke from his meditation advising the turtles, "I hoped this day wouldn't come."A muttering of qeustions rose, then splinter continued, "This can only be IT.""What?"The turtles said in unison."This can only be a being from decades ago that preys using fear.The worst part is he was rumored to claim these sewers as his domain.You must defeat him before he kills countless victims."The Ninja turtles leaped into action grabbing sai, bo, nunchaku, and twin katanas.Mere seconds later a grinning clown poked his head outside the sewer gate the turtles used as their exit."Hello I'm Pennywise the dancing clown," he said with  cheerful demonic emotion.The turtles charged with great speed, but pennywise was not of this world, poof he was gone."Where has that devil gone?"Asked Michelangelo.Then suddenly the TV flipped on, first static, then fox news."It seems an epidemic has plagued the world today.All pizza parlors from the smallest street vendor to the most famous Chicago deep dish have gone out of business.The sauces used round the world have been poisoned, be warned all who eat it will surly die."The images they showed next we're absolutely terrifying.People would take a bite only to have there eyes pop out of their skulls, and blood erupt from their eyes and mouth.Sputter, choke, sputter, and then death of thousands.All the turtles were frozen their greatest fear had materialized, world without pizza."I would rather die, than live in a hell of earth with no cheesy goodness or meaning."As if some force had synchronized their minds, all the turtles brutally killed themselves in one bloodbath.Splinter had no power to stop them.The rat had hardly endured such anguish, but remained strong.The rat rose to his feet bearing arms and said, "I have meditated long enough to fear nothing.You cannot kill me and I shall smite you with rightous vengeance.You can not win Pennywise."HAAAA HAAAAA HAAAAAAAAAA was the last thing to echo through the darkness with its sepulcher of stone, and wet pools of blood.Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip
