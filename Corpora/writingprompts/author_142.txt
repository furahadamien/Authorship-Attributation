I wake up to the sound of a familiar jingle coming from my phone.Groaning I turn over and turn it on.But then something grabs my interest, an official text, like the amber alerts you get sometimes, saying DO.NOT.LOOK.AT.THE.MOON.My screen then suddenly bursts up with hundreds of text messages saying the same thing, its a beautiful night tonight.Look outside.I then see the time, 3:00 am.Shit I say, still half asleep,  I have class at 7:30, aint nobody got time for trolls. I then turn back over and have a wonderful nights rest and get to class just on time.But no one is there.
