The branches of the trees hung heavy and thick above me.The sun struggled to light the path, scattered beams dancing across the damp earth as the foliage swayed in the breeze.My lungs burned.I couldnt remember how long I had been walking, but I wish I had worn better shoes.My sneakers were wet and starting to soak through.I slowed to catch my breath and wipe the beading sweat from my brow.The mud was thick and the path narrow; the canopy captured so much moisture in the air it was difficult to breathe.The canopy captured the moisture in the air, made it dense and hot.The path was poorly trodden; no creature had come this way for some time.Leafy limbs dangled in front and behind, sharing the dew they had collected since morning.I pressed on.It had been some time since I set out.It must have been since I had no memory of my origin.Come to think of it, I had no knowledge of my destination.I just knew the order of my steps, one in front of the other.Ordinarily, this would have terrified me, but today it just felt normal.I didnt know because I couldnt know.At least that is what my gut told me.After a time, I could not say how long, the forest began to thin.I could see a small clearing ahead, a clearing and movement.A shadow, slimmer and shorter than mine, drifted between the gaps in the trees.There was something else, a soft sound on the wind.At first, it was incomprehensible, a rhythmic buzzing under the weight of my steps and the drag of the branches.As I neared, it became clearer.It was a gentle humming.A melody I had not heard for some time.Then a voice.The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping, I dreamed I held you in my arms. Then more humming, followed by singing, followed by humming....hung my head and I cried. The voice was familiar to me, soothing.As I came into the clearing and had my first good look at the shadow, what breathe I had escaped me.Mom?

She sighed, There you are.Always in your own time. She gestured to the side and I truly took in the clearing for the first time.The path opened slightly into a small patch of grass and a break in the tree cover.Clear sky let a gentle sun shine down onto a weathered and worn picnic table.A large, plastic container sat to one end, its spigot hanging over the edge.Two tall glasses sat alongside.Have a seat. I did not move.You want some sun tea? she asked, walking across the clearing to the table.Mom, wh-, I had started speaking before organizing my thoughts.It had been so long.But how is that possible?I am only

Youre not as young as you think. She looked different than I last remembered.In my mind her hair was thinner, he steps shallow, and her frame thinner.She shuffled along.But here she moved assuredly; she was a little rounder and her skin smoother.She finished pouring both glasses, set one on each side of the table, took her seat, wiped her hands on her jeans, and gestured for me to sit, Come on.Weve got to talk and we dont have much time.

Mom, Ive missed you so much, I walked to my glass and straddled the bench, but I couldnt bring myself to sit.I leaned forward, putting all my weight on both hands, Its been hard without you.Why does it feel so long?

She placed her hand atop mine, I know.I wish we had more time.Time enough for me to explain, gesturing around her, this. She paused and took a deep breath.Come on; sit down and drink your tea. She smiled.Her smile looked the same.This is a waypoint, before what comes next, keeping one hand atop mine she waived the other gently as if dismissing a question I hadnt asked, I know this doesnt make any sense right now, but it will in time.Honey, she exhaled, you died.Its okay.Its okay.You lived a long life, a good life. She wiped away the tears that were rolling down her face.And she was there with you, in the end.I hoped she would be. She paused, finally taking her hand from mine.She used both to dry her face.I, uhm, I stammered, I dont understand.Im not I dont feel old.I feel

She interrupted, Young.I know.You feel young.You look, you feel the way you want to here, at least for a time. Suddenly, she stopped talking and hung her head.She nodded like she was listening to something then she turned toward the trees, Okay.I know.I know.Were getting there. Looking back toward me, Honey, something is about to happen.As I said, this is a waypoint.You cannot get to where you are going without passing through here.In a minute, Im going to leave, I tried to speak but she hastily reached forward cupping both hands atop mine, please just listen.I am going to leave and you will meet four spirits.They come together and before you they decide your path out.I do not know their names.I do not know their faces.But they will be the one to whom you were cruelest, the one to whom you were kindest, the one you saved, and, she sighed and nodded, the one you killed. She squeezed my hands tightly, Now quickly.Close your eyes.When you open them again, I will be gone and they will stand in judgment. 

I shook my head, subtly at first and then violently.I would not say good-bye.Mom implored me, Come on now.Shut them tight; I have to go. Tears streaming down my face, I lowered my head, gritted my teeth, and closed my eyes.I felt her hands grow heavy upon mine, a kiss on the forehead, and then nothing.I sat in silence for a time, trying to quiet my racing mind, waiting for someone to bid me open my eyes.Nothing came.No one called out.There were no footsteps or voices.Just the sound of wind in trees.I slowly opened my eyes.She was gone, but, in all other ways, the world seemed unchanged.I looked around.There was no one.The canopy of the forest darkened all around the clearing.My tea sat untouched and a gentle sun illuminated drew beads of sweat upon the glass.Then I saw her sitting on the earth on the other side of the table.I saw her sitting as only one can in the pristine form of memory, soft doe eyes, stout body, and stubby legs.When our eyes finally connected she hopped to all four feet; her tailed wagged so vigorously her body wiggled and wormed.I rolled to the dirt, sat with my legs out outstretch and patted the earth between them.She dashed around the table and rolled herself into the V between legs.I ran my fingers through her fur and scratched deeply on her chest and neck.She felt exactly as I remembered all those years ago.And I wept.
