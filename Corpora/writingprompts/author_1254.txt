My eyes begin to tear up.Sure my parents love me but most of the time that is never enough...

Two years ago I stood on my balcony begging my self to jump.I was slowly scumming to the black hole where my heart once resided.I thought to my self would I really be missed?No, no who would miss me.What impact have i really made on the world other than eaten my way through the local KFC?The answer was always "if we are simply born to die, why try to delay it and simply accelerate to the inevitable".That will always be the darkest part of my life where I stood on the precipice of my own mortality.The truth is my parents are the only ones that do love me and that is fine.Does it keep me from ledge?No.What keeps me going is that because I have accepted my eventual death.With that knowledge I live to the point of poverty.I leave barely enough to get by.Because in the end money doesn't matter it is simply a vehicle to have all the fun I can think of.Reddit telling me I am loved is true but they don't love me.They don't know me and if they truly ask themselves they don't really care.Not all stories are happy.Despite everything I do have a great live that I worked my butt off for.I tell my self that I am not happy because of my past but I truly am a happy person in light of my past.
