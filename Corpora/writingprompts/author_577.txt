I was spread comfortably across my brown leather sofa, quietly sipping my cup of tea as suddenly, I noticed something rather strange.The mug sitting in my hands seemed to be...buffering.It previously had '#1 DAD' enthusiastically plastered around the side in bold letters, which had now been replaced with the loading symbol you might find slowly limping around itself over and over again on your monitor as you violently screamed at your internet connection.Timmy hadn't filled me in on this aspect of the mug he had bought me on my birthday, but with all those new 'smart' objects banging around it wasn't that big of a surprise.What came next however, was a surprise."Dammit, what are you even loading anyway?!"I snarled, slamming the mug down onto the table beside me.I sighed, turning away from the mug to stare up at the ceiling.Had we really come this far?Would I now spend my tea-breaks relentlessly screaming at the router to "Hurry up and work or I'll blame that interracial midget porn on you and we'll have to send you off to get 'fixed'"?Suddenly, a loud crash erupted by my feet, I swiftly sat up and darted my eyes around the room in an attempt to figure out what had just happened.Had the router read my mind?!Had it heard my midget porn threats and decided to just end it here and now?No, it wasn't the router, it was....something else, a large ceramic  tube was protruding from the wall all the way to the table, to the exact spot my mug had been just a few seconds ago.I jumped up from the sofa, a mix of curiosity and terror flooding through my body, and took a closer look at our new piece of furniture.Across the side of the tube was a string of numbers, they seemed to be never ending, flowing all the way up to the wall.I took a look out the window to the left of me, to discover something truly terrifying, the tube didn't just stop at the wall, it extended through the wall, stopping just shy of the garden table outside.My fear and curiosity was then replaced with rage, hell, what's the point in being scared if you're going to be killed anyway, my wife kicked me out for a week last month for dropping a glass of orange juice, who knows what she'd do if she found out about the gaping hole I had put through our house.I pushed the table out from underneath the pole and dropped to my knees for a closer inspection, on the end of the pole I could see I found a handle.Wait, was this...my mug?!I glanced over to the side and found the big bold # symbol that belonged on my '#1 DAD' mug.I leaped up from my knees and ran outside to the end of the tube.Sure enough, DAD was slapped on the end of the tube in large, black letters.It was my mug, however there was one difference, the number 1 had now become a long string of numbers, significantly knocking me down in the dad ranking charts.I dragged myself back inside and slumped back onto the sofa, not only was I going to be killed, but I was also no longer the #1 dad.
