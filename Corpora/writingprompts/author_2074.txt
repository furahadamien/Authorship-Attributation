**The Nurse.**  
You know whats crazy?Unicorns.Woodland creatures that have magical horns capable of remedying any ailment, so long as they were first tamed by virgins.You know whats straight up *unbelievable*?The fact that these kids are somehow scoring smack in here.For the life of me I cant figure out how theyre doing it, and doing it daily.I cant recall a single day, *not one day*, since they were admitted that I did not find them floating around the stratosphere at least once.All three of them.Some days they are high before I even get to work, and by the time I knock off nothings changed.And when they're high, there's bound to be trouble.Like just last week, the little one, Harris, had stood in the rec room, naked as a jaybird, screaming Expelliarmus while masturbating furiously.He called his penis his wand, and Im guessing you can figure out what it was he was expelling.Even in a psychiatric ward, thats weird.But not as weird as when the girl, Heloise, joined him there.She had somehow found a dildo, god knows where from, and had followed Harris' lead.Engorio shed muttered as she twirled it around and, yes, I do believe she was trying to make it bigger.Luckily Roland was passed out on the couch at the time so there were no shenanigans from him.Not then.Thank all that is holy for security.If they werent around I dont know how I would have dealt with it.Hell, I was ready to pack it in and quit right then and there.I was just starting to get Harris to calm down, agreeing with him that I was professor McGonagall and the Gryffindor was, in fact, the best when the state ward, old Mr. Dimple, had stood up.As I struggled with the boy, the old bum walked over to the basin in the corner of the room, and unceremoniously dunked his head face first into the water that someone - not me  had failed to drain from it.I swear I will hear the sound his head made as it smacked into the porcelain in my nightmares for the rest of my life.When Harris saw him doing this, hed stopped struggling, shushed the girl and disengaged himself from me.Together, they headed over with me trailing behind.I was scared, I admit it.I felt sure that sure Dimple was dead.I thought at first that they would try to help the old man, but instead the boy had looked at his companion, wide eyed, and intoned in a solemn voice that Dumbledore is using the pensieve to see my memories.That was when the security guard had poked his head into the rec area, saw what was going on and he, together with two or three orderlies had pulled them away from the old man.The commotion had woken Roland, and hed joined the fray screaming something about wizards chess and protect the queen! It took another three guards to wrestle the patients back to the secure wing.Dimple is in the infirmary with fluid in his lungs.I dont think hes going to make it.You know what's really bizarre?I couldnt find the dildo afterwards.Honestly, I dont know how much longer I can do this.**The Gang.**  
Early morning sunlight filtered through the louvered window set in the ceiling of the padded cell.It played across Harrys closed eyelids, and he stirred, woke.His limbs felt rigged, constrained, and when looked down at himself he was horrified to discover that the top half of his boy was entirely ensconced in what seemed to be a cocoon of silk.He turned his head and saw Ron lying to his left, similarly secured, and below his feet, lying on her side, Hermione.He tested his bonds.His legs were free, just asleep, but he found that he could move them easily one the prickle-pain of returning circulation had passed.His arms, however-  

Tight, like a steel wire wound securely around a drum and he knew right away that there was no escaping from it using conventional means.No, this called for magic, but the way in which his arms were folded across his midriff made reaching for his wand an impossibility.Panic rose in his throat but he pushed it down.That was what Voldemort wanted, to make them scared, because a scared wizard was one who made mistakes.Harry closed his eyes, concentrated on his breathing and counted backwards from ten, forcing his fevered mind back into a state of calm.When he was able to focus, he looked around again.Ron would be no help, Harry could see that his friend was as immobile as he was, if not more so.But Hermione  It looked as if one of the strands of silk that surrounded her had come unstuck from the rest, and it was possible, maybe just possible, that she would be able to free an arm.He looked around the room again.It was not one he recognized, but somehow he felt that they were still in Hogwarts.There was a certain familiarity about it, and he thought that it might have been the Room of Requirement.Someone elses requirement, obviously, since the last thing any of them required was to be bound and held against their will.It was not very large, circular, completely white from floor to celling and empty, except for the mirror of Erised which was shoved against the far wall.There was no one else in the room and Harry felt confident that they werent being watched.It felt safe to call out, so he did.Hermione!

At first there was no response, but then she stirred, and a moan escaped her lips.He called again and this time her eyes fluttered open, and he watched as she looked around, straining against the bonds.Hermione!  

She looked at him, confused.Harry, what is this?

I dont know, I just woke up myself, but look, its going to be all right.Were getting out of this.It looks as if youll be able to get your hand out.

The girl wriggled in her cocoon.Yes, youre right. Relief lightened her features.I think I will.

Ron woke then, and after a few moments of alarmed yelling, Harry and Hermione was able to calm him down and explain the situation.Blood hell, he muttered, this stuff looks like Aragogs web.Remember Harry, when we went into Forbidden Forrest that time?The spiders kept their food wrapped up like this.

Dont be stupid, Ron, Hermione spat.Aragog is Harrys friend, why would he bind us up like this?

Bloody hell, Ron muttered again, but said no more.It took a long time, but with a great amount of wriggling and contorting Hermione was able to free her arm, and after that it was short work to free herself and then the other two.All three of them retrieved their wands from beneath their robes, Hermione struggling  bit to dislodge hers from where she had hidden it, and then they walked around the room, wands at the ready.They tried to find a breach in the walls, some way to escape, but found nothing.Finally, they lined up, shoulder to shoulder in front of the mirror.This is Voldemorts doing, Harry said, its got dark magic written all over it.What I cant figure out is how he got into Hogwarts.Dumbledores spells prevents it.

Harry Hermione began and then paused, uncertain.Both Harry and Ron looked at her, surprised.It was unlike her to be at a loss for words.The girl saw them looking, bit her lip, looked down at the floor.When she continued, her voice was scarcely above a whisper.Dumbledore is captured, Harry.I saw some Dementors making off with him after the battle.Before they brought us here.

He cant help us now.  

**The Doctor.**  
It was fascinating to watch them.Not in all his years in psychiatry had he seen such a perfectly shared hallucination.All three of them, in synch, seeing the same fantasy, immersed in it.Sure, the heroin he administered on a daily basis probably had some role to play, but he doubted that it did much more than assist them in conjuring up new adventures to complete their reality.The real science here was studying the phenomenon of three such disparate subjects seizing on the same narrative and living it out.It was the minutiae of their actions that made it so interesting, the way in which they tackled real-world problems as if it were a part of the fantasy.Like the thing with the straight-jackets.These now lay discarded in a heap in the middle of the room as the trio discussed this 'Voldemort'.It had been the doctor who had slipped one of the straps loose from the girls jacket when they had been brought it, just to see how they would incorporate this opportunity into their world.And they'd done it, seizing upon something called Aragog without hesitation as soon as the red-haired boy had mentioned it.All of them, their minds immediately in perfect agreement about what Aragog was and that he was real, even though the word had never been spoken between them before.It was, in his opinion, not far-fetched to consider the possibility of actual, real world telepathy taking place here, and if he could somehow prove itHello Nobel prize.He glanced at his watch.Hagrid.

Yes, Dr. Riddle? The bearded intern looked up from his clipboard and waited.Lets get them ready for bed.
