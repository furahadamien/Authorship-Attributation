Little did he know his last escort was fast approaching.It had been hundreds of thousands of years since he had began, but to him it all was a single instant and eternity all at once.When your dead time ceases to exist and everything and nothing happens all at once.But, the number of humans had slowed recently.It seemed there was a trickle where there had been an river before.What happened?The next soul beckoned from a distance.This soul was further away than normal.The passenger was near a planet with no human inhabitants.Normally the reaper was quiet but today he had to ask questions.He said how did you get here?.And it felt odd speaking for the first time in a literal eternity.I dont know, I had just gone EVA to fix a component on the auxiliary FTL drive when I saw a bright light then you spoke to me.... the man had realization that light, im... im dead? 

Yes, but how did you get to this planet?No humans have lived here before death pressed the question.Im dead?Like done?No tomorrow?No alpha centari?No one is going to fix the drive?The drive!What happened to the drive? The new passenger meandered

Death retorted not with words but with a vision of the events that lead to his demise.First it showed an argument between a man and a woman it appeared they were in a control room of sorts with read outs and touch screens all around.Hey thats my wife and Jim, what are they arguing about?

Then the vision showed the man hitting a button the ship lurched and slowed and  the control panels light up.One read FTL OFFLINE in blinking red light.The passenger entered the vision and the man feigned ignorance.The woman played along.The passenger started putting it together his soul sunk 

The next part of the vision was the passenger putting on his EVA suit and stepping out side, then the FTL drive light up white, then empty space and a corpse where there had once been a ship and the passenger.The passenger began get angry but quickly discovered emotion played no role in the after life the best he could muster was a disappointed sigh assholes.Death pressed again.How did you get there?

The passenger turned and said well we werent supposed to tell anyone about our mission, but since im dead...  death leaned in to listen Earth had been destroyed by humans millennia ago we were on mars building ships for interstellar travel, turns out the moon Oberon had a lot of materials we could use for building ships.We were based there.We stole this ship and were headed out into interstellar space.My shipmates, my wife,he said with disdain, and my best friend, were a part of the mission to reach humans beyond out solar system.While earth had been uninhabited for a long time, we had colonized the system.But what nobody knew is that our sun is beginning to go red giant.Everyone will die if we dont.... well if they dont reach the humans in alpha centari


Death took this all in.And realized there must be other reapers in other parts of the solar system.And that earth humans were his ward.
