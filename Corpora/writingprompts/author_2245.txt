Cycle 800080, loop 4:32.I don't know what it means.I don't even know how I know it.I'm so confused.Where am I?Who am I?Wait, where's my body?Is this a dream?It must be.I wake up, god knows where, without a body and I'm not freaking out.It must be a dream, yet it feels oddly real.Why can't I remember who I am?Why am I not freaking out?Why am I not freaking out about not freaking out?*- We know you must have a lot of questions.You can call us Yoda.*

Wait, who said that?Behind me.How did I turn?It's like I didn't move, but I felt a shift and now I'm looking at another part of this weird room.It looks like something out of a video game set in a far, far future.And there's Yoda.Cool, it's not some weird, distorted dream Yoda, it really looks like Yoda.But he doesn't talk like Yoda.*- We apologize.The exact syntax of this particular character is unfamiliar to us.We have done our best to create a familiar environment conductive to the process of reconstruction.*

Weird.It's like he can hear my thoughts.Never had that dream before.*- We can, in a manner of speaking.This is not a dream.We do not fully understand how real it is from your perspective, since reality is subjective.For us, this is very real.*

This must be how Alice felt when she fell down the rabbit hole.How do you pinch yourself to check if you're dreaming if you don't have anything to pinch?And nothing to pinch with?Wait, what was that trick with the clock?If you want to know if you're dreaming, look at a clock.Something about time passing differently in dreams.What time is it?\- *From your perspective, it is 13.8 billion years after your death.If Earth still existed, your local time would be 11:32 pm on a Wednesday in August,*

What the hell did I smoke before I went to bed?It's surreal, and real at the same time.Wait, can something really be real and surreal at the same time?*- We are sorry that the experience is disorienting.This is our first encounter with a human mind.We have already learned so much, and we hope to learn more.But we do not have much time.Even at our technological level, the noetic field stabilizer has limits on how long it can run.We do not know exactly how long we have before you disspiate.*

Die, you mean?Again?Can you die in a dream?Wait, what if this isn't a dream?What if I am dead?No, you can't think when you're dead.And if I died, what did I die of?*- We do not know.We learn from your memories.What you cannot remember, we cannot learn.We want you to remember, but our technology is not without flaws.We are happy we recovered as much of your mind as we have.*

Well, this is bleak.Thank you, brain.I'm dead and memoryless in a dream, and I can't even pinch my way out of it.What could this be if it isn't a dream?*- To put this in concepts you understand: you are a forensic reenactment of a human mind that from our horizon existed 13.8 billion years ago.You are also the first human mind we encounter.It is quite the honor, as you are the earliest proto-intelligent species we have discovered.We do not have much time, and we want you to remember.We want to learn.You need to find a path to the memories.We believe the beginning of each path is a question.Ask us anything.*

I'm starting to believe this is not a dream.Rationality dictates it must be, but it feels more real by the second.*- That is most likely the result of us tuning the noetic field stabilizer.We assure you, this is very real.We want to know what the first proto-intelligent species were like.Curiosity is an integral part of intelligence.So please, ask us anything.If we know the answer, and can relay it, we will do so.*

Great.I have a dream where I can ask future aliens anything, and I can't come up with one single question.What would you ask, if you were me?\--------------------------

\[This is an actual invitation to you as a reader to ask a question you'd ask in this situation.I need to go to bed, as it's 2:45 in the morning here, but if I get any questions, I'll continue the story tomorrow.\]
