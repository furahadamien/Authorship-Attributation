**RON**

The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with stars, and below it the four long House tables were lined with disheveled students, some in traveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns.Here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts.Every eye, living and dead, was fixed upon Professor McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall.Behind her stood the remaining teaches, including Firenze, and the members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight."The evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madame Pomfrey.Prefects, when I give the word, you will organize your House and take your charges in orderly fashion to the evacuation point."*Bloody hell,* Ron thought, *she better not mean for us and Harry to be evacuated too*.Surely not - well, surely not Harry, the rules never seemed to apply to him - but you could never tell with teachers.After all his work over the past year, there was no way he was going to just *leave* with a bunch of first years.From the way Hermione's hand tightened against his, he thought she might be having similar thoughts.He glanced around the room, trying to find Harry.Maybe they could slip out unnoticed?Suddenly Ernie Macmillian stood up at the Hufflepuff table.He looked fat and beligerent, Ron thought."And what if we want to stay and fight?"Heads nodded among the other students, even the first- and second-years.McGonagall gazed primly across at him."If you are of age," she said, "you may stay."At this, some of the student broke out into grins and began to applaud, but Hermione looked grim.For a fleeting instant, Ron thought she looked, well...*old*.Forty at least.Was that a flicker of sorrow that passed over her face?If so, he thought he knew why she might feel that way."They should go," he whispered to her."This isn't a game that's coming.The Death Eaters will be trying to kill them, not take points away from their Houses.""I know," she said forlornly."But would you or I have listened, at their age?"Harry slid up through the crowd, looking determined."Guys, we need to go, *now*.My scar is on fir--"

Finally!The fools had gathered in the Great Hall!He had been waiting for this.With a look of grim satisfaction, he yelled *rudis potentia* and thrust his wand towards the building.There was an great *rush* of raw energy and a blinding flash of pure white light as he cast the spell, then Hogwarts erupted in a huge ball of red fire like those he had seen on the Muggle viewing devices.A moment later, an enormous shockwave thumped against the shield he had created around the Death Eaters, scouring buildings from the land and obliterating trees for as far as the eye could see.As his eyes recovered from the yellow and purple after images left by the explosion, he knew that he had finally won.It pained him to destroy Hogwarts after all it had done for him, but sacrifices had to be made.He allowed himself a brief moment of triumph when he felt Potter die.Finally.
