Jesus fuck eight months.Eight months in this tin.Years of training.A lifetime of dreams, and eight months in this tin, and in the next 30 minutes it will all be worth it.We'll finally reach our destination.Finally see first hand how red this planet really is.I can't explain how im feeling.I feel light, I feel almost careless, but at the same time uneasy.I don't know.My arms are numb.Like i'm not getting enough blood.I flex, everythings working, I just feel off.10 minutes, and I'm down there.10 minutes, and my team and I have achieved more than practically any human in existence.10 minutes and i'm first.10 minutes and i'm infamous.My god the journey.The pain the saddness the love.I don't need to do much for the landing.It's mostly in Alex's hands.I watch myself make a fist.It's time we land on this frigid, irresolute, and magnificent planet.Jesus fuck.46 hours and I don't feel like stopping.I don't know what it is.It could be that as a 170 pound man, I weigh 68 pounds on this planet.It could be that my fucking heart hasn't slowed down since we made that rocky landing.Whatever it is, We are fucking cruising.So far there has been nothing of interest.We picked up a few rocks, checked the dirt, but haven't run into any big headed green fucks with ray guns.Haven't seen any jacked blue dudes floating around in an glass palace.Just sands and rock, and to be honest, I wouldn't have it any other way.We received new coordinates.Going to see if we can find any stage of water.Where there is water, there is life.If we could find just one microbe, we'd be accredited with the biggest discovery, perhaps in human history.Jesus I can't believe we made it this far.We cruise over a cliff, closing in on the coordinates.up above I see a shimmer.No fucking way.We arrive.The shimmer is ICE!Jesus fuck!How long has this been here?This is, this is.This is God.While others look for the slightest chance of life, I decide to see how far this bad boy goes.My god this is beautiful.For being so narrow the ice goes farther than I thought.From where we started it looks like it runs up hill.I reach it's end, and something catches my eye in the distance.Red like the planet, but motionless.What the fuck is that doing here?I get closer to make sure, because there is no way.THERE IS NO WAY.finally my nightmare is realized.I can make out the sickle and the hammer.How?When?We were supposed to be first.We were supposed to be the best, if they beat us, why the fuck didn't they say something?I get close enough to touch the flag.it's cut up.Why on earth wouldn't they tell the world.They won.They beat us...I turn around to head back to my group.I don't feel so light anymore.I talk over the conjoined mics."Guys.""Will, Get the fuck out of there!"Alex shouts.What?I see my team start to run away from me.What did they... All the sudden a shadow encompasses my walking path.I watch the rest of my team sprint down hill.The shadow goes wider and wider.Jesus fuck.
