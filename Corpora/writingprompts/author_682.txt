It is surprisingly hard to kill a great amount of relatives, friends and acquaintances without inevitably ending up as a person of interest.Somehow, being the only common denominator doesn't fare in your favour when the people you unite all manage to die by being stabbed with, according to the newspaper, a museum artefact.I wonder how the DI would react to my explanation if I would end up being caught.'Yes Sir, this dagger transports people from one reality to the other because, like, earth is fucked?Oh an insanity plea?I'll take it thanks.'Don't accept daggers from old, crazy-seeming ladies, that's the life lesson I'm taking away here.When an old woman approaches you and asks you to support saving humanity, you expect to gift 50p to Greenpeace and make an offhand comment on global warming.Not a mystical dagger that serves as some kind of portal.Why the fuck did it have to be a dagger anyway?Nuclear bombs, now there's efficiency.Guns, when talking a bit simpler.I would prefer a gun over this stupid thing anyway.It's also stupidly heavy.Like really fucking heavy, making it impossible to finger for loose coins in a pocket when there's an unwieldy, glowing, probably cursed dagger taking up too much unallocated space."Let me help you out," a voice interrupts my stream of thoughts, and I turn away from the too-bright Railcard machine screen.I smirk, briefly, not without shame.He probably thinks I'm lost.Or a tourist.Or, well, ... poor."I'm not poor you know," I tell him, but it comes out a bit too fast.I make a mental note about needing to work on people skills; what with saving humanity and all.He's got a real nice smile, but I barely have time to fully register it before he hands me a ticket."Here, should bring you to the central station.There's probably an ATM there."I like his voice."With you being so not poor and all.""Oh look, a comedian."I retort, shoving the card into my dagger-free pocket."I prefer Good Samaritan in this case.People like me are too good for this planet."A huff escapes me, but, briefly, the idea of killing him pops into my head.Because filling up alternative earth with people I don't know and only find faintly attractive sounds... terrific?Reminding myself I need to lay low for a while, I flash a cool smile and turn around, making my way to the escalator down.The wind of an arriving subway ruffles through my hair, and apparently it's loud enough to cover up the telltale thump of footsteps."You know," his voice sounds from behind me, "you could at least thank me.""And you're following me n-" 

"Least you could do is stab me with the fancy glowing knife."Oh great.I'm going to have to kill him.Jesus didn't have to go through this.Not able to decide whether to go for incredulous or offended, I find middle ground in a meaningless mumble."How do I know?Well-," 

There was no need for him to finish that sentence.The glow emanating from his jacket's inner pocket as he opens it tells me all I need to know.A part of me is furious when he tells me it's a gun.
