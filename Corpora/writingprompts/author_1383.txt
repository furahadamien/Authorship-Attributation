"Be careful," my mother told me as I left her house.In the recent years, she preferred my company at dinner a few nights a month and the cool summer nights felt great from the back of my motorcycle.I pulled out onto the main road that connected the nearby communities and drove away.On my commute, I was going through an intersection when I noticed a man sitting on a bench.There was nothing truly special about him, nothing memorable.Except this one thing.I could see the panic in his face.Illuminated by the semi truck that sent me off my cycle, sliding nearly to the man, still on the bench.Whoa.Wait.What?That wasn't a semi.That was Voshrein's fist that sent my body flying several meters.Voshrein?Oh, that's the boyfriend of the girl I've been hitting on at this shitty 3rd rate skooma bar of the rings of Saturn."How was your trip?"echoed from within the bar, mocking my failure.
