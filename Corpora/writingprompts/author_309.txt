"Good morning," I said, passing her the morning newspaper.It was the first day of June.The curve of her smile on that day wasn't just sunlight and air and nostalgia, the stuff of sleepless nights and countless days, but physical.It had been a while since I had seen the smile meet her eyes.Nude lipstick, stiff jacket, beige tights.Recently, because of arthritis, she had stopped wearing her bun, which had been her hallmark of the past few decades.Instead, she wore her white hair loose.I liked it better that way.Her nails were painted and manicured.She was running the bath upstairs, and as she passed me to go into the hallway, she rested her soft moisturised hand on my shoulder for only a moment longer than usual to gather her breath.As I boiled the kettle, I heard her slowly shuffling up the flight of steps.I didnt need to relive this moment to remember every detail.Blue skies were too bright.The trees and the walls held their breath.The sun was dancing through the patio windows, heat on glass, and as I watched them, the spidery cosmetic cracks on their surface, I wondered what it would take for all the tiny cracks and scratches to join and deepen and, all at once, for one sudden explosion to give way.Maybe, in her own way, she knew.Another long day of silence.Getting up, washing the car, visiting family, playing out Sunday lunch with daughters and grandchildren the same way as every Sunday, like a musical box.Ironed shirts, pressed smiles.It happened to be the date of our 50th wedding anniversary, but no one asked the secret to a long marriage.Im not sure what I would have said if someone had asked.Coming home, switching on the television.Brushing teeth, back to sleep.Sleep was shorter these days, but the days were faster than ever."This is going to kill me," she said finally.I held the letter in my hand, the claim of demands marked in capitals.Their solicitors address headed the top.If I held it loosely enough, the morning breeze would gently blow it away and it would just be another a bad dream.I didnt lie to you, I said, but I had.Just not recently.A single promise, over half a century ago, had quelled all suspicions and ironed out old mistakes.Since then, I didnt need to lie, because I could forget it had ever happened.And I had forgotten.It had worked.Almost.Who is this? she said.There was a letter in her hands.I didnt recognise the handwriting, or the recipient, but as I read it I recalled the characters and the plot and the setting, like a novel I had read a long time ago.An ultimatum from a woman I had never met; a mother I wish I had never met.I looked up and her eyes met mine, and they were not smiling.Well be back soon, I said.I walked our granddaughter to the car, bobbed hair over young shoulders.We waved behind us, and she waved back.As tiny eyes looked up to me, she suddenly smiled.I almost flinched in amazement, because I had seen it before.Their smiles were the same.Tickling her under the chin, I started the ignition.I had done well in life.I had worked hard.It was the first day of my retirement, and there was much more still left to live for.If we have enough change, remember to buy a paper, she said.She looked tired.I closed the door and walked to the bank to secure the loan.My second daughter walked by my side and I held her hand.My mind was busy.Friends to see, places to be.And always my family to come home to, my wife cooking the dinner and keeping the house clean, my two beautiful daughters.I was lucky.I wont leave again, I said.My voice was muffled against her shoulder, my arms linked around her figure that felt far smaller than I remembered.I saw a curious set of eyes peeking around a door frame, almost hidden by a web of blonde curls and stubby fingers.It had been three years.My hands were more weathered, my skin sea-torn and tight, but I was a man now.And a father.You have to go, she said, but we both knew it wasnt strictly true.I had faked my age so that I could get onto the ship.I reached out and held her soft hands at the front door.Her eyes were sad and her mouth controlled.I reminded her I wanted to serve my country.I reminded myself I wanted the adventure.She let my hands go.Her cotton dress, immaculate as ever, was pressed tightly against the round of her belly."There's no other.There has never been another," I said, and I slipped the engagement ring onto her finger, and held her close to me.The fairground was singing, the road was clattering, the night was alive with stars, and I had never heard it all so clearly.I promised myself that there would be no more mistakes, no more lies."Good morning, she said, shyly.She jumped down from the wall, her uniform neat and starched around her long legs.Her hair was loose around her shoulders, longer than the fashionable bob of the day.It was only our third date, but as I looked at her and took in everything - her bitten nails, her laddered tights, the curve of her smile - it made me decide there and then.With this woman, with her smile, was the beginning and the end.It was only the second time in my life I had felt this way.
