I sat in bewilderment.One moment I was in my friends car and now I'm drinking "tea" and the worst part?I'm in a fucking tuxedo.Yes you read that right.This fucking girl has me wearing a fucking tuxedo.Why am I making a bid deal of a tux?When was the last time YOU saw a fucking tux?Shut up.I hate things touching my neck.Back to the point.This must be hell.im not good with kids.Last kids I spoke to were my cousins.And... wait...I'm dead?Shit... shit shit shit.That dickhead crashed.I told him he wasnt sober enough to drive.Anyway why do i keep being side tracked?THE FUCK DOES THIS KID WANT?After a few days of me being a dick I realise why I'm stuck here.Poor girl is being bullied.I've been there.Do I teach her to fight?Do I protect her?One day before school i see her take a knife from the knife stand."No Saph, dont do this.Dont hurt them just scare them okay?"What happened next chilled me to my non-existent bones.She looked at me dead kn the eyes and said "dont tell me what to do".I couldnt stop her.I'm not a poltergeist.She did exactly what you expected her to do.She was taken into a psych ward.They kept forcing these little pink pills down her throat and I could feel my body getting colder."NO!"I screamed into the void "DONT KILL ME!I CAN FIX HER!I CAN SAVE HER".They did it.Day after day after day after day... it's dark.I dont like being alone... can anyone hear me?Please Tell Sapphire I'm sorry I wasnt good enough.Please
