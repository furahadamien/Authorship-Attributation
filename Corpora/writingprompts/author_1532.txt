Tonight, I would escape or perish in the attempt.Ice crystals whipped at my cheeks and the wind tugged at my beard.Two hundred years without a shave leaves a man bedraggled to say the least.Imprisonment for 364 days out of the year, with little to no exercise, leaves him in rounder shape.But two hundred years of captivity has hardened my resolve and weathered what frugal glimpses of hope allotted to me.Tonight was the night.Christmas Eve.I patted Prancer on the flank, and passed my hand over Dancer's nose, rubbing the base of his antlers, in the way I knew he'd like.They were prisoners too, like me.The gentlefolk were tasking masters, and the harsh conditions of our imprisonment had built a kinship between me and the reindeer that was hard to explain.Sometimes, it was almost as if I could *hear* their thoughts.And sometimes, it was as if they could understand my words.The sleigh had already been loaded.The time enchantments had been activated.Now was time for the journey.At least, that's what the gentlefolk expected."Ready, Rudolph?"I called, my voice rasping on the wind.I had no one to talk to when I was cooped up in the basement of the workshop.It was a relief just to speak at all.The reindeer at the front of the line, turned back, bells jingling on his harness.As always, a bit had been placed in his mouth; and as always, I reached up to remove it.*Thank you.*

I stared.Rudolph stared back.Had I just heard...But no.The insanity was setting in again.My mind had broken before--the never-ending cycle of squeezing down chimneys, lugging hefty packages year after year, imprisoned in the time loop until I'd delivered the very last package.I was a glorified delivery man.Some of the packages, I knew, were the *real* reason for my flight.Some of those packages were delivered to other gentlefolk hidden around the world.But the pretense was neccessary for my captors, so none of the ambassadors, who kept an eye on things in this world, would catch wind of their schemes.*I said,* Rudolph sniffed, shaking his antlers.*Thank you.*

This time, I stared and didn't look away."Are you--are you talking to me?"*Yes.*

"You can understand me?"*Obviously.*

"I--I--" A sob escaped my lips and reached over and hugged Rudolph, holding him tight.A harsh voice called from one of the lookout towers at my back, and I quickly released the reindeer.I made my way to the front of the carriage and clambered into the sleigh, groaning with the effort.Quietly, though, as I made my preparations for flight, I murmured."I'm escaping tonight.Who wants to join me?"Rudolph flicked his tail.Prancer shook his horns.Every one of the reindeer gave some sort of silent acknowledgement.*What's the plan?* came a breathy, excited voice.Blitzen's.She was always the most energetic of the bunch, and often tired the slowest."The time loop," I said, keeping my voice low as I shorted the reins and leaned back in the chair."I tinkered with it when bossman wasn't looking.They've grown complacent.When the time loop frays, just before midnight on Christmas Eve, there will be a gap.We'll need to be over Greenland to break through.But if we do, we'll escape."*And if not?*

"If not, we'll be trapped forever."I gave the command and the reindeer charged forward.Moments later, we took to the sky in a flurry of swirling ice and frost.Up, up, up, we scythed through the night sky; the dreams and wishes of children all around the world in the back of my sleigh.The dreams and wishes of the sleigh riders, somewhere in the near future.***
