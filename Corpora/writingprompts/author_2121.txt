I mumbled a sound somewhere between a word and a scream.Clamping my hand over my mouth, I turn to the work bathroom mirror and see my face.Good.Something I know.My eyes slide to the left and there she is, her eyes piercing blue like they were staring right into my soul.Well, not "like", that's what they were literally doing.Our eyes met in the reflection and suddenly I realised.She's heard every thought I've ever had.She knows every insecurity, every secret, every embarrassing moment.Oh God, I bet she also knows abou-

"Stop" she says firmly, while raising a hand to quiet me "You're overthinking, I hate it when you do that."Right."So, have you been following me around all this time?"I ask."No, I've just been the thoughts in your head.But now....." she was looking at her hand like it was a prized jewel on display.She tore her eyes away and let them prod me again "Now I'm real!"Her mouth contorted into a wide smile, then opening into an insane bark of a laugh.Footsteps.Crap.This wasnt a great time for my psychotic thoughts to manifest in my head.Her laughing had died down and she wiped a happy tear from her eye, then tried to steady her rapid breathing.I stepped towards her."Half an hour."I said in the most assertive voice I could muster."Half an hour and my shift will be over and I can figure out how to deal with this.But until then, you stay here and you don"t disturb anyone.Clear?""Crystal."She said with a smile tugging at the edges of her lips.I sighed and walked over to the door.I cast one more look over my shoulder before turning the handle on the door and stepping out.Idiot.That's what she was.An idiot.I'm finally free of being mere thoughts and she wants me to stay here?Ha!Not a chance!I let the black shadows seep back into my head and eyes and I smile."Time to have some fun!"I announce to the empty room before turning the door handle, and walking out.God, freedom is fun.(This is my first post on this thread and it was so fun!I'm on mobile)
