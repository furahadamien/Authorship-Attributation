The massive, angular craft drifted into orbit around a dead world.A world scarred by a war fought so long before what the rest of universe viewed as the dawn of time.A war in which there would be no victory.Against a foe that sought to tear the galaxy asunder and could not be defeated.Themselves.I shuddered at the thought.This world, unlike the tens of thousands like it, was the Homeworld of the species that my people had looked up to for so very long.They still existed in some way.Their descendants scattered across much of the galaxy still mourned the loss of their ancestral home.Earth.Everyone in the galaxy knew of them, and by as many names as there were stars.The Guardians, the Old Ones, the Ancients, the Hominids.Their true name was long gone and forgotten.Abandoned in their haste to distance themselves from what they once were, even as they embraced their heritage as the true inheritors of the galaxy.For what claim could be made by others against the Descendents of those who lived, conquered and ruled so many aeons before our most distant ancestors had even climbed from the primordial soup?Of course they were challenged, time and time again.But even fractured into a thousand Star Nations they were indomitable.Undeafetable.This expedition was only even possible with assistance from them, as any attempt to "defile" their ancestral home was met with a fury the likes of which had ripped apart the galaxy the last time it had been unleashed in the single-minded goal of defending that which they could never regain.And punishing those who dared to trespass where even they hesitated to go.And now that I can see the planet, I think I understand why.This is a grave.A grave for the billions reduced to ash in a civil war, and the remains forced to flee aboard primitive starships.For this happened not at their height, but long before the creation of even the fist node of the translight network.And as I look out the window, I can see green forests, blue oceans, land teeming with life.And yet, there is Something there.Something missing, like a small, clean hole in a masterful painting.An inky void that, while noticed, can scarcely even be described.This was a dead world because even overgrown with new life, you could hear the echoes of what once was.Sprawling cities of glass and metal reaching towards the sky, roads and rails connecting disparate groups across thousands of miles.The scars, not of war but of civilization itself were what haunted this place.I looked around the bridge, and I think the others saw it too.
