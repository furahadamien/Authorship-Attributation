Dan knew there was a possibility he had some sort of psychological disorder, but he figured he'd been at it long enough he may as well continue.In for a penny?In for a pound.Mathematically it didn't make sense to Dan, and he pondered this while donning his navy fleece jacket.The smallest the number of humans there have been on the planet was somewhere under one hundred thousand.While Dann was prolific, there was no way he could even get a fraction of a fraction of that number.Hell, the genetic diversity of homosapien-sapiens was already extremely hindered, a few hundred humans would soon be more inbred than British royalty and hillbillies.He continued briskly down the sidewalk.It was a cold evening, and Daniel had a some time to go.He had actually been summoned to this one, and that hadn't happened since the very beginning.This is one of the reasons he rationalizes away the idea of an acute psychosis; there are physical places he knows he needs to go.And he's almost always right.And then what about animals?Plants?Birds?Bacteria?How hard is it going to be to rebuild the world with nothing?No tools and n--Dan stopped in his tracks, as a thought hit him.It was such a slap to the face he even said it aloud."I should have been killing construction workers and plumbers.Not just scientists and engineers.Fuck."Sure, there were Some blue collar workers.This wasn't so much about selection so much as testing.Drunk found stabbed to death in a truck behind a hole in the wall?Not exactly national news.dan tried to be as ethnically diverse as possible.Even though he doubted there would be enough people, he may as well try to shake things up genetically.As he strode to the locked door, he unzipped his gray jacket to extract a key from an inside pocket.Bronze key in hand, he inserted it into the knob.With the deadbolt unlocked, Dann swung open the door.Daniel stepped through threshold.In that instant, the world turned to white and empty and then totally full of-WHAT THE FUCK.Dan looked out to seemingly infinite versions of him.No.There were some variations.dan froze as a voice boomed through his head.Their heads.Our heads.It was his own voice.Maybe.You never sound the same as the voice in your head because recorders don't pickup bone conduction."Okay, I knew this shit would be a problem.Get this through your heads--there's more than one of you working.We're not stupid.We thought of that and now you  know.So stop over-thinking this shit and get back to work because we're on a limited time scale!"Then it was gone.Back to reality.Dean stepped outside, locking the door behind him with his steel key.
