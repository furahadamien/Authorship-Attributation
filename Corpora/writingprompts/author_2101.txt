*Turn around...*

No...no I can't.*Turn around.*

Please, I can't.Ever since you haunted me, all those years ago, I was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia.I barely survived a suicide attempt, then my wife left me for another man, and I lost the ability to feel...anything.People at work treat me like I'm never there, and-

*Turn around*.Slowly, ever so slowly, I turn around, and there she was, staring me in the eyes.Those cool, blue eyes that stared into my soul, and I...I couldn't look away.God damn it, but I couldn't look away...

*Take my hand...*

I could feel something, for the first time in a long time, I felt something more than fear and sadness.I felt hope.I raised my hand, and reached out, taking hers.*It's all right.She forgave you a long time ago.*

I could feel that pain welling inside, that pain from so long ago, before everything went so numb.I stared into her blue eyes, those twin pools that took it all in, and offered peace.*Now it's time to forgive yourself.*

I could feel it start to come back, that pain, and part of me wanted to pull away.Part of me wanted to run away as far as I could, but those eyes...those eyes were showing me that there was more to the world than pain and suffering...and....I wanted it.I needed it.*It's time.*

I felt something go loose, like the way it feels when you hold in a breath you don't even realize you're holding, and then I felt my hand slipping through hers, as a white light appeared.*Go ahead, be at peace.*

I knew I should be scared, I knew that part of me wanted to run and never look back.But when I looked into her eyes, I knew that I would be okay.It was time, and for the first time in a long time...I felt hope.
