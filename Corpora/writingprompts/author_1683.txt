"There it is!", I exclaimed blowing dust from grandma's old cookbook which sent me straight into another coughing fit.I was about five minutes away from giving up the search.I had promised old granny to keep her most prized possession, but I didn't see the point in keeping it on my bedside table.My interest in that particularly strange heirloom had spiked though when the medication from the doctor didn't work after seven days.I could still hear her as if it were yesterday: "If you ever get sick, this contains the best chicken soup ever made to treat a cold!"So why not a give it a shot?I admit I was slightly confused about the instructions for that particular recipe.Why would it be important to add finely chopped garlic and ground pepper?Why cut the spring onions from left to right?Why a chicken that was alive the previous day?(I have to admit that living in a farming neighborhood came in handy for things like this.)So here I was stirring the pot counter-clockwise when suddenly smoke started developing from the bottom of the pot.I had just turned off the heat so what the hell was going on?I instinctively grabbed the cookbook to look for clues in the recipe of what I might have done wrong.As I started backing away, the pot started glowing before vanishing in the huge amounts of smoke.I was frantically thinking about what to do when the pot exploded violently demolishing half of the kitchen, being replaced what could only be called a demon!"How?How were you able to summon me?!"I was standing in the corner flipping through the cookbook for clues.Did I miss anything?!?"I don't know!!You were supposed to be chicken soup!I just wanted something to treat my cold!""Oh that at least explains why...I'm Aspirinius, the demon of pain.If you will let me go I can clear that throat ache away in no time..."
