Shalestra
I walked past the guards and into the laboratory without being challenged.Only one of the scientists looked up as I walked in, and she almost instantly looked back down at her microscope.I made my way around the room, without question or comment.I took out a bottle and sprayed a solution on the glass to the BSL-4 biohazard room.The chemical would slowly eat away the glass, a tiny leak that wouldn't register on the pressure detectors for at least a day or two, but by tonight everyone in this lab would be going home with a nice little dose of the viruses they stored in there.By next week the viruses would have spread countrywide, and by the end of the month they'd be international.Nobody said a word to me.Nobody challenged me.Nobody even really saw me, and later when the investigators came nobody would remember me.My super power?Nothing.I am "The Janitor".I clean up the mess that is humanity.Nobody will remember me, and I don't care.I have a manifesto, but nobody has read it.I have a creed, but no-one has heard it.I have a code, but nobody knows it but me.I'm not doing this for the fame.I just want to clean up the world.
