"Crickey, 'ere's a live one!"Steve exclaimed, as piercing light crept around the outside of his shades.Feathers littered the sky and orchestral choirs thunderclapped the heavensphere.All of it."This seraphim has been proclaiming the glory of God for 49,000 years, not seven but seven times seven thousand!"Steve knew the show was getting old, and the results were always the same.Every creature in heaven only proclaimed God ever, and after several million years his passion for them waned.Rathariel, a cherubim camera-angel, turned his eagle-face to Steve."Isn't it time we put our eye on something new?""How do I get out of heaven?"Steve wondered.He thought of the biblical stories taught to him as a child."This God stuff is older than a croc!"Steve's body and soul burned with the pain the Lord felt from his blasphemies.God's light was no longer there, and only Rathariel shined in the eternal darkness.Big R no longer needed his darkened camera lens.Life in Austrialia meant Steve had no problem with the heat either.He found his new home.
