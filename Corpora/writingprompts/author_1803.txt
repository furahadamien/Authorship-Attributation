I watch as my owner smiles and climbs into the metal box that moves.I run up to the door, making sure he is secured to his seat.He smiles and pats me on the head, "This won't take long bud".I am guided to the metal box behind his and get in.I hear the strange devices that power these machines spin up.With a jerk, we begin to move.I see other large metal boxes behind us, some with the really loud machines mounted on top.I'm new to this group of humans though, I have never seen the loud machines used.What feels like hours pass.How do the humans not feel the time slipping by so quickly?They seem to live much longer than us canines, how lucky they are to have so much time here.Before I contemplate this further however, I hear a terrifying boom, sounding like a thousand lightning bolts had impacted the ground at the same time.My ears shrieked, but I could still hear my humans screaming.Some scrambled out, taking their loud machines with them.I climbed up the seat to see what was going on.In front of me I saw the metal box in front of us, the one my owner was in, it was in flames.I heard snapping, shouting, loud noises all around me.I was terrified, I jumped below the seat and tried to shield my ears.I closed my eyes.That worked for awhile, but then I smelt something, my owner!He was still in the metal box  in front of us!I could smell burnt flesh, blood, I could hear his screams.I jumped out of my box.I could see humans everywhere, so many of them looked scared, hurt, but I had to get to my owner.I ran to the metal box.Humans were already there, dragging others out.I shouted, even though they cannot understand me I shouted, I needed to see him.Please...please...please...

Then, I saw him, he was screaming, his hands reaching for things that were not there.I ran up to him, put my paw onto his body.All of the sounds around me seemed to go away at this moment.His wild hands finally found purchase with my fur.His screaming stopped, his eyes met mine, he smiled through his charred, bloodied face, "I can't stay around much longer, boy" he said" "dont cry though, just know that wherever the fuck Im going, Ill always love you, youre my good boy, you hear me?.Even though he told me not to, I could feel tears welling up in my eyes as his smile faded and his arms went slack.I could feel the shouts of his friends desperately trying to get someone to help him.I knew though, I just pressed my paw into his chest, laid my head onto his body, and cried.
