Adam sipped out of his favourite mug during his lunch break.His hands shook as he brought the hot beverage to his lips.Grease from his hands made its way onto the surface of the cup, tainting its perfect yellow surface.His back ached in the same spot that it had for years.It had never quite felt right.He remembered the years back, when it hadn't bothered him so much.When he would come home and could hoist little Jennifer up and carry her around the house while he made supper.The divorce had been hard on him.He hadn't fought it.His first thought had been for her.For Jennifer.He gave up his house, that he had paid off both mortgages for.One when he bought it, and the other when he had to refinance, after losing his job.Tough times call for tough decisions.His old pickup had been sold during the court proceedings.He still remembered when his dad had given him the keys after they spent 4 summers restoring it.He had just graduated high school.He glanced up at the clock.A little habit of his.It wasn't necessary.He always looked up at the same time.3:15 am.15 minutes left on lunch.When he took the job at the factory, he knew the hours would be long.The shifts were poor, and the conditions were less than ideal on a good day.He silently wondered how Jennifers day would go.She was in her last year of high school.Soon she would be going to college.He wondered where she would go.There was no doubt that she would get accepted wherever she applied in Adam's mind.She was always good at school.The last time he had been able to see her was years ago.That had slipped by him in the court proceedings.As the last of the coffee went down his throat, he pulled the phone from his right pocket.Its screen was cracked and it had clear tape holding the back of it together.Silently, his fingers navigated to the banking app he kept on his home screen.Accounts.Chequing.Balance.$243.67.He saw the support payment.-$1800, had been taken already this month.Transfer.Chequing --> College fund.-$100.New Balance.$16,567.73

He closed his phone and put his mug back into his locker.The words #1 dad reflected back at him.Her last gift.He walked slowly onto the work floor.
