"You want to know why I do this?"He sighed and leaned back."Ya know no one actually has to, right?Like there wasn't originally a human psychopomp."There was the clack of a piece on the board as Zora made her play.Sweat beaded on her brow.She was glad the small talk got his eyes off her.She was a damn Go CHAMPION, but she hadn't counted on how playing for her life against the grim reaper was going.She couldn't see his eyes, or anything about him, really.She KNEW he was male, tho.Just like she could FEEL when his gaze was on her and when it wasn't."Really?What was there?"she asked.She needed to keep his mind ... wherever it was.Just not in the game."I don't really know how to describe it.I was a bit ... distracted.I had just died.Not only that, but my brother had killed me."There was a dull thud as the Reaper placed his piece."What?"Zora asked, shaking herself to look at the board.This sounded familiar to her."Then there was this ... it was simultaneously a pillar of fire and a GIANT human like thing with 8 black wings and ... oh, yeah, I love Cain.He's my brother, but emotional control was never his strong suit.That's why I became the sheep herd, y'know?He was too sensitive to both raise and slaughter them.He got so attached."It's your play, Zora," The Reaper reminded her gently.Zora started again.She'd gotten lost staring into the shadows of his robe.The more he spoke, the less he looked like a grinning skull, and the more it seemed the visage of a person was concealed in the shadows of the robe."Wait, you're ABEL!?Like Cain and Abel from the BIBLE!?"She exclaimed."Just the one," He said kindly, "And it's still your play, Zora.""Yeah, you right."Zora took a deep breath as she studied the board.She started to see a pattern.She thought for a minute and placed a piece with a gentle clack."You said he IS your brother?Not was??"She asked as Abel reached for his piece."You're correct.He's still alive.Cursed to wander the Earth til its end.I was angry at him, at first.I first stayed to watch his suffering.To enjoy his punishment.But then the next person died.And I saw that impassive giant appear again, and I knew I couldn't let another soul deal with that.After a while, though, I started to realize how much he was hurting.How terrible his punishment is.And how much I miss him.Now I'm glad to do this kindness to the many, many strange souls passing in the world today, while I wait to be reunited with my big brother.We'll leave this world together when it is done."There was another thud as he placed his piece.A clack as Zora placed hers."That's a LOT," She said, "I don't know if I could do that for my brother, and he didn't even kill me.""It took me a LONG time to feel as I do, Zora," Abel said softly."A lot of seeing how cruel humans would get to one another.A lot of seeing my brother build himself up only to topple himself later."Zora's heart was beating in her chest as she tried to keep her attention on the board.There was a thud as Abel placed his piece."YES!"Zora exclaimed as she placed her piece - cascading the board as she circled his position.She'd won!She'd beaten the Grim Reaper to keep her life!"Good play, Zora!I haven't lost at this game in a century!"Abel laughed as he started to clear the board."Do you want to play again?""What?NO!I want to go back to my life!"Zora shouted as she stood up quickly."I want to go back to school tomorrow and prep for my next tournament!""Oh," Abel said softly, sadly."It doesn't work that way.I don't control who lives or dies.I just guide you on your way when you're ready.I'm happy to play until you're ready to go, though.You know I'm not in any hurry now."

It was their signals we found first.Mystifying radio waves bouncing across the universe like a strange temper tantrum.Our scientists fiercely debated whether they were a strange calculation code, or encoded visual data.One fool even postulated a translation of purely vibrational data.Who could imagine a species that would discover the electromagnetic frequency & use yo encode specific vibrations of atmosphere?Every other species that we encountered mentioned receiving similar & often the same signals.Our mutual curiousity became a bonding point for a budding interstellar alliance.As we cross referenced we were able to trace the information back to a single planet.Imagine a species so desperate to find siblinghood that it screamed out across the galaxies to find another species   to speak with.We followed their flashes across the vast blackness to a tiny arm of a spiral galaxy to a tiny yellow dwarf on the verge of going red giant.We've been able to pull the planet out of its orbit, stable for some several billion years.We've seen an interesting blend of organic and inorganic structures under the layers of cataclysm.Signs of a massive impact that seems dated to match the 3rd moon seem to indicate the 7th or 8th mass extinction on the planet.Thankfully it was a unique carbon based life process on this planet, prone to petrification that has preserved many signs of the life past, despite the massive oceans of caustic salt water.I am curious to see what we'll learn of the mysterious flashers & what inspired them to blast these wide beams of electromagnetic energy all throughout the universe.
