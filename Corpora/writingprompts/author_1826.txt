I'm wagging my tail slowly.Hopefully my master understands.I am happy, cautiously.I put my head down next to your thigh.And fart.I feel much better now.Now my master will know I ate all the food he left me, even the treasure at the bottom of the trash.I wag my tail more enthusiasticly.Want to play ball?
