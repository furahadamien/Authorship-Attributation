Our first official contact with them was the day they descended like wasps onto every major metropolitan area and began sucking motherfuckers right off the street.I'm talking people being vacuumed straight up outta their loafers.at first it was a funny sight, but then the drones came down and scoured the entire earth.They processed all but the finest specimen.I was among them , thank Xenu.There were about 1 million of us, they quarantined us in Las Vegas, or what once was Las Vegas.It wasn't long before people started noticing strange happenings.Some claimed to have bent a spoon with their mind, others could share thoughts silently.As the days went on peoples abilities became undeniable.This caught our overseers' eyes.They immediately conducted tests and operations on us, often to fatal results.But as the specimens dwindled our powers grew.We took note of this, but did our best to keep it under wraps.Our shrinking mob had no hope, no leader, no organization, not even a common language, but perhaps these powers were our secret ace in the hole.A power shared by all mankind might be enough to do away with these tentacled bastards.I myself had been vivisected twice by this point, among countless other ordeals and probes.Needless to say I had had enough.I was also, by that time, able to lift a car with my mind.Ever so slightly, mind you, I would focus all of my will on raising a car on the street just a few millimeters of the ground.so as not to garner suspicion from the eyes in the sky.We all could feel the surge of power when one of our own succumbed to the brutal treatments those monsters put them through.Everyone could feel the power within them, but now it seemed only I was willing and able to use them.The fact that I killed them all so easily is a testament to that.None of them had the power to defend themselves, and had resigned themselves to whatever fate these hentai monster looking sons a bitches had in store for them.But I couldn't let Humanity go down like that, without a fight.I knew if I had the entirety of this power I alone could take them out.I didn't want to kill my own, but its better that it was one of us than one of them that did it.I plucked several of their ships from the sky and plunged them into into the ocean.It was an amazing sight.So satisfying.I almost came.But then he came down from upon high and explained the truth of it all to me
