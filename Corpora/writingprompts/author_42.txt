ArbitraryOpinion
I remembered seeing this back now.I thought I should stop by to 2017 on my way back to bitch-slap Karl Marx, and let you all know that it all ends up okay.All of this protesting gets us nowhere, and they do succeeded in banning net neutrality, but the free market saves us.It always does.Around mid 2018, despite all of their promises to the contrary, AT&T and Verizon began capitalising on their duopoly.For a few months the future looked truly bleak as people started going outside and getting exposed to the sun, and other people.Necks were shaved, showers were had, it was horrible.But seemingly out of nowhere - although in hindsight we really should have trusted in the wisdom of Ajit Pai - smaller ISP's started popping up all along the east coast.The cynics in us outwardly dismissed them and their dreams for a better world; Didn't they know that the corporations and their evil capitalism were too great an opponent?But secretly we all hoped they would succeed and allow us to return to our slovenly ways.And succeed they did!It wasn't immediately clear how, but over time it was revealed that many of the big content providers had been preparing for just this eventuality.By 2025 Google alone had seeded over 9000 smaller ISP's across the nation.It wasn't fast, and there were many lawsuits, but by time President Trump suffered that fatal aneurysm, we were all safely back in our hovels, bingeing on the latest forgettable rubbish, and spewing our arbitrary opinions into the void.Still, you are here now, and you can not know that this is other than a fictitious tale.But when the brutal sun is beating down on you as you scurry about in the big outdoors, and you think it's all gone to shit, try to remember: you sometimes need to go through horrible times to truly appreciate the good in the mundane.
