All my life I have been able to subconsciously translate my speech to match the original language of who I am talking to.It was quite terrifying at first.speaking Polish to my Mom when I was 2 minutes old was quite the tale.The poor Korean woman at Walmart...

Anyways, life had gone on as usual.Occasionally, I would get compliments on my knowledge of language, or cause arguments from people thinking I spoke one way or another, but no huge events had arisen.At least, until McDonalds.I went in, expecting it to be a normal day.I was craving a cheeseburger.I make my way up to the register.Its a flashy British man taking the order.Ill have one Cheeseburger, please. I say.He stops, and stares at me.I probably had just surprised him by speaking some other language, and so I waited.He smirks.Finally! He says, in a somewhat relieved tone.Ive been waiting here for 2 years, you know! 

He hopped over the counter, and grabbed me by the wrist.You and I have some business to attend to. He said, as he dragged me out of the McDonalds.I looked behind me, and saw the other customers horrified at the events that are taking place.Who the hell are you, and what do you want!? I said, angry and confused.He turned around, and looked me directly in the eye.Im the Doctor.I was sent a message by my future self to wait at this McDonalds until a man speaking Gallifreyan arrived.
