CleverInnuendo
Another shudder roared through the structure above, followed by the whistling sound of the shells catching up with their faster physical counterparts.Each volley added a new layer of dust to the bunker, making everything more akin to an abandoned tomb than the headquarters of an army.The shells still pound overhead, but another sound begins filling the corridors.The panting of a man, and the lopsided run of a man favoring a limp formed contrasting legato and staccato notes all formed into a desperate song, proceeding him and following him both with chaotic echoes.Trying to round a corner as fast as possible, the man's blood-smeared hand can't form a grip.The smear of his hand print would linger long to tell the tale of his mistake for long to come as more dust from overhead caked it to the wall.Slamming into the wall on the side he was favoring, a once booming voice choked out a raspy swear.There was too much adrenaline and fear in him to stay occupied on the pain, however, and he scrambled admirably quickly up the rest of the hallway he intended to take.He didn't bother to look behind him as he ran.It's not like he wasn't already going his fastest, and seeing what was coming for him wasn't going to help any if it caught up.Breaching past the entrance of the only door at the end, the man turned around and fervently pulled on the vault-style door in an effort to seal it.However, he was either too weak or the door too warped by the constant assault above.He felt nearly resigned to his fate, until he saw the panel of switches next to him.A finger shakily rose, and against all hope, toggled the main breaker down.The room roared to life on its private generators.It was largely unfinished, considering that they hadn't even had the time to properly construct walls and floors here.It was more cave than bunker, with boot-gripping grates for floors that hovered above the cold stone and upturned lights that began to illuminate all the way to where the room simply became a chasm.Even the growing collection of flood-lights could not showcase the bottom of the chamber.He didn't need there to be anywhere else to run.No, with the power still working here, he didn't even need to be able to close the door behind him.Not if he was fast enough.Huge computers dominated both sides of every wall on the way to the chasm, all leading into bunches of cables and wiring that lacked the aesthetics of a lab that had time to show a little dignity.He wasn't about to complain, however, as the apparatus that loomed over the walk-way to oblivion began to hum to life.For the first time in a long time, he smiled.His one good hand began to flip all the switches, turn all the nobs.He didn't know *how* the scientists had been able to pull this off, but he did demand to know how to use it.This project had been consuming him long before the world around began to crumble.It might even be why the world was crumbling; he'd poured *so much* into its creation.He mused, however, that it didn't matter if everything was about to end.That was the point of the device.Once completed, it was meant for an army.In its current state, it was good enough for one.That was all he needed.Feverishly, he began turning the knobs to get a desirable result to blink into place on the bubble-glass display.Checking over his shoulder quickly to the door, he saw nothing... but his heart skipped a beat as his desired input was met with a warning red light and a disapproving klaxon.Eyes flared wide, he tried adjusting to something similar... anything!Anything that would work.His breath quickened, and his precision over the knobs and dials faltered with every contrasting buzz that denied his intent.He'd just resorted to slamming his fist on the console of in rage when he felt a pair of eyes staring him down.Taking a long time to swallow and compose himself, he finally turned to stare down the hallway he was unable to seal behind him.Somehow, it was worse that he could only see its eyes reflecting light in the shadowy void of the hallway than seeing it in its entirety.Shaking his head in denial, he winced in acknowledgement of his fate as the beast strode into the light.
