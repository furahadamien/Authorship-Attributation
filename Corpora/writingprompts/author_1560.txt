Quick comment: First time posting here so sorry if I violated some rule I didnt know about

Hi, my names death.Nice to meet you. I saw the businessman in the suit in front of me shiver and hide behind his briefcase.Id seen his time coming, pathetic human that he was, for a long time now.Hed been my most recent assignment and I always liked to give humans a taste of the world they could not see before they died

My name is death 327.I am one of many deaths living on this little blue rock third from the Sun, just like you.We are a species, you know, just like humans and ants and everything else.We dont love a name as vulgar as death, but I suppose with what we do it makes sense.We dont know where we came from, or how we came about, but we know our purpose: reap the humans.When their time comes we kill them and send them wherever they go next

I saw the businessman before me staring around, startled, and mumbling incoherently.I gave him one last look, and then killed him, like plucking a leaf off of a branch.I watched the color drain from his face as he died, and marked another box off of the clipboard in front of me.That was number 128 today.I walked out the door of his apartment, already drifting to find the next human on my list.
