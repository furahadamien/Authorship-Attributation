A dreary day, the sky is blackened by clouds as though smothered by a swarm of ravens.A dark room, a modest room by any means, with shelves of books and tables littered with various paints and brushes.Torn canvases and splintered wood litter the floor, and in the darkened corner an easel stands guard over its fallen comrade.Splattered throughout the room, alizarin crimson catches the candlelight faintly, like blood drying on the carpet.A man lies in the corner, more red stains the carpet below him.The silence screams, a storm is coming.Another man stands surveying the scene he had wrought, his hands red with either paint or blood, he cannot tell the difference now.The year is 1910, and the man's name is Adolf.The man in the corner no longer has a name.Adolf surveys the scene and looks to the remaining easel and his last canvas, a blue scene in the bottom half and an unmissable dark line marring the  center of the canvas, demarcating his progress when he was attacked.Yes, this man Adolf is a painter...

No...He is a failure.The young man steps over the carnage to reach his easel ready to dispose of his latest failure, when suddenly a man's voice shatters the void."How about we put a big ol' happy tree right here?"Adolf whips around, knife already drawn and expecting an attack.Maybe this time his luck would fail him and it would be the last.To no surprise Adolf's eyes are immediately drawn to a shadowy figure in another darkened corner, though much to his surprise this figure is unlike his usual assailants.While his usual assailants come garbed in bright strange clothing, the figure standing before him is simply hooded by a travel coat, much like the one Adolf himself would wear later if he lived long enough to go to the market to buy more canvas."But maybe we should give him a couple of little friends so he doesn't get lonely, and maybe above we'll put in a couple happy little clouds"

The figure approaches Adolf and opens his cloak, and Adolf pivots to avoid the gun shot that would never come, as the man brings out his hands to produce a set of fresh brushes and a newly prepared palette of paint."I think this is already turning out to be a beautiful piece, it has so much potential, just like every one of us."The figure continues to intone as he brushes by a startled Adolf, approaching the canvas in the corner with a 2 inch brush already dipping in a dab of titanium white.There Adolf stood in wonder as this mysterious man begins adding blobs of white to his last canvas, which suddenly brings out a burst of anger Adolf didn't think he had the energy left to muster."Leave this place at once!If you're not here to kill me, cease touching my work and leave me to fix my mistake before it fully dries!"The young exhausted man shouts.The hooded figure turns around and reaches up slowly to remove his hood as the rumblings of thunder denote the coming storm.Candlelight dimly illuminates the stranger's bared face.A face with deep smile lines and large curly hair the likes of which young Adolf had never seen before."We don't make mistakes"

Says the figure, locking eyes with young Adolf and smiling sadly."We only have happy little accidents" he finishes as lighting flashes to reveal a beautiful spruce pine on the shore of some placid and unnamed lake framed by a light blue sky and wispy clouds behind the strange, smiling man.A new beginning.
