Uruk was not First to Think, or even third.Effa was First, but Effa's mate had a brain as thick as his muscles, and Effa's children did not Think.Ora and Atha despised the stupid, cleaved only to each other, and had no children at all.Uruk grew tall, but soft, since he would rather watch than run.In time, he understood man-that-was-Uruk, man-that-was-not-Uruk, and Even man-who-was-not-Uruk-but-same-clan, a mighty Thought that made his head feel like an egg hatching.Clan left Uruk when the herd moved on, but o once he recovered from his Thought, other thoughts came easier.By the time he caught up top Clan, he was much changed.What was soft had become like rope, and where Clan carried rock and club, Uruk carried spear.In time, Uruk took a mate,  Eya, whose instincts hovered just on the edge of Thought.Eya's brother did not like Uruk, and threatened him with a mighty club.The next morning, Eya's brother was dead.And so it was.Uruk and Eya had many children, and Clan who challenged Uruk died in the night.Uruk was not First to Think, or First to Kill, but First to Murder.When at last Uruk died, he went down into the Underworld, where an army of demons awaited him.He held their undivided attention for an age, until Egaho, First to Lie and Unathin, First to Betray joined him, splitting the army attention.As the she's passed, the ranks of the Damned grew and the demons were spread thin.In time, the demons forgot the Firsts, and Uruk was thrown into the Lake of Blood, with the other murderers.Uruk was soft, but only for his era.To souls that had known bronze or even steel, he was implacable.He walked through the boiling liquid,  and climbed stop the first mound of bodies he found.There he watched, until he understood the way the demons moved.In his stillness, even the other murderers forgot him.In time, the moment came when no one was looking.In the next moment, one of the demons that kept the souls from climbing out of the Lake was gone.Beneath the mound of bodies, in a cavity dug out from boiled and crushed flesh, Uruk practiced his Art for the first time in millions of years, deftly severing the creature from reality, using its own spikes and blades and bones for tools.Once he had those tools, further opportunities were easier to find.With each Ending the blood grew a little cooler, the ash a little finer, until Uruk forgot Uruk in an endless haze of murder and miniscule relief.When at last the first soul climbed out of the Lake and ran cackling into the desert, barely evading the demonic cohort, it was time to leave.He stood, shaking off the souls that had perched atop his massive frame, and walked across a bridge of bodies to the shore, naked save for his grisly arsenal.The demons fell back, recognizing the anatomy from which his weapons were drawn.The souls backed away too, save for a little blonde boy with an angelic smile, who asked, "Who are you, mister?"He thought, and then he Thought, and finally he said, "I am Kagemaro, and I will have my revenge."
