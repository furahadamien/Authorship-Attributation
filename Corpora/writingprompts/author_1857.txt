Guard, to my left.Thirty-five.Explains how he how got stuck in this shitty assignment.Tan line on his left hand ring finger.Hard luck there, buddy.In front of me, the warden.Fifty-two.Not bad, but I wouldn't spend a lot of weekends at the track, if you know what I mean."Benny," says he, "do you know why you're here?""'Cause I did something dumb," says I."Yes, Benny.Breaking into the largest jewelry store in the world in the middle of the day might qualify as dumb," says he.Oh, that smug grin on his face, I am gonna laugh for days when I Shawshank my way out of this shithole.It ain't even gonna hard.One look at the guards tells me they're stuck with the piss-poor fortune their mamas gave them.And they can't have even noticed mine, since they ain't got that nervous look that people tend to get when they see the big old 100 floating about my head.Why, you're in the 20s, you can't shake hands with me without dropping some loose change right in my pocket, and I do mean that real literal.The only unlucky thing about me was the day my momma named me Reginald, and a quick walk to the county courthouse fixed that right up.Then, I hit the town.Vegas, specifically.There's a law, see, says casinos can't discriminate against people based on luck rating.There's another that says they can't advertise to people with low ratings.Not direct, anyway.They can only kick you out if they think you're cheating, which members of the 100 club - folks like me - always end up being suspected of cheating.So when I'd cleaned out every casino I could, I moved on.Stock trading made me money, but it was boring, man, boring.You ever talk to stock traders?I don't even know if they're speaking English half the time.So I took me a much more interesting job, if you're catching my drift.It's my third time in the slammer.I pled guilty 'cause for folks like me, a fair and speedy trial just don't exist.You get one, or you get the other.Every jury you pick is gonna be stacked with folks just like me who are gonna sympathize with every word outta my mouth.So the selection process takes months.Then you have the actual trial which is a nightmare.No.Thank.You.So I get caught, I plead guilty.I get locked up.I get out.Every time."No siree," says I to the warden."The dumb thing wasn't trying the trick, the dumb thing was getting caught."The warden dismisses me with a motion of his hand.The guard - 35 to my left there - walks me to the yard.And that's when I see something that just don't seem right - 100s, everywhere.Floating over everyone's head."From here on out," the guard says, "everything you do, you do on your own.Every door you open closes another, every path you walk closes one more, and you yourself work all the controls.We are only here to subdue the ones who try to get out, and luck can't save you from an automatic rifle and two 12 gauges all firing at once."
