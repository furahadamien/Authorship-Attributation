"G'day!Today we'll be bushwackin' round the 'lysian Fields!Some of you may recognize the name from *Greek Mythology!* Keep your eyes peeled, because you never know what we may find out here...it could be the ghost of Hercules, or the spirit of Prometheus, or...


"Crikey, would you take a look at this!This is a rare sight indeed.What we have here is a Cyclops!Like many creatures, the Cyclops is quite misunderstood.Few of 'em are given the chance to be heroes, but looks like our friend heah made the cut!Good on ya, mate!"The main way to tell a cyclops from anywhere else is to sneak up behind 'em and stick a finger in their bum!If they react at all, they're probably a Cyclops!"Of course, I'm kiddin' - a little gallows humor from beyond the grave.Nah, the Cyclops is recognized by the single eye plopped smack in the middle of 'is forehead!Not many know that Cyclops means 'circle eye' - cycle like bicycle!"Now, what I usually do with Cykes is I pull out my spell book of *white magic*.You can also get by with any kind of flame-enchanted blade - a flame saber, or a Scimitar of the Salamander People - typical kit you can get at any Afterlife Exploration store."But I love the classics.So I've got my turtle shell heah, an' some sheep gut.This is sheep gut from the Chios sheep but really any breed'll do.We'll show you how to do this yourself later in the episode.And as I strum this melody...our friend heah's gonna go right ta sleep!"Now that 'e's down for a snooze, we can get a closer look.Wouldya look at some of these markings - blimey!These're from arrowheads, up heah, an' if I had ta guess I'd say they're from a fight with *Argonauts*.An' here's a spot where the poor fella's been done with a speah or two - ouch!"Ooo...I'm gonna very quickly activate my amulet now, which gives me an *Aura of Benificence*.And it's got nothin' ta do with our one-eyed friend here...and everything to do with the sudden *chillin' of my blood.* Which tells me that there's...ah, yup, I see 'im!I'll just step outta the way...


"I hope you can see this at home - this spectral form with two glowin' eyes is known as a *wraith.* An' I have ta say, ya never want ta get too close to them - as they may *drain you of all happiness* and *consume your eternal soul.* Doesn't sound too pleasant, does it?"But I'm just going ta cast a quick *binding charm*, and then we'll get right up next to the fella.Ooo, look out!Looks like my charm wasn't completely effective - look at 'im go!But as I strengthen the ephemeral restraints, he'll slowly realize there's no escape."Wraiths have a bad reputation from folks blunderin' into their habitat an' often disturbing the *site of their Earthly remains.* Nothin' 'll get these ghosties fired up more quickly then steppin' on their graves.They're nocturnal, though, sleepin' most of the day and comin' out ta go on walkabout at night.Best way to steer clear: avoid old cemeteries, 'specially after dark."Now I'm gonna back away from 'im slowly, and release my magical hold.We'll let the ghostie float on back to 'is crypt, and that's that."Speakin' o' which, it's 'bout time I head back ta *my* crypt.We'll have to save the lyre lesson 'til next time.For Ethereal Planet, I'm Steve Irwin, an' thanks for watchin' Afterlife Hunter!"* * * 

*Edit for formatting and because Steve forgot to tell the viewer how to make their own lyre.*

Mark took a deep breath, then pushed open the door to the bar.He ordered a Greyhound on the rocks and took a moment to survey the room.It was getting crowded, but not yet to that "rub up against multiple strangers just to cross the room" point.Embers of hope began to glow inside Mark.Maybe this could work.He smiled to himself, surveying the room.A few pool tables, a few dart boards, and...shit, a shuffleboard table.It even looked like it was in decent condition.Maybe he could see if one of the young women drinking what looked like vodka and cranberry juice wanted to -- 

A patron bumped into Mark, and said "Watch it, dingus" without breaking stride.That's when things took a turn.The face of the small-but-portly man standing on Mark's left shoulder went scarlet with poorly-contained rage."The FUCK did you just call me?Hey FUCKNUTS, don't walk away from me, I'm talkin to you!"Mark cringed.Some of the people closest to him were staring now, others were nudging their friends.Still, as long as there was no response from Nigel, things would probably -- 

"The language of the bard.Truly, your words drop as gentle rain from heaven."So much for that idea."Shut it, Limey, or I'll rip off your GOD DAMN CRUMPETS and dunk 'em in that SHIT WATER you call tea!"A wave of silence had washed over the room.A few dozen cell phones seemed to have materialized out of thin air, all of them held aloft and pointed at Mark."Quite."Mark sighed and began trying to pick his way through the assembled on-lookers.He was muttering, for the hundredth time, a prayer about being able to get out of the room before -- 

"What are you lookin at, big tits?'Ey, don't get mad at me - get mad at whoever told you you could fit those giant melons in that tube top."Mark raced out of the bar, getting home as fast as he could.He pulled a piece of paper off his dresser and brought it to the table.He scanned two-thirds of the way down the page before he found the name of the bar and crossed it out.*Maybe tomorrow would be better*, he thought ruefully.***

G'ol Bognil let out an expansive sigh as he settled his considerable girth before the marble table."Alright, before we get started, remind me your names and classes again?"Lethus did not move but a phlegmy mutter emanated from under this black hood."I am Steve.The dentist."Polara was next to speak.Her glittering obsidian eyes dropped down to the character sheet in front of her."I am a dual-class business exec and accountant named Mike the Magnificent."G'ol Bognil blinked."That sounds a bit over-powered to me...what is your backstory?"A ghost of a smile appeared momentarily on Polara's black lips."My father dedicated his life to the Demon of Alcohol and my mother was a pathetic weakling.I worked two jobs to put myself through college and then graduate school, where I studied under the tutelage of some of the mightiest professors in the land."The bulbous, warty nose of G'ol Bognil wrinkled."I feel like your characters always manage to receive the tutelage of some of the mightiest professors in the land.One of these days I am going to make you play a waitress."Polara drew herself upright, the torch light reflecting off the onyx pendant around her neck."The earthly vessel of Burkh the Devourer does not play waitresses."G'ol Bognil rolled his eyes and then let out a loud belch."And finally...?"The goblin king turned to look at a veritable mountain of a man whose face was almost completely lost behind wavy crimson hair and a bushy, fiery beard."I, Garung the Decimator, Eviscerator of the Plainsmen and Bane of the Thrak, am playing..." 

Garung's brow creased as he squinted at his paper."Millie, the Soccer Mom."Polara snorted.There was no way to tell, but something about the dark aura surrounding Lethus suggested he was smirking.G'ol Bognil, however, frowned."What...can Myley do?""Millie.Her rumor and gossip skills are maxed out, so she is a powerful information broker.After years of training, the High Council of Home Owners has made her queen, meaning she wields the full power of the Covenants of C&R.Her arch-rival is Kaylie, Supreme Leader of the Association Between Parents and Teachers."G'ol Bognil sighed."Try to keep it IC, please.In the faraway land of North Suburbtown, they do not have queens or supreme leaders - they have presidents and heads."Somewhere behind his giant beard Garung the Decimator was scowling but he said nothing.G'ol Bognil opened a flask of Mountain Ale and took a long pull, then belched again."Alright.It is Saturday, and you all find yourselves at the Park of Dark Cul-de-Sac.Mike, you are here for a company picnic/fundraiser.Steve, you are watching your son play in the Tournament of Soccer, where he and his companions are trying to best the All-Stars of Cityhome.And...Millie --"

Polara made an amused noise that she tried to cover by sniffing loudly. 

"-- you, of course, are coaching a different team nearby.The sky is gray - strangely overcast for a day in April.The green lawns squish slightly under the feet of the Tournamenteers, and various obese humans sit in flimsy makeshift thrones to watch.The sounds of dogs barking ring out from the housing development, swelling ever louder...as you turn in the direction of the noise, you see a gazebo looming in the distance..."
