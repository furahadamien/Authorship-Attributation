"What the ACTUAL F--" I stopped short, conscious of my 5-year-old girl's presence behind me."What is it, Daddy?"she asked innocently, and more than a little concerned."What...I...how..."I sputtered, unable to produce a coherent word.It was Christmas morning, and I'd woken up and had breakfast as usual.Closing my eyes for a moment, I'd wished my wife was still around to share this beautiful winter morning with us."First Christmas without her," I'd thought sadly.I'd closed my eyes for a moment.My thoughts had turned to our daughter.She was the most precious creature in the world to me, and I guard her like a lioness guards her cubs.I couldn't afford to let something or other take her away from me like a car accident ripped my wife away from us.I'd gone to check if she was awake, but she'd been staring out of the window at a crowd of neighbours pointing at our house and chattering among themselves.Some had their phones out, snapping away.Naturally I opened the front door with every intention to chase them away tactfully, but the minute I stepped outside, I saw the most unbelievable sight I had ever laid eyes upon.A fire-breathing, coal-black horse was stamping around my front yard, neighing and tossing its admittedly majestic mane about.That was where I screamed in shock.Abby's eyes grew rounder and rounder.She displayed no sign of fear, though, which seemed more than a little odd.Finally she spoke."I think Santa made a mistake.""Mistake?What?What's happening?"I questioned her."You see, Daddy, remember when I told you I wanted a pony and you told me to write to Santa?I did write to him, but this isn't what I asked for.I wanted a black pony that breathes sparkles, with a rainbow mane.Something went wrong somewhere," she explained.After I somehow chased all the neighbours away, I awkwardly led the horse to the back yard where fewer people would likely see it.There was a small piece of paper tied to the horse's left ear, and I untied it.Its contents were as follows:

"Dear Abby,

I think you must have made a mistake.We do not have glitter-spitting ponies with rainbow manes down here in Hell, but never let it be said the devil is so evil that he cannot grant happiness to a 5-year-old child.I did my best to find a suitable pony for you.This is one of our finest; in fact we were planning to use him for the Apocalypse, but I guess we'll have to change plans now.He's already broken in so you can have some fun right away without worrying about training and all that.Terribly sorry, of course, if you don't like him.But he's the best horse we could find in all of Hell's stables.Merry Christmas.Yours Sincerely
Satan

P.S.This is the first time anyone's asked me to provide them a present for a holiday dedicated to my arch nemesis' birthday.I kindly request that you never do this again."Understanding cleared out the cloud of confusion in my brain as I read the note.Abby must've spelled Santa as Satan.I chuckled a little as I wondered what it would feel like to have to make someone happy on the birthday of someone whom you've rivalled your entire life."Come, Abby, let's give you some riding lessons..."
