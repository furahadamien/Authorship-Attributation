"Come on, come on come on..."

"I can't focus with you breathing down my neck!""**I'M** not the one breathing down your neck!""Well whoever it is stop!""Why don't we all just relax and figure out a solution together.""Oh stuff it you - you know what, **ALL OF YOU JUST STUFF IT**!"*Chicken Soup.How hard could it be?* *Gran made it every weekend for the past who-knows-how-long before she died.So why was this happening now?Why did a portal from hell open in my kitchen?Why did a demon crash onto my (only) table?And why for the love of all that is decent in the world did it have to have multiple heads?*

"Hey buddy, please go slower if you can.It's not like we have anywhere to be except - OH YEAH, TORTURING SOULS AND DOING MY MASTERS BIDDING!""WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU MAN- uh, whatever it is that you are!- I don't know what happened.One minute I'm mixing  ingredients together and the next POOF!I have a demon in my house and there's brimstone everywhere and it now smells like rotten eggs where I eat!""You know, I don't very much like this change in ownership.I liked the way things were with Martha.""Hold up - how do you know my Gran?""NO WAY.""Wait, are you Jackson?""...Yes.""You're related to Martha?The Scourge of Oblivion?""I mean, we called her Gran before she passed, but yeah, I guess so.""Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.She was a lovely woman; always baking us treats to take back home.""She will be missed deeply.""Uh, thanks I guess.""Well,  since it seems you're the one who has had the book passed down to you, \*AHEM\* Jackson of...um, we'll figure out a title for you later-you are the rightful owner to the Tome of Incantations: Mephistopheles edition"

"Congratulations.""..."
