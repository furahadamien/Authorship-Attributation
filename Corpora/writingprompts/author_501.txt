It started with one voice, but that was just the whispering, whistling roar of the atomic bomb falling downwards; in movies or cartoons, everything apart from that thin, shrieking noise would fall away--as it did in that revelatory moment of shattered reality, when the bee spoke--and it would seem like all of creation was waiting with all breath indrawn for the moment of detonation.Then it happens, titanic majesty and awful destruction, and everything is reduced in mere moments to ashes of what had been; that was the moment after the bee spoke, when his brain--dormant and waiting for the moment of connection--was instantaneously bound to every queen (and through her every bee) across this world and beyond.He barely understood then the beyond; that worlds evolving in parallel across an infinity of physical and paradimensional space were also connected through him.His mind saw the infinite and stepped back, a metaphysical reflex response that very few people ever get to experience, but the heat and power of that moment (not to mention the sudden assault of this world's bees upon his senses) was enough to shear away the layers of his personality.It felt like being torn apart and reborn, again and again and again, and it was equal parts exalting and soul-destroying - like a version of medieval flagellation that actually worked, purifying and empowering the soul through blissful suffering.In reality it was over in mere moments, before his eyes could even blink once, but entire universes of knowledge had--for that flicker--been his, and he had delved deep, and seen others delving deeper still.Just like that almighty nuclear explosion, however, it also faded away.It became like an imprint of the sun against your eyelid, when you've been squinting at that gaseous old nuclear fireball too long, and with each pulsing second it seemed to fade away even more, leaving only the shadow of a memory.Jacob just stood there for a moment; his brain felt like his body should need to collapse, or possibly be blown away in the wind like so many ashes in the bloom of a nuclear hailstorm, but his body didn't seem to need to - and, as his brain continued to reflexively protect itself from immediately destructive understanding, that thought of impending doom was also swept away.Eventually, all he was left with--beyond a number of questions (born of that moment) that he would definitely be wanting reanswered--was a deep, but surprisingly not hysterical, curiosity about the bee that had landed on his shoulder and said: "Your Majesty, what are your orders?"To which he replied aloud, to the surprise of all the other people in the queue for coffee, "Tell me what the fuck is going on," He paused for a moment, then reflexively added, "Please."
