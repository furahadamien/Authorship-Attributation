"Alright, first we have a department store.We fill it with the bare minimum employees, but whenever someone asks for help we are always just beyond their reach.We'll be shadows at the corner of their eyes whenever they come in looking after for some batteries or a return they have from another store.Once inside we seal off the front end portal and black out the windows.We shut off the lights section by section starting drom the front.We would leave our stations and vacate the premise for the next part when the store blacks out.At this point, the most ignorant customers break out their phones and flashlights.For this, I ask we sap all the power from them.""Wait wait wait wait.Why wouldn't you just make them work for you?Or lecture them while you poke their innards or something?What's your end game?"He asks while interrupting me, his brow cocked as he questions me."For fucks sake Mephisto--"

*"Mephistopheles!"* He roars."Whatever.Stop interrupting me, cause there's a fucking point.Anyway, their phones are inevitably at one percent.Those that aren't aware yet will come out looking for outlets to charge at.We'll know where they are, and we'll take them, lobotomize them, and throw a polo on them."I look at the devil.He stares for a hot second."So you're making them employees?""Yes.But every night we place the older ones in the bailer and abduct new ones who straggle after close."I am smug and think I'm clever for thinking this up."The horror is all in the impending darkness and how it encroaches on them.The torture is all psychological!They can't get what they want in hell and with braindead workers."Mephistopheles takes a breath."Mister Nguyen...Here at Hell Incorporated and Fallen Star Torture Depot, we really want to create tailor made horrors that will squeeze more humanity and essence from the core of mortals."He brings the blackened sharp tips of his fingers together over the obsidian manager's desk."I think we can start tomorrow.We like your talent and think we can develop you into a great lord of grief at our company."Compared to my last job, I actually believe my manager really wants me to get ahead in this life.Note: I don't write very often, but this was fun.
