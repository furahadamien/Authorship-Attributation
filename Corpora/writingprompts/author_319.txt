He looked at his hands.They gradually withered and wrinkled before his eyes.He closed his eyes.He opened his eyes.Up raised his now-withered hands.Their skin steady.He felt his sagging face.In a concerted effort, he jerked forward, into his head on the back of the pillow.There he lay again, eyes reopening.Back at his hands, back to withering.A thousand thoughts raced through his head, racing like real time over his never-so-mortal coil.But one thought rung through them all.*So this was reality.* To dream or to live as things are.Panic arose in his breast.It fed itself.The more he panicked the less he'd be able to return to sleep and dream the rest of his life.So, calmly, his heart slowed as fast as it begun.Godspeed his decision.Lids lazy.There he lay.Wrote this within a 10-minute time limit as a challenge.
