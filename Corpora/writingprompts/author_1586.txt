I started my day by strutting into the office wearing the most ridiculous outfit I could find.Khaki shorts with knee-length leotard socks, a hawaian tee and flip-flops that kept click-clacking on the linoleum floor.My colleagues kept throwing me irritated glances, and I could hear whispers between some of them.Karen, the secretary, scowled when she saw me, but didn't say anything because the boss Mr. Hughes stood next to her with a bunch of documents in his hands."Eric!Just the guy I've been waiting for!Come by in an hour or so and we can grab a cup of coffee and chat over the next testing phase.""Sure thing boss," I greeted and slapped Karen's ass.She squealed, no doubt due to how bold I was.Winking was hard after the fire, but I didn't mind.The red-blue flesh hanging from my eyelids stuttered a few times while I was trying to give her a second wink."See you later.Bitch!"I passed her by and turned around with a grin on my burned out lips and both my hands raised as high as my half-functioning muscles would allow."Ayyyy, nice one, Eric!My boss cheered.&#x200B;

I finished my morning routine by taking a shit in front of the office's kitchen and wiping my ass with Karen's (then unopened) bag of toast.I may not be fireproof.But I am, *fire-proof.*
