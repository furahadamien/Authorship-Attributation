"It's fuckin bullshit!"yelled Marty."Look at this shit!It's dropped four points this morning."Marty refilled his cup from the office's lunchroom coffee pot."I don't even get to see my kids til next month thanks to that stupid bitch and her new fucktard boyfriend.""Aren't they engaged now?"ask Christopher."Whatever.""Hey at least you won't have to pay alimony anymore.""Bout fuckin time.Bitch has been bleedin me dry."Marty added more sugar to the cursed cup
and took a sip.The new intern must have made the coffee again.Never could get it right.That's what you get for hiring interns that don't drink coffee."Just last week her fuckin lawyer sent me another damn letter!Sayin I missed another damn visit!I fuckin work, woman.She thinks we're all up here just drinkin fuckin coffee all damn day.Let's see her get a damn job and see how much free time she has.""Well, she is looking after 3 kids...." Chris trailed off."She knows damn well I had to go to Vegas and deal with a client!That's what pays the bills
around here.She fuckin knows that!How many fucking ballerina recitals do I gotta go to anyway?Who the hell wants to watch a bunch of kids twirling around in tights all fuckin night!I got shit to do.""How was Vegas anyway?"asked Chris."Fucking Awesome."Marty's face lit up."Took the client to the peelers.You know that out of 
the way place off the strip?Yeah you know the place!Yeah, took him there.Fuckin blew his mind!All them girls twirling around on stage all fuckin night!Now there's some girls that need a Daddy!"Marty's coffee cup ticked down another two points.Roger tuned them out.He picked up his cup and wandered back to his desk.Sitting down,
he pressed the space bar on his keyboard to wake the computer up, but his eyes wandered back
to the cup.That damn'd cup!Last week it had been blank.Just an ordinary white cup his wife
had given him before...This week it showed number 2 billion and something.Bringing up Google he queried "population of earth".The result said 7 billion and change.Rogers eyes welled up again.An estimated 7 billion people in the world and he ranked worse than
2 billion other people as a father.Even that asshole Marty was in the low millions.He looked at the cup again."Who are you?"he whispered."Where are you?"Picking up the picture of his deceased wife made his heart beat faster.They'd only been married 
for two years.They'd always talked about having kids.It just hadn't happened.It'd been three years since the accident.He hadn't met anyone since.Hadn't wanted to.His hand caressed his wife's face in the picture.Her eyes looked imploringly at him through
the cheap glass."I'll find her... or him."He set the picture down beside the keyboard."I don't know who it was, or when.I....I don't even know where to start."Tears started rolling down his cheeks.University has been twelve years ago.High School was over 15 years.He couldn't even remember the name of his prom date let alone any serious girlfriends.Had any of them been.... 

Was he actually a ...?He looked at the picture again forgetting about the cup for the first time in days.A sense of urgency came over him tinged with hope.His chest tightened.His hands grasped
the arms of the chair."I promise you.I will find them.I will be the man you married!"His lips cracked a smile even as his throat tightened."I will be the father I was meant ... " he voice cracked and he wiped tears from his face."I.Will.Be.A.Father!"Unseen, the number on his coffee cup ticked upwards.One point.

So let me get this straight...He just 'materialized' ?Outside?In those clothes?I don't care if he's done this before!He's never done 'it' up here, has he!Wait, has he?No, of course not.Do any of your other childhood sweet hearts appear of nowhere like this?No.Just the ones who sing Jackson 5 songs at karaoke birthday parties?Yeah just him, I got it.So, you were outside.You came untethered and, in your own words, you panicked.Do I have that right so far?Ok, and then what...He just appeared?Just like that?A guy you haven't seen in four years, wearing shorts, flip flips, and a sun hat blinks into existence just outside the ...  what module was it again?Tranquility?So we should be glad he's not wearing a speedo and riding a surfboard this time?Wait.... what runway?NO, never mind, forget I asked that.Look, I know he can't be a stoy-away, I came up on the last ... You and I both came up together!!That was months ago.It's not like there's anywhere up here for him to hide.Even if he had been here the whole damn time, where would he have gotten a FUCKING LAWN MOWER!?Commander!Human Beings DO NOT just POP in existence outside the International Space Station holding a BEER!....  

Houston, this is...  
  

Houston, there's been a...

Houston, We have a problem.
