*Sparky Ralst was just found dead.His throat was slashed and his heart was stabbed, characteristic signs of the Lionview Killer.It seems he has finally made it into Grandston, locals need to lock their doors and report any suspicious activity to Grandston law enforcement...*

Hayden sighed and turned off the television.The Lionview Killer had traveled a thousand miles all the way to his town of Grandston, murdering all the while.All of those killed had been pure of heart and soul.Most had been famous for their work in therapy, search and rescue, the military, hospitals, or other great things.Some had simply been great friends of everyone in town, which is just as bad of a loss.All of those who died had been of strict benefit to society, and it made Hayden furious to think this killer was trying - and succeeding - to take the good out of the world.Hayden had never been the purest of people, he probably would've been rooting for the killer if he targeted those that needed to be eradicated - pedophiles, rapists, those sort.A good vigilante would probably be someone he would stand behind - silently of course.But this?Good souls being stripped from the earth?It made him sick.Sitting up and folding down the recliner, Hayden pushed himself to his feet.He needed to get up and do something to get his mind off of the fact that a murderer was now present in his quiet friendly neighborhood."Ralphie!C'mere boy, let's go for a walk."He said, smiling as he heard his best friend's nails scrabble against the hardwood floor as soon as "walk" left his mouth.It was half a second later that Hayden saw the giant paws of a gangly, disproportionate mutt galloping at him from around the corner.Hayden patted him on the head and clipped the leash to his collar, "Alright boy, let's get some fresh--" 

*CRACK!BANG!*

The loud noise was immediately recognized as his back door breaking at the lock and slamming open.Hayden turned around just in time to see the silhouette of a hooded figure and a streak of irridescent purple twirl through the air, where it thudded dully against Ralphie's chest.The goofy, loving mutt fell to the floor without a sound.A look of horror spread across Hayden's face as he turned to watch numbly as the hooded figure advanced on him and his fallen dog.The description of the brief sightings matched everything.This was the Lionview Killer.Anger ran hot through Hayden's veins as he lunged towards the hooded figure with blind rage.How dare he come into his home!How dare he hurt Ralphie!An animalistic roar tore through his throat as he went to grab the slim figure and throw his head into the hardwood floor Ralphie's claws had been scrabbling moments before.The killer dodged easily, movements as fluid as water, and reached down silently to grab the dagger from the chest of the dog.Blood poured from the wound as the killer went to finish it with the slash across the throat - his signature.Hayden spun around, "Oh no, you're not getting away, and don't you touch him!"Fury gave Hayden's large form speed as he barreled into the hooded figure.He hit the guy and a startled grunt came from him.They rolled on the floor briefly and Hayden grabbed hold of the irridescent purple knife."Here!TAKE SOME OF YOUR OWN MEDICINE!"And he was arcing the knife through the sky, down towards the murderer.But Hayden had no combat training.He had no skills other than the mostly fat and some muscle that lent him an advantage against the slight and thin form of the hooded figure, and the Lionview Killer obviously knew his way around a knife.It was stripped from Hayden's hand mid motion, and while the killer didn't try to turn the knife onto Hayden, they fell clumsily in a heap and Hayden felt a sharp stitch of pain right below his ribs.Gasping, he rolled off and saw the knife protruding at an angle from his chest, stabbing directly towards his heart.Hayden felt his breath hitch in his throat.He couldn't  breathe.He was wide-eyed, shocked, and dying in a pool of his dogs blood.The Lionview Killer was cursing under his breath, angry and frantic as he tried to think of a way Hayden could be saved from this.Think of a way everything wouldn't be ruined.But no, the angle of the knife was obvious, Hayden would die.The killer had been sloppy, and it cost him all of his plans.He yanked the knife from Hayden's body and began to clean it, shaking his head with disappointment.Just before Hayden's last breath, he croaked, "Why?Why are you doing this?"The Lionview Killer looked down at his pathetic, dying body and sighed, "You'll see soon enough."Everything went black for Hayden, but he was quick to feel consciousness again as sunlight shone on his eyelids.He opened them, surprised to see he was completely healed, surprisingly fit, and laying on a bed of luscious green grass.Hefting himself up on his elbows, he looked around and saw the most magnificent thing.Dogs of all shapes and sizes frolicking, playing, napping, woofing.A few looked at him and tilted their head, as if they werent expecting to see him.A few wagged their tails in his direction.A couple approached him and gave him a good sniff and a lick before heading off.And then Hayden saw him.His gangly, goofy good-boy."Ralphie!!"He hugged his dog as Ralphie tackled him, and decided this was the sort of world he could live happily in.
