Vamps4Lycanthropes
I am told that with The Order of Secrecy being repealed that we are to only start with only small things.Stories of vampires have been spread for so long I don't think anyone truly believes or considers us to be real.So we are to start telling knew stories.By posting in forums and publishing fiction we will begin to paint our people in a more realistic light.(Or by posting extremely late to a random WP) If we can get our human brethren to consider us as people and not monsters then it will be the time for us to officially announce ourselves.Until then, let me, obviously a fictional character, tell you about an interaction I had with my best friend last week.I had been hoping to tell Emily the truth about myself since we were in high school together.I knew I must always keep my racial identity a secret, but also that obtaining a human partner was one of the highest pleasures and honors a vampire can obtain.Naturally, I went to an unnamed private school through elementary, before moving onto a human public school.Using the guise of privileged and wealth to keep out humans, these private elementary schools teach young vampires our history and the importance of us keeping ourselves hidden.I remember being taught about the Salem witch trials and McCarthyism at a young age, as an example of how hysterical any group of people can become.The witch trials scared me the most because as our professor explained, there weren't even any witches involved.It was all a reaction of group think combined with fear.Part of me was scared that if I ever confided in Emily she would become terrified of me and never speak to me again.I was originally planning to tell her the summer after we turned 21, but then they actually repealed The Order.Its one of those things that gets brought up to the Council ever few decades, but no one expects to actually go through.As soon as I heard the vote had passed unanimously I started planning it out in my head.We had lived together for 3 years now.When she announced she was going over seas for college I was so proud of her, but I could tell how nervous she was.I offered to go with since all my schooling would be online and she couldn't have been more excited.In truth my online schooling involved a simple but substantially lucrative career in human sociology.Its not as fancy as it sounds, I spend a lot of time online lurking on human sites, and writing reports of my findings for The Archive.Maybe I could find a way to break the ice to her with my work.That same day I brought her out for a few drinks at the pub down the street and found us a back booth.I had everything planned out in my head, but I was extremely nervous."Do you like vampire stories?"I blatantly asked."Not in particular, I mean, they are alright.Why?""Because I am a vampire and I think they are a bunch of bullshit," I was so nervous saying this, but played it off very blatantly.Emily recovered from swallowing her beer the wrong way, "Oh, really!Are you feeling marginalized, ha!"I screwed up all of my resolve and plunged straight in forgetting everything I had planned to say, "the truth is I am a vampire and I have always wanted to tell you and I don't want you to think I am crazy or believe me and be afraid of me or loose you or worse you panic and start a witch hunt," I quickly dissolved from my sarcastic stoic facade to honest tears and a quivering lip.I started to sob, "You are my best friend and I want to share what I am with you, but your already looking at me like I'm crazy."I was fully crying into my untouched beer at this point as Emily stared at me dumbfounded and confused.Her reaction had transformed from amused to annoyed to concerned with my torrent of words."What are you talking about?What do you mean, are you being serious?"I nodded my face in my hands as I continued to cry.I should mention at this point that Emily has seen me cry twice.The first was when we saved a baby bunny and it died, and the second was at classmate's funeral.I don't really cry, and I most certainly do not sob or bawl.She slid out from behind the table and next to me in my booth."Seriously, what is going on?You can't expect me to believe you are a vampire?"I took a deep breath, "Of course not, of course not.Lets just say, lets just say, I was for a moment.And I really did want to tell you, how would you expect me to prove it to you?""I am not sure this is a good idea, I think we should..."
"Please, Emily, hear me out and then I'll do whatever you think I should do about this, okay?Please, answer the question.""Well, if I were to entertain this I would want proof.Like where are your fangs, and how come you can go out during the day?""My fangs were filed when I was two like all of my kind.We have nocturnal ancestors that cause some of our kind to be sensitive to the sun just like many pale humans.""Okay..." she was looking at me like I was definitely crazy now, "um garlic, silver bullets, stake to the heart?""Garlic is a minor allergy that some of the younger generation don't even have now, but if concentrated can be used as a poison.Silver is like an allergy but a bit more complicated.It binds to receptors necessary for engaging our advanced tissue regeneration and cause us to be unable to heal.A stake to the heart would probably kill anyone.So would any bullet to the head or heart for that matter...next."She started smiling now, decided I must be stringing her along on some strange long winded prank, "Turn into a bat.""Really?Just because one of my ancestors tracked sleeping pray by picking up on the squeaks of bats feasting on the insects attracted to said pray does not mean I can turn into a bat.My hearing is far superior to yours however, and that is something that we could measure and prove.Anything else?""So are you immortal?"I took a deep breath finally feeling a bit more stabilized and prepared for the big one, the one that actually might scare people."Vampires were created hundreds of years ago by cross breading a Vamperic beast with humans.I don't want to go into that mess too much right now, but long story short all those monsters are gone and what you are left with is me, the modern day vampire.We are mostly human, with a few other genetic traits.One is the ability to restore tissue and damaged cells at an accelerated rate.This is what silver poisoning inhibits.In order to trigger the chemical reactions that initiate our body to go into healing overdrive, we have to consume blood.Human blood is the most compatible since, we are mostly human ourselves.Being exposed to direct sunlight also inhibits this process.Satisfied?"Looking at her now I could see the fear beginning to creep into her eyes.Mostly, for what she must be imagining is wrong with my mind, but I could smell another fear beginning even if she wasn't aware of it yet.Primal fear."Geese, um....don't you have to ask permission to come into anyone's home?"I started to back pedal, I would play it off as a joke, "Awe you got me, just yesterday I walked into Sam's dorm.You scolded me for it!I tried..." I don't think she was buying it."Yeah, and you justified it because he had a welcome mat!"***I hope you find these.Please talk to me Emily.I'm sorry, it was my fault.Edit: Formatting issues.
