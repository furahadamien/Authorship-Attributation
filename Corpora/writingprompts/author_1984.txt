Buddy over here looks like Santa in sunglasses and he's wearing what appears to be robes of royalty."That is quite the astute observation coming from someone who has discovered time travel.Yes I have discovered the travel of time."I'm kind of a pretentious dick but making a time machine justifies it, I think."Nah Broseph I didn't discover it, but I used it.""How did you end up with it?""Ah I shall tell you, but first we need to go to the master dining hall.I must show you the awesomeness of my power."He beckons me through this amazing hall with towering ceilings held up by gold plated masts.In front of us stretches a table that seats 18 or so people and a dozen servants.He belts out, "We will we will rock you!"and pounds the table."Pretty sick huh?Echoooeee.""Yes, that is pretty cool.Echoooeeee.now we must discuss the subject of time travel.""In due time... you like ham?Can we get some ham over here!"The servants jump into action.He swings a chair out and plops down."First, my name is Brett and I am from the future.Second, someone gave it to me.Third, they said I could do what I want and I want to party.Ladies!Ladies come on out!"A door opens and in medieval fashion, elegant dressed women enter the room.Bringing up the rear is a burly man with a whiskey barrel."Why did this someone give it to you?"I try to stay on track."It was a couple of people actually, I'm pretty much a delivery boy for them.""Oh?and what did you deliver for them?""Knowledge Bro.I just had to bring a bunch of books and some technology to this time and place.Now I do what I want here for as long as I want, that's my payment.""Aren't you worried about the repercussions your actions will have on the future?You could be dooming us all!""No I don't think so, these guys seemed to have it all planned out.Any change I make is pennies in the ocean."Okay that's scary.What does his "employer" want?Brett's train of thought shifts and you can see it on his face."Fourth, if any other time traveler should arrive they are to be killed."Brett rips off his sunglasses."And I brought guns."The servants whip out mini nukes and blow me all the way to 2017.Now I'm in the future and I don't have my time machine.
