"Aaaaaameeeeen!"The Priest's elongated moan indicated another happy customer, the Matron chuckled to herself, "there's something odd about that one".Business had been slow, it had been at least a week since the last 'freeze' and the coin tally was decidedly lighter than she'd like.Her discreet tax was much harder to levy on unfrozen patrons and shed been relying on it since the time freezes started over a year ago.To make matters worse, tomorrow was the first medicine day since the Harvest Festival two months prior and the healer was sorely needed, her poor girls were always popular during Festival season.A sigh escaped her sturdy frame as she lent over the papers at her vanity desk, she hated having to choose who would be healed and who would suffer on.With an almighty bang the door to her bedroom crashed open and a puffing red-faced ball of a Gnome hurtled in, "Ma'am!It's the Regent, he's here with his men!"The Matron barely blinked an eye to the intrusion.She stood calmly, back to the door, and walked over to her rusted copper wardrobe, its doors protesting quietly as she pulled out her finest white chiffon cloak.She span the cloak through the air, arms elegantly finding their place in the billowing fabric as she span to fix her hair in the mirror.Warn the girls, Barkeep, her voice cracked ever so slightly we cannot afford any indiscretions."--------

As she descended the stairs to the main bar she exuded wisdom and humility, eyes pointed downwards with the white cloak sweeping wide behind her.Regent. she said, her eyes flitting upwards to his seat at the main table, what a pleasure to see you.


The bar was empty, praise the gods, except for the Priests companion.The Merchant was sat in the corner booth nursing a beer, his beautiful dark blue hair glinting in the candlelight.The two Emonian travellers had been their best customers for the last three days, she knew little of them other than their professions and penchant for talking in riddles.The Regent rose briskly, sharply enough for his chair to clatter onto the floor behind him, and skulked towards her with malice in his eyes.The black buffed leather of his boots creaked on the worn floorboards as laughter rose from his group of footsoldiers, 6 men of various ages all of their eyes on her.He grabbed her by the throat and slammed her up against stairway balustrade, the force of the impact breaking one of the wooden struts.She groaned in agony as he brought his eyes to hers, two black orbs lined with pallid skin, the mark of the dagger that infamously claimed his father's life cut across from brow to nape.Then it happened, she could not believe her fortune, the dolorous sounds of bells tolled in the distance and the world around her ground to a halt.Her eyes bulged as she struggled to breath, the freeze never lasted long.Her hand slipped into her bustier and withdrew an ornate flip-blade knife, small yet sharp, a token of the Rhino Guild for all its members.She used the blade to prise open the Regents tight clenched fingers from around her throat, noting with detached interest that even his blood did not move.She dropped to her haunches and her hand flitted up to her neck.View unobscured by the Regents frame she surveyed the frozen scene that was unfolding in front of her, a painting so surreal that it must have been a dream.The soldier furthest away lay prostrate on the ground, a wooden pole protruding from his neck.It looked like the bottom half of a walking cane, the other 5 were still sneering in her direction.The Merchant  was in mid air, hed obviously launched from his table and had one arm drawn back holding what could only be described as a rapier.The handle was hooked and made of a wood that matched that of the pole that was currently embedded in the soldier.If his aim rang true, he was set to spear the burliest of the 5 soldiers right through the neck...

Flee! she shouted to herself, GODDAMNIT WOMAN FLEE!.She dragged herself up using the Regent as support and her back cascaded in pain.Wincing, she sloped towards the exit,  the world was descending into chaos and she didnt want ought to do with it.As she closed the door behind her she heard a cacophony of screeches, clattering chairs and a manic laugh.The freeze was over, she shuddered at the thought of it lasting any less time.As she turned she noted the Tramp was lurking nearby, begone with you man she implored, I have nothing for you today, the world has gone mad!

Mary Estellbar, Matron of the House of Rhino, you need to follow me, he remained in the shadows between the buildings, I have done my best to protect you but it has not been sufficient.It is not safe.

WHO ARE YOU she whispered through gritted teeth as she tried to push past him what is this, this, MADNESS?

Enough. he barked, waving his hand over her eyes, you must follow me.

Mary couldnt speak, she couldnt scream, her left foot moved involuntarily forward, and then the other, and again, and again.Do not worry child, this is for your protection.
