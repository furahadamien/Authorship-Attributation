It was a rough morning this particular day.Having some beers at the local pub didn't help calm the waves of frustration and tension I had to overcome the last couple years.The patronage was meager at best, and the draft Guinness left way too much to be imagination.I had seen families come and go, but never knew what had happened the previous day.It was called "hello fathers day" and many didn't agree with it.I myself wasn't prepared for the value of 5,627,490.What kind of dad am I to have "earned" such a distinct punch to the gut?Was I really that bad of a father?The barkeep consoled my sorrow with a fresh mug still foaming over as they used the wooden stick to cut to top off.He was unusually joyful today after so many father's had learned they too were in the 5M ranks in the local area.The news papers had photos of mugs smashed on the streets as if to protest the unusual events insignificance, whilst showing the world their arrogance and ignorance to the truth.I looked up from my freshly tasted draft and asked the barkeep why he was in such a good mood?He replied: You see that hook above the bar where all the other mugs are?I nodded in acknowledgement.That's my father's mug!So?I replied.What's so special about your father?The barkeep laughed in bewilder of my ignorance to the fact I'd never really gotten to know him, or his family.Go and get it down from there!Fine, I must know why you're in such a good mood!I go to reach for the mug, and within an instant of turning it around the mug displayed the number 1.I was shocked to see it said "1".This must be a joke barkeep!No, not at all!He replied.Who's you're father?The barkeep flexed his muscles and cried out "John Fucking Zoidberg!"
