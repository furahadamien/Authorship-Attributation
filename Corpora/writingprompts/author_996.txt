Blood covered every inch of his clothes; His button up t-shirt was white once, and his jeans dark blue, but now he was properly matching, dressed all in red."You son of a bitch."He grimaced at the man who stole his money, clenching the dirty man tightly by his shirt."You thought I wouldn't notice?That I wouldn't MIND?"Jason slammed the palm of his hand into the thieves jaw, cracking a bone and freeing a few teeth from his mouth.It had been months that he had waited for this moment, and it was worth every penny."You got away from me at River's End, and you were imprisoned by the time I found you at Hallwell.But now, now you're all mine.The trees around them watched as Jason pummeled the already bruised and black eyed burglar.The sun was setting and his energy with it.Though in truth, it was probably the weight of the body tiring him out.He dragged the bloody bastard by his ankles into the thick of the forest."You were an expensive catch.Heh."Jason talked to the ragged corpse that was once a man."I enjoy these games.You see, the world is a sick place, but it's people like YOU who ruin it's beauty."The mans head thumped on the jagged rock and ripped a fresh wound up the side of his face."Poor bastard."Jason chuckled to himself.Swinging him by the legs, he dropped him down the cliff, and his body found it's way to the river bed below."You steal from me, I steal from you!Haha!Try stealing in your afterlife if you will it!Though your balls seem to have shrunken to raisins.Who risks stealing for TEN DOLLARS?At least take a chance for something greater!Oh, I see you can't do that now."Jason ranted maniacally to himself, his heart beating ever quick.So much so that he didn't hear the man dressed in all black, come up behind him."Who are you talking to?"The mysterious robed man questioned?And then he saw the body down below.Just then, the thin slit in the mans head garb revealed eyes so wide they could swallow you whole.He knows who I am.The man unsheathed a twenty inch blade of silver as quick as a whip and drove it through Jason's chest.Blood pooled around him and the mysterious man wiped his katana and walked off.
