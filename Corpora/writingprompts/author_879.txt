I sat at my computer, my browser open on Reddit.In the top right corner, the New Personal Message indicator showed a single response.I swallowed, and hoped fervently that this would be the end of my woes.Two days prior, I had posted the following message:  

"Hi."I'm posting on r/SuperPowers because I figure it's the most likely place the person with the power to stop time will be likely to read it.My message to you, in short?"Quit it, jackass."So the first time I noticed time had stopped, I was a bit surprised.Then, I thought it was kind of neat.I mean, it's handy being able to cross the road in an instant without having to watch out for traffic.At least not *as much* as usual; it's always prudent to cross behind the vehicles in case they suddenly start moving again."But this crap starts to get annoying when you're half-way through a shower and you can't get all the shampoo out of your hair because the water stops flowing.Waving your head around in a bunch of suspended water-droplets simply doesn't cut it.Not to mention it's impossible to flush the turd that floats suspended in mid-air in the toilet bowl when time just happens to stop right after you drop a deuce."There's only so much time you want to stand around waiting for your order at McDonald's because you want a fresh Chicken Sandwich, and do you know what it's like to be stuck in an elevator with some slob who must have eaten nothing but beans and sauerkraut for week, whose farts sound like a moose in rut and smell like the same moose a week after it's been shot?It sucks.It *really* sucks."So, whoever you are, I'm asking you to quit it.It's getting old, fast.Now if there's a way that I can also be frozen in time along with everything else every time you use your powers, I'm open to that solution.But if not, if I'm stuck one more time having to wriggle out of my mother-in-law's unnaturally long embrace because you decide now is the perfect time to freeze time for whatever the hell you're doing, I'm going to lose my shit."Licking my lips, I clicked the icon.The message was short and to the point:  
"lol sux 2 b u".I cradled my head in my hands.Great.Just great.
