They burned the stars from the sky.They tore worlds asunder.The great plague of man spread from system to system grinding the Seven Celestial Empires into dust.All for one man, The Damon.The Korlanth found them on a backwater planet known as Earth.Foolish and headstrong as ever, their wisdom faltered against their never-ending quest for new slaves.Humans, they were called, were weak but clever.They bred fast and adapted well to almost every inch of their chaotic world.Had the Korlanth stopped for a moment, they would have realized those very traits would be their undoing.Our undoing.It was a matter of weeks but the humans were conquered.They didn't stay that way.Humans had an endless experience with war amongst themselves.They had a boundless imagination that we could never comprehend.They had hundreds of stories on how to deal with an alien oppressor; most far more insidious than we could ever be.Their leader, Damon, organized and defeated the Korlanth, casting off their oppressors as a Jharnar casts off its skin.Decimated, the Korlanth made a hasty retreat, abandoning much of their arms and ships, but stealing The Damon in spite.That was a mistake.The Humans learned.They adapted.They hunted.They fought.They spread.There are now but seven piles of ash to mark our graves.Humans.They burned the stars from the sky.They tore worlds asunder.And they got their Matt Damon back.
