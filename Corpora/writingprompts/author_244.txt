The past two years have been a haze for me.All I remember is that one day I could not see anymore.With as much speed as one suddenly blind can manage I sought out my husband for help, only to find out he could not see either.Quickly I learnt that it was not limited to us.My neighbours, the street, the whole city could not see.I remember that one day, with a bit of fumbling I used Bixby for the first time to get some news reports.There werent many, but those that were there all said the same thing.The world had gone blind.Whenever I had thought of an apocalypse, it involved either viruses and zombies or maybe meteorites, or perhaps a nuclear winter or us simply killing each other off.Yet it seemed the end of the world as we know it had come by something as seemingly innocuous as blindness.Because sure, as a software developer I knew all about accessibility and making sure our wonderful digital world was usable by blind people, yet we all knew it wasnt really.Even if it had just been the digital world that would have been fine, but our entire world was not made for blind humans.Although there were not many further news reports I just knew with a certainty that a whole species going blind at once must have cost hundreds of thousands of lives, if not more.Traffic deaths on the day itself, but many more in the days after as economies collapsed, food became a problem and eventually even water.I still lived in my home.I had gone out before but it was dangerous as the streets were covered with stuff that I couldnt even see.My husband was gone.I dont even remember when he left, just that hes gone.So is my food and my water.So is any desire I had to live in this blind world.I have nobody or nothing to live for.I didnt even think about it, but just used one of the chefs knives from the block on the kitchen counter and slit my wrists.I could do that much at least.I closed my eyes, which made no difference and waited.-

I opened my eyes slowly, like you do in the morning when its way too early to get up.My hands came up and I rubbed my eyes, then lay staring at the ceiling a moment.Something was different.Had I dreamt something?I sat up and thats when I noticed it for the first time.There was writing on my wall.*Dont Tell Them You Can See*.A shiver ran through me that had nothing to do with the open window.Yeah, thats not odd or anything.I couldnt eat at breakfast, where my husband and son were enjoying their toast.I felt nauseous.In the living room and in the kitchen all the walls had writing on them as well.*Dont Tell Them You Can See.* The letters danced before my eyes.Dont tell who?See what?I sipped my orange juice and felt like there was something I should remember.I looked at my husband and daughter having breakfast, but they seemed oblivious to the writing.I walked into the office after my lunch break and almost lost it.Everybody in their cubicles was working stoically on the next software patch.All of them clearly unable to see the words written on the walls all around them.At my desk I tried to work, but couldnt.Even on my computer screen the words kept getting repeated.I looked at my hands and saw they were shaking.Cold sweat glistened on my forehead and my heart was beating rapidly.What was happening?I ran down the street.The words haunting me everywhere.On the windows of stores selling electronics for entertainment, with graffiti on filthy walls, even on the side of dumpsters.And everybody around me just walked past blindly staring ahead.I stopped one of them and opened my mouth to say something.I gestured at the walls and dumpster across the street, Can you not s\~, but I stopped myself when his face turned to one of disgust and he pushed me away.I caught my reflection in a window and stopped.I looked like a crazy person.I walked closer to the window, my head slightly tilted and looked at myself more closely.My short brown hair was standing up in all directions and my eyes looked crazed, but thats not what caught my attention.My right eye was brown and my left was blue.I had two blue eyes didnt I?I glanced at my left hand and quietly counted.Five fingers.And a thumb.I whirled around and looked at the people mindlessly passing and suddenly laughed out loud.I was not crazy!I was still dreaming!A grin spread across my face.I did not often have a lucid dream, but oh the fun I could have.The world is my oyster!I blinked with my eyes and the masses in front of me all stopped walking and turned to the walls, finally seeing the writing on the wall.They started scrubbing them with just their hands until the message disappeared, then they smiled and walked off in pairs of twos and threes.I closed my eyes tightly again and when I opened them I was standing on a tropical beach and next to me a delicious looking guy with a wicked grin on his face.My lips curved upwards and I started walking towards him, but I stopped before I reached him.I frowned, hearing an odd beeping and I looked around me to see where it was coming from.Realisation hit me a moment later.No, no, nooo!!-

I groaned and almost punched the alarm clock next to me on the stand.Hoping against what I knew to be true, I raised my hand in front of my eyes and counted.It dropped heavily back on the bed as I looked at the walls around me.Clean.A mixture of emotions filled me as I remembered the odd dream.It was more like a nightmare now that I thought back on it.Both the thought of people being blind to something only you could see as living in a messed up world where everybody was blind.It wasnt all bad, though.Had I not dreamt I had a son?Or had it been a daughter?Either way I didnt have children, but that scene had been nice.It had also been nice when everybody had helped cleaning up and walked off.They had seemed happier, then.I heard noises in the kitchen and became aware of the smell of coffee.I got up then, with an odd kind of resolution that only ever came from dreams.In the kitchen I sat down and smiled at my husband as he handed me a cup of coffee.Thank you, love.You know I had this strange dream just now I said, and continued to tell him about it.I just think it was trying to tell me something, like what would happen if we just keep going like we always do.. I mused.He just shook his head.You know it sounds crazy when you tell it like that right?Just dont go telling your boss you want changes, next thing you know youll be fired.

I looked at him and realised what I had been telling him.Dreams were crazy in hindsight, especially without the emotions associated with them.There was no point in telling anyone what I had seen.If I wanted changes I would just have to show the people around me and make them happen myself.I smiled as I set down my empty coffee cup.I got up and walked over to my partners chair and stood behind him.Leaning down I brushed my lips over his cheek with a kiss, then over by his ear as my hands traveled from his shoulders down to his chest.I heard his sharp intake of breath and he stood still as I whispered softly, You know, youre right.Still, how about we practise for having those children anyway
