I've never done this before, so I'm not sure how much of this I can post at once.I'll break it up into parts.PART 1

I guess that it really started with a headache.I'd been working hard on a canvas for almost 18 hours straight, and I figured that it was just the mixture of concentration, junk food snacks, and probably not enough water that brought it on; it certainly wouldn't have been the first time.I crawled into bed and turned out the light, thankful that Samir's snoring wouldn't keep me awake, since he was on the night shift.I sprawled out over the cool sheets and drifted off.The next morning, I came to abruptly, pulled out of groggy half-conciousness by the continuing ache somewhere behind my eyes.I got out of bed, fixed myself some tea and toast, and popped a couple of painkillers.I hoped that the pain would just fade over the course of the day, but already there was a niggling worry in the back of my mind.Samir came home and we talked about his shift on the phones, and how my painting was going, engaging in our own private shift-change ritual, filling each other in on recent history as he prepared for sleep and I prepared for the day ahead.He soon noticed that something was off."Is there something wrong, babe?""Oh, it's just this headache.It...It started last night and I haven't shaken it yet.""Oh.Well, uh, it's probably nothing.You've been hitting the brushes pretty hard the last few days, right?"He continued without waiting for an answer, cracking a smile to lighten the mood, "You were on such a hot streak when I left yesterday that I'll bet you didn't eat properly or even get to sleep until after 2:00!"I agreed, but made a private decision to book an appointment with my clinic once Samir was asleep.There was no need to make him worry about my worry, and work ourselves down into a black spiral of mutual concern.And as it turns out, having wealthy patrons doesn't just get you the top-of-the-line splices, but you also get rushed to the front of the line when you call the doctor.The overly-kind assistant insisted that Dr. Hanson could squeeze me in at 1:30pm that day, and after a brief but losing battle of duelling politeness, I accepted.In those days, being a starving artist almost certainly also meant being a blind one, too.The Great Blinding had been only about two and a half years prior, and although low-quality replacement visual systems had become "affordable" for more than half the population, there were still plenty of folks who simply didn't have any way to scrape together the necessary cash.Support and services for the blind, which had been massively pumped up in the early months of the terrifying chaos, were nowadays returning to almost pre-Blinding levels.But despite how wonderful the mass media said everything was, with all of these medical and technological advances, there was a pretty large segment of society that was getting the shaft.Well, I guess that's nothing all that new.I remember how crazy those first days and weeks were.Fortunately, I had been awake when it happened, so I at least had a slim chance to react.I've heard stories from folks who were asleep, and suddenly jolted awake to find that not only were they inexplicably blind, but also caught in the middle of crashes, explosions, fires, or toxic spills and complete chaos, with no idea of what was going on or why they couldn't see anything.For people who were awake, at least everything was calm and normal right up until the moment that the blindness struck.For us, only the blindness was a total mystery.As time went on, even though no-one had ever planed for sudden, complete, global loss of vision, the people who'd managed to keep their cool remembered various contingency plans designed for other catastrophes, and adapted them to fit the situation.The initial death toll was incredible, but within a couple of months things were already starting to plateau.Between massive, pre-existing automation, reallocation of resources due to the state of emergency, already in-place disability assistance measures (so many OHS staff went overnight from being reviled as nitpickers to being lauded as prescient heroes!), and sadly, the huge death toll of those early days which reduced the pressure on resources, we were able to get back on our feet as a society pretty quickly, all things considered.Of course, once things calmed down, the first order of business was to try to figure out what had happened.Even today, no-one really has much of an idea about that.All sorts of theories have been bounced around, from more reasonable-sounding ones like an extreme burst of radiation from space, or previously unknown pathogens, to the tinfoil brigade ideas like aliens poisoning the water or the New World Order putting time-release chemical loads in vaccine shots.How it happened was still unknown, but what happened was clear.In the words of the most-used soundbite on the subject, it was "like a head injury without the head injury".Something had happened to everyone on Earth, simultaneously, which appeared to have damaged the optic processing centres of the brain just like a precisely-aimed blow to the head.Modern medical technology came to the rescue by giving us the option of replacing, or really, supplementing that part of the brain.Which was wonderful, but it didn't work properly for everyone.My uncle, who had managed to pull together enough funds to get a lower-end splice, had been so relieved to see again after he had the operation.But it was only a few months later that he started getting recurring headaches.Slight at first, but lasting for long periods, and getting worse over time, they ruined his life.They got so bad by the end that he was almost constantly delrious, alternately groaning with nausea and suffering bizarre hallucinations.Finally, the doctors determined that he was an early case of splice rejection.His case was too far gone to be treated with what was available at the time, but they were able to safely remove his splice.He's stuck with blindness for the rest of his life, and he's on a complicated regime of medications that have left him a mumbling, shambling shadow of who he used to be.That's why I was so worried about this headache, and Samir knew that.It's exactly how it started with my uncle.It seemed likely that splice rejection was hereditary, so the odds were good that I could develop it as well.I kissed Samir "good night", and got in the shower.It was only 10am, but the headache and its associated anxiety had completely robbed me of any creative momentum that I had had the night before, so I thought that I'd head downtown and take a long and leisurely brunch to relax and reflect, before going to the specialist's appointment.I was sitting at the bus stop, skimming my newsfeeds, when I was suddenly overcome with a wave of nausea.It was a good thing that I'd only eaten lightly that morning, or I probably wouldn't have been able to keep it down.The sickness was very brief, and started to subside almost the moment that I closed my eyes.In between deep breaths, I looked up and caught the concerned eye of a nearby municipal worker, who was repairing some minor cracks in the sidewalk."You okay, buddy?""Oh, uh, yeah, I think so.Sorry.I think I must've eaten something that disagreed with me."I smiled wanly.He returned my smile good-naturedly; "Yeah?Or maybe drank something last night?""Ha ha, could be, could be."Inside, I was panicing.It really might have been food poisoning.Or it might be splice rejection, coming on faster than I'd ever heard about before.During the bus ride, I had another small episode, maybe set off by a noisy roadworks crew that the bus was stuck next to for several minutes.I got to my favorite little cafe on the bay, but even there the awful feeling hit me again, just looking out over the water toward the bridge.With my appetite and mood both completely ruined, I walked over the to huge state library down the street and hid in a cool, dark reading nook until it was time to go to my appointment.
