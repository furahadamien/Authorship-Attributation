ThrowOutAQuestion
My parents were the sort of people who bought me a welcome mat as a house warming gift when I finally struck it out on my own.Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against welcome mats, they're fine.They're the sort of thing that you don't buy when you first move into a new place.So, it's not like I had one already.But, it wasn't really something I particularly wanted, or even cared about having.My parents had no idea, or didn't really care, what I might actually want.They just wanted to give off the impression that they're nice people who do nice things, just as long as it didn't require any work.So buying me a house-warming gift was part of standard protocol, even if it was something I didn't particularly care for.I looked at it after I unwrapped it, it was so generic.It didn't even reflect anything about my style or interests.Just a gray mat with the word "Welcome" on it.I tried my best to smile and thank my parents, "Oh, thank you.I didn't have one of these already."My mom smiled back at me, "Now we can come and visit you any time we want."I looked back at her, puzzled.My dad answered my puzzled expression, "... because it says 'Welcome'."*Yes, very funny, dad.*

I thanked them again as their visit grew towards an end, and ushered them out.As we walked out the door together, I set the mat outside the door.I was glad I wouldn't be seeing them again for a while, but on the off-chance they would come to visit me, I wanted them to see I was using their gift.But, I didn't get the once-in-a-while visits I was hoping for.They kept finding excuses to come and visit me.They wanted to make sure my fire alarms were in working order, or that my sink wasn't leaking, or that my shower floor wasn't too slippery.They wanted to come over to tell me about the latest crazy gossip they heard.They would complain about drama-filled lives, or complain that I wasn't calling them often enough.It just got more and more frequent the longer I lived away from home.They even started coming around at odd hours of the night.Finally, one time I came home, and my mom was there adjusting the furniture.I stared at her in disbelief, in front of the still-open door, as she nattered something about how I should really not have the TV across from the window."... you would get a much better picture without all that glare..." 

"Mom," I said as I continued staring.I honestly didn't even know how she got in."What are you doing here?"She stared back at me, with hurt eyes."What?Is your own mother not allowed to visit?I didn't realize I wasn't welcome here."Then she started to cry.I immediately reacted by consoling her, "No, you're fine mom.Of course you're allowed to visit."Her tears instantly vanished, and she went back to rearranging my furniture.I walked back out the door enraged.As I walked out fuming, I thought about what vampires my parents were.Then, I saw that stupid welcome mat still sitting there.I kicked it in frustration.But, after I kicked it, I saw something gold sticking out from underneath it.Under my welcome mat, there was a key.
