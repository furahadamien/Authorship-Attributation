I could hardly breath."What is this?"I muttered to the guard detail with me."I don't know, sir.I suggest we take it the FBI, and they will deal with it."He responded cooly.I hated that idea.I wasn't the president anymore, I want to be able to live a little.But I knew it wasn't a suggestion, it was a command.But my curiosity was too great.I took a picture of the number quickly, hopefully without someone noticing, and I gave it to the agent.He took it, and nodded promptly.I darted for the living room, alone, and called the number.I waited, and I waited, but it kept ringing.I was getting anxious and I was almost sure this whole thing was a joke.But...then something picked up."Hello, sir."It was muffled, sort of distant, and quite ominous.I was tempted to hang up.I have a family, I can't be meddling in danger."...um."I said, I was to scared to think properly."Listen, I know this is a bit of a shock to you, I mean honestly, you've seen the clip I'm sure, that bullet went right through my head!But trust me Barack, the world is more complicated than it seemed."Whoever...whatever that was almost laughed saying that.It sort of reassured me, maybe this is the real JFK."Okay Barack, nothing jibber jabber, you're a busy man, I would know.Hah!Anyways, I want you to meet me at that airport named after me, you'll know where to go when you get there.I expect to see you there by noon.See you soon ol' pal!"*Click*

That was it, he hung up.I was in a nervous sweat.I didn't know what to do.As far as I knew, this was a terrorist.But that voice sounded EXACTLY like JFK.And against everything I ever knew.Without consulting my wife, my kids, my security detail, I packed my bags.This better be JFK.
