Green had led me everywhere, it led me to sit in on meetings with billionaires, to network with top politicians...I even rang the bell at the stock exchange.Money was never an issue, green had let me to the right financial planner, to the right CPA, it even led me to the right hedge fund which **made** me money during the financial crisis.But there were times where I saw glimpses of red.The lines would intersect - like the time I shook hands with the sketchy oil businessman in the Middle East or the time I decided to speed away after hitting that guys car.The way I understood it - green was just money, clean money.And that's all I needed in life.Until I got bored.Green was too easy.The lines didn't cross anymore.I was too good at this and missed the thrill, the exhilaration.So one day I decided to take a leave and vacation on the red line.See what my life could be like.Another terrible mistake....I didn't know where to look.So I called my local governor.Shaking his hand was at a green-red intersection once.I asked him to drinks and he happily accepted.He pulled up in a fancy sports car, and I noticed... the lines didn't intersect.Green was far gone.It was only red.I was nervous but decided to get in the car.The governor asked me where I wanted to go.And I shrugged and said wherever you normally go.He looked at me strangely and said 'everything all right bud?'.I said 'yeah why do you ask?'.He responded 'well you know who my friends are.I figured we were going to a classy joint'.I said 'no I thought I'd try something new' - what a stupid response on my part..He smiled, stomped on the accelerator and pulled into an isolated restaurant.We walked to the basement, went through a curtain, then a kitchen, then down into a cellar.The green light was still no where to be seen.Just red...
 
What I saw blew my mind.There were about 30 people, wearing nice clothes, surrounding a ring.They were all men, yelling and drunk.A stunning lady wearing close to nothing came up to us, took our coats and offered us glasses of whisky.She spoke 'welcome Walter' and winked at me.The crowd erupted when they saw the governor.Walt!!!Let's go!Get over her you sunofabitch you...I walked over and the yelling made sense now.It was a fighting ring.The men were cheering... most of them I recognized and it wasn't surprising: guys with old money, CEOs, a few more politicians and just some guys in the country clubs I didn't care about.But there were a few I didn't know.One in specific and the red line was leading straight to him.I walked towards him; as the boring people rushed to shake my hands and embrace me.He stood up reflexively and spoke, with a Russian accent.'Mr Roth' I presume.Yes I said, and you?'Igor', I go by Igor.Walter, the governor came over and made the proper introduction.He said Igor organizes this club and guarantees our anonymity.Walt asked him to give the tour to me.Igor nodded and began walking me around.He showed me the main area, where they imported the best fighters around the world for 'the clubs' entertainment.He took me to the hallway and showed me the individual rooms with the finest drugs, imported women, and all the other things you can imagine.But the line led to a door that was closed.I tried turning the knob and he said 'sir, I have to apologize, that is for our platinum members only'.I needed to see it.So I asked, how much for platinum?He smiled, and said 'you can't buy platinum.Not even the president is platinum.'You will be approached when you're ready.So I pulled my checkbook out, wrote a check for 20 million dollars and told him 'let me fucking in' 

His eyes popped - they always do.And he nodded and said yes sir...

Then he opened the door and said, best of luck sir.20 years later.I finally saw the green line again.It had been a while.I was coming out of prison and the red line went left with the bus leaving prison.The green line went right to the pay phone.There weren't any green lines in maximum security prison.Red all over... and damn did I rule it.I'm glad I still had good friends who fought for my cause.But I don't know that I can call them good anymore.I don't know that I could call myself good...

Stay on the green lines my friend...
