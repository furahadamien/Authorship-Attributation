I called my mother."Hey son, it's good to hear your voice!""You too, Merry Christmas.Did you guys get Vinnie that drum set?"Tears in my eyes just to talk to her."Sure did, thanks to Uncle Walker!"There's no sadness in her voice.Just joy to be with her grandson, my nephew."Sorry I couldn't make it out there, first few checks have been playing catch up.It's tough in a new city, don't know anyone.""That's ok johnny boy it's just good to hear your voice.I love you so much, you're such a good man."I can always tell she really means it.The chemo hasn't changed her at all."I love you mom.I'll be down to visit soon.Take care of yourself for me, and tell Vinnie I said hi."Tears always swell when I talk or think about her.Stage IV but this won't be our last year, not if we can help it.
