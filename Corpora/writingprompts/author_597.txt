Clack.Clack clack clack.The drumming of fingers on keyboards was deafening.Clack clack.The sound pierced the air 

Clack.The sound, cutting through conversation, punctuating half sentences, ruining stories from the night before.Clack clack clack.With each passing chatter of the keyboards, the vein on the side of Syd's head began to swell and pulsate.He hated this life.He hated his job.He hated his girlfriend.He hated the whole sorry lot.Clack.The clacking was getting to be more than he could bear.how did he end up in this sorry state?The more he tried to remember, the less he could.He swore to himself that life had more to offer than the office.But it would appear he was wrong.Clack clack.His breathing started to hasten.The frustration growing.He tightened his fists ready to erupt.Ping.Ping was a different sound.Ping was an email.Ping was contact from the outside world, from somewhere other than the cage he called work.He clicked it.Click.Suddenly the room fell silent.His breathing all but stopped and his eyes grew wide all while a smile curled on his lips.He knew it!He knew there was more to life than this."YOU ARE NOT SYDNEY HARBOUR"

The email had an attachment.Click.His eyes traced the lines across the screen his grin growing more sick and twisted with each line passed."The Human Nuke levels financial building" lead to "He dropped workers from roof after they begged" before finally arriving at "ultimately he was stopped by the mindfreak but the damage was done"

Underneath the article was a picture clear as day with syndey's face contorted in to a maniacal grin atop the recently levelled building.He couldn't remember but he knew the picture was real.He could feel it in the very depths of himself.Clack.Syd's eyes snapped shut and the world around him crumbled.There was no more office, no more co workers and no more clacking.All that remained was the smouldering embers and a phoenix rising from the ashes.
