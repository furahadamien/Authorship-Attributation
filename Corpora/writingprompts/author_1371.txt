"Shit, shit, shit, shit!"I thought to myself half caughing half barfing up another hunk of greenish blood.I knew I had done it this time kah'lorn, the substance I was on, was extremely addicting and I had been on it for what felt like an eternity.They say once your hooked its only a matter of time before you overdose; well it looked like my time.My stomach spasamed painfully as my vision blurred, corrected itself, and burst into colours.It was becoming more and more difficult to concentrate.I slumped against the wall next to the toilet, exhaled heavily, and slid to the ground.I leaned back my head against the wall looking at the single unblinking light on the cealing.I finally accepted it, I was going to die.I was going to die lonely, miserable, and alone.Thoughts of my parents sobbing over my body flooded my mind, a single tear rolled down my face.I had never meant for it to go this far.I drew in one final breath just as the kah'lorn was peaking.As I exhaled, I felt my consciousness get wripped from its housing.I was even more confused, I felt my conciousness unlock memories that made no sense.I felt like I was living two lives, that I had always been livong two lives.I felt like I was the universe.I watched sacred geometry dance before my eyes, unimaginable architecture tower around me, and endless oceans flow below me.Then I gasped in a huge breath, my throat burned like I had held my breath for an hour.My eyes snapped open on a strange scene.I was on a porch of some kind.The trees around this strange house were brown and green instead of the typical blue and silver.There was alot of green everywhere.The sky was blue instead of purple.There was a strange beker shaped aperatus in my hand.A voice came from behind me,  welcome back, how was the trip.My stomach dropped out from under me as I realized that though my realities had changed, the person I was stayed the same.
