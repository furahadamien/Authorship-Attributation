Diablo165
All of us saw the bizarre irony of the situation.The luckiest people on the planet, all confined to a maximum security prison in a highly classified location.We called it The Institute.Luckily (heh), it wasn't a standard prison.We were confined because our luck potential made even interacting with us fundamentally unfair.People with lower ratings simply COULD NOT compete with us.Scrabble?Every set of tiles was a Bingo.Uno?All Wildcards and Draw Two's.Goldeneye?Guess who spawns at right by the Rocket launcher and body armor.That's right.Us.EVERY.TIME.Any game that relied on random chance was automatically in our favor.Even contests of skill were skewed.See, our good luck doesn't improve our skills....but it DOES make our opponents more prone to maladies.My roommate has the unfortunate distinction of beating Olympic gold-medalist in a footrace.Easily.Sure, she took WAY longer than the Olympian would have, but the Olympian just so happened to take a nasty fall right out of the gate.It ended his career, and when no one could see ANY reason for him to have fallen where, when, and how he did...people began to suspect foul play.This was back when we were just getting the hang of stat identification.WAY before we truly understood the societal implications.If we even understand them now.People just weren't willing to accept a life where they were totally inferior to a select group of people just because a genetic quirk made those folks extremely lucky.Once the scanners were invented, people with maxed out luck ratings could be easily found, sequestered, and confined.We were all in there together.Men, women, children...old people..didn't matter.If you've got a max luck rating, you stay here.It's not bad by any stretch.Very few of us are criminals, and the ones who are got that way because they were spoiled by their ratings...if you spent your entire life getting away with EVERYTHING, why wouldn't you?So, the aim of the place was rehabilitation, comfort, and protection.I've been to resorts that were crap by comparison.The food is awesome, the amenities are incredible, and no one's been shanked, shivved, or any of that.You'd think that we were here so the rest of the world could be protected from us.You'd be wrong.Like I said, people have this really interesting thing with fairness.They know life isn't fair, but when faced with that reality embodied in a person they simply CANNOT outclass, things turn nasty.And when you attack someone with a max luck rating...you're going to end up hurt.The guy down the hall?He came from a rural town where people had begun to suspect his luck rating was too high when all their attempts at hate crimes ended in serious injury or death to the perpetrators.Of course, they didn't learn.A mob formed overnight, went to his house, and attempted to burn it and him with it.He woke up the next morning, refreshed, with a veritable sea of smouldering rednecks on his lawn.He actually called The Institute and requested a scan.Sure, he picked a bad spot to settle down, but he wasn't stupid.He had begun to suspect too.So we're here to learn how to function in a society of equals, and we're here because if we weren't, humanity might wipe itself out trying to exterminate us.It's interesting seeing what this sort of advantage can do to a person.See, if you put us all together, we're all equals.This is as close to "normal" life as any of us is going to get.Kids took to it the easiest.They didn't grow up just beating everyone in everything...or they didn't have enough time outside to get used to it.They socialized pretty easily.Teenagers and adults took it harder.You spend your formative years incapable of losing or suffering consequences, and it'll alter your perspective.They eventually adjust, but for awhile, they behave like raging narcissists.Old folks took it the hardest.You try spending 50+ years OWNING life, only to be told that your accomplishments were due to nearly illegal levels of luck, and your entire self-image falls apart.There's The One Guy who actually lucked into a bunch of cash, a tv show, and a pretty high political office.For the longest time, people thought we'd fallen into an alternate reality.But once the scanners were invented, some mope got a pocket-version and ran it on The One Guy during a rally.He managed to get close enough to use the scanner before getting gunned down, but the **100** readout was clearly visible to everyone in the room and tuned in.The One Guy was collected and sent here pretty much immediately.The guy with the scanner went in the books as a hero to the world.I'm sure he'd be jazzed had he lived.I kind of wish he'd had a higher luck rating.Even getting that close to The One Guy was an accomplishment.Unfortunately, he didn't have a high enough score to survive the experience.But we're all grateful for his sacrifice.So all of a sudden, an entire countrys  political system was in disarray, and the world understood just how broad the implications of the ratings could be.You take someone with a high enough luck rating and a low enough intelligence or empathy score, and this person could legitimately end the world.And the sad fact is, if left unchecked, a high luck rating over a long enough period of time will absolutely erode your other skills.When you rely on luck, all your other skills, like kindness, compassion, intelligence tend to atrophy.I guess we're lucky we caught The One Guy in time.He was doing well, but he was fucking things up pretty badly for everyone else.We started debating how many historical figures may have had max luck ratings.Alexander The Great?Hitler?Overnight, scans went from being used in suspicious situations to being globally mandated.And the folks who scored too high got sent here.Anyway, we thought our luck had run out, having been ripped away from our families, friends, and lives.But it wasn't bad.In fact, it was the best place for us.A few months ago, isolated cases of a new disease started popping up.First in Latin America, then the U.S., then Europe.With global travel being as widespread as it is, most of the people on the planet are dead or dying.Except us.We lucked out.
