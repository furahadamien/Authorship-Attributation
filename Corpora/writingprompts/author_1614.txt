The despair he felt in his gut was overwhelming.Every sinew, every part of his being, ached with the torment of his knowledge; the knowledge that he would never see HER again, never hear the laughter of HER again, nor feel the touch of HER again.The dream, or was it a dream?He couldnt bring himself to ask his own brain to process what was real and what was not.Was he dead, and this is his personal afterlife?Was he such a bad person before, that the torment of being here alone, with the knowledge of HER, was his punishment.Surely not, surely there was a more rational explanation for this?He could not see it.Everything felt just as real as before, but THAT was the problem.Before he could work out which way was what, he was falling.As his head was thrown back his eyes focused on the ceiling of... forest?Yes, a forest, it must have been.Rays of sunlight pierced the dense foliage as if his new afterlife God was trying to skewer him mid-air.How beautiful it was, the sky, where he saw a brief parting of the leaves; a strikingly vibrant red that seemed to shimmer mysteriously, almost as if the secrets to life itself lay within.Then, it was over, he lay motionless on the ground, the fall was too great for his new body to handle.His eyes flickered, drank in as much of the pink sunlight as they possibly could, and closed.Suddenly he woke, and it was indeed all a dream.However, another realisation hit him like a brick wall.He HAS lost HER.And there is simply nothing to be done about it.
