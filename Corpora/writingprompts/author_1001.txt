"He did what?"I snarled at my young and frightened secretary who stood ashen in my office doorway after delivering the news that my former bodyguard stole 10$ from me, calling it an "obligatory parting gift."The nerve of this man.Well, I was going to use my resources to hunt him down.Jon Mikel would soon learn to never fuck with a boss who sells weapons.I dismiss the secretary and remove the ugly painting from behind my desk, revealing a wall safe.I open the safe and remove an expensive satellite phone.I punch in the only contact saved on the phone and raise the phone to my ear "I have a new target."On the other end of the line I hear a soothing deep voice reply "Understood."I knew one of the highest paid assassins in the world would see Jon get the justice he so rightfully deserved.Two days later I turn on the news to see the attractive blond reporter describing what happened at a scene of a car bombing.She was talking when I tuned in saying "Yes Michael, so it seemed that out of nowhere Mr. Mikel's car exploded, showering $40,000 dollars worth of 10$ bills all over Nike St as well as a haunting note, saying "Remember kids, it's not nice to steal."I turn away from the T.V.smiling as I head to the computer room to search Reddit for a highly qualified bodyguard, proficient in both protection and memes.
