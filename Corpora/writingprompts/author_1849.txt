I was *born* with max luck, being told my whole life that I shouldnt be, that I was *favored*.Nope, I was locked up and the key thrown away.I had spent my life, from age thirteen onwards here.My Luck was my weapon, but I wasnt sure how.I *should have* been able to get out of here, press my own Luck to its maximum and escape.I was only allowed to talk to my guards, who were, to be honest, all very nice and fairly handsome, but hovering around fifty.Gradually, I found out that we, the prisoners that is, are all ninety and higher, seriously.Were all treated like pariahs for something outside of our control and then isolated.I was one of the lucky ones, the guards liked me and treated me like a younger brother, all except Chuck, but he was taken away.I liked him the best.I was nineteen when Chuck was taken away.He waited and didnt touch me until I was eighteen and then one day, he had vanished.It broke my heart.Kyle told me what had happened, a relationship with a Lucky could increase Luck over time.I had done it to both of us, apparently, he was pushed to one hundred, like the maximum security ward.*I had gotten Chuck locked up.*

My resolve hardened.I would have him back.Chuck was *mine*.I became quiet, acting broken.I wasnt.I started doing research.If I increased my Luck beyond one hundred, I would *transform*, becoming my true self, probably either an angel or demon.I couldnt wait.I would have Chuck back.I did more research, I had devoured what little I could, then began bribing the guards to bring me more.I did things I shouldnt have been proud of, but my body was a small price to pray to have Chuck indefinitely, for our eternity.I discovered more, like the lineage of Lucifer, how he had six (SIX?!)sisters; two sets of triplets.Destiny, Fortuna, and *Luck*; the other sisters, while interesting, werent relevant to me or my search (Rose, Daisy, and Lily).I started gathering myself and my materials I would need, incense, flowers, dice, cards, sundry items that soon filled my cell.I laughed and started that night.It was a full moon, a hot day in summer, our air conditioning broke down; sweat dripped down my face as I completed the ritual with a slice of my own flesh, blood splattering the flowers, the petals scattering in a sudden wind.A second? my own mother stood in my cell.Oh Liam, she said as I rushed to her, enveloping her soft body in a hug.What did they do to you?

I am too *Lucky*, I was locked up and my Fated stolen from me, I tried to be strong, but tears poured out of my eyes as the story poured out of my mouth.Mother, I beseech you, please help me.

And she did.
