You were never supposed to be nervous for test day they said.Everyone is naturally better at certain things, and everyone is happier doing what they natuarlly excel in, they also said.It was also said that the occasional person would score low in every category.It was a common childhood insult to be told you'd fail the test and be taken to the dumb house.In reality it wasn't called the dumb house but The Home for the Differently Abled was not a name that rolled off the tounge.They were all wrong.My older sister had scored extremely high in Logic, Communication, and Abstraction, she was quickly accepted into the advanced sciences program at The College.Her roommate had scored a perfect 100 in both Logic and Detail.I was hoping to get into engineering track.I had always enjoyed building and fixing things, and I didn't think I'd have any trouble.Everything I built or fixed worked OK, and I could even keep up with my genius sisters riddles and tricks.The format of the test was all wrong.Teenagers having to check all thier personal electronics, waiting in long lines, then being isolated for the test.The whole thing bred a general air of nervousness.I could see graduates out the window running to meet thier families.My turn came and I entered my assigned testing room.It appeared to be a standard assesment test.If your life direction is based on a single test at least the schools did a good job preparing you.They whole test took about an hour by the time I had submitted my answers.I was met in the hallway by the schools guidance councilor.He wasnt alone.I was taken to The Home for the Differently Abled.To be honest, it was a pleasant place.The food was good, the other people interned with me were good for conversation, and the grounds were generally comfortable and beautiful.Asside from the guards and distant but obvious walls.No electronics were allowed, but there were plenty of books, games, crafts, and everyone assisted in general chores and maintenance of the facility to pass time.I had frequent conversations regarding what I considered to be unlawful detention.Most of the other detainees would laugh, some considered me crazy, and it didnt seem anyone paid any attention.So I decided to escape.I knew the windows and doors would be monitored, and any absences at meals or after curfew would be immediately investigated.I secretly switched job tags with the guy next to me at lunch and found myself working on regrading the road near the main gate.I knew better than to make a break for it, but I did not return with the others.I stayed away from the walls and managed to avoid capture for 2 days by digging holes just large enough for myself to crouch in under heavy overhanging brush.On the third day there were other inmates joining the search.I was able to blend in and managed to steal a guards keycard before I was caught.I dont remeber what happened, but I woke up in an office with armed guards close by."I am your administrator."The man at the desk stood and approached me, stopping and leaning on the near side."I understand you're not happy here."I said nothing."You're not being punished.We know our security can cause feelings of isolation in spite of our efforts to hide it.This is a safe place."I did not trust him, but there are ways to learn things without getting direct answers so I spoke up."I want to see my test scores".The administrator stared at me, clearly not expecting the question.This told me he had not been asked before, and I grew more bold by his hesitation."I was sent here in error, get my test and you'll see.""Who do you think we bring here?"he asked.I resumed my silence."This man," he gestured to one of the guards "scored 100 in Security, and Luck" Luck is a category on the test?I had never seen that on the lists, and took it for a bluff.The administrator continued "the other guard scored 100 on security, 100 on Strategy, and 100 on Luck.I personally scored 100 in Administration, 95 in Detail,and 100 in Luck.""Let me see my test scores."I tried to be forceful about it, but was honestly put off that what would probably be the best guards in the world were watching me right now.To my suprise, he lifted a folder from the desk and handed it to me.I was nervous all over again as I opened it.There was a category for Luck.I had scored 100 in that,Abstraction, Detail, Logic, Mechanics, and Strategy."If this is true, how did you catch me?""We shot tranquilizers at everyone standing.We'd never have caught you awake, or by any action that singled you out."Smart."Is everyone here like this?""Not like us in this room.100s are rare, and multiple 100s even more so.But everyone here has a luck score of 100.Luck is a strange category: scores on Luck range between 1 and 75, then jump to 100.We think that after 75 the Luck skill influences its own score.Leaving people like that in the public leads to corruption of all levels of governance, afterall why would you act in the best interest of others if you did not experience any consequences for acting in your own interests?""I won't stay.I don't care what you think about society, I have a right to freedom!I'll find a way!""I said 'not like us in this room'.That includes you.The initial confinement with the population of our resort is a further test of sorts.It is a test of Ambition, and you have set a new high score!You are now going to join an elite level of scociety - you are the best of the best, and we would like to invite you to join us in running our Home for the Differently Abled, and directing the top levels of our government!"
