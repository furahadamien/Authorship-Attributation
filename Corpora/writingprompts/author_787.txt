A knurled, ancient oak table sat in the center of a solid white room with no windows or doors; it was a little box of nowhere that the Seven Deadly Sins used to discuss important issues in times of dire need.The last time they gathered was to discuss whether or not Barack Obama was *actually* the Anti-Christ or not, because Envy was pretty paranoid that the big guys were making moves a little early.Thankfully, it turned out that he was just black.Fucking stupid humans and their false alarms.The most recent time, however, the meeting had been called by...well, everyone--except for Pride.The other six had contacted her, saying a discussion needed to take place, and Pride warily accepted.She'd done well not to interfere with more than a hundred human lives that year, and had been regularly watching YouTube videos on how to live a humble life.Admittedly, she thought she was better than the guy giving the lectures and quit watching, but it's the thought that counts.Gluttony, Lust, Wrath, Envy and Greed sat at the table, hands folded, quiet eyes avoiding Pride, whose gaze danced around the room, looking for someone to give her an indication of what was going on.She was feeling an itch of anxiety in the back of her mind, the seed of worry sprouting; had they finally decided to try and take her out?After all, she was *clearly* the strongest and most important Sin.Obviously."So," Pride said, clearing her throat, tapping the table."Can we just get started already?Seriously, I get the whole 'all or nothing' rule, but she's taking even longer than usual, and it's not like he has anything to offer in these meetings.""**Shut the fuck up**," a deep, dark voice, like the crack of ash-colored thunderstorm clouds, crashed over them."**I hate you, Pride, you maggot.But I also agree we should stop waiting for that goddamn, slow-as-fuck sack of shit.I don't have any fucking patience left for this.Let's just kill the bitch.**"

Pride sighed, wagging a finger."Now, now, Wrath.Let's remember our table manners.Besides, I wouldn't want you to get hurt fighting the strongest Sin just because you're blind.""**Fuck you and your entire family.I'm going to rip your skull out and fuck it right here, on the table.**"

Lust perked up, a smile slithering across his face, and Pride groaned."God, Lust, have some self-respect.And Wrath--I *am* your family, you idiot.Why are all of the Sins so stupid?Honestly.""Calm down, Wrath," Greed said, his voice like two pennies rubbing together."Save it for when we make a decision, then you can murder her and whatever else you two freaks have planned.I don't care, but we're going to make sure we get what she has first."Pride rolled her eyes."Look, guys, I know I'm the greatest of the sins, but you can't take that from me.Even if you pool together and kill me, you'll still all be every bit as inferior as you are now."Envy smashed her hands on the table, standing up."Quit lying, you bitch!We know you've been working behind our backs, interfering with the human world!We want what you have!"Pride knitted her brows."Wait, what?What are you talking about?""Don't play stupid," Greed said."We know they're throwing a celebration for you right now.It's literally called the 'Pride Parade', and they all get real dressed up in bright colors, making themselves the center of attention, which is your favorite thing in the world to do.So don't even try and pretend this isn't your work.We want a cut of what's going on here.How are you so involved without completely spiraling the world's balance off and...you know, pissing Dad off?""I literally have no idea what you're talking about.But, honestly, this just proves my point.I haven't done any interference, and I didn't do anything to set that up.They just know I'm the best and they're celebrating me, what can I say?Get good, you fucking losers."A portal of light fizzled and popped, and a ragged woman fell from it, splatting against the floor like a sack of potatoes."Ah, how great of you to finally join us," Greed said."Now, be a dear and make it to the table before we adjourn, if you can.""**You dumb bitch.You're ten feet away from us.Just get the fuck up and sit at the fucking table you useless god-turd.Mom must've shit you out on accident.**"

Sloth yawned, her hand moving at a snail's pace, and the group sighed.Gluttony finally looked up from his meal, face covered in bits of food and gruel, looking like the disgusting animal he was."I want a parade with FOOD, FOOD, SO MUCH FOOD, EVERYBODY EAT AND NEVER STOP EATING AND--"

"**You fat piece of shit, don't get started with that or I'm going to drown you in your fucking cereal.**"

The giant went back to his food, nearly drowning himself in it instead, and pride groaned.She'd always found Gluttony to be repulsive."Just tell us, you bitch," Envy said, crying, arms crossed."Just fucking tell us!It's not hard!Stop being a meanie, I WANT IT!"Pride rubbed her temples--family gatherings are always such a fucking mess."Seriously, guys, I didn't do this myself.If they want to celebrate me because I'm awesome, I can't control it.Stop blaming me and blame yourselves for not being worth it.""**I'll fucking paint these walls with you if you don't quit flapping that mouth, and then we'll see who's the best Sin.**"

Greed opened a little viewport in the center of the table for everyone to look into.As they peered in, they watched the crowd of bright colors and rainbow flags, of men and women defying the norm their father had set in order to do whatever their hearts desired.Men embracing men, women kissing other women, all wearing smiles and standing tall in front of the rest of the world."You guys think this is a parade *I* set up?"Pride asked, face contorting."**Why are the boys kissing?Oh...oh no.I don't want it anymore.**"

Lust giggled, leaning over to him, and he fled from a hand wandering his way."What's the matter, you big, scary man?All that talk and a little fun sends you running?Look at them...yes, I need this.I want to be there.Take me there right now, Pride."But Pride was confused, staring into the viewport.It was clearly not about her, because if anything, it had the look and feel of something Lust would create for fun.She kept watching them, standing tall before the scorning eyes, disobeying the rules humans before them had tried to set, letting their true selves show without an ounce of shame for it.They were strong, and true, and...Proud.She smiled as she looked into the porthole--ignoring Wrath's screams, Sloth's yawning corpse inching closer, and Lust starting to make some uncomfortable motions with his hands--and felt pride, just once, for something other than herself.---

"Crikey!"Steve was crouched low in a barren tundra of cracked clay redder than a low flame.It formed an almost hexagonal pattern and flaked like fresh biscuits."Now *that's* a rare treat.Look at 'im!"A beast, reminiscent of a man yet gnarled and burnt with eyes like hearths gnawed on bone in the distance."Let's get a closer look, shall we?"he asked rhetorically, already in motion toward it.The beast was, in all effects, a demon, yet Steve did not falter.He never did."Now, some of you may be wondering- aren't you scared?The answer is easy.No, mate.I wasn't scared up there, and I sure won't be down under."Closer he stalked, hands against the scorched ground, until he came close enough to make out the pupils of the beasts eyes."Well isn't this a treat?I know that one.Ingrid Newkirk, former head of PETA.I'd recognize that face anywhere."He smiled at first, but it quickly twisted."I know a lot of folks back home might like this.You can see the poor thing is in pain."I just want to tell you all back home that there's no joy in suffering.It's a tough one, I know.Crocodiles are easy.They try to kill and eat you.People are harder.Sometimes they pretend to be your friend first.But either way, we all need to do our best to show love."It's time for me to get going, now.The big man upstairs doesn't like me gone long.G'day, mates."--------

When I was told my team would be the first to land on Mars, excitement welled within me.'Pioneers', they called us; and really, how many people can call themselves pioneers?It's exciting.It's scary.It's... unlike anything else.And yet, as I stood and looked across an expanse of nothing but reddish brown sand and dust, I felt absolutely nothing but disappointment.The voyage was hell, and I'd spent *so long* looking forward to landing that the reality of Mars just couldn't live up to what I'd been expecting.The first three days were mind-numbingly boring and dreary.The fourth day changed everything."What... the *hell* is that?"I asked through the comm system, pointing at a torn-up tent in the distance."Did one of you assholes set that up to screw with me?""I wish I were that creative, believe me," Stan responded, staring alongside me."But that... that's not us.There's a flag, Mike.I can't make it out from here."The two of us, along with Victor Foreman, our engineer, pressed forward with caution.As we approached, the flag became increasingly visible: plain red, with a yellow hammer and sickle.It was tattered and coated in dust."Okay, this is bullshit.O'Neill, are you fucking with us?I remember seeing this flag in history class."A response came over the radio."This is a bit too... complex for my sense of humor.I'm a simple man, Mike.I don't recognize the flag, what is it?""Come on, man.Sleep through class?""Sorry, I was busy learning how to pilot for NASA.This isn't funny, Mike.If you've seriously found something, we have to treat this situation with urgency and caution."I sighed into the mic."Soviet Russia.The one we got into the Cold War with, way back when.""I'm going to contact HQ.Proceed as if there could be people in that base.""Oh, come on, Cap-"


"I know we get cozy, but right now, we're not friends."I choked back my pride."Understood.Stay by the feeds, we're heading in.I'm telling you, though, there's no one here anymore.Everything's... just- it's destroyed.Ripped to shreds."I stepped forward, pushing aside a fold of fabric from the tent wall.Immediately, I recoiled, sucking my breath in.Right there, on a cafeteria bench, was a man- his skin pale, spotted with black and brown, but nearly perfectly mummified overall.He looked like he'd died just a week prior."Holy shit."Victor threw up in his suit, then tried to paw at his slimy helmet."Cap, I don't think this is a joke.You see this, right?""Already contacting Houston.Someone's going to have to reach out and see if there's something we don't know about.Does he look injured?"I kept myself at a distance, scanning his body with my eyes.There were still packets of food on a nearby counter."No.Honestly, it looks like he just suffocated.He didn't starve, and there's no blood or any kind of wound."There was a large, clunky device on the table in front of the body.I reached out and grabbed it, keeping my eyes off the corpse."I think it's a recording device."There were batteries in it, still looking fresh.Oxygen's a real asshole when it comes to preservation.I flipped a window out on the lefthand side, and turned it on.After rewinding for several seconds, a man appeared on screen- I immediately recognized him.I slipped my suit's 3.5mm jack into the recording device once it finished rewinding."Hello," he said with a thick, Russian accent."I have made many videos in Russian, but I have a feeling it won't matter.This last one will be in English."Russia has abandoned me.I was sent here as an experiment for the government, to see if we could set up a base, maybe build in secrecy.The journey was too harsh, and the travel time too long.I burned more fuel than we thought, and now I am stuck here.They told me that nobody will be coming to save me.The man's breath grew shaky, and he wiped at his eyes."I asked to speak with my family.They said no.They said nobody will ever know of my time here.My death will be faked in an accident upon re-entry of Earth's atmosphere.Parachute failure.I have spent two months here now, and oxygen is almost gone.Food is still here, but that does not matter.I will die alone, and nobody will ever know.I die for nothing."I do not expect to be saved.Maybe nobody finds this.I don't know why I film.If you do, please tell my daughter I love her.Maybe my wife if she's still alive.I only wish I could tell them myself.I end things now.May you find your way home."I pushed the screen in and sat down.*Pioneer: A word we invented to make ourselves feel better about being guinea pigs.*

A hundred years, shards of future in dreamy visions of lessons and love, expanded his mind like a sponge in water.It drank the knowledge, swelling, evolving millions of years in mere moments as he slept.By the time his eyes opened, it was like his head felt heavier, and his heart drooped with the pain of a hundred false losses.The world he'd been born into suddenly felt foreign to re-forged eyes.The One rose, a mental giant amongst skittering animals once seen as peers.He saw light bouncing off the Earth as vectors studied in physics class, and noted a slight curvature to a horizon that always looked flat.The stars no longer looked like specks of mineral in the distance, but giants, ancient relatives that began it all.He wanted to speak, but a numb, dull tongue felt like lead in his mouth.That would require some work.Yes, work; there was so much to do, wasn't there?Problems to solve, knowledge to share, technology to build... why, the implications were immense.The world's order could totally rearrange because of him.A genetic catalyst that bombs the timeline.Grassland underfoot tickled as he strode determined toward his pack.It would take organization, and a lot of effort, but The One knew he could do it.He could change it all.With a purpose, and visions of worlds untold, he stood up straight and tall just like the smooth-skins of his premonitions.Unfortunately, the waning Oligocene Era was not one for casual strolls in a meadow.A slinking nimravid, effectively a bobcat with daggers for teeth, shifted low in the underbrush, eyeing her meal as it oddly limped on two legs instead of four-- injured, most likely, a prime target-- toward the treeline.-----------

*Alternate ending for fun*

More than any of that, he knew his purpose was to rally and lead.Stoke a fire and gather the wild creatures, dumb though they may be, to a greater purpose.It would take time, and a lot of effort, but The One knew he could do it.He could change it all.With a purpose, and goal in sight, he stood up straight just like the wrinkle-skins of his premonitions.He would rally the wild men and form a tribe, then an empire from there.An unstoppable force.*This is gonna be yuge,* The One, the smartest being alive, thought to himself.----

I stared at the bald, fat man, entirely dumbfounded by the words he'd chewed up with some steak and spat out at me."I'm sorry, sir, are you-"

"Yes, idiot, I'm firing you.I don't much like the looks you give me during meetings, or your arrogant attitude.Your work is fine, but one rude employee breeds many more."Rude?I hardly considered pointing out the flaws in his business plan rude, it was free help from a successful billionaire, if anything, but bit my tongue."I implore you to reconsider, sir.You're losing a valuable asset."He bellowed a laugh, spitting little chunks of steak and parsley onto the table."See, this is the problem with you fools.You think that, for some reason, there aren't ten million other '*middle class*' workers to take your place.Now please, leave before I lose my appetite."I smiled."I think that would be about as easy to lose as a mountain in your backyard."He grumbled something through his lunch, but I'd already made my way out the door.It only took a few minutes to pack, since I never bothered to flaunt wealth in the office, and I stood at the entrance before leaving.I glanced across the mundane grey cubicles, like cookie-cutter housing in a suburb, frantic people running in and out of them.A few potted plants and cheap painting prints popped out against the grey, which only served to highlight its gloominess rather than distract from it.*Motherfucker calls me arrogant?Bitch, I make more money than you could stuff into that blimp of a body you ride around in.I worked in this shit office, watching you destroy it, with only a few comments here and there to help, and you never even knew who I was.*

It was a hideous office, no doubt.Absolutely atrocious, and a blatant statement by Buchanan that he didn't give a single shit about the workplace he created for his employees.Well.They're only *his* employees for now.On the path to my car, I called my secretary."Helen?Yes.I need you to order a few things for me.Call Henry and tell him to hold an impromptu expo in two days.Call it 'Tech Expo 2019' or some shit, I don't care, but it needs to be hyped.Rumor needs to spread very quickly that the biggest names will be there, even if they won't be.Use contacts as necessary to fake the info.We'll need catering for it, preferably foods with honey like balaclava or whatever the fuck it's called, shit like that."And bees.A lot of bees."*Not only am I buying your company, asshole, but I'm getting a fucking discount.*

In a room blacker than night, devoid of stars or any other such beauties, I floated.It was some shattered gap between nowhere and everywhere, the kind of lonely afterlife I'd always imagined would suit me best.I deserved nothing more.It stayed that way for -- how do I put this?Forever, and yet not forever.I did not age, or move, or even feel the eons slink by in a human manner, and yet I knew it had been an eternity by the time the angel first appeared.He was a stark contrast to the void around us, brighter than the sun, yet cast light on nothing, as if his glow were being devoured by the abyss.Suddenly, I was standing on a circular piece of stone, and had some semblance of weight and being.The angel opened his arms and spoke not in words, but directly to my mind."Timothy Halpert Bennington.You are now ready for judgment."Judgement.Ha, of course the afterlife would be something like religions predicted.I'm sure my life had left a bad taste in God's mouth.I didn't respond, only stared into the nothing below me."Your first Judge: the one you were cruelest to in life."I cocked my head, brows knitting into a line.People from my life would be judging me?*No.No, please, just send me to Hell.*

My eyes tried to shut, like slamming the door behind you to avoid a conversation you don't want to deal with, but something kept them open.The angel hadn't moved a muscle, and yet, I knew it was him.A pocket of light smudged something within itself.That smear of darkness stepped forward, onto another stone tile, and clarified as the pocket zipped up.It was her.I knew it would be, but that didn't make it any easier to bear."Oh, Timmy, you're so young," she said, a soft smile on her face."I've missed you so much."I couldn't meet her eyes and searched for words, but my lips only trembled, mouthing empty motions.My eyes fell to the stone beneath her."Look at me, Timothy."I obliged."When you were a boy, no more than fifteen, you once burned all of my photo albums.Not just the ones with your father in them, but the ones of us, family trips and gatherings, every memory I ever had.They were erased forever, those last bits I had of him and our carefree times.I cried every day for a month, when you weren't home.That was my joy, mementos of when life was simple and fun, which you turned to ash."There was nothing I wanted more than to squeeze my eyes shut, but I could not; I was forced to watch the sadness in her eyes as she spoke."That was your most cruel action-- it hurt me more than when your father left us.He had always been unkind, but for you, the light of my life, to torch away our memories like that... it broke me."Before I could muster the courage to apologize, she slipped away into light.I felt sick, so humanly sick in my stomach, but knew there would be no relief.One does not vomit in the afterlife.The angel offered me no reprieve."Your second judge: the one you were most kind to."Once more a flash, and once more an approach.My eyes widened, face flickering as I tried to understand."You didn't expect to see me again, did you?"Her smile was wide and bashful."How...?""Oh, silly boy.The mind plays tricks on us sometimes.You probably thought that, because you'd caused me a great pain in life, there was no way you could have brought me joy, but life is not that black and white.It's so much more than that."Still I searched, and still I found no words."You were harsh -- even cruel -- at times, but it wasn't always like that.Your pain changed you, and even then, you weren't a purely cruel person.Just one that lashed out once in a while because you didn't understand how to handle it.Life can get very confusing."This is my favorite story.When you were ten -- such a cute little man -- you wrote me a poem for a school project.I'll never forget the words on that card: *To Mom, my bestest friend.I love you more than gummy bears or mac and cheese.You make me happier than Racer when I drop a potato chip and he eats it.Happy birthday to the best mommy in the whole wide world.* You wrote that on a card decorated with hearts and smiley faces.You didn't know it, but that was right when I'd first been diagnosed and your father started to show signs of his poor character as a man.Then, on top of it, you cooked me dinner, and it was so bad but I ate every bite.It was the best meal I've ever had."Never in my entire life have I felt as happy as I did in that moment.You were such a deeply caring boy before everything went wrong."I barely even remembered any of that.Had I really done something to make her happy?Why didn't I remember it, when I remembered such other, terrible things so clearly?She disappeared into the light as I searched my soul, digging for answers but only turning up dirt.The angel, kind as he was, did not let me take a moment to figure things out."Your third judge: the one whose life you saved."I froze.The one whose life I saved?I'd never saved a life, I'd only done things far from it.Perhaps it was standard practice, and no one would walk through the portal this time.But, just like clockwork, she was back again, her smile warmer than the halo over her head.I gaped at her."No.No, I killed you.This makes no sense, I didn't save you.Is this some kind of sick joke?Do angels play pranks on people?""Oh, sweetie," she said, shaking her head."It was mercy.Besides, the sickness had already stolen me.Letting me go in peace in no way makes it your fault.Have you held yourself accountable all this time?"I couldn't find it in me to respond, mashing my teeth together instead."It was my time to go.There was so much pain and suffering that plagued me, in the end; my sickness was no fault of yours.The fact that you put all your hurt aside and stayed with me so I wouldn't be alone meant more than the world.You did the most brave thing a boy can do for his mother, and saved me.Finally, there were words I found that I'd been looking for, choked and jagged as they were."I love you, Mom.I'm so sorry I wasn't a better son.""Shh, now, darling.Your hurt is almost over.I'll be waiting for you."One final time, she faded away."And now, your final judge," the angel said."The one whose life you took."My nails bit into the skin, I clenched so hard, and I breathed deep to keep myself together in front of the angel overseeing it all-- though, honestly, hiding things probably didn't work when in the presence of Godly beings.For when the swirling portal of light opened, it was not my mother that walked through as it had been the previous three times.No, it was someone much more familiar, and somehow, more terrifying.Me.I fought hard to look away, harder than I'd fought before, but I just couldn't.There was no power in me, wherever I was, and so I simply stood there, frozen and sobbing at my own reflection."This is probably pretty rough for you," he said, pursing his lips.I let out a croak in response."You've always been too hard on yourself, you know that?Isn't it time that you get a little peace, too?""I don't deserve it," I whispered."Everyone does.This world is a complicated and terrifying place, and everyone knows their own pain.You lived a life consumed by yours, more than equal penance for your mistakes."You've heard what she had to say, and seen the smile she still wears.You hurt her, yes, but you were also the joy of her life.Your father left because she was sick, not because you weren't worth it; he was the problem, not either of you.Your mother loved and still loves you, and you're not a bad man for the things you suffered.I only wish I could've shown you that earlier."But, alas, I digress.Let's not do this-- you've spent long enough convincing yourself you don't deserve to be happy.It's time to rest, now, Tim.Be at peace."He held out a hand.I stepped forward and took it.---

When first we set foot on that tarnished land, a scorched sliver of utopia, there was a single word that came to mind:

Tragedy.The initial scouts were shocked to find remnants of a magical, adolescent species on a planet with no apparent atmosphere--and, upon closer inspection, we discovered that there are traces of an oxegynated layer, churning and sparse, like silent static.A hidden remnant cursed to dance over the remains of what it once shielded from harm.Such is the cruelty of nature.We do not know what they would have looked like--our excavation efforts are still underway, but the baked soil is laden with mineral and rock, far too noisy to scan beyond.What we do know is that they died long ago, perhaps before any known species ever lived, before the formation of intergalactic searches and the pursuit of new life.Before our coalitions and technological integrations.Before any of us.They were alone on a budding planet, clawing their way towards greatness.Ruins of what must have once been structures that reached for the stars, monuments to their own feats--we even found traces of their efforts on an orbiting moon, and have hung the unique tapestries in the Iotian Gallery for all to see.Other debris and strange crafts were found drifting through the system, the scattered hopes and dreams of lonely beings desperate for an answer of any kind.I like to think they would've been our friends.A guiding hand that knows through toiling experience what it means to fight from the soil to the sky, to deliver themselves into the ceaseless stream of fate and scream, "*We will be heard!*"

For this, we remember them.Not as mysteries, but as mentors.Not for their demise, but for their struggle in an impossibly large and unforgiving void without meaning or sense.To think that they perished unsure of their place in this puzzle is wounding.And yet, even in the still-warm corpse of that tragic planet, not all was lost.Hidden among history, there were microbes, and small, arid flora tucked away in the shadows of whatever came before them.A final testament that, against any odds, not even catastrophe can end the virulent cycle of evolution.A rejection of the end in what little way was possible.The dying breath of premature gods.---
