I've seen it all.Flying men, space ladies, hell, even a robotic shark beast.But there's one thing that's held me back from doing what I love.My age, I'm turning 78 in a week.It's been twenty years since I've been commended in newspapers, saved damsels in distress from masked marauders, "saved the day".I walked through my house, where I had newspapers framed of my time as "Magnet Man".**Magnet Man saves woman from the Puff Gang!**
 
**Magnet Man and the League of Heroes stop Tigress's villainous plot!**

**Gravity God's plans foiled!Magnet Man stops plot to destroy California!**

As I walked down the hall, it got more depressing..

**Hunter, Grower, and Arson killed in battle with the Keymaster!**

**Hero turns on the League!Bullseye kills Samurai and Doctor Mind!**

**Miss Mist disappears after battle with Mr.Voodoo!**

**Magnet Man, Red Giant, Robo-Shark, Pulsar, and Jungle Boy retire from the League!Welcomes new members!**

I didn't retire.I was forced out of the League, as was Red Giant and the other original members.They said we were getting too old for the job.I was 57 when I was kicked out, as was Red Giant.Robo-Shark doesn't age, but they still kicked him out.Pulsar lives to be 1000, but apparently 52 is "too old".Jungle Boy just left.As I was walking to my recliner, I passed by my suit, still preserved in the gravity pod given to me by the Postim Empire.Alongside it was Miss Mist's uniform.The inscription at the bottom of the pod said: "To Jordan and Lana Miller, heroes of Earth and saviors of the great Empire.""I'm sorry Lana."I wiped my eyes before turning around to go sit down.I grabbed the remote and turned on the TV."This just in!Chronos and the Legion of Villainy are attacking United Plaza!The League is on there way to apprehend the the villains now!"I frowned and turned off the TV.I needed something to drink.I walked over to my cellar and entered the code.The musk of wine and cedar filled my nose.Just like home.I went over to one of the bottles and pulled it out.I heard a small beeping noise coming from nearby.I turned, only to see it was my old League card.I picked it up."Lotta good memories in this card.." I muttered, putting the card into my pocket.I walked out of my cellar and back to my chair.I turned the TV on and looked at the card.The flashy red "L" was all covered in dust, I wonder how long it's been in there.I was just about to put the card back in pocket when the news was flashing the "BREAKING NEWS" alert."This just in!The League is losing the fight!Somebody, help!"My eyes widened and darted down to my card.I wiped the dust off and pressed down on the "L".Immediately, it lit up," Is anybody there?"I said into it.It was silent for about two minutes, but then I heard Red Giant's Australian accent," Holy hell, Jordan?""Marcus, it's great to hear from you, the League needs our help!"He was quiet for a moment," I'll contact Robo Shark and Pulsar, you get Jungle Boy!"I hung up and attempted to call Jungle Boy, instead, I got a younger voice," Who is this?""Is this Jungle Boy?""N-No, this is his daughter, Maurice died of a heart attack three months ago.."

"Oh, um, I-I.. Just tell him Jordan sends his regards."I hung up.*Two hours later...*

"The League has refused to give up!Magnus, Megaton, and Wonder Girl are still fighting!"The news shouted as I drove over to the old League base.There, I saw Marcus, Pulsar, and Robo Shark standing there.I opened the door, and almost immediately, Pulsar hugged me."By the Gods!I'm so glad you're here!Where's Maurice?"I sighed," He died three months ago.""Oh.."

Robo-Shark armed his pulse cannon," Then I guess this fight is for him then."I smiled," This fight is for more then just him.This for Lana, for Arson, for Hunter, and for humanity."I put on my magnet suit and began to float in the air," The League doesn't die today."TBC
