I slowly opened my eyes, preparing for the pain to hit me like a wave of hopelessness.The room was too bright and my eyes were still adjusting to the bright sun.Stage IV pancreatic cancer had meta.. metas.. "Fuck, I've heard this said to me a 100 fucking times" I thought to myself.Maybe it's finally spread into my brain, fucking yay.It was hot this morning, I could feel the sweat sticking to me but it felt different, like I wasn't wearing my hospital issued robe.My eyes were finally adjusting and 
I moved my right arm to reach for the little button that gave me a shot of painkillers, which was always too little to help with the pain and pressing it more than once never gave me any more but I did it anyway just in case.But it wasn't there and I wasn't in a hospital room but outside lying down under a massive oak tree.It was so hot, even under the shade.I had no idea what the time was.There was nothing in the horizon, not power lines, buildings, roads, nothing.But I had this feeling gnawing at me, that I knew this place.That I had been here before.I tried to call out for the nurse, my son but nothing came out of my mouth except some garbled moans.I couldn't remember my son's name, what state I was in, what my wife's name was.I knew I had a wife who died a year before and we had a son but it was all slipping away like when you're waking up from a dream and trying to hold on to the details but no matter how you try you can't.I hear a noise next to me and I turn my head slowly.I see a woman, naked, a primitive looking face, black hair and a slim but muscular build.Looking at her, I thought to myself " I know this face".She was looking at me with hopeful relieved eyes.I look down at my body, I'm naked and I'm young again but with a lot of hair all over my chest, abdomen and arms.This is the first time I realize I feel no pain.I can't remember what disease I had but what was pretty evident that I had a raging boner.She sat down next to me and I put my arms around her thinking I was in this exact place before overlooking the sun which was setting now in front of us.I also remembered what we did after we sat looking at the sunset, it was all coming back to me.My old life that ended with cancer a distant after thought.I took her hand her and made her lie down and I got on top of her, looked into here deep dark brown eyes and I was inside of her, just like I had done many a times before.
