Ten of us won.'Run.'No one expected what happened next.'Huh?''I said run.RUN.'**\*MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH, C'MERE YOU** \*

3 or 4 days agothe kids don't know, they've lost track of time, lost a way to keep it--The Ten Luckiest Kids In America(tm) who pulled a golden Oreo from the packaging were picked up by the Oreo Corp and brought to the main Oreo Headquarters.It was part of their Willy Wonka 7 crossover, hoping to gain back the markets lost to Vienna Fingers and those pretzels with the peanut butter bugs inside.The reward?An invitation to O. Reo X55VT factory, the latest in Oreo Delivery Bot technology, where they were to receive their Perma-Sealed vouchers for the lifetime supply.As long as those boys had beating hearts, Oreos would be delivered to them

Soon, Oreos were flying off the shelves.Free Oreos forever?Not only did it sound delicious, but it was economically viable, with hundreds of mouths potentially being fed from America's Favorite Cookie.From the richest kids to the poorest, dollars were coming out of the Munch Cards of americans and straight into the Oreo corp.Even with careful placing to extend the promotion and milk the most, it didn't take long for the tickets to be pulled.There were ten kids, all ushered into the factory, through the many illustrious halls, past the thousands and hundreds and thousands of bots whirring below and above and around as they trudged through the factory and finally reaching the last tasting room.It was the willy wonka tour of Oreos, except all the kids made it through to the end room fine, a long room with a long table awaiting them.An O. Reo X55VTtall, large, similar to the attack bots in New Vegas, y'all know what I mean--awaited them at the head of the long, magnificent table of polished marble and slate, the walls tall, adorned with tapestries of Oreos abound.On either side of the O. Reo stood business types, older, greyed tips, and warm faces.This was the best day of their lives!, they said and such as they welcomed the kids, this is the magnificent future!Soon plates came in with all sorts of Oreo delights, from the actual Oreo itself to ice cream to candies to yogurts to cakes to pastries and everything that could have a grain of sugar in it.The kids at themselves full, oh they could not stop eating, with Oreo after Oreo.Each time they dipped an Oreo into the massive glasses of milk in front of them, a O. Reo would come in to replace it, a fresh deep each time.It was heaven!Then, the sirens went, the lights red, and panic set in on all the organics.'Oh no.'Said one executive.'Is it happening?'The other didn't answer.A bead formed.'Well kids, aren't you just having the luckiest day?It turns out, the day the bombs actually drop, you're \***here**\*, the best bomb shelter in the world, with a lifetime supply of Oreos!That means not only are you safe, but you'll have a food source for the rest of your lives!'A louder siren raged.The face of the O. Reo turned into countdown instead of smiling, welcoming & warm.The letters read against the cold computer background.The executives turned white, the kids grew more scared.'Sir?'One kid piped up, 'Why are there numbers?''Well, I shouldn't really be wasting time,' one executive said as the other ran out the door, the one staying keeping the facade of familiarity, the other broken beyond repair, only able to go where his legs demand, 'But you kids really oughta run.Or hide.Or something.Cause somebody not here, well, they \* own\* these cookies, ok?And they need them.And he can feed us for...well...you better hope radiation clears in a couple days.'The bot remained completely still at that time going forward, except for the feeders.If they knew what they would do in no time...those bots did not show fear, anticipation, anxiety, not one bit of foresight into the horrors they would engage in; they would all learn how still a robot could be, how fast it could fly with blood in its eyes, where the quiet ones wait when you sleep.They would find the kids, or try to, feed as many as the found kid could eat, and then go get more.2 days, the kids did not know that some would be fed like ducks with a liver to turn, some did not know the horror a joy brings.The kids did not know how well they could hide.The kids did not know how loud they could scream through sealed lips.The man ran.The kids looked around.The sirens blared.The horror awaited.The lifetime supply would soon be over.When there's none left to force, why waste the life?The kids knew.The kids ran.The kids hid.If only they know.
