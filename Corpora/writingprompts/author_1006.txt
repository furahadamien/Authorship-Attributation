CutleryOfDoom
The box sat at the front of where my house used to stand.Unopened, untouched, unravaged by the world.At first, twenty years ago, it had made me smile, thinking that someone somewhere was holding on to the old world.Maybe the factory workers had kept working, right to the end.Maybe the postal worker fancied themselves a Mad Max, a road warrior hell bent on delivering this package.Maybe there was someplace that hadnt endured the collapse.He chuckled now, thinking about it.Maybe, so many maybes.There was nowhere safe, no someone on the other end of the line.It was just an automated process.Put into place thirty years ago and somehow, improbably, still going strong.It was more a testament to mans ingenuity than anything else.Still, the boxes kept coming.Winning the contest hadnt seemed like such a godsend at the time.Hed been excited, sure, but any 9 year old kid would have loved a lifetime supply of Oreos.After the Collapse which ended the world, theyd been his major food source.To be honest, he was getting a bit sick of them.He had tried everything he could think of to catch the mysterious deliverer of the Oreos.To this day, hed tried countless hide and seek maneuvers, electronic surveillance, tag teamed watches, and nothing worked.He would watch all night, waiting for any sign, only to be disappointed.Yet there the Oreos would sit anyway.Every month, without fail.Like clockwork.About five years back there had been a small survivor community that settled nearby.The Oreos had been all the currency hed needed to trade with them.Not only were they a nostalgic item for the older survivors, but they were a special treat for kids.Nothing else was really special anymore.When civilization ended, so did everything.He sometimes wondered if that was all humanity was.The end of things seemed to him to be the end of people.Of all the survivors hed met, theyd all been so focused on existing that theyd lost what made them who they were.No more joy or laughter or art.Just survival.Then here he was, with a box of magic Oreos, and more coming every month.It wasnt simply a cookie.It was a lifeline.The last vestige of hope that he had.He was older now, harder, and hed had to endure many awful things post-collapse.The old stories of warriors and loyal workers held no appeal for him now.But he found hope in that little box anyway.It didnt look special, contained nothing truly desirous, but it came every month.Persistence in the face of extreme adversity.Something about it made him believe, in some small corner of his heart, that maybe humanity could survive this.If they could just keep going, just keep moving forward, month by month, then eventually things would change.He walked over to the box and picked it up.Its familiar shape comforted him.Looking around at the deserted ruins of his home, he laughed.An old line from a movie had popped into his head, but it seemed to him that Forrest Gump had gotten it wrong.Life wasnt like a box of chocolates.It was like a box of Oreos.You always knew what you were going to get and when you were going to get it.Chuckling, he made his way towards his bunker with one thought stuck in his mind.Death comes for us all in the end, but until then, the Oreos come too.
