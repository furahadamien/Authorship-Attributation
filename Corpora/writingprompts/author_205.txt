It's been weeks since I regained my sight.The messages... the **message** was scrawled everywhere.In different mediums, different handwriting... always you could see the frantic fear in the strokes of paint or blood or dirt or shit.Weeks since I felt the joy of regained sight, replaced immediately by ultimate fear.I didn't even know what I was afraid of.Who "Them" were.But the message was everywhere and you bet your ass I was afraid.For weeks I've been pretending to still be blind, going about my 'normal' life.I walk most places with my eyes shut, worried about giving myself away... after all, *someone* might see me.So many messages, it can't have been one person who wrote them.And they can't have done it blind.So -- somewhere out there -- there are sighted people.And they left a message *for* sighted people.***So are "Them" blind?***

The realization stops me in my tracks.Another pedestrian bumps me and immediately goes around without an apology -- collisions are expected in the new world.*Written messages would be useless if... whoever-they-are could see them...But then how--*

In that moment I see a man on a far street corner.He is leaned against a building, watching me intently.**Watching me.**  His eyes dart to one side and I glance over to see two men clad in black, wearing silk blindfolds, cutting too-efficiently through the crowd, coming right for me.The man at the corner slips away.I feel the fear gripping me anew.
