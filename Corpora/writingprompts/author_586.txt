"Do you believe in destiny, Liz?""Don't call me that!"I snarled."My friends call me Liz, people who care about me call me Liz."Robert put his palms up as if to pacify me."I understand you're upset, Liz," he said as he moved closer to rest his arm on me.I flinched away, scowling.He needed contact to wipe my memories."You're a fucked up person, you know that?"I said."What kind of sicko wipes someone's memories and then takes advantage of them!"I shook my head."When I woke up in that bed, alone, confused, not remembering anything - you were there, but..." 

"It was either that or kill you, Liz, and I couldn't have bared to kill you," he said, his eyes were watery and he sounded sincere, but he had looked sincere when I'd woken up without memories, and he'd been holding my hand."Even if I knew this would happen..." he said and sighed.I gave a short bark of laughter."No, I'm pretty sure you didn't, Rob," I said."Pretty sure you wanted to keep me ignorant of my past forever, and have me be your lovely little wife till the end of time."Robert shook his head."No...I knew how you would react if you did.There's something...more about me and you, people in general, than just memories.Call it destiny, genetics, whatever.You can wipe out their memories, but they make the same mistakes again and again.You don't see the potential in a new start, but anger over the past.You become the same person all over again, no matter how many times I try."My eyes widened."What do you mean by no matter how many times I try?"Suddenly Robert moved, impossibly fast and pressed his thumb against my wrist.I didn't even have time to scream.A strangely familiar numbness began to spread through me.I couldn't recoil as Robert kissed me and caressed my cheeks.The last thing I heard sent chills down my spine, even as I faded."Destiny or not, Liz, I will keep trying, no matter how long it takes."***

*The scene is a room with a single desk.A weary looking woman chews on gum while looking through her phone.A 7 foot demon sits on the chair across from her with a collar around its neck, its wicked sharp horns scraping against the ceiling.Outside a single window a scene of desolation can be seen.Plumes of fire, rivers of lava and all that.Occasional screams can be heard in the room.The woman ignores them, but each scream makes the demon flinch.*

Woman: (Looking up from her phone) "Name?"Demon: "Ashmodeon seventh spawn of the great seer Glarastell, heir to the mig-"

Woman: "Alright, Ash it is.Now Ash what did you do in hell?"Ashmodeon: (Snarling) "Insolent human, how dare you mock my name as such!You will-"

*The woman sighs and taps a button under the table.The Demon writhes in pain as the collar around its neck glows a bright blue.*

Woman: (Looking at her phone again) "Like, seriously.I have a quota to fill, so why don't you just answer my questions and we can both be done with this.Sounds reasonable yeah?"Ash: (Smoke coming out of its nostrils) "So be it."Woman: "Alright, so what did you do in hell?"Ash: "Very funny human, surely you know I am a dread lord, I led mighty forces against your pathetic."Woman: (Almost to herself) "Military, got it."Woman: (Looks up from her phone to glare at the demon who had opened his mouth to say something then thought better better of it): "How many humans do you think you have tortured?"Ash: "Billions, easily.I have made the vilest humans cry and beg."Woman: (Blow a bubble which pops in Ash's face) "Billions, got it.Final question, have you ever been to heaven?"Ash: (Frowning) "Of course not, why-"

Woman: (Sighing as she scrolls through Hellit(tm) for the millionth time) "So to summarize, you led forces against us, tortured us, and know absolutely nothing about heaven - making you useless to us, correct?"Ash: (Cocking its head) "Seems correct."*The woman presses another button and the demon, along with the chair falls through a hole under it.She rubs her ears from the echoing screams of the demon as it fell into the void.*

Woman: "Next!"***

"It's not the money, it's the principle."My father's words.Though I think he was talking about taking a loan, as in principal with an A L, but that doesn't really matter.It was free to find out who the culprit was, the bank does that for you.Not to help you, but to know who to put on their hit lists, your gain is just an added benefit.But for a petty crime like stealing 10 dollars, the bank does nothing.Apparently their policy only applies to thefts of more than fifty dollars.So I had to take matters into my own hands.The bank was kind enough to tell me who the culprit was, though: James Graham.Asshole extraordinaire.The bastard had stolen my lunch every time he was in lunch back in elementary school, which admittedly was not very often considering he had detention almost everyday.But still, having my apple juice carton ripped mercilessly out of my hands and disemboweled by another man is an image that will haunt me forever.And now, he had the nerve to come back to my life, and steal *my* money.Hell no.No sir.And so I plotted my revenge.According to Stalkbook, Graham lived in London.Now, I did not have the cash for tomorrow's train fare, so a flight was out of the question, unless I wanted to withdraw from my savings account...which I actually wasn't legally allowed to for ten more years.So I waited.I worked extra hours at the StellarDollars, even though my soul withered a little more every moment I stood and smiled at random people who had come to get coffee or milk or whatever the hell.I sacrificed some of my guaranteed interest on the savings account and moved it to an investment variant, where I could chose to invest the money into different stocks or companies.And I did.I had a plan you see, a plan so grand it would destroy him so utterly, so completely that he would lie broken at my feet, begging for mercy, and I, in my infinite kindness, would deny it.I read online articles, made the correct movements, predicted changes, made gambles.I cried, laughed, and died inside.And through it all only one name filled my mind, one name that fueled my drive, my relentless quest: James Graham: Asshole Extraordinaire.One day, of no particular import, the call that I knew would come, came.I stood up in the middle of the conference meeting, and dozens of chairs swiveled around and men in suits stared at me."Sir?"One asked, "we have to discuss this quarter's profits..."

I glared at him, and he fell silent.Without another word I stalked out of the meeting room, men and women staring at me as I did, but I paid then no mind.I pulled out my phone and answered."Sir, a loan verification from the name of James Graham has come in, asking for 2 hundred thousand," Stephanie said.I'd told her years ago to tell me when this happened.I'd bought out all the other banks in the area.He would have no choice to to borrow from mine, it was just a question of waiting.And the wait was over.I grinned."Stephanie, approve him, but internally make it a loan of two million," I paused, and continued, "and ten - discreetly of course."Stephanie had known me for years, she didn't ask any questions.So when Graham got his first payment due he was suitably surprised to find his loan payments about ten times what they had been.He went to the bank enraged, sure there had been an error.There was no error.The system clearly said he had borrowed 2 million, and now it was time to pay.Oh and pay he did.He could only watch as his house was sold, his wife divorced him, his kids hated him, his friends deserted him.I found him on the streets one day, begging with some coins in a cardboard box in front of him.I knelt down, patted him on the back and gave him a ten.James' eyes widened, and he looked up at me, almost crying."Th-thank you sir, thank you so, so much!"I just smiled at him and walked away, whistling a merry tune.***

I woke with a *BONG!*

The sound echoed in my ears, and sent me in a panic.I scrambled to my fee, and felt blood rush immediately to my head - everything went red and I almost fell over.Hands steadied me."Easy, easy, mate," someone said."Calm down, Alex, you're not dead, you're not dead."Dead.I was dead.My hands immediately went to my stomach.Looking for the whole where the sword had impaled me.i'd known he was feinting right, I'd known it!But still the bastard had gotten me.But there was no hole.I remembered to breathe again.I wasn't dead, I wasn't dead.Memories came rushing back, the ritual, the trip.Allie."Oh thank Kos, he's breathing again," Liz said."So, mate," Mark said, putting a hand on my shoulder "how did the trip go for you?"I looked around, taking in my surroundings.I was on some sort of mountain peak, standing on a platform that was about as big as a normal room.There were clouds in all directions around us, the only things on the platform were the three of us, our bags and a giant, gold metal disc suspended by three poles.It still vibrated slightly from the earlier "bong" it had made.And there was Allie of course.She lay on the wooden platform.Her eyes were closed - they had been for the past two stellar cycles.Her skin was a milky white, and her white hair fell down to her shoulders.Only her wings, a startling gold that were almost as big as her retained their color.The contrast against her pale skin and white hair was startling to say the least.I'd failed her again dammit.When I didn't answer Mark put his hand on my shoulder."Sorry, mate," he said.I turned to look at him, his blond hair in disarray and the feathers of his wings rumpled.His blue eyes told me all I needed to do.He'd failed too."She's gone, Alex, her soul is past the seventh gate by now, we can't bring her back," Liz said.She came in front of me and knelt down in front of me, putting her hands on my shoulders.Her green eyes looked into my eyes, her red hair and crimson wings adding to the effect."She's dead, Alex, we tried.We came all the way to this mountain, we did the stupid ritual, but we failed.We've done all we could," she said, her words almost pleading."No," I said, looking away from those startlingly green eyes."I won't give up on her, Liz, I can't.""She's dead, Alex," Liz said, shaking her head, "Permanently, now.We can't get her back."I shook my head, indignant."I'm trying again."Liz closed her eyes and took a deep breath.Her wings shuddered.When she opened those eyes again, all traces of sympathy were gone.She wasn't looking at me anymore, but behind me, at Mark.She nodded to him he did too, setting his jaw."Well, do it alone, then Alex," Liz said."Aye, mate," Mark said, "We've each gone down to the Nether three times now, we've been turned back and ejected every time.Let her go, mate.It's over."I gaped at them."You...you're giving up.After all those cycles, you're deserting her!""We're letting go, Alex," Liz said, her voice soft."That's not deserting her, that's moving on."I clenched my teeth."Fine, then, go.Go without me dammit, but I'm staying.I'm not giving up on her.""Mate.." Mark began, but Liz shook her head."We won't help you destroy yourself, Alex," she said, and gestured to Mark."Come on, Mark.We're leaving."Mark looked at me for a long moment, then nodded."That we are."They both looked at me one last time before walking to the edge of the platform and flaring their wings, each as long as they were tall, and took off.They didn't look back."Cowards," I said to Allie, stroking her hair."I'll get you, love, I don't need them."With that I hit the bong with the back of my fist, and lay down.*BONG!*

The last of the sound echoed in my ears as I was pulled back into the Nether to try to save not one soul, but two.***

Youre kidding, Brad said, awed, Vipsania, like *the* Vispania.

Chad grinned.The one and only, Emperor Augustuss wife.

Bard shook his head in disbelief, N...no way man, theres no way you pulled that off, the guards, the emperor himself

Chad looked hurt.Brad...youre doubting me?You would think *I* would lie to you, he said, aghast.Shut up, Brad, Chad said, and Brad grinned.What would Jesus think, man, Chad continued,  He told us not to lie!

Im not lying, man, look, Ill prove it you, Brad said and pulled a piece of cloth out of his pocket and handed it to Chad.Thats real gold lining the edges, bro, and the shape of the emperors seal.

You...you took the queens For the first time in his life Chad was at a loss for words.They looked at each other for a moment, and simultaneously broke out in raucous laughter.It was like that, crying and laughing on the floor that Jesus found the two.He walked into their room and stopped.God help me, he muttered.Guys...guys, what did you do.

The laughing increased in intensity.Jesus massaged his temples.I swear if the emperors wine turned into piss again

Finally they controlled themselves.Jesus, that piss thing was hysterical and you know it, Chad said.Jesus pressed his lips together trying not to laugh, remembering the look on the Emperor;s face when he had taken the sip of the vintage wine.Brad and Chad smirked knowingly at him, but he shook his head in what Jesus hoped was a stern gesture.Seriously, I need to know, guys.I can reduce the fallout if I find out *early.*

Trust me, Jesus, Chad said, theres no way this one gets out. Jesus looked skeptical, but Brad continued, anyways why did you come here anyways?You need something?

Yeah, we need to make a statement condemning the emperor, Jesus said, would be good to have all the apostles.

What did he do now? Brad asked.Just an hour ago he announced hes divorcing the queen, even though he had *three* children!

The laughter that came then put the earlier one to shame.***

*Ah fuck.*

Lying there on my desk was an envelope.Vanilla, inconspicuous looking, flap slightly open.The person who'd done it hadn't bothered to lick the little adhesive or whatever to lick it.I knew I wasn't the only one who hated those.But I knew, *knew* like I knew the sky was blue what I would find inside there.Trembling, I lifted the flap and peered inside.Cash.I went to take the bills out, but I dropped the envelope on the floor, and the bills spilled on the floor.A dozen Benjamins stared at me, their eyes somehow accusing."Satisfied?"I whirled around, expecting to find someone there, but there's no one - just my trashy one-room apartment."In your head, dolt.Jesus Christ, mate, you'd think you would've gotten used to it by now."I didn't need to speak to it, or even think in sentences to it.As soon as a thought formed, it knew."None of your damn business how I got it, mate," the voice said again."You got your money, yeah?Stay happy."Thinking again.This time the voice laughs - it is a grating noise inside my ears, hostile, unnatural."Who did I possess?Are you kiddin' me right now, mate?"My heart started beating louder.I put on some flip flops and practically ran out of the apartment.I took the elevator to the bottom of the building, and nodded to Carl, the security guard."Carl," I said in the way way of greeting.Carl waved his donut at me."Did someone enter the building after me?"I asked.Carl frowned but shook his head."Nah, man.You came in from your night shift as usual, then you left again in the middle of the damn night, and then you came back like two hours ago.No one else came in or out."He blew air out of his nose."You got a weird schedule man."It took all my self control to smile back, and slowly, deliberately, step back in the elevator, with that same mocking laugh bouncing around in my head as I did.

*Wow, well isn't this quite something?*

You blink, as if you can't quite believe what you're hearing.*Yes, yes, you're not imagining it.I'm, "speaking" to you I suppose is how you would understand it*

"B...but," you say out loud and a couple of the other specimens stare to look at you in confusion.*Now, now.There is no need to speak out loud.I will be able to hear your thoughts.Your kind comes along so rarely, I would hate for you to get taken in to some prison and electrified*

"Electrocuted actually," you say, this time in your head.Then you shake your head, as if you can't believe what you just "said.""Wait...I...you..."*Use your words, now*

My mocking tone momentarily angers you, clearing your thoughts."Who, no, *what* are you?"you say, again, in your head.*Ah but you know already, don't you?You were just thinking about it*

You blink and frown."I was thinking about....something."Your frown deepens."I know what I was thinking about, I am thinking about it right now, and when I do, everything sort of goes blurry and I feel like I'm watching myself in third person...but I couldn't tell you what exactly I'm thinking about..." 

*Precisely!* 

My sudden excitement makes you jerk.Sometimes I forget how sensitive you folk you are.*Apologies for that, quite rude of me.But regardless, what you're feeling, there is no way to describe it in your language.Your language is bound inherently by the three dimensions, by a limited scope, which is all most of your kind is capable of seeing.*

"Limited scope?"you retort, "what sort of bullshit is that?"You're angry, understandably; after all, I've just insulted your species.*You know full well what I mean.Look around yourself, your fellow people, this...transport that you're in.What do you see?*

Your eyes widen, and you look around, your head jerking from left to right, up and down, out the windows, *beyond* the windows.You are like a child who has just been born into a new world.In a sense, you are exactly that.Then you look at me.There is no three dimensional direction, you just *perceive* me.You open your mouth to speak.*Stop.You will just confuse yourself by speaking in that tongue of yours.You now know what I say to be true.You no longer just see, you* ***perceive.***

"But..." you stammer, "I'm no philosopher!I'm just a guy bored on my commute to work.I was just thinking pointlessly about stuff!"*Throughout history, there have been very few who've crossed the barriers you have, and in an objective sense, they are the most capable of your species.Yet not a single one makes it in your history books.To arrive at this thinking, you cannot be thinking with a purpose, the very nature of Ascending to this thought is to stumble upon it.* 

You give this a moment of thought, then nod, agreeing.Then your frown deepens.I know what you're about to ask.*Yes quite right.There really is no point to it all.And no, you will never be happy going back to your life.*

You do not protest, you are well past such silly things.You know it to be true.Instead you set your jaw."I will undo it all then, forget all of it.I just want my life back!"*Which is exactly what everyone else who's made the discovery has, said, your species or otherwise.They all say the same exact thing within moments of first Ascending.*

"Has anyone done it?"you ask, and for the first time fear creeps into your voice.*I've been trying for as long as time existed.No avail.*

"Then...." Again, like clockwork, I know what you're going to say.*You'll kill yourself?*

"You think I won't?"you say, again that anger rising.It's funny how even after Ascending, certain traits still remain common.*Oh you will try, we both know, but you know too that nothing will happen.You are now the same thing I am, Death itself.You will wander like I do, like a handful of others do, throughout time and space, killing as needed, breeding as necessary.Giving them the release you wish you could achieve.I believe your kind calls it artificial selection.*

At first you're sickened, aftereffects of the old reality.But then you speak, and your voice is calm."To find someone capable of Ascending beyond us," you say.*Precisely.Only they will put an end to our suffering.*

Everyone else has left the transport, but you're still sitting where you were, looking the same, but fundamentally changed, likely forever.You look around, trying to get one last glimpse of the world that was once yours, but its too late.You can no longer see it as it once was.For you, it is already gone.*For what it's worth, I'm sorry*

Her hand trembles as it strokes my head.I can feel the blood flowing weakly through her skin, and I look up at her with concern, my eyes wide.She says something strange, I can never understand her, but her smile lights  up my world.I let out a little bark of excitement and wag my tail.She loves it when I wag my tail.I get the reaction I wanted, and her smile widens, and she begins to stroke me even more.After an eternity she stops.I howl my disappointment but she doesn't continue.She tries to get on her two feet, that's how they normally walk, but rises and then sits back down.Perhaps she decided to play after all?My tail begins to wag and excitement fills me once more.But when I look at her I find though that she's not smiling.Instead there's a grimace on her face, she's in pain.Worry shoots through me, and I jump on to her chair, and begin to lick her.Usually this gets a laugh out of her, but she can only manage a weak smile.*It's okay,* I tell myself.She's been sick before.Like that one time she was in bed for a one sunrise, and when she was in that scary place with the white walls and beds for 3 sunrises.She always came back, she's always okay.I whine a little, mostly to reassure myself, but I just can't shake the feeling that there's something wrong, something wrong with *her.* 

Suddenly I feel the muscles under her skin contract.Oh no.I don't know exactly how, but I knew something was wrong.Something even licking couldn't help.She started breathing in short gasps.I had to get help, find someone.I began to run around her very large kennel, barking as loud as I could.The doors were locked so I couldn't go outside.But someone had to hear me...someone had to help.After several minutes of this, no one arrived, and then I heard it.Heard her.She was calling my name.Softly yes, but my hearing is sharp.I heard her.I ran to her, and jumped on her soft chair and licked her.There was some bad tasting water near her nose and eyes.She was weak, very weak, her breaths were getting shallower and shallower.She said something again, but her words didn't really matter.I could tell by the smile and her sad looking eyes what was about to happen.Even though everything I knew told me it couldn't.Humans were supposed to live for centuries, so why now?Why me?She had looked after me and my dad and his dad and his mom and on and on.Why did I have to see her die, and why couldn't I do anything?But despite the despair I felt I stayed strong for her.I pressed up to her and licked her as her breaths got shallower and shallower, as her hand stroking my head got weaker and weaker.She had taken care of my family for seven generations, the least I could do was stay with her in her last few minutes.***

"Johnson, we got another code five oh seven."It was all I could do to not bang my head against my desk.Repeatedly."Rick, does it have to be me?"The portly man turned to me and said sympathetically."Sorry Matt, but it does.After your little 'drug bust' turned out to be glitter for a first-grader, chief has made it clear you get every job on the shit-list."I was still convinced we had been duped on that job, but I kept my mouth shut.Last time I brought it up chief Vick had almost fired me.I sighed deeply and got up.Code 507 meant that the trio had been sighted again.It happened so often that we had separate code *just* for them.Grumbling, I left the police station and went to my cruiser.I spoke into the radio, "where was the last sighting, Rick?""Near the Goldman Sachs international building, near..." he paused, probably pulling up a map, "Ah...near the intersection of fleet street and Fetter lane.Good luck, man," he finished, completely insincerely.I could just see him wearing that smug little smile on his face in my head.I said something impolite and turned off the radio.I drove through the crowded street of London.These assholes couldn't have picked any other time than 4 pm?Traffic was moving at crawl.This was the fifth call this month.They were always causing some public disruption or other, thinking they were "wizards."They actually had wooden sticks that they claimed vigorously were their wands.They weren't insane I was pretty sure.They were just high.Constantly.I was pretty sure they were high 90 percent of he time.The times we were called in was just when they were bad enough that people bothered to call the police.I finally arrived at the building, and sure enough, the three were standing there...under a bed sheet.Why me?I parked my cruiser by the curb and started moving towards them.They whispered among themselves excitedly, as if trying to keep their voices low.I finally walked up to them."Erm...what the hell are you doing?"The short one, made *shhh* noise to the rest, still not coming out of the sheet.My freaking life."I can see you, you know.And hear you."A series of gasps went up from them, and I pulled the sheet from them."You can see past the invisibility cloak?!"The short one seemed genuinely shocked."No," I explained gently, "this is just a normal sheet."*With some suspicious looking stains on it.* 

"Ha!"Now the girl was talking."You probably have some sort of counter-spell, this cloak was given to Harry by Dumbledore himself, and he would never lie."Oh right, the ever present Dumbledore.He was an insane guy.But also insanely rich.I'm pretty sure he was the one who provided them with drugs for his own sick amusement.Of course they trusted him completely."No, I've told you," fighting to keep myself calm, "Dumbledore is either insane, or a liar.Probably both.""Whatever, I'll let you guys off this time, standing under a sheet his hardly worth arresting you guys for."*Plus the paperwork would be hell.*  

Before I could say anything else the short one said screamed, "*Stupefy!*" and *threw a rock at me.*

I cursed as the rock struck me in the nose.Hard.I blinked tears out of my eyes and the girl yelled, "RUN!"It could never be easy.I took after them as they sprinted away.I was catching up to them when they got on some metal scooters, they called them "broomsticks" and sped away.I stopped running, I would never catch them now, they would disappear into the side streets.Whatever.It really wasn't worth it.I went back to the station, reporting I had never found them.Rick saw me when I came back in."I thought you were catching junkies, not getting plastic surgery, Matt.""Shut up, Rick," I said irritably and went to get an ice pack.***
