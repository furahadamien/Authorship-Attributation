*Don't tell them you can see.Don't... tell them you can see*, I read the words again and again and still I can't make sense of them.Maybe the capitalization has something to do with the importance of the message?*Don't Tell Them You Can See... DTTYCS...* No, that's not it.It's been three hours since my eyes began to work.I've panicked twice, puked once, and read the message so many times the words don't look real.The letters don't look real anymore.*Don't tell them you can see*...Someone clicks from downstairs in the house, an echoing click following soon after.The noises are accompanied, by the raucous laughter of my brother and his friends.They're probably listening to that podcast they like, the one that told stories from Before.I make my way from the room, to the bathroom, where I can see how dimly everything is lit.There's no need for light when you can't see.So I make the conscious effort not to reach for the light switch, and instead shut the door, using the little light from the outdoors to light up my face in the mirror.I study it curiously.I've never seen it before.I was blind before the Blinding occurred.
