I live in a world where Greg The Flying Grape is the most tweeted-about person.Apparently, he was a surgeon and created a material that can become weightless at will.The obvious next step was to replace his major bones with this material (he calls it GrapeMatter).He's a dick.I mean, all he does is talk to the media about how he can't save the world without help from all of us and how "we are all one people".I guess I should talk about 2017, where he saved 3 falling planes in 3 weeks and then saved 7 schools in one week from a shooter.Now everyone calls him the greatest person ever.I just want to have ONE WEEK where the media doesn't gush over his supposed awesomeness.So I decided I would assemble my crew.No, we don't mess around.We cannot be tracked.We work through the deep web.I've made some income through my deep web search engine, Not Evil.Shit, that was easy.We just PM'ed him through his Twitter account and invited him to an interview.We own an apartment in downtown Orlando and we've got a few traps set up.I am legitimately excited.Ok, I know he can survive a fully-automatic weapon from his adventures in California, but I'm not sure he can survive a shotgun.He can survive over 1000 degree temperatures in Fahrenheit and over 20Gs of force.So we won't kill him with knifes or guns.We do have the Fucking sun at our disposal and we have a few mirrors here and there.Let's get into position

Oh my God, he's here."Hello"
"Hello, my good friend"
"Ok, let's start this interview with a bang.What have you been doing in the last 9 months"
"Nothing much.I've just been a good person and have been enjoying the occasional interview"
"Have you realized that the media has been sucking your dick?""Can you say that on the air?""Oh, no.That would end terribly for me"
"What's going on"
"Alright, I'll level with you.I hate you.The media has twisted your heroics from last year and spun it to make it seem like news.""That sucks, but I can't control that"
"Not now, but you could have"
"And since I didn't, what are you going to do about it?""Is that a threat?""Maybe"
"That's funny, I was going to threaten you"
"What are you doing?""Ok, you can go"
"I don't feel well, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?""I just shot a powerful, but invisible, and small Gamma-ray Lazer right into your heart.Nobody will notice it was me and you don't even know my name.""YOU GAVE ME CANCER?""Oh, that won't be what kills you.We have a giant freezer right above you"
"ARE YOU GOING TO-"
"No, were not going to crush you.We're going to take a giant ice cube and crush you with that.We have a truck to carry the Lazer and Freezer away.We have established a moving company and disguised the truck as that.We have also started a leak right above you.Enjoy that as you die.""Why?""Fuck you, that's why!"*Crushing sounds
