It was the worst thing they could have done to themselves, but they couldn't stand having us around.The lucky ducks.The ones who go from one disaster to another, never being seriously injured, always surviving, having life handed to us on a silver platter.So they built a prison in which nothing was ever left to chance.They found every one of us, and slowly but surely, locked each of us away.They never realized that they were dooming their entire existence.The more of us they locked up, the crazier the world got.Bombings, tornadoes, hurricanes, plagues, wars, you name it, it got worse.They figured that there must still be lucky ducks loose in the world, so the witch hunts got even more extreme.Rolling two 20's in a row was enough for your neighbors to turn into a lynch mob and hang you on the spot.Of course, they never stopped to think that if you really were a lucky duck, they'd never get to hang you.Finally, they had us all in one spot.For miles around us, everything went smoothly.Lives were perfect, no one got sick, everyone met their perfect match.Outside that zone, it was a never ending nightmare.You see, they'd locked up all their luck.Nothing could ever get too far out of whack with us around, it would have interfered with our luck for something too bad to happen.A lot of scientists had come to study us.Sure enough, one of them invented a nuclear shield that could cover the entire zone.Another a matter transformer, no lack of materials or food.Still another, an endless power source by tapping another dimension, no lack of power to run everything.We were completely independent of the rest of the world.Finally, it happened, global nuclear war.We're the last of humanity, outside is a raving nightmare.And the scientists finally figured it out.They broke us out of that perfect prison, and gave us wonderful homes at the edge of the zone.As we live there, the land becomes habitable again, we spread further out.We're going to repopulate the world, one lucky duck at a time.Every child we have is checked, nearly every child is a lucky duck.That's what happens when both parents are lucky.The ones who aren't still live a better life than anyone else ever did in the old world, because now the luck is evenly distributed.Every local problem is brought to us.If we can't solve it ourselves, it gets put to the entire lucky congress.Problems get solved though not all profit by it.There's still bad luck, but it's never too bad.In a way, we're still in prison.We cannot leave our assigned area, but we live like gods, because everyone knows we're *their* luck.Their ward against bad things.Their safety blanket in an otherwise cruel world.
