The world was fine, until it wasn't.One second, everything was fine.The next, darkness.Complete and utter darkness.People panicked, and many people died.I could still hear the screams of people accidentally falling off buildings, the countless bodies hitting the pavement, the horrid sounds of thousands of cars crashing all at once.It was a nightmare.Cars suddenly became bricks crashing through windows and people alike.Some houses burned as people couldn't find the knob for the stove.Some buildings collapsed as maintenance was near impossible without sight.The thousands of planes in the air eventually crashed as they all ran out of fuel.Extremely loud metal screeching could be heard as some ships slammed into the shore.After a year of utter chaos, the world finally began to settle.People managed to adapt, making improvised guide rails in stores and houses.Money was worthless now, since no one could work effectively anymore.Paper money was used for heating, and coins were used to give surfaces more texture.Humanity effectively had to start all over again.But then it happened, I awoke one morning, and I could see.My walls, ceilings, and floors were all littered with the same message: "Don't tell them you can see."It took a while for me to adjust.This wasn't the sight I was used to.Not only did I manage to survive for 2 years without sight, and therefore have forgotten how the world looked like it also all just looked...different...This wasn't normal sight, I could see more.I could *physically* see more, like infra-red, and RADAR.My vision wasn't the typical 180-ish view that you'd normally have either, it was far greater, more like 270...I could also sense more.I not only knew that there was a wall behind me, I could also physically "see" the wall.I wouldn't exactly call it seeing, it's more like *sensing* its existence, and being aware it is behind me.I pulled away my white sheets, without a cover.In all these 2 years, I hadn't once noticed that I was sleeping under sheets without covers.When I actually looked at my legs though, I found that something had changed...These were not the legs that I remember.It looked like an endoskeleton.I could see pistons, cables, pneumatic and hydraulic tubing.Some pistons were still moving like muscle twitches.The bones weren't bone either, however they weren't metal either.It was hard, but didn't look like any metal I knew.Upon further inspection, I noticed that my hands, chest and arms were like my legs too.My hands had cables connecting each finger, with a winch-like servo behind each finger.My hands were oddly enough more "developed" than other parts, though.Same goes for my feet.Plates that were separated by a small gap covered my feet and hands.I looked in the mirror, and my head was likewise robotic looking.It lacked many human features.The only human feature was its shape.The face was split into four plates, all disconnected from one another.They were moving about every now and then, as if allowing something inside the head to move, and then the piece would move back again.In the middle was a single sphere.It was glowing reddish orange, and remained fixed.After inspecting myself, I decided to go outside, and see what changed.I opened the door anxiously, expecting people to go crazy when they see an intimidating robot suddenly walk out their neighbor's door.To my surprise, no one reacted.Was I the only one who could see?I looked around and noticed that everyone seemed to have changed.Some seemingly slower than others.It seemed I was the most "developed".With a complete head, and plating around the hand, feet, face, ankles, and parts of the chest.Most people didn't yet even have the glowing red eye in the middle of their head.The world outside was a mess.Cars were still all over the place, wrecked.Some upside down, some wrecked beyond recognition.Some of them looked like they recently burned.It was as if this just happened... "Curious" I thought.I opened my phone, only to see that what we *perceived* as 2 years, was in reality 6 months.I walked around the city.There were several strange things around.Things such as massive metal stalks coming out of the ground.Most of the foliage seems to have taken over the city, and are secreting some strange green gas that's heavier than air."Has it really been just 6 months?"I thought to myself.It seemed our blindness has accelerated our perception of time.Made sense, since sleeping does the same thing.I walked to the port, only to find 3 massive container ships crashed on the shore.I could still hear the screeching of metal, and the bending of it.One of the dock cranes was still standing.There was a large container suspended from it.I could hear the tension in the wire and crane from all the way down here.I went back home, and went to sleep.I was still quite unused to my new metal body.When I woke up the next morning, I noticed that the rest of my body is now covered in plates.Plates similar to those on my hands and feet."Are these biological?It's clearly not normal metal.It's not like there's some stranger putting these on, is it?"I thought, and chuckled a little.Then, from the corner of my eye, I saw a black silhouette, then suddenly disappear, followed by a voice echoing from down the stairs, "Don't tell them you can see!"Followed by a muffled scream.
