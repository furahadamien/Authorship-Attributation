When will they learn?It was the fifth time in the last decade he had be kidnapped.The lengths the entire planet have gone to in order to rescue him have been astounding, but not all together surprising.Matt Damon was, after all, a planetary treasure.Mr Damon was targeted as a weak spot for humanity 10 years ago by the Reptilians of Centauri V. The Reptilians had been studying us for years.They thought they knew us and our lack of ability to work together.So they went with a plan that seemed foolproof: bring the planet to their knees by kidnapping Matt Damon.For a brief moment, the world was in shock."What could we do?"After the initial shock, the governments of the world gathered and decided they had no choice: they had to save Private Ryan.And save him they did.They sent a small contingent in to get him out.We had to use weapons that were developed in secrecy and ones all governments had decided unanimously they would never use.It was the "scorched Earth option" that overwhelmed the Reptilians; they expected this tech.They knew we had it.But they didn't expect our immediate aggression and anger.Matt Damon was saved, at the cost of many heroes that sacrificed themselves for his Sade return, and at the cost of an untold amount of Reptilians that were in the Earth's warriors way.A few years later, the Reptilians had bounced back and decided they were going to execute their plan again.This time, they were better prepared.They also watched the toll saving Matt Damon took on humanity.Not everyone was happy with the cost of victory.Did we compromise our very own morals to save Matt Damon?Humanity couldn't immediately reconcile that level of death and destruction put forth to save one single human.So that's why, when the Reptilians struck again,  many considered Matt Damon to not be worth more compromising.We had advanced rapidly in those few years since the last attack.Many government officials around the world recognized we could save Matt Damon again, but with much of humanity considering him expendable, did we put out the effort to save Jason Bourne?Whereas the first go around, they expected humanity to crumble and become their slaves to save Mr Damon, the second time, they expected humanity to destroy itself fighting over the correct course of action to take.They were planning on discourse.What they received instead was the nightmare.After the BBC broadcasted internationally a marathon of Matt Damon's greatest movies, interviews, Jimmy Kimmel live appearances, and that awesome clip from Eurotrip, the Reptilians soon learned their plan backfired.They were more in love with Mr Damon now than ever.They were angry.And they were not going to let this happen again.We killed them all.Every Reptilian.Humanity put into action was they've been practicing on so many species for so long.Complete and total annihilation.Genocide.Chemical, nuclear, quantum weapons, all used, with scary accuracy and even scarier results.They thought after that, a message was sent to the universe: Leave us alone; if you value your lives, forget about Matt Damon.To ignore this warning was to invite death upon your entire race.Two more times this happened.The Greys were wiped out entirely, being responsible for Matt Damon's third kidnapping.No one had seen one in years.During Matt Damon's fourth rescue, he was injured, leaving a permanent scar resulting in a bald streak on the left side of his skull.The forth species had been stricken from all written language throughout the galaxy.To even whisper their name would send shudders down the bravest alien warrior.Their retribution was swift, with no mercy, and without peer.Surely, no one would be foolish enough to do this again?We were wrong.The highest echelons of the UN had gathered and determined there is only one way to get the Martian back and send a final warning shot to the galaxy that could not be ignored: send in one man.Our second favorite planetary treasure:  Liam Neeson.God help any intergalactic species that gets in his way.
