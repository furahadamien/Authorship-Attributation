I sat in my easy chair with a beer bottle.It was my third of the evening and the wind blowing outside promised I could have a few more.The house was quiet and dark except for the low glow of the tv static.We hadn't been able to pay the bills for that.It was December and in a choice between gas and tv we had made the smart call.It had been easier when mom was helping.She helped with the bills.She made me laugh when things were gloomy.We were a team.We'd been a team for a long time and we kept each other alive.The depression had finally been stronger than our team.The tug of war was over.She was gone.Her pills laid scattered across the the room above me finalizing her form on the floor.I had to call the police.Or the Ambulance.Or someone...But instead, here I sit with beer in hand and wishing I had taken off today to stay with her.That I could have saved her the way she has been saving me since the eighth grade.That I could have been her rock.Like my dad was.Like he had been before things got to hard and he left in search of the iconic pack of smokes that is the holy grail for all deadbeat fathers.Like my father I left her today.To go to work.But she asked me to stay and I didn't.I told myself she'd be fine.I rationalized.You can't rationalize depression.I reached over to the coffee table and felt the cold metal of the gun that sits in front of me.I caressed it.I made a decision.'I can't leave her alone again.'I heard the rattle and clang of keys in the door and I jumped.I slipped the gun into my pocket and stared at the door.I felt wild.I felt fierce as the door knob turns and the door slips open."... i'm home!It was pretty busy and I saw this strange light...who the hell are you?"the stranger broke off as he caught a glimpse of me.I stared at him.I felt something in my head pounding and then there was a shift.I searched wildly through long forgotten thoughts and remembered a face I had tried to wash away."Dad?"I said tentatively."Who the fu...?Josh?Is that you?How...what...?"he stared at me in confusion.The flickering snow of tv static was playing tricks with features."You've been gone.For a long time.""I just left an hour ago,  what do you mean a long time?Where is your mom?"I kept staring at him.I felt tension in my neck and arms.I felt rage that he could walk back in here like nothing had happened.I felt sadness.I felt everything for the first time in an hour.Since the discovery.Since the beginning of the end."She is upstairs.She's been waiting."His eyes have finally taken in everything.The newer tv, the different decor.My older face and the tired jumpsuit that hangs off me.I can see his brain working overtime to process this revelation.He looks down at the pack of smokes in his hands.He mumbles something about the light."Son?I... don't know...?"I stopped him,  "It's okay.Let's go see mom.She'll understand.Everything can change in an hour."I lead him towards the stairs,  the cold metal in my pocket rests against my  other hand."We're going to be a family again."
