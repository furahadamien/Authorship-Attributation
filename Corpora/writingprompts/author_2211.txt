I had spent weeks tricking my newborn baby son into believing he was a wizard and I knew it worked because he grabbed my finger with his whole hand and laughed.Who knew that when I threw my infant at a pillar in a train station that he'd just disappear right into it and I'd end up in an insane asylum.
