"Goosha?"I said, tilting my head a bit."Who are they?"The alien looked at me strangely.I had difficulty reading his expression.He was almost entirely human in appearance, with angular features and an air of delicacy and grace.The only thing that would separate him visually from a human were his ears; they were long and tapered to a point, sticking out somewhat from his long flowing hair.But despite visual similarities to a human, his expression and body language were impossible to read.Impassive and imperious, utterly devoid of any movement that wasn't mediated and pondered.He spoke neutrally and flatly, "The Goosha?The Lords of the Sky?"I could only shake my head in ignorance.Who or what was a 'Goosha'?"I'm unfamiliar with that word.""So, the "red green blue" is accurate then?You don't have psir cones in your eyes?""I have no idea what... sire?sigher?Is.""A pity."the alien said, gesturing beside him."Because a representative of the Goosha stands before you."I looked to the side of him, and saw only empty air."Is this a joke?""Hardly."a snide tone slipped into the alien's voice, his posture subtlely shifting to a haughty loom."Goosha are about twelve inches tall, shaped bipedally like you and I, with psir skin and neoil hair.They have two diaphanous ciavi wings and communicate by glowing in a variety of colors.""I don't know what sire, knee-oil, and see-ah-vee are.""Hmm.I suppose not."the alien sighed resignedly."You would need psir cones to see the other colors that happen when you mix red blue and green with them.A pity. "he held his chin a moment in consideration."What about the Sebt?The Tintari?"I could feel my face getting hot."I don't know *those* words, either."The alien's expression grew...I think it was cold."The Lords of Magma and Sea?You don't know of them, either?"I slammed the table."Look, Mister... whatever your name was, if you wish to open contact with our world, you are going to have to stop with these juvenile pranks.There are NO people living on this planet by ANY of those names.""Re-open contact you mean."the alien said, not missing a beat."And my name is Aedwyn.We use to *share* this world with Men, before we left to cross the western sky.But it seems Men have forgotten much of their own people's past."In the empty space to Aedwyn's right, a burst of color suddenly flaired into existence, brilliant pinks and yellows.There were brief gaps of nothing, what seemed to be... *holes* in the light.I fell into my chair, mouth hanging open."What... was THAT?""That was my Goosha friend, making a considerable effort to speak in red-green-blue spectra for your convenience.A terrible strain on them, I do hope you appreciate it."Aedwyn settled into his chair, grinning knowingly."He was simply reminding me that Goosha, Sebt, and Tintari, are not the words you would know those people's by."Aedwyn's grin grew wider, as if coming to the long-anticipated punchline of a joke."Goosha: Fairy.Sebt: Dwarf.Tintari: Mermaid.And Iliene..." he tapped the points of his tapered ears briefly, "Elf.""NOW, maybe you remember?"
