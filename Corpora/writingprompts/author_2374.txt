Jairus bolted through the front door and never slowed until he reached the kitchen.In the kitchen was a little girl, who glanced at him with mild curiosity."How much time has it been?"Jairus asked."A couple of hours.Are you sure you didn't just go for a long jog?Sweat is beading up on your forehead.""I Travelled," was all that Jairus said as he ran to his room.His mobile phone was useless in this era."What are you looking for?"Clarisa asked with 

"The f*cking phone book!"came the answer."Hey, watch your language in this house."Her true age was shining through."Tell me whose number you need."She has excellent memory, which tormented her immensely with each death of a close friend.But as these things go, she somehow always found new friends in each era."Ben, and Lara.""I have those here," the little girl giggled as she put her finger to a temple."Why do you need them?""There's no time Claire!"Clarisa gave him a knowing look, like the mother that she'll never be."Look, I travelled back, not forward.I can't pinpoint to the exact hour so I'm a little late and **he's** coming for us right now."The windows shattered in a blast of hot air as if to punctuate his point.By instinct, both of them shielded their faces with their arms."I thought you said a couple of hours!"He shouted over the constant burning gust."Could have been three, you don't keep count when you get to my age!""I'll save you next time, I promise!"And then he was gone."Bloody good that would do me," the little girl muttered as she looked up at the swirling mess of rainclouds and fire as it descended upon her.The eye of the tornado was bright with fiery might, and she almost uttered his name before the mess engulfed her.
