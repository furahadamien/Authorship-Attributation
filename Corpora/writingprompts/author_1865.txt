It appears that the warden of this prison was some man named Kevin.Apparently through some stroke of the luckiest of good fortune, Kevin had stumbled upon a way to raise his luck meter to 1000.After that, his half witted follies and adventures had led him to a prison where someone else had initially started a plan rounding up all the lucky people of the world to create an army completely devoid of any actual intelligence.Kevin now found himself in charge of this army.This was an army of misfits, fools, dummies, and clutzes.A traditional armies would have absolutely no way to predict what the "lucky army" would do next.Due to the unpredictability of their leader, Kevin, and the differing levels of incompetence, each operation they launched succeeded.The first operation was aimed at securing a large amount of pizza so that they could feed everyone in the luck army.And who doesn't like pizza?So they launched this operation, and somehow they ended up defeating the entire Eastern region of military bases complete with the launch codes of all the nuclear weapons.
