Consciousness flooded James Bond all at once, but he did not show it.He stayed slack in his chair, eyelids limp, only listening.He sat strapped into the driver's seat, hands taped firmly to the steering wheel.They had put him in a thick white space suit that made his forehead prickle in fear-sweat.He turned his head toward the mirror.His visor was so dark he could not see his own eyes staring back at him.Beyond the car he heard nothing but the faint murmur of voices speaking on the other side of the glass.The back of his head ached in a slow, pulsing way, but he wasn't bleeding.Couldn't have been that bad.He could still think.He could still get out of this.He always could.Adrenaline erased the ache in his head, his horror and muted, near-forgotten panic.He knew where he was.Where he had to be.Someone knocked at the window to his right.The passenger door rose.The agent raised his eyes to see the face of the man he had pursued for weeks: the billionaire inventor who planned to blow up the Earth, once he shepherded all the most cultured and valuable people off of it."Musk," Bond spat.He sat up, maintaining a defiant air of dignity, despite his raging headache.Elon Musk grinned back at him.He swung open the door.Behind him stood a wall of armed henchmen, their fingers poised over triggers.He waved a dismissive hand to him and relaxed.Musk relaxed into the car beside him and patted the seat like it was his own child."This was one of the earliest ones, you know.The first cars we produced."Bond stared out the slanted window, steely-eyed and silent.He wriggled the fingers of his left hand out of his bulky glove one by one."It's a good send-off.Symbolic.People love a good symbol."He looked Bond over and patted his knee."You're integral, you see.I couldn't have done this without you.""Why are you doing this?"Bond sighed.His breath pearled in little beads of condensation down his visor."It's simple, Mr.Bond.I very much prefer you dead.And I would prefer to ensure no one can come looking for clues."His left hand came free of the glove.The suit was thick enough that it more or less held its shape as he snaked his arm slowly, tenuously, out of the sleeve of his suit."What is it you plan to do, then?"Bond bit his lip, hard.This was his safest strategy.The best way to steal every spare second he needed."I think it's rather self-explanatory, Mr.Bond.Your suit"--he rapped Bond's helmet with his fist--"has a built-in radio.I've strapped you here to drive my car on its final journey."He spread his hands upward, and the ceiling panels opened overhead to a sky of smoke and stars."You'll be my Starman.I'll launch you into space.This suit, lovely as it looks, is not as airtight as it could be.It was designed for a dummy, you see.You'll have to do, for now."Bond growled through his teeth, "Damn it, Musk--"

But Elon Musk carried on as if he did not hear, "Don't try to hold your breath, Mr.Bond; your lungs will only explode.And the last thing you'll hear before shattering through our stratosphere and dying alone in the cold perfect vacuum of space... will be Earth.Cheering as you go."He had his arm bent as far it could go without bulging in the suit.Did not so much as look toward Elon Musk."That's the plan, then?"he asked, solemnly."It appears so."Elon Musk smiled up at the stars."You'll be flying straight to hell at eleven kilometers a second, buddy."He slapped Bond's chest and laughed like they were old friends."And we were just getting to know each other."Bond yanked his arm out of his suit, delved into his jacket pocket for his pen.An innocent little thing, the metal battered and bruised, the ink dry.No one would think to remove it when they patted him down.Musk laughed."It's admirable, but don't think you can escape, Mister--"

He never got the chance to finish.James Bond depressed the tip of his pen.A burst of red light ate through the hide of his suit and sheared the windshield overhead in two.Musk staggered backward and shrieked, "*Shoot* him!Shoot him, you stupid bastards!"The men surged forward.Bond leapt out of the spacesuit and bolted like a rabbit out of his seat.He still wore his suit, albeit wrinkled, and his pocket square gone.They had taken his gun, so Bond dove behind the car and raised his pen.Calculated to himself how much mortal damage it could really carry out.He smirked.Now seemed as good a time as any to find out.***


James Bond *usually* murders everyone in the room with a laser at the end of a movie right?

As suddenly as they flicked off, the lights turned back on again.Or at least, it felt that way.As if the lights of my mind had been shuttered off and then on again by the huge hand of a god.I froze there.I did my best not to look surprised.I just kept staring ahead at the blurry grey wall of my apartment, trying to make sense of what I was seeing.Of the fact that I *was* seeing.No one had seen anything in over two years.Not that I could ever see well.My vision was even worse than normal, a milky blur filtering out the world.Maybe I was dying.Maybe this was one last vivid, terrific hallucination of the world as it used to be.My eyes burned like I'd fallen asleep with my contacts in, a feeling I hadn't had to worry about since the day I woke up just as blind as the rest of the world.I reached up and rubbed hard at them until the fog cleared.There was a handwritten note there above my television.A careful little army of letters, marching forward.I leapt off the couch and beelined toward it, until my nose was nearly touching the drywall.Close enough to be able to read for the first time since the Blinding.The message said, in a stranger's handwriting, DON'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE.A dark hand coiled around my spine.I knew exactly who they meant.There was only one class of people who escaped unscathed during the Blinding.They were the very same who installed the radio in my wall, who kept all of human society going.Only us fully biological humans lost our ability to see.My stare darted to the radio, still humming away in its slot on the wall.The radio had a single  black dial, a speaker, and a shiny black circle I had never been able to see before.The government had subsidized these devices as a way to help us all adjust to the new change of waking up suddenly and horribly blind.The radio spun out some light oldies tune.How long had it noticed?Had it yet noticed?Would *they* notice?I spun away from the wall and pawed around on the floor, pretending to look for something I dropped.I tried to keep my stare blank, unfocused, but in the corner of my eye, I watched that radio.I watched that strange, shiny black circle I had never seen before.I felt foolish and stupid, kneeling there on the floor, doing my best to pretend to be blind.I should be running cheering down the street.I should be going to the nearest hospital to figure out what the hell I did that no one else could do.But then another set of letters caught my eye.There, in black marker on the inner leg of my coffee table.Now I didn't have the room in my mind to think about danger or consequences.I stood up on trembling legs, and I turned my head to look boldly all around my apartment.Every wall carried words.Some of them looked like they had been scrubbed and painted over, random patches of mismatching grey paint here or there.Over and over, every surface of my apartment screamed at me: DON'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE.A knock rattled my front door.I snapped my head toward it, then quickly away again.I tried my best to remember what it felt like *not* to see.How I held my head.Whether I kept my eyes open or shut or half-lidded, almost dead-eyed.Then I paused there, opening and closing my fists at my side.I did my best to gather what information I knew.I knew I was the first living, breathing human to see in over two years.I knew the shock on my face must have given me away by now."Ma'am," a robotic voice intoned at the door."Please do me the courtesy of opening up."And whoever was on the other side of my door, they sure as hell weren't human.Not fully.And something told me they weren't here to help.***

***The Blood of Angry Men***

**Part 1**


All us helpless billions watch on our little glowing rectangles as the human race dies in droves.They fall screaming, choking, burning.The internets bad in the house, so me and my brother and sisters hunker on the steps of the chicken coop to see it.Together we watch the end of the world.Our breath clouds and storms around us.But we do not notice the cold.Our hearts and bones are lead.My siblings dont make a sound.I look between the three of them and the black, faultless sky.I wonder if the afterlife looks like night, or if just looks like nothing.I wonder if Ill find out soon.Somewhere far away, death shrieks scarlet overhead.Ships with roving eyes swarm the sky like an army of locusts.Bodies, whole and unwhole, strewn out one atop the other, abandoned where they fell.Entire skyscrapers collapse like dominoes.News anchors weep, openly, if theyre on the air at all.My sister flicks restlessly through live streams, unable to pick which tragedy to behold.We crowd my oldest sisters phone, barely able to watch yet unable to look away.She stops at the live press conference from the president.His voice is grave and hollow; he speaks to us from a dark room in some bunker somewhere.He says, at this point we have little hope.We will defend ourselves to the end, but tonight, please, stay inside, stay with your loved ones

My brother Aaron has his head between his knees.When we were kids he ran screaming after the cougar that took his puppy.(Aaron didn't catch it.)I never believed fear was an emotion he had.Turn that shit off, he gasps.Ignoring the aliens invading our fucking planet wont make them go away, Maya snaps but she switches to Facebook.Not that any of her friends would have time to post *oh shit Im dying*, anyway.Out here, under the unblinking stars, surrounded by a chorus of crickets and coyote, I cant fathom what waits out there.Someone has to tell Papa, Jackie murmurs.She is my twin, but you cant tell.People always seem disappointed that theres such a thing as non-identical twin sisters.Youll just scare him. Maya, the oldest, has always been the unofficial boss of all of us.She made it official when Dad started mistaking her for our mother and trying to scramble uncracked eggs.He deserves to know, she insists.If they come here, Maya says through her teeth, were not getting a panicked old man into the truck without hurting someone, alright? Her words hang frozen for a moment.Do you think theyll come out here? I whisper.I am the youngest by eight minutes, and I am good at the part.No, says Jackie, quickly.Were in the middle of nowhere.

Aaron pulls his beanie over his eyes.I wouldnt rule it out, Jack.

Maya gasps into her fingers.Oh, god, theyre in Spokane.

Bile shoots up my throat.Thats barely a hundred miles from here.Not even a particularly large city.I wonder if theyre hunting us one by one.Like rabbits.Shit, is that Maddies? Aaron snatches the phone from her hands.I lean over his shoulder to see.My sisters friend has pressed her phone lens to the window of her dorm room.In the background, she speaks in rapid, panicked whispers with her roommate.Outside her window mortars plummet in blue and yellow streaks, big as bowling balls.I hear her cry, Are they bombing us? as the first one connects.It blooms soundlessly, a pale yellow locus, and then the power of it explodes outward.It takes Maddie maybe six seconds to die.She has enough time to say, I need to call my mom, as the wall of smoke and debris rushes toward her like a sulfurous tsunami.The window shatters.The video goes black.I dont even realize what Ive seen until Maya starts bawling into her hands.A strange fire tingles in my palms, my belly.I feel the urge to move.To rise and fight.We have to do *something*, I say.Aaron looks at me like Im an idiot.Like what?

My fingers dance against the leg of my jeans.I know I should be scared as hell, but something in me is restless.Hungry for something very old, and long-forgotten.I stand up and face my siblings.I look them over carefully, in case this is the last time I see them.We will not just watch. I point at the house.We wont just let them kill everything and everyone and just stand here and *watch*.

Just south of us, down beyond the hide of the mountain, the sky turns red with fire.Tears stream down my brothers cheeks.I cant believe this is fucking it.

I shake my head, insistently.Insanely.I dont know why, but I cant accept that this *is* it.That this is truly how we fall.I ball my fists up at my sides.A furious heat snaps at the bars of my ribs, yearning to set on those who dared attack our home, of all places.Our dad, of all people.I let the hate and heat fill me.Flame chases down my forearm, over my knuckles.The white hot of anger.My fist is a coal and my flesh is carved from the mountain, and I will destroy anything that threatens the ones I love.Avis, my brother says, oddly calm, "why is your hand glowing?"I look at my palm and grin.The fire finds my belly now.The chaos delights some new-awoken part of me that I had never known I possessed.It is like catching my reflection in an angle I have never seen before.I am myself, but different.I think... I laugh, despite the clouds of smoke rising from town.It rises out of me like a bird.I have never felt smaller or stronger.I think I did it on purpose.

***


Maya drives me because she won't let me leave by myself.Aaron stays back with Dad, probably to watch DVR'd game shows with him and pretend everything is fine.Jackie lies in the backseat and lets out this low, constant groan of pure horror until Maya shrieks at her to shut up.The truck flies down the mountain, towards the billowing columns of ash and fire.I stare at my palms, which well with blue fire like water.It licks down my hands and pools on the floor mats, where it vanishes like steam."Can you put that out or something?It's freaky.""I don't know if I can get it back," I say, truthfully."I don't even know why it's happening.""Goddamn alien radiation," my sister mutters under her breath, like she has any real clue what's going on."That's the only thing that makes sense."Maya takes the corner by the Hendersons' farm too fast.The tires skid and shriek but just manage to cling onto the road.We keep going."I think we have to stop hoping for things to make sense," I murmur.We are silent for the rest of the drive down the mountain.The burning thing in me paces like a fox.I want to feed it flesh and bone.If the aliens are even like us.If they're just a little fire of a soul trapped in a suit of meat.But the more we drive the stronger I feel.The hotter the fire in me.When we make it to the base of the mountain, a row of fire trucks from the reservation streaks past us on the freeway, sirens blaring.I want to tell them to turn around, that they should be getting people out who still have time to run, not throwing themselves into the chaos like a sacrifice.Like we're going to do.Beyond the lake, the city is flames.The lakeside resort burns, a stalwart skeleton.Even the boats are burning.Rotten orange clouds choke the sky.Ships weave in and out of the gloom, dropping bright streaking bombs that fall glittering like jewels.For a moment we just sit, truck running, staring."They won't find us at home," Jackie says."There won't be a home anymore if they burn the damn forest down."I scowl out the windshield."It's okay.I can walk from here."Maya shakes her head."It's five miles at least, Av.""It's a good night for a walk."My sister presses her forehead against the steering wheel and breathes hard through her nose.Then she turns on her turn signal--that's what kind of person my sister Maya is; she uses her turn signal even during intergalactic genocide--and heads after the firetrucks.Toward town."I love you," she says without looking at me."But I'm gonna be real pissed if you get us killed."***

The immortals are crumbling like dry leaves.I watch one as I leave Marge's Cafe with my usual paper cup of coffee.There is a woman standing on the opposite street corner in a trench coat, her hair sleek black, her face as faultless as fine china.And all it takes is a harsh wind.She falls away in tiny pieces.Her hands claw helplessly at her disintegrating belly with fingers whose flesh sloughes off in sheets like wet paper.She reaches for her face, but then that too clouds up into dust and is gone.Her scream starts and dies in her throat.And just like that, she smacks down like a broken puppet.A near-instant death, and still it doesn't seem fast enough.Her scream keeps echoing in the back of my mind.I think it will always be there, waiting for me, when the world grows quiet enough for me to hear her once more.Like any decent human would, I stick around for EMS.I call and call, but I can't get through to 911.Someone happening by stops over the body, kicking up clouds of this woman's dust.The woman looks to be my age, one of the lost, one of the few humans left doomed to die.She sighs through her teeth."Bad luck, the lot of them."I stare at her."What do you mean?""Turns out us Lost will be last after all."She winks, like we share a kind of secret just by being born on the wrong side of the cut-off for immortality.As if there's any real camaraderie in our Lost Generation."The immortals are all just... vanishing.It's on the news, dearie."And then she keeps on walking, as though we were only chatting about the weather.It's early still.The cool morning air is so placid and peaceful, her words impossible on a morning as bright and sunny as this.As if death could not happen under such a perfect blue sky.I run to the car.It has been a while, since I ran.Decades, at least.My wife still runs.She's always teasing me, calls me an old man as she pecks a good morning kiss to my lips.Slaps my aching knees and says, "That's your penance for being born too early."And I always laugh at her and say, "Hey, I know I won't be the one dying alone."Half a joke, really.Always dancing around the inevitable and morbid reality: I would end, and she would keep on going.With any luck, it would be forever.We had both made our peace with that.The radio is buzzing, mad.It's already all over the news.There's some scientist babbling about dew point, the relative wetness of the air."As the world gets hotter and hotter, and the air gets drier and drier, it appears that the cells lose their stability and their ability to maintain struc--"

I flip the radio off.And I drive like hell.Panic drives me forward like a thing possessed.I throw my coffee out the window and veer through still-empty streets back to my home, where my wife should still be lying in bed, just about to roll up and face the dawn.She will open the window and listen to the birds convince her to rise and make a cup of tea.In my mind, she looks as lovely as the day we married.She makes the deep ruts of my skin seem like valleys, but she still palms my cheeks in her hands and tells me every day, *I love you, Mr. Weston,* and I smile back and say, *I don't know why, Mrs.Weston.*

But when I get there, the window is shut.The bed is as empty as the rest of the house.I call and call and scream for her, but the house answers back with nothing but silence.So I go to the bed where this morning she lay curled like a question mark beside me.I had kissed her shoulder and slipped out as soundlessly as an eighty-year-old-man wearing every weight of his age could hope.I lift back the blanket.There awaits me only bones and so much ash.I try to scoop her up in my palms but she is nothing but wind and air.And I am suddenly, impossibly alone.***

George got a call from Martha at Bloomsbury only two days after he turned in the final manuscript of *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, which Martin advised calling *Harry Potter and the Dawn of Night*, mostly due to how he had written it."Hullo, Martha," he said."Hi, George."Her tone was Splenda-sweet, and George knew instantly something was off."Oh, you don't like the book.""It's not that--"

"Fantastic.I take all this valuable time off working on book six, only for you people to turn around and tell me it's garbage."He had been making some scrambled eggs.He slammed the bowl down on the counter."I can't wrangle with you wardens of art at the moment.I understand I wrote something perhaps more complicated ethically than Jo would have, but I think she'd find the tone really matches how her characters have matured into adulthood.""I agree with you in spirit," the editor said, carefully."However, do you believe it was necessary to have a Slytherin student effectively addicted to killing?""No battle is fun without a blood-monger.""Well, I don't think our book's fan base will be invigorated to learn that Hermione is gutted by a brand new character when she goes to find Ron and is left to die.Or that when Ron found her the new student--" she paused, apparently to find the right line "'spilled open Ron's jugular in a thick spray of arterial scarlet', nor that Ron then 'collapsed, reaching for Hermione's still fingers, but not quite able to reach.They lay that way until the staff began the grim job of rounding up bodies, in the morning.'I mean, these are two of the primary characters.They just...died.""As people do," George said, sagely."Listen.Today I would really like you to review your draft and reconsider what points you could revise."George scoffed, offended, but the editor continued relentlessly, "These people aren't wanting to read a George R.R.Martin book, you know?They're hoping for a sweet and wholesome conclusion where Harry Potter's friends aren't murdered by a power-hungry sociopath.Additionally, since this is technically a children's book, I think we'll need to remove both sex scenes.""Both?""Both, George.""Can I at least get a fade to black?"he asked, even though those were super lame and the domain of cop-out writers.No.George did not flinch when it came to life's many and varied fluids."Probably not."There was still a smile in her voice."Okay, George?Does that all make sense?""I suppose."He stirred his scrambled eggs viciously."I don't see why you would ask me to write it if you didn't want it to *sound* like me.""Surely you can try a voice switch.Pretend you're an actor putting on a new accent."George R.R.Martin hung up the phone and growled to his empty kitchen, "I don't *use* accents."***
George skimmed a few pages of the draft edits he had received from Martha.He had cut out perhaps too much of the boring magic bits, except to give that Longbottom boy a flaming sword, but he needed a good redemption moment, George felt.>Neville stood on the edge of the wall, staring grimly at the roving army of the dead ten thousand strong ***(really??there's no legion of the undead in HP, George!(well, technically there is the Inferi army, but I know you had NO idea they existed, so you can't pretend that's what you meant.))*** below him, like a boiling sea of ants, just as relentless and hungry for war.He unsheathed his sword called Death Eaters' Bane, its pommel a snarling lion with red-jeweled eyes.It had been his father's sword.Perhaps if Frank Longbottom had been carrying Bane when the Lestrange fell upon him that bleak night, he would be alive to pass his sword onto his son himself.>
>***I appreciate the tension but we said you can't write your own backstory.You get a little carried away.***

The next passage was the only critique George agreed with.>Dumbledore turned his wand on one of the Slytherin students, who had just sent a first-year Hufflepuff, running for her life, into an early grave.The raw heat of his anger locked the child in place and he raised his wand, eyes red and mad with fury, like a bear who's just seen its cub murdered.>
>"That," Dumbledore murmured, "was a very poor choice indeed.">
>He performed a rending curse and the boy split open and scattered across in the dining hall, his bones clinking dully against the stone.>
>The headmaster hurried away to the rest of the battle.This time Martha's note read simply: ***DUMBLEDORE DIED ALREADY.You can't bring him back just to kill him again.And he wouldn't murder a student like that...***

"Wait," George said to himself."Really?"He double checked his notes.That seemed to be from the part Jo wrote.He always told himself he'd get around to reading that, but why bother when his publisher gave him such a good summary already.When he finished reading, most of the manuscript seemed solid.Martha, it seemed, was grossly overreacting.For example, Martha did not care for Harry removing Voldemort's head at the end.She explained that it would make more sense for his old age and the wrongness of his being to make him simply disappear.George rolled his eyes."What kids don't like a good bit of beheading?"And besides, it would be reckless to use a rule that so readily eschews physics.George was a man of realism, after all.He did not put things in books that weren't *feasible*.And then, of course, he ended with the respective love interests finally bedding.Any story about bodies and fervor must acknowledge the softer side of if.Martha had struck out the whole scene of Ginny crying over her dead brothers and then leaping into Harry's bed shortly afterward.Below it she wrote only the words, ***no no NO George.Not appropriate!***

George called Martha up when he finished reading.When she answered, wearily, he said, "What if just Ron dies?Would that be okay?""And the sex scenes."George was quiet for a long moment."*George*," she said, sternly."You promised Jo you'd write *her* book, not *your* book."He whined like a child, "Gods, you make everything so much worse," and hung up on her.When he calmed down, he would take all the good bits out of it.For now, it was time to go to his file on *The Winds of Winter* and rewrite the same sentence over and over again for a few hours.Surely that would count as progress.***
