I had Captain Invincible trapped on a steel table, held in bonds of the only rare element on Earth that could kill him.In my hands was a dagger; the blade was made of that same element....I also knew that, given enough time, he would break the table and escape...."So, Evil Overlord, what are your plans for the people of San Francisco?"Captain Invincible asked me this while I could see his hands fidgeting in the bonds I created to keep him restrained.I had to act fast: the bonds were unbreakable, but the table upon which they were fastened was not."Why would I tell you?You're going to die soon enough anyway," I replied, as I approached.I assumed his anatomy was like a human's, so his heart should be in the same place--and right where I wanted to place my dagger."But...but...but villains always monologue what they're--"

"No," I interrupted as I made my way to the table.I saw Captain Invincible begin to sweat, and his movements grow more frantic.I also heard the steel of the table start to *scrreeeech* from metal fatigue as the Captain began to work against his bonds, fueled by desperation."Look, you're about to destroy my table, and I can't have that."I placed the tip of the dagger over his chest, right at what should be his heart.He began to jerk up and down, trying to escape.His face was a mask of pure panic."Wait!Maybe I-- we can make a deal!""No deals," I replied."You die."I plunged the knife into his chest, tearing a hole in the blue of his tights.His blood welled up over the wound.For someone who was rumored to have extraterrestrial roots, his blood was the same red as mine as it poured out of his chest, powered by his faltering heart.I watched with glee as the shock registered on his face: Mouth agape, eyes wide...the man who supposedly could not be killed was now dying on my table as his life's blood changed the color of his blue tights to a deeper, redder hue, the color taking its time to crawl across the material like an approaching storm cloud of blood as it soaked the fabric.I saw him sag back, and his head loll to one side as I twisted the blade to make sure I did extra damage....I left the knife in, and went around to the other side of the steel table.I bent over, and checked under it--yep, there were tears and breaks in the steel.Another few seconds, and he could have freed himself.That would have been bad news for me; I am still an ordinary mortal.Captain Invincible could have torn the bonds free, and while encumbered with wrist and ankle bands of glowing rock that weakened him, he still could have made a formidable opponent.That just would not do.I got up, and went over to look at his face: His eyes were half-closed, his mouth slack.I reached out with my right hand, touched his neck and checked his pulse...Nothing.I pulled out a penlight similar to what doctors use, and used my left hand to pry open an eyelid.I flashed the light at one brown eye; no response from the pupil.I tried the other, with the same result....Satisfied, I left the table and whipped out my phone.I made the call:

"He's dead.""The material worked?""It did.""Good!When can we start the next phase of the plan?""When I find his brother and kill him, as well," I said as I hung up.One down, one to go.
