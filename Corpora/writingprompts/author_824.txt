It started as a small shadow on the ground that glistened and shimmered as it moved.Quickly it swelled, swirled.. pulsed.I was transfixed on the movement.My shoulder had taken the brunt of the fall but my head had hit the ground with a loud crack.I was too dazed to move... all I could do was watch.The scene played out in slow motion.I tried to concentrate.. fighting against the hazy molasses of what was certainly a concussion.They quickly grew in numberthe shadow growing as more and more spiders poured into the alley.I heard the man with the baseball bat cry out in surprise.It was a horrible scream.The scream shook in the night air.A long, high-pitched howl that quickly turned to gurgle and then suddenly cut short by... something.I could feel them now.Crawling on me.Crawling around me.Under me.I was too weak to put up any sort of fight.Soon I was floating on the rippling, swelling mass of spiders.My head was throbbing but somehow I could hear a voice.Or was I feeling it?The same phrase, over and over.Words that scratched at the inside of my head.A voice that somehow wrapped around me and held me safely, like a close hug.Warm words that lapped over me like tiny waves.It was a familiar voice, tinged with gratitude.And it was now repaying the debt.The voice repeated back to me what I had told it many times before, as I had held it softly, gently escorting it out of my house, to the hydrangea bush in the backyard.It was the last thing I heard before I lost consciousness.*today you... tomorrow me...*
