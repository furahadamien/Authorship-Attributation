"Finally!I figured it out!The answer was cabbages the entire time!"I screamed as the formula ejected itself from the printer.About a year and a half ago I was walking down the street, plastered and depressed after finding out that the Trump Administration cut my funding because Trump said "Science makes my head hurt."Well, I met a man dressed in white in an alley when I went to take a piss, he told me that he could give me all the funding I needed but I would burn for all eternity.I pondered the thought as I swayed back and forth with my man meat exposed to the man in white."Mr. Spooky man, you got a fucking deal!"I said before I emptied the contents of my stomach onto his shoes.With a snap of his fingers, a scroll formed in his hands out of fire and smoke "Sign here."The man said with a hiss, as I reached for a pen he stopped me "With your blood."And with the flick of one of his sharp nails, sliced open my palm and let the blood pool in my hand.I don't remember much after that but when I woke up, I was in the lab and a letter sat in front of me.I ripped open the envelope and scanned the letter but all it said was 'Good Luck' in red ink, at least I think it's red ink.I stood up and accessed the database on my laptop, I noticed a notification in the corner.I clicked and almost fainted when I saw the number, all it was was a sideways 8.I walked out of my lab and walked up to the secretary "Betty, who provided the new funding?"I asked, Betty read a paper "A mister Luc Ifer."I gulped and walked back to my lab "it wasn't a dream.Wait, it wasn't a dream!"I ran out and yelled to Betty "Betty, order three pounds of Hot Cheetos, 3,000 lab rats, 300 cabbages, and Berreta 92fs.I want to test a theory."*4 Hours later*


Crates of supplies were wheeled into the lab and sat down, I placed 5 rats into their cages and loaded the pistol.I took two of the cabbages into the CRISPR and broke apart the enzymes that made up the vegetable.*2 hours later*


After 2 hours of rebuilding and restructuring, I finally synthesized an injection from the Chlorophyll and crossed it with B12 and minute amounts of depleted uranium.I put the new liquid into a syringe and injected it into one of the 2 surviving lab rats out of five in the cage, not to glycerin was not an answer.I took a step back and pointed the gun at the rat with the new injection and fired, the spent shell clanged to the ground as the rat collapsed to the ground.After thirty seconds, the rat stood up and walked about like nothing happened."Yes!The answer was Cabbages the entire time!"I yelled in excitement."So that's why I'm in hell."I said as I sat at a table with Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, Fred Phelps, and Lenin.Fred raised his hand "So how did you die?"I laughed "Oh I'm not dead, you see after discovering Immortality.I decided to put my 'Doom' thesis to work and I managed to open a portal to hell.Now I come here to rub it in Satan's face.You hear that Lucy Goosey!"I yelled as I reactivated my portal, Satan sighed as he stabbed Kim Il Sun with his pitchfork.I stopped as I was about to step through the portal "Hey what do you guys think of Donald Trump?"I asked everyone within earshot."Terrible!"Stalin said as he sipped vodka with his glorious mustache."What an evil man!I mean I know I killed 6 million Jews but who knowing kills the earth?!"Hitler said

Pol Pot stayed quiet since he has no room to talk.Fred Phelps stood up and fixed his hat "I think he's doing a great job getting rid of them Mexicans and faggots!"Fred yelled, everyone stared at him, Satan unskewered Kim il sun and stabbed Fred, dunking him into a pit of lava."Hey, we may be evil but we're not fucked up."Lenin said as he high fived Karl Marx.I shook my head as I walked through the portal and closed it behind me.Alright, now to create the BFG."Betty!More Cabbages!I think I'm on to something!"
