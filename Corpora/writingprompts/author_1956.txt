The wallet sat there on the ground, not emitting any kind of "oh shit" frequency meant for those who definitely laid a bug in my credit card, as this man may have me believe, and it certainly wasn't writhing or moving around on the ground.But that was the kind of city i lived in.I look up at this smug man who has a face that would make you think he just personally saved the Queen from at least 42 elite ninja assasins."You're welcome."He tips his hat as the ash from his cigarette carelessly fall to the ground.I look up at him with surprise, of course, but not contempt.Sure, i carried it around, but all that was inside was a couple coupons, a voucher for your 11th free sub at the local stand, my ID, and $4 and... About 37 cents.No one in this neighborhood was stupid enough to carry their credit card in their wallet.Crazy people live here, people driven to insanity by crazy ex wives, prison, raising ungrateful kids, and countless other things.While not quite slums, this street was cheap to say the least.Should it have been a mugger, i would have been more angry.But it wasn't.It was Mel.Mel lived in the apartment underneath me, claiming to be some warrior against the corporations.He's an avid smoker, and a crazy person, but a bad guy.The day he got fired from his job, his girlfriend broke up with him.He decided to move out, and start a new life.Not sure when he went crazy, cause he was when i got here.So i just looked up at him and said "Mel, last week it was my head the corporations were trying to mess with my head, and now they're trying to do the same with my wallet?""You should be thankful that i'm your friend, if i weren't, they may have gotten to you by now.I don't charge, citizen, just doing my job."*sigh* "Thank you, Mel, but i can handle it next time.l, yeah?""Alright, alright.But don't come crying to me when you're brainwashed.Awh, who am i kidding, i'd save you anyway."So i walked by him, went home, ate my food, and went to sleep, grateful for the lack of corporation brainwashing in my life.
