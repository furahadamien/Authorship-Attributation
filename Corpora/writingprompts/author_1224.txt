Transhout
I smile around another bite of peppermint bark, pausing for a moment to read the prompt and a few of the responses."It feels nice that we can all come together like this, if only for a few weeks of the year."I think.Then I'm distracted by the snow that has fallen unrelentingly for the past several hours.I'm very much not looking forward to shoveling it before leaving for dinner at my great grandmother's.But for now, I can rest and enjoy the warmth inside.I'm not left at peace long though.Shortly a clatter in the kitchen alerts me to the fact that at least one of the cats have discovered the icing on the cinnamon rolls sitting on the counter.I dont want to get up yet.Ah, what the hell.Merry Christmas Eddie.
