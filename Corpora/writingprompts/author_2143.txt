In a construction site in Dubai I walk to an area that has not been welded properly.Damn I think to myself.I look at the other welder indulging in her 20th beer of the hour in a corner with all of her friends.I put down my mask and switch on my blowtorch.I weld on top of the botched job.The sparks fly everywhere and almost hit one of the other welder's friends."Damn it Jack.Pay attention to where everyone is before you switch on that damn heat torch."says the site idiot.I saw him run towards my torch when he thought I wasn't looking.He was hoping for a chance to get paid leave and get me fired.Of course, if I get fired then he can slide into the other welder's pants.But, unlike her, I am a master at my job and know what I'm doing.I stand up, push him away from my path and silently stomp towards Jane, the welder.I snatch her 21st beer from her and chug it in a second to her dismay and her friend's anger.I smash the can on my mask which I moved to the top of my head.It is so much more soothing when a beer is drunk under the shadow of my welding.**"Times Up"** booms the voice of the construction site manager.Making sure all of his workers know that they won't get any more money from staying longer.This is mostly directed at One-eyed Mark who stayed here too long and lost an eye from a faulty drill.The contraction company lost a fortune from the following lawsuit but Mark continued working here.Nobody knows why, even himself.&#x200B;

Everyone files out from fear of losing one of their organs to a faulty piece of machinery.I go into my car, a rust piece of metal so old that the beer I drank could sell for more.I twist the key in the ignition for the fifth time before the hunk of junk actually decides to switch on.I look up to see Mark get in a limo, he would get a Ferrari if he could actually drive it without crashing.&#x200B;

I drive through my usual road, time seeming to slow as I drive through the forest where my sick father first taught me how to weld 2 dead animals together.As I am reminiscing in my memories I don't realize that there is someone walking across the road until it is too late.Usually my headlights are off because no sane person would walk in this forest alone.&#x200B;

I crash into the man with my car, crumpling the front.I run out hoping to god that the wheels don't have any blood on them.The life of the man in front of me is irrelevant, my emotions were long gone from my hellish childhood.As I look at my wheels I mentally gasp in shock as not a speck of blood goes near them.I look to the dying man and see that his blood is slowly evaporating and going into where my wretched heart is.I scramble to my feet as I see clouds circling in the empty sky.I try to run from the crime scene but the clouds form into a face from who's mouth a lightning strike strikes me directly.My heart expands in my chest and I cry for the first time in 20 years as I booming voice 5 times as loud as the construction site manager that says, "**THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE JACK OF ALL TRADES"**.I can feel new information loading into my head and I feel like I am hallucinating as I see pipes everywhere, I think back at all the times I saw faulty piece of plumbing and immediately know what was wrong and realize all plumbers are just scammers.I black out.&#x200B;

I wake up in a house that is toasty.I jump out from the traumatizing event and see paintings throughout the large hall with names starting with Jack.I look at a painting with a face that look like the person I killed with a red X on it.Turn around to a large painting with my face on it and see a man painting and X on it.
