With a growing curiosity, I fell back into my chair and looked at the book in front of me."Lisa Matherson.The Autobiography."Nope.Definitely never heard her name before.The contents displayed three chapters.Unreal.A chapter I can kinda understand, but two hundred pages?Insane."To James.My sun and my moon," it read.In the form of a diary she wrote, pages and pages that painted a vivid picture.Hours passed and still I read.When I finally stood, my knees were weak.Memories repressed had flooded back.Guilt and sadness overcame me.It was all true.Outside, Doctor Andrew Lansky observed his patient through the safety of a one way mirror.He watched in fascination as the patient, shackled and constrained, writhed in emotional pain, the picture of the deceased woman forgotten on the floor."I hope this brings you some closure, Mr Matherson," he said softly, peering at the man over his glasses.James Matherson said nothing.A solitary tear rolled down his cheek, and he turned to leave.
