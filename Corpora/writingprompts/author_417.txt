The war was a mistake.Like so many great squabbles in history, WWIII began over a misunderstanding.The US missile detection systems picked up a surprising large nuclear salvo from The People's Republic of Korea.The US retaliated with overwhelming force.China backed their ally and responded as expected.People expect nukes to end wars, but this time they started them.The world burned and bled for six long years.Finally, a meeting was held.Some say one side called it, and some say the other did.This meeting brought forth The Closed Doors treaty.For fifty years, every nation would tend to its own people, rebuilding what once was in theory.However, this was not the first conference that had been held.The one before excluded the United States of America.The world believed that the mistake was just an excuse to attack, given the line of unstable presidents leading up to the first strike.For fifty years, the world would be dark and silent to the US only.No communication would be had with any terrestrial nation.The world didn't expect the US to communicate with an extraterrestrial nation.They presented themselves as the strong but peaceful world leaders they once were so long ago.The outsiders believed them and taught them.They traded rare metals and strange chemical compounds for things abundant on earth like iron and silica.The Americans were given future-changing sciences and technology for a few tons of dirt.Up until the communication wall finally fell, the rest of the world was arrogant in their progress.They had cured diseases, established cheap, renewable energy systems.There was progress into hyper-conductive materials and faster-than-light travel.The world was in anxious peace leading up to the end of the fifty year period.When the wall did come down, the world held a reintroduction convention.The American representative was told to quietly listen to every world leader's advancements and progress, as if to show them how far behind they were and how it was their own fault.Leader after leader sneered as they delivered their presentation.The convention lasted eleven days.On the start of the twelfth, the American was given his chance to speak, much to the disdain of the rest of the world.He said no words.Instead he took a small device from his pocket, pressed a few buttons on it, and instantly beamed a presentation all of the US' progress into the minds of the other leaders.and the world wept
