Dave went about his day, same as any other, even with all the others making some hullabaloo about the shake up in the rankings.He just did what he's done for the past two years; Work in the morning, clock out around six and  crack open a cold one with the boys, then home to help the kids with their homework.He fumbled with the keys to let himself inside, a little smile on his face, he knew what would happen next.Little Janie would be waiting.Like clock work she tackled at his legs as soon as he was through the door and let out a high pitched squeel that signaled he was home.Their mothers voice came from the kitchen, "You're home!Great!You have some mail in here!Looks important."Her voice betrayed her excitement.He never got important mail, bills yes, important things?Not once.He hefted Janie onto his shoulders and walked into the kitchen like a giant with exaggerated steps, gave her mother a quick kiss, and asked"Where's Tom?"Before picking up a thin package, too big for a Bill, too small to be a new truck he thought.She nodded her head to the living room, "he was doing math homework, he could use a little help, but will be let me?Oh no, has to be Dave.You help a little too well I think."She gave him a grin and took Janie from his shoulders."Go help him and take that-" she motioned to the mail, "-with you.He has something to give you."Dave just shook his head, and started opening it up on his way to the living room, "Hey Tommy boy, what's up?"He asked as he walked in, eight year old Tom sat on the floor, books in front of him, and pencil in his mouth as he thought.A weird box off to his right.At the sound of Daves voice Tom was up, that little box in his hand, "Did you get it?Did you?"He motioned at the little letter in Daves hand, noticing it's still not open."Hurrrry and open it!"Tom urged, as he started opening the little box.David  couldn't help but smile, the little guy hasn't been so excited since the wedding, he couldn't help but wonder what was in there."Alright, Alright, give me just a sec and I'll get it open here."He started to open it and pull out documents, state seals galore.It clicked for him then.He looked up and saw their mother standing in the doorway, that sparkle in her eyes made even shinier with a few tears as she put Janie down.Pursing his lips to keep his composure, Dave looked over at Tom, who had managed to open his little box.He was holding up a brand new mug.It had "#___ Dad."Tom smiled and tried to hand the cup to him, "it finally came dad.You can have your rank!"Dave forced a smile, and blinked back a few tears of his own, taking the mug and setting it down on the table he paid it no attention to the big red #3 that appeared on it."I didn't do it for a mug buddy."He pulled Tom in for a hug, and little Janie scrambled in as well.(Did this from my phone so here's hoping i didn't fat finger too many words.)
