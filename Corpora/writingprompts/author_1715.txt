Earthless' world was a world well defined by a minimum

of terrestrial rocks, boulders, solids and minerals

And everything was kept spherical in hydrostatic equilibrium

But fluid patterns of life was possible, held together by magic tick intervals.Waterless world was poorly defined still

With no liquid at all in a sea, lake, or well

But life was still possible, just a different sort

Everything there was an electric robot.Fireless world was cold and dark, no star,

To light up the void and bring structure afar.But despite this heat prevailed at a minimum,

Heated by our friend compression and equilibrium.Aetherless world was filled to the top

With matter and solids with not a single thought

to the giant voids of the other universe's space,

And the material of Helium which fills up the place.Finally Magicless world was the one of confusion,

And seemed to have no creation story of reason,

All was deterministic and natural,

One wonders if souls could exist truly with this world's set of behaviourals.
