"If you love me so much why do you try to control what I see and read about, reddit?"I wondered.It was like being with an abusive, drunken father who kept telling you he loved you but in between all the slobber was the underlying evil.Too young to leave, I dealt with it until I was able to find another home.one where I could blossom into the man I wanted to become.The minute I was mature enough to handle words I didnt like I went to voat.And I lived happily ever after.
