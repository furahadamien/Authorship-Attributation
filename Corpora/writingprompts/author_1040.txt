It sure is peaceful here.Sounds of harps and choirs of angels singing with accolades to a higher power and lions lying down with the lambs and doves carrying the branches of olive trees.Peaceful.Crazy peaceful.Too damn peaceful.I feel a knife-like pain.It resonates through my being.My soul, it is on fire.What is this pain?It seems so familiar, yet I have no memories of the before.I have always been here, have I not?Always I have been here, Mate.My winged arm swings to clap a hand over my mouth.Mate.So familiar.Mate...Friend.Memories of a friend.Memories of a family.A daughter.A son.Did they follow in my footsteps?My heart stabs with pain.A sharp barb puncturing and ripping across my skin, laying my heart muscle bare."Hang on.Hang on for your family," a plea from my Mate.The memory floods back in a mighty surge.A monster with a tail.A tail with a barb.A barb ripping open a heart.Taking a life.My life.My family left behind devastated by this loss.I will have my revenge on this stingray demon.I will shed my wings and drop into the abyss.Willingly I leave this paradise in search of a barb-tailed mammoth smooth in the water.Now smooth in the lake of fire.Who is with me?Who will be my cameraman?
