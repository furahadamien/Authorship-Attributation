As I approached the bench, still wearing my bloodstained apron and Smashburger uniform, the imposing and powerful Norse God stares down upon me.His advisors, left and right of him, pinched their gazes all directly before me.MORTAL, he said in a voice that vaguely resembled thunder, YOU STAND BEFORE US, A COURT OF WARRIORS, AS A FUCKING FRY COOK.EXPLAIN WHY YOU BELONG AMONGST US.

They living often claim that the other side of things, things being the afterlife, lend perspective.Unfortunately, their only source of people they divulge this from is the dying, the dying having lived a full and fruitful life.I, on the other hand, am a 22 year old fry cook from Jersey.I had no tidbits of wisdom that could possibly help me in this situation.Nonetheless, what I lacked in wisdom I had surplus in nerves, so I began my arguments.Sir, I calmly began, I am to understand that in order to enter this realm of the afterlife, I was to have died with weapon in hand.

CORRECT YOU ARE MORTAL.

I have reason to claim that I died with a weapon in my hand.

A SPATULA?A SPATULA?!?!?

As he bellowed, clouds overcame the high ceiling court room.Rain fell upon the stone floor and the high bench of Odin and his council.It seemed evermore imposing and I nonetheless cleared my throat and drew breath deep into my chest.I HAVE KILLED COUNTLESS MEN WITH MY SPATULA, AND HERE IS HOW I DID IT. I began, desperately trying to find the timbre these people seemed to speak in.WITH THIS SPATULA I CREATED THE INEVITABLE DEATH OF MY CUSTOMERS.MUCH LIKE THE BOW IS TO THE ARROW, MY SPATULA WAS TO THE BURGER.I BRED THEIR OBESITY EVERY DAY.THEY CAME UPON ME, THEIR HUNGER CLOUDING THEIR JUDGEMENT, AND EVERY DAY I CHIPPED AWAY AT THEIR STRENGTH.

A murmur came from high up on the bench, whispers of interest, confusion... wonder, even.I MADE THEM FAT- MADE THEM WEAK.I POISONED THEIR INSIDES WITH SATURATED FATS AND SALT UNTIL ONE DAY, THEY FELL: DEAD OF A HEART ATTACK.THOSE WHO DID NOT WERE SUBJECTED TO DISEASES OF THE FLESH THAT WOULD LEAD TO THEIR DEATHS.DIABETES, CHOLESTEROL, OBESITY: THE VERY POISONS WITH WHICH MY ARROWS WERE DIPPED.

STOOOOOOOP! A roar of thunder rolled down from the top of the bench.NO! I replied, shocking myself at my own impudence.I HAVE KILLED MORE THAN MOST WARRIORS OF MY LAND.THE BLOOD ON MY HANDS CANNOT BE IGNORED.GIVE ME MY WARRIORS AFTERLIFE.

THEN HOW.... Odin said, considerably calmer than before, DID YOU DIE?

I looked up sheepishly at the advisory board and the big man himself and said, at normal volume,
The Smashburger was being held up.I tried to bum-rush the robber and he shot me dead.It was my chance to be a hero and despite the fact that I knew it would probably kill me, I needed to prove that in some way, I was valiant enough to stand up to a bad man for the sake of good people being terrorized.My spatula was the closest thing I had to use to fight, and even if it meant having to bludgeon him into submission with a flimsy, malleable tool, it was enough for me to find the courage to stand up against the proverbial sea of troubles.

The room fell silent.The rain cleared.Odin turned to his left and right and discussed for some considerable time and discussed the situation with his advisors.Suddenly Odins voice redirected to me and proclaimed, RETURN TO YOUR ACCOMMODATIONS AS WE DETERMINE YOUR SITUATION. 

And so I went.That was a week ago.This morning a guard of Odin came to my temporary afterlife condo and told me tomorrow I was to enter Valhalla.I cant believe that worked.
