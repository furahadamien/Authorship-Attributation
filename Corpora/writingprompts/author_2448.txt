There must have been a party downstairs; the parking garage was unusually full.Someone was in my spot.Just my luck.I get called in early, then asked to pull an extra shift.I don't think I saw the sun today.I get 9 hours before my next shift starts.I'm done now.The problems of tomorrow can wait until tomorrow.I've got a date with Bob Ross and a poorly made mojito.As I walk to my door, I can hear voices inside.I try the door handle; it's open.I throw myself in.A large man stands before me, startled.It was reflex at this point.I draw my concealed handgun and send a double tap through his chest.He falls like a man who's been shot in the chest.I clicked the lights on to get a better look.He lay semi-conscious, gurgling on his own blood.He was no threat to anyone anymore.As I look around the room, I find more questions than answers.Why would he break into my apartment just to put up pictures of his family?
