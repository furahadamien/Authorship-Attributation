I reply, to all of those for whom this is a dark time of year: those surrounded by loss of loved ones, by confrontation, by memories if neglect, by dismissal and rejection from family, by heartache that the site of a Christmas tree brings back strong, by those who do not understand and with whom you smile along, nibbling, nibbling, nibbling.To those for whom this is a season of torment, sadness, forced or chosen solitude, moving on, transcending a past where unhappiness, misguidedness, and pain came down the chimney with Santa, a lie himself embodying the lies that were then and persist now.To y'all, I see you.xoxo
