I wake to the whisper of a rumbling gate.The dark, obsidian doors reveal a thickening pillar of light, and I watch in the shadows for the silhouette of a figure to appear.What was it the voices had said?One I'd been kindest to.Cruelest.One I'd saved.And one I'd doomed.The figure walks out, the doors shut.The light is gone.My breath catches.A new light emerges.*Grace.*

Alone she could light up the room.I watch as she walks towards me, her form tall and full of grace and poise.That easy smile breaks on her face and for a moment I remember.Distant echoes.The music from lives that intertwined seamlessly.*Grace.The only woman I ever loved.*

I stumble to my feet, my movements as awkward as a newborn babe's.She's closer now.10?No, 5 meters away.The gap between us fades, and the strain of faint music enters.*Grace.The woman I lost 15 years ago.*

I say no words.Neither does she.We stand there, face to face, my eyes memorizing each of her features.She takes my hand, and slides her thin body close to mine, the way a bow touches a violin.I hold her.And before I even know it, we move.The music rises and sweeps us into a slow dance.The room spins, and somehow unfolds like a box opening, and the room cannot contain us and all at once we are bursting and flying among the sparkling sky, a couple dancing among the stars."So this is nice."My voice manages not to break.She smiles, her green eyes glowing brightly in the dark."You always did say you wanted to take me to someplace gorgeous."She teases."I guess this counts."I smile, but my insides flutter.That's right.I'd always wanted to take her someplace amazing.*Always wanted to.Always wanted to...*

The slightest pause, a burr in the flow of our dance as I flinch.Memories pop and spill like a bottle of uncorked wine.*Nights in the hospital.Holding your hand.Looking up.Wishing I had more time with you.Wishing I'd kept my promise.*

I smile, but she shakes her head."I know you better than that, love."She says."You always did have a nasty habit of pretending you were fine.""I..." I try.The words are raw.Laced with subtle pain, words that cut through my heart as I pronounce them."I wish I'd treated you better.I wish I'd taken you to more places.I wish I'd hugged you more."The music halts.The dance ends.The stars blink away."I wish I'd loved you more."She blurs within my vision, and it takes me a second to realise its because of my tears.She raises a gentle hand to my eyes, and wipes."I have never once felt unloved in my time with you, John."She says, her voice like streaming honey."Never once have i regretted being with you.My whole life all I've known from you is love and kindness."She holds my chin and gently tips my eyes to meet hers.Brown eyes with specks of golden sunshine."Maybe you couldn't take me to places like Paris or New York or Sydney or Iceland or-"

I laugh and she smiles a little.She squeezes my hand."But with you, any place is like this."The stars fall back into place.The music resumes.And we dance in the deep of the night, our heads leaned against each other, the most beautiful place and woman I've ever known.
