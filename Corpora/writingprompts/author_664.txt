Define life that is eternal   
Fingers interlaced, forehead wrinkled  
Years have passed since the Lost were condemned  
I am one of the last to fall   
  
Reflections of nature bend with the waves  
They are the only ones who will persevere   
Alone in this universe, where all else moves forth   
They are the ones that will not be saved   
  
To erase finite fears at any cost  
Our story is gifted with a beginning and an end   
Time will realize what has been done  
For who are the ones that are truly Lost?
