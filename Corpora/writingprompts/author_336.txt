**PART 1:**
My father had always been a bit of an enigma.We had little in common save for our names.He was a mild-mannered and proper Englishman who had immigrated to America from a little village the West Country.He believed with all his being in the power of an orderly queue and a proper cup of tea.But every so often when he had a few pints in him, he would wibble on about strange adventures and heroic deeds in impossible places with fanciful characters.Talking mice, a 2-headed man, poetry so awful it could kill the listener - my best friend Douglas and I teased him that he should write a book or five about it all.But we never believed a word of his tall tales.Not until the end.I was 25 when he died.It was March 11, 1977.Dad hadn't spoken in days.Doctors said his mind was gone, and his body would soon follow.As he lay gasping his final breaths, something small and yellow wriggled wetly out of his ear.It looked almost like a fish.I leant in for a closer look.For just a moment, my father became lucid again.He grasped my head in his hands."Artie, my boy," he croaked, "Always know... where your... towel is..." With one last gasp, he struck me on my ear with a surprising amount of strength.Then he slipped away and was gone.So was the fish.But from that moment on, I had the ability to speak and understand all language.Every word I ever heard or read translated itself in my mind.And every word I spoke arrived at the listener's ear in their native tongue.**PART 2:**
I sat in the cool air conditioning of the fast food restaurant, gazing out at one of the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World.It was a stark dichotomy.I had spent my entire adult life traveling all around the globe, and yet I still found it surprising to watch the modern world creep into the most ancient of sites.I found myself pondering what might have stood on this site way back when the Great Pyramid of Giza had first gone up.Thousands of years ago, a man such as myself may have eaten his meal in this same spot, awed by the view of these same pyramids.The thought made me smile.As my mind trailed off along that thought, I was interrupted by a young man bringing a tray full of enough fat, salt and refined sugar to quell my growing homesickness for a little while.Still lost in my thoughts of ancient times, I reached for my soda before he had finished setting down the tray, and a little spilled.The young man apologized profusely.His words came to me in modern English, though I knew he was speaking in his native tongue."Don't worry, my friend!"I assured the young man as he hurriedly mopped up the spill."I wasn't looking.It's my fault."He froze.His dark eyes went wide with - was it shock?Confusion?Fear?Occasionally hearing one's mother tongue appear to come so naturally from American lips seems too implausible.Occasionally I startle people."I'll finish cleaning up," I offered cheerfully, hoping he would relax.But the words had the opposite effect.They merely confirmed to his disbelieving ears that he had, in fact, heard what it should be impossible to hear.His wide eyes remained locked on the great pyramid glowing in the hot sun on the other side of the glass as he shook his head and stammered, "Khnum protect me!No one but a child of Hemiunu has spoken His sacred tongue in over 4000 years!"**PART 3:**
I used my ability to travel all around the world, learning and exploring.My gift granted me access to the most incredible locations.I had been invited to come to Egypt to decode strange writing found in a newly discovered chamber in the Great Pyramid of Giza.A couple years ago, muography scans detected a hidden chamber above Khnum Khufus tomb.At last, tiny robots had carefully drilled through a small shaft and into the mysterious big void.Cameras fed into the opening revealed writing in a language that no one had ever seen before, or so they told me.I could never tell the difference - it was all English to me!Archaeologists had dubbed the void Hemiunu's Gallery after the architect who directed the construction of the pyramid.And now in front of me was a young man who was apparently a descendant of Hemiunu himself.I was developing a sneaking suspicion the chamber was somehow connected to this young man, whose eyes were still locked upon the pyramid."It's time," he said suddenly.He tore his eyes from the pyramid and turned to face me as crumpled into the chair across from mine.**PART 4:**
I had only had my gift a few years when Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark came out.But from that day forward, archaeology held a special place in my heart.And now here I was, about to helping explore the first new chamber to have been discovered in the pyramid since the middle ages.I was so excited, my heart was beating as fast as the Kali Ma human sacrifice in Temple of Doom. I glanced at Buneb, the young man from the restaurant.I had managed to get him hired on as my assistant.Being a septuagenarian, no one questioned my request for a young strong man to lean on across the sand and rocks.Are you ready? Buneb smiled weakly.I was somewhat worried that he would honor this sacred ground with an offering of vomit.We gathered beneath the large white canopy pitched at the foot of the pyramid.Technicians had set up a myriad of video equipment.Buena and I were led to a seat by a large screen.We have gotten more lighting in there now, said one of the technicians.And our high-res camera has nearly reached the gallery.Youll be able to see the writing in just a moment.  She switched on the screen and hurried off to finish preparations.Come on, Phouchg.Its time, said a small high voice.It had better work this time, Loonquawl, said another equally squeaky voice.My powers of language had never extended to the animal kingdom, but no one was nearby except Buneb, who was intently watching two small white mice scurry up the pyramid.**PART 5:**
Buneb had spent his whole young life watching the Great Pyramid, as had his father before him, and his fathers father, and so on back through the millennia.He was a direct descendant of Hemiunu, he had said.According to his ancestors, the pyramid held some sort of mystical secret of the universe.And when the universe was ready, the descendants of Hemiunu must be on hand to ensure the secret was understood.Apparently Hemiunu realized the universe wouldnt be ready for quite some time, and also knew that a multi-millennial game of telephone might result in the secret becoming distorted.He tasked his offspring with ensuring the language was kept alive and intact.The screen flickered and suddenly it was filled with images.Head all the way to your right, I told the technician.Now up Yes, there -by the drawing of the   white mouse.That is the beginning.Now head straight down.It is written in columns.  Very slowly, words began to take form.I scribbled in my little notepad while Buneb muttered softly to himself.As the camera finally finished its journey around the room, I stared back at what I had written.It isnt an answer, it is a question! exclaimed Buneb.He was right.There in my notebook, scrawled in my shaky handwriting, was the ultimate question.The question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.

I have always been what you would call lucky.My luck was as plain as the number on my face.I have a whole 100 freckles.On the day I was born, Lady Luck kissed my cheek 100 times.My brother, born with 64 freckles, would tease me that most of mine were dirt or insect bites.When I slept, he would color in between sets of closely spaced freckles, to make two appear as only one.Or he would he would play connect-the-dots to make a picture of a lower number.But despite these trivial annoyances, I grew up the luckiest person anyone I met had ever heard of.Until one day I wasn't.One minute I was enjoying a BBQ at the park, and the next I was being manhandled into the back of a police car.Somehow I then found myself on trial for the crime of stealing luck.And an hour after he banged his gavel, all 100 of my freckles were behind bars with me at Co-Farm Supermax Prison.But stealing luck isn't even a real thing!It's like alchemy.Or penis enlargement.Or finding the waters of eternal life.Just a pretty fairy tale.People want to believe it is possible.Some people are so desperate to believe that they fool themselves into listening to the stories.I guess that judge was one of those people.After all, he only had 16 freckles.He managed to become a judge in spite of his lack of luck, though.(Never forget you can make your own luck!)Obviously I will appeal the ruling, but it will take time.And of course the first argument I must make is that my freckles are not stolen.But how else could a person with 100 freckles be so unlucky as to be in this cell?I asked my cellmate this question, and he just laughed.I had been so caught up in my own disbelief I hadn't noticed his face.It had 100 freckles.After a day behind bars, I had learned that every person in CFS had 100 freckles.All the inmates, and all the staff.Hundreds of the world's luckiest people were all trapped in the unluckiest of places, in an impenetrable steel and concrete bunker, buried far underground.It had been converted from a huge government-owned nuclear fallout shelter.Escape was impossible.Most of us were locked away on false charges.What had happened to our luck?Each inmate was as confused as the next.We could not begin to fathom why our luck had suddenly failed.Luckily, we were not left wondering long.The virus spread quickly aboveground, and immediately wiped out anyone with fewer than 90 freckles.Those that remained alive out in the free world were forced to flee in terror from the shambling rotting victims of the plague who had succumbed to the disease.While they fought for their lives, those of us inside CFS were completely safeguarded from the virus and the after-effects.Eventually every person outside the prison had died from the virus or from unsuccessfully fighting off carriers of the disease.Then as luck would have it, the prison security system died, and we were all set free.Perhaps our false arrest wasn't so unlucky after all.
