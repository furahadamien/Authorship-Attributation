I don't know how but I find myself sitting in my old childhood bedroom.In the darkness.I was gone, and then poof, here I am, wondering what's next.I know I'm gone, I watched the instant replay of it before getting beamed up.Now I'm in my old bed.Waiting.That's when I hear a knock at the door.I don't realize it, but I'm not at all prepared for what's to follow.In walked myself.Wearing a black suit and tie.What's left of the hair combed over nicely.It was like looking in a mirror.Uncanny.Surreal.I felt a tinge of shame, though.Shame that even in death, I was disappointed in myself for not being in better shape.For not looking more youthful."You are about to go through your final judgments, old friend."Dark Mike says to me."I'm dead, right?What.. is this?"I manage to ask myself."Your final judgments..." Dark Mike says, cocking an eye up sarcastically in a way all too familiar."You will meet the four people that have been most impacted by your decisions."My mind flashes back.Victoria.Mom.Grandma.Sean.Melody.Images of people I wronged, people I cherished, people who hurt me.All people I loved."For your first judgment, it is the person you were the most cruel to.Spoiler alert, Mike.It's yourself."Dark Mike says as he extends a hand."I'll be judge number one today.""Psshh.." I say, shaking my head."Myself?"I reach for his hand to shake it.He grabs it with the other hand."Yes, Mike.Yourself.This isn't a joke, you must come to terms with this fact before you can move on.Look at me.How does it make you feel?""I feel sorry for Victoria, honestly."I couldn't help myself.Self-deprecation became a big part of my humor as I got older.I burst out a bit of laughter."Exactly."Dark Mike says.He picks up the remote and turns on the TV.The brightness temporarily blinds me as my eyes adjust to the screen.It's Victoria.My eyes well up as a lump appears in my throat.She's smiling, cracking up laughing.The screen quickly reveals me as the one who's got her rolling.It cuts to me tying my tie in the mirror.I remember this, it was her sister's wedding.I never noticed the way she was looking at me.The painful montage went on, and on until I was crying uncontrollably.I hated myself for so long, and I can see now it only served as a wedge between her and I.She loved me for who I was.I couldn't do myself the same justice.So many wasted moments.Anger rushed over me as I look up to tell Dark Mike to stop it.He was gone.I wasn't in my bed anymore.I was at Myers-Richman Office Supplies.My old company.Well, not *MY* old company, but the place I worked most of my life.Big shot account executive at 25 years old, 10 years down the line I'd still be an account executive.As I wander the dark halls of my old office, I reflect on how much I grew to hate this place.What *KEPT* me here.God, so much wasted time in this shit-hole."You weren't always nice to everyone inside this building," a familiar voice says from behind me.I turn."but there was one person you were very nice to.And that is the second person who is to pass judgment on you.And yes, as you've guessed--"  

It was me.At 30 years old, though.*Get out while you still can!!* I think to myself, ironically.  

"--the person you were the nicest to, was this guy.The Meyrs-Richman Office Supplies Account Executive Mike McAndrews."Dark Mike said, raising both his arms up in a shrug."I don't exactly follow..." I reply blankly.Dark Mike fired up a PowerPoint on the projector.As he flipped through still images of my expressions throughout my time here, he continued."Account Exec Mikey Drew needed a kick in his ass.He needed to taste the cruel truth that his talents were being wasted at this crappy company in a dying industry."Dark Mike explained, "He needed to hear that he was a lazy unmotivated coward.But you were nothing but nice to him."He had paused the PowerPoint on an image of myself crying on my way home from work.I barely remembered that.Tears began to stream down my face as my stomach sank inwards.Regret pressed against my torso, suffocating me.*How could I have let so much of my life go to waste?* I think."Alright, well presenting next is your third judgment.The person who was saved by your actions."Dark Mike said, as he turned and left the conference room.Before the door fully closed, he pushes it back open and walks back inside."Me again!"he says with a smile."You saved me, with all that kindness.You saved this guy, the person you became and eventually died as.Account Executive Mike McAndrews.""AND WHAT'S SO WRONG WITH THAT?!"I shout back at him.My face was red, rough.Dry tears left my eyes bloodshot and vision blurred.I stand up, and slam my hands on the table."TELL ME!"I shout."You already know the answer, Mike."Dark Mike says softly.The cabinets turned to bookshelves.The chairs to couches.The office turned into a bookstore and it was full of people.Dark.Everything is just, dark.I cant see their faces, I cant hear them, but I can sense their emotions.They stood in line, but all seemed to be looking at me.They all love me.They all look up to me.The line leads my eyes towards my final judgment.I can just feel it.I am truly curious, and make my way towards him.He sat there, at the head of the line.A table was set before him, he looked to be signing books.He looks vaguely familiar, but I can't figure out who I am looking at.He's older than me, much older.He looks cool.Relaxed.He turns up to look at me."I'm your final judgment, Mike.I am the person who died because of your choices."he stands up, and extends his hand."I am Mike McAndrews, pleasure to meet you."I step back.*Me?* I think."No, not you.Your heart doesn't make it as long as mine.All that stress you took on did a number on you, Mikey."Older Mike says."You know who I am, you are smart.I know that."Older Mike continues."You're the Ghost of Christmas Future."I respond, amazed.I observe myself.*Mid 60's.In great shape.Handsome even.Happy.*  

"You didn't appreciate the opportunity you had.You lived a full life, not to take away from that.You lived a life many would consider themselves lucky to have lived.Died too young?Maybe, depends on who you ask."Older Mike said."You knew you were depressed.You knew why.You knew what you had to do.You just, didn't."he continued."Do you remember Quentin Tarintino?Stephen Spielberg?Stephen King?"he asked, "Of course you do.You know another name that is synonymous with those in the year 2049?Mike McAndrews.You knew you had potential.All the feedback you ever received in your life were signs of this.My signs.You didn't listen, Mike.You've got one more shot, do something with it."and with that last word, he shoved me backwards and I woke up surrounded by paramedics.
