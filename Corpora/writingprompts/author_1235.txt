Well thats nice., I think to myself with a smile.It fades as I look around my dark, empty house.The house mates are both with family today.My eyes land on the half-empty bottle of vodka and favorite shot glass next to me.I sigh and pour myself another shot and chase it with a swig of soda.Grimacing from the awful taste of cheap booze I say out loud, Merry Christmas indeed., and queue up for yet another solo round of Overwatch.
