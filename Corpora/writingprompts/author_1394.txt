My Dearest Friend,

This last dance was splendid!All this sounds and lights and flames, this is by far our greatest moment so far!I have to say I'm proud of myself on this one, I brought the big guns if you know what I mean.I hope to see you again soon after your well-deserved winter rest.Yours truly,

Your waltz partner

My Dearest Friend,

It has been a while since I caught I glimpse of you.I'm worrying I went a bit too strong on you last time...But I know you're still out there since I am still here, so it is just a matter of time before we're reunited once again!You will be pleased to learn that our favorite toys have survived.Scattered and afraid yes, but Humanity lives on!It will takes time before they can be of any use to either of us, but I'll keep an eye on them in your absence.Yours truly,

Your longing playmate

My Dearest Friend,

Your absence is weighting on my heart, yet I know you would berate me or make fun of me if you were here.How far away have I fell from my fearsome days!Yet I can't let our favorite toys fell and rot without you by my side.You see, as your creations emerged from the centennial winter, so did a plague even I couldn't design: an unending wave of shambling corpse neither dead nor alive.How those little men who are already struggling against the Nature you designed would have any change against them?So I confess that -from time to time when the situation seems desperate- I took the habit to cut the string of those undead marionettes.I know you wouldn't approve, but they're barely holding together anyway.In a way, I'm just taking back what's mine with a quick snip.Preserving our favorite toys is worth bending the rule a little.Yours truly,

Your apprentice puppeteer

My Dearest Friend,

I am so sorry!I hope you'll forgive me when we are finally reunited.They think I'm you!As time passed my little... twists to our usual purview became more and more frequent and humans assumed it was your doing.They even began to build temples to worship the Unsewer.I know I should stop, but the waves of undead only become stronger with time and even if they're rediscovering their past tools, Humanity has still no chance to defeat them.Should I let events follow their course and reap them once and for all?No!I can't bring myself to do that.I have to protect your creations in your absence, and our favorite toys above all else.It's the only way I can hope to see you ever again.I miss you every day a bit more.Come back to me soon.Please.Yours truly,

Your devoted impostor

My Dearest Friend,

I finally saw you again after all this time.You were hiding in the depths of our last dance scar that humans has renamed Death's Maw.A small group of strong warriors ventured in the bowels of this corrupted place to find the source of the undead plague.I followed them and I saw you.I barely recognized you.You were frantically stitching back together the remnants of the old world to assemble more and more of those abominations that have been endlessly scourging the Earth for so long.Is that all you're able to now?I miss your beautiful work of old.I miss your colors and shapes and smells.I miss reaping them and seeing them whiter in their own unique way.Seeing you revelling in my rotten leftovers in a vain attempt to recreate the past broke my heart.I wish I could help you.I wish I could pull you out of this forsaken hole and show you how the world was reborn... but if I approach you we will just dance once again, don't we?My Dearest Friend, I'll be waiting your return.Since Humanity gave you my name, I will don yours.Yours truly, for now, and ever,

Life
