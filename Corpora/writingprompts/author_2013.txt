It was a normal Autumn day: overcast sky, a chill in the air and leaves of various colors strewn about on the ground.The weather was fitting as a few dozen people gathered in the local graveyard to pay their respects and say their final goodbye.The casket was lowered into the ground as the family of the deceased no longer could hold in what wanted so desperately to get out and cried in the arms of the other gathered.It was a sight the man had seen many times over; he frequented these types of places as they were a gathering place for souls not ready to move on.As many times as he had seen families cry from the deepest parts of their hearts, it was a sight never truly was used to seeing.He took some comfort in this, figuring it would be best for what he did to never become cold to the feelings of others.Within the crowd that stood by the grave, there was one that he had felt, one that drew him here.A young woman stood behind the mother and father as they knelt on the ground, trying to stroke their hair and comfort them but failing as her hand passed through them.The man approached the woman, "Excuse me?"The woman was startled, she flinched as she looked in the direction of the soft voice that called to her, "Wha..."  She looked at the man who called out to her, tears streaming down her face."They can't.....they can't..."

"I know, I'm so sorry."The woman kept trying, "I need to tell them its okay...I need to tell them I'm...I need..." Her voice wavered as she tried harder and harder to get the attention of her parents.She turned to others in the crowd, hoping one would be able to feel her, to hear her.Nothing worked.The man tried to think of something to say.He usually knew what to say to help the newly deceased, but there were certain times where he felt there was nothing he could say to ease the pain.The deep sting of realization was something the could only be soothed with time, for there was no changing what had happened.The woman's panic soon calmed as she returned to her parents, collapsing onto the ground in front of them to look into their eyes.She reached her hand out to her mothers face to wipe a tear, resting it as best she could on her cheek.Her mother raised her hand to where her daughters hand was, oblivious to the contact her daughter so desperately desired.The man walked toward them, stopping next to her.He dropped down to a knee, "She was precious to you?"The woman looked up to him, "More than anything...I want to go back..." Her gaze drifted back to her parents, "I want to go back to them..."

"I know.I know it's hard.It will continue to be hard but in time, " he rested his hand  on her shoulder, "it won't hurt anymore.""I don't know what to do.I don't want to leave them, I don't want to go.I don't want to be alone.""You will never be alone."The woman looked up to the man, he stood and reached out his hand to her, "I promise you that you  will never be alone again."She stared at him, unsure.He smiled as the sun broke from behind the clouds for but a moment.Her hand still shaking, she reached up to grasp his as he helped her up from the ground.There was a feeling of comfort that welled within her from this man's smile.She was still very uneasy, but her hands stopped shaking as she wiped the tears from her face."What do I do?I don't know what to do or where to go or..." her voice trailed off."Don't worry, I know a place you can go.""Where?"The man pointed to the horizon, "A place far off.A warm and loving place that lies under an eternal sun, full of many different folk, some whom I assume would love to see you again."The woman looked over to the headstones that sat beside her, familiar faces and names etched into them.She took a deep breath as she nervously rubbed her hands together, "Will you show me how to get there?"The man smiled again, "Of course.I'll bring you there myself."The woman looked back to the crowd and then to her parents.She approached them once more and stooped down to kiss them each on the head one last time.Her mother spoke, "I love you...I love you so much my dear."A knot formed in the man's throat.He tried to remember the last time he had heard those words spoken to him.It had been countless years...he never, however, second guessed the help he offered to those like this woman.The woman stood straight and looked at the man, "...Okay..."She walked up to him as the both turned to begin the journey.He felt her grab his hand and hold tight, feeling a slight tremble in her grasp.His grip remained firm, comforting both him and the woman.The woman spoke, her voice still shaky, "Thank you so much..."  The man glanced over to her, "It is my pleasure."
