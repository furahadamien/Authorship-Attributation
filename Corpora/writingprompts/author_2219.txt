The quartet are headed for class.This is typically one of the least typical times for things to go aray.Probability, of course, is a cheating bastard whom they have come to know well.Qua sighs, and pulls out the thaumameter."OK, so what do these look like?I'm really hoping it's not time magic."Oson pulls out a spell book, and opens it to the time-travel section.They had left a printout of what the thaumameter picked up when they last tried it.She sighs."It's time magic."Tami sighs."How big of a paradox are we looking at here?Do we have to start evacuating people?'Cause, well, the last one we made..."

Jav's looks at the two fighters."I don't...I don't think they're violating causality.Our little paradox was a pretty harsh violation thereof thencewhen and whattheheck.Hence the explosion."Tami stares at Jav."Wait, not violating causality?"One of the two fighters throws a punch.The other dodges.A lone flower slowly falls to the ground as a background shopkeeper slowly gasps in alarm.Jav nods."Action, reaction.Nothing particularly out of place, timewise.No paradoxes."Qua sighs."So, do we just let them duke it out?The other path to campus isn't much longer."Oson shuffles her feet."I'm pretty conflicted about letting people fight on one of the main trunk lines for the city..."

Qua responds, "Well, what *can* we do?They're moving too much to build a dispel glyph around them, not without taking out a few blocks.And then we'd all be late for class."Oson adds, "And liable.Magic like that is pretty strictly regulated."Tami adds, "And it'd piss off the unions, too.Time flow is pretty strictly mentioned in a lot of contracts."Qua looks at her."How would you know?Your parent's pay most of your tuition."Tami shrugs."My folks run a business with a strong union, and get along with them pretty well.I read the literature."Oson interjects, "That still does't solve our problem here."Jav nods."And that depends on their problem, there."Qua asks, "Was it a misdemeanor to set off stink bombs in public?"Jav pulls a few from his bag."Only if you're caught.And the way time is flowing, I think we might have a few moments to get away on one of the streets not afflicted."
