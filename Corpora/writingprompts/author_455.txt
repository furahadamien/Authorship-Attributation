Carl watched as the being devoured the man that had been clipping his nails next to him on his flight.Instinctively, he wiped the specks of blood from his jacket.Pointless, he thought, and closed his eyes.At least it would be quick and painless.Opening his eyes after what felt like an eternity, he gasped.The tentacles had retracted, and the husk that was left resembled a giant brain.>TESTING TESTING

Huh?Where had that come from?>DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?Carl nodded and gulped at the same time.>ARE YOU CARL

Nodding again, he squinted in confusion.>WELCOME HOME EXALTED ONE

Home?Home was a cube the size of a refrigerator on Zormax 4.Here?He didn't really know where he was.He had accepted one of those "you've won a free cruise to the Wastes" mindchip calls, out of sheer desperation for a bit of a vacation.>IS IT REALLY THE SIZE OF A REFRIGERATOR

Carl nodded, his head seemingly stuck in a loop."Uh... yes?It's... quite nice though.">WHERE DO YOU WORK?AN ENERGY STATION?HA.HA.HA.Normally, Carl would make a quip back.He dealt with enough shit from intergalactic truckers to take criticism for what he did, but this time was different.He wasn't sure whether or not he would be turned into a meat slushie like Gustav over there had.>MEAT SLUSHIE?DO THEY SELL THOSE ON ZORMAX 4?Shaking his head, Carl sighed."Who are you?How do you know my name?">YOUR GREAT GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER, WITH A FEW HUNDRED MORE GREATS, PURCHASED THIS STAR EONS AGO.WE  MET HIM THEN, WHEN WE WERE LITTLE MORE THAN THE SIZE OF ER, WHAT YOU CALL FLEAS.OUR TRANSPORT SHIP HAD CRASHED AND AFTER THE ORDEAL WAS DONE, WE ASSUME HE DECIDED TO BUY THE STAR AS A REMINDER

"Er, my grand...father?">YES.HE HAD TO PROTECT US FROM OVERZEALOUS MOVIE PRODUCERS.THEY THOUGHT WE WOULD BE THE NEXT E.T.BUT WE KNEW OUR IMAGE RIGHTS WOULD BE EXPLOITED.THANKFULLY YOUR GREAT GRANDFATHER SNUCK US INTO A STARSHIP WHICH WE COMMANDEERED HOME

"Are you serious?What does this have to do with me?">WELL TECHNICALLY THE DEED IS STILL VALID.IT TOOK US A FEW MILLENIA TO FIND THE DESCENDANT WHO LEGALLY OWNED THIS PLACE.JANICE FROM THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT WAS MEANT TO DO IT A FEW THOUSAND YEARS AGO BUT SHE WENT ON MAT LEAVE.SO WHEN WE FOUND OUT YOU WERE TAKING THAT CRUISE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, WE FIGURED WE'D REACH OUT AND INTRODUCE OURSELVES

"And you want me to..."

>WELL, ITS UP TO YOU.YOU'RE SORT OF THE BOSS AROUND HERE NOW.WE'VE GOT A NICE LITTLE SYSTEM GOING HERE.A FEW HUNDRED PLANETS CONQUERED, SOME BLOOD FARMS DOWN THE ROAD.LIFE'S GOOD 

Carl looked at the stain formerly known as Gustav, and grimaced."What about..."

>HIM?OH HE WAS GOING TO KILL YOU OR EXTORT MONEY TO GET YOU HOME.YOU KNOW THOSE CRUISES ARE SCAMS RIGHT?ANYWAY, LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND
