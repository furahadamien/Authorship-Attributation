As I hear the shots fire my heart drops...I can feel my face turning red as I start to sweat.He turns to me snd says "you're safe now".I manage to force a fake smile on my face for a few seconds as silence comes over us."My name is Mark by the way!"He states happily as he holds out his hand."Aaron" I said as I started to walk away and calm myself."You know, you should be a little bit more grateful Aaron.It took me months to track down that little bastard I just put a bullet in.Who knows what could have happened to you if I was even a few minutes late!"Mark said confidently as I began to to think to myself, how long did he know about my experiment?More importantly how did he manage to track it?"I have no Idea what you are talking about" I told him.Mark smirks as he walks over to his car and tells me to get in.As we get into his car and shut the doors he starts to explain."So I'm sure you heard identity theft?Opening up new accounts, credit cards the whole nine."I nod and sit quietly while Mark continued to explain."So that thing in your wallet that I managed to shoot was a tiny creation that copies all your cards in your wallet and sends them to a database somewhere within a 5 mile radius.So I'm guessing whoever did this was nearby.""My house is that one on the corner."I told him as we rode down the street."Come in for a drink, it's the least I could do for you after your help tonight."I managed to say happily.As he obliged we walked into my house.He stood in the living room examining the wall I had as a tribute to my great grandfather a soldier in Japan, on the wall stood three swords of the samurai and the armor they wore."Wow are those all real swords?"He had asked."Yes, are you familiar with the samurai Mark?"I said as i grabbed the tanto from the wall and unsheathed it."Yes.. the great swordsman masters of the imperial times."He replied."They were more then that, they were head hunters Mark.. you see when someone wanted you dead in imperial times the proof they would request is a head.So often times to disguise themselves the wanted men would kill other civilians and parade around as them."Mark stood there for a moment,
"So it's kind of like the guy who is stealing  thGAAAKAKKKK" as the tanto impaled him through the gut Blood rushed out of his mouth and he slowly keeled over."Kind of like me Mark who is now you."
