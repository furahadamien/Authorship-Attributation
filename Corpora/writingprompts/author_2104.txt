The voice... and the face that goes with it

I start to say something, "a-"

She cuts me off

She's saying things, I don't really know what, it's just noise, I'm trying to remember the worst thoughts I've had over the years.Then the thought slips, "maybe she knows too much, should I kill her?"She takes a step back, she knows that I thought it

"he's not serious, is he?"She takes another step back

I don't know if I'm serious, she knows that I dont know if I'm serious, she knows I might be, I dont

I have no plan, she knows I have no plan but it doesnt seem like she has much of a plan either

She takes another step back, looking into my expressionless face, she knows I'm not going to chase her, she runs

She has more than enough thoughts running through our minds for one person and I could swear I have twice as many, it's so loud... there's no break in the storm, just endless,thundering trains of thought with little to no direction compounding on top of one another, I want her to stop thinking but I can't stop on my end, every passing second I remember a thought, I hear her remember a thought, we're rationalizing, we're lying, we know we're lying.I could handle insanity, but this is too much, simply laying on my bed is exhausting, I need a drink or 12, I need silence

I win I lose, I lose I win, what is there to win?Time to get acquainted with an empty bottle
