Bayonet to the arm.Hes losing it.I cant do much, I think we need to amputate.Hopefully my own knife is clean enough.Put something for him to bite on, no booze around though.Cut deep, cut quickly.My shirt will have to stop the bleeding.God be with him.Theyre still shooting at us, dont they know its rude practice?The mound is enough protection, but this man might die anyway.I think the bleeding is slower, hes not quite unconscious yet.I think he might be okay.But the CO is pulling me awaywhys he beating me?Whats going on?Whys his arm off?Did I do this?Where did the cannons go?Tanks
