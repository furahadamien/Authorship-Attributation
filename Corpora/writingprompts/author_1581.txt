Ah, the break room fire.That was almost 30 years ago.Who would have thought that weird man could actually deliver, and that my drunken joke wish would turn out the way it had.Of course when the break room incident happened, it seemed weird, maybe my boss was just having a good day, or maybe he'd seen me panicking before I grabbed the fire extinguisher?It wasn't until 2 months later when they laid off my entire department for some BS "overseas initiative" that I started to wonder.A few weeks into my new life of sitting in an empty wing of cubicles with nothing to do; wondering why I was still coming in, how I had slipped through the cracks, and if my new out-sourced colleagues were enjoying their new jobs, I decided to test my theory out.I did every thing I could think of, many of which I am not proud of,  I almost had to get a new identity to get hired somewhere else after the shit I pulled.But it was worth it to confirm my suspicion.It was worth it to prove that somehow a crazy guy in an alleyway and two drunk words had made me un-firable!But, that was the beginning.When i realised what I could do with this gift, that's when my work really began.At first, I started by failing my way up, then, when I got high up enough, I found I took a sick pleasure in firing others.And now, after 30 years of hard work, it's finally happened, I've finally reached my goal.As of January 20th, 2017, I Donald J Trump have become President of the United States!It's gonna be great, you'll love it.
