Chapter 1

"Some are calling it the prank of the century, others believe it to be a supernatural occurrence, and still others call out 'conspiracy'.What is the truth behind the sudden alteration of mugs all over the world?Do they really reflect the rankings of dads?We'll be checking in with spiritualist Dave Connor and skeptic Alfred Hanny as they discuss the matter at 5-"

"...he throws, and...touchdown!"Mark hangs his head after the prison guard changed the channel on the TV.Out of the corner of his eye, Mark saw Davidson, a man convicted for killing his wife, hit the payphone against the wall, and started yelling, "Don't fuck with me Vincent!There not even 60 million dads in the world, how I be number 60 million and some bullshit?You think I'm some fuckin' shit dad?It's not my fuckin' fault I'm here, can't take care of Marissa..."

A guard responded to the commotion and after several hand gestures signalling Davidson to get off the phone, the guard pressed down the hook.Davidson immediately punched the guard in the face.Several guards from around the area ran towards him, and tackled Davidson to the ground.A man laughed as he sat down next to Mark, "Wow, man.Hey, I bet you have a bigger number than him, ya know?"The man taunted Mark, "What's it been for you, 30 years?For killing your little girl.And your wife just magically got dead too, but they don't charge you for that."Mark silently stands up, and walks away."Come on baby, don't act like that!Let's say you suck my dick and make up for how rude you're being right now to yo shugga daddy," the man said while following close behind, grabbing his own crotch.He spit at Mark, and then laughed.Another man, burly with a thick, curly black beard, stared down Mark as he passed by.He jumped at Mark to try to scare him, but Mark was unfazed.When he didn't get a reaction, he grabbed Mark by the crotch and squeezed.The man smiled, his mouth full of silver caps and missing teeth.Mark flinched, but refused to retaliate.The burly man leaned in and said, "You'll fuck up before you get out of here tomorrow, and when you do, you're mine."A guard rushed over and pushed the man off of Mark.He never shifted his gaze from Mark's eyes.He lifted his hands into the air while the guard pushed his forearm into his massive chest to get him back.Mark returned to his cell and laid down.The setting sun shined through the inch-wide slit they call a window in this place.Mark closed his eyes early today.Chapter 2

The next day, Mark was waiting at the gate leading to the outside with the clothes on which he hadn't seen for 30 years.It was back then he was standing on the opposite side of the gate looking in.The sound of the gate opening startled Mark, who was barely standing after his restless night.Five steps forward and he was free.Four, three... two... one more.He took his final step from the prison grounds, but the look on his face was not the look of a free man.A taxi cab honked to get Mark's attention.He looked up, squinting under the summer sun.He stepped in."Where to, Freeman," the driver asked.Mark handed him an address on a piece of paper, and fell back into his seat, gazing out the window.Then his eyes wandered to the front of the taxi where he could see a picture of a small dark-skinned girl posted on the dashboard, and then Mark looked at the cup holder to see a mug that read "#38,384 dad".45 minutes later, Mark handed a credit card to the cab driver to pay his fare, signed his receipt and got out of the car."Enjoy your freedom Mark!"There Mark stood, in front of a storage unit which held all of his belongings from 30 years ago, the only things he had left in the world.He pulled up the large metal door, which squeaked, and stuck.Cobwebs blanketed the numerous boxes and other belongings.Mark brushed away the webs with his hand to make a path.He knelt down and opened a box with old electronics.He tossed the box to the side, and opened the next box.He found his old gun.It still had a round in it.Mark set the gun down on a worn and dusty coffee table nearby, and continued rummaging.He found a picture frame.He dusted it off to show his wife and daughter laughing and smiling together.Mark stared at it.His movements became slower and more forced as he set the picture down and picked up a mug from the bottom of the box.He turned the mug around to see the engraving.It still read "#1 Dad".A tear strolled from his cheek, and mixed with the dust on the mug.The tear stopped abruptly, cradled by the engraving of the number.His head fell, and he rested his hand on the edge of the table beside him.
