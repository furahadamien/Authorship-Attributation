Koanos
It was a day like any other

Deflect the young,

Accept the one

But before my eyes,

A double of a 12, 1212

And then I knew: 

I always thought children would joke

That it was just the writers

Making fluff and fun merry for views

And before my eyes, 

A pair of kids, stacked like dishes

Wobbling about

And a guffaw let out.
