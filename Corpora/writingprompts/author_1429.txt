Looking down upon the disc, I start to wonder... where Albert is with my coffee.I had asked for it an hour ago not that time has much hold over my realm, I keep up the pretence for him..He... helps... after all.I have contacted War; his wife did not want to believe what was happening .. neither did I.Life was just burning out on the disc.War had attempted to incite the people to fight for their lives.After he failed.War, spoke with Pestilence, he swore that it was not his fault.Famine, burst though my door."I have tried, The elephants will not eat though.Not when At'une is dying"

SQUEEK  said the Death of Rats.I KNOW, HE MIGHT HELP.WHERE DID THEY GO WRONG THOUGH?SQUEEEK The death of rats replies.SHE WILL NOT HELP.HER HUSBAND IS DYING, TIME IS ABOUT TO DIE.Pulling a large life timer out of my robes, I feel a shiver run down my spine, Will this be my end as well?
