He boomed in an echoing deep voice that rumbled the earth beneath me."Now that you are here for eternity mortal.I wish to give you the chance to torture those who were sent down here and will be sent down here for eternity.I know a human like you would nev-"

"I'll do it.""You...what?""I will do it.""Now mortal, I know a human like you is sentimental, full of emotions, and would never hurt your fellow man in the way we need.Are you sure you are up for the tas-"

"Yep.""You seem... awfully glad to do this job.Why?""I worked retail.""That does not sound that ba-"

"For fifteen and a half years.I have dealt with the densest, rudest, and most irritating humanity has to offer.I have what it takes to be down here and do the job.""I do not have experience in what you are referring to as retail.Could you explain to me please?"I sit here with Lucifer telling him about my experience working in retail.I tell him about Jason, he was a good guy and the only thing that made retail somewhat bearable during the first few years.He would show me memes and had lunch with me sometimes.I liked Jason.Then I tell him about Douglas.Douglas was the boss that fired Jason and made everything a living hell.He was never on my side and often bickered on the customer's side even if they were incredibly wrong and he knew it.He bothered me during lunch break telling me he did not hire me to sit around for 36 minutes when I have a 35 minute lunch break.I tell him about that lady with the kid.The kid was running through the store and knocked things on the ground which gave Douglas an excuse to yell at me.I tell him about the lady who could not find the jeans even though I showed it to her around five times.And how she would scold me when I said "Do you really need me to show you again?"After showing her the fifth time.She then stormed out after calling me, and I quote "A rude little fucker who works retail and will never be anything."Then I tell him about that fat fuck, who trampled me carrying the tv on sale for 70% off.He asked where the tvs were and smelled like he had not put on deodorant for at least a week or two.He tried talking to me and asked me to show him where the televisions were gassing me further.He then waddled on my body pressing it into the ground.He sent me here and he was rude beforehand.I have dealt with those I am going to torture.I won't feel bad.
