Obversa
*25 December 1847*

-------

*To whomever may find this letter of note, do not come searching for me.Dare not to attempt to find me.It is only through my own sacrifice that I have spared the rest of my crew; or, perhaps, more so in giving them a chance to find assistance.However, given the savage nature of my captors, I cannot say I retain much faith in their survival.*

*I realize now that our expedition was not only folly, but doomed from the start.Not even all of my previous excursions could have hoped to prepare me for what we ultimately discovered.*

*It began with a grand vision to chart, and finally complete, the Northwest Passage, as led by Sir John Barrow, the Second Secretary of the Admiralty.Sir Barrow directed the Royal Navy to complete the Northwest Passage over the top of Canada, and to navigate toward the North Pole.To this end, I had previously served as the second-in-command of an expedition towards the North Pole, in the ships 'Dorothea' and 'Trent' in 1818.In later years, I served as the leader of overland expeditions to, and along, the Arctic coast of Canada during the years of 1819 to 1822, and 1825 to 1827.Yet, despite my long years of sweat and toil, the final piece of the Passage remained ever elusive.*

*By the time I was approached by the Admiralty to lead this expedition, I had already aged to a ripe fifty-nine years old.My once-slim figure had long since become round and full, and I sported a beard, and hair, beginning to turn as white as the snow in the North.Sir Barrow, already a respectable eighty-two years old, sought out a Captain for what he presumed to be his 'one, final chance at glory'.He had been quite stingy in his choices, and thusly, when he approached me, I deliberated long and well before assenting to the Captaincy.I must confess that, perhaps, in my foolishness, the idea of just one more Arctic expedition, and the allure of capping my career with, at long last, that Holy Grail of maritime exploration, was too tempting to resist.*

*To this end, I was assigned to the 'HMS Erebus', and given expedition command on 7 February 1845, with Sir Barrow delivering his official instructions on 5 May 1845.Appointed alongside me to helm this excursion was my erstwhile associate, Francis Crozier, who was given Captaincy of the 'HMS Terror'.*

*Much to our pleasure, the Admiralty spared no expense.'HMS Erebus' and 'HMS Terror' were both sturdily built, and were outfitted with steam engines, procured from former locomotives from the London & Croydon Railway.They enabled the ships to make 7.4 km/h on their own power, which would allow us to make excellent time.Both ships' bows were reinforced with heavy beams and plates of iron; an internal steam heating device for the comfort of the crew; screw propellers and iron rudders, which could be withdrawn into iron wells to protect from damage; ships' libraries of more than one thousand books; and three years' worth of conventionally preserved or tinned preserved food supplies.*

*Our expedition set sail from Greenhithe, England, on the morning of 19 May 1845, with a crew of 24 officers and 110 men.We moored in Stromness Harbour in the Orkney Islands in northern Scotland, and from there on, we sailed to Greenland, accompanied by 'HMS Rattler' and a transport ship, 'Barretto Junior'.At the Whalefish Islands in Disko Bay, on the west coast of Greenland, we moored again; refilled out meat supplies; and delivered the lads' letters home.From there on out, up until we became trapped in ice off of the coast of King William Island in September of 1846, everything appeared to be perfectly in order.*

*Of all of the crew, however, most of whom are Englishmen from the North, as well as a few Irishmen and Scotsmen, only I, Crozier, and Lietuenant Graham Gore, along with the assistant surgeon and two icemasters, proved veterans of previous Arctic expeditions.In particular, one of the crew, one Mr. William Gibson, finds fault with me due to this; he served, up until recently, as a steward on the 'HMS Terror'.*

*It is Gibson, I suspect, who is the cause of the discovery of our wayward expedition by those now responsible for my capture and imprisonment.Ernest Giles, an Australian explorer of some repute, once remarked to me: "I remarked to Gibson as we rode along that this was the anniversary of Burke's and Wills's return to their depot at Coopers' Creek and then recited to him, as he did not appear to know anything whatever about it, the hardships they endured, their desperate struggles for existence and death there; and casually remarked that Mr Wills had a brother, who also lost his life in the field of discovery, as he went out with Sir John Franklin in 1845.Gibson then remarked, 'Oh, I had a brother who died with Franklin at the North Pole, and my father had a great deal of trouble getting his pay from Government'."*

*If was not Gibson who proved responsible, then, perhaps the crew turned on me; I do recall noting their discontent at my banning of swearing and drunkenness, long before things started to go awry.Before our expedition's final departure, I had no choice but to discharge five of the men for these reasons, for whence they were sent home on 'Rattler' and 'Barretto Junior', reducing the ships' final crew size to 129.*

*All things considered, it was not long after becoming trapped in the ice that our expedition began to run afoul of luck.At first, we saw no reason to panic; we were well-stocked with canned food, and could easily spend months, if not years, waiting for the ice to melt, and free the ships.Scurvy, already not uncommon among the crew, became more prevalent; as our company ate our way through the rations, many of the sailors complained of pain in the abdomen and joints; constipation, nausea, and sickness; and fatigue.Quite a few seemed to lose interest altogether in eating; experienced difficulty, or inability, to sleep; seemed to grow forgetful; and often times, seemed decidedly more exciteable and irritable.*

*Then came the spread of what the assistant surgeon informed me is called 'phthisis' and 'lung fever'.It began with the deaths of shipmen John Torrington, John Hartnell, and William Braine, who were given a Christian burial on Beechey Island; the surgeon reported that Torrington had suffered from worsening lung problems before his unfortunate demise.*

*After both 'Erebus' and 'Terror' became trapped in the ice, we than began to notice that someone, or something, was hunting us.At first, being in uncharted territory, we assumed it was the brown-skinned Natives, with whom I myself had met, and had dealings with, on previous Arctic expeditions.Yet, as more of the crew began to die, one by one, I noticed something decidedly odd about the hunters' behavior and dress.Unlike the brown furs and clothing of the Natives, these peope I judged to be much smaller in appearance, and dressed in white clothing to match their surroundings.*

*At first, my crew and officers claimed they did not believe my findings; even I took a fair amount of time to convince myself of their existence.As to why they were following, and watching, us, I had no inkling.Yet, little did I know, of course, as to their true intentions.*

*After that, my memory becomes scattered and foggy.I can recall bits and pieces, but alas, no more.Before I was even quite aware of what was happening, I awoke in an unfamiliar room, only to find myself surrounded by the creatures.However, I soon found that I could not move; my body refused to respond.Despite my mightiest, valiant attempts to free myself, I could only watch as the beings, most of whom possessed pointy ears, removed my officer's uniform...and replaced it with red, woolen suit, consisting of a jacket and pants, lined with white fur; a nightcap; and a black belt with a wide buckle.*

*I was approached by one of the taller of the elfin people, a man with dark hair, pale skin, and red-and-gold striped clothing.He wore a stange sort of black hat, and smiled thinly at me with a knowing expression.*

*"Nice work, guys," the male, seemingly their leader, had said."It looks like we got ourselves a new slave.This one should do nicely."*

*I asked him who he was, and what he meant.*

*"I'm Bernard.I'm the Head Elf here at the North Pole," he replied.He slipped a small card into the breast pocket of the suit, patting it down."And we have a new job for you.In order to please millions of children around the world, toys have to be delivered."He paused."And before you say anything, I'm not gonna do it.It's not my job.I'm just an elf."*

*"But I'm Captain John Frankin of 'HMS Erebus'," I had said, frowning at him."I need to get back to my men.They need my guidance, my leadership.We need to wait for the ice to melt.They could die."*

*"Oh, you don't need to worry about them anymore," Bernard had said with a smirk."After all, we've got a lot of work to do, and only a year in which to do it.The spirit of Christmas must be appeased.You wouldn't want to be responsible for killing the spirit of Christmas, now, would you?"*

*Still bewildered, I had shaken my head.I assumed that this previously unknown species of humanoid, or tribe, worshipped this so-called 'spirit of Christmas'.Given that they held me captive, it would be unwise to refuse.*

*"Excellent."His lips had pulled back in a wolfish grin."Nice to meet ya...Santa."*
