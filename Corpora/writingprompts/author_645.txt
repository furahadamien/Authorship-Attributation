First time trying this.... Be gentle

It turns out that it was the best thing that never happened to me...In 2019, the FDA approved shipment of an experimental drug that stopped all aging on humans.Evidently, the government was secretly developing and testing this drug for decades, and in a last-ditch effort to save his first term, the president signed an order that made taking the drug compulsory for everyone born after 1993.I was just a few years too old, and over the course of a day, I became a member of the not-so-fondly termed "Lost Generations".Or as we thought of ourselves: the discontented masses.Now, needless to say, everyone from ages 18-26 rushed to the voting booths in record numbers, and reelected the president in a landslide.In the following years, there arose two classes of people: "The Chosen", as the inoculated were calling themselves, and "The Forgotten", to rub in the fact that The Chosen would live forever.The Chosen got the best jobs, favorable loan rates, housing options, etc.And just like that, a modern-day Caste system was born.It wasn't until the mid-2050s that The Forgotten began to hear rumors of The Chosen going berserk and killing everyone around them.Naturally, the people reporting these stories were dismissed as drunks or conspiracy nuts.After a while, the rumors became impossible to ignore; after previously virile individuals started to appear deathly thin, their skin yellow and brittle, and their teeth rotting out of their mouths.On my mail route, it became commonplace to see dozens of Chosen collapsed next to their front doors, unable to get inside, begging for someone to end their suffering.Now in my 80s, The Forgotten have started joking about the plight of The Chosen.The prevailing theme is that these side effects are what the Government was counting on all along.I initially ignored these ludicrous tales; no way  could my beloved country have done this to her own citizens.As I think about these stories more and more, I'm beginning to remember the state of things in my 20s: Climate Change was an imminent threat, overpopulation was putting our food supply in jeopardy, and racial tensions were rising to alarming levels.Now, however...
