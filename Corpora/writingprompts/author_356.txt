"Very funny, Michelle," Barack called into their new home, the letter in his hand.It has always been their tradition to out-prank each other when they move to a new place.JFK, alive?Barack chuckled as he folded the letter and placed it in his pocket.Michelle has got to come out with better pranks.Barack closed the wooden door and walked into the hallway.Boxes of unopened stuff laid strewn across it.Eight years of presidency had bestowed him countless of possession."Michelle?"Barack called out again, suddenly noticing the silence in the house.Just a few moments ago, he still heard the voices of Sasha and Malia giggling from the living room, while their mother asked them about their dinner choices.Except for Barack's footsteps on the floor, the air hung still.Something did not feel right."Michelle?Sasha?Malia?"Barack shouted this time, his voice mixed with a tinge of worry.This was not a prank that the girls usually play on him.His hand clutched the letter in his pocket."I am afraid that your wife and daughters are no longer in the house," a voice behind him suddenly said.Barack yelled as he swerved around.Standing between him and the door he just closed, stood a figure whom he has only seen on books and television."Martin Luther King," Barack whispered, unable to believe what his eyes were seeing.He had seen his share of crazy things in his eight years of presidency, but coming face to face with dead figures was something he never expected.Martin chuckled at Barack's response."Yes, that is correct."He extended his hand to Barack."And it's an honour to finally meet you, Mr President."Barrak took Martin's hand and shook it.He straightened himself, assuming the straight posture he was well known for.Being in the presence of legends required the courtesy, though he still struggled to hide the surprise in his face."The pleasure is mine, Dr King.Forgive me, but I must ask-"

"Your family is safe with us, Barack.And yes, the letter in your pocket is indeed from President Kennedy," Martin interjected."If I may, can you just walk me through what's going on here?"Barack gestured with his hands.He was feeling confused, as well as slightly taken aback.Nothing prepared him for this.Martin sensed the unease that Barack felt.It was understandable.When Gandhi first appeared to him, he could not sleep for days.He placed a hand on Barack's shoulder.What he was about to say to Barack would be far worse than meeting dead people."Barack, listen here, I am here to tell you that in a few weeks time, you'll be assassinated."Barack flinched an eyebrow."What?"Surely he was dreaming.The stress of the past eight years must have finally got to him.The strength of Martin's hand on him, however, felt real.Martin gave Barack a sympathetic smile, just like how Gandhi had done so to him."Yes, I am afraid so.This is just how things are supposed to work.Before you start your real job.""Don't I get a say in this?"Barack questioned.He had been looking forward to some time off after his presidency.Another job was just out of the question.He could only lose so much hair.Martin however, shook his head."Barack, I am sorry, but it wouldn't be possible.My boss will not let it.""And who is your boss, if I may ask?"Martin Luther King smiled at the question, as if it was the question he had been waiting for Barack to ask since they first met."His name is Jesus."-------------
