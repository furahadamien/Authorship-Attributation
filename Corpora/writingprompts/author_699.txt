It lets me see both worlds.That's the worst part.I can see where they go.I can see the realization dawn on their faces as they are welcomed.I can see the gratitude.That's what keeps me going.But when It's sheathed, I can only see this world.I can only see the gore, the terror, the havoc We wreak.I can't kill fast enough.I can't kill enough of them.How could I ever convince them of what happens?I don't think I can give It to someone else.It seems to have chosen me.It drives me.I have to outrun the law of this reality for as long as I can, kill as many as I can.I have to hold out as long as I can, stomaching all the violence, Sending as many as I can, praying that this isn't all some horrific delusion and I really am a monster.Knowing, though, that I will be the last to go.Unless someone brings a gun to this knife fight...
