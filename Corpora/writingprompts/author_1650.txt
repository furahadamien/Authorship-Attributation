The demon's flames dwindled when I desperately screamed I was trying to make chicken soup.He gave a sigh of relief, and raised clenched fists.Clouds of tar-black smoke billowed out the crevasses of the floor and across the grotesque scars and wounds on his fiery skin, covering most of his body in dark, apron-shaped toxicity."Let's get to work, then!"the demon said, and scanned the kitchen."What are we working with?What ingredients did you buy?""I-I...chicken?"I said, trying to compose myself.However, it was no easy task, I could see my worst nightmares through the demon's hollow eyes.He came and stared at me, prodding my chest with a crooked forefinger, burning a hole on my shirt in the process."You.I like you.Every chef knows that a chicken soup is not a chicken soup without proper chicken.Tell me, where did you get the chicken, what breed of chicken is it?"I froze, the smell of smoldering cloth pervading my nostrils.His face.It shifted every time I blinked."The supermarket, and... and I don't know the br-breed.A farm one?"The demon swung his hands exaggeratedly across the air, and the red of his skin changed to a scalding, glimmering orange, much like molten metal.Then, he drew a deep breath and nodded."I will tell you something," the demon said through gritted teeth, attempting to control his fuming wrath."First I loved you, but now I hate you.You are a man of wit.You know the ingredients of a chicken soup, but you are not a man of knowledge.To make a perfect chicken soup, you need the perfect chicken."He eyed me, and crossed his four arms, as if waiting for me to answer.I frowned.What was I supposed to say?"Where can we get a perfect chicken?"His eyes, mouth and nose disappeared, leaving only an eerie grin of unnatural curvature, length and razor-sharp teeth on his face."I'm glad you asked that."He made a circular motion with his hand, as if opening a faucet.A square-shaper portal of ever-flowing fire appeared between us."You first," the demon said."We are going grocery shopping."------------------------
