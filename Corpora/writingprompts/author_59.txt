As the rocket rose, Bond struggled against his restraints, crrushed into his seat by the enormous force of the Falcon Heavy.With an incredible effort, the  chin of his helmet inched towards the laser tie pin Q had equipped him with for this very purpose.It connected, and an intense beam of light seared through the racesuit.Wincing in pain at the laser searing his flesh, he used his chin to run the beam over his restraints, freeing his arm.He reached for the dashboard..

A great jolt slammed Bonds head forward.Reeling, he registered the booster separation just long enough to avoid blacking out.His arm rose and punched the central screen with its cruel DONT PANIC message.What appeared was a very different pair of words.Aston Martin.The internal cameras saw the Tesla shimmer and warp as the repurposed cloaking system of the Aston Martin Vantage revealed the true nature of the vehicle.Wires shot out, taking over the core booster's control system and self destruct.The rocket spun round under Bonds control, crushing him against the side of the vehicle.As it began to change course, he set the destination as Musk's luxurious mansion/Galactic Command Centre.Bond punched the button to release the payload fairing, wondering how he would ever explain this to Q.The car  radio crackeled to life.Musk."Bond you FOOL!What are you doing.Do you think this will stop ME!MARS IS MINE!MIN...."

"You know the difference between your car and mine, Mr Musk?"WHA....He flipped the cover of the ejection seat/martini dispenser."MINE'S SELF DRIVING!"As a fireball grew in the distance, Bond sipped his martini, knowing that the only thing breaking the sky of this perfect day was a parachute bearing the symbol of Her Majesties Government.
