*"I wish I knew what I know now, when i was younger."- Rod Stewart*

Civilization is strange.Always tinkering with things.Hell, some jackass had to give himself small-pox just to cure small pox.This was long ago of course, but it stands to reason, people just can't leave well enough alone.So, when Harold found himself at his familiar drinking hole, this very thought almost made him fill his depends."So, did you boys see the news?"Jeremy asked.Jeremy was a bastard of a man.Once a brawny lumberjack of great height, who had shrunk a considerable deal over time, and was now of normal height.Harold always assumed this was because cause trees naturally weigh more than people."What!?"Leonard of Downey Street yelled.The old man had forgotten his hearing aide again."I SAID DID YOU SEE THE NEWS?"Jeremy yelled."Oh!I find the Jews to be a very nice people."Leonard said softly while taking a swig of his pint."No.Not the Jews...I mean, yes.They are kind, a little complainy from time to time, but they seem well intentioned.You see, when I was a lad, we had a Jewish fella what lived down the..."

"What about the news?"Harold asked.Sometimes it was important to keep these older chaps on point.They were pushing mid-nineties.A lifetime away from where Harold sat at 84."What news?"Jeremy asked."What!?"Leonard yelled."Jeremy was talking about the news Leonard, yah deaf bastard.Where is your hearing aide?"Harold asked.Leonard was essentially the anti-American Express ad for hearing aides.*Never leave home with it.*

"Mildred must have hid it from me.You know she can be sneaky like that."Leonard said, using a rather selective hearing method."You gentlemen need another drink?"A waitress had popped up seemingly out of nowhere.But, to be fair, anybody walking at a brisk pace was seeming to pop up out of nowhere for Harold these days."Jesus!What are you trying to do?Give me a heart-attack!?"Yelled Jeremy."Jeremy, if i wanted to, I could have given you a heart attack a long time ago honey."The young waitress said."Oh, you vile temptress."Jeremy said, "Alright, put the next round on me.""Why thank you Jeremy."Harold said.As the waitress walked off, Jeremy eyed her up and down, "Oh, if I were only 60 years younger.""Then you'd still be ten years too old for her you ancient bastard."Harold said, which spawned a laughing/coughing fit from Leonard."Ah, whatever.You young bucks don't know what it's like to be my age.""What!?"Leonard yelled."I'm only ten years younger than you."Harold said."Well, the difference between 84 and 94 is like the difference between young Philly and a dead horse.Hell, when I was your age, I was running marathons and could bench three hundred pounds.""Hah!I loved Family Matters."Leonard chimed in."Jeremy, I knew you when you were my age, and you were just as decrepit as you are now."Harold said."Well..." Jeremy took time to think of a comeback, which in terms of a heavily medicated 94 year old was much like watching molasses swallow a city."You should mind your elders.""That Urckle was hilarious!"Leonard said."Ah.You got me."Harold somewhat admitted defeat.It wasn't that he felt he should respect his elders.Hell, he *was* an elder, but it was a good way to drop the subject.Especially with Jeremy."Anyways.What was the news?""Oh right!The news!"Jeremy shouted."Your pints gentlemen."The waitress popped back in."Ye gods woman!You need to wear a damned bell!"Jeremy exclaimed."Right."The waitress put the drinks on the table and walked off."You know, if I was sixty years..." Jeremy began."...Yes.Yes."Harold interjected."Anyways, what did you see on the news?""Oh yes!The news.So, remember that drug that kept all those little bastards young?"Jeremy asked, as if there was any way to forget the anti-aging drug."Yes.I remember.""Well, it turns out it gives you stage 4 lymphoma!HAH!"Jeremy brought a fist down onto the table in exultation."Ye gods."

"Now boarding flight 304."The intercom called out."Oh shit, babydoll.It's happening!"I said to my fiance as a massive grin seemed to take over my face."Cancun!"I shouted into the airport terminal, as others tried their best to ignore me."Oh my God!"Alexis yelled, her eyes widening."Finally, a trip with just the two of us.Jeremy, I love you so damned much."She said as she leaned over and kissed me on the cheek.In truth, we had earned this trip.We'd been together for closing in on six years.Owned a house with one another, and had two pupperoos back home.Alexis supported me through school as I went for my Physician's Assistant degree, and once I finally graduated and found a job, I asked her to marry me.She was the love of my life, and she deserved this trip for putting up with my dumbass for so long, and also understanding that sometimes I sort of get warped away to help my ex... We'll get to that.As we grabbed our luggage and stood up, I began to hear a voice slowly fade into my consciousness."Fuck, not now."I said aloud.Alexis turned to me."What's wro..." She began to ask, before she realized what was happening.Alexis was used to this."Ahem," A beautiful yet familiar voice began to speak in my head, "This thing on?""God dammit, Aphrodite!What is it now?"I screamed within my own mind."Oh, I was just swinging through to tell you, you left the oven on."Aphrodite replied."Oh, really?"I said, trying to rethink leaving the house."Fuck no.What are you, stupid?It's Shelly again."*"Of course it is."* I responded."Look, she's in really bad trouble this time, and I hate to ask you, because it seems like you're a tad busy, but... you know.You made the deal, dipshit.""I was fifteen!"I snapped back."Well, some people build antimatter accelerators at that age.You?You swore yourself to a future addict.And *that* future addict, needs you right now.""Fuck me!""Well, I would, but it seems like you're engaged.Lovely fiance by the way."Aphrodite retorted."What?"*Poof*

     In an instant, I was standing on the second floor of an unfamiliar apartment complex, staring at an unfamiliar door.Down the hall, a man was hunched over vomiting into a bucket, which begged the question, which came first, the vomit bucket, or the man?"Look, I know it's normally mundane shit," Aphrodite spoke in my ear, "and as much as I love fucking with you, she's in real trouble this time, Jeremy."Aphro's voice became urgent, "You need to get in there.NOW!""Fine.Fuck it.Not like I can say no, anyways.I really just want this shit to be over."I said, as I reached for the doorknob."That's a good lad.Maybe, I'll find a nice man in Cancun to keep Alexis company while you're gone."Aphrodite responded."Fuck off.Let me do my job and take me back.""Ooo, someone's cranky."With this, the presence of Aphrodite left my mind.She was seriously, such a bitch.The door wasn't locked, so i opened it slowly.The first thing I noticed was the smell.It hit me like a wave.A pungent, sulfurous smell wafted into my face, which immediately made me lift the collar of my shirt over my nose.As the door opened more, I saw it was incredibly dingy and dark.No lights were on."Fuck, this isn't good."I said to myself, as I stepped into the room, an audible squish coming from the carpet.I made my way into what seemed to be the living room, which had the kitchen and dining room attached.The place was a mess.It was as if a hoarder lived there.Newspapers and Magazines all over.Worthless knickknacks strewn all over the apartment.A T.V was on in the corner, but only static poured out of the screen.The apartment was a place of nightmares.I walked slowly past the kitchen and living room, presuming one of the final two doors must have been the bedroom.Shelly had a knack for doing her drugs in the bedroom.Shelly actually loved the bedroom.Even when we dated, we would spend most of our time in bed.We were only fifteen at the time, so only once did it end up in sex, but every time we hung out, it was in a bedroom.Be it listening to music, doing homework, or just making out.She loved for it to be in a bedroom.I didn't mind of course.She was a pretty girl showing me affection, in her bedroom.It could have been worse.I chose the door on the left, and to my surprise, I guessed correctly.The door opened to the bedroom.As I opened the door, the first thing I saw was a figure in the dark, scurry into the corner, and crouch.Out of either fear or just panic, I slammed the door shut.*Fuck that shit.*

     "Shelly?Is that you?"I called out from beyond the closed door.*nothing*

     "Shelly?"I called out once more."Jeremy?"I heard her voice call my name faintly."I'm coming in, okay."I said as I began to open the door once more.This time when i opened the door, Shelly was laying on the bed, no longer in the corner.I must have scared her when I had come in earlier."Shelly, sweetheart.Is everything okay?"I asked, as I approached the bed, and sat down next to her."Why did you leave me?"Shelly asked."Oh."She caught me off guard with this one."Well, we were young and things happen.""No."Shelly said, her voice faint."Why did you leave me when you saved me from that car, or when you talked me off that ledge, or when you stopped that attacker from takin..." Her voice broke."Why do you always leave?Why don't you ever stay?"This took me aback.Shelly was an addict, but she wasn't always an addict.When we were both in our early teens, I had saved her from a man who had tried to kidnap her.That was the last time I had ever seen her clean.I showed up, managed to get her away from him, and then like that, I was back in my college dorm room.All I ever cared about was how it affected me."Well, sweetie.I don't have control..."

     "Bullshit.You have control.You left me, Jeremy.You.Left..." Her voice trailed off."Shelly?"I said."Shelly!?"A panic began to rise within me.I reached down and felt her darkened body.She wasn't breathing, and had no pulse.Quickly, I began chest compressions.30 and 2

     30 and 2

     But, nothing came up.I called 911 and kept pressing until an ambulance arrived.They pronounced her dead.She had overdosed well before I had gotten there.I didn't know.It was just so dark.I was scared.*I didn't know.*

     Then in a flash, I was in a beach chair, alone staring out into the gulf, as the sun set before me.I looked beside me and saw Alexis sleeping."Hey, so I just want to let you know, you suck."Aphrodite's voice popped back in my head."I did everything I could!I gave her CPR for 30 straight minutes!""Oh, you stupid fucking boy.She didn't need CPR.She needed you."Aphrodite began, "You were only around to save her when you needed you.You should have just been there when she wanted an ear to talk to.When she ran out of gas, or when she needed to decompress.You were there for the grand events, yes.But, you were never there for the events that lead up to them.So con-fucking-grats, Jeremy.You are finally rid of her.I hope you are just crying with glee right now, you piece of fucking shit.""I didn't know..." I said, lost within my own mind.The heartbreak and feelings pouring through me.I didn't know.I DIDN'T KNOW!"I know you didn't."Aphrodite said, and then she was gone.I sat in my beach chair, tears welling in my eyes as a blurred watery vision of a boat began to set sail, heading off to find fish in a better bay, leaving the old fishing ground behind for good.
