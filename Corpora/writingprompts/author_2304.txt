Tea time mister.Do you want some tea? a little girl asks me.Im confused yet relieved to be free from my prison cell.I last remember having a heart attack.How I came to be in a childs bedroom and being offered tea instead of hospital is a mystery.Child why am I here? I ask.I donno you just appeared after I wished my stepmom would just go away.She is crazy mean to me and demands I make a cuppa for her every day but always complains its no good.Maybe youre here to help me make her tea she says.I says Well I am an expert at making a very special tea, so thats why I am here.To help.What is your name child? The child grins and says Deloris.Whats yours? Graham Frederick Young at your service.Lets start brewing.
