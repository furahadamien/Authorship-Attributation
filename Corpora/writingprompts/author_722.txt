GODDAMMIT
How did it come to this..I've been doing so much for so long...
Fucking Keaney, Jared, Annie..I "killed" my friends and family for this.They never understood.Each and everyone I tried to explain it to just screamed and tried dot get away.Chasing down my loved ones... their screams.. God it's such a viscerally draining experience.It's almost making it easier as I go, the nerves being fried from the same adrenaline, the ears ringing, the deadpan stare I put up so they dont see the fear and pain in my face.I only hope they actually know what's going on when they get there.That I'm doing this for them, to help them, to save them.It's because I love them.Fuck I do it to each and every person I possibly can because I love them all I want them to be saved.It feels fitting that I'm the one to do it.I've always had those intrusicely violent and unsettling thoughts.I've always loved and identified with the tragic hero, misunderstood and standing his ground.Like a stoic Captain America in his Civil War.But my war was not a civil one.It first came in a dream, a picture of fire and an echo of screams.Grand explosions through the horizon and great beasts of fire razing the land.No dream journal or therapist could give me a good answer as to why it felt so real, and why it was so detailed.Some offered me money when  they realized the similarities between my dream and certain sequences of events, seeing the pattern and hoping to cash in on my "psychic" abilities.But the truth was the only part they cared about after long was the beginning.Large city, maybe New York but I'm not sure, headlines on newspapers and radios blaring this and that ab ok it sports and celebs, and a feeling of calm.The kind you really only get after a busy week on a Sunday morning off with an overcast sky, picking through an outdoor market.True serenity, but underneath the worst twinge of uneasiness I'd ever known.It grew and grew until the sky itself had turned a vibrant yet dark purple.It was only that color for a matter of seconds before lightning seemingly made of fire cracked through the sky into the ground.From the explosions and fire, dark and red figures emerged, lurching and lumbering in their new hunting ground.Killing and destroying they attack all in sight.As one comes for me my dying moment is always interrupted by the dagger.Wicked and shiny, seemingly made of black shiny bone, throwing off flashes of blue and purple from light bouncing off the razor sharp edges.The handle was wrapped in some thick wicked leather darkened by blood and evil.I instinctively reach out for it every time.And it always feels good.So good I cant let go, it shows me so many things.Beautiful scenes of nature and wondrous animals, a thriving human race free from disease and bountiful in resources.In an instant i know that it is possible.This pure hot joy and hope are enough.But the instructions are unclear and I scream against them every night."KIiiiIiiiIIIlll....Kill them.."
It whispers raspily."I can save them, you can save them, WE CAN SAVE THEM" It screams angrily into my mind.I'm petrified but the only thing I know is that its telling the truth.Its maddening, to save them I must kill them?Nothing makes sense in that, but this growing need to 'save' people wont let go.I cant sleep anymore and I cant even focus enough to read or watch TV.The only things in my head are "kill them" and "save them" going back and forth over and over until the overlap and turn into a singular and demonic noise I cant help but understand.The truth, where they will go, how it's better, why it needs to happen.It's not words but its knowledge.It's funny how ancient knowledge comes through like emotion.So murky and undefined yet as soon as you receive it the ideas flow through you like the first sparkings of true love.Undeniably clear what I must do, I snap.The first time is messy.Scary.I feel dirty as I get this poor girl overly drunk, and evil as I get closer and closer.This timeless and ancient rhythm of destiny thumping in my chest, I remove the wicked dagger from my belt.Before she can turn I grab her by the mouth and drag her drunken and weakly struggling body into the alley corner.After clumsily slashing and stabbing I was covered in blood and shaking.As I watched the life sill from her body and the sanity bolt from my mind screaming and running I recieved a vision.A birth into a new world.My victim walking in a paradise, understanding, thanking me and turning off into a new life.It's only a second but I believe it.I have to.3 years later and 477 so-called murders later my crimes are catching up.Somehow my DNA was never on scene and the blade has left no evidence of a true murder.The only things to be found by police are a dead body and plenty of paperwork.But this time, this time I made a mistake.Same gag, buy her a bunch of drinks then take her out to the "cab" I called.As I go to "move" the young lady into position for a "smooth transition" by the dumpsters she stops walking.My knife and arm are already raised and poised to deliver a blow to the base of the skull to incapacitate her.That's when I see it.The shadow, she sees the shadow, knife and all.I go to swing in panic and she whips around tries to dodge, taking the brunt of the blow in her shoulder and collarbone."FUCK I'm sorry just FUCK ST-" I exclaim as she tries to get past me.She knees me and bolts, screaming for help.Before I know it theres a group of men coming to her aid.The spot me and start yelling over about calling the police.One starts towards me.It's over isn't it.This is it.I knew it would end someday and I knew it would end bad.Violence, police, standoffs.Maybe even a hostage.In the end I die and go to the same place as them no matter how but I dont want to die.I know theres something else there and I know itll be okay but my self preservation wont let me feel okay with it.But life doesn't exactly wait.And death, well death tends to run at you with scythe in hand.The only difference is right now, I'm the one with the scythe.First thought in my head after my end all realization was fuck it.I sprint towards him at full speed knife hidden in my jacket.Hes caught off guard and the shortened distance he gave me only helped.Slash to the neck.On to the next.His buddies see him go down and run to aid only to find themselves being cut or stabbed one by one.Eventually the scene starts to take on a sort of Crimson feel and I start running the streets for victims.Eventually police catch up with me.My final moments on this planet would have been the news story of the century had the world lived beyond the following day.In a well lit strip mall parking lot surrounded by bodies the police find me.The first car pulls up to the parking lot entrance before the officer gets out and takes cover by his door aiming his weapon at me.He barks commands that I half heartedly follow, exhausted and slightly sickened by the violence of the night.I feel the nausea worsen as my mind catches up with the events of the night.Flashes of men, women, children, animals being slaughtered and slashed.Blood and screams echo in my mind.I drop to my knees and close my eyes.The paradise blooms in my dark eyelids."Oonneee moooorree...." the dagger whispers."Come to ussss...." the paradise beckons.Finally...
An officer makes his way through the littering of victims on the sidewalk to arrest me, firearm trained on em the whole time.I open my eyes and look into his briefly before he stops and tenses up.He knows what's about to happen.He says "Sir, please stay where you are, nobody else has to die tonight.Please"
Hes obviously shaken by what hes seeing..I cant let him live on with this trauma without knowing.He cant be broken by me for no reason even if his world ends soon.Even after all the years of apathetic murder for the greater good, I still feel a responsibility to people.To protect them.If I can just show him what's after this horror.I drop my head.He slowly continues his approach.As he  gets closer his foot slips on a bloody rag left by a victim.I pounce and stab him before he hits the ground.The impact of us falling together causes him to fire a round into my chest, and the shock of being stabbed causes him to fire 6 more.As we lie bleeding and dying together I tell him I'm sorry and I did it for him.Paradise awaits.Right?
