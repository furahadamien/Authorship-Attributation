"I'll have the buffalo burger--medium rare--please," Alan said, before looking over at his date and smiling.She met his eyes and nodded."and the same for her.Thank you."The waiter collected the menu and left the two alone.Decorations adorned the restaurant he'd chosen for this first date.Lots of pink hearts of all different sizes."So," she started, "how was work?"Alan smiled and leaned forward."Nothing too exciting, just kept working on that case I told you about.You?""Same.Minus that working on a case bit," she laughed.Her bright blue pool of eyes threatened to swallow him whole.Alan knew he wouldn't mind that one bit."Count yourself lucky, Julie.Sometimes I feel like I'm climbing a mountain of--"

**Poof**

A car roared by, speeding down a four lane highway.Alan screamed and stumbled backwards into a median."What the fuck!"he yelled.Ten years and he still hadn't gotten used to this.A familiar face appeared from behind a parked car--Allie's Camry.The emergency lights blinked on and off."Sorry," she said apologetically, giving him a short smile.The first thing Alan noticed was her short brown hair.She'd finally cut it.Her bronze eyes locked onto his, two windows into the past."Allie, I was on a date.She's gotta be's freaked out...I haven't told her about--about _this_ yet.Not like they stick around after I tell them," his voice dropped into a mumble.Allie bit her lip, "Oh," she replied, her eyes dropping."Sorry."Alan sighed."It isn't your fault.You're not the one who said something stupid."Once the shock drained from his mind he paused to inspect the situation."Flat tire?""Yep."With a quick shake of his head he moved to help her.The sooner Allie drove off, the sooner he could return to salvage whatever remained of his date.Alan exhaled to force the frustration away.Allie had already moved the jack underneath the car.No more than twenty minutes would be needed if the two worked together."No AAA, huh?"Allie rolled her eyes and moved to the back of the car.Alan squatted and started raising the car.After a moment Allie reappeared with a socket wrench in hand."Ever the comedian."Alan looked up and grinned.A minute later the car rose a few feet off the ground.Alan took the wrench from Allie and began loosening the lug nuts.The silence between the two broke whenever a car zoomed by.Finally Allie spoke, "What's she like?""Who?"he asked, distracted."Your date, you looby.""Ah.Julie's nice.She's smart and kind, works as a nurse.I like her."Despite Alan being unable to see her, she nodded and smiled."Good, I'm happy for you.I just hope I didn't mess anything up.""It's all right," he replied."Really."The two fell silent again as Alan focused on getting the wheel off.He'd taken off all the lug nuts, carefully handing them to Allie.Losing those damn nuts was the last thing he needed.Alan rose and bent backwards to crack his back."You okay?You're doing all the work.I feel bad.""I'm fine," he replied, walking over to the trunk.Allie had taken the replacement wheel out already."Here, help me with the wheel."Alan motioned for Allie to hold it so it wouldn't roll away.A horn blared as Allie walked over.Alan turned and his eyes widened.Mustering all of his strength Alan jumped toward Allie and pushed her away as a white Mustang slammed into the side of her Camry.The car crumpled from the force, falling off the jack.The Mustang bounced off and away before coming to a stop in the middle of the next two lanes."Oh fuck!"Allie screamed from the other side of the median."Oh fuck, _fuck_, shit, shit, shit!"Carefully she climbed back over the median."Alan, jeez, you really saved me there.You okay?"No response came."Alan?"Concern crept into her voice.Voices screeched from a distance.Everything felt numb.Allie couldn't hear herself repeat her question.Her eyes fell upon the point of impact, then followed along the rear toward the median.The car had been pushed forward a few feet, grinding along the concrete barrier.Where was Alan?"Help, someone help!"a frantic voice called."Someone help me!"Allie shook her woolheadedness away and almost ran forward.Traffic had stopped at this point and those once distant voices sounded much closer.She rounded her broken car, barely noticing the pain in her knee.Her savior lay splayed in front of the Mustang.Blood gushed from beneath Alan's hair and his limbs twisted unnaturally.Something stopped Allie from running to his side.A second later and he disappeared.Allie shuddered and dropped to her knees.
