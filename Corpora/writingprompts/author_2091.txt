*Well that was a bust...*

**C'mon.I know you really liked her.**

*I mean I did but...I guess she didn't feel the same.Seems like that's been happening a lot lately.*

**You'll find someone.I know your heart.You're too good to be single forever.**

*Yeah, okay.No offense but I don't know how much that's worth coming from you.*

**Thanks, dickhead.It's not like I don't know every single thing about you that there is to know.**

*I mean, of course you do.You're just a-*

**Hey!There's that bakery you love!I think you deserve a cookie.**

*No way.What if she didn't like me 'cos I'm too fat?*

**Don't be stupid.Go get one!For me.**

*Fine.But I'm working out when I get home.*

He held the door open for the woman behind him.She thanked him and made her way inside.**I'm excited for this cookie.**

*Me too.Which one should I get?*

"Oatmeal raisin, please."**Oatmeal raisin, please.**

He chuckled a bit.*Jinx!*

**It doesn't count if she said it.**

*Well she can't hear you.*

**Which is why it doesn't count.**

He ordered his cookie and sat down, reflecting on his date.He heard her thoughts too but after all this time, it was easy to tune them out.Millions of thoughts a minute ran through his head.Hers and his.He sensed nervous ones racing through their minds.*You okay there?*

**Finally.**
"Finally."*Hm?*

**Turn around.**
"Turn around."He turned around and came face to face with the woman who had ordered before him."Sorry?"Tears welled in her eyes.**I finally found you.**
"I finally found you."His confusion turned into realization.His eyes widened, "Do you...do you mean?"**March 4th, 1982.Blue.Mother's name Maria.First dog, Boston.Biggest fear, being alone.**
"March 4th, 1982.Blue.Mother's name Maria.First dog, Boston.Biggest fear, being alone."*Oh...my god.*

**Last thing you masturb...**
"Last thing you masturb..."

"Hey!!!!I...I get it."She laughed out loud and held her face  in her hands, as if she still could not believe he was right before her.*I can't believe you're real.*

They looked at each other until he gulped.*Well please...sit down.*
