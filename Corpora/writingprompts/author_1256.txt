I stared at the phone screen, wiping the sleep from my eyes.A smile crossing my lips as tears began to surface.The one thing that I always wanted to hear from my blood relatives, written to me on reddit, by a kind anonymous stranger.Reaching up, I wipe my eyes before the tears begin to fall.Slowly, I rise to my feet and head to the kitchen to join my small family, my tribe in the kitchen for breakfast as I am greeted with joyful laughter."You too, my fellow writer... You are too."
