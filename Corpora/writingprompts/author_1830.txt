I don't believe in stats.I never have.I mean sure, I believe that the government hands all new parents an official "Succinct Test Assessing Tendencies" packet, but I've never let anyone else define me.My path is of my own making, and I have only myself to blame for my current situation.It really is frustrating.People think that luck is this all controlling thing - a "free ticket" to an easy life.But is isn't.High strength doesn't let you lift houses.High intelligence doesn't let you make inventions that violate the laws of physics.I'm just...a little luckier.Honestly, the most annoying thing is probably being banned from all forms gambling.Most games operate on razor thin margins, and an extra 5% chance to win a coin flip is enough to wreck their business.The problem is that humans don't understand probability or randomness.Don't believe me?Fine, do this.Make up a list of the result of 20 coin flips, and write down "H" or "T" for each one.Make it look random to you.Now, flip a coin 20 times and write down the actual result.Reply with both of your strings (don't tell me which one is which), and I'll bet you I get it right almost every time.So yes, the "luckier" candidate won 3 out of the last 5 elections.Yes, that is 60%.But there was no reason to blame those of us with high luck.We aren't criminals or a danger to society.We're just people, worth of dignity.But I guess we're here for a reason.Luck is being in the right place at the right time, even if you can't see it until later.My path is here, and it is mine and nobody else's.So the question isn't "should I be here?"but rather, "why am I here?"___

It's been a year that feels like a century.I still don't know why I'm here.Maybe it is to learn from others how to use our luck.But how?For what purpose?I feel like the answer is drawing closer.We don't get much news, but things seem to be breaking down.Shortages.Riots.Taking away the outlet of the people's discontent doesn't actually solve any of the underlying problems, so things are surely starting to bubble over.There is a meeting tomorrow, a big gathering of all the "prisoners" with the warden.Rumors flying around.We're being released (what luck, right!).We're being executed.We're finally being told why we are here.___

Morning.Time for them to tell me why they think I'm here.I still haven't decided."Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm sure you have felt without luck this last year."I'm not sure.I know I did at first.But I've learned more than I thought possible from being around my kind.Our luck makes learning skills a little bit easier too - takes just a small bit of the "edge" off of the initial failure that comes before success.Maybe that's my path - to be a "lucky learner?""I am here today to tell you that you are the luckiest of all citizens.For you were sent here with a purpose.You don't yet know this, but our world is drawing to an end.Our odds of survival are dim, and it was decided that the luckiest among us would have the best chance of survival.And it will soon be up to you to forge a new path across a dark and unforgiving terrain..."
