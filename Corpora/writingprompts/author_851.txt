Five words.Five words that would change the world.The Old Gods had returned.At first the world did not notice that anything had changed.They assumed that global warming was a result of man-made carbon emissions and pollution.They thought that the increase in violence and strife was a result of burgeoning religious fundamentalism or a desire for democratic rule.The effects were subtle, and humans among all the other animals in the world are the most egotistical and narcissistic.Of course they were causing these problems.They were wrong.Of course, it took something more than just people killing each other over religion or the Great Barrier Reef dying to realize this.On November 12, 2017 a being suddenly appeared over Baghdad, Iraq.It was a nebulous dark mass of smoke, tentacles and fire.It's red eyes stared over the ancient city from over a mile above the ground.The world panicked.Humans by their very nature are good at ignoring things that are unpleasant.Death and existential dread first and foremost above them.They could ignore these no longer for they had become manifest.We're not sure if it was the scientists or journalists that first named this creature, but it came to be known as Thanatos.The god of Death.The creature did not move for 24 hours, the fires of its eyes never dimming nor closing.After one day to the very second, Thanatos opened its mouth and screamed.The very earth cried out in pain and a massive earthquake struck, destroying homes and killing hundreds.Before the ground could calm and the sound die down, a dark smoke began to issue from Thanatos' mouth.As the black mist wafted down it began to compact and spin away from the larger mass of smoke.These pieces hit the ground like midnight meteors, throwing up dirt and dust.Many people were outside trying to avoid collapsing buildings so they noticed fairly quickly the *things* crawling from the various craters within the city.It took days to get a picture of these children of Thanatos.They had killed everyone.***
