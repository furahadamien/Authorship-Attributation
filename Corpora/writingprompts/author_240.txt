Hello, I'm Jane and  I want to tell you my experience of the horrible event we all had.Losing my sight and everyone else losing theirs was horrible.People had many names for this sudden event - The Great Blinding, The Killing of the Eyes, The Greatest Wipeout of All Time.It all started with me waking up and realizing everything being blurry.My hands were starting to move, my legs starting to shake, my chest starting to wobble.I eventually fainted.No one could save me.I couldn't walk around, or else I would probably get a concussion.Where am I?How am I blind?Why is this happening to me?This is torture!!!I'm the only unlucky one, why is it targeting just me?I swear at 2am, I had perfect sight!With the help of a GPS, I went to a community centre and helped raise awareness about complete blindness.Only then would I realize that  everyone there had the same problem too and everyone they and I know had the same problem.2 years later...

After 2 traumatizing years of complete blindness, with no warning, I had perfect sight, even better than before the event.But I see a hidden message on every wall saying - Don't Tell Them You Can See.I realized that people from another world made everyone blind so they could invade without getting in trouble.But an alien accidentally threw magic powder on my house which somehow made its way to my tummy that made me feel better.The aliens supposedly wrote a message to not tell anyone because people will be angry.But I've told you now that everyone is better so, bye!
