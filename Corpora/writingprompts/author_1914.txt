Blood stains the cement as my partner and i load the dying man into the back of the ambulance and we speed off to the hospital.My partner Peter has been with me for the last fifteen years and truly, he is one of my closest friends as of late.He too was a vet though, he doesn't know thats another thing we have in common.For I was in eastern europe during the height of the 30 year war.Many people were dead and medics were in high demand.That's where i came in, a not too well off kid on the battlefield helping men to their feet or sometimes ending their suffering 
permanently.One day however i became seperated from the battalion during a patrol and came upon a dying old man who seemed out of place.His wounds were fresh and just like any caring individual that lives to mantain life i treated the old soldier, his outfit not matching the time period at all.and upon finishing his wounds he smiled at me softly, and i smiled back understanding his unspoken words when i focused onto his eyes.Horrible grotesque eyes from something dwelling deep, deep in the ocean depths.He waved a slow goodbye as i awoke in my cot in a sweat but shrugged it off as a nightmare until 6 months later when the same old man appeared to me as i was preforming surgery.He spoke in a gravely and ancient voice.His words coughing up insanity and sea water, it dribbles into the open cavity
"Let him go my young disciple, and experience my gift."My mind said no but my hands willed their way to his artery and i subtly slice it without the nurse knowing.My thoughts are reeling as he bleeds out.I scream for gauze and make futile attempts to stop the bleeding when all at once a wave of pure ecstacy rushes through my being and into my very soul filling me with unknowable knowledge both terrifying and old.I regained my facility's instantly not giving too much away to the nurse.The old soldier never moved once but his alien eyes stare at me and he smiles.For years after i stumbled upon the secrets to life every time i treated people that wandered in the middle lands of limbo.Their wounds and suffering sings to me like a heavenly angel telling me delectably terrifying secrets.The reason i brought this up is because that man that died on the table for this was my best friend during service.This precious gift requires the blood of the people i hold dear.As the years went on i found myself more and more lonely.Now these days i try really hard not to fufill the requirement again.For such a price is becoming more and more taxing on a man who cant die.But hell, what can i say?Nothing is ever free, and who knows maybe ill make a friend again after me and Peter go on our yearly hunting trip this weekend.
