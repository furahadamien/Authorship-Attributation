I looked back at all the things.They were flashing by my field of vision in an absurd pace and clarity at the same time as if my synapses had one big, final crescendo to compose before the very last deadline.Every turning point, every decision, every lasting image came crashing down onto my conciousness with the acceleration of the ten story fall I was witnessing this very moment.It started slowly; familiar faces as seen from a low point of view, absurd details of stuffed animals I held dearly as a child, my mother.A lot of her.Then things were picking up pace, as was my life: kindergarden, school-based pressure, the divorce, Bob Marley-fueled lazy afternoons, the breakup with Anna (a lot of her, too), business school, my first job, managing my first hedgefond.But the imagery wasn't melting into a blur of colours; I saw everything frighteningly clear.My conciousness shifted.This was no longer me falling, this was me observing myself fall.At the very last moment, just before this 'me' persons head hit the ground, I snapped back.My tentacles slump, I let the bong fall.Every last bit of power is sucked from my body.I look at Glrgrumrgr and mumble:"Hrly gshhet drood.I'm nt d'ing this gshhhhet 'gain."Then I pass out.
