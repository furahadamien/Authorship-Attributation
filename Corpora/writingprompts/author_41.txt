Char-Lez
Life was grand in 2038.Bitcoin had replaced central bank currencies.Cancer had been cured.We established permanent bases on the moon and Mars.Self driving solar cars had replaced most autos.There was not a single armed conflict in the world.The oceans had been cleaned up.Starvation was a distant past memory as was malaria, and even the common cold.Then they went back to 2017 and ruined it all.Now we live in polluted poverty while the world rages in war and famine.Those damned fools.
