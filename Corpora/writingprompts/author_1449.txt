Brad and Chad, the ultimate Bros. Their actions although epic did not fit within the confines of faith in Jesus christ.They worshipped a false prophet.In a false church.The church of iron.They were brotegs of the master broffesor, Samson, who taught them everything they knew about seeking the holiest of all holy thing.The pump.Brad and Chad spent all waking hours of their lives perfecting their faith and form within the confines of the church of iron until building themselves into the tank top wearing, muscle flexing, cut from marble false idols they were.Jesus, being concerned with the following these false idols produced, ejected them from the apostles in hopes that the hordes of muscle bound heretics Brad and Chad had conjured would not distract the world from the one true salvation for humanity.
