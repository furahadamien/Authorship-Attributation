24 hours.You'd think that a complex lifeform higher than that of a mayfly would require more than that to mature, and most importantly reproduce.But no, it can be accomplished within a mere 24 hours.24 hours to go from infant, to adolescent, to adult, AND to find a mate to pass on genes, carry the young to full term, and birth a new generation.How else can a species survive otherwise?So a human is born.Instantly they somehow consume a massive amount of calories to gain the mass required to grow through their incredible lifespan, and the rapid development of the biological systems make mere infants become self aware in mere moments after birth.THEN, after self-realization, education is somehow instinctively realized.Somehow.Allowing the children to know exactly the social expectations in order to find another human of an opposite gender to reproduce with, all before they fall asleep and die.Because if we only live for 24 hours, that is what it would take for human society to exist without going completely extinct within a few weeks.
