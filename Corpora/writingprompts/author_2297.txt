A deep shade of red was the last thing I saw as my eyes closed tightly, never to open again.The paralyzing agony that seared through my veins, centred around the deep gash in my throat through which the slowly coagulating fluid was gushing.I could feel the warmth of the blood trickling across my chest, dying my favourite white dress red.It had been a night of completely bad decisions, was one of my final thoughts...I knew when I left my home only a few hours ago that it was a bad idea.What was the point in going out to a bar this late at night when I had work in the morning?Why had I decided to take that shortcut through the back road instead of just walking the few more blocks in the safety of the streetlights?So, as I lay there, blood saturating my brand new dress, I allowed myself to feel nothing but regret for leaving without telling my mother where I was going?Who would tell her what had happened?Would she be okay?Barely eighteen and dead, what a twist of fate.Red was the first thing I saw when my eyes opened again.That wasn't expected - was I in hell?I couldn't think of anything that I had done in only eighteen years that could equate to a lifetime of burning flames.I was corrected quickly when the red that obscured my vision began to shrink only to reveal itself as one of those hideous glittery ribbons that perched itself atop the head of a young girl with long blonde hair."Wha..." my voice came out in a garbled mess, too quiet and hoarse to be my own.Her wide eyes were alight with something I hadn't seen in my own in many years - innocence?"What's your name?"She asked in her little soprano, not waiting for me to answer as she continued with her line of questioning, "I'm Ellie?Are you my new friend?Will you play with me?"Surrendering myself to the order disguised as a question, I nodded and followed her over to the small round table surrounded by dolls and teddies.The ground below my feet felt like air, too soft and light to be normal.When I looked down to see the pink carpet through my transparent heels, caked in mud that thankfully wasn't being trailed across the room.Specifically, the pair of brand new scarlet heels I had bought only that morning - I couldn't even bring myself to be too surprised; nothing was typical about this situation.Was this my life for the foreseeable future?A child's invisible playmate?Oh Christ, was my old imaginary friend really a dead old man?That was so wrong!"Your dress is so pretty!"With that thought, I wondered what I looked like; if I was wearing the same heels as I had when I had been murdered over only a purse holding nothing more than twenty pound and a half used lip balm, chances were, my looks would be scarring this little girl sitting opposite me wearing what could only be described as a childish expression of curiosity.I hoped for her sake that there wasn't a huge gaping hole in my throat, at least.With a final sigh, I forced a smile onto my previously red painted lips and lifted the tiny teacup that barely fit into my hand, raising it to a position where we could clink both together, 

"Cheers."----
