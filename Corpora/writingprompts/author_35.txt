Ajit Pai lied back on his throne and sipped his goblet.He roared in laughter Soon Net Neutrality  would be repealed, and every link on the internet would redirect to a picture of his face unless people payed money to make it go away.Suddenly, a group of brave souls appeared out of nowhere.Mr.Pai, we came from the year 2038 to stop your reign of terror!In the future, we have to pay 1000 dollars just to browse Google! the man charged towards Ajti and threw a phone at him.NO!Calls to your senators!My only weakness! Pai started to melt away.I almost got away with it, but you brave group of future resistors foiled my evil plans!Curse you, the C.I.R.C.L.E.J.E.R.K.E.R.S!!!!! and with that, he melted into a pile of goo.Great work gang!Now lets go stop EA! The members of the group pulled off their masks, revealing none other than Bernie Sanders, Elon Musk, and Dan Harmon, as they raced off into the night.
