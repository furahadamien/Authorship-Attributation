Did I get hit on my head?Because thats what it feels like - the worst hangover of my life.Dad, come and fix my playhouse, please?It keeps crumbling down.You never set it right!, screamed my daughter from the other room.She is home?I am home?How did I get home?Someone at the bar must have dropped me home, I guess.I need to get up on my feet before the ceiling eats me up, I must get to my daughters room before she screams my head off!I walk in, shouting, I did set it up yesterday.You are the one who keeps pushing and changing....Wait, why is her hair wet?Why is her teddy wet, too?Why are all the cups and chairs scattered?Ive had it with you!If your mum was here, she wont have ever tolerated any of this.You wouldve had better manners, you little witch!No more games! 

She got flustered.But dad, you did all of this.I just wanted to have my friends over but you werent happy with it last night!You forgot again, didnt you?

I wasnt happy?Listen young child, just because I dont remember much about last night, doesnt mean that you can make up anything you imagine.You did all of this.

No dad!Dont you remember you came home late last night, and couldnt walk properly up the stairs.I had to help you all the way to your room.But you got angry at the hallway, when you glanced over my playhouse.You were angry at teddy, too.You kept shouting and screaming, and I asked you to stop.But you wont listen!

Did any of this happen?Why cant I remember anything?You are pushing it!Youve also kept taps running in your bathroom.How many times have I.., words fumbling down my mouth.But dad!You opened the taps.Dont you remember anything at all?

I stormed into the bathroom, to close the taps, and then it hit me, when I looked at the floating blob of hair in the bathtub.I remembered nothing, but I knew what I had done as I closed the taps.I locked the bathroom, and walked back to my daughter, as I could hear sirens not far off!I hope you forgive me.I dont remember what Ive done.

Dad, will you stop being so melodramatic and come fix my playhouse?My friends are coming over for tea, soon.
