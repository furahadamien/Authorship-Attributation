I wish I hadn't run that mile for PE.The extreme fatigue wasn't even the worst part.As I got done, and began walking to the drinking fountain, I took too big of a breath, and began to choke on my own saliva.I guess it had a lot of mucas, because no amount of coughing or swallowing could fix it.I tried to talk, but I was out of air.I began to panic, so I went to the fountain and attempted to drink water, but that only made it worse, and caused more fluids forcing their way down my lungs, if everyone around me cared to look out of the palms for two seconds, maybe I could get out of this.Before long, I passed out, I guess nobody cares to see if I were okay, and that's why I am here telling you this.Make sure not to choke on your tea okay?I'll try, she replied.She grabbed my hand, and led me into her room, with her dad sitting on one of the six chairs around the table, 3 of which, were occupied by some of her stuffed animals.Leaving two empty for me and my new friend.Her father looked detached, like he either didn't want to be here, or he was preoccupied with something else.After we sat down, she poured all of us a cup of invisible tea (really addictive).After about 10 minutes of conversing, and learning the proper edicate for drinking tea, the dad began to look at his phone.At first, it was a glance, or two, then, a peek, interrupting conversation, followed by a few actions, taking no longer than a second.Eventually, he stopped playing, and just sat on his phone, ignoring us.Each glance at the phone infuriated me, but now, he would rather spend time on his phone, than with his own daughter?!I couldn't take it.She and I had planned for this."Ready to wrestle with Daddy?"I asked her.Eagerly, she knoded.I pointed at the knife, she grabbed it, and jumped onto the table.I watched proudly as she leaped onto him, stabbing him in the chest and face.He must have been caught extremely off guard, not knowing how to react, she stabbed until he lay there.Motionless.She must have thought that her dad was playing dead, and that the knife was fake.I pointed at the chest in the corner of her room.She moved it, revealing a large space, that soon was taken up by her father.I pitied her.Her "father" is awful.After she washed up, I told her to tell her mom that "father" had left on a surprise business trip, and didn't have time to say goodbye.Weeks later, the mom had stopped being worried, and assumed her husband had left her for another women.As her mom kissed her goodnight, almost vomiting from the stench.She began to bolt to the door to avoid throwing up, when she noticed the dog, who stopped being allowed in her room since it would claw up the carpet around the chest.The mom decided to see what the dog was up to, and after looking in, around, the chest in every way possible, she decided to move it, revealing the source to the stench.Her mom grabbed her arm, forcing her outside into the car I made sure that she grabbed the knife on the way out.While inside the car, I told her my plan.Not too long into the drive, the mom pulled out her phone.That made me experience an anger unlike any I've felt before.I told her to do it now."What about the plan?"She asked.I told her it's too late for that now, and to do it now!She stood up on the floor of the car, and put her mom in a headlock, and before she could do anything she stabbed her in the chest.She hesitated for a second stab, but I knoded, and she stabbed her again and again until she lay static.Soon after, the car lost control and went into the on coming lane of traffic colliding head on with a semi.
