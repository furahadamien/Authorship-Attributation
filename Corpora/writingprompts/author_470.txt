The revelation that struck the world was three-fold.First, that Aliens existed and we were not alone in the universe.Second, that they had already taken an interest in us and we were powerless to prevent them from interfering in our lives.Third, that the poster-child for international and interplanetary adventure had been stolen away from us.This.Could.Not.Stand!The Bring Him Home Movement didn't necessarily instill world peace but it did instigate a new level of international cooperation and funding, the likes of which had never been seen.In a little over a year, outposts had been set up on the Moon and Mars.Humanity had a long way to go to get their man back.SETI had finally parsed alien communications from the cosmic microwave background and they were narrowing down a direction for the Invaders.CIA and Bletchly Park cryptographers had the signal about 50% decrypted.Blackbriar was reinstated with a focus on training interstellar operatives.NASA had developed a theoretical framework for breaking the speed of light.Ten years later the Sol system was unrecognizable.The intelligence gained from tapping into the galactic internet had pushed humanity forward ten thousand years.Dozens of planetoids and moons were swarmed by darting ships.Strangely, many large vessels were surrounding the planet Jupiter.A short time later it disappeared, replaced by an ship-sized visual disturbance in space.They had created a warp gate that could take them anywhere in the Galaxy.Humanity had broken free.*Somewhere in the Norma Arm of the Milky Way*


Matt Damon woke up to another day.Being abducted by aliens wasn't nearly as exciting as one would think.After being used as a traveling exhibit by that disgusting cockroach, Kim Jung-il, he had managed to break out on his own  and landed himself in "galactic Hollywood".He currently starred in the galactically acclaimed soap opera "Good Monkeys Hunting".It was about a monkey who could solve mathematically-centered murder cases.They were in their seventh season, and all things considered, life had gotten routine.And that's how it happened that he was commuting to the studio when what appeared to be a star destroyer appeared in orbit.The races of the Galaxy now refer to that day as D-Day (for Damon day, duh).It was the day they lost their favorite monkey star and humanity began their unstoppable march across the Galaxy.
