' Adopted is the best  ' 
To be honest, no one in my family except my sister and me like the street dog we adopted, they think the one which has a renowned breed is a good one.Well, I think that thought is lame, lame as f*ck.Yes dogs can be really unstable sometimes, they get excited when they see new people, Yes they jump, Yes they're clumsy.Judging a dog by it's breed and the way it looks is something very stupid to be judging at.I'd like to see if the kids they give life to, be judged by the way they looked or just taken in as one of their own..'Adopted is something you take in out of love and having some sympathy for it. 'So please stop judging, cause true dog lovers don't do such a thing.Oh, your dog listens to whatever you say, well mine does and doesn't sometimes, not everything is meant to be perfect.Oh, So help your God, I saved something that was about to leave this world 2 days after it was born.I managed to do something, I filled up a void in that thing's heart, So ask yourself this, ' Did you? 'Yes my dog is black.
