"Oh damn!It's Darkblade!"The desk officer's light blue shirt erupted in a fountain of red as the hungry blade whistled in a straight shot that managed to take the neck.It might have looked as if the weapon had missed its target, had it not been for the wake of red that sprayed from the wound.The officer had tried to put pressure onto the wound, but the man was upon him.The blade had already returned to his hand.When the curved tip plunged into the heart, the man with bone-white hair looked upon his victim and said, "You're welcome."He yanked the blade from the chest.His adroit step had managed to dodge the second deluge of red liquid and he was lucky that the desk had served as a buffer to catch any yellow liquid that might have fallen on the merciful killer's boots.His dark eyes narrowed as the limp head struck the desk before the body crashed to the floor.He was in the business of resurrection and blood, but he hated the idea that his work had to be so... messy.It had been the third week since the man with bone-white hair took up the blade.His hair had not always been that color, it was a stable dark brown.He (for before he began the work, he was a man) had average looks and average brown hair.Not only had his hair changed, but his figure was also now lithe and skin pale.He could feel a certain sense of confident grace with the way he walked.His eyes had sharpened, their warm walnut color had changed to near black.Though his blade looked like an angry blade, a weapon of hell's arsenal, what was shown to him was anything but.His 'mercies' as he liked to call them were for the better.Even if the other two cops he had come across had dropped to their knees and drawn their weapons.The shot had woken his sense of the presence.The shot was near the mark as he felt the hot sting near his forehead.His back was against the wall as he hurled the whispering blade at the shooter's partner.The knife whistled its tune of greetings as it plunged in the thick chest.With a thought, the blade extracted itself in a burst dark red cloud from the chest and returned to his hand."You won't get away with this, murderer!"The officer shouted before he fired twice more, "You think you can just cut your way through the world?""I'm here to collect what I can.I could make this painless if you would just stop shooting at me.""And let you get close to stab me?Go to hell!"The cop replied with both words and a shot that sent splinters of wood in the air.The man blinked when he heard the officer swear, followed by the soft metal clink.He knew that sound, a revolver chamber had been lowered.He kicked off the wall and rounded the corner.As he burst into the wider office he saw a large gray conference table in the shape of an oval, a pair of cubicles in the towards the bricks made of frosted transparent material.Behind him were another pair of cubicles and a raised dais where a fifth desk lorded above the others in the room.There was an officer alone, dressed in blue with a cap laid on the table.He had one round the chamber when the man had leaped belly first on to the table, slid across, and plunged the blackened metal right between the officer's eyes.The bone haired man neither smiled or frowned at his work.He was but a pawn of dagger's whispers, "Be reborn on the other side, friend.Receive my master's mercy."He yanked the blade and tilted his head to avoid the spray.Another soul saved before the storm that would exterminate both the world and soul."Hey!Hey!What's going on in there?Let us out!"A voice cried from the door ahead of the man.He rolled off the table and stood.The tail of his long coat trailed behind him.The knife was not content to giving him the dark eyes and sunken features of death's agent.It had given him clothes of black or dark gray with an oyster gray coat.He had one hand in his pocket where he drew a handkerchief to clean the hungry blade.His lips pursed as he heard someone cry out."Can one of you guys check on us?"The voice said.He could tell by the words and the sight of bars that ahead of him were prisoners.Despite a deep sense of elation at more souls to shower with the knife's mercy, he also had to learn of their hearts.The wicked did not need to be reborn and he had other ways to spare people from the coming storm, such as fire.
