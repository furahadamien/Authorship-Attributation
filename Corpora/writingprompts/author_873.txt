It's been almost three months since we somehow managed to catch the legendary time freeze killer, and we've gotten nowhere figuring out how his powers work.The fact that we managed to catch him in the first place seemed so weird.He just popped up in the middle of a bank vault and was quickly overpowered and detained.My only explanation is that there must be some kind of limit to his ability to stop time, or rather that he doesn't have full control of the ability.The trophies he kept on his person of his victims confirmed his guilt of the double murder one month prior.It's clear that his sanity is quickly deteriorating in captivity.His control is getting worse, it seems.We've kept him in an as secure cell as we can, but several times he has almost managed to break out, only for him to pop up right in front of a guard.He is getting more and more paranoid, repeatedly screaming about murdering someone.We can't examine him properly, but everything points to the man he always talks about being another personality of his.Lately, as his control weakens, his powers seem to have turned into a curse.Some mornings we find him severely dehydrated lying on the floor with his hands covered in dried blood, with bloodied dents and marks left on the cell door.I can't help but feel sorry for him, on the verge of death every other day and constant self-inflicted injuries.Even a man that brutally killed a woman and her son can't deserve this kind of torture.It's clear that he, at least now, is severely mentally ill, but we can't risk doing most medical examinations, nor are we able to communicate with him when he is being so uncooperative.In the end, we can simply keep containing him and study the little information we have.PS: One of the prison guards seem to have an unhealthy obsession with the prisoner.I've caught him smiling while listening to the prison staff gossiping about the prisoner when he thinks nobody sees him.I have a bad feeling about him.I recommend that the guard is reassigned before he gets a chance to cause trouble.
