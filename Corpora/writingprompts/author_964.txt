I saw her eyes flutterflickering with tears growing out.Could I reject the greatest creation on Earth?Her eyes saw my own, I saw her own innocence glow to my skin, as I felt her tug to my jeans.She had asked for thousands of dollars, yet her eyes were millions worth alone.Would cynicism be my sin, or my lies?These were the options that the beauty of the world granted me with, yet mere seconds were left before the silence became a clear 'no', without a word said.Damned if I do if I don't, but damn me if I deny joy.I chose lies for my damnation, for a sin is equal to a sin.But, even in this impossible spiral of my sickening actions, I saw those eyes...by god...those eyes.I saw the world glow before my eyes, as if this singular portrait of myself was justified by bringing rightful joy to the best portion of myself; my daughter, the sweetheart.She ran to her roomrunning towards her desk.I saw this, but joy of life was damned by my own grim reality; I couldn't provide the girl with her rightful joy...I couldn't bring happiness, only a lie and a couple of words, and a couple of hugs, for that was the only thing I had to give, so I'll give it all.Damn it, I'll give it all.Two Days Later.Christmas was one day away; the eve.My eyes bagged as I saw the girl smile to the world; bringing the only light to the world that I could ever be granted to see.As the hours passed by, the bags grew deeper, and I saw her face slowly become far widerfar happier.I wondered for what I could do about her joy.Is it an inevitable damnation; my misery, or perhaps it's a rightful punishment for destroying the world of the greatest person on Earth.Could I save her from myself?Could I ever live up to that smile, or will by bags grow wider than her smile?Damned if I do, if I don't.Christmas Day.I saw her sleep, and I could feel her smile, even if she never did at night, I saw it; its potent joy that spread not from her face, but rather from her heart; the sweetheart.I prepared myself coffee; black, after-all, black is better than sugar.It's also cheaper.I sat on my couch.Two hours, and I get to see my damnation."Knock, Knock", I heard from the door.At this time, I readied a bat.At best, it's her mother, at worst it's my death.I made sure that whoever was at the other end could here rattling of small piece of metal that I kept near the dooron-top of a shelf.That, along with muscular grunts were a constant routine.The peephole was cracked, so I cracked the door less than half an inch.I didn't peep threw, not until one last grunt.It was a pinata, a Christmas Pinata.Nice.It was a gift, I could only suppose, although, I kept it at the door stepkicking and scraping at it for awhile.With no preparation, the pinata snapped out of its shell!Inside was a fiery demon that screamed with it's gaping teethfar larger than the mouth itself.Its horns grew within seconds of lighting its fire.They resembled horns of gods, and were uneven deformations that raised its height past my head itself.I couldn't scream, my jaw was locked with worry and awe at my daughter's eyes.In the demon, I found hatethe feeling of death's sorrows that he fed upon, and reveled in other's despairs.I stood still, for my emotions were passed reasonable reaction.It walked inside without a doubt in its mind.I stood there all night.I wondered what I've done to deserve hell?I heard her come downstairs.Was it screams that I couldn't hear, or perhaps the fate of their meeting?I sat with no other questions in my mind."It's a puppy"!She hugged the flames.No reaction.I saw the world fall apart.
