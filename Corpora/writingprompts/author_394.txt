"You, come with me please.Jim!I'll just have a chat with this guy, okay?"Jim, the closest thing to a neanderthal you could see outside of a museum of natural history, flashed a thumbs up before going back to checking ID's."So uh, like, what's the problem?"I glanced at the man beside me.He looked like your average guy, jeans, a white shirt, a healthy sunburn covering his face.In fact if I had been average as well, I'd probably never have picked him out in the first place."Just a routine, random pat-downs to make sure our guests aren't armed.You don't mind, right?It'll just take a minute"."Ah".His face relaxed and his shoulders visibly untightened."Yeah, sure, no problem, it's your job.Where to?"I gestured for him to follow me and we started moving towards a room Jim and I got to use for our breaks."So, you been here long?""Nah, just arrived.Got tired of my job and went on a road trip with my savings.You know, new faces, new places..."

"Yeah, I hear ya."I unlocked the door and we walked inside.It wasn't big, more of a closet than anything else, but there was enough room for a small plastic table, two foldable chairs, and an IKEA-shelf with a coffee pot and a cake Jim brought a few days ago."Sit down, you want some coffee?"I poured myself a cup and offered him one."No thanks uh, shouldn't we be standing up for the pat-down?""Yeah, there's not going to be a pat-down.I just needed to talk to you."His shoulders stiffened again, eyes wary."Yeah?About what?"I sipped the coffee and made a disgusted face.It was cold."What do you want to talk about, man?"He tried faking a smile."Do I look underage or something?"I laughed."Close, but no.See, I'm good at my job.""Yeah?""Once I started working here, there's been a severe decrease in injured guests"."That's great"."There's also been no underage drinking at this club since I started working here.The local kids don't even try anymore, I'm that good at telling peoples _real_ age"."Yeah?"He kept my gaze, looking increasingly like a deer cornered by a cougar."As in I can see exactly how old people are"."You mean..."

"Yeah.I hate to paraphrase twilight on you, but you haven't been underage in a very long time, have you?"He didn't move, shoulders still tense, eyes locked onto mine.The numbers above his head, the numbers indicating just how many years he had been alive, the numbers I had been able to see above everyones head since the day I was born, read 2709.He breathed."Fuck"."Yeah.Now tell me: What.The fuck.Are you?"
