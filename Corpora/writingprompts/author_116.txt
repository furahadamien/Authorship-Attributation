ExilePrime
This is the beginning of self-awareness.You grab your seat and as a sit down a screen appears informing you that you must live here until you can predict two movies.There are restrooms and entertainment in the back.When you leave you will have your last life, your eternal life never to study the effects of your time again.

I have been exiled from the future, that is my fate if I can not solve this riddle.Some say it's the riddle of forgetting.Some say it's the riddle of miracles.Some say it's the riddle that science solves.We have all survived perfectly in a sense.Considering the different variables we've had to solve.We've overcome every obstacle in our evolutionary path to get to where we are within the entirety of time.Jumping through dreams has a certain ware on the mind.We feel this by forgetting information from the previous dream.Our infant selves, rich with the special life energy we began with, had more control over that one element, forgetting.Through our evolutionary path on another level from our birth in time, we evolved with a greater power, survival.As time outlasts all things, our days to extinction are not getting any shorter, unless we can evolve past this conundrum.Different great peoples through out time have made different attempts to solve this riddle.From every civilization to every community.Tribes have been formed towards this one purpose.The closest known discipline to solve this issue was Alchemy.
