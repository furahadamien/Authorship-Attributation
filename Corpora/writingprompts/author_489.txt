My first thought when I saw what the creature was how hideous it was.Their flesh is bared save for their heads and sparse throughout, and their language was still comprised of primitive gruntings.I almost pitied the miserable creature, but there was something in its eyes \-\- some kind of defiance I hadn't seen in a prisoner here before.I tried to tell the guards but they shoved me down and said they didn't need the advice of someone who cleans up shit for a living.Shortly after they locked him in his cell, the warden arrived to "initiate" this Matt Damon as he did every valuable prisoner.The warden had grown quite prosperous with the galactic slave trade, and had even supposedly acquired decrypted copies of recordings featuring this alien.I suppose he thought he knew the capabilities of Matt Damon.He was wrong.I felt a chill in my spine and closed myself into the maintenance closet to watch through the window.As the warden attempted to tase Matt Damon, the alien began to levitate in a seated meditation position.He raised one arm with the index and middle fingers full extended and they began to glow an amber hue.I watched in terror as the warden and prisoners began to burn.I could feel the heat from inside the closet, yet the alien seemed unaffected.He began to phase through the bars and float towards the control center, all the while emitting radio\-waves from a small handheld black box.As the flames began to die, I made my way towards the escape pods near the back of the prison ship.As I ejected and was jettisoned out into space I saw the ships of space pirates descend upon our vessel.The ships all bared the image of their planet with their banners drapped around it.The last thing I saw before becoming completely lost in space was the alien being beamed back up to his ship.He looked me in the eyes and smiled as his ships resource\-mined ours before blasting off to pull the same scheme on another crew.If you're receiving this transmission, please send res>!cue to !<coordinates X\->!195.576 Y\-562.111 !<Z\-995.947.Keep an eye out>!for these Earthlings!!<They're a war\-obsessed species with agents of >!chaos and magic.Avoid confrontation if possible!!<
