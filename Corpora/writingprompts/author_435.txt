By now, those old enough to remember the days before didn't want to go back to it."It caused nothing but trouble," says my grandmother, aged 78.For the most part, I could see that.The history books certainly made it seem that way.It was a barbaric civilization back then.But surely, we weren't the only ones who had advanced since then, right?The rest of the world 

Aah, there it is.That mythical "rest of the world".No one had seen it for half a century.Just America.Many said we were the best country in the world, but how could we compare based upon 50 year old information?But, my grand father could recount it like it was yesterday."UNIVERSAL ISOLATION" it said as the headlines.Canada was given Alaska, Hawaii was given to Japan, and California was given to Mexico.It may seem like a lot of land to give up, but gramps was just glad the war would finally be over.Of course, there was a great deal of political panic.But, after those with dual citizenships chose a single nation and those in the field of translation and other international occupations were paid a fairly large sum as ruled by the last (or, well, so we thought) international committee, everyone seemed content.They had to limit the range of the internet.No more global news.It was nice.Without the distractions of the other nations, we were able to make gigantic strives in technological and political advancement.But today was it: opening day.The whole world would be able to intermingle again.So imagine our shock when we found out we were the only ones closed off!

The young boy took the little toy truck and rammed it into another."Boom!"he screamed in his childlike excitement.He then walked over to his anatomical toys.He took, ever so slightly, a piece of plaque to continue an ever-so-slow process of plaque accumulation.His model here was on his way to heart disease, but he had another 10 years at this rate.Bored, he took an action figure and another."Pow!"he exclaimed, as one figure bent over in pain, being shot by the other.The young boy was just one of many of Death's children.You could say there were thousands.Though time is of no issue, it would take too long to get to everyone to die for just one person.And it was a lot harder now to go about things, being exiled and all.Oh, it's been thousands of years to be sure, so it's not like Death hasn't coped by now with the loss, but just don't mention it in front of him.
