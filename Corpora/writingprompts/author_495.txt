"...Get outta here..." Emily said, amazed the bee spoke.Even more suprisingly, she heard it not with her ears, but her mind.She looks at the bee again to see it flying away."Not LITERALLY!"She says.The bee comes back and asks again, "What are your orders?""You can speak.So you are sentient.Do you have a name?""Buzzooka Joe, your Highness.And the two keeping watch outside are Chad and Larry," he says."What is your next order?We are short on time."Emily took a moment to think about this.The memories of all the years of neglect without knowing why.All the painful experiments and disgusted looks she received for as long as she could remember.It was not hard for her to come up with her next order."All those who abused me, keeping me in here like a caged animal inbetween those horrid tests.....f*** them.F*** them all."As the bee flew out the window,
Emily began smiling, imagining what her revenge would be like.It wasn't long before she began to hear screams.But something was....off.The screams were not from people in pain.Rather, they were the kind people make out of disgust.Emily looks out the window to see the chaos below."NOT LITERALLY!!"Edit: My first attempt at a writing prompt.I always wanted to do one.So please don't bash me TOO hard.
