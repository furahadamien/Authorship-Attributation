I laughed nervously.I shouldn't have done this -- the summit was all but over, broken for a brief recess before the final terms had been agreed to.Diplomacy, it was being called, although it was more like Earth being bound in shackles."Fascinating," the alien finally said, the gills on his neck flaring.It blinked, and I fought off a wave of revulsion -- their eyes were too *large*, too empty, and this alien was currently staring at me.After another long, awkward moment, the alien leaned down to get closer."Is it true you can only see three basic colors?"The alien's question was almost *conspiratorial*, a vast difference from the bland tone of the meeting."Three colors?"I nearly laughed again, but opted for clearing my throat instead."No, we see much more than that, although it is true that all the colors we can visualize are based off of three primary colors."The alien was mostly silent, blinking slowly again.They were all like this.Every action seemed deliberately slow and calculated."So then how do you communicate with *Ghoosha*?"The question caught me off guard."With *what*?Goo, er, gusher?"I couldn't quite pronounce the word properly.Human mouths weren't formed for the delicate words and pronunciation of the aliens' language.The alien's gills flicked outwards for a moment before resuming their gentle sway."*Ghoosha*," it corrected, infinitely patient."The other major race on your planet."I bit down on my lip, hard, desperately wanting to laugh.Another race?Not possible -- but the aliens never lied.They were careful, pragmatic creatures, and either didn't quite grasp the concept of lying or dismissed the act of lying entirely.Some of us were convinced it was the former, and that the aliens were a gentle, childlike race without a proper grasp on human actions.Over the course of the summit I had seen some world leaders treat the aliens patronizingly.The aliens hadn't seemed to mind, responding to every question kindly and thoroughly no matter how contemptuous -- but they never lied or mislead.That meant that the *Ghoosha*, whatever they were, were real.It was my turn to pause.The alien waited for my response, gills swaying.It took me another moment to collect myself."We are unaware of the goo-shaw.This is something we should discuss more thoroughly once the summit resumes."The alien blinked slowly, gills curling at the tips before unfurling.Their features were broad, flat, and grey, as was with most of their kind.It was hard to register emotion -- any emotion -- at all, even with how large their eyes were.Yet it seemed, almost, as if the alien *pitied* me.They blinked again, clear eyelids stretching across their eyes."Yes," the alien said."We should.But may I ask another question?"I glanced at my watch."If it's quick.We resume in four minutes."The alien blinked again."What color am I to you?"I raised a brow.Trick question?No -- it had to be related, overall.The aliens didn't ask without reason and this would be no exception."Grey," I responded, glancing at my watch again.The alien waited, patiently, and then it clicked -- "We can't see them," I said flatly, looking up at the alien again."Yes," it responded, and this time I was sure of it.Pity.It colored their voice."It seems we have so much more to discuss."
