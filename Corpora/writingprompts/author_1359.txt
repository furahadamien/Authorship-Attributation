Doctor Harris!The Andomians have sent a signal again!

Harris looked up from his lab, where he had been busy designing an FTL drive shaped crockery holder.What are they saying? He asked with excitement.Did they reply to the broadcast yet?

No, they're finally on their moon!They seem very proud. Captain Samuel Stevens told him.Harris snorted.Only took them two hundred years after inventing heavier than air flight, he said, unimpressed.I'm giving them a millennium before FTL.

Others aren't so hopeful.Do you want to leave that on the moon for them to find? Stevens asked, pointing at the cutlery dish.No!I've got a better idea.I developed a form of nanobot, indistinguishable from regular microbes, for them to discover there.I estimate that it'll take them fifty years to work out that they're fake.

It'll do.The Galactic Ministry of Pranks is putting more pressure on us.Did you know that the crew of the Destination managed to convince an entire species that their sun was due to explode in twenty years?The exodus was a level three, or so I'm told.

Smug bastards Harris remarked darkly.An idea struck him.Here's an idea he said slyly.You remember the fake Doomsday Bomb we made for the Muvarians?

What about it?

It never landed, remember?The Muvarians saw straight through it, and the Galactic Empire had to gamma-scorch their world before they nuked our orbital monitor satellites.What if we deploy it for the Andomians?They're nowhere near as close to Muvarian technology.I bet we could trigger a level four exodus with that!

Agreed! Steven pulled up his comm device.Officer Adams?One false Doomsday Bomb to beam down, please!


My first story, so please be gentle!
