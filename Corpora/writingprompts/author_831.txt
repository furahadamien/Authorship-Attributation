"Tell me where it is!""I don't know!I don't know!", I cried as I got another kick in the gut, protected by nothing but the rope the chackled me with.Apparently, the thing they want from me is  a valuable jem hidden somewhere in my house.I thought the previous owner was shady, but who'd think he worked for mafia!He probably took it with him when he moved, and sold the house for cheap so a blockhead like me would get beaten for him."Boss, I think he's the wrong guy."One of the thugs started to doubt."He's the one.The adress is right, and Mike would never lie to me."Guess, it's my unlucky day."But you're right.Burn this place to the ground.We're getting out of here."It definetly is."I told you he sold the house and ran away with the jem!", I cried as my last attempt to survive."We know.We were just checking if that were true.But now, you know too much.So... We have no choice."Finished toying with me, he exited the room; his minions started to spill gasoline; and I lost it."Is this the end?"I murmured to myself."Will I die like this?Because of a misunderstanding!?Toasted in my new house!?"I heard a quick "chick", and saw a burning match falling on the floor.The room lighted bright red, and the two black silhouettes locked the door from the other side.Now I'm doomed.Surprisingly for me, the two silhouettes weren't the last black I saw in my life.From every angle, I could see black goo stretching across the room.It seemed intelligent as it opened the door, the window, and the knocked down furniture in such a way that it blocked the fire from soreding on me.Then, I felt lots of tiny bumps under me, and the room started moving.No, it's me!I'm moving!That's where I understood what the black goo is.You see, from the small age, I learned not to harm a living thing.Every life is sacred, and even the smallest bug has a soul.So my whole life I was letting them outside, carefully taking them in my hands and putting them on the nearest bush.Later, mom told me to whisper "Today you, tomorrow me", and one day they will come to save me.But not that literally!!!The bugs lifted me up from the ground and carried to the window.Then, using their super-strength, they tossed my huge body a meter to the air right through the window into the hands of a swarm of flies and mosquitos I've let feast on me and my food; before I could realise it, the flying mosquito matress put me safely on the ground and bit my ropes off.Now I was witnessing the hellish furnace that was just my room, and my savior coming out of it in the face of black goo spilling down every crack on the street.One day later, I was back at my old place, happy that I didn't tale everything with me to be burned with the new house.I turn on the TV and see my face on the screen."One man turned down the largest crime organisation in the city".For this act, I received compensation for the damage, and then some for the organisation.With so much money, I couldn't think of anything better to fo than to donate them to the animal saving groupes.Especially insect ones.They deserve a thanks._______________________________
