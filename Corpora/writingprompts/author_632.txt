All I want to do is die.You see, I know all about death, as I have killed myself in every way you can possibly imagine over the last 3,490 years.You heard me correctly...nearly 35 centuries have passed since Every time I do it, every cell of my body reassembles and I wake up...again.Im a bit of an oddball.You see, I was 28 years old when I was recruited by the Northern California Chronorium Distribution team.I know what youre thinking.Yes, I broke the law; I let everyone down.Ive suffered the consequences more times than I can count.You can help me to make everything right.But first, let me explain what I did all of those centuries ago and why you are reading this now.One day, my mother, Mary, was driving to work and she witnessed the aftermath of a horrible accident.Two cars had collided at high speed.One car had stopped burning, and the other was resting on its roof on the side of the embankment.The forest in this park of Oregon was thick, and both vehicles were hard to see from the road.Mom was an RN at the local hospital on her way in for the night shift.She got out of the car and ran to the first car as fast as she could.The driver of that car was an elderly man who had massive lacerations and had likely died on impact.It was beginning to get dark, so she could barely make out the passenger: a young doe that had probably caused the accident.My mother then heard something that would literally change the course of history: a small child crying out in the night.Mary investigated the other car and immediately recognized the passengers as Marty and Marlene Zerkin.The Zerkins were career criminals that used to live next door.Marty had been arrested on suspicion of murder and had spent 5 years in prison for armed robbery.Marlene had also done time for elder abuse.After a young girl disappeared in town, so did the Zerkins, whom had met their fate this evening.Mary new immediately that the voice she heard was likely their son, Marty Jr....me.I was two years old at the time.I dont remember any of this, only what mom told me when I was 16: she had decide to raise me alone.She had an opportunity to divert the death report of a young man two years later while working an ER shift.She changed her name to match my new identity and moved to Phoenix.Not only did I learn about all of this on my 16th birthday, I also learned that I was 18, not 16.I had always been a scrawny little guy.Marlene had nearly starved me to death and my growth had stunted.So much of it made sense: why I had always felt so different and why other kids seemed immature and stupid at times.To her credit, mom was ready to come clean.She would have admitted her fraud knowing that her little boy had grown into a young man.She gave me the option to tell the truth.I chose to get my GED, drop out of high school and eventually go to med school.I protected mom and perpetuated the lie.So when it came time to give patents the serum, I was offered a chance to be injected by a colleague.A good friend of mine worked at the FDA, and she told me that the age restriction data was fabricated, and that it was all an elaborate scheme to give the government time to figure out how to control the population.As you may have guessed, she lied.Not only does the drug have unusual side effects for those over 26 at time of injection, it had a very unique effect on me.A rare genetic mutation  combined with the drug to create an immune system and chronetic anomaly that made me immortal at 28.The LessThans died of natural causes at the ripe old age of 230.Some did make it to 250, and today colonists at Alpha Centauri live to 240 or more, on average.I, on the other hand, have the curse of immortality.I was a fool.I have met four others like me.We all stay far away from each other because of the myths that follow ya from century to century.I currently live on Io, one of Jupiters moons, in the year 5508.I am part of a research team that has made a breakthrough in time travel.I have been secretly working in this area for over 500 years, changing my appearance through black market nanosurgery.Anyway, my goal is simple: to alter my timeline so that I was never born.Ive tried going back in time to murder Marlene and Marty before I was conceived.Ive even got back and murdered their ancestors.Nothing works.Oh, Ive changed  your history.You would be amazed how much.It hasnt always been for the better but Ive tried, I really have.But playing God is wrong.Ive gone mad more times than I remember.This is where you come in, dear reader.You see, I can alter the timeline of everyone but myself.Its a discovery I will make nearly 32 centuries into your future.You have the power to stop my misery and keep your own timeline the same.In exchange I will provide you with a time travel device and the latest life extension technology available in my time.You must be 26 or under, that much has not changed.You are reading this right now because I have made a device that allows me to connect to one of your ancient computing devices in a remote part of Earth known as Greenland...Ironically not very green?Anyway, converting my speech to your ancient language has been a chore...so crude!I digress.The Remote Temporal Transmission device allows me to communicate with you.I am under immense scrutiny by the Martian Science Authority.I have to delay my communications with 2018 Earth by exactly one year.Next June 25th, Marty and Marlene will meet at a bar in downtown Portland, Oregon.All you have to do is prevent this.You have one year to prepare.On June 5th, 2019 I will send a second transmission with the exact time and location of their meeting.Im counting on you.Please help me find peace.
