"I'll be back at the end of summer."He was leaving in the morning."I know.""It's been nice to get to know you, Brad.""You too, John."We sat on benches in the quad, nursing illicit beers and in the shadows of a faraway street lamp, shivering a little in surprising chill, late-semester stillness belied by the pounding in my heart.There wouldn't be an end of summer, after all.Not on this world."I - it's just you know.You've been such a rock, after Julie," ...he turned away.I heard him take a breath."She didn't deserve that.She was such a good person.""I know.""And it's scary.""I know."Julie had died a few weeks earlier, been found with a single would to the neck in an alley off campus, her favorite ice cream barely melted around her."I'm glad they say she didn't feel a thing.""I know.""And all the others ...""I know, John."We sat still then, my heart still pounding."John --" I reached out, and touched his shoulder.He turned and looked, dark eyes a little red with tears under wavy brown hair.He looked at me, expectantly, not seeing the hand under my sweater."I love you.""I love you too," he said."No, I mean," I said, slipping the dagger out from the sweater's far side, still carefully hidden from view.I looked in his eyes, down the lines where neck met his slim frame."It's, ok, Brad, you can tell me anything.""I'll \*always\* love you, John," I said.And I felt like it was my life that flowed out, and not his, as the flash of betrayal flew from his eyes into my heart, broken and hoping only that one day, he might understand.
