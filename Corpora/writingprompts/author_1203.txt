I sigh deeply as tears begin to well in my eyes and I'm faced with a decision.After texting my mother last night and telling her I would be over to her house in the morning, before spending the afternoon with my boyfriend's family for Christmas, she responded with two simple texts:

"Ok"
"Don't bother stopping by.Enjoy your Christmas."Nothing hurts more than being told by your own mother on Christmas Eve that you're not wanted at home on Christmas.After rereading the prompt, a single tear escapes.A complete stranger has more empathy for me than my own mother.The world is an interesting place.I then chuckle softly and whisper quietly, "Thanks, Reddit."
