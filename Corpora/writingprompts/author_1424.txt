Live by taking lives
Die by giving death
I executed my duty, each time a body gave up their function I was there to ensure it would cease to live.Each time a child took a wrong step, each time someone drove drunk, each time a bullet severed blood vessels, each time a neck was ripped apart each time shrapnels blew a head each time a bomb obliterated a limb each time each time each time each time each time each time...
An eternity I did what had to be done, not thinking, but working.Living by taking lives.Then the work abruptly slew down.Wilted leaves unable to take in the light.Rotten teeth unable to chew the greenery that lies dead before me.No body to be reaped of their life by me.I had free time to watch the remants, free will to observe what was lost, free control of what I was to do.Die by giving death.I was alone and I decided to watch the wilted leaves get blown away by the wind, wo has no soul but still moves and will move even if I were gone.When no more leaves were visible to me anymore, I started walking, unsure of where to go.I listened into the void of souls.Please, I dont want to die, somebody, anybody.I heard the voice of a kid, surrounded by the few remaining dogs that survived the flash.I ran towards him, thinking of nothing but fulfilling my duty.I stood, waited for the Kid to take enough damage that taking his soul would be easy.First one stray dog bit the kids leg, bringing him to fall down.The next dog grabbed the childs arm when he tried protecting his head.The third didnt reach the kids neck before getting beaten by an adult arm when I suddenly woke up from my trance.The smell of death was no longer in the vicinity but the stench of many unwashed people replaced it.What was I doing?Waiting?For what?For whom?For the crying child?For the grown-ups?For the dog that is being beaten right now?I dont know.The trance overcame me and next moment I took the lifes of some vegetables that were thown into a pot.A child looks at them with big eyes.His leg and arm have bite marks.I approach the kid.He eventually changes his target and starts playing with the mud next to his bedding.I grabbed the mud and twirled it in my hand.The kid stopped playing with the mid and followed my hand.The mud floats.I let it drop.His eyes were fixed on the little pile I made.What was that?A ghost?The kid seems confused.I fall in trance again and wake up after reaping the soul of an unlucky rabbit.I returned afterwards to the kid.Hes older, his beard os growing.Scars decorate his tanned skin.After he gets to bed, he looks at a pile of dirt, wellkept under a small makeshifted roof.I remembered and I grab the mud.The kid jumps up and grabs the mud I was holding.His hand slips through mine.I fall in trance again and wake up later.The kid sits with other people telling them a story of a kingdom long gone.I fall in trance once again.I wake up next to the bodies of a bear and two men.I fall in trance and wake up next to the kid.Hes looking at the pile of dirt and wets it with water.I remembered and grab the mud.The kid jumps up and grabs more mud which he puts on my hand.The mud stays on my hand, coloring it brown, revealing its shape.The boy is surprised.Whos there, who are you.Since when are you here.Did you save me on that day?Im confused.I have no tongue, I have no voice to tell my story.I etch with my scythe into the ground.You posess a tool.I need a tool.Can I have it?My mind starts to get cloudy, the trance returns soon.Not yet.Not now.Die later, fly.Die later, pig.Im talking to someone.I look into the boys eyes.His eyes are fearless.I look into my hands
The scythe got muddy.I stretch out my arm and put the scythe into his hand.He needs it.He wants it.Hell exist.I dont need it, I dont want it.Ill perish.I let go of my scythe and fall to the ground, losing my power.The boy looks at me, first confused then scared then frightened.I was falling apart.I was losing my conscience.I was giving up my existence.I was dying.I was giving life.He was taking death
