It happened again.Sound ceases.I never notice right away, but as I come out of my fog, I notice the world is completely motionless.The static state of my surrounding is not the hardest part to get used to; its the complete lack of sound.How do you describe the feeling of hearing absolutely nothing?Not even the voice in my head exists in these moments.My thoughts are only images.The first couple of times this happened, pure panic set in.Was I going crazy?No.Something more is happening when time freezes for me.I take what I feel are the necessary steps to get to the bottom of this phenomenon and set up an appointment with a shrink.I was convinced I was losing my mind and a second party might be able to get to the bottom of it.After many visits, it was clear the doctor didn't believe what I was saying.I still took some of the advice provided.The first tool for piecing the puzzle together was documenting when time froze.January 15th, 2017 was the first time I remember because It was the birth of my child.I remember every single moment of that day.My wife screaming and pushing with all her might.Me, trying not to pass out as I watched her push a human out of her body.The doctor telling my wife to push while the nurses held her hand and offered encouraging words.My child was finally delivered into the world.I notice the doctor looks worried and I do not hear my child crying.I ask if everything is okay and begin to worry.Suddenly I hear a long high pitched tone and nurses rushing over to my wife.The doctor is still trying to get my child to inhale its first breath.The walls begin to close in on me and everything looks 1000 miles away.I hear a gasp, a crying babe, and then nothing.I lost my wife that day, but she lived on through our child, Jennifer.That was the first time it happened: time freezing around me, or moments as I now call them.I thought it was the stress of the situation, but over the years it continued to happen.I learned that the moments would pass and I was the only one aware of them.It has been 16 years now and I have documented 246 moments.I have become obsessed with finding what causes these moments.They all have the same qualities.No sound, everything around me is frozen in time, I can still see everything, and no one seems to have any memory of these moments.Moving objects in a moment is a tricky thing.They are frozen until I touch them, but for some reason what I touch begins to heat up and the longer they are in contact with me, the warmer they become.Now, since there is no sound, that tells me sound waves are affected by these moments.The sound waves are being frozen but I can still see, therefore lightwaves are not affected.I found heat and cold are also not affected, but that could be because of my touch.I took notes and performed experiments.Nothing made sense and the puzzle pieces never seemed to fall into place.I was consumed and obsessed.Everyone thought I had lost it.The state agreed.They came and took my child and there was nothing I could do.No matter how hard I fought or what high profile lawyers I hired, they took my child.I became unstable and the moments came more frequent, growing from 3 or 4 a year to 15 or more a year.I thought about suicide but the moments would always intervene."What am I missing?"I would ask myself."What thread have I not tugged at?"The moments were getting longer and longer.I was aging faster than the people around me and I was running out of options.I was only 38 but I looked closer to 50 because of the moments I had experienced.To the outsiders, it looked as if the crazy man was wasting away before their eyes.A moment came and I tried to wait it out, but it felt it was never going to end.I got up from my chair and began to walk.I had no destination, but it seemed my body knew where it was going.I walked in this moment for days and arrived at a small house just on the outskirts of town.I was hungry and I hadn't had water in days.I was dying.Would this moment end?Is this how I finally go - in this moment?I walk up to the door of the house and push it open.I walk in to find a woman sitting on a couch crocheting and what appears to be her husband reading a book.My body knows this is where I'm supposed to be.I look to my right and see a flight of steps leading to a second floor.At the top of the steps I see several doors, but one stands out.There are stickers and drawings tacked to the door and it looks to be a child's room.Its pulling me in.I can feel my heart racing in my chest.I walk to the door, turn the doorknob, and push the door open.There is a woman in her late 20's sitting a bed frozen in time with her eyes shut and her face pointed towards the floor.I take a step into the room and the woman lifts her head and opens her eyes.Her mouth moves but I can't hear the sounds coming out of her mouth.She stands and all the sound returns to the room.Its disorienting and I struggle to get my bearings.Its what a imagine shellshock sounds like.The woman in the room has her arms around me trying to help me stand and her voice slowly comes into focus."Dad!"screamed Jennifer.
