"Oh, gee golly Miss Molly!I think I went and summoned one o' them there devils!"screamed Walter as his saucepan glowed molten red and the demon materialized upon his stove."Foolish mortal!Doest thou think thy prayers will be answered!There will be only suffering!"The demon, a ghastly, pig-like creature shrouded in shadowy black flames marched toward Walter."Oh golly gosh, Mr. Demon!I didn't mean nothin' by  it!I was just followin' Granny Necro's recipe!See, it's all here in this book."Walter flipped to the page in question.The demon grabbed the book, his claw searing Walter's flesh."This is the Necronomicon.You were reading the Necronomicon.The page is literally titled, 'To Summon a Demon'.""Yessir!A spicy, chicken-y demon in m'belly!Just like Granny Necro used to make!"Walter rubbed his belly, thinking of his childhood, when Granny Necro, clad in her favorite black robe, would give him a delicious soup on cold, rainy days, made with chicken broth, her special blend of spices, and the blood of classmates he would bring to her house."There's no soup in this book, dipshit.It's the book of the fucking damned!"The shadowy flames surrounding the demon intensified."Oh, Lordy!You're gettin' real mad there, Mister Demon!I know!How's about a human sacrifice?I'll be right back!""What?Nah, man, I don't really go in for that shit..." but Walter had already run off into another room.The demon awkwardly looked around the kitchen."Linoleum... Kind of a modern-looking pattern.I wonder if they got the work done in the last few years.Contractor did a decent job.Hard to find good people these day-"

"MISTER DEMON!"Walter bounded into the room, with a young child in tow."This is my daughter Kelly!I offer her to you, Lord Darkness!Take her soul and spare me!""Dude, I don't really wanna-"  but it was too late.Walter picked up a nearby cleaver and embedded it in Kelly's skull.She fell to the ground, her lifeless body twitching as her eyes glazed over."DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK!OH MY FUCKING GOD!"The demon recoiled in horror."What the fuck is wrong with you?!"Walter went pale."Oh golly gee, I really messed up bad.You don't like it?Not a big fan of human sacrifices?Maybe you're one o' them cannibal demons?I got an idea!"Walter chopped off Kelly's hand and threw it into a frying pan.He added butter and salt, flipping it occasionally."I know you THINK you've eaten tasty children before, but wait'll you try my Kelly!I kept her chained up in the basement most of her life, so the meat's real tender.""I don't wanna eat your fuckin' daughter, man!You... you got problems.This is some fucked up shit, man!"The shadowy flames had largely subsided.The demon no longer looked so frightening.Still, Walter was not encouraged by this.He had another brilliant idea, and ran out of the room.A few minutes later, he returned, with a young infant in his arms."Oh gee willickers Mister Demon!Ok, so you don't want to eat my Kelly, that's fine.I can tell you're a demon of impeccable taste!Only the finest children for you!See this?It's my son, Adam!Barely a month old, this one is!"The demon backed away, fearing the worst."No, Walter, man, listen please!I don't wanna eat any of your kids.Look, I'll just go, ok?No more demon.You win!Just don't hurt the baby, man."Walter, however, would not be deterred."No, golly, Mister Demon!You just THINK you don't wanna eat my kids.But Adam here, he's still got that soft spot on his head.You can just crack him like an egg, see!"Walter held Adam by the feet, and dropped him onto the hard, tasteful linoleum floor.Adam's head split right in two.Walter picked up both halves, offering one to the demon, while sipping the blood and cerebral fluid from the other."Mmm!Tasty AND nutritious!Come on, Mister Demon, try my son's innards!""Fuck!Fuck!You just killed a fucking baby, man!You're fucked up in the head, Walter!You got problems!I...I'm tellin' Jesus what you fuckin' did, man!He's gonna fuck you up!"With that, the demon vanished in a puff of smoke.Water huffed."Gee golly, the nerve o' that fella!I invite him into my home and kill two of my children for him, and he just leaves!Oh well, his loss.More of my children for me!"And with that, Walter happily continued to eat his dead infant child's brains.
