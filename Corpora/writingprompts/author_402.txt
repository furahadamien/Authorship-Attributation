You find out some interesting things as a bartender.My bar isn't a big bar or a hotspot for college so we don't really need bouncers, my partner, Frank is intimidating enough to keep riffraff from starting.He never understood how I can spot even the most crafty of fakes though.Truth is, I don't.I can see people's names and ages above their head like it's written on a post card.Funny thing about names though, my power sees people's nicknames, so I don't rely on that, not to mention it weird people out when I mention their names without knowing them.Though that does help me catch fakers.You see, while there isn't a college nearby, there is Korean town, and Korea has an interesting way of determining age.When they are born, they are already 1 year old and then upon their new year, they reach 2 years old, so if someone was born the day before, upon New year they would be 2 years legally without living a fill 24 hours.Because of this, I always check IDs of those my power seems underaged by about 2 years.If their surname matches and they look Korean, and the ID looks like them, and isn't obviously fake, then I let them drink.It can be difficult considering I see age in days, but I know the amount of days it takes to be that old, give or take leap years into account.Like I said, you learn some interesting things as a bartender._______

One day, an older fellow, looked about 40-50, dressed dapperly, walked in.I blinked when I saw his age.*This gentleman has lived over 8 million days?* I thought to myself.*Thats about 22 thousand years!*

"H-how can I help you s-sir," I asked taken aback.Frank looked at me knowing something was up, but I tapped the table telling him to act cool.This is usually the code for undercover cop."Ah yes good chap, I would like your finest draft.Do you brew it here yourself?"The gentleman inquired.Thomas was his known name, but his family name isn't in any language used by humans, it looked like a pair of angelic wings."No," I sighed, "the nearest brewery supplies us with several kegs a week though, would you like a pint or a pitcher?""Just a pint for me, thank you.""No problem, I just need to see your ID.""Well surely you don't think I'm underaged," Thomas said chuckling into his well trimmed mustache.He gets it out and shows it to me."Well you can never be too certain, especially with the drinking laws getting stricter this year."I reply with just as much heartiness in my voice."One pint coming up"

I poor the beer and engage in conversation with him.About the time the factory workers get off and start filling in he bids adieu and leaves after tipping his bowler hat.He left a generous tip, $500 was left for a bill of $25.___

Over the next year he became a weekly regular, but always dodged personal questions.He was quite inquisitive about how I was able to spot fakes as well, though it only came up thrice while he was their.Most kids try it when we're busy thinking I will slip up.Towards the end of the year I find out I have stage 4 cancer.I only have a month left to live and I frequent the bar less and less each week, leaving it to Frank to handle it.Then I am hospitalized and Frank closes early one day to come see me, and Thomas was there with him.As I'm on my death bed, Frank says his goodbye, he is a stoic individual, but I know he will miss me.I don't have a family so I leave it all to Frank.I turn to Thomas and he speaks in an ancient language, yet I understand it."Hello my Lord," Thomas speaks, " it is nice to see you again.""That it is old friend, is my time hear up for the century?"I inquire."Yes, did you find Humanity worth sparing for another hundred years?"He asks taking anmore serious tone."Yes, even though they have killed so many of themselves, again, I still love them as my creation."I reply.Those were my last words, until another hundred years pass, I will remain in heaven doing my duty, then I will live again on Earth to make sure humans are still worth saving.
