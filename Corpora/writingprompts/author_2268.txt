Pieter Panikov must die.I thought this while standing over the corpse of another of his lost boys.The young man was splayed over his laptop with a gaping hole in the back of his head.I knew when we yanked the hard drive that me and the others in digital forensics would find the usual, stolen music, games, and movies amongst an encrypted dark Web file.Seriously, what did this prick have against piracy?Heck if it wasn't for piracy I would have never ended up on the force.Never would have made it to captain of cyber crimes division.There might not even be a cyber crimes division.And here we had, the fifth lost boy found with a lot less on his mind than he started with."Jimmy,  did they check his pockets?", I asked stupidly.Jimmy Shu Mi, my partner scrolled the case file on his smart phone, after rolling his eyes at me.Of course they had checked, but this was our first time at one of the actual crime scenes in the flesh.Ugh, grizzly metaphor.I've been in many a LAN party or late night Dnd session, killed endless npcs and digital enemies.You can read about the smell of death, but breathing it in is a different bag.Jimmy found the file."let's see, this was Lance Yohan.Alias 420yoloswagsalot.Last seen by his mother in 2013 playing his big brothers game console version of grand theft auto five.She said she heard the then 5 year old swearing loudly into the mic something awful about the other kids mother shortly followed by silence.When she went in to check on him later he was gone.Hmm, notes say the mother was a notorious alcoholic and that child family services had been alerted to her regarding negligence previously... "

There were many such cases.I had a file full of them.Didn't get the name lost boys right away, but when I started to collate data, three things stood out, that they were lost and they were boys.And that many of them had been deep into video games, left alone too young.Alone on an Internet that leaves young minds vulnerable.Perfectly vulnerable to the likes of Pieter Panikov.Some said that Panikov was as much of an alias as anything, but the MO was the same.Get them young and recruit them in his toxic cyber gang.Brigade forums.Hack multiplayer games.Sew dissent and discord for the lulz.What stood out was their strange hatred for pirates.And when some top contributors to basic torrent sites started getting doxxed and harassed by these L0$+ b0zz they had friends in Hollywood and Washington who were quick to call them heroes.Then the killings started.The language turned darker and darker.Even the RIAA had to back off in their support.Panikov's youtube videos became weirder and weirder.Fascist imagery stopped seeming so ironic.They started claiming that they were the true Americans.Co opting indigenous iconography and juxtaposing that with Hitler youth stuff.Real low level edgy art student intro to anthropology stuff.Then there was the dust.No one knew where it came from.But it tore through the underground fast.Replacing crack coke crystal meth and even knocking a dent in the opiate epidemic.Too bad it wasn't much better for you than any of the aforementioned.That's what made me captain, when I linked growing dust epidemic to the lost boys which lead to the arrest of one of the main sources, a lady named Tinker Belle.She had yet to reveal her manufacturing methods or where she learned them.And her capture had earned me a direct message from someone claiming to be Panikov.It read simply, "I'm coming for you".I back traced the op did a whois look up and came up with nothing but proxies.Whoever he really was, he was good.But I had seen what this prick was up to, and I was sick of it.I was gonna feed this kid to the feds.Peter Panikov was going down.Or my name wasn't James Hook, police captain and white hat head of the municipal cyber crimes division.
