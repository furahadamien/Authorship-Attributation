Do you remember all the Oreo contests?The ones where if you had the special cookie design or special colored filling you had found the proverbial golden ticket?As a kid, I was obsessed.I spent all my spare money on Oreos.Package after package.My parents thought it was cute.My friends thought it was awesome.It was an obsession that paid off.I found one of the winning cookies, and I won free Oreos for life.Every month, I received a shipment.The postal carriers would make jokes about the oreos, and I would laugh and give them a package.This went on for years.Until nuclear war broke out, and the country was obliterated.I survived, so did my father.But we lost my mom and my sister.We only survived because we had gone to tour a college campus that was in the middle of nowhere.Far enough away from the epicenter of the blasts.We lost everything.We couldn't go back for months the area was so irradiated.We, along with other survivors did what we had to.Raiding, stealing dad even had to kill someone.The first package of Oreos, sitting alone on a shelf in a looted out store seemed like a joke.We took them, and enjoyed talking about mom and sis as we ate.The second package was less of a joke.We still had a functioning minivan, and when we returned to it, a package was on my seat.Over and over for months, packages would appear in places they had no business being.We thought we were being stalked.Hunted.But no one ever came for us.So, eventually we just accepted the Oreos and moved on.Until yesterday.The package we found yesterday had been opened, and on the inside of the peel back top was a note.A note summoning us to the Oreo factory in New Jersey.So now, intrigued, we are on our way.r/LandOfMisfits

Part 2:

The trekke took us months.Even though we had a functional van, the roads were in horrible shape.Burned out husks of other cars sat desolate on the road.We didnt hurry - I mean, what?Was the world going to end?Again?Still, the steady stream of Oreos continued.No more opened packages, no other sign that we had been summoned.Many times Dad asked if I was sure that I wanted to go there.He felt we were being led into a trap.I reasoned that we had been eating the Oreos for months.If someone wanted to hurt us, all they had to do was poison them.Its not like we checked anymore.We saw few enough people that we had let down our guard.I did wonder though.Why me?I had been a small child when I first won the endless cookies.I had thought maybe at first it was someone from our past, but as we travelled farther and farther away from our home, that likelihood decreased exponentially.Not to mention the fact we never saw anyone leaving the packages.It kind of reminded me of the Santa figure from my childhood.As we passed through DC going north, we passed through one of the largest reestablishment settlements we had seen.More people than we had seen in a long time.Full camps of people, most of which warned us off our journey north.Philadelphia, we heard, was where the first bomb hit.We would have to travel through the irradiated zone to get to the factory.We stayed in the camp for a while, trying to decide our next course of action.That was, until the rate at which the Oreos appeared rapidly increased.First it was one when I was walking, then another on a bench that I was just about to sit on, then a whole pile on my bed that night.Whoever needed us there was in a hurry.We were on the road again the next morning.We chose to go up the coast, as close to the ocean as we could.At some point we had to figure out where we were going.We knew that the cookies were baked in New Jersey, but honestly, neither of us had ever been there before.I sure did miss the internet.We had maps and postcards and stories of people who remembered from before the bombs.Together, we were able to form a picture of where we were going.Just north of New York city, in a place that I thought was part of New York State, a small town called Fair Lawn.Traveling in New Jersey had been hell.Dad had gotten sick from the radiation, and I couldnt remember if I had hair on my thighs or not before we entered the area.Reaching Fair Lawn was like a breath of fresh air, something that I could only recall from memories.We found a nice home to stay in, evacuated at some point with the owners to never return.The house we chose even had a bathroom decorated with Oreo paraphernalia.We had a good laugh at that one.We slept well that night.however, we woke up to a pile of Oreo packages on the ends of each of our beds.After we dressed and walked outside, we saw something we could hardly believe.Thousands of empty Oreo packages rolled down the street like dried tumbleweeds, caught on bushes and trees.As we walked to the factory we realized that was all just a distraction to the real issue.We were not alone.Hundreds of people were camped outside of the factory.Many standing in line, holding notes or packages, just like mine.Summoning them here.Just like me.Ever cautious, Dad and I backed up to our temporary home.We debated what was going on, until Dad decided to find out what was going on.He had me stay back, and took my note with him.Now, Ive never been one to listen, so of course I followed him.Just in time to hear, So youve been chosen too?You were also a lifetime supply winner?We all are.

A combined effort between myself and u/Compodulator

The evening was average in every way possible.Mundane.Boring.No rain, no wind, no snow, not even a car on the street or a bark of the occasional stray dog.I could see the neighbors lights through my own window, but covered with a curtain, I could not see further than the window.A message from my father saying he wants to come for a visit came to my phone about two hours ago.He was, and still is what you would call old school, a firm believer that a good host is to prepare an elaborate, large, fulfilling dinner.There was, of course, an issue with this idea: I am not a cook.I am the absolute polar opposite of a high-grade chef.Last time I tried cooking, without any particular effort, I managed to blow up an omelet.How, I will never know.Eggs, salt, some butter and a frying pan equal explosion in my hands it seems.Tonight will be difficult.I pulled out the recipe book grandma had given me during her vain attempt at teaching me to cook.I flipped through, and found something that I was sure, even I, couldnt manage to screw up.Chicken soup.It called for stock, carrots and celery, and chicken.Simple.*I got this,* I told myself.I had nothing in the refrigerator, as not being a suitable cook, I just ordered takeout every night.I guess I would have to run to the store.I glanced at my watch, Dad would be here in another two hours.Why had he decided to visit tonight?And why had he not given a more advanced notice?I hopped into the car and sped to the local supermarket.Hey, Jef.

Jeffrey Hopkins.We were friends well, not exactly friends-friends, more like kind-of-dont-hate-each-other friends back in college.Back in the day we were all inspired by all the documentaries we saw about regular joes inventing world changing devices.Sure, we then learned that The Short History of the Worlds Greatest was not, in fact, a documentary but some kiddie show made by teachers who clearly lost their minds.Kevin!Another party going on?

Not exactly My fathers coming to town for some reason and I have to set him up with a dinner.

He posed dramatically as a ballerina in mid spin The great chef, Kevin Jamesonvichtkin will now prepare a ten-star meal and not blow up the place up for a change?

Hey, that was one time!Five years ago!Will you let it go already?!

Jesus, you fuck up once, and the world never forgets.He even posted the aftermath on InstantenousGrammaphone and refused to get them off before he got ten thousand likes.It took two weeks.I glanced around the store.I knew where the liquor and the party snacks were, but actual groceries?I had no clue.So Jef, where uh... Do you keep the vegetables and chicken?Also, what is stock? Jef snorted, Im sure already thinking about his next post, wondering how he could get himself invited to this dinner.Jef showed me the way around the store, making snide comments about how he didnt understand how I didnt even know the difference between different cuts of chicken meat.He did explain that stock was basically water that had chicken bones and meat boiled in it until it had chicken flavor, but he also handed me a bottle of bouillon cubes, which he explained were like chicken salt.I checked out at a register that Jef opened just for me and walked to my car.I was dreading cooking this soup, and I was running out of time before Dad arrived, as he would expect to eat as soon as he arrived.I take a look at my watch.An hour.Not much, but it has to do.My phone helpfully told me that soup is a bunch of edibles in water, boiled, and served in a bowl warm or lukewarm.Thats really helpful, Jenkins, thank you, now how about some real help?Alright, so what goes where?

Silence.I groan and try again Excuse me, Jenkins, what goes where in a soup?

Ding!When preparing a soup, the edibles must be cut into proportionally medium size before being put in a pot and boiled with water.

These smartphone features should be renamed to smartASS features.Back to grandmas old book it is, I guess.I gently put the car in the driveway and make my way back inside.The book is right on the counter, where I left it before trying to go and get some help from Jef.I pick it up and go through it haphazardly, looking for the the most perfect chicken soup known to man chapter.This thing looks like it survived at least two world wars and one returning of Christ.I find the chapter and read through the instructions twice.It says to *saut* the vegetables.Whatever that means.Jenkins, what is saut? 

It is where vegetables are cooked on high heat in a pan until they soften. 

I figure Ill save time and put the pot on the stove and turn the heat on.I set the book down next to the stove and turn to cut the carrots and celery.I hold the knife in my best impression of a serial killer and get to work.Those vegetables never stood a chance.When I turned around to put them in the pan, the edge of the book was smoking from where I had left it too close to the edge of the stove.I move it and drop the chopped carrots and celery in the pan.Within seconds they are smoking too!I grab a spoon and shove them around trying to prevent them from catching on fire.Its in vain though, as the vegetables on bottom are charred and smoking, and the ones on top are raw.Then the book, which had continued to smoke, caught flame.I turned to deal with it, knocking the pan to the ground.The poor chopped vegetables fall to the ground and scatter, and the ones stuck to the pot also burst in flame.I panic and back away, tripping in the process, nonsensical words flying from my mouth.Ma ze ha hara aze kus ommok?!

Its a phrase I picked up from Dungeons and Dragons.The supervisor doesnt really like it when I use actual swear words, as she puts it, so as part of my rehabilitation program she clearly pulled straight out of her ass, I am now supposed to use this particular phrase instead of good ol fashioned fuck.Im not paid enough to deal with her.I divert my gaze from the stove for a moment to roll on the floor and find my balance again.Doesnt work very well seeing as that one single celery apparently turned into a carpet bomb and covered the entire floor with its leaves.Or whatever that is.All I care is that its apparently a great lubricant and Ill be introducing it to Jenny as an alternative to our usual stuff.When I finally grab ahold of the chair nearby and manage to climb up, the pot is already on fire.An impressive fire.At least three feet tall, scorching the ceiling and slowly spreading in a weirdly perfect circle around it.I dash downstairs for the fire extinguisher that is probably older than I am.On my way down I hear a dog of some kind barking as if it saw a squirrel.How the hell did a dog get in here?Why?Why now?!I get back and pull the pin, spraying all over the place without looking.The fire is gone, the ceiling is a mess, and theres a notably angry guy in front of me now.This is not a normal guy.Even if hes covered in foam, theres no way his head reaches the ceiling like that.Suddenly, I hear an ear shattering growl, followed by bellowing.Pathetic mortal!You have awoken me from my eternal slumber!No longer trapped between life and death, I will grant you one last pleasure before I set this world ablaze!

I blinked.I blinked again.What was that thing?He No it was staring down at me, and I was no small man, at 6 3."How?How were you able to summon me?!"he screams down at me now.I run to the corner, where the still smoldering cookbook had been kicked.I start flipping through grandma's cookbook as fast as I can, and do the only thing I can think of, scream back, "I don't know!!You were supposed to be chicken soup!"It blinked down at me, Chicken soup?

I dont know, my dad is on his way, he wanted dinner, I dont cook, and this looked easy enough. I said in one quick breath.What are you by the way?How did you get in here?

"Counselor Jaxa!The Drani research vessel is reporting unbelievable reading.Initial data seems to indicate a planet with nearly 9 billion of a single species on it!""You're telling me that a system so far away is home to that many life forms?How many exactly?""Not a system sir, a single planet.And... we can't seem to get an exact reading.Could be the atmosphere.It's a high oxygen nitrogen mix.""Send the vessel down for a closer look, I want an exact count in a day."*some time later.A large chamber with representatives from all known intelligence* 

"How dare one planet decide who lives or dies!"One Counselor shouted.Waving its six arms in anger."They claim they didn't know, and I for one believe them, they *are* from that backwater solar system."A tall blue serpentine Counselor spoke up."We have records indicating that the system was informed two galactic years ago."Counselor Jaxa spoke up.He was furious, for his grandfather had died days ago, likely thanks to the breeding scum.He eyed the one in thea middle of the room with distaste.It shuffled its bipedal feet on the ground, darting its eyes towards different Counselors.It saw one who's internal organs were visible, and the creature, who called itself Man, turned a interesting sjade of green and red.It looked at the serpentine Counselor again, hoping for more reassurance, but not came.It made a funny little growl, and then spoke up."How long exactly is a galactic year?"One of the aids pulled out his time converter, and said "one galactic year consists of the galaxy making one full rotation around the singularity point.By my calculations about 250 million of your years."The Man turned a very pale white this time."You said... tw..wo galactic years ago?That was 500 million years years ago!""And?I see no problem with this."Jaxa responded his large pale eyes bearing into this Man."My species has only been around for 200 thousand years.""This matters not.All life is in the balance!Reports say that you have 8.7 million *breeding* species!On one planet!"Jaxa shouted at the puny little thing.There were outraged cries and many suggesting the planet be destroyed for the fairness of the universe as a whole.Few weakly protested but their voices were over shadowed by those who had lost loved ones to creatures who were incapable of selectively breeding.r/LandOfMisfits
