A new dawn fell upon the world, and a single man greeted his final dawn.He was all that remained.The multiverse was incomprehensibly vast, and none of it mattered.Phyrexia would pay for what they did to Earth, and He would make it slow.A spark flared within the man, and the blind eternities opened to him.He was going to take the fight to Phyrexia, and nothing could stop him.The sole survivor of Earth watched five suns set, swearing that he would end Phyrexia once and for all.They tried to kill humanity.They missed one.They will regret this.
