"I didn't do it."That's what they all say in the klink, right?"I was framed!I had a bad lawyer!"There's not a single guilty man in Florence ADX supermax federal penitentiary where I'm currently serving 15 life sentences for shooting up a mall.But I'll tell you a secret.It's true.Ever notice how some people seem to rise effortlessly to the top?That was me.I fell backwards into opportunity, money and women.I was promoted over my peers over and over, my enemies failed and their lives ruined while I floated on a cloud of pure luck.Their envy was palpable, but I was untouchable.I moved in social circles of power and prestige at a young age, still impressionable.I rubbed shoulders with CEOs, presidents and movie stars, I won't mention names but a very famous Hollywood leading man shared information on a tax shelter through a fake religion he was a part of had saved him millions of dollars over the years.I just had to play along with the bullshit and reap the rewards.Of course I would.I'm untouchable.I went to the church headquarters in Florida with my famous friend.They treated him, and by extension me, like royalty.Women, fancy cars, drugs, anything we wanted.They assured me my first $30,000 set of "lessons" would be returned minus a ten percent cut, much better than any tax lawyer could get me, but I needed to go through the motions.I let them strap their bullshit "technology" to me, a kind of "reader" strapped to my head, with wires running to a box with readouts and controls.They had me run through a series of tests, predicting drawn poker cards, predicting dice throws, coin tosses, on and on.I of course knew the correct answer but I didn't want to raise suspicions so I "got it wrong" a few times.They seemed very pleased with my progress.That's when things got... fuzzy.I remember being at a church event, full of glamorous and powerful people flashing their teeth, a charismatic and energetic leader expounding the virtues of the religion and wealth.Then I woke up here.In Florence in a six by eight cell in solitary.The guards tell me I snapped and shot up a mall.52 people dead by my hand.I've never even touched a gun in my life.My name was all over the news, I was a "gunman".I was guilty.I didn't do it.I woke to the sound of my cell door clanking open.Along with the usual smell of sweat and piss, I could smell cologne.Two guards stepped in and pulled me off the metal slab that served as my bed and onto my feet, holding my arms tight.The church leader stepped into the cell and said, "Congratulations.You are one of the very lucky level 100 percenters we've found."I tried to shake the guards off but they held on, fingers digging into my arms."Don't feed me your bullshit.Why did you do this to me?You know I didn't do it.""Oh your crime is much worse than what they are saying on the news.Yes you never killed anyone, in fact those 'victims' were just actors, the security camera footage of their 'deaths' the best Hollywood special effects money can buy.No, your crime is you're too lucky."I stared at him.Those tests.They knew my secret."Look, I know I am.That's not a crime.We can make a fortune together if you could just let..."

He held his hand up.The smug little shit had a smirk on his face."It's far too late for that.Usually we just disappear the very lucky.But in your case, every effort to kill you failed in some way.We went through twenty three assassins--the best in the world--all dead through misfortune and accident.So yes, we framed you.All things considered it was probably the luckiest outcome for you.""But why?"I said."Luck is real as you well know.It's a commodity.There is a finite amount of it.And you have been very, very lucky, haven't you?"He stepped closer and jabbed a finger into my chest.He sneered."Every good thing that happened to you means someone else suffers defeat, and accident, an illness, a death.And you were greedy.Too greedy.So we decided to put you on a karmic diet, so to speak.In here.You'll be safe, your status as a 100 percenter will guarantee that.But you will no longer deprive the rest of us, or *me* my portion of blessings.We who worked hard for power or wealth can't have the lucky taking that which they didn't earn.""Look I can, you know dial it down, I can..."

The leader waved his hand dismissively."We can't take that chance.You'll stay here with the other 100 percenters, besides, you are a mass murderer.Remember?"He laughed and walked out, the guards threw me on the floor and followed.The cell door slid shut.The leader stopped and turned around."I'll be back later for some stock tips.Maybe we can arrange for some female companionship if you play along, maybe you'll get lucky."
