5 years ago, I fell asleep on March 29th and woke up on the 30th with no sense of sight.I remember that morning vividly.I woke up that morning, explicitly feeling that my eyes were open, but they looked as if they were closed.I forced them open but they still showed nothing.I screamed to my parents about my situation but they gave me the same response.Everyone had lost their sight, all across the globe.After that, everythings been blank, figuratively and literally.Well, today started unlike any other in the past few years, I woke up, made my self breakfast only by touch, as I had learned to do, and got ready for my short commute to my school.The Day went as usual, staying in one classroom all day, reading, or feeling rather, textbooks about subjects that wouldve stayed around even if no one had lost their sight, and repeated with different subjects.Then, out of nowhere, I saw.My sights back... And I immediately see text scrawled all over every solid object.It reads:

Dont Tell Them You Can See

The multiple scrawlings of the phrase looked as if they were written in blood, and everyone except me was oblivious.I quickly asked to go to the restroom and exited the class.The phrase still lined the walls, roof, floor, everything.I left the school immediately and rushed home.My parents didnt hear me enter and even my house was covered in the crimson phrase.I rushed upstairs and threw open my old laptop that hadnt been used in years.I searched up if anyone else could see; nothing.I was the only one.What now?I couldnt tell anyone, and no one else can see either.I thought long and hard of any way to figure out why I couldnt say anything about my regained sight.My mind came up blank.I guess I could relive some memories by watching some YouTube?No.I need to find out about this.I went outside and looked around.Nothing unusual apart from the phrase everywhere.**Ill check back in if I find anything new.**
