It's been ten years, and everything has gone my way.I graduated university with top marks, work at my dream job, and will soon be married to the best girl ever.All because of a little green line.You see, following the green line keeps me safe.I never do the irrational or dangerous activities, so I never experience negative consequences.Life is good.But borrrring.I want to have adventure!Not just sit around all day, getting fat and happy.So as I leave work on that Friday night, I stop focusing on the green line.The red comes into view.Green tells me to turn right as I drive out of the parking garage.That'll take me home, where I'll wait for an hour for Jennifer to arrive- she always works late Fridays.Red tells me to turn left, so I do.After a couple blocks of office buildings, the line makes a turn on the freeway, but North instead of South.Rather than take me to my condo in downtown, it takes me to... where?I pass multiple bars, stripclubs, and auto parts stores with no sign of the line even moving.Finally, I'm directed to veer off the freeway, to arrive at the most adventuresome and risky... Home Depot.My confusion is heightened when I'm apparently told to buy a five gallon drum of gasoline and a match box."Need to start a fire?"The cashier jokingly asks."Matches are for a fire, but the gasoline is for my cousins electric generator at his cabin."Idiot, he won't believe that.But he's not saying anything more, and now Red is telling me to drive further from the interstate, and into the Suburbian Jungle.Several streets and a couple turns later sees me pulling up in front of a ranch-style home that the years since the 80's haven't been kind to.I barely have time to look before Red slips under the side gate.Green curves in my vision, twisting and pulling, before spelling out, "TURN AROUND."Green has nice cursive.My hands find the latch, I step through, into the yard.Red leads up to a window, and I peer through.Green vanishes completely, evidently collapsing into a catatonic state.Red marches me back to the car, where I pick up the gasoline, applying liberal amounts to the front of the house.One match later, and the structure burns.I'd like to see the look on Jennifer's face as she notices me standing outside, but Red is telling me to drive.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


It's been three years, and with multiple felonies under my belt, it's safe to say I know what Red does.Green gives me a safe, comfortable life, but one where I am never in danger, threat, or peril of any kind.Red puts me into the worst possible situation, then relies on me to clean it up.I've had to bounce back and forth between the two, as depending solely on Red gets me captured and in prison.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to follow Red.
