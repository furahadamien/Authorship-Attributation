"Look at this display of moral depravity.No wonder Hell continues to grow at an exponential rate."I look at the handsome man who is talking to me, not quite understanding why I am suddenly next to him, floating over the Black Friday shoppers flowing into the big department store.&#x200B;

He nods down at the crowd, finally thinning as they spread out to the other aisles.None of them had even noticed my body underfoot; minds laser focused on their discounted toys and tvs.I suddenly understood."I knew working retail was going to kill me."&#x200B;

He knowingly nods."It happens to the best of you.You try to be nice to these parasites, honoring their expired coupons, repeatedly answering their inane questions.Next thing you know, you're dead because you couldn't get out of the way fast enough after opening the doors to this... " He gestures to the shoppers with a look of disgust on his face, "mob and now you're headed to hell."&#x200B;

I was, unfortunately, not surprised.The devil continued, "The big guy set-up a no win game for you mortals.You went to church for awhile, I'm sure you remember the gigantic list of sins that he set forth."I nodded along with him as he continues, "I have a proposition for you."&#x200B;

Let me tell you - I've never been more excited about a job proposal to remain in retail in my life.Makes sense, though, since I'm no longer alive.&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Time flows backwards to minutes before I was trampled to death.I am once again standing inside the front doors with only moments until our midnight opening, shoppers foaming at the mouth ready to get inside.I gesture for their attention.&#x200B;

"Folks, folks, calm down.I have an announcement."They calm only the slightest, but their noise volume does decrease."I have to let you know that there is only one 60" television going to be available tonight at the $99 price point.The others that were supposed to be available were not received in our shipment."The crowed surged forward with renewed screaming about ruining their Christmas.Chants of "let us inside"  resounded.I looked at the big clock on the wall, about to strike midnight, and pulled out my keys.&#x200B;

This is where the magic happened last time.&#x200B;

Just as I turn my key in the door lock, the clock magically rolls back 20 minutes.With hellfire gleaming in my eyes, I give the crowd a devilish smile."Sorry folks," I explain, "we can't open the doors until midnight.You'll have to wait just a liiitttttle bit longer."Shrugging my shoulders as if there is nothing I can do, I turn my back to the crowd and laugh.This is going to be fun.
