You know, if it weren't for this incident, today would have been completely ordinary.Wake up.Take my pills.Get showered, and go to work.You know, the usual.The Normal.Everything was going great.I was just locking up my car as I got to work, when I heard Her.Only...it was different.Like it was actually affected by the world around me.It was tangible.Real."Turn around.Did I find you?"I turned around, and standing before me is one of the most beautiful women I'd ever seen.She was a brunette, her hair long and curly, and she had a cute little upturned nose on her heart shaped face.Her eyes though, they were something else.They were a deep dark green color, with a dash of hazel speckled in.I would have been absolutely speechless, if it weren't for the burning question deep with in my soul."...Are...Are you really her?Jane?"At the sound of her name, her eyes, her face lit up, her eyes sparkling, as she smiled a dazzling smile, one that made her beauty  even far more evident."Yes, it's me!It's me!"Jane exclaimed."Oh I can't believe it's really you!We have so much to talk about, I-"

She stopped short and her smile faltered.Apparently, she was getting wind of what my current mood was like."Honey...what's wrong?"Jane asked worriedly."What's wrong, she asks," I replied angrily."What's wrong?Gee, Jane.I wonder.I don't know, maybe it's the fact that I'm not crazy, and you're a real person," 

"But I don't understand," she said, puzzled."What do you mean?Why would that make you mad?Honey, I-?""Don't you call me 'Honey', Jane.Thirty-Seven years, Jane.Thirty seven fucking years, I've had you in my head, and apparently you've had mine in yours.I always believed that I was crazy, but apparently *you* were so convinced that I was real, that you traveled to my city and my place of work just to visit me.Where did you say you were from again?Vancouver?Fucking hell, Jane.What are you doing here?We're thousands of miles away from there.Have you ever heard of Facebook?Kik?Twitter?Haven't you heard my phone number a thousand times in my head?At least I have an excuse.Do you know how many Jane Smith's there are in the world?A lot.Even if I didn't think I was crazy, it would have been impossible to find you on Facebook, but I like to think you'd be able to narrow down the choices for *me*.There aren't a lot of people with my name, you know?""Honey, please, I didn't-"

"What did I say about calling me Honey?What do you think this is?Do you think this is some sort of romance novel, where you find me, we get together, get married and live happily ever after?I never asked for you in my head.I never asked for the hundreds of dollars in medication every year trying to get your fucking voice out of my head.""No, wait!Let me explain!Please!""No.I've heard enough from you.I've been listening to you for 37 years.. Now leave me alone.I'm gonna be late for work."And with that, I walked away.
