"GOD DAMMIT!I WAS SO CLOSE TO FINISHING!"My roommate would probably discover my naked hanging body the next day.Of course a piece of trash like me die trying to get off.What had my life come to?What happened to me?I used to be a straight A student but now I am some naked fuck with a rope around his neck."You never tried.That is what happened."The voice came from my right.I turned and could not believe who I saw.Me, but somehow I knew it wasn't me.Because I already knew their name.I knew my name."L...Leaf Erickson?"I asked.But I already knew the answer.Even if I looked nothing like the actual man."It was pretty bizarre hearing about myself in history class.If I had realized it was a new country, I would have never let those Englishmen get to it.""But how are you here?And why do you look like me?""Looks like I didn't get to go to Valhalla.Were dead, and I am one of your past lives.I am not the only famous one though."Leaf pointed to the front row of the theater."That's Marilyn Monroe."The fuck?"How can you be my past lives!You all made something of yourselves.I failed despite everything!Why did I fail if I had your spirits to guide me!?""Talent doesn't make everything.You have to work for success."Leaf said."Maybe our next life will understand that."The screen turned a bright white and we heard ourselves cry.
