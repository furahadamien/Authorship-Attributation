There's a saying.'Hell is other people.'Coined by Sartre.It's not about how we betray each other, hurt each other, or even kill each other.It's about how we judge each other.It's about how we decide who people are, on their behalf, usually with no real experience or rationality, and apply that label to them forever.Even if it's disproven.Even if it was demonstrably false to begin with.We judge because we're judged.And we're judged because we judge.Two men go to work in the morning, each hoping today is the other one's last day, because he's lazy, mean, Et Cetera.Each having no self-awareness, no insight into the other.A mother 'ruins' a daughters life by telling her what to wear.A daughter is 'rebellious' because of what she finds comfortable.Neither considers the other's perspective.Two friends apply for a scholarship.Neither receives it.Neither knows the other didn't, because they both figure out how to pay for school without it.Each accuses the other of cheating him.Their friendship doesn't survive freshman year.Neither can stay friends with such a dirty-rotten-scoundrel rat-bastard.Neither wonders if the other might be telling the truth.We're born.We're ripped out of the peaceful, empty nothingness, and thrust into Hell.We live in hell.We finally die.When we die, we're sent to... Hell?Well, maybe, but as it turns out, not immediately.First, we go to purgatory.Which I contend is just Hell by any other name.I woke up in purgatory just now, millennia ago.I've been waiting forever for the final judgment, which is happening immediately following my arrival.I've been listening to the other people talk.About the people they're leaving behind.How missed they'll be.And out of the other side of their mouths, why they don't miss them at all.And proving why they won't be missed.But who am I to judge?They call my name.It echoes in my mind.I didn't speak to anyone in the eternity I've been here, I never got the chance, there was no time.And yet they all know it's my turn.I can feel them judging me.Hear them whispering about me."Welcome to Hell," I mutter, as I take the few steps of the limitless expanse between the waiting area and the judgment hall.I cross the doorway dividing one unidentifiable nothing from another."Be seated," a voice whispers and booms.I sit on a concrete bench that wasn't there when I walked in.I look around.A formless, empty void coalesces into a bright, stuffy courtroom.A judge sits directly across from me, miles above me.Other people appear.Three of them.Adversarial to me, but on my same level.More for the judging."Welcome to your judgment.""It's all judgment.It's never been anything but judgment.""Yes.This is the last.Four judges.First, the individual to whom you were most cruel."A man steps forward.I see him clearly now.Me.Me from the last thing I remember before I showed up here in the Hell of purgatory."You know why I'm here," He/I say(s)."Yes," I say.Somehow, I know.Without him--me--saying a word, I know.How could I not know why it would be him?"But do you know why you're here?""To determine whether I go up or down?"I ask."No."The man shakes his head."That decision's already been made.""Then why do this?"The other me smiles and steps back.He is slowly replaced, as the judge above the other judges says, "the individual to whom you were kindest."Not another me.A child.Spiky blond hair.Invisible eyebrows.A hot rod t-shirt.Oh.Of course.Now I remember.Not just any child.It's been so long."You know why I'm here," the boy says."Yes," I say.I do know.Somehow I know which thing, in a long list of things, matters most to that boy."But do you know why you're here?"To determine whether I go up or down?"I ask."No."The boy shakes his head."That decision's already been made.""By whom?"The boy smiles and steps back.He is slowly replaced, as the judge above the other judges says, "the individual saved by your actions."A teenager.Dirty blond, or light brown hair, in an unfortunate bowl cut.Teeth too big for his mouth.Eyebrows dyed black, popping out from his sickly pale face.I recognize him.Of course I recognize him, it hasn't been that long.Not as long as the boy, anyway."You know why I'm here," the teen says."Yes," I say.It just comes to mind.I know what I did for that dying teen.I know how I saved him."But do you know why you're here?""To determine whether I go up or down?"I ask."No."The teen shakes his head."That decision's already been made.""On what basis?"The teen smiles and steps back.Nobody moves to replace him, but the judge says, "finally, the individual who died due to your choices.""Where?"I ask.The boy, the teen, and the man return to their positions and stand facing me, silently, still smiling; staring at me surface-level, deep down inside, and all the way through."You know where," the judge says, and the man, the teen, and boy, too.I see myself through their eyes.My own eyes begin to water.I drop to my knees.I begin mumbling incoherently as the floodgates open.They kneel and weep and mumble along with me, and then they stop and ask, "but do you know why you're here?"The friends fall out because neither can face that they each think the other thinks he's a failure.The mother is so quick to anger because she thinks her daughter thinks she's too strict, a disciplinarian.The daughter is so easily defensive because she thinks her mother thinks she's bad, a problem child.The coworkers hate each other because each sees the other as a dark mirror.His own worst qualities reflected, amplified, pushed back on him.If they looked inside, they'd have to see that what they hate about each other is what they think the other hates about them.So they blame the other.It's his fault.It's her fault.Not mine.Certainly not mine.It's because you judge me that I judge you.We're born.We're ripped out of the peaceful, empty nothingness, and thrust into Hell.We live in Hell.We finally die.When we die, we're sent to... Hell?Yes.Hell.Yes.I do now."The decision's already been made," I answer.They nod in unison."Where?"the judge asks."By whom?"the boy asks."On what basis?"the teen asks."And why do this?"the man asks.We blame other people to absolve ourselves.I address each in turn."Here," I say to the judge."Me," I tell the boy."You," I answer the teen."So I understand," I respond to the man.They look at me, and each other.They disappear into the room, and the room disappears into the void, and the void disappears, and I disappear.Hell is the looking-glass self.----
