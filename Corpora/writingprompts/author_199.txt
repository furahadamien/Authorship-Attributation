When I first regained my sight I saw the messages, "Don't tell them you can see".I wondered who "them" might be.I'll be honest, my first thought was space aliens of some sort of monsters from a Stygian realm.I was terrified.I carefully got out my cane and went about my business, often closing my eyes to make the subterfuge more believable.Then I saw my first glimpse of the truth.We were "them".The scant few that could see were chained or harnessed to work for the blind masses.Not down on the grubby streets where most of us eeked out our living, mind you.There was a military, or industrial wealth class that had quickly seized the few who had never gone blind.In the first days of The Great Blinding there had been a few helpful souls that had not succumbed according to the rumors.But the rumors faded when everyone realized the'd never met a sighted person or became unsure of their memories of those first few traumatic days.Over time it was revealed that a few people took longer to lose their sight.And so many people died in those first weeks that who was to say when someone simply disappeared.But now I could glance across distant vistas and through chain link fences at the sighted slaves doing the work only sighted people can do.Tethered and beaten, the slaves, some hobbled by broken or missing feet, could glare defiance, and leave messages that the blind overseers couldn't detect.The words were in mismatched paints or organic stains.The words were in the margins of the braille paperwork.The messages were passed by a one in a thousand moment of eye contact and a nodding head as you pass on the street.In the land of the blind the sighted man is not king.He is valuable property.But revolution is brewing.
