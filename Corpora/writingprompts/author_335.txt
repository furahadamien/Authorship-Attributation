I blinked.*What?* 

The cashier had tears in his eyes and was staring right into mine with such intensity I had to keep blinking."L.M.A.O.my dude," I offered nervously, not knowing what he had just heard me say."Are you feeling alright?"He didn't answer.In the moments that followed, silence took over the room as neither of us said or did anything.I had counted to 69 Mississippi's in my head when Jefe - that was his name, according to the name tag I noticed and read after Mississippi 42 - suddenly jumped over the register onto the customer side.Before I could react, he started running for the door."Hey, wait!"I yelled after him, but he did not listen.Jefe burst through the glass door and out into the street, seemingly unaffected by the flurry of broken glass and metal that his body had encountered.I turned back to the register and an older, Hispanic man in McDonald's kitchenware emerged from the kitchen."Hey," I started nervously, checking his apron for a name tag.It was on his lower left abdomen area, and it read Jeff."Jeff, I ordered two large fries and a fountain drink.""*Eey*!You speak fantastic Portuguese, my friend!"Jeff whispered, smiling."Your order is ready, I was just about to bring it out when I heard some noise."He turned and walked back towards the kitchen, but stopped abruptly in front of the doorway."Wait a second, how did you know I come from Portugal?"he said, his upbeat tone quickly fading."And where is the boy, Jefe?""Oh yeah, Jefe said something really weird and -" A loud screech and thud interrupted my sentence.I turned and dashed over to a window beside the destroyed entrance to see what caused the noise.An old, beat up looking Jeep was  stopped haphazardly across the middle of road.Its windshield was covered in blood and shattered through the upper right corner.My eyes scanned the parking lot and I gasped, quite audibly, when I saw what the Jeep had hit.Jefe's body lay a few yards in front of the Jeep, crumpled up like a bloody pretzel.I stood by the window dazed as Jeff ran out of the store screaming.*What the flippity fuck?* My mind was blank and seemed to be preparing to produce its first thoughts to react when a bright light made me blink and squint.The light was followed by a deafening bang and a shock wave that made me back up a few steps.Just like that, the Jeep had exploded.Bits of metal and rubber flew into the store through the shattered windows as what was just a few seconds ago a Jeep became a smoldering pile of metal.*What did Jefe mean by thousands of years?Why did this Jeep explode?Where did Jeff go?* These questions raced through my mind.I carefully climbed over the rubble surrounding the entrance and looked around.Suddenly, another blinding light made me look away.*Another explosion?!* I thought incredulously.I was right.Jefe had exploded.
