I Had never been one for reading, let alone about my own life which Id relived many times over, most of the memories not the greatest.It is an odd feeling to see my thoughts written there in vivid detail and my brain couldn't help but filter through the past to bring up old feelings and emotions I had done my best to bury deep down in a hole which I had no intention of falling down.I had only read a couple chapters in, skimming over parts, nodding along with the narrator, that being me, until pausing at a place that held my attention for far too long."Hey sir, you're doing a solid job here, thanks for all you do.take it easy" 

I had mentioned this to the janitor while passing him daily in the halls, merely a face in the endless stream throughout my day really never paying him any mind.I had read something, whether it had been an article, a friend's Instagram quote or whatever, about how some people just need to know others notice them.It was a fleeting thought that day and I carried about.The paragraphs quickly moved onto how I despised my next class, that being writing, where Id undoubtedly be lectured on the proper agreement between parts of speech and so on, but something kept my eyes back on that sentence.I glanced at the footnote to see where his book was and stood up so fast, my head started spinning.Not exactly what you want in a place full of priceless treasures such as these.I steadied myself and focused on the numbers and names etched into the spines of the books.Until I found him.My hands furiously grabbed the book and I sat back down, crossing my legs and opening to roughly the day and time of the sentence that had been linked to mine.I dawned my uniform and badge that day, as any other, to be walked on by the youth of today.Since leaving the military it was one of the few jobs I, as a former infantryman was qualified for.I'd been at this post for many years now, and my only drive being that of my sick wife.We had been smokers throughout the years and it was no surprise that one of us would come down with chronic emphysema.But I would have given anything for it to be me and not her.I couldn't bear the thought of living a day without the love of my life, even if it meant working this dead-end job, and cleaning up the gum encrusted underbellies of tables and chairs for the rest of our days.Today had started out particularly bad, waking up to the sound of coughing and hacking of Jane in the bathroom again.I strolled in to see her hovering over the sink with the cannula in her nose and oxygen tank by her feet, spitting a vile green paste of a substance into the sink.I helped her back to bed before heading off to work.The President of the school hadn't paid me any notice before tossing a coffee cup in the general direction of the garbage and missing...spilling its contents all over the tile floor.I grabbed the mop and started work quickly, hoping to be done before the students got out.But I was too late, here they came to walk their disgusting feet through my work and stain the floor even further.I stood back against the wall hoping to blend into the background when this young kid, paused near the coffee cup, and bent over tossing it in the trash can.Black hair, and piercing green eyes, but kindness hidden behind them, none that had ever been shown to me at this school since my hiring and uttered a single sentence that Ive never forgotten."Hey sir, you're doing a solid job here, thanks for all you do.take it easy He turned and waved and my day seemed a bit brighter, a little less bleak.I cleaned the mess up and returned to my car for lunch, but frowned as I climbed into the front seat and looked in the duffle bag down at my feet which I had carefully placed my .45 and AR.It hadn't been much he said and I don't know why it held such an impact, but tears flowed from my eyes as I slammed my fists into the console.Angry at myself for ever thinking that was a good idea for enacting my revenge on this place.What would her life be without me to take care of her, or my son and daughter to watch me go to prison or worse, killed after doing the unthinkable.I owe my life to that kid and swore from that day forward that no matter how bad my day is, I would always say hi to the people in the hallways and try to pass on that feeling that he had given me.Somewhere in an alternate universe perhaps, a different me, a dumber, less thankful me, is carrying out that deed with malice in.But it's not me, at least not today.
