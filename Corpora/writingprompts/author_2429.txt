Look here, I'm just doing my job.Sure, you might think I'm some kind of jerk but when you think about it, the world needs a counter to the plethera of oh so dandy heroes out there.Every since I was a youngin, I wanted to be a hero like the very few that started the business.Oh, you didn't know?People are so caught up with this super hero ideaology that damn near anyone can get themselves a gig nowadays, whether it be stopping a butter knife wielding, cracked out mugger or the latest of alien life forms trying to dominate our species.Honestly, it's getting too oversaturated and sickening to watch.I was given a very specific and hard to screw up set of rules... "You see a good guy that you know you can kill?You kill him" is what I was taught since the day I lost (and regained at the same time) hope.I don't go chasing the top tier heroes because, let's be honest, I'd get my ass handed to me by a barrage of whatever omnipotent force you believe in.Is it a "sunshine and rainbows" kind of job?Hell no.Does it keep things somewhat balanced?Eh, depends on the tier of the kill list I'm given for that week.It used to be so simple, look at the list and kill a hero.First I started out with Batman because, let's be real, he was an awful "hero".Once I managed to effortlessly slink behind him while he was monologuing with whoever the hell "The Joker" was, all it took was a gunshot to the back of the head.Things got a bit overinflated on behalf of my ego though.I thought to myself "Well damn, if that sucker was so easy then why not go for king shit on turd mountain?", who at the time, was Superman.Let me tell you, he is no joke, even with a few bullets encased in kryptonite.This is where things got real weird and real dark, real fast.I couldn't beat him.Even though I fired kryptonite at him he could just get out of the way of the bullet it was in, just enough to where the radiation from it would barely tickle him.After years I drew the last straw and went to what I knew best.Was it my proudest moment, crawling back to dear ole daddy, asking for his help?Absolutely not.Was it worth it?Depends on who you ask.You see, the thing is that I have an abnormally strange ability.Some would say, in the same manner as someone calling out a spoiled trust fund baby, that I was handed this "gift".You'd be surprised at how much of a dick my dad is when it comes to giving people power over others, especially when it came to being the absolute best.You see, my dearest ole daddy is a fella that those in the mortal realm call "Satan" or "Lucifer".Me?I call him a dick, a cunt, a bastardizing douche.Sure, kids have issues with their parents but mine was a tad more complicated.Once I was born to a mortal woman, she immediately had me baptised through the Catholic church, in order to hopefully wipe away the sins of those far before me.After nearly dying to Superman, however, I made a call to dad by simply cutting open my girlfriend's throat (the dumbass saved herself for marriage).The deal was not an easy sell but dearest ole dickhead dad agreed to cosign on my loan.Weird, right?The thing is, when you make a bargain like mine and prepare it as such an amazing business offer as I did, you're forced to talk to the CEO of *everything*.Good ole grandpappy himself, the head honcho of all that is and will ever live, G-O-D.I had to sell my pitch of trading my soul for divine power on both ends of the spectrum, being the command of heaven *and* hell, along with all of the might belonging to the two.Let me tell you, it took me creating (only my uncle knows) wars, plagues, human faults, etc.but I did it.I was given the keys to the weapons vault of both heaven and hell and, after doing some tinkering, managed to infuse the best of both worlds into my however many fingers humans have.Nowadays I just wait for an angel or demon to spring up and let me know when a hero is too good and get to work.It's pretty simple once you have the power of both ends of the spectrum in terms of life's greatest powers at you fingertips, just point, choose where they're going, and focus.I usually send them to hell so I can let dad have some fun still but a few of the noble ones actually get to meet grandpappy and my uncle J and hang with them for a while.Is it tough?Absolutely not.The moment I walk up to one of those assholes they know what their fate is and *usually* (Superman was pompous enough to require *eight* suns being condensed *into* him to kill him) accept a swift death.But hey, I asked for it and I received it.
