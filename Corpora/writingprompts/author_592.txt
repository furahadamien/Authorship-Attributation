"Damn it all!Damn it!"I yelled at my pitch black sorroundings.My white hair fell in front of my face as I kept screaming."Why the hell would he do this?!Why?!"I struck that interior metal wall, denting it.I then began to shed tears."This morning," I sobbed slightly, eyes closed, still trying to forget the events of today, "The past months, no years, I had a life.I had a loyal lover.I had children.Even grand children.Then great grand children."I opened my eyes and moved my newly unwavering gaze from the nearly invisible far wall, to my hands; my scarless, plain, and muscular hands.I clenched them into fists."And no one told me who I really was.No one wanted  wanted him back.They wanted a nobody.They wanted me to fade away."I looked back at the wall, trying to use my powers again, to no avail.Only thing I could see was a slight shake of the wall, and at that I closed my eyes again and tried to calm down.*She wouldn't want me to damage anything*, I thought to myself.I smiled at that thought.*She was the only one to care.She was the one person in the world who knew my pain.I can't wait to see her again.*

I tried to remeber the good morning I had.The coffee alone.The phone call with my "family.* And then I tried to remember the single letter I recieved that day.It was a simple note, and a small article from that mornings newspaper, that I never recieved before.The note read, *I miss you, come back-with Love S.* At first I thought it was simply a case of the mailman giving me the wrong mail, but then I read the news."Today marks the 50th anniversary of the successful operation the regime took to end the tyranny of the False Emperor.The man known to have nearly conquered the world with an army of enslaved soldiers, bent on making us all bend to his will.May he never return to ravage our glorious Empire!Long Live the True Emperor of Sol!The hero who beat the Immortal Emperor singlehandedly!"At the top of the small page, lies a picture of a toppled statue.A toppled statue of myself, as I looked today, with a single man stood atop it.*What he did to me was worse than death.He not only took my life from me, but he kept me as a man enslaved to his empire, when it should've been MINE.*

This time the metal room around me did begin to shake and crack.I knew what was happening."My power is back."It was at this point I got out of my seat and went toward the left wall, and pulled back a horizontal plastic bit, revealing the crimson stained glass.Beyond it, lied the ruins of North America.I watched crumbling buildings come and go.I watched bird and beast roam through the streets.I watched everything from up high.Suddently I heard a the pop of a microphone, "My Lord, we will be arriving to HQ in 60 seconds please keep seated for the landing," a firm female voice said.I didn't acknowledge her.I only nodded and returned to my seat, my basic white and gold robe hovering just above the floor as I moved.It was now, I noticed the thrum of the engines and the shifting moments of the helicopter.I remained silent and peaceful until we landed.The doors flew open to the sight of dozens of black camouflaged soldiers guarding the helepad with a single red-robed black-haired woman who had purple eyes, and a face so beautiful it could charm any man.As soon as I walked out, the breeze picked up, causing my robe to nearly fly off, and Other black-camouflaged helecopters began to arrive to what now seemed to be an old ocean-bound fossil fuel refinery.As I arrived closer to my greeting party I noticed more and more soldiers began to pour out of all sorts of hatched and door, preparing for who-knows-what.They moved barrels and netted boxes around.Pulled up ancient devices from the depths of the platform, and moved in such a way that it looked like a choreographed dance.The woman in front of me noticed my curiosity and smiled."They are a well oiled machine, and will be ready for whatever is to come, Korian.""Korian," I stated out loud, "That's my name.""Yes it is, and it is a name long forgotten to those that once feared it.""I think it's a good time for them to remember," I stated smirking."Then shall we get started, my love?""Yes, my Soria, we shall."I am home.
