*BEEP BEEP*

I rocketed upright in my bed as I woke with a start.I glanced at my clock, *3:00 AM* it read.Grogily, I yawned and picked up the source of this rude awakening, my phone.As I pressed the power button, bringing the device to life, I noticed something strange.*An emergency alert?* I thought.I unlocked it and tapped the notification.The screen presented to me contained seven words: **Warning: Do not look at the moon!"**

Before I had a chance to question the strange alert, the phone in my hand began buzzing louder than a chourus of bees as text after text flashed rapidly before my eyes, each displaying the exact same message, "It's beautiful tonight.Look outside.""Huh," I said, "What a dumb prank."I laid my phone back on the nightstand and lay back down in my bed, drifting off to sleep.The morning sunlight peeked through the curtains when I woke up, shining a thin line of light on the opposite wall.I got up, opened the curtains, and immediately vomited at the sight.Hundreds of decaying corpses, strewn across the ground outside, every one of them with a phone in hand, their bodies decomposing in the hot summer sun.As I stared in horror at the view ouside my window, I heard a faint buzz.Hesitantly, I reached out and opened my phone to reveal that I had one new text message.I clicked open the message."They looked at the moon."
