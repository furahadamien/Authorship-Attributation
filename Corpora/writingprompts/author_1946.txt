Vampiric-Argonian
"You're safe now"

I shot him point-blank, scattering his brains into the darkness of the alley behind him.I stared coldly at the look of shock on his corpse and it collapsed first to it's knees and then toppled lifelessly onto its side, revealing the cavern that had been blown open on the back of the head.Hurriedly I pocketed the firearm and kneeled next to the screeching form on the ground, the disguise of a wallet slipping off it as it continued to writhe in pain.I coo'd softly and gently scooped it up.The facade of leather faded quickly, the flaps at either side revealing themselves as bat like wings, the middle shifting into a hideous face that cried and cried."It's okay" I murmured, "I'm sorry, I didn't know he was one of those holier-than-thou jackasses from the academy.It won't happen again, don't worry, we'll get you all fixed up, Ms Jacky'll get you sorted.We'll get you all healed up and then we'll get you back to home where the academy will never bother you again."The cries slipped to uncertain hiccups and then to silence as I spoke, a pair of shiny black eyes, wet from tears, gazed at me as I spoke.I lifted it slowly and pointed to a star, bringing the sad creature directly under my eye so it could follow my finger."Right up there, we'll send you back and your family will be waiting for you and they'll be so happy to see you."I kissed it on the forehead, "And you'll go back to a normal life."It looked at me for a moment longer before chirping happily.It flapped it's wings once, twice, and was suddenly a wallet again.I held it loosely in one hand and rested that hand on my shoulder, talking now as I walked."Why, I bet we've already gotten another message from them, they've been transmitting nonstop about how happy they are to hear you're alright."I said, continuing on and on as me and my wallet made our way into the silent night, even as the faint hum of police sirens began to whine behind us.
