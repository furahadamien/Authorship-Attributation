"Finished".I whisper, rubbing my eyes and getting to my feet.Each cracking of my bones and twang in my muscles an hour, a month, a year .Years of nights not slept and days forgotten have brought me to this moment and I am ready to celebrate.It is only fitting that I be the first, perhaps the only?I bring the vial to my lips and let the metallic liquid flow over my tongue.I expect it to taste sweeter.To fill me with vitality, with strength, with life.As I choke the last of the sample down, I feel nothing.No change.It is only then that I see him.As smooth and sly as he looked all those years ago.He is ageless, charming, and defined.A jet black line in the darkness, his white bow tie and shoes assaulting the ink of his suit.He appears the same as the day he made his offer.Leaning against a wall, legs crossed, emitting a cocky attitude.I reach for my glasses and notice something has changed...The once sly smile that seemed to never waver has become a stone line.His head is shaking ever so subtly as he looks homeward."I've won" I muster."That's why you are here isn't it?I've beaten you!".My confidence is growing.My heart racing my mouth, both trying to stop the other.His gaze falls upon me, his eyes seem almost sympathetic."It appears you have..." He says, unblinking as he turns towards the door."What's this?!No response!?!No clever retort!?!"I scream."You will never have me.I have all the time in the world!"At this he pauses.Without turning, he says " isn't it funny, that taste... You expect it to be sweeter" 

" What do you mean?"My voice decides to reply."The elixir... You are not it's first to embrace.Have you never wondered what I truly am?What things I have seen to make me this way?Those I have lost?Have loved?Have yearned to reknow?"He turns to face me once more."The gift you have given yourself can never be returned.Try as you might, you will fall victim to it's wonder.You will never age from this point but neither too will your memories.You will watch as the last shred of light is ripped from the universe and experience first hand the brilliant shine of a new universe forming.Those who wish to know you will cast you off as a demon.Those you wish to know will never understand.Never aging, all knowing, immortal"

He turns again to the door and walks slowly away.I can faintly hear his bones cracking with each step.Edit: vial and final sentence structure
