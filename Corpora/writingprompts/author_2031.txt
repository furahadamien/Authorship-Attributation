The Ferryman led the child by the hand to a great river, and instructed the child to gather a big pile of stones by doing so, silently, and pointing.When the child asked why, the Ferryman said nothing and walked over to his boat.The child stacked a big pile of stones, which fell over.The Ferryman shook his head at the child, and motioned for a pile as tall as the one he demonstrated.After several attempts, the child finally managed to stack a pile almost as big as the Ferryman's, just one stone away from being just as tall, but when they went to stack the final stone, the child slipped and knocked the entire pile down with their stone.The child started to cry, not knowing why they had to do this, but then a comforting hand was placed on their shoulder, the Ferryman's own hand.The Ferryman gestured to the fallen rocks, which spelt out a message:

"If there were two guys on the moon and one of them killed the other with a rock would that be fucked up or what?"
