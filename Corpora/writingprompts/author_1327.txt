[I'd like to preface this story with a trigger warning.I've never used one before but I'm sure it's necessary for this one.When I read the prompt, I wanted to put a different spin on it, it's a tragic sort of love story, the way it usually is in life, so towards the end I delve into a darker place than was probably intended by the person who created the prompt.I don't mean to offend anyone and hope that you enjoy the story despite the direction it goes in.]My legs felt numb.I had been walking for an hour straight now and I wasn't even halfway back to my job.It probably would've been faster to head to Nate's and have him give me a ride back but the thought of having to make up an excuse for my complicated situation, yet again, exhausted me.I was emotionally drained, just like every other time and it only seemed to be getting more frequent.It was getting to the point where I couldn't even go a few days without having to be in this situation yet again.I didn't have any idea how far I had walked.You would think after ten years of this, I would've gotten used to it.Not.In High School, I had been some lanky kid desperate for any girl to give me a chance.Sitting down, I thought back to those days, when I had scoured the internet for tips and tricks to get the girl.A humorless smile formed on my lips as  I pictured my younger self sitting in his room performing a prayer ritual to Aphrodite, the Goddess of love.I had promised to be by the side of any girl that gave me the time of day whenever she was in need forever and always.Had I known what was to come, I would've never committed to a lifetime of this.The smile slowly disappeared from my face at that thought.Amber came into my life that very next day.She was radiant.There was a light in her that I had never seen in anyone else.When she spoke to me the very first time I thought I was surely dreaming.Her wide, light brown eyes were full of mischief.Her thick golden brown curls gleamed brightly in the sunlight.Her personality was brilliant and fierce and gentle and passionate.I had never seen the world, not really, until I met her.The thing about being a kid, is that everything that you feel is more intense than it will ever be at any other point in your life.She was a destructive storm and I was a storm chaser that was swept away by the force of her.It wasn't long before I fell head over heels for her and finally built up the courage to ask her to be my girlfriend.In my fifteen years of life, I had never felt as happy as I felt during that time that we spent together but I would be insane to say that I hadn't noticed the sadness that lay behind it all.With that passion and whirlwind of emotions, came an endless well of darkness that was slowly extinguishing the light that I had come to know.Only months later she had asked me to a park where we had met many times.It was there that she had explained that she couldn't keep it up anymore.The entire time she had refused to look me in the eye as she confessed that she had cheated on me.That day I learned that with every immense high there is a seemingly endless low.We stopped talking for a while.It hadn't been hard to avoid her since we hardly had any classes together, at first anyway.I could only keep that up for so long though.I felt myself drawn to her despite the burning anger and pain that being by her side brought me.After some time the hurt of her betrayal faded but she was spiraling and that caused a different hurt altogether.I did everything in my power to comfort her.I wanted to.Doing that fulfilled something inside of me that I hadn't even realized forming.It morphed and changed within me until it was an instinct.Borderline obsession even.It wasn't until years later when I would link my incessant need to be at her side every time she needed someone to the night that I had begged Aphrodite for a chance at the love I had always craved.Eventually, heading to her house on impulse became dropping everything in a moments notice at her call.That evolved into racing to her side no matter how far she was from me.The stranger things started only a year or two ago.The first time it happened, I was sure that I had completely lost my ever loving mind.I had been in the middle of helping a friend move and in the time it took me to blink, I was in Amber's one bedroom apartment.A vibrating in my chest pulled me from the memories of everything that had happened in the past ten years.It was soft at first, barely there.It always was but then it grew into an increasingly louder hum.I closed my eyes, the familiar feeling of weightlessness taking over me.I didn't dare look, it had yielded unsavory results the one time I had tried.The process took an instant but it felt like it lasted at least five minutes.The familiar smell of lavender filled my nostrils signalling that I had been transported back into Amber's apartment.I was standing in her bedroom this time.It was a mess like it had been when I had been here earlier that day.There were stains on the carpet that were probably months old, some were maybe even years old.My instincts led me into the small bathroom that was connected to the bedroom.The door was ajar and the light was on indicating that Amber was in there.When I entered, my eyes found Amber's small form curled up between the sink and the bathtub.Her eyes were closed and the only sound in the room besides my shoes crunching the broken glass on the floor, was her ragged breathe coming in soft wisps.There were pill bottles lying all over the floor empty.I moved slowly over to where she was and slid to the ground, leaning back against the wall across from her.She stirred and her eyes fluttered open.Her thick eyelashes framed her almond-shaped eyes in a way that I had always admired but there were dark circles under them from nights that she had spent battling her inner demons while I held her."Jake.." Her full lips formed a weak smile.I didn't speak, just stared at her.I was afraid that if I did, I would lose the last shred of sanity I had left for tonight.In this moment, I felt older than I was.At twenty-five I should be thinking about the family that I would be starting but this broken girl in front of me had consumed my every waking moment for a decade now.There had been times when I had hated her for it but had known deep down that I could never truly hate her.Some small part of me would always love her.It was the depression she had struggled with all her life that  I truly hated.Despite my advice and offers, she had decided repress it with drugs and sex than with actual medical help.She had in a way sealed our fates.Her arms trembled as she tried to prop herself up which is when I noticed the open wounds on her wrists.I slid my way across the floor so that I was closer to where she was now."I'm so sorry, Jake.I just can't do it anymore."She sounded tired.The light in her eyes had dimmed to almost nothing now as she searched mine for something."I know, Amber.I love you."I said back softly.She seemed satisfied and leaned back, closing her eyes once more.Her breathing continued to slow as time wore on.For the first time in a long time, I felt a calmness sweep through me unlike any I had ever felt before.I almost didn't recognize it when it happened.Amber had lost a lot of blood today and even though I was no doctor, I knew that the lack of blood mixed with all of the pills she was sure to have downed just before I got here were going to be too much this time.It was almost as if I could feel it within myself.I don't know how long it took for her breathing to stop but the instant it did, I could feel my heart start to slow.It didn't hurt like I thought it would but the prospect of what came after was still mildly terrifying, especially with how long it was taking.As my chest clenched with the finality of my last handful of breaths, my eyes landed on her.She would be the last thing I saw and even though I had never really believed in anything after death, I knew that wherever she went I was going to follow.Even now, pale and fragile, she was as beautiful as she had ever been and I knew that my last words to her had been absolutely true.
