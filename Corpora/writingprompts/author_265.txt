When the aliens arrived, humanity was helpless to stop them.They killed as they pleased, taking out entire countries and even continents.Within weeks the population of Earth was down to 1,000.And they were the most powerful 1,000 people who ever lived, armed with the mana that was now concentrated within them.After that, the aliens left.But they left behind a single, strange device.One that they told the survivors would allow whoever held it to multiply their magical strength many, many times higher than it already was.Naturally, everyone wanted to become a god.Minutes after the alien's announcement and departure, hell broke loose.Landscapes were reshaped and destroyed by the battles that occurred around the planet.By the time the sun set, the remaining 483 humans stood in a barren wasteland.The device that started this free-for-all war was located at the North Pole in an incredibly sturdy container, deep in the ice.It took only seconds for the woman who found it to melt the frozen sea and raise it to the surface.But before she could open its alien metallic prison, she was sent flying into space by another human's spell.The worst battle in all of known history was fought that day.As more people died, the fight became fiercer and fiercer.When the number of spellcasters reached 205, a fire spell melted the ice caps.At 167, a tsunami washed away the mountains and rocks.At 104, a plague was created, taking the number down to 45.Then the world split in two.Magma was pulled up and put a swift end to most of the remaining combatants.And then there were three.One was compacted into a tiny cube with a single thought.Another dies after their heart was magically ripped out.And the last one vaporized in the mana-created heat they could not control.After their powerful enemies defeated themselves fighting over a useless metal brick, the aliens returned, bringing with them a human they had brought aboard their ship years ago.This human was the purest, most kind-hearted to ever exist.She now had near infinite power.And after saying goodbye to her home planet, which was now unrecognizable, she brought peace and order to the universe, Her universe.This is my first time writing on this subreddit, and I don't think its particularly good.Any feedback you have would be greatly appreciated.
