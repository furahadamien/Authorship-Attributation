Steven stammered and was at a loss for words for the first time since he learned to speak.He tried again, then, with words still failing him, shrugged hopelessly.Steven was exhausted and wilted.He had been vainly attempting to defend himself to St. Peter's court for nearly an hour.They had started peppering him with questions, starting with his first conscious decision to smack the fly that landed on his crib.And they had continued right through to today, when he sold his 'quirky' Bluray player through Craigslist to an unsuspecting buyer.Steven wasn't really a bad guy, but, more to the increasingly obvious and stressed point, he wasn't a good guy either.The amount of little things he'd done to benefit himself at someone else's expense vastly and horrifically outnumbered the amount of times he'd put someone else first.Questions finished, Steven was subjected to a stern lecture on morality and kindness, and then was dealt his judgement.It was done; Steven was going to Hell.Then, with the whisper of a barely audible angelic tone, the court was gone.A lone angel beckoned Steven turn around, then ushered into what could best be described as a celestial elevator.Steven looked outward at the white and ivory landscape, somehow both entirely endless and closely comforting, then back at the lone angel.Steven had just barely thought to perceive a smirk on the angel's face when suddenly he was descending.Steven's stomach lurched into his throat.His balance disappeared.Everything around him was in terrifyingly fast motion.Despite his best efforts, his body began rotating, slowly, until now he was shooting headfirst downward at an alarming rate.He began to spin, like a football with a perfect spiral.He perceived nothing except the change in atmosphere.White gave way to steel grey, then deep blacks.Oppressive humidity and pressure.Breathing became difficult.A terrible undefinable odour crept in.Then it all stopped.Suffering vertigo, dizziness, and blurry vision, Steven's knees gave out beneath him.He dropped to the ground and retched.Hard.Once, twice, three times.He insides felt shredded.His head pounded.Steven collapsed completely to the ground, his breath ragged, and passed out.Not knowing how much later, Steven awoke.His vision clearing, Steven managed to stand up and take stock.He was in a tiny room, dark and cylindrical.The ceiling was inches above his head, the walls close enough he couldn't stretch both arms out at once.He turned, and there was a door, framed in red, at the end of a narrow corridor.As he took a moment to consider staying on this side of it, he unexpectedly found that his back was against the wall, literally.Now the wall was pushing him, quite insistently, toward the red door.Steven conceded to go through the door, and the wall gave him some space.Reaching the door, Steven grabbed the red door knob, feeling it hot and smooth in his hand.He took a deep breath, gripped the knob tighter, then mustered all his courage to turn it, then open the door.Steven looked out into Hell.He seemed to be standing next to a bar.The dcor was all black and dark grey, but a bunch of people were sitting at it, talking and laughing like it was Friday night after work.Steven did a double-take, then looked behind him.The door was closed, and had a sign on it that said "Toilets".Steven looked back at the bar.The bartender appeared to be demonic, but was chained to the back wall - it appeared to only be allowed enough reach to cover the bar.Movement caught Steven's attention.A couple of guys and a girl were charging their way toward him, enthusiastic and cheering.They surrounded him, clapping him on the back, heartily welcoming, but in that fake way that sleazy car salesmen were.Now they hustled him back toward the bar, asking him his favorite drink and beckoning to the barkeep.Steven sat down, he sipped an ice cold gin and tonic placed there, and looked expectantly at each one in turn.Rubbing his hands, the most effervescent of the bunch introduced himself as Bob, and told Steven that he was about to hear the story of the time that people rebelled, then took over Hell.
