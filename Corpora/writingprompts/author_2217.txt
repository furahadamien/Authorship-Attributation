At 13, I discovered I had the ability to slow the flow of time.It feels like holding back an invisible river, standing as a damn against the mightiest current nature could devise, yet somehow I alone could block it's flow.At first I could only make a clock tick slightly slower, but as I practiced I found I could stop animals from moving, and eventually even stopped a flock of ducks taking off from a pond in midair.I can still picture that day... their wings moving almost imperceptibly, water droplets hanging suspended in the air...I wasn't exactly unique, mutants had been around for a decade now, and in my school alone we had a girl whose eyes glowed purple and could see anything anywhere, and a guy who could reshape concrete with his mind.They were both older than I was and a black jet took them somewhere.I didn't want to leave so I had kept my power to myself, taking care to avoid notice anytime I used it.By junior year of high school I could stop my entire school in its tracks, which I used to play pranks.Nothing super harmful, changing all the answers on our arrogant valedictorians answer sheet, switching the contents of two people's lockers while they had them open, all in good fun.However, the rest of the world started noticing when their kids started showing up 15-20min late home after school, and the school's clocks were continually off.During that same year some unnamed men in black showed up investigating the odd occurrences, and after that I gave up my powers for a while.Life happened, and one day as a wage slave at a local Wendy's I'd had enough of my manager and owner, and living in a dingy apartment, and I'm not proud of this, but I used my power to swipe all the cash and key their cars.A few miliseconds of real time, and about 30 minutes and I'd made more than working there for years.Instant addiction.I quickly moved onto banks and very rapidly had amassed a huge pile of wealth.Soon, whatever I wanted was mine.That nice new rolex on your wrist?You're just holding it for me, the world was basically my oyster, and I opened up a clock repair shop as a front for cleaning my cash.I was bored, so, so bored.Life had become far too easy, and by 21 I had more than I could ever want.That all changed one day driving my souped up SRT Hellcat, weaving through traffic slowing time and speeding it up to clear a path.I saw a motorcyclist blow a tire and begin to go down.Without thinking, instantly I froze the city, opened my door and stepped out, faltering slightly as I skid a bit on the pavement, time not being totally stopped because I was freezing such a large area.I jogged up to him, and lifted him off his bike, carrying him back to my car and setting him in the passenger seat.Experience taught me he would still be moving when I unfroze him, so just setting him at the side of the road would have caused him to skid along the ground.I closed the door, unfroze time and drove down to road to let a very confused but thankful man out.It felt good to be a hero, to save his life.When I got home all the news could talk about was the missing 2 minutes of time that all the clocks had experienced.The 2 minutes the city lost as the rest of the world sped by.It was concluded that a powerful mutant had frozen time, and the motorcyclist's story was soon heard by all.Sadly, saving one man's life doesn't negate stealing 10's of millions of dollars, and the banks were pretty quick to put 2 and 2 together.I was never publicly identified, but it wasn't very long before some intrepid heroes figured out who I was.It did take quite a while though, and in the meantime I was out and about, mostly listening to police scanners and showing up in the background.As long as I was around, no bullet could move faster than a snail's crawl, a speeding car was suddenly easy to catch, and running away was just not an option.My peak was stopping a bomb mid-explosion when the bomb squad failed to diffuse it correctly, saving the two bomb techs.That one took some work.I just say I'm freezing time, but the fact is it still moves.Getting that shockwave to completely halt and dragging those 2 to safety took everything I had, and walking back to my car my head was on fire.That's when it happened.I felt myself being lifted off my feet, and the rest of the world was a blur, instinctively I reached out and slowed down time to find out I was being carried by a man who was running down the street.He was dressed in an all white suit that looked like it was made of something weird.He had a pair of lightning bolts running down either side of his chest, honestly it's just easier to say he looked like an 80's rock band reject.Looking around, everyone was frozen, and I was sure he should be too.Deciding enough was enough, I elbowed him in the face and rolled off his shoulder to the ground.I skid slightly on the ground letting me know we had been moving at great speed.Standing slowly I brushed off my suit, the mystery man very clearly putting on the breaks, was leaned at a near 45 degree angle pumping his legs so fast that the light blurred around them, his eyes were a perfect O of surprise as he clutched his nose, blood slowly dripping.I took my time, glanced over myself noting some scuffs."This is a custom fit hand tailored $5000 suit, I'll be sure to bill you for it, whoever you are."I said, not expecting a response.He looked confused, and his lips blurred as he responded, "Hah, villain!You've stolen far more than enough to pay for it's repair!And I'm here to end your unchecked diabolical thefts against the citizens of this city!"Internally I groaned, what a dweeb!Did he actually say that?But there was a serious look on his face and his pumping legs were moving him towards me, admittedly at about walking speed, which was comical given that he looked like he was at an all out sprint, but this was rather serious.I'd never met anyone who could actually move when I didn't want them too.Suddenly in almost a second he'd crossed the space between us and landed 3 blows!I concentrated harder and he slowed back to normal speed, I planted my foot square in his nuts, and once again picked myself up.Now I was pissed, between the headache, and being carried then dumped, and hit...I was doing the right thing for the first time in my life!Why was I being punished for it!"What the hell man, what did I ever do to you?"I cried out."You've stolen from the fair citizens of this city!And I'm here to stop you!"He replied, superior look on his face."I literally just saved the bomb squad!I've been saving people for months now, I'm one of the good guys, I could help you!""LIAR!Once a bad guy always a bad guy!"Came his retort.Really?People really talk like that?Was all I could think.The guy was a tool, but I didn't want to hurt him.I squared up focusing all my ability onto him, the rest of the world slowly speeding up as he slowed down until everyone was moving normally and he was frozen in place.I blended into the crowd as people gathered around, gasping.Panicked cries of people questioning how "The Blur" was frozen followed me.I managed to keep it up for about 3 blocks until I lost my hold on him.Somehow he didn't catch up to me and I made it home with an Uber, stopping for a few ibuprofen on the way home.When I got there it was all over the news.The Blur was talking about how a new super villain ran away when confronted by his 'super self', and how the 'coward' had better never show up again.I sat back, slowly, contemplating my new enemy.So, super villain was I?I grinned, feeling the pain in my lip from where it'd been busted earlier.At least life isn't boring anymore...
