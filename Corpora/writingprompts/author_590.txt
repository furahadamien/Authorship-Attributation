I was sweating.Beads of perspiration trickled down my brow and I wiped at them absent-mindedly.My hands shook as I read the newspaper clipping.My eyes blurred as confused tears appeared.'Violent And Erratic Weather Patterns Cease' the headline read.But that headline had been enough.I closed my eyes, and the the tears came.That had been me.I had called myself the Weatherman back then.I could control the weather.I could cause tornados, storms, lightning.I could give myself a cushion of air to stand on and effectively fly.I had terrorised the city.For the briefest of six days, I had acted publicly.Unable to hide my powers from society any longer, I had decided to come out of the shadows and present myself to the city.And promised to rule.Six days.And then she came.And all was gone.There was a knock on the door.I hastily crumple the clippings and other artifacts that hinted of my past and stuffed them in a briefcase, and slid that briefcase inside my cupboard.And, wiping away sweat and tears from my face, I answered the door."Hello, James.You look like you've been up all night."my therapist said, letting herself in.Right.Session sixteen of the prescribed twenty-two sessions.I stared at her for a moment, wondering if I should tell her the truth.I had been seeing her on and off for about ten years, but she was still a therapist, no matter how cheap her sessions were.Truth was I had been up all night.Digging deep into the past.Looking for the incident that gave me my amnesia.The amnesia which also made me forget I had powers.The newspaper clipping, and the vambrace I wore back then as a part of my ridiculous costume, now broken, lay in the briefcase.They were hard evidence of the Weatherman.Of me.The clipping was published on the November 12, 2007.A decade ago.It had been a decade since I was the Weatherman."James?"the therapist called from my kitchen.She had a habit of making coffee for our sessions."Yeah.No sugar this time."I called back, shutting the door softly and taking my seat."I asked you if you were up all night."she said.Damned therapists."Yeah.I was looking at books and hobbyist magazines and such.Trying to remember what I liked to do."I replied.She did not say anything right away, and all I could hear was her pouring coffee into a mug."And?"she asked finally, bringing the mugs into the living room."So far, nada."I lied.She looked at me for a second.Then said, "Your memory is slowly coming back.That's good.But you shouldn't rush these things.Maybe stop thinking of what ifs and start thinking about facts.What you liked doing in the past, what you wanted to do, thinking about those things right now are just wild shots in the dark.You need to focus on what you know.What you're good at.Focus on the now and on the future, James."I sighed.She was right.I shouldn't focus on the what ifs.I should go on with my life until I knew facts.But I knew facts now.I knew what liked to do.I knew I was the Weatherman."After the incident.After you were discharged and everything was hazy and finding a job was difficult.What did you do?You went through your personal belongings.Went through your home, and found your degree in accounting.And then you realised you liked numbers.And what do you know?You found a job in a school office.And what happened there?"she prodded."I automatically got into my old accounting habits.How I sit in the chair.How I twirl my pen.How I organise my stationery.And a few months into the job I started getting my memory back.At least memories of my old job at the bank."I replied."Exactly.Stick to your guns, let your memories come to you at their own time.Stop grasping at shadows."she said.I wasn't grasping at shadows, though.The memories had come.They were real.I stared at my hand, at the mug, and willed a breeze.And almost gasped when I felt cool air gather and gently push at my hand.The tendrils of swirling steam changed direction and followed my breeze.I was the Weatherman.I looked back at the therapist.She who told me not to dwell on my past and start looking at the future.To try and build from what I knew."You."I said in a low voice."What?"She asked, he brows creased."I was the Weatherman.And you."I growled.The memory came back.Six days I was ruling my city.And then she came.My hands clenched.My fingernails dug into my palms.The window burst open and a gale blew in.Loose paper started flying.The wind carried me off my seat.Her.That day.Day six.She took everything from me.My city.My power.My memories.And then.And then she sat before me.Telling me to stop prying into my past.The past that she hid from me.From the minds of everyone who knew.Telling me to move on.Telling me to focus on the now and the future.Telling me to become a better man then I was in the past."James.Please."she looked at me, her eyes pleading.I stopped my control, and the wind violently ripped apart and dissipated, throwing me across the room headfirst into the wall.When I came to, she stood over me with concerned eyes.Her mouth moving but her voice distant.She pulled me to my feet."Why?"I heard myself ask.She pursed her lips, and helped me to the couch."Why?"I asked again, my voice stronger, my senses returning."Why what?""Why everything?You took away my memory, my power.And then for a decade you've been helping me recover and get my life back together.Why?"I asked."That's...I don't know how to answer that right now."she said."Why?""Look.I think you're concussed.I'm going to drive you to a hospital but you have to promise me you're not going to try anything."she said, ignoring me."I'm not promising shit till you tell me who the fuck you are and what games you're playing with my life."I shot back.For a second it looked as if my words had hurt her.But then she steeled her gaze."Yours isn't the only life I've been playing with."she said softly.I stared, mind racing."I knew one of you would eventually figure it out.I'm lucky it even took this long.Wiping not only your memories, but everyone who's been involved, who's been in the loop.That's hard to do.Hardest of all was you.That's why I stopped bothering with anyone who went public with their abilities."You were the Weatherman.But there were more villains after you.You just happened to be my first.There was the Jailbreaker, Pyromancer, Great Giggle, Mannequin, Master Bob, Lightsinger, Groundbreaker and Ice.Unique names for unique individuals with unique abilities.Abilities that they used to abuse and destroy."So I stepped in.When I saw you flying up there, summoning your lightning onto cars and trees, I knew I had to use my power to stop you.I guess that was my destiny.I spoke to you.Do you remember what I said?"she asked."'Stop.Stop this before anyone gets hurt.Stop or I'll take your power away.'I remember.You were in my mind.Talking to my thoughts.You were just a kid."I said, remembering, startled."Nineteen.But yeah.I'm a telepath.I can control people through their minds.My abilities surfaced a month before you did.But didn't go around screwing things up.I guess my parents raised me right.""And the others after me?""All nine of you I'm keeping tabs on.Making sure you move on smoothly.Groundbreaker owns a gift shop.And I used to work there while I got my PhD in psychology.Master Bob, Jailbreaker, Great Giggle and Mannequin are doing well.Lightsinger and Ice are going in and out of rehab for substance abuse, unfortunately.But at least they aren't freezing or frying anyone who looked at them wrong.Pyromancer is out of town.Visiting a cousin in India.He's doing relatively well, too.""And you?""I'm a therapist.Trying my best to see all of you.""So what?You're a saint?Guiding the wicked to the right path?"She looked at me, a flash of anger in her eyes."What I did to all of you was perverted.It was gross and wrong.Mind reading is just plain criminal.No one should have the power to invade another's mind and control what they know or remember.But it had to be done.Because you all were abusing your gifts and we're on the road to becoming full fledged psychopaths.I had the power to stop it.So I did.But I'm no saint."She said."And yet you're here, to see us through.Making sure we do right by society.Giving us a second chance.Seems saintly to me.""Stop it.What are you going to do now?""You tell me, telepath.""Didn't you hear a word of what I just said?I don't believe in reading another being's thoughts."I sighed."You're on a weird path of righteousness.But I believe in you.If you really think I can move on, then I will.In my cupboard is a briefcase.It's my link to the Weatherman.I want you to promise me that you'll burn it.Burn it before you take away one last memory.""You want me to make it as if this session never happened."she guessed, taking a deep breath and steeling her resolve."You read my mind."I smiled.
