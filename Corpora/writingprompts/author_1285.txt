His last chapter talked about the last man he had met, me.We sat at a bar far past midnight drinking our sorrows away like we always did throughout our later lives, but we had never met until one fateful encounter at a pub.Sitting on stools stiff and seemingly brittle, the discomfort of each other's lives could still be seen  not soley due to our demeanour.Our stances seemed to sink into shells, as if to hide our real selves, hinding an underlying secret no one should know.Across the bar I saw him, and bought him a drink.We talked, laughed, and left to go on our way.But there was only one way after our meeting for my aquaintace.It was the last real conversation he had with another person before he took his own life.I thought nothing of the man the day we met, the day we talked and shared stories.Only that he was one of many more to come.But to him, I was an ear.I was one who listened, who spoke back to him, who gave him conversation.Simple things.I suppose that fateful day would remain obscured by more prominent passages of my past from my perspective, but it was to be his last, a sad and lonely end.Stories are made to be experience and understood.It is a shame I could not go back to that day, and truly hear what he had to say.Maybe it was not something more important than what was happening around us at the time, but what was happening within us.
