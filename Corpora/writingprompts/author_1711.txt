I am not an experienced author so any feedback would be appreciated :) This doesn't exactly fit the prompt but I liked the idea of an origin story.______________


In the beginning there was nothing.Then there was a Something.This Something was a great being, made of five elements, swirling into a colossal form that sparkled like a star, flowed like a river, swirled like the wind, moved like a boulder and it's mind was pure magic.But no matter how beautiful this Something was, it was alone.The Something was so very lonely that it took parts of itself and began creating, for it was better to be smaller with something else to share it with.The first thing it made was a ball of earth, with water to bind it, and warmed by fire, and some magic so it could talk with the Something.They spent many long conversations discussing where they came from.The second thing it made was a nebulous cloud of steam, heated by flame, and of course, a sparkle of magic so it could talk.It loved to talk about why they were here, and their place in the universe.The third thing it made was dense and rocky and scorched by fire that raced around it, with gusts of wind to keep its blazing furnace skin alight.Again, it had a coating of magic so they could discuss what they could achieve together.The fourth thing it made was a great maelstrom of freezing dirt and air whirling round and round.By the time it came to give this thing magic the Something realised this was the last magic it had to give.It had kept back a little of everything else to ensure it could keep working, but it had enjoyed the conversation so much it had forgotten to save some magic.As the Something gave its last little piece of magic, it curled up into a tight ball in between its new friends and fell very quiet for a long long time.This fourth promised to protect the Something from all harm, for giving it life.While the Something may have been only earth, air, water and fire, it began to blossom and grow.Those questions it had asked, and the conversations enjoyed with its friends had woken something in its very skin, which called itself humanity.This humanity grew and questioned and gazed up at the sky where the four friends lived and in time called them planets.
