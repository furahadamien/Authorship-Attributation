When Johnny stopped his braggin, with gold fiddle at his feet, 
He saw the Devil smiling with a snack or two to eat.And then the skies grew dark and heavy like a twister in July
and a voice came with those awful winds and made a potent cry.THE DEVIL IS A SONUVABITCH THAT MUCH FOR SURE IS TRUE.BUT NOW YOULL MEET HIS PAPPY, SON I'D LIKE A WORD WITH YOU.YOUR FIDDLE SKILLS ARE WONDROUS, LO, AMONG A CHOSEN FEW.BUT I MADE ALL OF CREATION AND ITS TIME FOR YOUR ROUND 2.SO HERE'S THE TERMS YE MORTAL
DAREST NOT TO MISCONSTRUE
PLAY YOUR GOD, JEHOVAH, FOR ETERNAL LIFE OR SUFFERING FOR YOU

Now Johnny was a godly man, but prideful to a fault.And hearing God almighty only caused him to exalt.You know that my name's Johnny and I KNOW that it's a sin
But I'll take yer bet, and you're gonna regret, cause I'm the best there's ever been.

Johnny rosin up your bow and play like neer before
Cause God is loose in Dixie to settle a braggarts score.And if you win you'll get to play your fiddle ever more
But if you lose you'll burn or worse for surrrreeeeeee
