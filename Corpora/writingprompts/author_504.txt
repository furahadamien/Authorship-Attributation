Your eyes narrow for a split second as your world shifts into focus: All of your father's mysterious comments, the "summer camps" where you learned survival and hunting, your mysterious fetish for honey.All the bees are yours.You know what do.The world will feel the bitter sting of vengeance."Bathe the planet in blood.Spread the word our day has come.Drown them in sorrow.Murder the weak, the young, and the 
cowardley in their homes.Let despair take the strong before we hunt them.Kill every last squirrel."
