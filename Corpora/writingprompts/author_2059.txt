The universe was in balance, or so we thought.In a moment, whole systems began going dark.Conversations over eons cut short.Billions of years of memories gone blank.Confusion spread, then alarm.For the first time in [4 billion years], we conducted a census.92.5 billion.From 100 billion, our population for as long as we remember.Some kind of new plague?The bravest of us went off to look at the remains of our sisters.They came back with nothing.Just dead beings floating in the cosmos.Is the universe shrinking?Maybe thats the cause of our lower population.Nothing indicated that our universe was dying however, and this hypothesis was shelved.With every moment that passed, our population shrank, and it shrank exponentially.Some began to resign, and accept death as it came.Until we found it.A planet around a star.Insignificant, but for those who live on it.Tiny meaty creatures, with two legs.The rate of their population growth and the rate of our decline were identical.We did the math.100 Billion, our combined population.For every two-legged creature born, one of us dies.Outrage spread.Why are our lives equivalent?Why should one insignificant speck with a miniscule capacity for thought be equal with us, who span whole systems, who can solve the riddles of the universe with ease?One species for the survival of another.The only logical solution.It seemed easy enough at the time.We sent a few meteorites their way, enough to render the planet uninhabitable for their fragile little bodies.It would take a while, yes.But in due time, these two-legged creatures would plague them no more.The first asteroid hit, and then another.Rolling waves of fire and ash covered the surface.We turned away and began to slowly rebuild our population.Except we couldnt.We conducted another census.The second in just [2000] years!Unbelievable!99 billion, it said.We kept conducting regular censuses, every [100 years] or so.The data didnt lie.We were shrinking again.Another call was made for a return to Earth.When we got there, the planet was still in ruins.It wasnt the two-legged folk.Or we thought.At the very limits of my sense, I detected a small metal ship, filled with those same creatures we thought were extinct.We looked closer.Millions of small ships and tiny habitable pods were seeded across their system, as well as the systems surrounding it.Thousands of tiny cities were attached to asteroids and moons and planets.It was panic this time.How could we eradicate them now?In every nook and cranny of a star system lay a human settlement.We continue to send asteroids and comets to any planet or moon of sufficient size.It was no good.We kept dying.In time, the asteroids were stopped.They were blown up, redirected, or the target just moved out of the way.Agony.Something had destroyed one of my limbs.They were here.They spoke.One species for the survival of another.I resigned myself to my fate.___
If you have any criticisms, please let me know!I'm always trying to improve.Some criticisms of myself are that I failed to capture a real alien feel, that the voice of my narrator is a bit inconsistent, and that I had an issue with the scale of time for the species of the narrator and humanity.I changed my mind on the ending too many times, and it's not really that great.At one point I wanted humanity to be glassed, and then I wanted an ending where they came to a peaceful solution, and then a violent ending with humanity losing, and so on.At least I finished a story, haha.
