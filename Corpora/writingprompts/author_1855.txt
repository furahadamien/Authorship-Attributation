So there we were- me, Mikey, Rabbit, White Johnny, Black Johnny, and Ninja Steve- sitting around the rec room, watching TV.The new President was saying something about how resilient the nation was, and how we would prevail and rebuild and blah blah blah.Suddenly, a zombie leapt out from stage left and began eating his face.Screams and chewing noises filled the rec room.I guess the Vice President becomes President again said White Johnny, unwrapping a Snickers.I dont think this one got around to naming a Vice President said Black Johnny.Which means the Speaker of the House becomes President.Not the Secretary of State?

Nah.Speaker of the House is an elected position, so he or she is in the line of succession ahead of- no, wait, the Speaker is eating the Secretary of Transportation.

We all sat and watched quietly for a while.I dont know if youve ever been in prison, but its a lot nicer without guards.Nobody to tell you to stop watching TV if something excessively violent comes on.Nobody to make you talk to the government psychologists.Nobody to drag you to Level Five for the government doctors to experiment on to see if you always draw an inside straight or if you survive after being deliberately infected with smallpox or if the gun always malfunctions when they try and shoot you in a vital area or whatever.We used to have guards.Lots of them.And scientists, of course.But then Colonel Noah gathered all PROJECT ARK employees in the exercise yard to make some kind of speech about the temporary situation, as the TV called it.He ranted and raved at them for a while as we sat in our cells and listened.And then we heard a sound like a million car accidents at once.Near as we could figure out, two cargo planes had collided over our top secret little facility.One had carried food, water, and even a bunch of booze and drugs hidden inside crates labeled VEGETABLE OMELET MRE DO NOT USE AFTER JULY 1986.The other plane had carried a bunch of X-Boxes, games, and porn.Somehow, the flaming wreckage had killed all the government people, yet the cargo had remained perfectly intact.Colonel Noahs helmet had been blasted right off, ricocheted off a wall, and had shot right through an open window in a guard booth, and bounced off the OPEN CELL DOORS button, letting us all out.Pretty lucky of us, in other words.We were the safest humans in America, sitting pretty behind thick walls, an electrified fence, a moat, three minefields, and another moat, watching on TV while half the country ate the other half.Im going to go play X Box I said.Let me know if they announce a new President.
