I had just returned from my stint in Afghanistan with 2Rex in the back we had some forced leave and as a treat I was taking him out into the back country.Hes not really allowed off base but again no-one was gonna stop us.We'd done this before and it really clears the mind a and both of us could use the r and r. 

We made it up into the Rockies and had been hunting and relaxing for the best part is a will before bad weather started to settle in.So back in the pick up and the long drive back.lightening started as we were driving and the thunder started to remind me of the sound of war.2Rex was feeling it too and began whinging from the back.I pulled over and opened his box as lightning cracked above.I reacted by driving for my fox hole and he drove beside me as we had done countless times before.I realized his time had come and mine too.We stopped off at a diner on the way home and I let him let him out while I went inside.I came back out to find him playing with a little girl.He had his youth back and his puppy was coming out again.A lady came out and said oh she just loves dogs smiling at her daughter.I replied "take care of them for me then"

"So you're back again?When are you going to stop visiting me old man"

"When you're rehabilitated or near enough"."You know my old man is gone right and he was still an asshole when he died"

"Yea well I like to think he was less of an asshole at the end".Max was like clockwork every Tuesday and Thursday turning up at my place.I always gave him a hard time that he can't save me or my mates but the one day he didn't turn up I nearly tore the city down looking for him.That was the day the mayor realised I could get to him and anyone of his little
League at will.I played my hand and played it hard put 14 of the fuckers in hospital before they found him.He had been saving his neighbours kid from the local bullies.After that the mayor even made sure the league cleaned up the streets around Max's hood so he wouldn't miss an appointment.It must seam funny this impenetrable fortress surrounded by the worst of the worst guarding its location and this old man walks straight through all the defences.I make sure the boys put up a little show but they know if they touch him they answer to me.Maximum Damage the last of the league of legends my fathers greatest advisory.They nearly killed each other countless times.My fathers powers of radiation manipulation and Max's unlimited strength meant they matched each other well.When my old man was finally caught Max visited him every day in prison and some how when dad escaped 20yrs later he found him and still came by every day.By that stage I was running the show and dads powers were killing him.Towards the end I told my dad I'd take Max out for him as one last gotcha.He said "We don't kill family".
