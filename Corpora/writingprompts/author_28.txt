Ever since he was a child, Adolf has had a strong and competitive rivalry with his schoolmate, Abraham Silverstein.Growing up, they shared a love and passion for painting, but Adolf was always the more talented of the pair.Eventually, fed up with Adolf, Abraham Silverstein began using his fathers connections to promote and market his own talent.Being the son of a wealthy banker, Abraham Silverstein began using his father's connections to get his artwork displayed in galleries across Germany.After graduating, Adolf was happy for Abraham Silverstein; to see his friend have such success, but this just infuriated Abraham Silverstein.Slowly, they began to drift apart.With Abraham Silverstein's influence, teachers discouraged and even scorned Adolf when he would proudly show off his work, writing them off as mere childrens' doodles.At first, Abraham Silverstein felt bad, but when he saw how much better Adolf was at painting, he would get angry.One day, Adolf went to the art room in school and saw that his paintings he'd left in the class were destroyed!"This is horrible, who'd do such a thing" called out Abraham Silverstein from behind Adolf.He turned around to see a slight grin on Abraham Silverstein's face, and began to tremble.He said nothing and left.The days went by, and Adolf became more and more isolated...Eventually, strange men wearing unique clothing began to appear in Adolf's life.These men were actually assassins from the future!Repeatedly, Adolf would be chased down by men wearing strange outfits, and his life became a living nightmare.Adolf had no idea what was going on, but knew that they had to have been hired by Abraham Silverstein!There was simply no other explanation.Eventually, Adolf graduated and thought he could finally move on from the suffering he'd been experiencing.To his surprise, however, every art school he applied to had rejected him.A knock could be heard from his door, and when Adolf went to answer, a messenger handed him a letter.Strangely enough, it was a letter from Abraham Silverstein!Opening the letter, Abraham Silverstein had written of how he had gotten into one of the most prestigious art schools in all of Germany.With every word, a feeling of bitterness washed over Adolf again and again until eventually, he noticed a note at the end... "It's so sad that you didn't make it into any art schools, perhaps it just wasn't meant to be".Adolf stood there for a moment, stunned and confused as to how Abraham Silverstein was aware of his rejections, until eventually it all clicked, and Adolf flew into a rage.With this, his childhood aspirations were dashed.Adolf had almost given up on art altogether.He began to take interest in politics and government affairs, but in his apartment there always sat a blank canvas, waiting for him.One day, a mysterious man with gorgeous hair and a voice as sweet as angels showed up at his door.At first, Adolf thought it was another thug hired to attack him, but the man just stood there smiling at him.The man simply walked past him and stared at the canvas in Adolf's apartment.Adolf was worried; his mind was racing, thinking whether he can make it past the man and grab the kitchen knife on the table.All of a sudden, the man turned back to him and said "ready to have some fun?"and pulled out a set of brushes and paint from his bag!Adolf, bewildered by the appearance of the strange man, was apprehensive at first.Eventually, Adolf thought that he didn't have much left to live for, and decided to just join in, resigning himself to his fate.He had figured the man was an assassin hired by Abraham Silverstein, but merely killing him was not enough.The man clearly wanted to invigorate his love for art again, just to take it all away from him before ending his life.Adolf followed along with the man hoping that at the very least, his end would be swift and painless.Strangely enough, the end never came for Adolf.Hours became days, and days became weeks.Adolf had forgotten everything he had previously thought or felt and became engulfed in the world of art.The man, only known by the name "Bob", had given life to Adolf's once dark life.Canvas after canvas began to pile up around his apartment, and one day Bob turned to Adolf and said, "why don't you share this with the world?".Adolf was hesitant.He had found his passion again, but was worried about how things might turn out if he shared it.Never the less, he eventually caved in and showed it to a local curator.The curator was amazed and word began to spread.Immediately, this unknown 21 year old artist had sprung up on the art scene in Germany.The public heard rumors about an amazing exhibition that was about to unveil, and anticipation was rising.The curator boasted about his discovery of this new talent, a talent only matched in this generation by Abraham Silverstein.Abraham Silverstein, hearing the news, became enraged.He began to tear up his current piece he was working on, and began to think.All of a sudden, it struck him.The gallery that Adolf was going to debut at was owned by a close friend of the family.Using his connections, Abraham Silverstein borrowed a set of keys to "admire" the artwork before the official debut the next day.The night before the grand exhibition, Adolf was nervous and unable to sleep."It'll be fine, just sit down and have nothing in mind... feel good about yourself and the world".Adolf calmed down, and eventually went to sleep.In the middle of the night, Adolf suddenly awoke from a nightmare.He had a sinking feeling, and suddenly rushed out of the apartment, heading to the gallery, while Bob just sat there in the apartment, staring at a blank canvas with an eerie smile across his face.When Adolf got there, he found that the gallery lights were on.He rushed in to see what happened, and notice Abraham Silverstein taking one of his paintings off the wall.Out of the corner of his eye, Adolf spotted a stack of other paintings he had poured his soul into, all with cuts across them.A knife lay on the ground nearby.Enraged, Adolf grabbed the knife and charged at Abraham Silverstein.Hearing footsteps, Abraham Silverstein turned around and saw Adolf.A look of terror crossed Abraham Silverstein's face as Adolf ran into him, plunging the knife into his stomach.Abraham Silverstein collapsed, and Adolf sat there, reality slowly beginning to wash over him.Adolf looked at his hands, stained in blood.He fell to his knees, sobbing."What have I done?"said Adolf."I've made a horrible mistake".A sweet voice rang out behind Adolf, "We don't make mistakes".Adolf hesitated before slowly turning around.He saw Bob, smiling as if nothing was wrong with the world."We have happy accidents".Adolf was stunned, and confused."How can I fix this though, I've killed a man!", he said.Bob replied, "don't worry about it, learn how to use what happened".Adolf looked down, deep in contemplation.Slowly, memories swept over him, memories of how his future had been ruined by this man who had once been his friend.He had been betrayed, and the more he thought about what happened over the years, the angrier he became.Bob walked past Adolf and picked up the painting dropped by Abraham Silverstein.He took out a brush, and began smacking it."I like to beat the brush", he said.Then he dipped the brush in the blood on the floor and began to paint over the canvas.What was once a bright, clear sky became a crimson evening scene.He then turned to Adolf and said "we artists are a different breed of people.We're a happy bunch".Adolf stood there, contemplating as he looked at the painting.Adolf stared at the painting, mesmerized by the sight."This painting... it speaks to me, but I don't understand what it means..." Adolf muttered."If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is", Bob said."You have to find your own meaning in it".And with that, Bob handed the brush to Adolf and left.After hours had passed, Adolf had faded in and out of his own thoughts.Eventually, he heard a noise from the entrance, and knew that he had to leave soon.Running through the back door, painting in hand, a scream could be heard from inside the gallery.Adolf knew he had to clean up and change out of his clothes.No sooner had Adolf gotten home and changed, did someone burst through his door screaming "there's been a disaster!".Adolf was suspected, but was never tried for the incident at his gallery.His artwork became stigmatized, and people began to wonder what happened.Some believe it to be a simple crime, others whispered of the supernatural.Regardless, Adolf could never be featured in the art world again.This didn't matter to Adolf, however.Every day he would study the painting left by Bob.Sometimes he would even try to recreate it, but to no avail.Eventually he remembered that it wasn't paint that Bob used, but was blood.He realized at that moment that his passion could not be achieved with mere paint and a canvas.Adolf set out on his path for a new kind of paint, and his canvas would be the world.
