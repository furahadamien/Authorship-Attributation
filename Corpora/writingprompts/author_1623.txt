I was weak.After the car crash my life has been slipping away.I could barely stand anymore.Then it was my birthday.I had to celebrate it in the hospital.My parents got me a a VR headset as I was putting it on I suddenly felt very dizzy.I was loosing consciousness fast, that last thing I remembered was my dad putting on the headset on me.Quiet, everything was dark and quiet.Then I heard trees rustling and wheels rolling on gravel.I opened my eyes and saw that I was in a carriage then I heard a loud voice "Hey you, your finally awake.You were trying to cross the border right?"God dang it Howard you done it again
