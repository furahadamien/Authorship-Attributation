Turns out the universe isn't cold and uncaring.Turns out the universe actually wants to give us what we want.Turns out 8 billion people all projecting their wishes out into the fuzzy warm-hearted void of existence confuses the heck out of the old machinery.What I mean to say is of the bunch of us humans shouting at mama universe, those who got what they were wishing for were few and far between; the odd miracle here and there, a lucky toss once in awhile.You get it.It's different now.When the culling began, I...no, let me skip this part.Slowly, during the months after the event, people thought they were going crazy.Some of the surviving doctors called it PTSD or something.The more susceptible started hearing this background chatter emerge from the white noise narrated stream of consciousness.Took us another 4 billion lost for the first to get it.They were hearing the fearful calls of their brethrens minds.Some of the resistance stands got 'lucky.Nothing sustainable, remotely helpful in the big picture; not that any even put it even together until way later anyways.On the way down to the last wretched few all of this got stronger, more noticeable until even most doubting could no longer deny having joined their fellow men (as few of us as remained) in a shared mind.Some called it God, some Gaia, some just called it magic.It really dont matter.Once you figure out that you dreamed up this world together, it's not a huge stretch of imagination to imagine the intruders gone.Wasn't even a fight anymore.Billions lost, just a few ragged men and women with the power to raise cities from the oceans.We prospered fast, as they say we did before.But we also grew fast.Now, only very few can still hear the voices of mind and even fewer can get their small wishes heard by the void.****


The old man harrumphed, happy with his audience's captivated gazes.He sharpened his minds words into a needle tip of will and let it fly, making the fire in the cave in their midst flare, just for a second.His tribe exclaimed with exaltation at the power their shaman wielded.
