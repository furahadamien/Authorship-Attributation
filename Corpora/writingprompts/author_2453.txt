Upon his perch Damien Red scanned the horizon.His ivory tower menaced over a bleak decaying city scape.He thought momentarily about the dregs of the people and their plight as his Industrial smoke stacks spewed toxicity into the skies.Energy and power synonymous with his name yet he cared neither about his fortunes nor the lives of every single living creature on earth.His propose was to watch the earth destroy itself and at this very moment he took it all in.At long last he could enjoy a brief reflection upon his work.His goals meted out through a succession of events and decisions that were brutal as they were effective.He had levied everything against the reactionaries and reformers.The do gooders; trying to keep the human race going.It was unnatural.An aberration.Now it was on the verge of being snuffed out.By his hands alone, his master plan.All the resources continued to dwindle.He watched famine, war, death and decay slowly strangle the human spirit, where it needed to be annihilated.There was to be no oasis, no new resurgence or awakening.The humans needed to suffer for what theyve done.He smiled as it unfolded before him.Red reminisced about his early career and his SpaceEX ventures.Thousands of satellites orbited the earth under his careful instruction and design.His propaganda machine kept the masses idle and ignorant.His clean energy solutions were anything but.His satellites weaponized.He remembers the first push back from the eco-environmentalists; the Algorians.He had managed to cut the head off the snake quite easily by obliterating there leader with a careful laser beam strike while eating a grilled cheese sandwich.Delta Force 74 tried to storm his tower to little effect.They were cut down by his fortified security systems and faithful loyalists.When governments tried with all there might to subdue him and his enveloping control over all things global and economic, they were easily corrupted and bought out, furthering his resolve that the human race was hopeless.He remembers Clark Wayne.His favourite.A tortured man like himself.He was the polar opposite of Red.Altruistic, charming and good.He had got so close to beating Red in their final showdown that Red erected a statute of him in his lobby.Red was able to neutralize the great Clark Wayne with the simple practice of training his henchmen.Investing in his loyal henchmen paid off when Goon number 237 was able to get up from a broken knee and flank Mr. Wayne with a simple gunshot to the temple.He savoured the moment the crimson red pooled around his exposed skull.When all threats diminished and expired.He breathed in deep.He looked at his red launch button and reflected... maybe Ill let them suffer, just a week longer.
