There was a moment when I realized new owner wasn't going to hurt me.She was working in the basement, and I had gotten a hold of one of her gloves.It smelled nice, so I started chewing on it.I hear her say suddenly "What *is* that noise?"When she came and saw what I was doing, she got mad, and her hands went up so I shrank and tried to make myself as little as possible.Then I heard her say "Oh my god, I wasn't going to hurt you."She knelt down and hugged me.I knew then what my new home was going to be like.I don't remember much about old owner.I still have the white spot on my nose from where I tried to push my way out of the crate he put me in.He left me alone a lot.When new owner came to the shelter, I was in another cage, and I barked and snarled at anyone who came near me.But she asked to take me for a walk, and she knew somehow that I wasn't a bad dog.I just didn't like to be in small spaces.She never left me in one again.Her and an older lady who smelled like her took me a long way in the rumbling cage with seats.I don't like those.I throw up in them sometimes.But it was worth it.My new home had a nice big backyard and a fence I could bark at.New owner wasn't home all the time, but the older lady was most of the time, making clicking sounds in front of a bright square.She would let me sit with her until new owner came home.I really liked that, I was never alone anymore.New owner took me for lots of long walks when she came home.If she got mad at me, she usually ended up laughing afterwards or sometimes even hugging me.Except that time I chased the skunk, then she had to walk me a really, really long way to get smelly stuff and water poured over me.There was an older man there, too, who kind of smelled like her and who treated me nicely too.Sometimes he brought me bones and would let me outside if I whined.The older ones would walk me sometimes when owner was sick.Lately, I haven't been able to walk as far or as long, and my tummy hurts a lot.New owner took me to the place that smelled kind of like the skunk shampoo and where I would scare all the other dogs.She argued with the older ones a couple times after.They took me a few times.After the last one, new owner cried a bunch.But then she spent all week with me.She fed me all kinds of food I had never been allowed before.She even slept on the upstairs couch beside me so I didn't have to go up and down the stairs.Her and the older man are taking me back to the smelly place now, I can tell.They always smell different when they take me there.She seems like she's trying to keep from crying, and when she smiles at me I can tell she's hurting inside a lot.She's barely aged at all since I first met her, still young and full of energy.I've been getting more and more tired, and I wish I could keep up with her.I wish my tummy didn't hurt so much, or that they could fix it like the skunk smell.The one in the white coat and her talk for a bit, and then they poked me with one of the little needles.As the world went dark, I felt her arms tight around me, and heard her say over and over that she loved me, and that I was a good dog.--PS:  This was actually my experience with a shelter rescue (part German Shepard) that I had to put down 6 years ago.We only got 5 years together, and I still miss him terribly.Putting him down was the single hardest thing I've ever had to do.Wherever he came from, if you gave him a good home, then you should be proud.I'm sorry for your loss.
