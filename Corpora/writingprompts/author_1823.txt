*Y'all need to lighten up a touch.The dogs I've known have all been more joyful than maudlin.*

There is a record, of sorts, in the Family Tree.It reminds you of who you are, and who your Family is.How they are, and how they've been.In the Tree, you have a witness to past times both of hardship and of joy.Sometimes, on particularly warm days, the Family Tree even teases you with glimpses of your parents.And your parents' parents.On rare occasion, you can even smell the generations stretching all the way back to The Elder, the first Dog to live there.Yes, the sprawling old elm in the middle of The Grass had served and sheltered our Family for five generations, but it held no answers for what would come next for us.We had to face that future on our own.The Master had been getting frailer, you see.He fell over three Winters ago (and I know what you're thinking, but he DIDN'T just want to play.I definitely checked).After that, he started using the Off-Limits Stick to get around, and as the days went on he began to use it more and more.Then, one morning, when my daughters were still pups, the world as we knew it ended.That morning, the three of us went to wake The Master for our morning walk, but nothing worked.We tried nuzzling, jumping, barking, rough-housing on top of him, the whole works.Even pressing our noses to his nice, warm eyelids didn't evoke the high-pitched yelp of sudden and unwelcome consciousness we were used to.I needn't tell you how much we miss him.Surely you can smell it for yourself as we speak, even after all this time.But life has a way of working itself out, young one.See, I grew up with MastersSon.My parents adored him, and he was my best friend when I was a pup and he was not yet full-grown.Eventually, he left to start his own Family out here, but I was always so happy when he'd bring your parents over for the Big Family Parties.I got to show them our Family Tree, and let them add to its record.Now, I'll admit, MastersSon has a lot to learn about the art of neck scratches, but his choice of Treats and Table Scraps is *impeccable.*

I'll never forget the day he came to get my daughters and I, and brought us to join his Family here in our new home.The new Yard is shady and green, and MastersSon's young pup is a drooling mess who clearly needs a steady paw to guide it.The trees out back have very little history on them, but we can certainly work on that.Edit: whoops, forgot to finish a sentence.
