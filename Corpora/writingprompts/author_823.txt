It had all come down to this.I stand upon this roof top silently contemplating my life.I had always been the compassionate type.Each day I made as many selfless acts as possible.I don't like to see anyone or anything struggle.I am the type of person that always gave away my spare change, helped elderly women across the street, and even things most people wouldn't blink about like setting spiders outside instead of killing them.I had spent my life helping the helpless.Maybe because I knew what it was like to be helpless.There was no good reason why I was depressed.I had a fairly normal childhood.Nothing stands out that could've potentially lead to my depression.None of that really mattered anyway.I've grown tired of trying to help those around me, because every time I begin to feel as if I'd made an impact, I realize the world is just as desolate as before.I've never felt amy sense of purpose or belonging.In my eyes, all the caring I've done never amounted to anything in my life.My last wish is that my impact is remembered by somebody, anybody.I feel a cold rush of air overcome my senses.It fills my nostrils, makes my eyes water, whistles through my ear, sends shivers across my skin and violently thrashes my long unkept hair.I have no time to think, it doesn't feel fast or slow it just kind of happens.As I begin to realize the gravity of the situation I collide with something.I yelp, shortly before realizing that I feel no pain.For a brief moment I am going upwards until I come down and fall delicately into what appears to a large tightly woven spider web!The crescent moon lighting allows me to barely make out, that I am about ten feet above the ground.Slowly I see hundreds, maybe more, spiders come into focus.From all angles I see eightfold eyes staring back at me, and then they begin to move in a flurry of excitement, Quickly they disperse leaving a small area clear and obvious.Spelled out a l Charlotte's Web, I make out the words, "Today you, tomorrow me."It turns out that all of these years someone remembered all that I had done.
