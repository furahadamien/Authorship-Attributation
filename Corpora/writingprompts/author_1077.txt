death-and-dahlias
I had been following the lines since I got lost at the mall, it lead be right back to my mom.But that was ages ago.Now it had given me everything, a wife, a big house, and a well paying job I loved.But I missed the struggle, the martyrdom of it all.The red line still shimmered like a great snake, always the darker of the two.Where the green called with a cheerful prospect of something happy, the red was mystery.The unknown.Until that lazy Saturday morning.I packed a bag and told my wife I was going on a hike.It wasn't a lie but it wasn't exactly the truth...

    After a few hours I realized I was on trail above a dense forest, with a creek bubbling down the center.Then I saw it.Heard it first but I passed it off as the river.Singing.A woman's voice, not overly highly or sweet.More like a slightly out of tune musical.Well she was singing "do you hear the people sing" 

    I finally said something as the song was ending, "Hello?""I hoped you'd say something eventually," she said, turning around and smiling.She wasn't exactly pretty but she has the sort of wildness that wind broken sagebrush did.She was wearing a gray dress that sparked red with the light."So you finally decided to follow the red line?"I nodded."Finally.I do suppose you're about to ask who I am?""Yes actually.""I'm the one who makes the lines, the painter.More classical pieces may know me as Lady Fate.""Fate?Like actual Fate personified?""Yup.""So you're the reason I've gotten all that I have?You lead me there?""No, that was my sister, Fortune.I just draw the lines.""Well of course..."

    "It's a shame you people have forgotten us, not even everyone has the lines anymore.""Who else has them?""Well your wife has them, really the only reason you're together..."

    "What?!""That's a story for another time, come and sit, I need to tell you something."I sat down on a rock near her cabin, which I now saw was whitewashed with a red brick chimney.She stepped inside for a moment and returned with a tray of tea and little scones that she set down on a table that I could've sworn wasn't there before."Now let's get to the matter of saving the world, shall we?"
