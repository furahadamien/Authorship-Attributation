My hand reached out from the messy nest of blankets I was buried under, and flopped onto the buzzing phone on my dresser.Bleary-eyed and dazed, I dragged it under the blankets with me, refusing to let myself be fully roused from a solid nights sleep."What the fuck," I muttered to myself, nearly mumbling the words out loud.With a pained squint of too much brightness far too suddenly, I looked at the screen and saw - jesus, had to be hundreds of notifications, at least.Which was weird enough; me getting messages from 100+ people?Not enough people like me for that to be a common occurrence.But weirder still was they all said the same exact thing, "It's a beautiful night tonight.Look outside."Bitches, it's basically morning, I thought.But before I could move, let alone shake the cozy cocoon of blankets from my head to look out my window and see what could possibly be so damn beautiful, my phone buzzed again.I practically jumped as it shocked my hand.There was a new message, but this one said something different, "DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON.""What?"This time I actually did speak out loud.Frustration now fully replaced by curiosity and a racing heart, I kicked the blankets off and staggered down the hall to my roommates bedroom."Mon?"I called, knocking on her closed door.Mon was short for Monica.We had only been roommates for a short time - me, in desperate need of a new apartment, and her, with a newly empty house gifted by her parents - but friends for about a year.There was no answer.I tried again, "Mon?You up?"I shivered, which was odd.Sure, I was dressed only in a long tee shirt but it had been spring for weeks now; it should have been enough to feel warm in this house.I heard a loud THUD and bang from inside Monica's room."Monica?Are you okay?"When still there was no answer, I threw open the door.There was Monica, hanging from the light fixture.Her heavy wooden desk stool lay toppled on the floor beneath her."Oh my god!"I screamed, "Monica!"I raced to her feet, held them, grabbed the stool and placed them under her feet.But her body had gone extraordinarily limp in such a short time.Phone in hand, I called 911.Busy signal.What?How...I pulled the phone away from my ear, my other arm still wrapped around Monica's ice cold legs.The blaring sound seemed to fill the air as I tried to comprehend how this could be possible.All right, no problem, let's try again, I thought, swallowing hard and trying not to shake.Busy signal, again.What the hell could be happening, I thought, feeling the stirrings of real panic start to fill my body.There was a TV in Monica's room.I gingerly placed Monica's feet on the table, then ran to grab the remote sitting on her night table.I clicked, and my eyes were suddenly swimming in the bright colors and video of New Channel One.Almost instantly, I felt my knees buckle from under me."Sources are reporting a sweep of suicides all over the nation," the newscaster was saying in a somber and serious tone.Her blood red lipstick matched her blazer as she went on, mouth uttering words that made me believe this all could only be a dream."911 is overwhelmed with floods of calls.Police called to hundreds upon thousands of scenes of jumpers immediately shot themselves upon looking upward.No one is quite yet sure as to what the correlation might be-" 

I turned away from the tv, staring down at the phone in my hand.I looked over to Monica's desk and picked up her phone.She too, had hundreds of the "look outside" texts.But the one she didn't have - the warning not to look at the moon.My breath grew ragged, shallow, as I scrolled through her notifications and could not find a warning anywhere.And all I could think was: why me?'

Shane's knees felt stiff.He sighed as he went through the motions of getting dressed: sliding on his shoes, buckling his belt, pulling on his coat.Even the simplest of motions felt like a test of physical strength; "I'm getting too old for this shit, Riggs," echoed in his head.But Shane shook it off.He had a good 12 hours on his feet ahead of him at one of NYC's busiest clubs.He opened his front door and flicked off the last light of his empty, quiet apartment.He was turned to leave, but paused as the hallway lamps illuminated the glass of the framed photo sitting on the stand by the front door.He picked it up, letting just one look at his daughter give him the motivation he needed to get through this doorway.He sighed again, placed the photo back, and shut the door behind him.The air tonight was unseasonably warm, though October had proved itself to be a crapshoot, weather-wise, for the past few years now.Shane stood at the top of the stairs of the clubs entrance, leaning against the frame of the double doors.It gave him a surprisingly casual demeanor for the head bouncer.He used the stance to play up the mysterious, silent role he enacted while on the job, but in truth, it was to give his tired feet some reprieve.Regardless of what was behind it, the other door guys questioned nothing.Shane had been in the business for, seemingly, ever; his M.O.was known, understood, and respected by all bouncers.It was simple, really: Shane would give a slight nod to some customers waiting in line, not even glancing at their ID's, while others he would give one shake of the head.Sure, this certainly aided with the image any club wants to create, the "exclusive" bullshit.But that was just a lucky coincidence; Shane was, well, uniquely gifted for this job.He always had to laugh, thinking to himself, "What kind of stupid-ass superhero power bullshit is this?"But however useless it might be, it was his: Shane could see the age of every single person.No, not a rough estimate or educated guess by looking at sun damage or liver spots.An actual number, above their heads.It could become dizzying and exhausting when amongst crowds, which is why Shane had a tendency to avoid working music festivals or going anywhere with too many people.But to work the door, focus on a single line, was manageable.And nothing ever surprised him, given the club scene.The numbers were always the same small window of low to upper twenties, with the occasional sprinkling of desperate thirties, and the pitifully fooling-no-one-fourties.But then tonight, with that odd warm breeze wafting around the bubbling excitement of the Saturday night crowd, he saw something that actually threw him.There was a girl, not unlike any other of the fresh-faced, glowing and smiling young girls in line.Long straight blonde hair, leather skirt, black platform heels, white shirt.He blinked, frowned, furrowed his brow.He watched her, giggling and chatting with her group of friends.Shook his head as if that would change what he was seeing.How?He had seen a young-looking girl or two in their thirties before, sure, but this?He wanted to smack his head, but that instinct would be futile; he wasn't a machine or program to reboot.This was just something he had the power to see.And it was really there: a four digit number.He stared at her, at that number - 7129 - all sound seeming to melt from his ears until a, "Shane?Shane!"snapped him back to earth.He saw Brian, one of the other bouncers, looking at him and waiting for either the nod or the no.Shane, completely shaken, gave a loose confirmation that the girls could go in.As they passed him, The Girl looked right into his eyes, and mouthed, "I know what you can see."His mouth dropped and his gaze followed her as she waved goodbye to him and walked inside.
