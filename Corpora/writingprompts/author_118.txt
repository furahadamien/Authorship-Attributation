The movie begins and as it starts you realize you are watching yourself walking  around like normal.You start to think wow I wonder what this me will do so this is what the afterlife is I guess.You see on the screen you are an adult in this movie and whoa look!others that look like you start to show up in the movie.They all congregate together and decide to go to the movies together.How trippy!I wonder what they are going to see, they walk in, all sit down and start to watch the movie.The movie that begins playing for them looks familiar it seems like how your movie started?It feels familiar and the main character on screen looks like you.He goes and sits next to a you looking guy, with a red shirt.You pull yourself from the screen for a moment and catch out of the corner of your eyes the You next to you has on red and hes also staring at the screen.You cut your eyes back to the screen and convince yourself youre just being paranoid its only a movie.Then the you on screen turns and looks behind him right after you in his movie had turned his turns his head and looked behind him.Whats going on?Whats behind you?Slowly you turn your head and look behind you.
