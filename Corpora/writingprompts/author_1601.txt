GAH! Gasped the Homo ergaster, jerking upright and launching itself off its tree limb, falling a few feet to the ground.It lay there, gasping, grasping for the fleeting... memories?The memories of its... other life.In the future.It looked up and snatched the teardrop shaped stone it had spent so many hours... flint knapping?So many hours flint knapping to refine the shape and the edge, uncaring of the small cut it got from the razor sharp edge.Achooln Hndxe

Handaxe it finally said, its mouth not entirely made to form these sounds.It remembered this tool, this artifact, this Acheulean Handaxe from its prehistory class in college.This certainly does explain why it had become a paleoanthropologist.Unfortunately its memories of this strange future were slipping through its fingers, briefly reminding itself of A Dream Within A Dream by Poe.Lesser memories and thoughts were leaving it, childhood friends, family, places and their names.Only its greatest pleasures were left untouched; human history, literature, and power.When it was a modern man, it, then Curtis, didnt bother with family or fun, he only cared about the glory of past battles, of reading literature not for enjoyment but to lord it over others who couldnt afford the time to read more than necessary, of seeing where man came from to figure out where it would go and how to place himself at the forefront of that future.He did have one guilty pleasure though, comic books.Particularly the Detective Comics line, for their interesting plots he always enjoyed pulling apart.And for his favorite villain of those comics

Vandal Savage the H. ergaster said to itself, convinced that was who it was destined to be.It was at this point that the full grown Smilodon fatalis lunged at it from behind, having been attracted by the scent of blood and snuck up behind while it was busy thinking, and sank its two massive canines into the back of its head, killing the last Homo ergaster, and making way for its cousins H. erectus and H. heidelbergensis to officially take center stage.Leaving behind a skull that would, in time, become the only known example of Macairodont predation on human ancestors:

A hominid skull, with two massive puncture wounds.
