I watched the Reddit prompt scroll past, wishing the seasons greetings.I sighed and put my phone down, tired from the facade of Christmas cheer, that changed my face one a year.As was tradition I reached for the hidden box under the bed and pulled out the hard steel if the revolver, all but one cylinder barrel empty.I poured a glass of scotch and sat staring at the cold black metal, the weight felt so familiar in my hand.I rolled the cylinder and downed the scotch as it span, place the barrel to my temple and pulled the trigger.*Click*

The hammer contacted the priming cap, echoing its message down the bullet.The gun and bullet had been disabled years ago, the barrel narrowed, the shell empty.Now it just served as a reminder of my survival.I rejoined my family, satisfied I had lived through another year.I raise a final toast hoping the next one will be better.
