I was immediately uncomfortable, and began to argue with the little girl.She was not amused.How dare I crash her tea party and not be an exquisite guest!The little girl began to cry loudly.Suddenly there where rumbles of thunder from outside the room.My uncomfort would not subside, a feeling in my gut that began to move to my head.In fact it began to grow.Like a rumbling in the tummy when hungry, but with spasms and pain.The girl's crying grew exponentially to wailing.She had disinvited me - asked me to leave.I felt lost.How did I get here, where was I to go?Then, a blinding flash.Like a thermonuclear blast.Except there was no heat, no sound.Everything went black.The blackest dark of the vacuum of outer space.And now it was cold.Cold as the hand of death himself.Then it was all red.The red of hellfire!I had pissed off the gods indeed, and was in Hell!Yes, I have now been transported instead to the Republican Tea Party!
