I kind of put a twist at the end but just so it would be a little different.Tried my best to stick to the plot outline.Have you ever gotten that feeling?The feeling of just being, well lack for better words, scared?Well, thats what I felt like when I, James Legstrong got to mars.It was a long trip of about 3 years but it was worth it.We had been orbiting for the past day and had been looking for the best place to land.We decided on a nice clearing where there was some mountains nearby.After confirming with home, we got ready to rocket down to the red planet's surface.Even getting into the atmosphere, it looked like nothing I had ever seen before.Beautifully red and orange, it was the greatest thing I had ever seen.I also had an amazing feeling because I would be, along with my partner, the first people to ever set foot or lay eyes on it from this distance.We landed and had to put on our suits before we went out.My partner and I both shook hands and said that we stick together, while also doing the U.S salute.This was not only being broadcasted on live television, but listened to by most of the world.It was a monumental achievement.I stepped foot out first, with a big grin on my face.I looked around along with my partner and I noticed something quite Strange.There was another space pod already landed nearby.We contacted home only to see that it was not ours, or anything wed sent out previously.It was even in an odd shape with a disk.We decided that wed approach with caution.We got as close as we could, only to see that there was an imprint on the side of the pod.It was covered in the red dust so we had to wipe it off only to see something horrifying.At first it was just red, but as we got to the corners, we could see some yellow, then we saw it.It looked like a flag.My partner and I wanted to go in badly, but couldnt until we got confirmation.After a while of arguments between staff and others but they finally gave us permission.The pod door opened with a woosh sound of air flowing out.We got in to see a carnage of materials, notebooks, and clothes flung around.There was some type of creatures there.We were given directions not to touch them though, as they could be contaminated.There was also computers, so we decided to look through them.It had no password so we got on easily and opened a summary of the people on the vessel.After looking through we saw the species of these creatures, they were called humans.
