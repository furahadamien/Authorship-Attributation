So this was what the fuss was all about?Overpriced drinks, a clientele that wouldn't even look at you if you still didn't sport the "lumberjack" look, and some kind of starlet/Calvin Harris mash\-up was looping while the person pressing buttons on the laptop and "fist\-bumping" beautiful people entertained himself between each line.Thomas indeed was in hell.It looked a lot like London on the surface, but, it was most definitely, a gin\-soaked, "beard sporting" level of hell.She wasn't "At a point in her life where she could handle real life problems" apparently.He grumbled to himself while tapping his glass and pointing to another whiskey bottle.Sure.It was only his father dying of lung cancer, the company was only making "streamlined progression" decisions, and obviously the landlord was raising rent by a third so Thomas could say he lived in an "upmarket location".But these problems were all too "real" when you're an aspiring fashion model.Thomas necked another shot of something way too sugary and half\-focused on events at the will reading, earlier that day.\-\-\-

"...I bequeath my estate and all it's holdings to my dutiful daughter Helena, who should she actually be present at this reading, shall know that i forgive her for being somewhat "absent" in recent years".Even the solicitor looked embarrassed; while Thomas's sister dutifully \(heh\) wiped a tear and proclaimed something along the lines of "Oh Daddy..." and some other practiced script.Laughter erupted from the back of the room, as Thomas just threw his hands up and played right into his father's final joke."Of course!Her highness here gets the bloody mansion in Devon, and i get the book.I get the fucking book..."

A few hangeronatives fluttered on cue at the expletive while Thomas clutched ..."The Philosopher's stone" and he turned with an elegant bow."You'll forgive me you bunch of sycophantic tossers...but i am off to run head first into a fucking wall".\-\-\-

And so a few hours later, Thomas found himself amidst the predatory, the bewildered, the drunk and the one\-night stands that compromise  London transport at night; Fulfilling, out of some absolutely insane sense of compulsion, his father's dying wish...To charge headlong into several blocks of stone and concrete...He was too pissed to care how absurd it was.He even stamped his feet and made bull noises just for show."Mmroooooo!", and he charged.\-\-\-

Now usually, solid stone doesn't really move when a pissed, newly single, newly unemployed mortgage adviser runs into it at 12.48am on a Saturday morning.Usually there's some kind of \*THUD\*, coupled with a groan, varying degrees of concussion and a trip in an ambulance.Tonight wasn't "usually" night.Right about the point where Thomas was already saying "OW!"as he shoulder checked the large inanimate pieces of granite before him, something very, very weird happened.There was no "heavy slap" as puny human flesh met immovable unforgiving rock, in it's place was something like a "whoosh".A breeze.A whooshing breeze.Thomas did manage to fall over at least.So that was half normal...The other half of the un\-normal variety was the fact that he passed through a bone wrenching big block of pain and fell flat on his face at the foot of a very tall robed old man.Instinctively Thomas grabbed the robe and hoisted himself up, before being shoved backwards \(by the robe?\) into a more expected position.The drunken younger man held his hand out."S\-s\-sorry mate i must have barged into yo....Er, am i unconscious?"The old man looked down with a stern expression at the slurring drunkard and spoke."Thomas Marson of Albion.You fulfilled the dying wish of a fool.You have faith in the words of your father.You have renounced your old world.You have heeded the call of the Dreamers.I...Merlin have a task for thee".Thomas Marson of Albion blinked for a moment, and rubbed his eyes."So i'm not under arrest am i?".He asked, before he passed out this time.Properly.
