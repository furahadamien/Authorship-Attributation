John was happily driving his car to meet up with some family, when suddenly-- BAM!He couldn't really remind himself of what had happened, however, he was now sitting down, in a dimly lit room."Where am I?"John blurted out, looking around before finally looking down at his body and noting how perfectly fine he was.No bruises, cuts or scratches.- "B-But.. the accident?"He had no answers and seemingly there was no one else around to do so.Minutes turned into hours and, soon enough, a door cracked open.John went wide-eyed and even rubbed his eyes furiously, not really believing who now stood there, right in front of him."Hey-.." - A sort of squeakish voice greeted."This isn't possible- How?What?"- John rubbed his eyes once more and sighed before looking up at the figure once more."You're me.Younger, but still, me."- In front of him now stood teenager John, the person he had been the most cruel to.Throughout highschool John had dealt with various problems and his solution to it all was pretty much, well, some questionable choices.He hadn't allowed himself to be good to his own self and that now reflected on the him that was peering down at, well, himself.The teenager didn't really ask too much.He woud just peer down at John and shake is head from side to side before finally speaking a few words in a low, monotone voice."You could've reached out to someone."As soon as that was said, the figure seemingly disappeared and John was once again left alone with his own thoughts.After another couple of hours the door cracked open once again and someone else walked out from it."Hello, John.-"

At this moment the poor man was sobbing, hands against his hand and even slightly rocking his body back and forth."T-This has to be a dream.. a really bad one."- He noted before looking down and back up at who stood there, smiling, right in front of him.It was another John, however a seemingly old one, probably on his college years."I'm glad you managed to overcome those feelings of guilt..- It wasn't your fault."Those words sent a deep, lightning fast shiver down John's spine and, once again, after professing those words, the figure disappeared.Another couple of hours passed and, as if by sacred ritual, the door opened once more."Let me guess, it's me..-" John blurted out sarcastically.And indeed, as precise as clockwork, John came out again!However, it was his college self, once again.The figure smiled and simply nodded his head a few couple of times before leaning forward and placing his hands on John's shoulder.- "I'm glad you didn't jump.-"

And with that, the figure disappeared once more.Finally, John got up and walked towards the door.He had had enough of that attrocity.Was it divine punishment?Perhaps, but only that way could he either ascend or descend.Once he got close enough to the door, the man grabbed the knot and twisted it open.Inside, only a mirror which reflected his own self.John sighed and closed his eyes.When he opened them back up-- Heaven.&#x200B;
