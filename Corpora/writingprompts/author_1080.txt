"Well I'll be damned....." Captain Aldo whistled softly as his team approached the abandoned vehicle.He had seen the images from the Mars rover but did not truly believe it until now.The machine bore the symbol of Communist Russia, standing alone in defiance of a world which destroyed all life.It would seem, he would not actually go down in history as the first man on Mars."Kinda spooky if you ask me."Johannes muttered under her breath as she looked inside."According to our satellite images their spacecraft was left over 60 miles to the west of here.So where the hell did the cosmonauts go?Why did they keep all this secret even years after the cold war?"It was decided that they would not alert the Russians of the fact that they had discovered their presence on Mars.Naturally, they announced to the world their mission to put a man on Mars but the Russia government never said a word.After all, a world is a big place to hide."That is what we are here to find out, the vehicle isn't the only thing our rover found here."Their Captain walked about 20 yards from the vehicle then began to stomp the ground.He was soon rewarded by a metal clang, a trap door covered from years of storms.The rover was not capable of opening the door, this was the real reason his team was sent.It took the entire team to open it, once they wiped off the dust, the found foreign markings across it's surface.The inside was dark with the exception of a single low light which let out a soft hum.Below, they found the missing cosmonauts.Unfortunately, they had all died a long time ago."Welcome back creators."A voice sounded in the dark.Aldo jumped and Martinez let out a shriek."It has been 36 years and thirty-two days since the last creators arrived."The computer voice did not seem to take notice of their uneasiness and continued speaking."I am pleased to report that there have been no incidents since the last report.Although there has been no further communication from the creator fleet, Project Godmaker is still running as scheduled."There was a silence, the computer seemed to be waiting for something.Hesitantly, Aldo finally spoke in a shaky voice."You......were made by the Soviet's?""Searching..............negative.This unit was not made by the creators who last visited known as Soviet's.This unit is property of the Creator fleet special project and research division.Please provide authentication code."Aldo looked closer now at the computer, the rest of the room was dark but the computer gave enough light to see everything else.It had multiple screens, all running the current events of what was happening back on earth.Some of which were news but others were views from cameras that merely showed street corners and mundane activities."Please provide authentication code."The computer stated once again.There wasn't any change in the way the computer sounded but Aldo almost imagined he heard a slightly impatient tone."What are you-" Aldo was cut off as the trap door swung closed, red lights began to blink and a siren wailed.Johannes ran to the door and tried to open."It's sealed captain!"She shouted with heavy breaths as she pounded against it."ERROR."The computer responded in a booming voice."ERROR, authentication not provided.According to protocol 67 of Project Godmaker, test subjects must not become aware of outside presence.All systems will go offline until intruder presence has been eliminated.Filing second report with Creator Fleet for cleanup."Then it went dark.Edit: Referring to modern Russia as Soviet's
