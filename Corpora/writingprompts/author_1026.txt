"So they just kind of show up?No matter where you are?""That's what I said, isn't it?"I didn't mean to sound so bitchy, but I can't help it.I'm just so got damn irritated and this dimwit asking about Oreos at a time like this was not helping.Not that I could actually stay mad at the kid for very long.That was everybody's reaction.It was a waste of energy to even bother getting mad about anymore.&#x200B;
