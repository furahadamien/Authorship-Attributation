I sit at my desk and stare at the envelope before me, elbows on the surface as head rests atop woven fingers.Where a name or a recipient address would be written, there is instead a symbol I know well - half a heart's outline, and half a keyhole's outline, in the shape of a warped open doorway.Which means, beyond any doubt, that this is from the masked man.And thus I should think carefully all the precedent events, as the implications were bigger than just myself.Originally, none of this had anything to do with me.Starting when I was about 6 years old, I nearly never remembered my dreams.While I could tell that time had passed, there was nothing that had filled the time I was out - in my head, I would simply fall asleep and wake up a moment later feeling rested.From this arose a curiosity in dreams and all manner of sleep-time occurrences.At 18, I began to attend college for the first time.It was scary and a lonely world for me, but due to the time I was born, I found solace in the internet, role-playing as a man in a mask.I began to form a long-distance relationship with a lady, and we would talk at all hours possible of every day.This was a person who seemed ideal in every way to me, worth covering the distance of half a continent between us, one day.As the relationship progressed, I would make sure to ask her about what dreams she had each morning.Some were grand in scale, fighting alongside special ops forces to combat a terrorist who was slowly unleashing 128 bio-weapons on the public.Some were deeply meaningful, standing together on a wall of beautiful graffiti until we fall into a lake made by rain, gazing up through graffiti-colored waters at an unchanged city scape.But most commonly her dreams strung together into a continuing story where she and I lived in an almost make-believe forest world and lived life together.Over time, the narrative grew to include a copy of her and a copy of myself - different, black and white people, but also very similar to ourselves.My copy wore a big brown duster and a large white mask like my internet persona, so you couldn't see him except from the back.But underneath, he was physically a look-alike, and socially he was a quiet version of myself.Her copy never wore glasses, and always seemed to be a refinement of a part of her personality - serious, cutesy, sadness.One night was a change from the expected norm - we had the Skype video call open as she had just fallen asleep, and I watched over her for a few minutes before joining her.As was habit, I asked if Carrie (a pet name) was still awake.She responded, "yes," which was unlike the expected 'no' or silence I was accustomed to receiving.We had a short sleep-talk conversation, which ended with an expression of my enjoyment and desire to do so again.More sleep-talking conversations happen and she becomes more active in these conversations when asleep.About a week after the first, I mentioned in passing the conversations when she was awake, and she became very scared.I was waking up something that had been asleep for many years, since she had seen therapists and psychiatrists as a little girl.But I convinced her that everything was okay, and not to worry.That night, during the sleep talk, her sleeping self revealed herself to actually be her copy, and not actually Carrie.This made sense - the sleep talking version was always some subset of the waking personality - if it was offsetting.To make the distinction, we decided to call copy by Carrie's actual name, Caren.Caren told me about how she had been with Carrie since around the time Carrie was born, just like the masked man (we named Mask) had been with me since I was little.That when I slept, I and Mask would join her in her head.As proof, she offered knowledge of things I had never shown nor told - a birthmark on my right kneecap, that Mask's mask material would change to random things.It was a big day, one that seemed to expand my world.Then Carrie's dreams turned dark.A malevolent being, like a shadow but made hard like cold glass, began corrupting Carrie's dreams.It would do awful things to her, and we were powerless to fight back.In a tale for another time, we once ran with her away fron the shadow man, and at the cost of my life and Mask's, we got Carrie onto a boat with Caren and out to safety in the middle of the waters.It was a long process for her to find my drowned, butchered body in the lake and to stitch me together, but by a miracle I was brought back to life when all patched up.Carrie's real life suffered as well.Depression, anxiety, OCD, school life became opressive and very difficult.She talked less and less.Real life piled on the hardships as well, with dad going blind and mom having a medical emergency.And I was a stress as well, as I made her feel inadequate every day, refusing to live with her, always saying "later" to her.Eventually, when we turned 21, she turned heavily to alcohal, and I did stupid things, and the relationship broke off.And then I had my own dreams.Small things happened, just doing homework or sitting on the bus going to see a friend at his house.But I **had** dreams again.And in each of these dreams, I would see Mask, looking forlorn.Every single one I had, he was there.In one dream where the opportunity presented itself, I confronted Mask.Why was he here?Where had he come from?Was he stealing my dreams peviously?The background faded, then refocused as my house.Through pen-on-paper wordless cartoons, body language, and miming, he conveyed to me that he was unsure why he was here and that he didn't know where to go or what to do.So, somewhat sulkily, I told him he could at least do something to pay for *his* stay in *my* head, since he had already taken so much out of it.That was the last dream I can remember, from about a month ago.Today, on my computer desk, an envalope was placed there with care.And inside is an inky-black fragment or shard of something sharp and cold, not unlike glass.I don't know what this is, or what to do about it, but one of my old friends from that chatroom... Maybe, this isn't the end of my tale with Carrie...
