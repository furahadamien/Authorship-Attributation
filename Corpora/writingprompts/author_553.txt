After a long day at work Jobe just wanted to go home to his family.The near collapse of the Brunswick account had left him feeling like he had been run through the wringer.Despite the total fiasco going on in the office he had managed to singlehandedly hold everything together and even made the time to dip out at lunch to see his daughter play her violin in the spring recital.He was out of the office at 6 and home by 7 just in time to bath his kids, hear about their day and read them a bedtime story.By the time this was done and he had eaten and spent some quality time with his wife it was already 10pm, almost time to go to bed and do it all again.After the day he had had Jobe decided to take a little time to himself to try and relax a little in order to be ready for tomorrow.He knew it wasnt good for him but he sometimes liked to have a cup of coffee before bed to help unwind.As he headed for the kitchen he reflected on the experiences of the day and what a strange day it had been.Many people had not turned up for work that day and he had overhead many extremely agitated phone calls.The explanation he had been given was that suddenly all the worlds greatest dad mugs had started showing the real ranks of their respective owners.The whole thing was preposterous and he had ended up carrying the workload of many of his colleagues that day while they dealt with the fallout of this imaginary issue.Jobe was a nice guy and was always up for a joke but he felt like they had taken it too far this time, it had nearly cost them one of their most profitable accounts.As he reached up to open the cupboard for his mug a tiny part of him wondered what he would find there.While the whole idea was insane his co-workers had been so dedicated to the joke he couldnt help but wonder if it could be true.He pulled his mug down from the shelf his heart began to race a little.He was a good father wasnt he?As the mug came in to view he stopped and stared at it.It was the same mug it had always been, Worlds #1 Dad.He felt stupid, he thought he had been immune but a part of him had believed it might have shown something else.He finished his coffee and as he was heading to bed he was looking forward to tomorrow when things would be back to normal.Jobe hated april fools day.
