I sat, listening as these... *sex workers*... tried to have a conversation like *normal* human beings, giggling to myself and my ingenuity."This is a little dehumanizing, isn't it?"Craig asked, arms folded.He always provided such droll perspectives on our little excursions."Oh, it's more than a little," I said."Look at them, they think they're people.""They are people.""You know what I mean.Middle class people.With respectable jobs.Careers.Lives.Security.Maybe families.Reasons to live.It's ever so delightful to listen to their mimicry.""You really are an asshole."Craig wasn't wrong."Why do you do this kind of thing?""I'm a rich sociopath who treats my social inferiors like playthings for my amusement."I was honest.Deception was for people who had to strive for things, who knew struggle.I knew only idle disdain.To be quite honest, I felt as distant and removed from Craig as I did the prostitutes I'd hired.There was no point of common connection.Not to him.Not even to the other idle rich.Craig looked disgusted.Good.The more of these little 'experiments' I exposed him to, the more I would understand the human condition.I wondered if I could get him to kill someone.I wondered what it would be like to strangle my only friend in the world with my bare hands.Then the soup arrived, and I turned my attention back to my playthings.I wonder... if I'd been born in less exalted circumstances, would I have developed some sense of morality?I like to think so.That I could have been a good person.
