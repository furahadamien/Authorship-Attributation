"Hey Mahk, it's Ben.... yeah... uh-huh.I'm on my way."Ben Affleck hopped in his cah and drove to Mark Wahlburgs house.Rob Gronkowski of the New England Patriots was already there."I am Gronk."The lumbering giant exclaimed when Ben arrived."Oh, hi Mahk."Ben said incredulously upon his arrival.Mark Wahlburg stood up and said "The chouncil of bhoston has been challed to ahction.Our most beloved soldier has been kidnhapped.""I AM GRONK!"The fully uniformed patriot yelled with tears in his eyes.Ben was too stunned to move a muscle."The ahlien ohverlhords ahre here."Mark continued, pointing to a crude map with a circle and an arrow pointing to it labeled 'Here'.Ben was still motionless, as if a piece of himself were missing."We leahve in the mhorning."Mark's eyes caught Ben's."It'll be okahy Ben.He's Bhoston Stong."The next day the 3 heroes marched on the aliens.The day was long and brutal.Half of the city lay in ruin, but our triumphant gods amongst men made it.Ben still hasn't said a word.A true soldier.Finally face to face with Trunakzar, supreme leader of the alien race our story resumes."Thaht's it T." Mark's eyes had a fire not seen since 'Boogie Nights'."You're time is uhp."Trunkakzar yelled "NO, WHY WONT YOU PESTS DIE ALREADY.WHAT MAKES THIS ONE SO VALUABLE YOU'D GO THROUGH SO MUCH?"His long scaley fingers gestured upwards.Matt Damon is suspended above some elaborate trap from a James Bond movie."You don't ghet it."The emblazoned Mark said."He's Bhoston Strong."The alien leader smiled."It's you that doesn't understand.We got what we came for.The essence of Boston."He held up a strange navy blue vial."Yeah," Mark said calmly "but WE HAVE A GRONK."The six foot seven inch monster broke down the wall with a mighty "I AM GRONK!!!!"He tackles Trunkakzar to the ground.Seeing his other half in danger Ben went quickly into action.He scaled the now destroyed wall, ascending higher and higher until he gets to Damon.On the floor Gronk and Trunkakzar are locked in brutal fisticuffs while Mark Wahlburg is getting in a quick pump."I...I thought I lost" Ben was interrupted "No, you can never lose me."Damon's smile was warm, like a cozy fire on a cold Boston morning.Tears rushed to both their eyes as they embraced.But yknow in a manly way.Gronk ripped the alien in half and everyone lived happily ever after.Go Pats.(Did I do it right?)
