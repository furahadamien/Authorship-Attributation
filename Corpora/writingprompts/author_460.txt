The sun had reached its highest point in the sky.I stumbled out of the doorway from a bar and shouted, 
"Why in the god damn did I listen to that idiot!"I slowly regained my composure as I pulled out my smart phone and opened my banking app."Please don't be real, please don't be real, oh god please don'--" I repeated as the app slowly loaded and I stopped as my balance showed on the screen."Ten Dollars?!"I exclaimed."All I have left to my name is 10 Dollars?!""How am I going to explain to the loan sharks that I spent all of my money buying some stupid star..."

As I said that I pulled out and unfolded the deed from my jacket pocket."Deed to the Kaelthal Star, huh, well I guess I should stay away from the bottle for now...But I wonder, where did that strange elf cosplayer go after she took my money"

After rummaging through one of my ancestor's Google Drive I had finally came across this.Finally, something to explain why a Kaelthalian appeared in front of my door today.We had made contact with the Kaelthalians about 50-70 years ago but their region of space had always been a fractured mess constantly fighting each other.They were about as tall as an Average Human but still taller than me.The only real difference between Humans and Kaelthalians is that they have what I would call "Elf" ears and they don't take to kindly to being called elves either."Now you see my liege.There is no mistake in translation here, you are the owner and rightful King of Kaelthal by Intergalactic, Human, and Kaelthalian Law.The transaction is here in the Imperial records as follows.One Imperial Throne for five hundred thousand American Dollars.It is really quite the simple concept, I do not know why you had to dig through his royal highness, your progenitor's personal memoirs to determine this."Frilys said with a smug and triumphant complexion."What I don't really understand is why you guys were selling the whole throne along with the star, was it like some buy one get one free event?I mean clearly my great grandpappy Kevin was drunk and thought he was buying just the star.But not only this but how come I'm the person the Kaelthalian's named their king, er Emperor, and not my mom or dad?"I asked Frilys

"Well your excellency, the star and the throne are one in the same, meaning the one who owns the star is the true ruler of the Kaelthalian Empire.However, we were not always an Empire.Originally, we were a republic, but it was determined that we would become a constitutional monarchy by the Congress of Kaelthal, and our Kings would be the ones to bring us out of our great economic depression and, so they sent envoys out to look for possible candidates.Which leads us to the sale of the Kaelthal Star to Kevin of House Ingol and thus the Ingol Dynasty was founded with Kevin I as Emperor of Kaelthal.This action, did not go as well as those congressmen had hoped.When the people had learned that they would be subservient to a mere human they took to the streets and the congress was dismantled by Gynth the conqueror and he assumed power as what you humans would deem dictator.Under his leadership we would conquer star after star to pave our way to remove this line of claimants to our throne.After Gynth's death our people fell into disarray and after 200 years of anarchy and civil war the Kaelthalian Empire was re-established with you my liege as its Emperor."Frilys replied in the tone of a kindergarten teacher scolding a child not to eat wood chips.I nodded to simulate my understanding of whatever the elf in front of me had just said.But I'm going to be completely honest here.I stopped listening after he said the star and throne are the same.His accent is thick enough to the point that I think its along the lines of a retarded frenchman mocking a scotsman.But to my own credit I tuned back in around the part where Frilys said the Empire was re-established."So, you Kaelthians just decided that I'm the new emperor because someone related to me from 200 years ago bought your star?""Yes didn't I just finish explaining that?"Frilys snorted back at me."Now then my liege our shuttle to the Imperial Capital, Kaelyndas leaves in...," He pauses to check his watch, but I don't recognize the characters, "It leaves in about 6 hours so if you could please tell our staff what you want to do with your... current accommodations.""Is there some sort of way you could just take the whole house and we could sort through it later or something?"I lazily reply back only to wake up as I realize what he had just said."Yes I believe we could do that although-" Frilys quickly responded but I cut him off before he finished."WAIT A SECOND!Did you say I had 6 hours to leave!?""Yes, that is in fact what I have just stated how perceptive of you my liege.That is the official departure date we have set with your United Nations of Humanity in this district of Earth.Of course, we can leave as early as you desire.""Its not about leaving early!Isn't that a little bit too soon?I mean what if I don't get any internet at this ... erm Imperial Capital!I have very important things to do!"Such as watching next week's episode of Planetary Remodelers, but l'm not about to tell them its about my holovision habits."If youre wondering about connection to the Intergalactic Web then we already have the fastest rates in the Palace that we could buy."Frylis said as he rolled his eyes as if knowing why I feigned being busy."Now if there are no more delays, if you would follow me we will board our shuttle and begin the journey to Kaelyndas."Frylis then began to walk towards the Los Angeles Intergalactic Hanger."Well I guess there is no real reason not to inspect my new holdings..." I say aloud mostly to myself because it has dawned on me.I'm the Emperor or High King or whatever of the Kaelthians!All thanks to some guy that is vaguely related to me 200 years ago!Fate is smiling on me for once!I can live high and mighty in a palace surrounded by maids, butlers, and guards!Or so I thought.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The grammar might be pretty bad and there is just a block of text

But it's my first WP so please tell me what to improve on!
