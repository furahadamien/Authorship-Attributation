Dwarves drink.It's what they do, they've always done it, and it's their destiny to continue doing so.But because of the endless drinking, dwarf history has been lost.Asbjrn is a quite normal dwarf.He loved drinking, he loved play fighting, and he loved hanging out with his friends.Usually he's up by 8, going right out to drink and eat with all his friends.But today is not usually, he wakes up, and looks at the clockwork hanging on the wall.It's already 3 in the afternoon "I must have been drinking a lot yesterday."Asbjrn thinks to himself.He walks out and buys some bread to eat, then he goes straight home with a horrific hangover.He goes to bed.Waking up he doesn't have a headache, but he's not drunk, a state he has never been in before."This is weird."Asbjrn thinks aloud.He walks out in the open, it looks to be evening, and everyone is so drunk that they have a hard time walking.Asbrn marches across the street, happier than ever.He feels light, and he never wants it to stop.So he decides to stop drinking alcohol.When Asbjrn awakes next morning, he's surprised.He can actually remember what has happened.He can remember what happened last night.He immediately runs up to the king, first excusing that he didn't work yesterday, then telling the king about his new discovery.The king isn't pleased, he sips from his wine glass, and puts his weight forward to face Asbjrn."We will keep drinking!"He says," and I'll never command my people to stop drinking, it will be their own choice."So the next day Asbjrn wakes early to make sure he can find his friends before they start drinking.He's lucky, he sees them right before they walk into a pub.He tells them about his discoveries, but they laugh at him too.Seems like Asbjrn has to work harder if he wants the dwarves to stop.(English is not my first language, please tell me if there's anything that needs fixing.)
