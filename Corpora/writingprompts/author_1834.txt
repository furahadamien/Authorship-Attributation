WickTheTrickster
I lean back against the wall of my cell in confusion, my mind blank with bewilderment.As a lucky man myself, I know a coincidence when I see it, and this is most certainly not.Am I not the only one who could see other's luck rating?That would be the logical conclusion, seeing all these people blessed by fortune, sharing the same binds as one another.However, where does that conclusion leave me?Why would someone actively be imprissoning the worlds luckiests men and women in one prison?Besides, I still don't even know why I'm here in the first place.One moment, I was enjoying my gifts at a cassino in Utah, on my way to Vegas, and then I'm beimg escourted into a van by armed guards.This was far from a fortunate happenstance, obviously.Perhaps I could escape these walls, but by what means?I can't dwell on these thoughts for long, though, as I am soon taken out of my temporary holding cell and into my permanent home.As I pass by, my eyes widened as I witnesed what this prison had to offer.Instead of an oppressive cage built for the filth of society, it resembles more of a hotel.I pass by game rooms and swimming pools, all with the prisoners smiling and at peace.Further down the hall, I catch the inviting smell of fresh cakes and other sweets, which I figure originates from the cafeteria.While these tantalizing perks of the prison catch my eye, in only further tangles the yarn ball that was once  my train of thought.This place wasn't a proper prison, so why am I being kept here?!Days pass, and I begin to see how things work down here.All prisoners are assigned a job, and in my case, I had gotten tasked with preparing food for the cooks, which to no one's surprise, was quite fortunate for me.After all, it's a job I've had before, and hardly stressful for me.For doing my job, I do get paid, and am allowed to spend my funds on various arcade machines in the game room, swim time, courtyard time, so on and so forth.Even without working I am guranteed 3 warm meals a day, which are filling and positivily delicious.No one could complain about being here, it's a utopia!No one, except me.The life of luxury will not be enough the calm my curious mind, or distract me from the very reason I was put here, or rather the lack their of.Perhaps it's not a wish to be free, but simply to know the truth, wherever that path leads me.My plans have already hit a roadblock before they began, however.It took me only a week to notice the pattern everything follows.The prisoners are woken up at 7 AM on the dot, daily, and we are required to verify our person at the door by checking our fingerprints, only after are we allowed out of the cell.Metal detectors lie just outside of everyone's cells, making sure no one brings contraband in or out of their cells to begin with.Roll call begins after, with searches on everyone's cells taking place during that time, as well as maintanance on the detectors.After which, everyone's esquorted to their jobs, and after that, we're given free reign to roam the halls, but always under constant supervision.Why is it that security is so tight, when the prison itself is rather lax?Only then does realiziation hit me like a piano attop a cartoon character's head.Nothing here is left to chance.Absolutly nothing.If I'm to escape, I'll need far more then luck.
