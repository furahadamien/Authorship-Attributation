The date is May 25th, 2094.The day had begun like any other; picking myself up from a drunken stupor, peeling myself up from the floor I called my bed for the night.Stemming the nosebleeds I have been suffering from pretty much since the war ended.I look out on the sky, hazy and unclear as the month all of the bombs fell, the days when we all felt so small, while others in countries far away were subjected to radiation and certain death.We as a people had to come together, had to fight the tyrranical forces of a country long thought of as the leaders of the free world.I still remember it like it was yesterday.While the commonwealth and the rest of the world worked to rebuild itself in the last 49 years 364 days, America was coming into the fold in just hours.Would they realise?Would they see the truth?Would they find out that they had been partitioned away from the rest of the world?We had devised new communication methods to retain the facade we had created, the lie that we were all going our own way...not entirely a lie, more a false truth, we had gone our own way but just away from the USA, we as the rest of the world remained together.May 26th 2094

We had expected to hear from the US by now, but nothing, not even a murmur.We had sent a drone to investigate, but upon entering American airspace, everything went fuzzy and that is the last we have heard from the drone, that and an extraordinary radiation reading.What happened?
