"Come on, Odin, it's a *Spatula!*"

"Well, he *did* kill 3 people with it.""By spreading antibiotic resistant *e.coli*.""I mean, Jensbjordnik The Great II threw a bunch of smallpox corpses into a castle with a trebuchet that one time...and that counted"

"Yeah..." said Jensbjordnik The Great II "...That *was* pretty cool.""But a trebuchet is a weapon!""And a spatula isn't?""Tell you what-" said Odin "Njord here will go to the Earth, *armed with only a spatula*, and, over the course of 1 hour, attempt to wage war with it.We shall see then, if it is truly a weapon.""Very well.In one hour, we shall see."Shortly before noon, what appeared to be a tall, blonde, and relatively attractive man walked into a library and checked out a civics textbook.One hour later, United States President Donald J. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Speaker of the house ~~John Boehner~~ Paul Ryan, and numerous other minor politicians, had all died of spatula-induced wounds to the head, and the USA, now in a power vacuum, was teetering on the edge of civil war.&nbsp;

EDIT: Apparently I Googled "current speaker of the house" wrong.
