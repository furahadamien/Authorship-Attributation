All I knew throughout my life were two things: poker and prison.Poker was kind to me and poker was cruel.Prison was just mainly cruel.I met my wife in Vegas after I won a high stakes Texas Hold Em bout.I met my daughter through the thick, plated glass in the state penitentiary.Those two momentsthose two people changed me more than any other ever could.But two things remained.Poker and prison._____________________________________________

As I folded my hand for the fifth time, Death seemed to be enjoying himself.Was he Death?I dont know.Seemed like an okay guy.Maybe I jumped to conclusions to quickly.He reeked of death, but that son-of-a-bitch knew how to play poker.We sat in an empty casino.Nothing was outside and all the lights were off, but it wasnt dark.The outside was more empty than the inside though.Not black, just *nothing*.Like what your eyes see in the blind spot.What your eyes see in the back of your head.Nothin.Not sure how long Id been There, but it felt like a while.Wed only played 10 hands but it felt like years, maybe decades.I tried to ask him how long or why we were There, but he had a pretty good poker face and a mouth that didnt move for anything but his cigar.Very mysterious guy.Short and stubby fella.If hed had a nationality, I bet itd be Italian.How do you say death in Italian?Morte, I think.Eventually we reached what mustve been our 40th or so round and he finally finished his cigar.He tossed the last bit aside and as it went through the floor, He took off his sunglasses and stood up, folding his hand.Lucky for me he didnt know I had nothing but a high card of 8.Nonetheless I was relieved we were done playing.I didnt care much for poker at that point.He had eyes of steel as he explained to mine what was happening.Heat death of the universe.All life in all galaxies vanished, as did every atom to ever exist.Every proton and every quark.Every plant and every animal.Every Ace and every king.Either I had been There a lot longer than expected, or the heat death of the universe happened a lot sooner than we all expected.Global warming, maybe?Mr. Morte went on to explain that God was fair.Therefore, at the end of time he gave us all a fair and speedy trial in front of a jury of our peers to determine our place through eternity.The peers werent randomly selected, though.I had experience being in front of juries, had a lot of experience in prison too so that should tell you something about my experiences with juries.Maybe this would be my lucky break.4 jurors: the person Ive hurt the most, the person Ive made the happiest, the person whose life ended through my actions, and the person whose life continued from my actions.Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.I was a fairly good guy.Donated lots of my winnings to charity, spent a lot of time playing poker in my garage with a homeless guy that stayed around the curb, picked up trash in parks.Nobody is without their flaws though.Committed tax evasion more times than I shouldve, threatened several bartenders lives, not to mention I spent 25 years after Mary was born in a prison.I got to see her for the six months I was out though.The jurors came one at a time, at the time their lives were most effected by my actions.The first juror was my wife.Shocker.She screamed and cussed in my face.She was the one Id cost the most pain.I knew what shed said, but I didnt listen.It was a lost cause.I loved that woman with all of my heart and she despised me.I couldnt blame her, but that doesnt mean it was all my fault.She had a drinking problem, so Id go play poker and bring Mary with me.Id leave her in the car with the A/C and radio on.Had an extra set of keys so I could keep the car running and the doors locked, with the car in view.There was parking lot security.I wasnt perfect, but I didnt want her growing up playing poker, and I wanted her to be safe.My wife left and Mr. Morte did not seem impressed with me.But as coach B always said, on to the next one.Juror number two was Nate, the homeless guy I played poker with.He told me I was the only person to ever show him love in his long and fulfilling life.After I died, he went on to get ordained, he even officiated my funeral.He got his pilots license and traveled the world.He spread the message of Christ through a little game called poker.Nate loved me.Mr Morte still seemed skeptical.On to the next one.The third juror was the persons life I saved.I wasnt surprised when my baby Mary showed up.She couldnt speak.Just an infant.I saved her from her mothers drunk driving incident.She ran a red light and had a driver hit the rear passenger side.Mary wouldve been sitting there had I not grabbed her and left when her mother wasnt looking.I stayed with her at the pub and put her in the back seat of my car.I knew shed be safe there.I went inside to finish my game of poker.Spent a few hours there to stay away from drunken love of my life.While at the pub, I decided to get a stuffed bear from the claw machine for Mary.I reached into my pocket to pull out some spare change.You can picture my horror when I realized I had both sets of car keys.When I got to the car it was too late.A car in the summertime is pretty hot after 3 hours.We buried her and my wife couldnt stomach me.It wasnt the child neglect that gave me 25 in the pen.My wife came at me with a knife 3 days after the funeral, and I put 3 rounds in her.Didnt kill her thankfully.But I still held a lot of hate in my heart.Had it not been for her drunken behavior, I wouldnt have been put in that situation.They wrote it off as attempted murder rather than self defense.I spent 25 of 30 behind bars.Drifted away in my sleep before the last five.So it came as no surprise when the fourth juror, the one whose life I wasted, was also Mary.What did surprise me, was that it wasnt the Mary I knew.This was a grown woman.It was Mary if she had lived past that day.She held no hate for me.She was a successful salesperson at a local insurance agency.She said that things were going to look better.Had she survived that, Id have divorced her mom and moved her to Massachusetts.Id be a fisherman, done with the gambling and tax fraud.Wed live happily ever after.I shouldnt feel guilty, she said.Guilt finds its way to you after you realize you prevented something really beautiful.Mr Morte left and returned in what couldve been forever or no time at all.He said he spoke with the Big Guy.No place for me up There.No place for be down below.The good and the bad were pretty evenly matched.He said I can pick anywhere on earth to spend my eternity.Well I only knew two things, poker and prison.Pretty easy choice between the two.Three hots and a cot is as nice as it sounds.Mary didnt want me playing poker anymore.
