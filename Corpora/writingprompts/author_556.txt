Shit, Larry muttered.Its changing. The graphics on the white mug before him had blurred, the black #1 Dad text going light, then lighter still before they faded completely.After a couple of seconds the text was gone.Whats the verdict? his father-in-law asked, more concern in his voice than the usual condescension.He stood and bent over the table trying to see anything that had emerged.Fred had softened in the year since his daughters passing.He was still a cold man, but there were moments.Moments when he remembered Larry had been dealt a shit card and was trying his best to emerge a winner for his kids.At times, Larry tried to tell himself that the chill he often felt from the man had more to do with the daughter he lost then the son-in-law that remained.Sometimes he even believed it.Anything coming through?

Nothing yet. Larry set the mug on the kitchen table and leaned over, resting his chin on his hands.Both sides of the mug shimmered, its assessments not yet registering.Fred hunched over on his elbows.Larry its not an exact science.The Agency will take that into account.This technology is in its infancy.Everyone knows that.

Larry looked over to him.I appreciate that Fred, but Im not sure a government that assesses your ability to parent through these mugs is a government body Im going to put a whole lot of trust in to make the best decision for my kids.

Fred stood and went to the sink.He stood there a moment looking out the back window.Beyond, Larry knew his kids were in the back yard.He could hear the springs of the trampoline, the shrieks of laughter he knew only came from the older James double-bouncing the younger Timmy.At 11 and nine the boys were perfect ages.Neither had grown into a supreme asshole as they would once they approached their teenage years, but the childish challenges young kids were prone to were behind them.Larry couldnt imagine two more perfect kids.Fred turned.Do you have your affairs in order?I hate to even ask Larry.

I do, yes.

And everything is signed?

Yes.I signed it all last month before the mugs were issued.

And the number is, what?800 million? 

I guess, Larry said shrugging.They estimate that puts you in the top half of dads worldwide.If you fall below that the Agency gets involved.They take the kids.

Jesus, Fred muttered.The news said the range of 400 million to 800 million usually results in counseling.So thats a silver lining or so they say. Larry rubbed his eyes, pulling his hands along the frame of his face.He stroked his chin.Above 400 youre in good shape.But if youre below that 800 Larry trailed off, choking up.He turned the cup searching for some sign of a number appearing.Seeing none, he put his head in his hands.Hed tried so hard in the last year.His efforts to be there for his sons had consumed everything.His time, his energy, his money.Everything.His job had been threatened more than once as he skipped important meetings to ensure he was on the sidelines of Timmys soccer games.He passed on any new addition to his wardrobe to make sure James had access to the latest trendy apparel ahead of the school year.He slept poorly; both his sons often insisted on sleeping in his bed to ensure they curled up in the spot once occupied by his wife.Hed passed on casual requests for dinner from women interested in seeing if he was ready to date again, promising his boys family dinners would remain unchanged.The last year had been brutal, but every day he closed his eyes confident hed done all he could.He measured the mug before him.Would it feel the same?Fred walked back over.The chair screeched against the hard tile floor as he pulled out the chair next to his son-in-law.Larry, he said, dropping into the chair.Listen to me.

Larry dropped his hands and glanced at his father-in-law.He didnt have much strength left and prayed the old man wouldnt sap what remained.If the mug went the wrong way, he was going to need something left in the tank for the kids.But the old man surprised him.Larry I know I havent always been easy on you.I lost my wife before her time and watched the same thing happen to my only child a year ago.Im a bitter man and I know it.Over the last twelve months youve braced against the weight of the storm at times and Im sorry for that.Instead of giving you shelter I compounded your problems.If I had a mug I know the number coming up wouldnt go in my favor if you catch my drift.But you need to know something, son.You need to know that in between the pile of shit the last year has been for me, and a lot of years before that, watching you with those two boys out there have been the happiest moments for me.Ive watched you nurture them, shield them from a world that could have easily made them harder, angrier, and instead you ensured that their world would keep spinning normally.You deserve a wonderful life.And you deserve to keep those wonderful kids in that life.Mark my words if for some reason something other than a #1 shows back up on that mug, you have my word that Ill spend any breath I have left in my lungs making sure that grave error is corrected.So help me God.

Larry looked at the man in front of him.Freds jaw was clenched and his lip trembled.Larry knew he was as serious as hed ever seen him.He reached out and grabbed the mans hand.He softly muttered a thank you, giving his father-in-laws hand a squeeze.Freds eyes shifted quickly.Its changing, son.

Through his tears Larry looked at the mug before him.The softest variance between the white cup and a an emerging graphic had become visible.He almost grabbed the cup, but realized he wasnt sure if that would disrupt the process.Suddenly Larry grew calm.He realized hed earned whatever number was about to change his life.Everything he had, hed poured into his children.Not just since the mug had been issued.Not just since the death of his wife.But since the day they were born.He realized Fred had been right.Hed always been a top father to anyone whod ever paid any attention.While that might not matter to the Agency, it mattered to him.If the outcome wasnt how he felt it should be hed pour all his energy into fighting the system.Slowly before him, the graphic on the cup took shape.Fighting his initial instinct to the contrary he grabbed the mug.He pulled it to him.The graphic continued to 
The outline was clear.Larry smiled.Tears welled in his eyes.He blinked them back and stared at the number before him.He choked up.He checked once last time before he put the mug down on the table and cried.And for the first time in a year he did so out of happiness.Life had finally decided to balance the scales in his favor.After a moment he lifted his head and dried his eyes.He stood and hugged Fred, who he could see had also been weeping.Then he took a deep breath and headed toward the door to spend the rest of the afternoon with his kids and his father-in-law, knowing that while he now knew he had plenty more afternoons with them in his future, today was one he was going to treasure forever.
