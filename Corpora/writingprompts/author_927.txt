deathtamer
As a kid, I was always fathomed with the idea of immortality, being immortal... Eternal.Then this devil popped up on my radar and offered me a chance never before seen, and will never be in the centuries that follow.Ahh, immortality, that's the thing, dreams of a child, come true decades later, with the help of state of the art facilities."Hey kiddo, how goes your research?""Well, you're right on time, I've discovered how to splice immortal genes that slow down bodily functions such as aging and prevent deterioration of internal organs at an impossibly slow pace, the aging process would probably slow down till I'll barely age a year in a millenia.""Yeah, what are you gonna do with the formula?""I'm not thinking of giving it to anyone, at least not yet, besides my wife... We'll have eternity to spend together"

"Ain't that good news, lucky for you!""I sense a hint of sarcasm in that tone of yours, what's up?I might be a scientist but I'm not the supremely genius type that cares not for the world.""Well, you should know right?I'm a devil, devil's do not only bargain with one person.""So... You bargained with another scientist?""DING DING DING!BINGO!!""What did they do?I mean, what's their research?""Well, look outside the window, but my advice is that you should hurry up to your wife before everything's too late.Have fun in hell, hahahhahaha" And with that sentence, he's gone from the room

Well I'm in my house's basement turned bunker/lab, so there's no windows per se, although I did install some CCTV cameras around the perimeter of my house.There are figures at the gate and more are shambling towards it.I realized what they are... 

Zombies...
