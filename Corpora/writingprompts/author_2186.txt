Marlamin Silverkin, necromancer, DM: OK, back to you "Keith".Chonzak, goblin king: Right.So, how long will finishing that deck going to take again?Marlamin: Throw for Dexterity, add a bonus if you have the Carpentry skill and anything for tools.Chonzak: I get a... 4.High Priestest Uhisca of the Elven Kingdom of the Shadow Forrest: Dude... fuck!Marlamin: Hmm... about 3 weekends

Throlkaer, Chieftain of the Possum Clan: Brutal!Chonzak: You know what, screw this, I am done... with this drill.I am not going anywhere with this so I'm going to the hardware merchant to get a new one.Marlamin: Fine.The drive to the hardware store is uneventful.You enter the store and find a clerk.He's a young, white male human in his 20s, average height, red hair, speaks with a bit of a lisp.Uhisca: Human stores have clerics?Throlkaer: Clerks.You said clerks, right?Malarmin: Right.Throlkaer:  Pay attention.Uhisca: Sorry...

Malarmin: Guys, please... Chonzak.I mean, "Keith".Chonzak: I'll ask the clerk for a new, custom-made drill, made for high potency drilling.Malarmin: Uh...The clerk answers "I'm not sure we can do that.What are you working on exactly?"Chonzak: Look, it's this *sigh*, it's this cheap drill I got, man, it's just a low rating.I mean, it's too slow.Malarmin: The clerk replies "Show me what you have."Chonzak: I show him.It's called the "Mastercraft".I'll exchange it for any other model that has a better rating.Can I barter?Malarmin: That's not how suburban human merchants work.You can throw to see if you can get a refund for your current drill, though.Chonzak: Why wouldn't I get a refund?What would I do with two swords?What would I do with two drills?Come on!Malarmin: Dem's the rules, Chonzie...

Chonzak: Hrmmm... Fine.Oh, 19!Malarmin: Great!You have the receipt, you can exchange "Mastercraft" for a drill called "Bosch" for an extra 300 gold.Err, dollars.Chonzak: Done!Malarmin: Put it on your sheet.Since your roll was good he throws in a few drill bits for you.Chonzak: Sweet!I sure love me some free drill bits!Everyone: *laughs*

Malarmin: You exit the store and... throw for Perception please.Chonzak: What what?Oh boy, here we go!An 8, I get an 8.Malarmin: You find your car after a few minutes only.Chonzak: Sweet!Malarmin: You unlock your driver door and hear someone yell "Hey Keith!"Uhisca: Random encounter, at last!Chonzak: Who is it?Malarmin: It's Chet, your supervisor from work.Throlkaer: Oh no!Not him again!Chonzak: That's my line, but thanks man.*looking at the DM* Thanks a whole fucking lot for ruining my human weekend.Malarmin: Chet approaches.to be continued
