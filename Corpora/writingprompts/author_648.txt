My back aches.My knees gone funny somehow- I now use a cane to go about my day.Four legs to two legs to three legs.The good ol riddle.But the people around me, all puppy fat and doe eyes, theyve gone the other way.Memories like grains of sand.I doubt theres any thought left in those pretty little heads.Heh.The streets are crowded today.I pass through a crowd of immortals, laughing at thin air.Their heads are thrown back, and I see a gleam of pearly teeth.I knock a few ankles aside with my cane.A couple of them call me stupid.The others, wide-eyed, gasp and cover their mouths.As I pass, I hear the word scattered among peals of childlike laughter.I dont look back.Sometimes, I wonder what wouldve happened if I was two years younger.If I was brave and lionhearted, and stole the serum.If I wouldnt feel these aches.If my friends were around me, laughing and talking again.My cane bumps into the doorstep of my home.We thump out an unsteady rhythm together, the cane and I.The keys are in my right pocket.They jingle as I fish it out.The key is turned, and we limp in.Honey, I call out, waving a wrinkled hand, and a radiant figure turns around from her seat at the dinner table, young and forever beautiful, Im home!
