"I'm getting too old for this shit," grumbling to myself.I hate the idea of getting old.I feel heavy, my joints ache, feet get bloated, I have to watch what I eat, when I eat, where I shit, when I shit.I just want to feel young for once.It pisses me off to no end that I was two years shy of the "miracle" drug known as Emergo.It stopped the aging process creating near immortality.Sure, some dumbass could wipe themselves from the face of the Earth by being stupid and gaining that prestigious Darwin Award, but living forever seems to have its perks.Never age, keeping your strength, strong mental facilities, and having a sex drive like a mollied up coke fiend on viagra.The first year of the drug coming out, entire cities of millenials turned into an impromptu Olympic Village.People performing feats of strength and agility never before seen, then the constant fucking.God, so much fucking.It's how I met my first wife before I started showing the signs of aging.But upon realizing I was part of the lost generation, she went off and found herself another like herself, except the kid was 13 years her junior had she aged normally.So here I am, standing in line like the rest of us old folks, waiting for my pharmaceuticals, when some Emergo asshole drives his truck through the store front.Being a former Army Doctor, I rush over to assess the kid.Kid seems like he's in a daze."Kid!Hey Kid!You alright?Do you know where you are?"The kid looks at me dumbfounded."Alright, how many fingers am I holding up?"Kid shrugs his shoulders."What, did you suddenly forget how to count or something?"Aww damnit, he's got a concussion.Told you, limited immortality and all that shit.I pick up my phone and call 9\-1\-1."9\-1\-1 what's your emergency?Hehehe, eeeeeemerrrrgency.""I got a kid here who just drove his truck through the store.He seems to have a concussion of some sort and needs medical attention, can you send over an ambulance?""An ambu\-.. Ambulance?Uhhhhhh, heheheh, sure."The fuck is going on?Just then I see a fire truck plow through the parking lot, wrecking the fucker and destroying tons of cars.What the hell?Just then I get an alert on my phone.*CDC Special Report: After conducting thorough autopsies of various recently deceased Emergo drug recipients, it has been discovered that significant deterioration of the brain occurs over time, eventually reducing rational thought, reasoning, and higher order thinking to that of a 3 year old.*

I sigh heavily.. Just great, I'm surrounded by morons.
