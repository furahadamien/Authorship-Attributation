I'm not well.At least, that's what I've been told all my life.But this... woman... had *spoken* words that I *heard*.With my *ears*.In *her* voice.My mind raced.If she **was** real, then that meant that I **wasn't** sick.She **had** to be real, here she was in front of me.But what if she **wasn't**?What if my sickness was now at at new level where I now **saw** things?It didn't help my judgement that her voice had been especially loud these past few days, more than usual.Before it had been as if we were in the same room and I could hear her muttering to herself in the corner.But now it was like the distance between us had closed so much it was as if I was in her head.Or that she was in mine.I started to *feel* emotions that weren't mine.When I closed my eyes, I could almost *see* faint images of places where I physically wasn't.Just that morning I could literally *taste* coffee in my cereal while she wondered aloud if she had put too much creamer in.I wanted so desperately to believe that it was all real, to know that I wasn't actually crazy, that it wasn't all just in my head.But at the same time I knew that it could all be a product of my sickness, and that my hope could be false.To be telepathically linked?That has the stuff of soulmate fiction.But even as all this conflict ran through my mind, I dared to reach out with my mind.To call out with this possibly false hope, that maybe... just **maybe**... this was actually something."*are... are you...real?*"

My mind froze as I waited for a response.Almost as if popping a bubble, I could suddenly feel it; her disbelief giving way to excitement.Her hope being affirmed.Outwardly, she had her hands over her mouth with the beginnings of a river forming in the corners of her eyes.She reached out with a hand."*It's really you... oh my god.... it's you!*"

In a daze, I grasped her hand and actually spoke in a tentative voice, still unsure of everything."Yeah... it's me."Her hand, I could actually feel it.The warmth, it's smoothness, the dips of the scars.The scars?I looked down at the hand I was holding, then further up the arm.There were many, faded from age but there none the less.I can *feel* her take notice, along with the flush of embarrassment.I know these.Almost twenty years ago.The screams she had.*You aren't real!You aren't REAL!I'm REAL!I'm the real one!I'm the real one because I can FEEL this!*

She smiles kindly at me, feeling in her own mind how I pieced it together.Instead of pulling back, she steps forward and pulls my shirt collar down a bit, exposing a deep scar of my own at the base of my neck.Only my parents knew about that scar.I hear her thoughts in my head.With some melancholy she repeats the very words I had thought to myself that night."*It'll stop with this.It'll stop.It won't be real after this.*"

The words cut though me, but not in the way that hurt.The dam breaks, and the tears surge forth.We embrace, relishing every sensation it brings."*But I am real, and you didn't stop.*"

"*And I'm real, and you can feel me.*"

For a short while we remain together with no words, only our emotions that cascade over each other.We separate.She wordlessly asks if I want to go to a cafe nearby.I agree in kind.We have so much to think about.Together.
