"You heard that?"asked James, holding his right headphone cup slightly above ear."I think they are at it, again.""Yeah, he is taking it out on stuff."said Eric."I swear one of these days..."


James got up and tiptoed until he could reach the door.Boys were upstairs at their room as usual to avoid any unnecessary contact with him.He slowly rotated the door knob and slightly cracked the door open."Fuck you Mary, after all I have done for them, for this family!"roared the man."Is this how you thank me?!"James could only hear sobs in turn."Fuck this shit, It's enough.I am going ther.." He was startled when Eric put his hand on his shoulder.When did he...?"Let's go together."His brother said, eyes gleaming."It's time."Two young boys, found the courage to face their fears at that moment.James rushed to get his baseball bat while Eric was scrambling to find something heavy.They were flying down the stairs a moment later.That was when a thunderous noise kicked dust particles up from their resting places.Shocked, they stopped dead on the track of their chivalrous charge as if they were crashed into an invisible wall which was fear.Following the hanging and screeching silence, something heavy dropped on the wooden floor.When James entered the kitchen he found mom on her knees.Other than bloodshot eyes, poor woman looked relieved if anything.She was leering at the lifeless husk of a man lying on the kitchen floor.James grabbed the gun from her hand and put it on the table."Mom" he said, "It's okay, here have a seat."While supporting the silent, fragile woman on her way to a chair, James caught a glimpse of Eric kneeling next to the man from the corner of his eye."James" he said."Here, take a look at this."A second later he was next to him and handed a white ceramic shard."What's... Is this the mug he bought for himself?"asked James, puzzled."Yeah, the one which had World's No.1 Dad written on it.""What's wrong with it, why did you give it to me?"asked James turning the piece in his hand."Wait why is this completely blank?"Eric nodded."I think it is the part that should have the word Dad on it."----------------------
