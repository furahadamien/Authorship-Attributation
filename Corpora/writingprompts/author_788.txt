Fyi I flipped the prompt on its head because I thought it was a better fit for my version.Hope people still enjoy my quick attempt at a comedic take on this theme!___
I strode into the impromptu gathering of the Seven Deadly Sins with confidence.Well, not to put too fine a point on it, but I strode in with a fair amount of pride if Im being honest.Being the Aspect of Pride, I was of course quite familiar with the feeling, but I was positively overflowing with myself at the moment.This emergency meeting had been called purely because of me!Well, at least purely because of how humans were choosing to use my name.Pride Month had become all the rage in human society and my fellow aspects of sin were alarmed to see me being celebrated and exalted in such a way.Of course, I knew that the month actually celebrated LGBTQ individuals and the progress that had been made toward sexual and gender equality, but I sure as hell wasnt going to tell them that!I *loved* that they thought I was suddenly being elevated above the rest of them!My lone goal for this gathering was to prevent them from discovering the truth.Our meeting place wasnt a fixed location or even real.We tended to exist outside the bonds of space and time, so technically any of us could create whatever location we desired.Why we agreed on a boring and drab conference room I have no idea, but getting all seven of us to agree on anything was quite a chore so we tended to stick with this incredibly lame motif.Most of my fellow aspects of deadly sin glared at me as I entered.I greeted them each condescendingly as I surveyed the room.Some other aspects of newer or lesser sins sat around the edges of the table, taking notes or refilling coffee.They were the 'interns' of our little organization, working hard in relative obscurity, hoping for a call up to the grown ups table some day.My actual associates, Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, and Envy were already seated around the conference table as I took my place among them.This meeting is called to order, Sloth yawned from the rotating chairman's seat.We are here to discuss the unprecedented development of one of our members being outright celebrated by humanity and the potential ramifications on our ability to fulfill our roles.The floor is now open for debate.

Not surprisingly, Envy was the first to speak up, Pride, my old friend and valued colleague, you know that I am a fan of yours.Truly I am!I feel we often go hand in hand and have done great work leading humans astray together in the past.But do we *reallly* need an entire month celebrating you?I mean, what have youuuu doneeee that I havent done?DO YOU THINK YOURE BETTER THAN ME?

Envy please, you know I cant change the way humans feel, it's explicitly against our rules and bylaws!If they feel naturally inspired in the depths of their souls to celebrate my greatness, who am I to say no? I asked with some degree of feigned smugness.This is such a waste of time, Lust chimed in.Why dont we put all this energy into something more fun?We could transform this room into a seedy hotel and just see where events take us.

For the last time, Lust, we are not turning our annual meeting into an orgy, Sloth said.Your proposal has been voted down countless times in the past, and the sole focus of this discussion is Prides month.

Well, Im not jealous of Prides month at all! a voice piped up from the background.Yeah, it's nothing special!I heard that Pride bribed millions of humans just to get his stupid month! another spouted.Lying, Gossip, please remember that you are not yet official members of this organization.Per our bylaws, please remain silent unless spoken to, Sloth lazily chastised them.Gahhhhhhh!Enough of this nonsense! Wrath shouted as he stood and violently flipped the table.This is BULLSHIT!I am the greatest of all the sins.It is I who have been the downfall of greatest generals and leaders throughout history.If any sin should be celebrated it should be me and me alone!

Wrath ranted and raged for hours on end.Normally we just let him go until he exhausted himself, but this was getting absurd.I finally decided to interject.Wrath, my old frenemy, why does my month of celebration bother you so much?Whats *really* going on?

Without warning the shape and form of our ethereal conference room shifted to resemble a psychologists office.Most of the aspects of sins sighed or grumbled as they stood around the edge of the room, but I was seated on the chair and sure enough Wrath settled in on the therapy couch before he began to speak.Well, my anger probably comes from a place of insecurity, I know that.Im not really one of the fun sins.People just loooove to eat themselves to death, or chase enormous wealth, or get freaky with some new hot guy or gal every night of the week, he said while glancing sheepishly at Gluttony, Greed and Lust as he described the behavior they were responsible for.But me?Humans don't *want* me... Im most often a very undesired arrival or even a side product of the other hip and cool sins.I tend to pop up when they least expect me.Im just...I'm ugly, Im so damn ugly inside and out!

Mmm, mhmm mhmm I see, I muttered.So lets really dig into these feelings youve been having.Just taking a shot in the dark here, but how was your relationship with your parents?

Wrath burst into tears.*Bingo*, I thought to myself with... once again... not a small amount of pride.If Id learned anything from watching human entertainment, it was *always* the parents at the root of things.This wasn't even going to be a challenge.___
