"Oh, come *on!*"

I threw my travelling device hard onto the stony ground before picking it up and clutching it to my chest again."What the hell are you doing here?""Bro, chill!I've been here for like, *decades!* Was wondering when you were gonna turn up.""Well that's just great.I knew it.I **knew** you would do this.You do it every time, Kevin!""Come on, man.That's not fair."I stared at Kevin, my veins pumping as anger coursed through my body.The last person I'd been expecting to meet here was him: the stealer of my ideas for years, the guy who'd ridden my coat tails to glory whenever he could."Bro, why don't you chill and meet some of my knights.They have like, swords and everything!"Kevin gave me that goofy grin, but i was having none of it."How about you tell me how you got to my machine without me knowing first, hmm?I had it secured, and no one knew the workings of it.I was the first to use the bloody thing!"I glared at him, seething."Come on, man.How do you know I didn't find my own way here through my *own* device?"Kevin shrugged and lobbed a lazy look around the courtyard."How do I know?How do *I KNOW?*" I was almost shouting at the incredulity of Kevin's response."Why don't we start with that science fair in fifth grade where we both 'created' that volcano and you did none of the work, except to tell the teachers it was all your idea?Or what about the time I wanted to date that girl at college, and you were my wingman?""Oh yeah, I nailed that.""No, you nailed *her*.You told her I had syphilis after I'd spent an hour getting to know her!""Oh, yeah."Kevin gave a chuckle."And then you dated her for six months!""Sorry about that!""The whole college called me Syphilis Sid for three years!""Bro, it was just a prank.""I'm sure it was," I said, my blood boiling."And let's not forget what *was* the biggest indignity I've suffered until now, when you stole my ideas around time revolutions and presented them to the science board at Harvard to secure your admission.""Bruh, I just *based* my presentation on your ideas, I added my own stuff."Kevin gave a chuckle and rubbed his nose."All that you added was a new font!You presented my breakthrough theory of time travel in Comic Sans MS!*You're a monster!"* I screamed, turning heads all around as people looked at me suspiciously."You need to chill, cuz."Kevin put his arm around my shoulder."Life's too short to get wound up, man.It's like I always say: you get bitter, or you get better.""*I* always say that!"I bellowed, moving to throw Kevin's arm from around me.But then it happened: a quiet revelation - a feeling born out of solitude.I thought of every night I'd spent alone at college because of Kevin; of the teachers who'd told me off for letting him do all the work in the projects we'd done together.Of the years spent on my own as a disgraced scientist in my lab, creating my device so I could go back and stop Kevin from ruining my life.Every moment we'd been together had been a hellish journey of living in the freezing shadow of his lazy, cunning attitude.I hated Kevin so much.But now... now I knew what to do."You kept the spare receiver with you, right?"I whispered, causing Kevin to lean in.I smelt the pickles and ale on his breath."Yeah bruh, round my neck, just like you- I mean, I planned it."He pulled at his undershirt, revealing the small receiver that kept him connected to the future."Well, then."I leaned in to his ear, a grin pulling at my mouth."Here's one more thing I'm doing before you, brother."And as I wrenched the necklace from my twin, I heard fear enter his voice for the first time; a scream that grew as I smashed his necklace with my heel, pulled on my own device, and clicked the RETURN button.As I was pulled back through time, the echoes of my brother's nightmare reached me.He had stolen so much of my past.But I had just sealed his future.&nbsp;
