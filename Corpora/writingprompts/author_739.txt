The Long Happy began almost as soon as I was born.I remember before it started.They were yelling.They would yell and throw things and ma would lick my fur until the shaking stopped.&nbsp;
She would put her big paws over my tiny body and protect.I was safe in the warm and dark, tucked right up against her belly until I drifted to sleep.&nbsp;
One day, she was gone.There was a truck, some soft and kind voices...some food, food, and man it smelled so good, i just wanted to chase, I ran and ran and chased the truck but it was so fast and they were gone.Alone was wrong.It didn't feel like it was mine.I survived.&nbsp;
No kind paws, no licks, no warm belly.It was raining, there was cold and wet.I hate cold and wet.Unless i'm digging it into the ground...but this was the relentless kind, it was like a river but the wrong way up, and i was cold, cold, cold.&nbsp;
I grew.I met so many friends, but none of them looked like me.Some got close.Some of them sniffed.Some of them hissed and scratched me, ow.I paddled in streams and played with birds.I saw others like me.Sometimes they followed me.I could be scary.I learned to protect.I scared other scary things away from smaller things.I protected tiny humans, and baby floofs, and even the little scratchy hissing things.&nbsp;
It felt like I ran all over the world.I'd dug up every patch of dirt there was to dig.I'd howled at the moon and swam in puddles and oceans.But I was cold.I was alone.I got sick.And then I could not protect...not even me.&nbsp;
And then there was...warm?Nice warm paw - soft skin, soft voice.&nbsp;
It held me close to a warm belly and I licked and yipped and wriggled and then there was a big face full of love and all of a sudden I knew I belonged.And so did they.And the Long Happy began.&nbsp;
It was pack.Food.Running.Chasing.Licking.I discovered new things that I loved every single day.I loved the ear scritch, then the belly rub, then that spot on my bum near my tail....the chicken, the pork, the smell of my pack (even better than food).Even when I was alone, I knew I would not always be.&nbsp;
I ran, chased, escaped, caught balls, panting and looking around for the next game.It's hard work!&nbsp;
Tiring work.&nbsp;
I'm great at all those things.&nbsp;
When you win the game every time you can get tired.And after a while, your legs ache a little.It's harder to see.You can't quite run so far.And maybe there are less balls.There are definitely less balls.&nbsp;
I wondered if the Long Happy could end, once.I was afraid.And sore.Would I be cold again?Would there be alone?&nbsp;
I can't see my pack well anymore, but all of a sudden they are there.With their paws, and soft belly, and kisses, and I am so comfy and happy and warm.I sleep, and know that I am safe.I drift away and feel the Long Happy grow longer.I know that it will last forever.
