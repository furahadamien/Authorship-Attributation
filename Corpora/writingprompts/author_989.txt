"I decided to spend $10k...a used car to make my getaway...renting the apartment, and the equipment...I was gonna need a lotta equipment. ""I spent four months trying to move into the apartment, making sure he didn't see me movie in.Now, this guy knows me, he knows me well.I still remember the last time we spoke.I specifically remember telling not to worry..."

- "Ahhh don't even worry about it, Donny, it's only $10, put that fuckin thing to good use now, eh, haa!""But $10 meant a lotta money back the 80's, son...I was saving that money, I meant to buy your mothers wedding ring with that money...plus the money I had left in the bank...$86,400 to be exact"

"I was almost willing to let it go if Donny didn't keep pushing me, Frankie!Believe me I thought about it a million times but I just couldn't help my self, son...it was torturing me, Donny been giving me shit all 10 years we worked with each, he stole my lunch for 7 days in a row, one day after the other every time I reach out for my goddamn tuna fucking sandwich Donny with his fucking goddamn foul tuna breathe had already ate it, that son of a bitch!""I'm telling you he deserved everything that came to him that night...if only it didn't cost me this much...and for what?Look at you, you're a handsome young man Frankie, and all I really wanted to do was what was best for you but I guess that was me rotting in this here jail cell for the rest of my life.""I didn't talk to your mother for 2 weeks, I was out in the apartment planning like goddamn Robert Di Nero in Taxi, getting ready to fuck up his life and get my fucking $10...and my pride!Back!""The night of the attack I stayed up all night...looking out the window, observing Donny's every goddamn move, drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes in an empty apartment, all by myself...I had to do it that night...I remember jacking off to the site of Donny's ugly naked wife taking her clothes off in the bathroom and fingering herself while she had the bottom of her toothbrush up her ass, like the freak she looked like!""...but I couldn't help myself, Frankie!I had been away from your mother for so long, I hadn't slept with her since Donny took that $10 from me..."

"So that night, dressed in all black, I decided to go out there in the dead of night to wrap Donny's car entirely with scotch tape.Back then, Frankie, nobody had ever done that...completely wrap someone's car in tape?Who would ever think of that?And besides!If Donny couldn't get to work the next Monday he was bound to get fired!With the way he's been acting at work I knew it"

"That night I went down there.I saw Donny go up to his apartment...his wife fucking herself in the bathroom and going to sleep...so I did what I had to do, I brought with me enough tape to wrap the entire car..."

"And filled with the ecstasy of a having my plan work out I headed over to the local bar to have a beer and conclude my 4 months hunt if ole Donny...but my night wasn't over yet...apparently, what I hadn't known about Donny was that he was an occasional heroine shooter, the police later found out that he used to shoot heroine on Saturday nights, he would done Sunday morning but they had to go to church, then.""Donny crept down in the middle of the night to get the heroine out of his car and saw what I did to it prematurely.So instead of figuring it out he went to the local bar to get a gram from the bartender who apparently was also the local drug dealer and he saw me, Frankie.""Me and Donny locked eyes, I was clad in black and Donny was in his pajamas.He stood there for a long second before cracking a smile.He came over and ofcourse wondered what the fuck I was doing there in the dead of night at this 24hr bar no one was at but me.And right there I confronted him about the $10, to which he proceeded to take out a bunch of cash from his pocket, give some to the bartender and a 10 to me...without saying any word to the bartender, who went inside the moment he got the cash.""I told Donny I was sorry but Donny didn't know I was the guy who did that to his car, he didn't care the guy was shooting heroin for crying out loud why the hell would he?I mean would you Frankie?"Frankie: "No dad, no.I wouldn't have given a fuck either, to be honest.""But the worst was yet to come..."

"After the bar I was a little but drunk, and decided to let out my demons for one night and gamble at this underground "casino" at 4 am.I ended up betting what was left of my bank account money, Frankie...the ring, the house...everything.I got drunk that night and pulled the gun I had bought in case the thing with Donny went south and started shooting everybody there...the dealer...the players...I ended up killing 3 of em and wounding 6.And thats when the cops came and took me in...I was slurring, I hadn't slept well in months...it was a nightmare, Frankie.."

"And when your mother told me she was pregnant when I was in jail I almost killed myself, Frankie for what I've done...honest to God Frankie.I tied a not and jumped off a chair but the rope couldn't handle my weight and it ended up breaking...I felt so embarrassed..."

F -" well what happened to Donny pops?""I was told Donny OD'd that night and was found dead on the toilet...with a toothbrush up his ass I was told...nobody thinks they're gonna die that way, huh Frankie?"F- "No dad.I'm sure nobody would like to die like that..."
