I had been working for years.Decades even.On my first paycheck I took ten dollars out.And set it aside.I planned to put it in a bank account once I worked enough.About five years after I lost my first job my father died.I never really knew the man.He left when I was seven years old, just a young boy.My mother never once spoke a word about him.There were no traces in our household he ever existed.But he passed away.I received a letter in the mail.No name or address from the sender.It simply said "check your bank account.Your father died."In a neat cursive writing.So I went to the bank.Immediately after I read it.I found $86,400 in it.The banker told me my father had it in his will to give me all of his money.I was so grateful.I pulled the ten out of my wallet.My special ten.Then asked to put in the account.I left and found another job, determined to be as successful as whatever my father did.About a week later I checked my account and it said someone withdrew ten dollars.I was enraged.I went to the bank and asked who withdrew it.Noah Ford.I hadn't seen him in years.He was the man that knew where my father went.But never told me.I took out enough money for six years in detective and law school.I worked hard.Harder than ever.When it was all over I had gotten to an age where anything was possible.Hell I could have ran for president.Instead I spent thousands of dollars on equipment to find Noah.Once I determined his location I booked a flight to Germany.I found his hotel he was staying at.Eventually I was able to identify exactly who he was.I knew where he would go before he did.I only had about five grand left in my account.I spent it buying a sniper and sharpshooting lessons.I knew this was all pointless.I was just a kid from a small town in the middle of nowhere.But here I am.On my way to being one of the best assassins alive.I didn't know if I was going to continue this.I found him in a pub one night.Drunk off his ass.I slowly approached him.And asked if he had a ten I could borrow.He looked at me and smirked."I knew you once.But-" he was cut off by the smashing of a bottle over his head.I left after the incident and waited until the next morning.I found a rooftop right across from his hotel.This was the last night he would stay, so I camped out and waited until he woke up.Once he did I watched his every move.He tried contacting my mother.Little did he know I disconnected the house phone before I left.He gave up and smashed a glass of whiskey to the ground.I learned enough about this man I could tell you what shampoo he uses.I toyed with him.Used an industrial laser and pointed it on the ground in front of him.I did this for an hour.Watched as the rage built from him not seeing my location.He knew it was me.But he also knew it would be a stupid idea to call the police.I waited until he packed his bags.I saw him set the ten.My ten.On his bed.He walked to the window and shouted "do what you please.You will never know what happened to your father".I could have sworn we made eye contact.I took aim and shot.Directly between his eyes.After he was dead I walked into the hotel and asked if I could go and visit him.The receptionist, obviously too intent on whatever was on the screen in front of her let me in.I walked to the bed and picked up the ten.Leaving without a trace.
