INT.UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY - MEETING ROOM - DAY

Outside the room the full general assembly sits and impatiently awaits.The US President is at the podium giving a long winded introduction.Inside a small group of scientists waits to usher out the soon to be newest member, ambassador 457,837,684,729,957,749,737 from the 2nd principles moon of the third planet in the system 4726e6ad.The ambassador is a shifting colored blob of gas encased in glass transported by a hovering computerized disk.A calm and soothing voice comes from the ambassadors metal disk.AMBASSADOR 
Is it true you can only see three basic colors?The group around the Ambassador look at each other, not sure who the Ambassador was talking to.After a few moments,  LEE, one of the scientists from China steps forward and answers in a heavy accent.LEE
Yes Ambassador, we see the colors red, green and blue.Do you see more?AMBASSADOR 
Of course, why else would we be here?Lee and the other scientists look preplexed.LEE
We are aware of the other colors in the spectrum and can translate them in representations which we can see, ultraviolet and thermal.Which do you see?AMBASSADOR 
No, no, no, I'm talking the true fourth color, the color of the Ghoosha.LEE
Ghoosha?I do not know this term.Lee turns to the other scientists, they are all as perplexed as he is.AMBASSADOR 
Ghoosha, the other race on this plant.The ones who called us here.How do you communicate with them if you can't see them?LEE
There is no other race on this planet Ambassador.In the background it sounds like the President is ending his introduction.AMBASSADOR
Well this is confusing.We've seen your movies and know you are aware of the Ghoosha.LEE
Can you explain what a Ghoosha is?AMBASSADOR 
We see them with spectral vision.They are your dead.They are who called us here.At the podium the President steps aside and the Ambassador floats out to the crowd leaving the stupefied scientist behind.
