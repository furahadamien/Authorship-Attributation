HappyCakeDayMan1
I was casually wishing many Redditors a Happy Cake Day and a Merry Christmas when a top comment of the post I commented on appeared.All of a sudden many wholesome comments got into my inbox wishing me Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year.It wasnt long before they started saying I was loved and accepted as an amazing novelty account.The wholesomeness overcame me as I searched for more people with their Cake Day.And as the day ended I said Happy Cake Day to some and to all a Happy New Year!Merry Christmas everyone!
