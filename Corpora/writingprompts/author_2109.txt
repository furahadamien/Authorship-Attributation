Without hesitation I lunge for her throat with my hands and start squeezing.Her screams fill my brain.Shes asking me, pleading, screaming for me to stop.She screams why over and over but slowly and surely the yelling is getting lower and lower and it stops.I barely notice the people around me, pulling me off.I dont see the officers  running towards me as Im being held down by many hands.All I can think of is of the peace.All I can think about is the quiet.I smile and breathe a sigh of relief as the hands walk me to the squad car.Peace at last.
