George looks over the draft and immediately begins talks with several studios on producing a live action tv series based on the wildly popular books.He then shelves the manuscript whilst making several promises several years apart that he is nearly finished.The show gains wild popularity and takes a wildly different turn than what the original cannon had talked about.The show wraps many years later and George dies before he can finish his "almost finished" book that the original fans have been waiting fucking years for.Anyone who ever picked up the Harry Potter series wished they never touched it and curse the day they got involved with another unfinished story.
