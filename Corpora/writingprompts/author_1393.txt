The_Keno
It was not often that I looked upon the mortal realm.Living souls on my world were growing ever-abundant, and for each new life, the promise of new death came as well.It was a steady stream of power that I took for granted, certainly enough to keep me satisfied.My power grew each century as the human population staggered upward.And then one day, I felt it.A pulse of power.The colossal loss of life in a near instant.Perhaps a few million souls.Life sat across the chessboard from me, a worried look in his eye."Likely just a large meteor again, I'm sure it will be fine."I reached forward to move my bishop, when a felt another pulse.Life's face was twisted in agony.A series of pulses came, and my power grew beyond Life's as he weakened and I booned.He groaned and collapsed to the floor, and despite my sudden advantage over him, I peered toward our planet in fear.Once life and I had been enemies, but even as I hated him, he was necessary for my own existence.For there cannot be Death without Life.Nothing appeared to be striking the planet, yet massive explosions seemed to plague the surface.Not giant meteors, no external energy sources.I closed my eyes and felt the heat of the planet's core.No signs of release or pressure.Volcanic activity was under check.How was such destruction occurring?I used my power to slow time and establish a presence all upon the surface.The humans were at war?Yet there seemed to be no battlefield.Another pulse.Fire, energy, death.I surrounded the source with my presence.The explosion appeared to come from the sky.I turned my attention to the air...

Metal monstrosities soared in the skies, each one with the power to snuff out more lives than the greatest war.What had the humans done...

With a clench of my fist, I erased the terrible weapons.It drained much of my newfound power, but I could feel the slow, painful deaths of those around the world.85% of humans had already perished.I need not worry about lacking in power this day.I followed the gaseous trails they left behind to facilities of iron and steel.The humans there had caused this destruction.They had the audacity to complain at the malfunction of their weapons.Why had they done such a thing?What good could come of such massive death?Even the plants and animals would struggle to survive this.They burned from the inside-out at the wave of my hand.As their souls left their bodies, I snatched them.Few had the honor of coming to my realm.I looked upon the surface of my world.Once, this sight would have brought upon a smile on my lips.Now, I thought of what would become of Life.I found him frail, bloodied and dying.He was unconscious, and in such a state he could not use his power.I felt myself begin to panic.I had great power now, but it could only destroy.What could I do?Where would I begin?***My first prompt!Usually I write drafts of plot and go back to fill it in a bit more.Let me know if you like the ideas, at least.
