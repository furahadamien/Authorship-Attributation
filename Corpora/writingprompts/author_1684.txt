The recipe was simple.The ingredients gathered and ready to cook.Chicken soup.How hard could it be?Wasn't like I was summoning a demon.I followed the cookbook step by step.The ingredients were as followed.One chicken
4 cups of chicken broth
4 cups of water
Pinch of salt 
Pepper
Egg noodles
Carrots
Flour
I read aloud from the book as I prepared the ingredients.Prepare a pot with the water, chicken broth, salt, carrots and egg noodles.Bring to a low boil and let simmer.While doing so, place the chicken on a large ( at least 3 feet from center ( didn't have a table big enough.So, I had to use the floor) surface.And draw a circle around it, using flour.Connect the circle into a pentagram.Chant Elahari, Elsharye Ountuk Godhen.Rise colonel of the south.Colonel of abomination.After chanting these words place the chicken and a handful of the flour into the pot.This must be to release the flavor.I placed the remaining ingredients."Nothing to do but wait for it to finish cooking" 
I remarked to myself.A puff of smoke billowed from the pot and it began to take shape into something familiar.The white suit and black tie; though initially out of focus soon came into view.Along with the white hair and trademark goatee.I had done more than cook chicken soup, I had summoned a demon.One that seemed nonplussed with me.I was too afraid to address it.So, I stared at it in awe.I mean I had questions.For starters; how does colonel Sanders become a demon?How did I even summon a demon?And how long was my grandmother into the occult?But before I could will my mouth to move, Colonel Sanders began to speak."Hey, boy!You only have 7 herbs and spices.You need 11 herbs and spices to summon me.Gather those together and you will an unbeatable demon.""Oh yeah?I retorted."You ever face a Ronald?
