It was a cold night, and Dana had just died.She was standing in a grassy little field, in a small part of a large city.Before her was a shrouded figure, whose every feature was made of the stuff between stars.Darkness incarnate."Ah shit."**GOOD, YOU UNDERSTAND.** The figures voice was soft and deep like distant thunder.He produced a scythe, so visibly sharp it shivered the eyes.**THAT SAVES US SOME TIME.COME WITH ME.**  
  
"And if I don't want to?"The figure leaned down slowly, eye level with Dana.Nothing could be seen beyond his hood.**HOW RUDE OF ME.ALLOW ME TO REPHRASE: MAY I SHOW YOU TO THE AFTERLIFE?**  
  
Dana considered, attempting to haunt some strollers in the park.She couldn't so much as knock an ice-cream cone out of a childs hand.She wasn't able to fly either, though it made little sense that gravity should bother with spirits.Less spirited without the prospect of a good haunting, she sighed."Lead the way."The two set a walking pace through the city.They passed through buildings sometimes, as Death desired.Othertimes they would follow the streets, glancing through taxis with angry drivers, children sleeping in the backs of minivans with bleary-eyed parents, blurry figures huddled around a rubbish-fire.A domestic argument, a lonely pregnant woman watching television, a man ceremonially donning a business suit, mice in a cupboard.A shadow of a girl slipped between streetlights, following a young boy with gel in his hair."So you mentioned that, because I knew I was dead the moment I saw you, it would save us time right?"**RIGHT.**  
  
"Are we in a hurry or something?"Death shrugged.**NOT PARTICULARLY.**  
  
"Cuz if we can walk in a straight line, this route seems sort of roundabout.Where in the hell is the afterlife?Thought it was just straight up."**IT'S NOT A VERY DIRECT ROUTE.THAT'S ONE REASON WHY I CHOSE TO STICK AROUND.**  
  
They passed a merry-go-round with the lights out; it was after closing at the carnival."Ah."**TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF, IF YOU LIKE.**   
  
Death would nod and respond as she told him.About her troubled youth, the time when CPS came, dropping out of high-school, working minimum wage well into her 30's, and selling tons of drugs on the side.She told him about Andy Pilgrim who kissed her cheek in 1st grade, how on his 16th birthday they rode a ferris wheel together, when he got married to a girl out of state, how she never really moved on but could never see them actually getting together.And every good and bad time between 1989 and now that she could remember.Tireless, they traversed multiple state lines.They passed a deserted drive-in theater, a long and winding interstate, a sleepy town with a family pharmacy buy 2 get 1 free, a missing cat poster, a lake which held the shadows of fishermen in it's wide palm, a graveyard whose stones had weathered rain for nearly a century, a Motel 6 whose 't' had burned out or perhaps had been struck by a rock.They passed a food truck busily serving late night patrons as Dana asked, "What about you?"**THERE'S NOT MUCH TO SAY, REALLY.**  
  
"Don't be modest, you're Death!With a capital D!"They walked down the pier, a ferris wheel loomed against a starry sky."How long have you been ferrying souls?"**SINCE THE FIRST HUMAN DEATH.AN ANTHROPOLOGIST TOLD ME ONCE THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEARLY 66 MILLION YEARS AGO.**  
  
"Woa," Dana let that number sink in."So he was a caveman right?"**HE DID NOT LIVE IN A CAVE, BUT YES.**  
  
"And this was you right?You said you stuck around."Death turned.**YES, QUITE PERCEPTIVE OF YOU.**  
  
"You speak English fairly well for a 66 million year old caveman."Dana winked and punched his arm, friendly-like.He didn't laugh, but seemed to appreciate the gesture anyway.**LOTS OF PRACTICE.**  
  
They walked to the end of the pier, where the guardrail protects pedestrians from a 20ft drop into the water.Death and Dana stepped onto the open air as if they had done so all their lives.**IS THERE A LANGUAGE YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN?**  
  
They walked into the horizon, above the ground, in a straight line.They continued on in just the same casual stroll, walking into space while the world spun away.The length of their conversation could not possibly be measured, nor their journey.Though on this journey it is worth noting that Death, the first man who had died, chose Ator as a true name.Posthumously, of course, for he had no name in life.They came to a small platform, in a place where all the stars were behind them.**HOPE I DIDN'T RUIN THE SURPRISE.**  
  
"You mentioned it would be underwhelming.So i just step on it?"**YES.**  
  
"And where does it take me?"**I HAVE SEEN FIRE, LIGHT, FEATHERS, RAINBOWS, TENTACLES, PEARLY GATES, CLOUDS, LIGHTNING AND ALL MANNER OF THINGS EMERGE FROM THAT PLATFORM.IT TAKES YOU WHERE YOU WERE MEANT TO GO.**  
  
"Well, I suppose it's time."She embraced the specter known as Death, as Ator."I...Thank you, so much."He held her gently and brushed a tear away.**YOU ARE VERY WELCOME.THE JOURNEY IS HARD WHEN YOU ARE ALONE WITH YOUR THOUGHTS.**  
  
"And you have to walk back..."  
  
**I KNOW THE WAY.AND I KNOW MANY SONGS.**  
  
Dana let him go, and walked to the platform.She held her breath, stepped onto it, and stood, waiting.For a fair while.**THAT'S A NEW ONE.**  
  
"Maybe it's not my time?"**PERHAPS.**  
  
"Well we'll always return to Earth just in time for the next death right?Time is kinda screwy for us, right?"**IN ALL MY YEARS I HAVE NEVER UNRAVELLED THE MYSTERY OF MY PERCEPTION OF TIME.**  
  
"So... You ever check out any cool planets?"
