My husband's head was cocked to one side, a look of consternation mingled with amusement on his face."Do you think we'll have to join his church?"He wondered and I couldn't help but laugh.The pony was a gorgeous obsidian black that looked almost purple and blue as it moved through the light, and her mane shimmered with a strange, almost pearly, black iridescence."I wonder if Hell has a return policy?""We can't return her!"Lilith shrieked, her eyes wide with sudden terror.How do kids hear things like that but not when I ask her to pick up her toys?A mystery that may never be solved.My husband and I exchanged glances.Well, now what?We had a large enough yard, we could likely build a little stable and make it work.Lilith laughed as the pony nuzzled her hair, seemingly tame.I realized what terrible parents we were, standing there staring dumbstruck at the beast while our daughter petted and cooed at it, but the pony seemed harmless.Until it hiccuped a white hot jet of fire straight down into the snow, melting a two foot radius.Luckily, our dear Lily was clear of it but she screamed anyway.My husband lit up, his eyes suddenly ablaze (pardon the pun).I knew that look.That look meant that he had an idea, one of his harebrained schemes like the time he decided it would add value to our house to put a bathroom in the basement.Two years later he had a few studs put in, a toilet not attached to anything in a corner and no future goals in mind."I know exactly what to do," he rubbed his hands together like a kid on Christmas.(Very fitting, given our current scenario.)"We can train it to melt the driveway.I'll never have to plow again!"It's been three years since then and while my husband suffered a fairly significant burn that first year, it's been pretty smooth sailing with Dory.My husband likes to call her our "Little Gift From Below," and whenever people ask us our secret to having such a perfectly cleared driveway, that's who he thanks.They think he means salt.We even have her stocking hanging on the mantle and while we haven't officially joined his church, Satan still sees fit to leave her lumps of sulphury flesh in there every Christmas.
