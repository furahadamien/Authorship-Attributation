In a language both grating to hear and difficult to master, yet immensely more elegant than any human tongue, an open report is given to a board of exoarchaeologists and exoanthropologists."On the topic of Earth, first findings and contact, from the expedition lead Enchri, the lead researcher Ravme, and the warp-bridge consulting specialist Carm.I am Ravme and will begin with the background, where Carm and Enchri will proceed with background and findings.Please, feel free to interject if any clarifications are needed or if any questions arise."Ravme paused and straightened her unaccustomed formal wear before continuing."In 1837 we recorded the first now confirmed transmission from the Terran, or Earthling, population.For ease of annunciation I'll refer to them as Terrans from here on out.From this transmission alone we could not locate the origin, and the transmission itself was erratic due to the distance traveled, but due to the following transmissions over the next 300 years we were able to triangulate the source galaxy, one from 30.2 billion light-years away.This distance was unfathomable at the time, but we did have concrete recordings and data describing an evolutionary and descendant species not dissimilar to Carm's species, the Undyne, or the Felchor of the Uma system."In the following 2,800 years stories of this Terran race popped in and out of, if you forgive the pun, universal culture, seemingly revived by each discovery of a new species in or branch, neighborhood, or cluster.We attribute this resurgence to be the cause of continued interest in Terra and its people, and the reason we're able to stand before you today."As you know, recent discoveries in the infinite probability interactions of matter-antimatter reactions within a null-point field have catapulted intergalactic transport to new levels.We took advantage of this new technology with field-leader, and exo enthusiast, Carm, to both make the first multi-billion light-year leap, and to glimpse the planet of our shared interest.Before I hand off to Enchri to describe the events following the jump, do we have any questions?"
