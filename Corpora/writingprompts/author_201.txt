I stilled dreamed of seeing.I think that's why I initially snoozed my alarm clock instead of gasping for joy.But as I rolled back over to look at my wife lying next to me, I did gasp.Not for joy, but out of shock.On the wall behind Kathrine a message had been hastily painted on the wall.\-DON'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE-

"What's wrong?"Katherine said groggily but alarmed.Her vacant stare reminding me that for the last 2 years I have been blind.I am unable to respond as the realization of what is happening has not fully dawned on me."Jim?!"she now sounds more awake and even more concerned.She flails out her arms searching for me and when her hand rest on my shoulder I have regained enough composure to speak."N-nothing."I stammer."Just had a nightmare."The tension in her face eases as her hand glides up to my face and leans in for a kiss."you had me worried."She sighs."Do you want to talk about it?""No."I respond quietly, still trying to get my bearings.I sit up and look around the room growing more confused and horrified as I do.On every available surface I can see the same message has been painted.\-DON'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE-

The paint is obviously not new, as it has slightly faded from a bright red, to a more rusted maroon.I also see the guide rod we have been using to navigate the new home we were given a year after the great blinding took place.The room looked very different from how I dreamed of it.It seemed smaller and dust has settled on all the surfaces that were not regularly used.As I took in the first glimpses of the room I have spent the last year in, growing more uneasy as I read the same message over and over, I felt a hand on the small of my back.I gave a startled yelp and nearly jumped out of bed."Must have been a bad one."Kathrine giggled from behind me."Sure you don't want to talk about it?""Maybe later."I mumbled.I turned to face her and was overcome with emotion.In 2 years she hasn't changed much.Her chestnut hair was longer than I remembered it and was haphazardly strewn around her.Her soft smile showed a few more smiles lines around the corners of her mouth.The eyes were the biggest difference.They looked glossed over and unfocused, the rich brown covered with a grayish haze.I felt a pang of sadness and guilt wash over me as I stared at those eyes.The mixture of joy and grief became too much and I excused myself to go to the bathroom.As I stood up to leave, I finally noticed the dark amorphous shape in the corner and stopped with my breath caught in my throat.It wavered on the edges as if it were pulsing or breathing.It seemed to be pulling in the light around it further obscuring it from my sight.I reached out to steady myself on the guide rod and as I did, the shaped slithered into the bathroom."Hurry up," Kathrine complained, "I need to go too."
