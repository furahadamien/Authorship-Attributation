You reach and touch your face, feeling that something is there but you cannot see it.You pull ever so gently and feel that what ever is on their can be removed.You tighten your grasp and pull harder when suddenly a rush of white light envelops you.Stumbling around completely disoriented, your vision begins to regain its focus.You see a short blue figure in front of you reaching for what was previously on your face.In a language you once called your native tongue it says "let me help you with this".You catch a glimpse of a shimmering piece of metal on his body.Squinting your eyes to better read what is written on it, it says "greg-bestbuy".The blue figure then softly exclaims "alright sir, your 10 minute demo is up, how did you like the new occulus rift immersive experience?"
