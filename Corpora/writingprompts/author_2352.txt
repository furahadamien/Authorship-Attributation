The field coil blew out with an audible *pop* around 8,055 CE.The world snapped into view, and I emerged from the twilit void of Ur-travel blinking and disoriented.At least the air was breathable.In fact, it was beautiful here, trees stretching off into a valley ahead; rainclouds off in the distance, rolling away.The air smelled like spring.My chronometer was completely useless.It would take until nightfall to realign with the celestial sphere, provided the sun still set as usual.The last time I touched down there was some sort of geoengineering project screwing with the insolation, so I had packed up and moved on in hopes of getting my bearings back.Looking east, I spotted a telltale sign of habitation on the side of the valley: a straight line, most likely a wall or road embankment.Gathering up the remains of my generator into my knapsack, I began the hike to see who still lived here.Within a mile the trees thinned out and my destination was clear.Ruins, big ones, at the same location as the old monastery.With luck, I'd have shelter for the night.Hiking into the clearing surrounding the crumbling walls, I saw clear signs of humanity.Bowls, jars, upturned logs hollowed out; rain catchment.Good.I wouldn't need the power-hungry little condenser I'd squirreled away.Radiation was probably almost nil, too, if the water was drinkable.Making my way to the rough arch of the old gatehouse, I nearly tripped as I heard a slight cough from behind me.Whirling, I saw a wizened old man staring curiously at me, clutching a graying wooden staff and clothed in a rough cape and sun-browned skin.His expression was sharp, guarded; he shaded his eyes with a gnarled hand and squinted at me."Do you live here?Someone I used to know did," I asked, but even as I began to speak he shook his head, mouth turned down in disappointment.He tapped his throat, then met my gaze as he shook his head deliberately.Ah, no talking.Gotcha.I opened my hands and spread my arms: no weapons.After a minute of contemplation the old man nodded and began shambling toward the ruins, beckoning with his free hand.As he led me through the overgrown stone arches and walls, my suspicions were confirmed.This was Sven's place, alright; there was the old pavilion where he'd anoint the new supplicants; to the side were the tiny rooms where Searchers slept, resting from their biomedical quest for inner peace.Beyond were the rusting metal walls of the labs, empty of the machinery that once hummed in secret.The old man moved slowly, but he knew every step, stepping surely over tussocks of field grass and tangled roots my feet managed to stumble on.At the covered, mossy arch of the old chapel door he paused, looking back at me, giving me a thorough once-over.He nodded shortly, grunting, and pulled back the twisted cloth hung from the pillars to either side.He waved me in.Blinking in the cool dimness, I saw a household that wouldn't look out of place an eon ago.Unglazed pottery lined the walls, bundles of plants tied to vines hanging from the hewn stone.A low pile of coals smoldered in a pit where the old lectern had been, pews long gone.A shapeless mass of straw and animal skins made for a bed in the far corner.The old man looked around, searching for something, and then grunted in satisfaction as he hobbled to a rough table.He turned and handed me a small stick; a twig, really.Deliberately he held up his hand, rubbing forefingers and thumb together, glancing at the twig.*More*.I nodded, looking him in the eye, and he gestured in an offhand way at the arch, outside.*Back out*, I suppose.I left him in his little stone cave, and headed for the woods for more kindling.It was nearly nightfall when I finished, an armload of twigs from the forest floor in tow.The old man had been busy; a new fire burned in the pavilion's fire pit, streaming sparks and smoke into the sky.A spit rested nearby, tiny carcasses skewered neatly on top.Rats, most likely, but maybe cuy or one of the mod-species of rabbit that used to tunnel in these hills.Either way I wasn't complaining if he wanted to share.He nodded in satisfaction as I dumped the twigs in a pile by the worn stone bench adjacent the fire.He sat, and began to pick them up, one by one, breaking off bits here and there, sizing them evenly.Eventually he looked up from his task, eying me as I busied myself with realigning transformer guts and rewiring the field coil.He stretched, yawning, and poked at the sizzling little creatures on the fire, pulling one off the makeshift spit and offering it to me.I nodded in thanks, blowing on the hot meat and brushing off char.It wasn't bad, a little gamey maybe.He seemed healthy enough; I wasn't worried what exactly I was eating.As we reached the bone-gnawing end of our meal, he belched noisily and tossed the remains into the dark.Wiping his hands, he looked at me significantly and reached for the twigs he had set aside.Carefully he sorted them; three small piles on the smooth stone bench.He looked at me, imploring, and held up one twig.Tapping his chest, then the twig, he raised his eyebrows.Gesturing to me, he tapped the twig again, and another eyebrow raise.*Us, get it?* I nodded on agreement.He gestured at the piles, then flung his hands out as if to encompass the ruins, the valley, the world.*Everyone*.I nodded again.He took his twig, setting it aside, and picked up two more, one each from the two nearest piles.Holding them in front of his face, he pressed them together in an X, rubbing them together furiously.Pressing hard, they both snapped, and he held them out again, broken and dangling.*Conflict*.He threw them to the ground, suddenly vicious, and grabbed the two piles, smashing them together as they splintered and broke apart.Suddenly he threw them into the fire where the green wood hissed and spit, crackling.Chest heaving with exertion, he stared at me darkly.*War*.After a moment, he took the third pile, and, one by one, getting faster with each, he began heaving the sticks into the dark space beyond the pavilion wall, finally jumping to his feet and flinging the remainder all at once.Wheezing gently, he stared off into the blackness of the forest.Turning to me, I noticed a tear rolling down his ancient face.With a quivering hand, he pointed up, up into the night sky.I followed his bony hand to see the moon; even though it was waxing I could see the bright rings and sparkling points shimmering across the surface.Dropping his hand, he looked at me tearfully.He held up the lone remaining twig, tapping his chest again slowly.*Alone*.Standing, I reached out to him, taking his shaking hand.Tapping his chest, then mine, I pointed to the sky, circling the moon, clasping his palm tightly.Staring into his eyes I implied the invitation: *come with me?*  

Longingly, he gazed at me, before dropping my hand, turning back to the fire.Hunching, he sat, looking vacantly at the flames.
