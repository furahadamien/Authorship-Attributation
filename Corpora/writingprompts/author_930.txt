It's funny.I thought I beat him at his own game.I've seen all of humanity die, our planet wither away, and every century the sun gets hotter and hotter as it expands and begins its death cycle.I have lived millions of years alone.I'm a husk in this abyssal existence.Joke's on me, Satan.You won after all.

I begin to follow the red line and am promptly hit by a car back onto the green line.I can't tell how many of my bones are broken, but I see a heavenly being appear before me and shake his head as I begin to fall.Deeper and deeper.Flames begin to engulf me as I land in molten rock.My body does not deteriorate and my pain remains......I should have just stayed in line like a good boy.... Don't follow the damned red line.
