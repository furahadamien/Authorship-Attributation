I closed my eyes and brought my fingers up to my temples, pretending to be deep in concentration."You're 23," I said."Your middle name is... May... and you're from Gary, Indiana.""What!?"Gasped her friend, as they exchanged shocked looks."What about me, guess me!"She said as she quickly pulled a five dollar bill from her leopard-print clutch and tossed it into my jar.I quickly glanced above the woman's head before closing my eyes and going into my usual routine."Okay... 26.Your middle name is Nicole, and you're... also from Gary!""Oh my god!This is totally going on my Facebook!"She squeaked excitedly as she walked off with her cellphone in hand.Four months prior, I wouldn't have predicted that my dumb party trick would have made me one of the most successful street performers in the city.When I moved to New York I pictured myself becoming a Broadway producer or the editor of a famous magazine.As it was, I couldn't cut it as a stagehand and the website I had been writing for didn't pay much.Luckily I was making enough to cover my rent and then some.Here's my scam: For 5 bucks I'll guess your exact age, middle name, and place of birth - the kind of stuff you don't usually advertise on social media.If I guess wrong, you get your money back.Only I'm never wrong, because I'm not guessing.There was a small crowd of about a dozen people gathered around me on the sidewalk, not bad for a Tuesday afternoon.A kid and his father stepped towards my jar, the boy dropped in a bill."Hmmm," I mused scratching my chin."You're 4 and a half.You're middle name is... Nathaniel, and you're from Syracuse!"I winked at him as he turned to look up at his dad with a smile on his face.When I was in the 7th grade, I attempted to climb a radio tower on a dare.It was January, and I didn't make it very far before I slipped and fell off.I woke up to my friend Collin standing over me, and just above his head I could see his full name, age, and place of birth.I blinked, rubbed my eyes, shook my head, but the floating letters and numbers wouldn't go away.I thought that I was concussed, and so did Collin when I told him.I was.And though concussion eventually went away, the floating ID tags never did.I thought that they couldn't be real at first, that I was just imagining things.But the information was always correct, whether I was looking at a close friend or a perfect stranger.Following my psychologist's advice I ignored it for most of my life, until college when I realized that I could use my skill to make a few bucks and impress girls at parties.People loved to guess how I did it, and I loved to hear their theories.As the father and son made their way down the street, my next volunteer dropped their money into my jar.I stole a glance and closed my eyes."Hmmmm... let's see.You're 41.Your middle-" I opened my eyes to see a man pushing his way through my audience, knocking over a teenager who had been obliviously wrapped up in his phone.I instinctually looked up to see who this jerk was and saw something that made me go cold.The man barreling through my crowd was 1841 years old, with a name that I couldn't pronounce.I tried to yell after him, but the words were stuck in my throat.Just then, a man in a black suit appeared, hot on his trail, deftly weaving through the people on the sidewalk.My eyes darted over to read the ID of the man in the suit, and to my disbelief I saw... nothing.Something felt wrong.I turned to my left, back towards the man running frantically down the street.He was looking over his shoulder at his pursuer, who was quickly closing in on him.A look of desperation flashed across his face.I looked on helplessly as he shoved the father of the boy who had just left my act, into the busy New York street.The car that hit him had no time to react as he slammed into the windshield.They hit their breaks and the man rolled onto the pavement, dead.The man in the black suit abruptly stopped and turned to move towards the body in the street.The crowd around me exploded in gasps and screams as they rushed to his side.For a moment I was frozen.I watched the murderer round the corner and disappear.I looked back to the man in the black suit, kneeling over the body of the boy's father.He shook his head and then proceeded to do something odd.He placed his hand above the face of the deceased and muttered something.An instant later a bright flash emanated from his palm.He stood up and walked back onto the sidewalk, pulled a small book from his jacket and began to scribble something down.The people who rushed to help seemed not even to notice the man in the suit.An older couple were attempting to comfort the child.Several people were calling for help on their phones.A few huddled over the man in the street.Nervously, I approached the man in the suit.When I was standing directly in front of him, he looked up at me with an eyebrow raised.He quickly looked behind himself and then back to me.Our eyes met."I don't believe you're on the schedule for today."He said, sounding a bit confused."What?"I asked."What's going on here?Who was that man you were chasing and who are you?"He looked past me, to my sidewalk sign."Samuel, is it?"He said, smugly."It seems like you've got a knack for knowing who people are, so you tell me."I didn't know what I should tell him.As a rule I never tell people my secret.Talking about my ability never goes over very well and nobody ever believes me, but I was unsettled by the events of the past few minutes and I was about to make an exception."I know that the man you were chasing was 1841 years old."The man in the suit went wide eyed at hearing this."He had a name that I couldn't pronounce, but you..."

"But me?"He said with a smirk."I can't...I don't know who you are, and that's unusual for me"

"Interesting."He said.He turned and started walking down the alley behind him."Follow me, please."I hesitated, but I had to know the truth.I needed to hear what he had to say.I followed him about halfway down the alley before he stopped and turned to face me."Tell me how you knew that the man I chased was so old."He said.Something in his voice gave me the chills, and I started to question if following him into this alley was a mistake."I saw his age."I said, nervously."And his name.I can see these things when I look at someone, their information... is always just sort of floating above them."He nodded, making another note in his book."Can you see anything else about them?"He asked."Yeah, I can see where they were born too, but that's it."He seemed relieved to hear that."Well Sam, I've never met a mortal with this particular gift of sight before.You'd do well not to attract so much attention to yourself.As to the man I was chasing, you should stay as far away from him as possible.Give me your phone."He said as he reached his hand out."Why?""Sam, if you see that man again I want you to call me.He is very dangerous.""Clearly."I said, handing him my phone."But who are you and what do you want with him?What is he, like a vampire or something?""A vampire?No, it's the middle of the day and they haven't surfaced in ages."He said, with an ounce of ridicule in his voice."That man is a thief, and a murder.Nothing more."He handed me my phone back."If you do see him again, you should call me at once."A voice called from down the alley, "Sir, we would like to take a statement from you.Can you come talk to us for a minute?"It was a police officer."Yes, ma'am.Just a moment."I shouted.When I turned around, the man in the suit had disappeared.I looked down at my phone to see what he had entered."Death"
