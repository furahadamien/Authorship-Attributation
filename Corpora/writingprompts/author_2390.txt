Being a hero means not going around making sure everyone knows you're a hero.It means you don't wear a bright flashy outfit, you don't pose for the cameras, and you don't go around telling everyone who you are.It also means that sometimes, you have to be willing to do things that others won't.Sometimes it means that you have to do things that will make you hated.Because what you do is more important than your reputation, it's more important than recognition... it's more important than *you*.What I'm about to do, most would call murder.But they don't see what I see.I see someone who calls himself a hero when he's anything but.He's the sort to wear the bright colors, to pose for every photo op, he even has a fan club for kids.For *kids*.But I've seen what he's like when he thinks no one is looking, how he takes joy in hobbling and suffocating innocent people.He has killed more people than any of these so-called "villains" he fights.And he needs to be stopped, even if it means being despised for it.That's what a *real* hero would do.He calls himself Captain Justice.I know who he really is.Bradley Evans.Captain of his high school football team, valedictorian, sociopath.Always excelled, always succeeded at life, often at the expense of others, people he stepped on or crushed to get ahead in life.Now he's moved on from stepping on classmates to stepping on the good people of this city.No more.I open the door to his house, lock easily picked.He doesn't have any security system, no guard dog.Why would he need one?He's Captain Justice, and he thinks he's invincible.But every man needs to sleep.I find his bedroom, with him in his bed.Good.I can make this quick, easy.I bring out my knife.Not a steel knife, mind you, but a ceramic one.I've studied the man enough to see that steel won't pierce his skin, but for some reason, he was cut by a thrown flowerpot on one occasion.Evidently ceramic is some sort of weakness of his.Don't know why.As I approach, his eyes open.Damn that super-hearing of his.He lays eyes on me approaching, and speaks not a word.He doesn't ask why I'm here, doesn't give me any "heroic" warning, just gets into a fighting stance.Ah well, not so easy after all.Well, if I should die in this fight, so be it.He punches toward me with a speed and strength that could shatter bone.I dodge to the side, barely evading him.He reaches for my throat and I jump back, a mere fraction of a second before his fist closes shut with a force that could have instantly crushed my windpipe.Our dance goes on like this, with him attacking and me evading, but I know that I can't keep doing this.If I'm on the defensive, I have to be lucky every time, and he only needs to be lucky once.I need to go on the offense.I thrust my knife at him, misjudging the distance to him and missing him by inches.He responds with a smirk, seeing the knife and finding it amusing.He then reaches his fist back for a punch and I'm overextended, some part of me knows I can't dodge in time.In desperation, I fall forward, knife held above me.It plunges deep into his neck.For a moment, we two are frozen there.I am terrified that any movement will spur him to act, that if he even thinks for a single second, this terrible man will surely reach out and end me.But perhaps there is some greater power looking over me, because he does no such thing.He only slumps over backward, wheezing as he struggles for breath.I don't have any sort of killer ironic line to drop on him at this point, no pithy catchphrase.He may have been a monster, but he was also a man, and no man's death deserves to be treated lightly, even one so terrible as this.Rather than make him suffer, I withdrew the knife from his neck and plunged it into his ear, skewering his brain.His wheezing stopped and he fell silent.I removed my knife and went to the sink to cleanse it, making sure not to leave any fingerprints or any other indication of who I am.I could breathe again.This nightmare was over.True, there were other nightmares to face, but that could wait until tomorrow.For tonight, I could sleep well, knowing that this man would never again be a blight on this city, never again would he hobble them by doing for them things they should find the capacity to do for themselves, never again would he suffocate them by treating them as a master treats a pet, protecting them and scolding them whenever they do wrong, instead of treating them like men, capable of learning and growing and standing on their own two feet.Tomorrow, the city will wake, and there will be no more Captain Justice, and everyone can begin the healing process, no longer looking to the skies for someone to save them, but looking within themselves.I expect no thanks for this deed.I expect to be hated.But a true hero doesn't care what others think.He only cares that he has made the world a better place.---------------------
