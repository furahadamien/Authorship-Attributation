The cashier gave me the same look they all have given me.His eyes were welling with tears as he tried to catch his breath.He knew who I was."I'm so very sorry," I whispered softly as to not alarm anyone else."I can make it very quick and dignified and you will feel no pain."I handed the cashier my debit card to ring the charge for my meal through, but he just stood there and continued to stare at me."Are...are you here for me?You can't be.....your boss and I had a deal...."

"About that deal," I began "It was void the day you paid in full for him to spare your life for eternity."As I said the words, I could see him begin to crumble."But my daughters were pure," he choked out "They were only two and four years old!""We know," I said as I watched the color of life start to fade from his skin."They were pure, but their souls were already owned by someone else.We weren't able to collect, so I've come to collect you."The cashier slumped over on the floor and I tucked my card back in my wallet as I ducked out from the crowd that was beginning to form around the body on the floor.I stepped out the door and was met by the cashier once again.As we began to walk away from the restaurant together, I allowed him to ask me one more question, "So if the deal was that I live for eternity for two pure souls, and my deal was void, then why did he let me live for 1000 years before taking me?"I stopped walking and turned to face him, "You didn't fully realize what you were getting into when you made your deal with my boss.It's the goddamn fine print that says he can punish you in any way he wants if the deal falls through."The wind as starting to pick up and pulled up my hood as I continued to explain, "He likes to make it hurt as much as possible for some, so he let you live for 1000 years so that you have 1000 years of painful experiences, broken hearts, friends lost, loves lost, sickness, broken bones, failures, humiliations, and defeats to remember.And that's all you get to remember for eternity.Every good memory you had from your life has now been deleted.All you get to remember is all of the ones you've tried your hardest to forget.You will relive every one of them over and over again for eternity."The cashier began to sob and I turned and kept walking because I didn't want to see the face of someone who has had all goodness stripped of them, they barely look human.I saw the remnant of the flash from behind me and I knew the cashier was gone."Another day done," I said and picked up my pace because it was getting late.I just wanted to get home and get some rest because tomorrow was another day full of appointments.
