Im lying in a bed on a tuesday night.And Im having restless dreams.And then I awake from a story where Im rescuing a princess from a wheel of cheese.Because theres a chainsaw on my nightstand.A groggy hand reaches over and slaps it reluctantly.Is it morning...a alarm?Some long lost love looking for luscious life-experiences?But no a text message.Is it my wife?Will she be late tonight?DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON

So I make a curious eye sweep of the room.I pause at my window, where the forbidden object lies, and return my gaze in the opposite direction.Nothing.So, eyes squeezed shut, I walk over to the window.Just in case.I have a moment of panic when I trip on a errant pair of pants, but I right myself quickly.Then, in a fleeting, fluttering, futile gesture, I bravely bring down the blinds.With that dangerous task complete, I sprint back to my bed, as if its covers will protect me from whatever has infested the sky.Perhaps its just a joke, or the product of a overtaxed imagination.But somehow I know to be afraid.Buzz.Another a text?More instructions?Is there something else Im not supposed to look at?Its from a old coworker.A good friend.Its a beautiful night tonight.Look outside.

I peek out from beneath my blanket bastion.A windows shuttered and silent.A door, barely open, with a crooked mouth along its length, mocking me.Should I close it?No.Too dangerous.So I close my eyes and whisper.Just a dream.Just a dream.Just a dream.


Buzz.Another text message.Perhaps I shouldnt


Its a beautiful night tonight.Look outside. from my best man.Then a bing.A different app, I have so many.Its a beautiful night tonight.Look outside.

And then my phone begins to shake and chatter, with bings and chimes and whistles.Each one is like a stab in my stomach.Whats happening?Whats happening?Then bit by bit, the phone sounds die out.Then a new sound.A ringing.A bold, unique choice for a ringtone in this day and age, but Ive always been a trend setter.Its my wife.Is she safe?Does she know whats happening?And before I can catch myself, I hit the answer button.(Part 1?Sorry for a cliffhanger, it was getting long)
