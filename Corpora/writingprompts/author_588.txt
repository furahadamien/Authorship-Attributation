My name is Geoff, and I work as a CPA for a fairly prestigious accounting firm.I have always been great at math.Since I was a child, I excelled in all of my classes.I graduated as valedictorian, and I went on to become a lauded CPA, or so I thought.The other day I was going through some old newspapers that my firm had tucked away...I dont know why an accounting firm would hoard newspapers but I digress.On the front page there was a story about a man who used his massive intellect to inflict pain upon he city.They called the man, The Intellegencia.This super villain was able to use his mind to control computers, and he was capable of using his advanced intellect to stop nearly every hero that came after him.He even managed to kill Cosmo, The Universal Hero (this dude could control the fabric of the universe.He could increase gravity exponentially and even manipulate time.He was powerful).Now I do not usually care about what heroes and villains are doing.For the most part they do not affect my life.But this Intellegencia guy is different.He was wearing a mask, but I can recognize my own eyes from anywhere.This man plastered across the front page is me.Ive heard of a superhero, The Wash, who can wipe peoples minds.He has psychic powers that allow him to control and manipulate people (good thing he is not a villain).He doesnt like to fight.Instead, he uses his powers to wipe the minds of super villains and to set them up with new lives.I always thought it was more decent than killing them or whatever else Supermonger and Ratman do to their villains.But now that I know its happened to me, I dont know how I feel about it anymore.I mean, I like being Geoff.I make a decent salary, and I have a beautiful wife (well she has an overbite but she is a solid 8 out of 10).We are expecting our first child in about three months.If I go down this rabbit hole and try to figure out my past, I could lose all of that.(I wonder if my wife used to be a super villain.Maybe she got bit by a rabbit when she was young and developed steel chomping powers.Seriously, that overbite is crazy).That being said, Id like to know why I was such an evil person.I mean now I dont even squash spiders.I use a cup to take them outside and set them free.How could I have killed people?What would make me do something so horrid?Maybe I can find The Wash and ask him to take away this particular memory.Hed probably do it.It would allow me to just be Geoff and continue on in my life blissfully unaware of the pain I had caused.No, I need to know why I was who I was.This wont change me.I know who I am now.I am a good person, and I know that knowing the full extent of my powers will help me change the world for the better.I am now Geoff, not The Intellegencia, and I will help the world.
