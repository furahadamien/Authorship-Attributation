"My lord, you must understand this is no ordinary spatula."I said 
standing in front of the mighty Odin and his board.How did I even get into this situation?My whole life I have been the mightiest of warriors, fought countless battles, outsmarted the smartest opponents.Yet here I stand, with a spatula in my hand.I suppose in my old age I became complacent.When you've fought as many battles as I have you can get complacent.It has been years since I have been truly challenged.Not only through brute strength, but through wit and intelligence.There is no one who could create a better battle plan than me.I have faced giants and cyclops, 100 times my size.Yet they all fell the same as the smallest man.It was my intelligence and ability to think on the spot that has saved me more times than my sword and it's what will save me now."I see nothing special about this spatula.There is no denying you were a mighty warrior, but your arrogance cost you.Ignoring a call to arms to make an omelette is not honorable.Your ignorance caused you to lower your guard and be killed in your own kitchen."Odin replied."I know it seems that way my lord, but I was not preparing food.I was retrieving my mightiest weapon.You see this is no ordinary spatula.This is a Hydrodynamic Spatula with port and starboard attachments, and let's not forget the turbo drive!"I replied."With this weapon even the mightiest of demons have fallen."The board looked at me dumbfounded, but they hadn't stopped me.This is my only shot and I have to sell this."You see my lord, this is the only one of it's kind in existence.It has been passed down from the descendants of...King Neptune.The mighty guardian of the bottom of the sea.It has been used to feed armies as well as defeat the dreaded...nematodes!"I spat out."You see the nematodes were a dreaded race of creatures.They would travel in packs of hundred and destroy a village by consuming all it's resources.After they were done they would leave the villagers to starve.Until one day, a mighty warrior arose to stop them.The great warrior Bob lord of the Sponge.With his specially square suit and the hydrodynamic spatula with port and starboard attachments..." 

"Don't forget the turbo drive" Interrupted Odin."Yes the turbo drive of course.Well the Lord of the Sponge was able to defeat the entire army and save his village.All done with this weapon.So you see my lord, this is no spatula.This is a weapon fit for a God.The defender of the sea, the protector of village resources, this is the ultimate weapon!"I shouted.The room grew quiet.Odin began to converse in whispers with his advisors.I stood there in silence, my knuckles white gripping this damn spatula."In lieu of this new information the board has decided to allow you entry into Valhalla.As well as take the hydrodynamic spatula, with port and starboard attachments and turbo drive , and keep it in Asgard.It will sit amongst Mjolnir and Gungnir.It will be studied and understood to harness it's power."Odin said.I can't believe this worked.By the time they realize it's just a regular spatula I'll be in Valhalla.Who knows, maybe they can turn it into a weapon.It did just save my life so it can't be all bad."Warrior, we thank you for bringing this power weapon to our attention.With this the armies of Asgard can only get stronger.Now, it is time for you to take your place in Valhalla.Shall we go?"Odin said as he stood from his thrown to guide the way.There was only one thing I could say."I'm ready."
