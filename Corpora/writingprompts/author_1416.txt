I sigh, even though I'm standing in front of these people, they can never sense me nor hear me.They can't feel me either.I was many things as these creatures changed.I used to never exist, but suddenly I was.Their thoughts, feats, fears, and phobias have born something that is called different things at different times.I was there when their gods created them.Their gods didn't make me, they did.Humans.Gods gave them life.Made them in their own image and then left their world to them, without any sort of warning.As these creatures, these humans began walking this earth I studied them.I've seen everyone that's ever lived, and I am the reason they've died.Wars, plagues, accidents, you name it.I am with every human, and as they die, I knew I died with them.Its a weird feeling.Where gods are connected to them in their life, I am connected to them in death.If they go extinct then I too become extinct with them.I feel everything humans do, I feel sadness and rage.I feel happiness and confusion as they do.But at the end of the day, I am Death.I kill them to maintain the balance of the world.But something has changed, the gods have seen fit to destroy their own creations, the vile things!They have lost hope, only a handful of them remain alive.I've had to reap most of them, the gods are cruel to allow this to happen.One woman walks through me and shivers.She could feel the ominous aura I carry.They all feel alone, they all feel sad and confused.One is angry at his god for the destruction of his family...I decided they cant lose hope, not now.They need to survive, I need to survive!Theres a hunting party being formed, I won't allow them to become hunted.I am DEATH itself I will not fail!The party gather, as I gather."Alright, we are running low on fuel, ammo, and food ok?So we need to focus on food, but if you can find gas or oil, or somehow even find guns and ammo you should grab that too.We have picked most of our area clean, but there's still a chance the heart of the city is still left untouched so we gotta go there."A man says."What?Screw off jonny, theres no goddamned way were going there.Remember the last time we took a venture into the city?Huh?Katie, sonny, Jake, and 4 children are gone because of your stupid decision!"Another says.I understand why he is angry though.Those people didn't deserve their deaths they got, I could have killed them less painlessly, if I was stronger.But with there being so little humans left, its not easy to make cardiac arrest just happen anymore."Listen, Paul, I know your mad.But I think we got better odds now, I don't know why its just a gut feeling" jonny says.He is right.They have better odds now because I am going against my code and helping them.Their gods are ethereal just like me, but I will find a way to kill them, to make them pay and suffer in their demise as I am made to suffer and die."Oh that's rich.You got what?6 people and that's the best you can do?A gut feeling?Peoples lives are in jeopardy and you got gut feelings?"Paul walks off.He is going to gather the few people he can and strike out on his own.I sigh, they will become adversaries.A small group broken smaller...I don't have the power to stop them from leaving.With so little humans left, and them being separated like this makes me nigh powerless."Well... You with me?"Johnny asks the other people.They did their heads, unsure what to say to what just happened."Let him cool off Jon.He will change his mind if we bring him something to eat."A woman says.She doesn't know it yet, but she is pregnant.The future of mankind literally is with this woman."Thanks julls.Alright lets get going!"Jonny says as he jumps into the front seat of a vehicle.They begin to speed off.And for a while they forgot the situation they were in.Driving fast down the road, singing silly songs, and the two girls dancing to an unknowable beat.I too forgot the situation.It was blissful.The speed, the carelessness... Oh how much fun I could have!But something brought me back as I could foresee the truck flipping over, the man jonny is going to fall asleep as the girls and the guys flirt and talk about idealistic things and not pay the driver attention.The gods are going to crash the truck and kill everyone.But I react now, grabbing the wheel, jonny falls asleep, but I keep the wheel straight.One girl finally notices and slaps him awake, and I let go, he doesnt seem to have noticed my intervention."What the FUCK jonny?You trying to get everyone killed?"The pregnant woman screeches.Jonny slows down and stops.He gets out, and pukes.The human body isn't capable of handling being toyed with by gods apparently."It wasn't me, Julie I feel fine.I was awake and then suddenly I wasn't.But nevertheless, did you guys notice anything?"One guy says "you were asleep right?But the truck stayed straight.I work on this baby all the time, so I know she pulls to the left, we dont have the parts to replace the bad column.That's weird how it suddenly stayed straight"

"Really?Never noticed"
"Nope"
"You smoking?"The four look back at the guy who spoke first."So what?You think gods are helping us out all of a sudden?"Julie says 

"No, its more probable that something else held the vehicle straight.The gods are trying to extinct us, remember?""Ill bet that's why barfbag suddenly took a power nap.""If not gods then what could have?Spirits?Good luck?""Definitely not the spirits, man, I've seen some in action and they are nasty pieces of work."The second man says."Alright jonny, ill take over."Julie says as she slides into the drivers seat."You get in the bed and try to not throw up everywhere."As she sped off I couldn't help but "smile" at the notion how their conversation was perfectly acceptable.Only a few short years ago and this conversation would have taken place in an asylum.They reached their destination, the city.A plethora of toys, instruments to demise a being with.The gods will try something here, I could sense it.Then the foresight came.A skyscraper will lose its battle to gravity, and win against them.I quickly shut the vehicle off, mustering energy from my consciousness to stall the truck.As the truck coasted and the passengers freaking out, the skyscraper fell, landing harmlessly in front of them.Julie slammed on the breaks, astonished.The two guys and girl were taken aback as well.Johnny slammed against the truck window, rubbing his head.As the people got out of the truck."That's twice in an hour we were saved from certain death by an unexplainable source.What could it be?""Could it be life?"Julie says as she rubbed her stomach, suddenly aware of her little fetus growing."Don't be ridiculous.Life isn't a thing!"Jonny said quickly dismissing it

"Jonny, consider the fact that gods are actually real.And trying to kill you.Would it be so hard to accept that life is a real thing?You just saw how we survived two certain things that have no real explaination."Julie looks to jonny as he gets out of the truck, and spits blood on the ground, "at any rate" he says, ignoring Julie."We aren't going this way, maybe 'life' could open us a way so we can get food, and not starve to death?"I find these humans amiable.I get another foresight.This time it is some creatures made by their gods, they are called beta voidlings.Individually they are little more than nuisances, but in large numbers like they are in, they become very powerful."Hear that?Jonny there's betas coming!""I see them coming from the west street!""Jenny, start the truck!Jimmy grab a rifle and get in the bed of the truck!Julie you need to get in the truck and lock the doors and windows!"Johnny yells

I shake my head.I focus my conscious into the truck and start it without anyone inside it.All 5 of the humans are shocked, scared, and very very grateful."Thanks life!"Everyone says as they get in the truck and speed off.Since then, anything good that happens to a human is considered a gift from life, and anything bad is considered a curse from god.I sigh, as I stand in front of these people and they don't know that I really am just death.
