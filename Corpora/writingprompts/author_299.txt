Sciphio
I just can't figure it out!I've come to you as the richest man in the world!I know, but money isn't what interests me.What about the time I came to you as a sexy exotic model and displayed my ideal physique to you??Oh yeah, those abs were rocking and wow you did look really good but again, eye candy is just that.Why didn't it work out when I flung myself at you as the world's smartest man?The appearance of intelligence was very very tempting but after I got to know you a bit I knew it was a sham.What do you want then??How can I make you mine?!You can't.It will work on the many shallow people out there but not me.I actually take time to know the person behind the cover.All you can do is change your cover and title which is of little value to me.The shapeshifter processes what he was told and slowly shows himself for who he is.A blob of mercurial liquid.He gains his composure and delivers his last shot at the woman of his desires.My name is John and I apologize for assuming that you where shallow.Can we give this one more try?Now, I think we can.Really?!Yes, this can actually work now.As they embrace in celebration of a new relationship a tear trickles down from the woman's perfect eyes.A tear that looks mercurial as the shapeshifter.
