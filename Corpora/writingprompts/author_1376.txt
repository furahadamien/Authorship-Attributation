"How did it go?"They asked.I could only utter a weak "what?"when the doctor interjected "he might not recognize us for a while, give him some time to rest."What am I doing here?The last thing I remember...There was a hospital bed, the sound of the monitor, Mary and the boys, everything fading out..Crying?Was that all a dream?How could it?I remember everything so vividly.Why am I here?I can feel an aching, pulsing feeling in my legs.Wh-what?!Where are they?!?!HELP HELP WHATS HAPPENED TO ME?!!!Nurses rush in to find me shrieking at the too of my lungs "I REMEMBER!!I REMEMBER NOW!!I SHOULD HAVE DIED!!!""We had to sedate you Walter."I wake up to what looks like three nurses and a doctor."You were dying Walter.Your legs were beyond saving, we couldnt stop the bleeding.You kept shouting 'Not like this, please, PLEASE not like this' so we administered the tocindact."
