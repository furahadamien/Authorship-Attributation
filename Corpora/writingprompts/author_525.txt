The Pope knelt inside the cool, grey dark of the nave.He was a man with a simple, strong faith and he felt both troubled and blessed this morning.God had come, and He had both measured and spoken.A genuinely supernatural event.But the act had felt both capricious and strange.God had used the medium of #1 Dad mugs.This seems neither a godly medium or act till you are confronted by The Work.Then realisation dawns.You feel awe.The power you confront is complete and total.Ultimate.These mugs, every single one in the world, currently displayed a message "This is how good a father you truly are" and a number in some long-dead or never-existing language though this posed no imposition.The words hammered an understanding into your head and into the depths of your soul.The numbers were true and certain.This you knew."Job," whispered the Pope nervous."Like Job."He bowed his head though he did not pray and he thought on God, his power and his plans, and he thought on his sins and his number #20,000,001 and thought on the sins of his flock, every single lamb, and he worried for the world.The Pope began to pray and his prayers were many and strange.
