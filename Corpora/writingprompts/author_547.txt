"This just can't be right!"Daddy said with a shriek."My mug has read '#1 Father' all week!Perhaps I may not be the finest alive,

But nine million twelve thousand six eighty-five?!"\


"But daddy," said Jimmy."You're first in my heart.""Shut up, boy!Not now," Daddy said with a start.And just when he thought that he'd taken his licks,

The mug readjusted: Twelve Ten Sixty-Six.\

"I'm sorry," said Daddy, a tear in his eye."I love you so much, I may even just cry."But his rank's quick decline was definitive proof

That the mug could with ease tell a lie from the truth.\

And just as it passed the three billion mark,

Jimmy had his own realization quite stark."You don't even like me!You hate me, you do."The reply: "Don't I know it.You're an accident, too."\

And finally the number took one final dive.Stopped just past six billion and seventy-five.This was the end.He just couldn't go lower.With each bated breath his heart beat a bit slower.\

"Oh, no," Daddy said."Jimmy, What have you done?You'd better run fast now.I'm fetching my gun.For surely my rank will no longer appall

If e'er I'm no longer a father at all."\

And fetch it he did.And Jimmy ran fast.But finally Daddy caught Jimmy at last."Its over.You're done for.It's the end of your rope."But Jimmy, a brave boy, ne'er relinquished his hope.\

He swept his dad's leg, never missing a beat.But as the man fell, Jimmy too left his feet.The gun so fell too and as all hit the ground

Instinct took over.The whole world lost its sound.\

The boy grabbed the gun and with little delay,

A clear shot rang out through the clear summer's day.Looking up from the ground, the barrel still hissing,

He noticed the back of his father's skull missing.\

The boy fled the scene, spattered blood on his shirt.He'd expected that killing his father would hurt.But now it was done he just couldn't feel bad.When he looked at the mug it read "World's Worst Dad."
