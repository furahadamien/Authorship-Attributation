As I wake up, I lie on my pile of fabrics fighting the urge to open my eyes, just as I have done for the past 741 sleeps.Even after all this time, the disappointment remains.I never realized before The Great Blinding how much I needed color, how much I would miss the pink of his lips or the brown and honey flecks in his emerald irises.I didnt consider how much I would miss the neon red and blue that accompanied the ever-present rhythmic hum of the vacancy sign in front of the hotel room we were in when darkness hit us all.Eyes still closed, I can smell the twenty three other people crowding the hotel lobby.I hear Stephens low snore like the hum of a bee stuck in a mason jar.I hear the buzz of the vacancy sign.My fingers wander up the pile of fabric to brush my hair off my face.Between the layers of denim, cotton, and burlap, my fingertips find the soft silk scarf I carefully place by my head each time I go to sleep.I try so hard to imagine the scarf dancing with color bright blues and greens swirling behind red floral bursts.Maybe the scarf is purple with gold Greek-style trim like ancient royalty.Maybe its a silk print of Van Goghs starry night and Ive been sleeping atop the swirls of the stars Ive so missed.It hurts to remember sight but I have to.I have to hold onto it.I cannot forget color and curves and faces.The feeling of the silk pushes me, as it has at every awakening since I found it over a year ago, to just try.Just try to see.On the count of three Ill open my eyes.One 

Two

Three

Slowly I open them and look around.Am I fooling myself?Have I lost my mind?Is my imagination playing tricks on me?Its dim but I can make out shapes.I can see colors!With the rhythmic hum of the vacancy sign the room grows a blue glow through the large wall of windows at the front of the hotel lobby.By the 5th blue glow, my eyes are beginning to adjust.Thats when I see it: DONT LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE.Its written on every wall.Its written on the windows.Panic quickly replaces the awe Ive just been washed with.I close my eyes hard.Open them.The scene remains.Slam my eyes closed.Open them.No change.Once more I close my eyes.The darkness is comforting for the first time in two years.With eyes tightly clenched and breath held firmly in my lungs, I reach my hand towards the sound of Stephens gentle snores.I can feel his face.The stiff but soft hair on his cheek pacify me.Whats the matter, sunshine? whispers Stephens soothing, still-sleepy voice.I finally exhale.Its nothing.I got startled.Im fine now I keep my eyes closed as I run my fingers the length of his beard once more.I open my eyes again and my gaze falls toward my finger tips.The fear and panic immediately return.I feel dizzy.I feel nauseated.I cant catch my breath.It isnt Stephen at all.It isnt even a human.Whatever it is, I cannot let it know I can see.
