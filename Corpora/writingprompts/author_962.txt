First, a little background.My name is Chad and I'm thirty years old.I'm a respected scientist of a well known college.My area of expertise was the human brain.I was never really a religious man, I had always put my faith in science.Although I was a man firmly planted in what I perceived as reality, I was not such a terrible father as to keep my daughter from the childish belief of Santa Claus and the joy of receiving gifts on Christmas.My tale starts on the night of December 20th."Daddy please please please!I promise I'll get rid of some of my toys if you pwomise to get me a pony this year!"My daughter had recently developed an obsession with horses after I brought her to a show at the county fair.I watched on as she stared at the horses prancing up and down the arena with her jaw nearly touching the floor, and her eyes filled with the utmost wonderment.I sat there for what could have been either five minutes or an eternity smiling at my precious princess.I had never seen her so happy!The thought didn't occur to me what I had just gotten myself into until I heard her murmur "I wish I was a cowgirl..." 

 Now I love my daughter dearly and would do anything for her, but sadly due to some lapses in judgement at work, I was put on unpaid probation for the good part of a year.Money was tight, housing was expensive, and I had piled up a couple debts I couldn't afford to pay off right away.You could say I had a bit of a gambling problem.Well I guess you could say I had a tremendous gambling problem, which ultimately wounded up in me being a single father.I mean yes, my ex wife might have lost her beautiful wedding ring, but I was certain I could get us a yacht!It began as a frequent mentioning of how beautiful horses were and how fast they could move."Daddy daddy did you know horses can run as fast as a go cart?Daddy did you know that horses love apples!Hey, we have an apple tree in the backyard!Our horsey could just eat those!"Wow honey that's incredible!Well I'm sure the pony would love the apples but I'm not sure there's enough room in our backyard for a horsey!These conversations went on for a couple nights and then the dreaded temper tantrums started.I want a horse!I want a horse!She would scream over and over until she couldn't scream anymore, then she would cry.That's when I had what I believed to be my brilliant idea."Honey if you really want a horse you should write Santa a letter!If Santa thinks your pony would enjoy living in our backyard he'll bring you one!She must have spent all night on that letter, which she would not let me read in case Santa somehow worked like birthday wishes and didn't show up if the wish wasn't a secret.Around 8:30 I walked into my pumpkins room and said lights out!She handed me the envelope that contained her masterpiece before giggling excitedly saying "make sure you put this in the mailbox!"I kissed her on the forehead as I tucked her into bed, "of course I will, goodnight sweets I love you!I glanced at the envelope and had myself a laugh as I noticed the simple error on the envelope."To Satan!!"With many smiley faces and hearts covering the entirety of the envelope.I decided I would leave the letter on the counter and put it away with the other memorabilia of my angel.I awoke the next day to find that the letter was not where I left it.In its place lied a pile of ash.I quickly cleaned it up and went to ask my daughter if she had mailed the letter herself, she told me she thought I did last night.In order to prevent the onslaught of tears I said oh yes honey that's right I was so tired I forgot I had.The doorbell rings and in walks the nanny.I was offering to pay her double since it was so close to the holidays.She smiled sweetly and said she would take no money at all."Being with this....... angel... is payment enough!She said.I knew something seemed off about her today, but I was in too much of a rush to pay much attention.I returned to an empty house and began frantically calling the nanny just trying to check on my sweets.I was answered by a raspy and tired hello Mr. Foster I'm sorry I won't be able to watch Charolette this week, I'm afraid I've come down with a nasty flu.My head started spinning as I started screaming what do you mean you were here this morning tell me where my daughter is or I'm calling the police!She told me I should go and talk to a psychologist.I was on the verge of screaming every vulgarity my worn out mind could muster when I heard the whinnying of a horse coming from the backyard.I dropped my phone and ran to the back.There stood the most magnificent creature I have ever seen.A stunning black horse with blue flames where the mane and tail should have been, attached to it was two envelopes.One being the note my daughter had written, the other was a red velvet envelope.In that very instant I realized the Devil was more than real.I open the envelope and read, Dear Mr. Foster, I do believe there was a mixup and perhaps that letter was written for someone else, but it's not everyday I get a young soul writing to me, basically asking to sign a contract.I mean I am the Devil after all!Anyways your daughter wanted a horse with fire coming out of its neck, or perhaps that was the poor wretched child's attempt at drawing a mane and tale.If I've learned anything about your family, well let's just say it's good you're a scientist and not an artist.So your daughter wanted a horse, I wanted a soul.Now I may have used a slight bit of trickery in order to obtain her soul.Good thing the young ones have a loose grip on diction am I right!?Haha well I guess you can assume what happened!I can't say I'm looking forward with corresponding with you again, Mr macho science guy, so I bid thee farewell and good luck with the rest of your life!Enjoy the pony and mind the flames!Would be a pain to have your crotch lit up by a blue flame.Those are much hotter than the red ones.Yours truly, Lucifer.Read the bottom line.I sat and cried for hours and hours until I realized something.A being as dishonest, corrupt, and evil as him, must have a bit of a gambling problem!I decided to grab a pen and paper and write my letter.It read

Dear Mr lucifer, you have taken something near and dear to me, and I would like to talk business with you, please come visit me as soon as possible.As I put the last letter of Mr. Foster down the letter disappeared and left behind a pile of ash.I turned around to see Lucifer.He was not at all how the fairy tales describe him as a menacing red beast with an arrow tail.He was a tall man with broad shoulder.His hair was black as night and combed neatly in a pompadour.His cheeks were gaunt, but in a handsome way.His cleft chin was perfectly proportionate and retained a stubble of a beard.Hello Mr Foster he said in a voice that was too smooth and charismatic for the devil.Well I ought to say you are vastly different than I imagined I said.He wore a beautiful silk suit perfectly fit and free of wrinkles.He definitely seemed like the business type."Well I wouldn't be the master of temptation if I wasn't magnificent!"He exclaimed.He's definitely a tad bit arrogant."Fair enough."I responded. "you have taken my most beloved thing in this world.I would do anything to win her back."Why win her back when you can trade your soul for hers?Are you so willing to gamble and lose both?How do you know I was going to gamble?I asked
I know the look of a man about to throw his life away for a chance" he responds."So what is your wager?If I lose, you can take my soul with my daughter, if I win you must return my daughter to me and never bother us again."He thought for a moment before a smile broke out over his face.Of course we can do that!What shall we play then, poker?I turned to him and laughed.I already won.A look of bewilderment came across his face.I asked him to retrieve the letter I had sent him and he presented it.I retrieved a vial containing a clear liquid from my desk drawer.What the devil is that?Holy water?!He screamed.Haha no sir I've never been a man of god so I can't say I have any holy artifacts.I am however an established scientist who has made numerous discoveries not everyone is ready to hear yet.So I write the majority of my observations in invisible ink.I set the letter on the table and in the "blank" space I painted the clear liquid.The invisible ink then appeared and read "I gamble that I will get you to agree to gambling.I win.Ps: acceptance of this gamble allows us to keep the pony, just replace the fire with hair please.Lucifer had gone completely pale."You sir, are the devil!"He screamed.Well a gamble is a gamble Mr. Foster.He snaps his finger and tells me to check my daughters room.I walk in to see my angel sleeping peacefully and return to the living room.Well Mr. Foster you have got your wish.I know your past, and I look forward to having you as a team member when your time has come.Not many people can say they've tricked the devil.I bid thee farewell!With another snap of his fingers he vanished.Bastard didn't change the horses fiery mane and there was  a new note on the horse.You didn't say I had to change the horse, you simply asked very politely.Although I appreciate the respectful tone, I'm gonna go ahead and take this victory PS fuck you man.
