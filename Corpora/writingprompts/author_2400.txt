Intellectual disagreement.Through reason one can reach the highest truths.Actions for the greater good.Arriving at the most desired end through the most effective means.The philosophy of the Zeth'Kan order was a force that could move mountains.Huang Xile was the embodiment of that philosophy as he strode through the arena.He was chosen as the power-wielder of Zeth'Kan.Wielding that power, he now used it to crush the skull of Shere Yuanshan, champion of the Pan'Thak people.Screams of horror arose from the onlookers as they watched their strongest power-wielder fall in the duel.Or at least Huang Xile calculated that horror would be the most likely sentiment.He could not be sure and would therefore not argue the case.Dropping the limb body of Shere Yuanshan, Huang Xile turned around precisely the moment the rest of the Pan'Thakian power-wielders would be close enough to grasp, yet not close enough to hurt him.The look in their eye changed as he did.Huang Xile estimated it to be due to dismay that their plan had failed.If they had reasoned as he they would have known that it would fail.If they had not split up the power in between all of them they would not have been divided and conquered.If they had reasoned as he they would not build their society upon justice, charity and kindness.If they had reasoned as he their subjective morality would not blind them from the truth.Huang Xile hoisted the dying breed of power-wielding Pan'Thakians into the air with the power of Zeth'Kan."Monster!""Slaughterer!""Fiend!"They cursed at Huang Xile before he ended them with a swat of the hand.The duel had been a necessary means to draw out the Pan'Thak elite.The Zeth'Kan order had agreed that it would be the most efficient way of crushing Pan'Thak resistance was to disarm them of their national fervor and create hopelessness among the populace.Should the champions fall, the brothers had estimated it would take 20-30 years to convert them to Zeth'Kan belief with all other factors accounted for.Huang Xile watched as the Pan'Thak people fled from the arena.It was well that they had chosen to flee and live rather than to resist and die.The order would need every able hand to work their due to summon Zeth into this world.And with the arrival of Zeth, the Zeth'Kan order would finally know the greatest truth.
