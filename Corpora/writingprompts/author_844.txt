"At last.After years of planning we finally have you in our grasps."The masked figure said."Listen, it wasn't my fault you got caught Charles."our hero replied."Why are you even mad at me.I haven't seen you since college."The masked figure clearly looked angry to be called by his name."We were supposed to be best friends Steve" Charles responded, his voice cracking."But you just kept letting them go.Big ones, little ones, all of them."Steve looked up, seeing outlines of a group of men through the burlap sack covering his face."Charles, I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.Let me go, Jennifer gets mad when I'm late for dinner."Charles ripped his mask off, visibly shaking with anger."HOW DARE YOU SPEAK HER NAME" he shouted, "SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MINE, BUT EVERY TIME SHE SAW A SPIDER YOU JUST SWOOPED IN AND RELEASED IT OUTSIDE."Steve laughed."You kidnapped me, spent god knows how much on henchman, a van?this building" Steve was having a hard time speaking through his laughter, "BECAUSE I DIDNT KILL SPIDERS IN OUR SHITTY COLLEGE APARTMENT?"Charles ripped the bag off, and grabbed Steve by the shirt."ITS SO MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT."Charles reached for the pistol on his hip, "JENNIFER DIDNT THINK I WAS A MAN BECAUSE I NEVER GOT TO KILL THE SPI..." Charles was interrupted by the sound of a faint voice through a megaphone."I wouldn't do that my friend" the voice calmly said.Charles looked around and the two college interns he had brought along."Who said that??"Charles continued, "SHOW YOURSELF!"A garage door slowly opened, revealing an army of spiders and one weird homeless man who looked incredibly confused."Okay" Charles said, staring directly at the camera."I get the plot, man spares spiders, spiders save man" Charles pointed to the homeless man, "but what the bloody hell is he supposed to be doing."A voice off screen yells cut, and a sharp dressed man approaches Charles."Listen, Marvel would only give us licensing rights to the word Spider if we gave Tobey Maguire a roll."The director replied."We weren't expecting him to take Tom getting the new role this badly."Charles rips the mask off, "Alright, this is the last time I work with a director who spends all his time on Reddit" he said, angrily walking off camera.
