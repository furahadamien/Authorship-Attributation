*Do not look at the moon.* *Do not look at the moon.* *Do not forget, do not look at the moon.* 
The little black haired girl darted though the empty unlit street, repeating those words in her head.Struggling to breathe as she ran as fast as her legs could take her.She had to get to the top of the hill no matter what, she couldn't stop, she couldn't waste any time.Something flew past her cheek, barely missing her.A rock, but she couldn't afford to stop.She had to keep running.More rocks flew hitting her in the arms, legs, and chest.Wincing in pain, she continued, planting one foot at a time on the ground.She could see the top of the hill in the distance, giving her a glimmer of hope.Another rock flew out of nowhere and struck her shoulder.*pop.* She cried out in pain and dropped her phone to the ground.The faint light of her phone had not stop glowing, filled with messages telling her "it's a beautiful night tonight, Look outside."She swiped her phone from the ground, and kept running.Each breath was a dagger to her chest, but she couldn't stop.Not now, not when she was so close.She could hear the rocks clattering to the floor after the struck her.The pain was dull, she couldn't be distracted.There a faint panting noise behind her.She felt a cold shiver of terror run down her spine.*Not now.* She was running at her limit, her gasps for air have turned to wheezing.She had now started to run into the grass.The top of the hill was within her reach.Her vision started to fade, and exhaustion hit her like a wall.She couldn't give up now she had to keep going.The light of the moon lit her skin, revealing dark smears of blood and dirt covering her body.Her legs felt heavy, as she struggled to put one foot to another.The panting was getting louder and louder.She knew he was close.Her body jolted with the last bit of adrenaline that it could muster, still hoping she would make it to the top of the hill.Barely conscious, but she kept running.She felt a hand brushing her back, trying to grab her.She only had a few more steps to go.Her legs burned, struggling up the incline of the hill.She was so close."BAM!"She saw the world start to turn.A rock had hit her at the base of her neck and head.Slowly she fell to the ground.She had reached the top of the hill.Had she made it?A icy chill overwhelmed her senses as a shadowy figure loomed over her body.She couldn't move, he arms and legs had been battered and worn to the bone.She tried to scream, but all the running had taken her breath away.She could see his lips moving, but the ringing in her ears concealed any words he may have said."You...you promised," she whimpered."You said if I made it.... if it made it to the top of the hill, I could be free."She tried to crawl away, the gate was so close.A large foot suddenly stomped onto her deformed shoulder.When she cried out in pain, she could see a cruel smile form on his face.A voice like a snake crept through the ringing in her ears."You will be free."She felt a sudden blow to her head that sent a shock rippling through her body.Facing the sky she could see the soft flow of the moon, so high up in the sky, so far from this place.It was beautiful.So beautiful.She felt herself fading.She could feel herself forgetting.Sinking.Sinking.Sinking into the abyss.There was only darkness."Welcome to Luna!Where you can experience your hearts desire!"Huge crowds wandered about the large center.A laughing couple walked into the instructional room their chosen game.Moonlight: Hunt through the Night.The room was filled with other competitors.The television screen lit up and a voice spoke."Welcome, to Moonlight.Where you will hunt a prey of your choice.You may use any weapon that you may come across, but if they make it past the gate you will be eliminated!Here at Luna we value your safety.So if a prey becomes too combative, draw their attention to the moon.The moon in our simulation will wipe their memory and restore their settings.As a second form of safety, you may text the key words 'it's a beautiful night outside, look outside' to this number; this will reset the game.It should be noted that we have recently been encountering a glitch with this feature, that we are working to resolve.As such if you would like to leave the game, the exit will be opposite to the hill and gate.Happy hunting!"
