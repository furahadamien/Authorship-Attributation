"I don't think you're fit for our company, James," a man in simple clothing said, making circles on the spot."And why do you think so?"he asked a question that he knew the answer to already.He mostly tried to keep shaking in check, but he knew that he couldn't just let them run over him."You've worked 8 months here, yet I don't see the sparkles in your eyes.You have every other quality, but it doesn't help when you can't be profitable."James nodded.The whole meeting had been nodding.Even as his brain was generating millions of excuses, he knew that his boss was right."This will be your last chance, James.Don't fail this project," the man stood up and walked away, leaving James alone in the room."Fuck me," James said, leaning backward and looking at the ceiling.He had so many other dreams, but yet he was stuck there.It was as his boss told him.He had every quality, except the actual work itself.He was the motivator and talker.He was active, and people overall loved him.But that wasn't enough since he couldn't work any profit.And even if he tried hard to change that, it either killed his own energy, or he still got some stupid work from his project managers.Endless non-billable bug fixes, or warranty work.But none of that changed the fact that he hated his life.He seemed happy, he looked satisfied, but the truth was something very different.He began thinking about his career, trying to find where it had gone wrong, and why it was so.And then he reached his childhood, remembering how he had gone through some traumas and how he had lost his best friend.But even after all of that, he had tried to push forward.That is until he found the moment in his life when he remembered how everything changed.It wasn't like a significant change, but his life felt different."The VR goggles!"he muttered to himself.But as he thought about it, he never remembered removing the goggles.He had put it on and just walked away.Why didn't he remove them?He put his hands near his eyes and tried to grab something.He felt something physical, which was creepy.He counted to three and pulled that something away, closing his eyes."So?"a voice echoed into his ears.It was a familiar voice.It was a voice he still remembered."How was it?"James opened his eyes and saw Sam sitting in front of him, eyes beaming, ready to consume any feedback he was about to share."Sam?""What?""Is that you?"James asked, eyes slowly watering up."Hey?What's wrong?"Sam asked."You died.""What?Me?Did you fall asleep while playing?Wait?Was it that realistic?"James looked down at the goggles, still visibly seeing the very same meeting room he was in, except that the game seemed to have paused."Was it really that real?"Sam asked."I want to try!Give, give!"James shook his head and stood up.He walked to his desk and began opening his drawers.And he found it.A simple hammer.The reason why he had hammer was a different story, but he knew he had one.Without a second thought, he began hitting the goggles as hard as he could.They could hear how some sparkles flew out and it made a horrible sound, but James kept hitting it as hard as he could.He wa a lot weaker as a 10-year old boy, but he kept doing it."What are you doing?"Sam said, face a bit pale.He stood up and ran to James, hands holding his head."They were expensive!I had to ask my dad for like months.And I wanted to try them too."James, however, laughed as he destroyed it."I already got my best birthday present, ever," he said."Really?And what's that?""You, my best friend, you."----

Years... No, it took *decades* of real preparation.They say that to honor your god is to make the ultimate thing.Once you manage to do that *thing*, they will bless you.There were many gods.Many.But none of them mattered to John.For John, there was only one true god.And just thinking of rewards made him giggle, and try even harder.They all told him it's impossible; that it was stupid and insane.Even his wife finally abandoned him.But that was okay.After all, he didn't.He stayed with him.At first, he took out his phone to record it.But there came the point when he lived his life with GoPro basically clued to his forehead.He needed the proof.Justin Case - that's the man who collected the proof to finally respond with blessing.He was the one who held the original book.And until he gets that proof, he will try hard.*And that day came.*

"Come here, Palmerranian!"John said, looking at his dog, Pomeranian "We are gonna do more than that Pea did.More than the true god's dog.You know what, Palmerranian?What's god backward?Dog!Exactly.Nobody else can see!But together, we will do it!"He took out the glass and filled it with water.The dog stayed still, watching him, ready.His tale was as excitedly swirling as ever.But for once he really looked ready.John put the glass water on Palmerranian's head, making him take fifteen steps backward and then forward.And he did it.*For once, he did it.*

Tears began to gather.He fell on his knees, just to hear the glass shatter and the dog running towards his master."I did it," he muttered."I will get the blessings of our god!"But the dog groaned and stopped, falling down."Palm?"John muttered, looking at the dog, running to him.He was bleeding.The dropped glass's shard had cut him.Immediately he grabbed the dog, rushing towards the room's exit."Anything but my dog!"John shouted, screamed.But he could feel it.The dog was licking his face, barking a few times.He stopped and put him down, just to see the dog sitting and looking at him, waiting for that glass of water on his head.The usual pose, ready to please the master."You... You did this just because you want to make me happy?Even when you bleed?"John muttered, falling on his knees the second time and ripping off his GoPro, looking at it, wanting to throw it away.But he couldn't."At least we are getting a lot of views on youtube," John said, kissing the dog.(/r/Elven <- I write psychological fiction.Cheers <3!Love your doggos!Like I love Palmerranian!)
