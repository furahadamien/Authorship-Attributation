TheShatteredWill
That bastard.That absolute slime ball.I wasn't about to let him get away with this?He embezzled over 50,000 dollars of charity money to put into his account, and he made me help him do it.How could I of been so blind?No matter.All I knew was that he would pay up.Big time.See.. the big perk of being rich is that I could be whatever the hell I wanted to be.I shuffled the olive around in my martini as I took a long drawn out sip.The tips of my dark black stilettos clicked like a clock as I contemplated my scheme.My blood red lips curved into a suggestive smile.&#x200B;

It was about midnight I was closing up shop as I normally did.I was a multi-billionaire.Whats 50,000 more?It would look like a minor transaction into my hands.No offshore accounts, no nosy FBI agents.... and no annoying do gooder secretaries.It was a good thing I got rid of her.She was a disposable pawn.And she fell for it.Under the guise of true love.I was considered a good looker to most, but to her it seemed like I could do no wrong.Falling for every little thing.The roses.The chocolates.Hell, even the rooftop kiss.It was so forced and bitter to me.But the way her tiny delicate hands wrapped around my neck, her rosy red lips, (bright in comparison to her milk white skin), seemed to thaw my heart for a moment.But in reality what could ever come of it?He was an icy money driven snake of a man.And he was proud of it.Many of his adversaries called him Lucifer because of how cruel he was at times.But he always got away with it.Something tugged at the edge of his consciousness.The limp weakling left of a Jiminy Cricket was trying to tell him that something was off.But he hasn't ever listened to him before.Why should he now?A loud crash drew his attention away from his thoughts.He ran out of his office to see that the glass pane that held a memorial of himself, (founder of the company), was shattered all over the floor."Shit....that was expensive...what the hell did thi-..." He stopped short.Among the broken glass, in a beam of the dingy, smogged moonlight sat a single red rose.Chills ran up and down his spine like electricity in a live wire.That fear turned into utter rage.There was only one person that could of done this."Where are you?I know its you.Theres no one else that could use such ironic and childish symbolism."He lied to himself.He always kept a cool outer exterior, but on the inside he was terrified like a child of the boogeyman that hid in his closet.A dark chuckle came from directly above him.A figure flew down and landed on the railing in front of him.The shock knocked him on his ass, where he cut his hands in the tiny shards of glass.The figure turned.Almost demonic in posture.The stood only about 5 feet in height, but on either side of them stood out leathery dragon like wings.The monster glared at him with bright red glowing eyes, perched on top of a monstrous snout that was like that of a wolf.A deep growl penetrated the silence.Huge fangs that lined the beasts jaws dripped with drool as the gaping maw of its mouth opened to an almost 180 degree angle.A forked tongue darted out, tasting the air.It rose up to full height, which was about 10 feet now.A long scaly tail ending with a tip that resembled a fantasy machete that he owned.Sparks flew across the floor as it swished back and forth with an ear grinding sound."Wh...wht do you want??"He asked.The creature closed his gaping mouth and grinned.A grin so wide that it would make the Grinch himself quiver in fear."Revenge."Came a completely normal voice from behind him.She smiled brightly as her black heels clicked over the glass.She crossed to the creature, stroking its muzzle like a puppy dog."Did you really think that you could get away with double crossing me?Really?"She laughed in a chillingly empty tone.Without turning to him she cooed to the monster 

"So..what will we do to him if he doesn't comply with our demands?"A cross between chortled laughter from a hyena, the howl of a wolf, the guttural growl of an alligator and a noise from the inner depths of hell rang in the empty office walls."Wh...what do you want...?"He whimpered.She smiled.A smile so pleasant that it made him sick to his stomach."Simple.Give up your fortune, admit to your crimes.Hell, there are many ways.." He doesn't know how, or if he blinked for an hour.But he was in the office writing a long note.The desktop glowing in his face only allowed him to see the red eyes staring at him from the darkness as he typed.Her hands were all over him.Tracing up and down his back, messing with the short frocks of hair at the base of his neck with her delicate china doll fingers.Even her soft raspy breath grazed his ears as she read over his shoulders.3 hours passed."Looks good to me."She said abruptly.I printed it off and stapled the 50 page admittance to my crimes.She set it carefully on my desk.Looking me in the eyes, she grabbed my shirt collar and kissed me with such a passion that it almost knocked me off of my feet.As she pulled back, licking her cherry red lips, 

"I am going to miss that about you."She turned walking away.The red eyes closed and dissapeared with her.All that was heard was, click click click click, thump thump, click click click click, thump thump.A sigh of relief washed over him."Thank god....they're gone.." I took the papers and set them on fire in the wastebasket.No one had to know.I took a deep shuddering breath.I turned off my laptop and faced the darkened doorway.Nothing there.I went downstairs, and into the parking garage.The lights all went out with a sizzling screech.2 sounds echoed off of the walls that made me fumble for my keys, and realize.They wernt in my pocket.Click....click....click.....click... thump......thump.....

"Missing Something?"The sound of jingling keys.
