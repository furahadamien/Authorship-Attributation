I arrive at the building my old friend told me his office was at and find myself looking up at a towering skyscraper piercing into the sky of Anchorage, Alaska.I duck my head down, put my hands in my winter jacket as I feel the cold biting on my fingertips, and enter the building.Immediately, I am face to face with a six foot two hundred pound plus Pacific Islander security guard, whose desk is in the large arctic entry with the second doors right behind him."Can I help you?""Yeah, my friend Killian works here.I'm Mika, an old friend of his,  I was trying to see him about something..."

 "Ok", he says as he starts scanning a paper on his desk."Ah!I need to ask you a challenge question before I'm allowed to let you in, hope you don't mind?"I indicate that I don't mind and he grunts."Alright.When and where did you first have sex with Killian?""Really!?That's the question?"I ask, flustered.He holds up a slip of paper that does indeed have that question on it."Fine.We meet at University at the Halloween dance the campus freshman dorms put on and we danced.We clicked and were having a grand time with each other.One thing led to another and he took me to his dorm room where we did the deed.Can I see my friend now?"He grunts, presses a button, the doors behind him open and he nods towards them.I smile, quickly walking by him and see that he has never moved his right arm from under the desk, darting further inside the building.Killian had said that if I ever visited him here, be prepared and that his office was the top floor.I stared at the scene in front of me as I looked around.It was one big atrium with giant glass ceilings and all around different vegetation grew in the courtyard I found myself in.There were a few people milling about and others sitting at tables out here.I found the elevator and made my way over to it.I presses the up button and waited.Up on arriving, it opened to reveal two white Russian guys, or at least that's what I assumed with the track suit getup and their physical characteristics, both with assault rifles on their shoulders."Miss, which floor you want?""Top floor."I squeaked."Hmmm.Your name and business with boss?""Mika.I'm a friend of his and needed to talk to him."He looks at the other guy,  who had stayed quiet, who nods to the questioner after listening to his earpiece.He waves me into the elevator which is wide and deep enough for a couch to fit without having to turn or tilt it if sideways.I step into it and he presses the button for the top floor after the other guy puts the elevator key in and turns it.We ride up to the top in silence, giving me plenty of time to stare at my reflection.The bell dings and the doors open.There is Killian, standing with a huge grin on his face."Mika!It's so lovely to see you again.What brings you to pay a visit on your old friend?""I was at a robbery yesterday.The robbers said I'm on some kind of no kill list.I wanted to find out how that came to be so I came to visit you."He nods, takes my hand and takes us to a couch in front of a huge window overlooking the entire city."Please don't abuse it.Only a select few are granted such a thing and it is only good as long as I'm around.I did it because I still love you and don't want you to die from some idiot shooting people."I blush and look away for a moment."I don't know what to say...thank you."He nods and then I hear glass being hit and look out to see a bullet having just hit the window.Three more quickly follow, then a fourth and I feel blood spraying across my face.I look over in horror to see glazed eyes and a hole in Killian's head...
