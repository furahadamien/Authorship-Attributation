"Next!"shouted Lugia.Three rows of chairs sat before him, each holding a potential recruit into their league.He could tell at a glance what a few of the powers before him were; the man on fire and the woman floating two inches above her chair were gimmes.A few of the others, like the woman with the glowing eyes and the man with the power armour, would be interesting to find out, but most of the candidates looked like perfectly normal people.One of the inconspicuous ones stepped forward next; unlike the others, he had a frown on his face."Your name, sir?"Lugia inquired."My name?I'm Bill."the man responded."And what will be your superhero name?"Lugia continued, with a flare for the dramatic.He had always been something of a performer, and gaining powers had given him the perfect opportunity to overact (as he had always desired)."I don't have one," was the response."Look, can I," he began, before Lugia cut him off."No name?Then we will have the honour of naming you!Tell us good sir, what is your power?"Lugia had loved naming new capes ever since he screwed up his own choice so badly."Every time that guy stops time," he began, pointing at Destiny, "my time stops as well.It's become a serious issue, alright?"Lugia looked over at Destiny, who had a puzzled look on his face.A moment later, both Destiny and "Bill" had changed their standing positions.Destiny looked intrigued, but Bill's annoyed look had only strengthened, if possible."Amazing!"cried Lugia.The possibilities of this were endless."Can you copy the powers of anyone else?""Well, I'm not on fire, so I'm guessing no," replied Bill, looking wearily at his neighbour in the crowd."Hmm, well, it's not the strongest power in existence, but we could certainly find a use for it..." Lugia mused."What?No, I have no interest in using it.I would just like some warning when it's about to happen.The sixth time it happened, the bike I was pedalling stopped, throwing me over the handlebars.I was bruised for weeks.Imagine if I had been driving!Or taking a train.I'd be dead!By the way, fire your secretary, she called me a crank when I phoned her up.I had to walk over here to get an audience!"
