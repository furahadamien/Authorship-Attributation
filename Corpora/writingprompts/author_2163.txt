Blood, sweat and facepface paint.Disgusting.If there was one thing Gravitor truly hated, it was clowns.Thanks Stephen King - jerk.Grabbing a towel from an over turned baby cart, the loathsome Gravitor sauntered casually over to the ice cream stand.The attendant was nowhere to be seen... typical of these low work ethic kids these days.Back in the day, you would be expected to man that stand until ...well, never mind.Sometimes if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.In short order, the dark and dangerous Gravitor had whipped up a super sundae of epic proportions.It would be tastiness sung of by bards for generations to come...

STOP, VILLAIN!Startled, Gravitor looked up.Standing before him was the fabled Lightning, his arch nemesis.His now silver locks and square jaw as equally impressive as they ever had been.The two stared each other down for a moment, daring one another to move.Lightnings features softened and his eyes clouded over a bit.He spoke, his voice less certain, almost as if distant...

"My wife...have you seen her?She was here...I think.I don't know where she is.Have you seen my wife?Gravitor smiled genuinely, almost sweetly."I'm sorry sir, I haven't seen her anywhere.Ice cream?"Lightning nodded, greedily eying the overflowing bowl.Suddenly, concern spread across his face as he glanced nervously around before casting his gaze dejectedly at his feet."It's alright, sir, you already paid."With that, Gravitor watched his old arch nemesis shuffle off happily down the street.Being bad keeps getting harder to do every day.
