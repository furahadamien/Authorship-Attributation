I felt the soft grass under my feet before the fuzz in my head even had a chance to clear.Every fibre in my heavy body screamed at me that this time, we just may have made it.I took a deep breath, the clean air that filled my city lungs caught in my throat, along with the emotional lump that had formed.Willing my fingers to flex and my legs to bend, I slowly pushed myself up to a sitting position.My headache was only a dull throb now.It was hard to stand, leaving the clean smell of the dirt behind.My sharp green eyes surveyed the scene in front of me.I realized I was looking down and across a grassy landscape, littered with fluffy white sheep and dotted with a few dairy cows.The view was abruptly capped by a magnificent stone castle, towers touching the cerulean sky.I could have gotten lost in the wonder of it all.How my time machine had worked and I would never have to go back to the place that never wanted me!I could be king.I would be fair of course!All the new technology and ideals I would teach these medieval  people.As king, no one could tell me I was wrong, I was broken or I was twisted.I was shaken out of my reverie.Well, the earth shook me out of it.Alerting my senses my heart leaped in my chest.As they got closer the horse hooves thundered in my ears.At least two dozen men, in rawhide armour and tunics, a mule toting behind the beautiful horses carrying what looked like a large boar.So, a hunting party.Coming from behind me I felt the wind from the motion sweep past me and tickling my buzzcut head.The party halted a close distance away, but one man on the most dazzling white stallion I have ever seen kept on towards me.As he got closer I could see the sun glinting off his golden crown.His stereotypically blond cropped hair bounced with the strides of his beast and blue eyes sparkling with curiosity and apprehension the nearer he got to me.My heart beat a frantic stattico in my chest.I stood at 5'7" and 150 pounds soaking wet.When he swung out of the saddle I knew I couldn't beat him in a physical dual.His bulging muscles and at least 6'2" frame cast a shadow over my trembling form.Aniexty?Excitement?I had no idea.Even his apple iPhone ear buds beat my crappy dollar store brand ones.Wait, ear buds?"Hey bro, you alight!?"My head spun but out of sheer reflex I returned his offered fist bump.I couldn't stop the jolt of electricity that hit me the moment we touched.I saw a slight blush brush his sun touched cheeks.We both turned away slightly.I started, 
"How did you -"

Held up his leather gloves hand,  interrupting me."Same way you did."He remounted his horse, paused for a moment, then offered me a hand up.I took it.The leather warmed my hand and I let him help hoist me up on the back if the saddle.He glanced back at me, I was still shaking like a fool.His smile was bright and sincere, something in his eyes captured me.I just knew he felt it too.I felt safe, for a moment, on that hill with this king from the future, almost felt like home.
