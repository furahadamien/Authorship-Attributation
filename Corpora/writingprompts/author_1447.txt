Brad 1:1-4:20
Whence forth the L O R D went with his disciples, to heal the sick and wounded.Jesus and the twelve were walking down the streets of Capernaum.Peter spotted 2 men walking in the marketplace, trying to sell men their bro-fists.Peter asked, "L O R D, why doth these men sell bro-fists?"Jesus responded, "Peter, these men have no bro-fist.They are mentally insane.Whence forth they speak, they cannot.Whence forth they hear, they cannot.Whence forth they see, they cannot, for they are possessed by demonic spirits."One of the demoniacs walked up to the L O R D and spake, "Oh Jesus Christ, King of Kings, do not expel me from these men.If I must, cast me out to the 2  T H O U S A N D  P I G S." The L O R D  cast out the demons from the men.They talked with Jesus, and found their names to be Brad and Chad.Chad 4:20-4:25
