Prince_Edward_IV
Our race was unprepared for the coming of the Great Ones.It was not the first time, nor the second.They had blessed us before, bearing the gift of ascension to the great Celestial realms.The Moon was not her true form but the gift of Insight was as lost as the stories of their Greatness.And so the world, grown soft, and fat, and RIPE, was not prepared.I awoke to the Nightmare unaware of my part in it all.It was a text message that stirred me from sleep.A most mundane warning for a most extraordinary event.It was so long ago but the message was clear and I've never looked at the Moon since."DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON"

The Moonlight bore down upon the decrepit city, its light seeming to push down upon the rooftops, pressing the buildings deeper into the blood soaked streets, as though offended by mankind's folly.How dare they have the gall to raise themselves closer to the Surface.Not they.Us.He forgets again that he was still a man at his core.Twisted by the scourge and his soul forever tainted by the vile blood that gave him strength, but still a man.For now.With a wet, slurping, sound, he wrenched the head of his great axe free from the corpse of the beast, which was still clawing at its own vaguely human face.He had long since stopped wondering who they were before.It no longer concerned him.All he thought about were Eyes.To give him the Insight to see her as she truly is.Eyes on the inside.The Hunter paused a moment and caught his breath, still winded from the fight.Scanning the streets in front of him, he took note of the corpses that yet moved.Not all of them were his work, but most.And amid the buildings he could almost make out Their shapes now.Vast, inhuman, taking up infinite space and yet no space at all simultaneously.They were mere translucent shadows, a slight distortion in the air.They were every shape, every size, and yet not.But he could almost see Them.This was good.He was close to making Contact.Soon he would be able to See.And so the Hunter resumed his work, and strode confidently down the streets of Yarnham.Byrgenwerth awaited him.In the distance, The Newborn cried.(I've been playing a lot of Bloodborne.)
