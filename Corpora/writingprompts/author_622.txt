I got off the car groceries in hand.He would be coming back home soon after taking the kids all day for me to meet with friends.Today was my turn to cook dinner.The house was unusually quiet, such is the life of a parent, children are never silent and this was a rare moment.I sighed, there were clothes all over the place, guess whos turn it was to pick them later?It was when I placed the groceries on the coffee table that an old newspaper caught my attention: my own face, much younger was looking back at me.I chuckled.This was new, I had no memory of any of it, surely not that silly outfit, but as I read the details some things came back to me: a childhood where people shunned my type, a run where terrorized people fled in terror away from me, a bank robbery where I was finally beat down by a person I had taken hostage and caught, I had remembered things just... so differently: a humbling childhood where generous people helped me, a stroll down the street where people looked at me with compassion, a visit to the bank where people knew me kindly, even though my visits where sporadic.A lie.Deep inside none of the good things rang true.Now it seemed my husband had taken my children and left, as memories came flooding in I knew what I would have done: I would have chased him to the end of the world, I would have skinned himnot literally... maybeand recovered MY children.I felt my blood boil, electricity flashed from my neck down my spine and in my fingers, the mirror in front of me returning the stare of that woman from the newspaper for a hot second... and then a cool wave washed over me.He was right to leave, I was a danger to them all, as soon as someone checked an old newspaper, as an odd neighbor remembered.I sat on the couch, feeling alone for the first time since my new memories had been put in place, everything sunk in.The door knob rattled and turned a few minutes after.It was him, I bolted to the door, his arms caught me into an embrace.Our 2 children rushed past.You came back

Of course we did, not that we didnt want to stay at the lake house, but its not the same without you

But ...  he eyed the newspaper in my hands.Sam was looking for swimming clothes and I guess it was all stored together...I found it on the floor, I read page one, about what they did to all of us.Then page three and remembered all too.Why?

Come back?You are a great woman, a fantastic wife, the mother of my children... and not that person anymore
