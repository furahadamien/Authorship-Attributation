The childs name is Kite.She is not a pink little girl, nor a glitter little girl.Not a soccer little girl, nor a stars little girl.Kite is a rainbow little girl, and in her power she had fashioned you to be the same.Kite tips an empty tea pot over the bulb of your teacup.She makes shushing sounds as the tea pours.No living person can see the tea, except for Kite, and since no one besides Kite can see you either, you can see the tea.It is berry red and steaming.Thank you, you say.Your is voice deeper than it had been when you were alive.You love your new voice.It sounds the way you always thought your voice should.In life, your old voice surprised you, so thin compared to what you sounded like in your head, and so forced when you lowered it.Your reflection used to startle you in the same way, a stranger looking back.You died on the sidewalk stories below an apartment without mirrors.Kite sees you the way you always prayed yourself to be, and so you see yourself that way as well.Kite serves you painted cookies made of wood, leaving enough to give to her sock monkeys who have a hard time putting bananas on the table.You can eat the cookies because she can taste them.She can smell how well their cinnamon swirls crisped in her toy oven, so you can too.You thank her once more because you are grateful, and to hear your voice again.You are not allowed to follow Kite to school anymore.The two of you chat too often, laughing, echoing stories back and forth just to see how their rhythm would change.Mr. Kites Dad sat you both down and explained that it was okay for Kite to have an imaginary friend, but that it wasnt fair to disrupt the other students learning.Now you stay at home all day and chat politics with Kites porcelain horses.She can hear them so you can too.When Kite gets home from school, she does her rounds.She greets and listens, and changes the bandages on the piggy banks cracks before getting out her tea set.Four oclock teatime is sacred.The plushies and the hard-dolls know not to come knocking until you both are caught up on each others day.They know that you and Kite will fix everything, together, after four oclock teatime.This is the best job youve ever had.By drawing the pain out from your memories, Death has made you childlike.Wisdom without fear.You do not mind.You quite like it.Kite traces the border of her cookies frosting with her finger, preoccupied.You start the flow of the conversation.Quartz Heart is telling anyone that will listen that Professor Redcliff isnt who he says he is.She says she saw him without his eye-patch, and he looked exactly like Sweet Valentine did the day he disappeared, but Im not convinced. 

You sip your tea.Kite doesnt sip hers.Val would never suggest any of the cruel laws Redcliff has brought to the Council, but I have heard tell of something called a mind control brain cap somewhere in Underbed, but Im sure thats just a rumor.

We still havent found Val yet? Kite asks.She is concerned, but also a little distant.No, you say, solemnly, High Hopes is still searching from the sky, you point up to a plastic Pegasus tied to the paddle of the ceiling fan, circling, circling.Kite looks worried.Valentine is resourceful," you say, "I wouldnt lose hope yet.

Kite notes your intel.You are her confidant, her adviser, and her vizier.Together you keep the peace.Kite loves to keep the peace.There is more you could say about what happened today.A school day is a lifetime to a playroom.There was famine, fire, and a brief plague of flowers.You will tell her all about it soon.Did you have a nice trip to Sophie Sea today? you ask.Sophia had a rainbow pin on her backpack on her first day in Kite's class.Kite complimented it, and they became inseparable.You are happy to hold down the fort when Kite's on play-dates, especially since she brings home stories of mermaid treasure, mermaid magic, mermaid regicide.Sophie was a mermaid little girl.Shes going to be at Drews birthday party tonight, Kite says.You nod.Youre going to be attending as well.You and Kite picked out your suit and bow tie yesterday by nightlight.You are excited to met the mermaid queen from all Kite's stories.Except I dont think shes a girl. Kite says.You dont nod.You hold your sip of tea in your mouth.At least, thats what everyones saying. Kite swirls her cookie in her tea.It doesnt get soggy.What do you mean? you ask.I heard she used to be a boy at her old school, Kite says from behind her finger, I heard she changed her name, and that her hairs short because its only getting long for the first time, not because she cut it short.Levi said his cousin used to go to school with her and saw it happen.His cousin saw her used to be a boy.

You dont say anything.Kite starts to cry.I thought she and I were being friends, Kite drips, Best friends.But I cant be friends with her.Nobody likes her.They won't like me if Im friends with her.She used to be a boy.

Kite sobs.You scoop her up in your arms.She presses herself against the buttons of your shirt.You hold her, but your mind is elsewhere, sinking, falling.A tick of time trips by.Are you okay? you ask, when you feel there again.Are you okay? Kite asks, just as concerned.Her spymaster does not usually go silent when she brings him evidence of deceit, and he absolutely never leaves her to cry alone.You arent sure if youre okay.Who wont like you anymore if you are friends with Sophie? you start, slowly.Kite scrubs her cheeks, Levi says no one should be her friend.Everyone agreed.Drew is the only other kid who talks to me besides for Sophie, and he says hell stop if I keep hanging out with her.

You want let Kite know youre on her side.You'll always be on Kite's side.But when you go to speak, ready to remind Kite that she doesnt need Sophie if she doesnt want Sophie, ready to remind Kite she has you, you remember how your voice will sound as you say it.It will sound the way you always prayed your voice would sound in life.Deep and warm as a dive in July.Kite sees you the way you always knew yourself to be, and so that is how you are now.And why shouldn't people be Sophie's friend? you ask.How are you allowed to change who you are?Thats not allowed.

Who says? you ask.Kite thinks.Everyone is acting like she broke a rule.Like shes a liar.

Do you think Sophies lying?Do you think Sophies not really a girl.

Of course, Sophies a girl.But she used to be a boy, Kite presses.What if she was never a boy? you ask, gently.And even if she was, you say shes a girl now.Is she hurting anyone by being a girl?

Kite sniffs, no.

Saying that Sophies not hurting anyone that makes Kite cry again.You are so proud to be Kites imaginary friend.Kite is kind.Kite is a leader.You wouldnt trade Kite for a second chance at life.But, right now, you wonder why you werent given to Sophie instead.You cradle Kite.You ask her what you wish someone had asked on your behalf long before Kite was born, Dont we owe it to a friend to stand with them when the world is against them?

By taking away the pain from your memories, Death has made you childlike, but Death did not make you naive.Childhood is when you dont know the world is watching.Adolescence is when you try to change yourself to protect yourself against the world.Adulthood is when you start trying to change the world to protect the child you once were.The title of golden is give to the wrong rule, you whisper to Kite, The golden rule should be Accept others how youd want to be accepted, because if you do that, treating them how youd want to be treated will follow.

Kite looks up at you, understanding what she must do.Mr. Kites Dad calls up the stairs that it is time to go to Drews party at the park.Kite takes your hand.She sees you as being in your party outfit, so you see it too.At the corner of a picnic table, alone, you see Kites best friend.Sophie is a mermaid little girl.She wears a sea green headband over her growing hair, and a purple shell around her neck.There are dogs and first fireflies.The grill smokes, the hotdogs snap, the cake melts under a shade-tree.The kids are cluster off and on like clouds, some alone, some together, groups flowing between each other, but never staying as one.Kite runs up to Sophie and hugs her for a long time.Together, they are two.Sophie follows as Kite does rounds through the party.Kite invites a boy who was sitting alone to walk beside them.The three become five as they wave a pair of little sisters into their group.Kite brings over Drew to make six.Drew brings over Neveah and Jonah, and, before long, they have all made a game out of whose love can be given with the least conditions.Levi doesnt join, but he does take notice that Sophie is part of a larger group than he is.Someday Kite will outgrow you.It will happen around the time when the price of being herself grows higher than the price of not being herself.She will sacrifice her happiness to her happiness in hopes of being happy.You pray that the price of being kind to others never charges more than she can pay.You pray for her that someday the price of not being herself will grow higher than the price of being herself, just not in the way it did for you.Let Kite shatter outward, not inward.You died on the sidewalk stories below an apartment without mirrors and one open window.Let Kite fly.The children run circles.The dogs do too.The moths circle the streetlamps halo, and because Kite is joyful, and brave, and hopeful, and loving, you are too.
