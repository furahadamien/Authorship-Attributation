It had been 20 years since he could buy cigarettes at the store, and he and his smoking buddies had to form a group just to make cigarettes.It was hard enough to find the tobacco these days, but all the other ingredients were almost impossible.He had a greenhouse and workshop where he diligently rolled the one pack per day that he still smoked, and he had considered quitting after half of his group had died of lung cancer, but he figured he had lasted this long and the release it gave him was still the best part of most days.It seemed ridiculous that someone was still spending money on these ads he had seen all his life."It would be much easier for them to just give me the money they spent on the ad and entice me to quit," he thought.He saw them daily now, no matter the magazine he read or the road he drove.Billboards must be cheap in a small town.The latest one cut him deep.It simply said, "We found out it's a boy, dad, and we want you to watch him grow up.Stop smoking, please."
