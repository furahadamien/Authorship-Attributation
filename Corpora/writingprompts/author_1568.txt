I am so very tired.I wouldn't suppose you could understand.I was not at work.I was a child, impatient at the dinner table, quick to shoot and slow to question.Your sicknesses - the poisons that tear away your soul so slowly and painfully that you can cry and scream and finally find yourself too weak to fight back - I am responsible.You are a species of determination, creation, progress.I understand your want to carry on.I've become fond of my prey - like a cat, tired of chasing mice, content to lay beside rats in her final days.I feel sorrow for you now.I ask you - are you ready to die?- and pray you do not understand.There is someone else, somewhere out there, poisoning me.Listening to my cries and screams, waiting, waiting until I am too weak to fight back.I understand what I did to you.I ask you to forgive me now: I did it to survive.
