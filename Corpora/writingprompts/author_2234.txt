The craft was discovered in the outer reaches of solar system.Satellites tracked the strange object as it entered the vicinity of the planet.It was obviously constructed, not naturally formed.If the appearance of deliberate design wasn't enough of an indication, then the radio signals it kept sending out proved it so.It was the first indication of extraterrestrial life ever received, the clearest and most undeniable proof that they were not alone in the universe.After that was what could only be described as a frenzy.Scientists gathered together to study the strange technology, to unlock the secrets that it held.Governments fought over control of the craft.And the people went into hysterics.Centuries of culture, spirituality, belief, was put into question the moment it arrived.Religious leaders called it a sign from the gods.Artisans were inspired, imagining what these extraterrestrial beings looked like.It was a cultural upheaval unlike any other.But with its existence came the questions.Where did it come from?Who built it?Why was it made?The greatest minds in the world came together to answer them.Through their combined efforts, they were able to piece together the inner workings of, what was discovered as, ancient and alien technology.It was through a strange yellow metallic disk that contained grooves and symbs on both sides.At first, it was believed to be nothing more than a vestigial mechanical piece.But they soon proved this wrong when the engineers finally understood their purpose.The disk was a message of sorts.The local technology did not mesh well with the alien engineering, but they nonetheless sparsed its contents.Images of strange objects and symbols.Some were recognizable, like the picture of a star and it's orbiting planets.Others less so, like the group of symbols that were discovered to be a strange form of mathematics that resembled and differed from their own.Images of living creatures in unfamiliar terrains, some even hostile to the species.There were also sounds embedded in the metal.A strange composition of high and low frequency waves that were both above and below the hearing ranges of the species.It was there first image of the strange  and distant world called "Earth".The revelation of its knowledge is considered by many as the greatest discovery in history, seconded only by the discovery of extraterrestrial life itself.But then, another discovery was made.It was was, once again, a discovery that  forever changed the course of history.An image made of lines, once considered as the alien's form of art, was translated to be a rudimentary map to its origin.It was primitive, and used rapidly rotating neutron stars as points that would indicate it's location.The system was incredibly flawed.They had to figure out which of the many stars was used, if they still existed, and calculated when all these stars were pulsing their radiation in an area that created the same set of coordinates on the plate.After that, they had to calculate where the planet would be now, given the movement of the stars in the galaxy and in the universe.It was daunting, and they almost gave up.But they managed to pull through.Now, cycles after its discovery, they were finally headed to the origin.The project is singlehandedly the most expensive endeavour in their history, and could possibly be the most important.Probes were initially made and released to gather intelligence on the area, simultaneously tested for the capacity of using a space-time bridge as a form of travel.When they received confirmation that a planet of similar description filled with alien life was discovered, they fast tracked the creation of the most advance space ship ever built, large enough to hold a sizeable crew, a vessel capable of initiating a bridge in space-time for instant arrival.It would bring them to the planet in no time.So, in an array of lights and collapsing physics, their ship jumped through the bridge, into a new world of possibility.Theories of what they would find were abound, the probe design to make rudimentary confirmations of the planet and it's contents.They know that it was mostly liquid on the surface.Its land masses were rife with strange vegetation and animal life, very different from their own.All over the planet, there were structures that did not appear natural.They could only be described as artificially created buildings.They viewed this as the proof that they had found the planet.They were positive that they would finally meet another form of intelligent life.But as they reappeared within the area of the planet, the bridge collapsing behind them in a cascade of rainbows, they were shocked with what they discovered.Instead of a planet of blue and filled with intelligent life, all they found was darkness.No planet, no sun, not even the stars themselves were there.Sensors indicated the presence of absolutely nothing.It was almost like they stepped into a void.A section of the universe that was completely blank and empty.Not even background radiation.Only an endless void that filled them with dread.They tried to investigate, sending out more probes and scanners in the area.They all came back negative.No forms of matter were detected for light years in the area.All the sensors told them that there was nothing there.All except one.A solitary probe returned with a message received  from an unidentifiable origin.They tried to locate the source, but it was futile.Wherever it came from, it was lost in the sea of void that surrounded them.They picked apart the signal received and translated it into their native tongue and hearing frequency.The computers did their best to integrate as much of the original content as it could.They succeeded.With trepidation, they listened to what it had to say.And immediately regretted it.It was chorus of screams, of cries of pain and suffering unlike ever heard before.Agony rendered to sound.Pure pain and misery.Mixed within the wails was a message, repeated over and over to infinity.*We made a mistake.*
