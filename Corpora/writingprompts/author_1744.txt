I live every day in anxiety.My friends that I have made here one by one either sent to Jannah or jahanam.We obsess over our sins, or rather every action we also perceive will send us buring through eternity.My self esteem is in shambles.I was an athiest.I left islam.I am an apostate.My parents were right.All their pleads with me telling me to pray to Allah and I shut my ears from pride.I want to scream from anger.I am shaking in regret.I haven't been able to eat anything, endless vomiting.I haven't showered all I do is try and sleep to forge but each day I know I am closer to my fate.There is no way that I am not buring in hell.Andre, the boy I met here what tipped him over the edge was his habit of backbiting.All of a sudden it goes black.I ask myself if I am in a dream.I touch my eyes and feel wetness, they are open,  I breathe faster.Is this it?Marla a voice says and four people are standing 20 feet from me.My ex, my friend, my patient, and my best friend.What is this I ask.Ian's testimony, you never loved me you laughed when I spilled my heart out to you in our messages, showing her, rolling your eyes, assuring me you cared, I gave you all the love I could, you destroyed me, I cut and burned.did you care?was it anothe joke to you, when you hid me from everyone and I didn't not know, hell I didn't find out till now.
