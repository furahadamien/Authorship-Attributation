I peered down curiously and raised a perfectly groomed brow.'And who might you be, dwarf dressed in bee's clothing?'I postulated.'I am no double agent, Majesty.I have come to save you from this festering human scum you were placed in to learn destruction.'I pondered over this for a while, then looked down at my latest imaginary manifestation."I suppose you're going to argue your reality too, just like the rest," I mused."The rest, your majesty?I was the first of your court that has managed to approach you unswatted.We have held the funeral services of all of our beloved smooshed, and the names of each of your loyal soldiers has been engraved with the stings of the sacrificial tombstone bees.""Oh I don't mean bees, I mean my other hallucinations," I muttered."My Queen.You are troubled, and that is no surprise, for you have been mutated to this human beeing by our supBeerior biophysicists.Such confusion was not anticipated as you are our first changeling.The war of the birds and bees has been raging for many a century, with your legendary warrior Queen grandmothers waging attack after attack at the birds who hunted our young.The bears are their allies, so you can imagine our difficulty in maintaining a sustainable hive and sending off our strongest workers to the front line.We are tired of warfare.Complete decimation was required, but bees are plagued by a superior moral code.Hence we sent you to this realm to be conditioned to destruction.""Well.Weren't you supposed to have taken me to your crumbling hive palace first, pretended everything was fine and dandy, and then slowly trickled information in so that I'd be more receptive to it, all the while throwing the best of my society at me so that I'd feel a fierce protective instinct towards them?""Ah.It seems our dreams are realised.You have learnt their art, and learnt it well.Come.Place your finger on my sting.The memories of your true form will come back."I sighed.It was futile to fight with my many honey induced delusions.I was drawn to it like...Well, like a bee to honey.Whenever I ate it, undetected by my parents, I began to have the craziest experiences.Honey was contraband in my home, so naturally, I sought it out.One drop, and I was lost in the ambrosia so dear to me.What was odd about this encounter, though, was the fact that I hadn't had a single spoon of honey in two weeks.My stash was depleted.My vision clear.But perhaps someone had slipped it into my tea without my knowledge.Comforted by this conclusion, I lowered the pad of my index finger to the sting of my supposed killer.
