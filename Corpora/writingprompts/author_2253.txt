"Among these innumerable odds, is there a word greater than chance?"The young navigation ensign jotted on the margins of their intele-pad.It was a personal note, they didnt even look away from the main screen while scribbling it down.Their science Voyager had just entered a long dead solar system.The sun seemed to have been consumed by a Dyson sphere long before its time; and yet the planets maintained an unnatural orbit in the dark.Their gravitational fields perverted, locked together for countless billions of cycles.The very galaxy they occupied was merely remnants of several colliding.Yet through some perserversence the signs yet remained as though begging to be remembered.To understand why this scientific vessel was here, you would have to go back several million cycles.An unlikely discovery deep in the dark between galaxies.A craft was discovered.At first dismissed for being a large geometrically unique asteroid, curiously rectangular.But it was so much more.Over the course of a few hundred thousands cycles its origin would be pinpointed amongst a chaotic celestial plane.The purpose of this vessel isnt really known.Perhaps they were trying to escape.Perhaps they were just alone and wanted to tempt the great expanse.They were alone.Amongst an indifferent and silent universe."In the spirit of unity, we crossed that sea."The captain began to say.Quoting a great philosopher of another long extinct species.As the captain continued to ordain  the navigation ensign lost focused.Their mind drifted slightly; sesay from duty and into imagination.Filled with thoughts of this first sentient world.Their counsel beginning to buzz with data fed from vsrious probes.Images of structures.Of land scapes.Of the first place to remember their past.
