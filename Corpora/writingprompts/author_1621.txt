I gasped awake, my face drenched with sweat.That had been the most vivid nightmare I had ever had.The most horrifying part was that it still felt real, more real than anything.Anna sat up next to me and massaged my back."What's wrong, honey?"I waved my hand at her."It's nothing.Just a bad dream."I didn't even convince myself saying that, but it seemed to satisfy her."If you're sure."She lay back down and felt asleep quickly.I tried to follow suit, but the realm of dreams evaded me.I got out of bed and put on some clothing.A walk would help me clear my head.I grabbed my coat and walked out the door.I took a deep breath and felt the cold air fill my lungs.This had to be real.It had to be.Still, I couldn't remember ever taking them off.My mind flew back 20 years to my 10th birthday...

"Oh, boy, a VR headset!"I cried out.I had asked for one, but I had never expected my parents to actually get one.I ran and hugged them close."Thank you!"I looked at the box and squinted."Simulated reality?"I read in the side of the box.I shrugged and ripped open the box.I took out the precious headset and slipped it on my head.In a few seconds, I had already started getting bored.It was just a plain room, with a door on one side.I had arms and legs and a body, but when I reached my hands next to my head, they disappeared.I had opened the door and walked through, and it started loading.I waited a few seconds, and I heard mom ask me how I was liking their gift."It's great!"I lied.I saw them in front of me and I sighed.I hadn't even really enjoyed it that much.I continued on to my other gifts, and my birthday continued as normal.I shook my head.Had I taken it off?Everything told me I had, but my memory said otherwise.I curled up on the street and grabbed my head, and I saw my hands disappear in my peripheral vision.
