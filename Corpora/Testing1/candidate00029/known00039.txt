

<NAME/>:

I have not received anything from anyone in London or anywhere else regarding positions, etc.

I did speak with a Weil bankruptcy lawyer and there were many issues especially with respect to ENA positions (and I don't know where the high value credit positions are booked).  They believe that we may have structuring issues working through London and not directly with a purchaser.

Can you send the information over here?
