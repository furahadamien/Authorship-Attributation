My impression is that the <NAME/> commodities traders will be signing off on this, possibly with minor comments, as early as this morning.  If you guys want to make comments (maybe have metals excluded if our traders disagree with the approach), please let <NAME/> Shackleton or <NAME/> Gray know as soon as possible.
