      I thought you had talked to <NAME/> about covering for <NAME/> on Friday afternoons.  She needs to know that "covering" means she needs to stay beyond 3:40 (at least until close of business), which is when she rushed out on Friday.  I had phones shifted over to <NAME/> after I got a call from <NAME/> looking to find <NAME/> or me.  If you haven't talked with her, I will I'd you'd prefer.
