Last update that I know about for CDWR costs.  If <NAME/> or <NAME/> know of later $ figures, please advise <NAME/>.  Also, my understanding was that the CPUC simply disallowed the CDWR from having straight passthru without review.  They may get to charge 100% of these dollars, but needs CPUC approval.
