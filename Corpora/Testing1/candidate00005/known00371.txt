

Thanks.

It makes sense for <NAME/> and <NAME/> to get together (I am available to talk tomorrow and have asked <NAME/> to set something up).  

Also, we need to work together to make sure that EES' reports, taxes, and other requirements are filed in a timely fashion (with the right internal groups).

On the IL Bond issue, there must be a disconnect between us and the ICC.  The ICC believes that our Bond isn't current.  Maybe we can figure this out together tomorrow?

Call if anyone has any questions.  

<NAME/>
