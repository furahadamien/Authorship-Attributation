

As some of you may be aware, <NAME/>'s consulting arrangement with <NAME/> ends later this fall.  In an effort to make the transition as easy as possible, I would recommend that the following people work with <NAME/> to transition on critical committees and tasks (nothing is hardwired, so if we need to change people, let me know).

<NAME/> will attend the upcoming WSCC EPITF meeting (not sure of date, but think in the next two weeks).  My recommendation is that <NAME/> <NAME/> attend with <NAME/> and become the lead.  We may not get a voting seat after <NAME/> leaves, but we should try and cover.

<NAME/> Alvarez should attend the WSCC Board Meeting on Aug 27 with <NAME/> to pick up these responsibilities.

<NAME/> Yeung should pick up coverage for the FlowBased discussions.  <NAME/> will not attend the next meeting in Chicago that takes place on Aug 30.  

<NAME/> Rodriguez should pick up the Security Coordinator Subcommitte discussions that take place Sept 25 - 27.  <NAME/> will not attend.

I think that <NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/> and I should attend the NERC Stakeholders Mtg on Oct 15 - 16.

Finally, <NAME/> Perrino should go with <NAME/> to the next WSCC OCTPG meeting.

Let me know if this transition plan works.

<NAME/>
