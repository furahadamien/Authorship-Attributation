Can you prepare a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a meeting. The concept is that a deal flows into a website?? that is basically a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped. If it met deal criteria and portfolio requirements, it would flow directly to an outside shop that would fund, bill, track etc. <NAME/> could possibly keep a small interest in economics and of course a skim. 

Lets review presentation, then discuss with <NAME/>/<NAME/> and <NAME/> D.  and proceed to banks. <NAME/> is clearing idea with <NAME/>. We are shooting for a Friday (23) meeting.

Thanks, <NAME/>
