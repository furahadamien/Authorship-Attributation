It is with great sorrow that I must announce the passing of <NAME/> Knight, manager in the Market Risk Group. <NAME/> succumbed to cancer on Feb. 22, 2001 and will have funeral services in Florida. There may be a memorial service here in <NAME/> arranged through his church but details have not been announced. Please contact <NAME/> Valdez for details.

<NAME/> was with RAC and <NAME/> only briefly before being diagnosed, but made a real impact especially on those that worked closely with him. <NAME/> had  a warm and personable style, which along with his technical capability, made him a real asset to the group. He will be missed.
