

The Board meeting has concluded and I can now focus on the task force. The following people in RAC have been assigned to this effort as follows:

Legacy Opportunity

<NAME/> <NAME/>
<NAME/> Seibel
<NAME/> Copeland
<NAME/> Tribolet
<NAME/> Hachen
Minal <NAME/>
<NAME/> Rollins
<NAME/> <NAME/>
<NAME/> Soo
<NAME/> Brackett
<NAME/> Vasan

On Going Opportunities

<NAME/> Fury
<NAME/> <NAME/>
Dana Smith
<NAME/> Greer
<NAME/> O'leary
<NAME/> Hachen
<NAME/> Gorte
<NAME/> Schmidt
Vladi Gorny
<NAME/> Port
<NAME/> Soo

This is a huge commitment of staff from RAC and will strain us no end, but it is necessary. If you want RAC to lead this effort I will appoint <NAME/> Tribolet to manage the task. If you want someone else to manage the  effort we will assist as we can. Regardless of who leads this effort we need following:

Commitment of EES back office staff people 
Commitment of IT resources
Commitment of Skilling to fund the overage to the RAC budget, which I am under huge pressure to reduce, not increase.

Let me know how to launch this program.
