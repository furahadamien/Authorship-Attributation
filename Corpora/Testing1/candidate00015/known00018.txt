

<NAME/>,

I understand that you are the contact person for MHI concerning the ash spec for the 501F turbine being used on the Ft. <NAME/> project.  I have been working with <NAME/> Tezyk to finalize all issues concerning this fuel oil spec. Please let me know as soon as possible what the MHI response is regarding the inability to get 0% ash fuel oil.   We are trying to get closure on this issue so we can order the fuel oil to replace that which we caused FPUA to burn to begin construction on the site.

Thanks!

<NAME/> <NAME/>
