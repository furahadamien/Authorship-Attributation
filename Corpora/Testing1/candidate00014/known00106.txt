i think it will be easy to get back into the swing of thigns -- sitting on my ass for two months has been a nice distraction, but its gotten really boring.  trading is exciting and i'm looking forward to it - should be like jumping into a cold pool.  i'm actually doing real work lately which is great.  i still have no idea what you do at work.  anything interesting?  

yes, the new babe lair should be sweet - we'll need auntie's recommendations.  just make sure you shit in jai's toilet.  it might be harder for you than me, but peeing on the toilet seat is always a good way to get your message across - as a woman, i think it would send an especially clear signal.  are you stopping by this weekend?  i'm having a couch delivered on sat between 10 and 2, so i think we'll be around then for sure.  

5 times a day is no problem, but 5 times a day seven days a week might be a push, but with the right stimulation anything is possible.  is chrissy a 5x7 kind of chick?  wow.  and, of course, retention is always an interesting experiment.  

we'll have to go to big wally's - especially if its not my style.  i haven't spent much time in kensington, but it seems like there are some good spots there.
