In his  urlLink February 14, 2003 post  Ray Matthews writes "In this site, we'll monitor creative uses of RSS to provide information to the public above government information and services".  Ray has done this since February 2003 and a quick look around his site convinced me. Most of the posts are about US sites and feeds but there are links to news about foreign government RSS feeds like  urlLink this one  and  urlLink this one .
Simple and well-considered&nbsp;"cut to the chase" arguments why  urlLink RSS is a nice thing  for news-junkies. And why companies should publish RSS feeds.
This is old news. Actually I first saw it mentionend on  urlLink Blackbeltjones . There's since been some discussion as you can see in the comments to the  urlLink original entry . Reading through the comments it seems there is a similar service for  urlLink Google News . I haven't tested yet but thought I would put up here and let people comment on it. Check it out at  urlLink Gnews2RSS at VoidStar.com .
In connection with the&nbsp;comments of&nbsp;Angelo, here´s what the web consultant,  urlLink Jason Cook , has to say about Atom and RSS.  &nbsp;
You either love him or hate him. But the food he creates&nbsp;is - in my opinion -&nbsp;exellent and reasonably easy to cook in your own kitchen.  urlLink The Naked Chef  is also hipped on the net, now he feeds us with RSS.
Up till now both Utzon and I have been focused on RSS and the multitude of newsfeeds out there. We have steadily been growing more and more happy because it makes our jobs a lot easier. As everyone else we are able to cover more ground information wise in a shorter time. Then Atom is introduced. What is it ? Will it make our professional lives even more easy ? I have no idea. I'm not even sure where I first saw Atom mentioned. I think it was  urlLink this entry  on  urlLink Dive Into Mark . That was a year ago and I still haven't found out what the difference between RSS and Atom is and why supposedly Atom is better or if it is better. Another  urlLink entry  (from last year) at Dive Into Mark maybe help. When I have had time to go through the  urlLink AtomEnabled  website and hopefully become more informed I will let you know.
A few months ago I discovered  urlLink del.icio.us  {via  urlLink Veen , I think} but did not really take action on it. I registered and put it aside for later. Now, having started this blog with Utzon, I think it is time to use this exellent service. The  urlLink del.icio.us  service publishes a RSS feed of the category pages. Check out the  urlLink RSS category page .  BTW, Jeff Veen has a good  urlLink tutorial  on how to publish  urlLink del.icio.us  links on your own site.
It may be a bit dated but none the less still a valuable resource for some.   urlLink RSS - A Primer for Publishers and Content Providers . {via  urlLink Weblogs Compenium - RSS Resources }
As in other  urlLink areas  the O'Reilly devcenter pages contain a wealth of useful information. Check out the  urlLink O'Reilly Network: RSS DevCenter .
The New York Times offers a number of  urlLink RSS feeds .
Without really knowing what this might evolve in to I've decided to just starting posting links to RSS articles and resources. We are not sure  urlLink Blogger  is the right way to go but eventually we will find out the best course of action to collect interesting stuff about RSS and other stuff we use in our jobs. Well, here are the first links. Enjoy    urlLink Alexa's Hot Search Terms, Movers & Shakers, or Top Sites with RSS   urlLink RSS Ads - let's get it on!!!  both via  urlLink Adam Kalsey's blog .
Found  urlLink RSSCalendar  yesterday while browsing around. Looks nice and I certainly like the idea. Works great for a large group of people.

Arnakke easter 2003.
urlLink I AM SO COOL
We visit my parents quite often, even more now since we have bought a house in Hvalsoe, a small village near by. Noah enjoys the company of Grandpa and Grandma - and they adore him endlessly.
Noah just loves to swim, here the scene is Frederiksberg Svoemmehal. This picture was taken a month after we came home with Noah from South Africa.

Our very good friends Hanna and Martin with their charming son, William, who is also adopted from South Africa.             urlLink
Vacation at Groennestrand in june 2004           urlLink
after running around the beach all day. Noah with his best friend William.
Picture taken at Groennestrand, Western Jutland, on a vacation in june 2004.
on new years day 2003 was a fantastic experience for Noah.          urlLink What is the white stuff on the ground?
Main theme will be our son and his adoption from South Africa. And maybe adoption from South Africa in generel. Noahs mother Henriette and me - his proud father Peter - will try to link to all important sites trying to help other couples with adoption desires, problems and hopes. But first of all we will tell the story of our son, Noah Mpho, in text and in pictures.
