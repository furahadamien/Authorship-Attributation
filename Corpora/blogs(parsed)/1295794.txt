From "Conversations with Charlie...," 08/02/04:   I took the five seconds of silence to think of what it must have been like, back then. I took those seconds to realize, once again, that my generation has nothing to hold onto. In the twilight of my life, I will have nothing glorious to look back on.    Revision:   Five seconds of silence ticked, to and fro, between Charlie and me. So Charlie had had that first ballgame, the way first ballgames are supposed to be. Did I have one? I couldn't remember. Ticket prices have skyrocketed since Charlie's time, if anything I would remember the hell just getting those damned tickets. I wondered if any of my boyfriends remembered their first ballgame.  Did they?  Or were they too busy making money for the weekend bash in Long Island? Or for a new video game set and iPod? But didn't Charlie just say that it's the kind of thing a boy never forgets --  his first ballgame ?  But I knew that it wasn't  really  about a first baseball game. It was about something else, something  intangible  that, in the twilight of our lives, still glimmered just beyond the darkening horizon. Was it the immutable, eternal moment of a simple joy? Did anyone in my generation even know what a  simple joy  was, the way Charlie knew and loved  his  simple joys? As those five seconds tailed-off, as Tivo flashed through my mind like a sinful thought, I began to understand. I realized how it was that my generation was, indeed, a generation without glory.
There was once a King and, like any other king, had everything he desired. All this was not enough for him, though. Night after night, the King tossed and turned in his royal bed, tormenting himself over this dilemma.  One day, he decided to visit his Wise Man.  "Wise One," started the King, anxiously, "please help me."  "What can I do for you, Majesty?" The Wise one peered curiously at the King with his beady black eyes, under a pair of grey knitted brows.  "I need something that I cannot find myself. Something that will make me happy when I am sad, and sad when I am happy."  "Maybe I  can  help you," murmured the Wise Man, as he began to sort through his baskets of  stuff .  "Here," beamed the Wise Man, "wear this on your finger."  The Wise Man handed to the King a simple, golden ring. Confused, the King put this ring on his finger.  As he wandered away, however, the King noticed a small inscription around the ring.   This, too, will change.

The sun was shining brightly on the front of CafÃ© Zannyâ€™s. It was a fair place to sit on such a fair day, I thought, as I took a final drag from my cigarette. I crushed the spent Lucky under my flip-flop. Charlie sat on the wooden bench adjacent to me.  â€œYou know,â€ Charlie puffed on his cigarette, â€œI donâ€™t get into other peopleâ€™s business. I keep to myself. Iâ€™ve been living in this neighborhood for a year and a half now. Sometimes, I drop by that 1020 bar to say hi to Timmy. You know Timmy?â€  I nodded.  â€œBoy, heâ€™s a  real  Boston fan. I keep telling myself, I just  gotta  go to Fenway before they tear that ballpark down. Fenway is an old ballpark, you know. Classic. I gotta go there soon, I guess. And I have to go there with a real Boston fan, like Timmy. Boy, that would be a great time, before I go.â€  I smiled. Yes, I knew Tim Monaghan. There isnâ€™t a Red Sox fan in all of New England like Timmy.  â€œYou know, this was before you were born, in the seventies. I used to go to Gallagherâ€™s downtown, every Monday night. We called it the Monday Night club and we had a private dining room upstairs, in the back.â€ He took another drag from his cigarette. â€œOne night, my friend says to me, â€˜Over there, do you know who that is?â€™ And I said, â€˜Why, thatâ€™s Ted Williams!â€™ You wouldnâ€™t believe it.  Ted Williams  was at our Monday Night club at Gallaghers!â€  I took a sip of my coffee. Teddy Ballgame.  Man .  â€œYou know, the one thing Williams loves best after baseball is fishing. Boy, youâ€™ve never seen a fishing aficionado like Ted! So, I go and tell him on the side, â€˜Mr. Williams, now I know that you love fishing. I know the perfect place in the West Indies for you to go fly-fishing. Theyâ€™ve got huge hotels, hundreds of rooms and dining rooms and ballrooms, you canâ€™t go through it all in a whole month! But that ainâ€™t nothing compared to the  fly-fishing  you get down there. Why, this is where the professionals go to fish! I think you might like it, Mr. Williams.â€™â€  Charlie was now crouched over my knee. His grey, grizzly eyebrows were arched and his sunken eyes peering intensely up at me. Perhaps I was supposed to be in disbelief.  â€œSo Mr. Williams steps out of the crowd and says to me, â€˜Well, that sounds just like my kind of place.â€™ Wouldnâ€™t you know it, man, Mr. Williams talked to me for a whole half-hour about fly-fishing!â€  Charlie leaned back onto the bench as in full-bellied satisfaction, and flicked his cigarette to the pavement. His eyes vanished into a squint, the sun was setting squarely on his leathery face. He lit another Pall Mall.  â€œThose were  good  times, oh boy! I look back and I say to myself, I wouldnâ€™t change a thing about it.â€  His face, crinkled in a grin as wide as Broadway, was smothered in his exhaled smoke.  â€œYou know,â€ he continued, â€œWhen I was in grammar school -- this was back in â€™46, well before your time -- that was when my father took me out to my  very   first ballgame . I remember it clearly, because a young boy just doesnâ€™t forget these kinda things. It was my first ballgame, in fact it was Opening Day at Yankee Stadium. They were playing the Dodgers. Boy, was it something. And my father takes me out of school and says to the headmaster, â€˜Sir, you know, my son here is going to learn more about life at Yankee Stadium today, than he will ever learn in your damned school.â€™â€  Charlieâ€™s eyes were now far away from Zanny's. He had returned to another space, another time.  â€œGee, you see, my father  takes me out of school  to take me to my first ballgame. There's nothing like it, I tell you.  â€œYou see, baseball was a  real  game back then, not like it is now. We used to have only eight teams, so every Sunday the city would explode. We had the Yankees, the Dodgers and the Giants across the River. Boy, oh boy, people would go just wild! And then if you went to the stadium to see the game, first youâ€™d get the minor league game, then the major league game. Those were  good  times, I tell you.â€  I took the five seconds of silence to think of what it must have been like, back then. I took those seconds to realize, once again, that my generation has nothing to hold onto. In the twilight of my life, I will have nothing glorious to look back on.  â€œYeah, Charlie,â€ I said. â€œI was born in the wrong generation. Big money, clubbing at hotspots and a house in the Hamptons donâ€™t do a thing for me. I belong somewhere else, Charlie.â€ I blew my bangs from my face. â€œI missed it all, the life youâ€™ve lived and Iâ€™ve only imagined. Itâ€™s up to folks like you to tell me how it was.â€  â€œI know what youâ€™re saying. I may be an old geezer, you see,â€ he waggled his finger at me, â€œbut I know whatâ€™s going on.â€  Charlie paused. His eyes fell, darkened.  â€œYeah, the times  have  changed, I guess.â€
