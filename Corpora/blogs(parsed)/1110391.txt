My sister sat in the living room in front of the television. As always she was looking through her  Tiger Beat  and other pre-teen magazines.  â€œWhatâ€™s on TV?â€  â€œA 'Charlie Brown Christmas.' Why?â€  â€œBecause Piggy should watch it too!â€ I started to run off into my bedroom to get Piggy.  My sister called out after me, â€œAre you retarded or something?â€  I stopped and turned around, â€œNo.â€  â€œI think you are. Youâ€™re totally an MR-MR running around with a can for a pet.â€  â€œI AM NOT A MENTALLY RETARDED MONKEY RAPER!â€ I screamed. â€œAnd Piggyâ€™s real, and mom said I can get another one tomorrow at the store!â€ I ran down the hall and picked Piggy up out of her cage. I walked back into the living room and took my perch on the couch above my sister who was now lying on the floor. I could tell Piggy enjoyed â€œA Charlie Brown Christmasâ€ because she sat so contently while it was on.  In bed that evening I tossed and turned with anticipation about getting the new friend.
The red of the walls bled through the panes of translucent plastic sheeting she applied to the sides of the room. A placement tray, sterilized with hibiclens soap was equipped with a scalpel, drill and bits, gauze and potions of sodium chloride, Lidocaine and Epinephrine. He read the box of latex gloves, size medium, ready to be donned by his girlfriend. He remembered his motherâ€™s hands that used to freely pat his head.   He had already prepped a portion of his head, three inches by three inches shaved, with a orange disposable razor. His scalp was smooth and clean. â€œChoke me,â€ he said â€œto map my veins with this blue pen.â€ There was no hesitation as a hand wrapped around the front of his throat and a diagram was drawn.  A hypodermic needle, filled with a 1cc mixture of Lidocaine and Epinephrine punctured the canvas of skin. The area went numb, the room quiet. She took a scalpel and made a half moon incision larger than a nickel but smaller than a quarter. â€œI want to have a sense of Godâ€ he muttered.  Forceps and fore fingers pulled at the skin. It was adhered stronger than she thought. The scalpel sawed the flesh from the skull. Sodium chloride irrigation helped wash away the blood. â€œAre you sure you want to go through with this?â€ she pressed.  â€œYes.â€  The Dremmel with ball and flame-shaped burrs were used at drill speed 4. The buzzing reverberated through his jaws, down his spine, to the tip of his toes. She drilled and irrigated. The bone turned to dust. Twenty minutes, thirty minutes, marrow. Drill speed 2. One hourâ€” meninges. It opened.  His brain pulsated. A sign of success. â€œLetâ€™s widen the hole.â€ The drill went on, slowly. Her hands moved with trepidation. â€œI canâ€™t widen it anymore.â€  She unfolded the skin. Using a needle, thread and a whipstitch she sutured the incision.  He sat up and looked at her for the first time. She patted his head ever so lightly. He knew all for the first time. He saw his mother sitting there, tears in her eyes with medium sized hands.
The gray concrete walls are patterned with trowel combed waves. I finger a chip, heart shaped, jagged with sand and bits of rock. Condensation collects in my hand.   Gill tapping on his keyboard makes the sound of popping corn. Moans on the editing monitors swell into the room. â€œThat cock-shot could be better.â€  On the desk chip grease seeps through the white paper bag, now translucent like fine skin. In a stretch I can see the skylight, metal wire meshed between pieces of glass, dividing the sky up above.   Someoneâ€™s burning toast. Smoke curls hang from the ceiling.   â€œDo we have another shot of his ass?â€  Â·  Trapped beneath          smoke curls
2/10/04    Coffee beans, roasting. Percolating conversations. Traffic. Shouting. Clanging homeless cups of change, spiritual hymns punctuated by coughing, the buzz of BART underneath the street.   Piles of shit. Smelly awful shit. 16th and Capp, the Missionâ€™s toilet. Pigeons. Lots and lots of pigeons. People and pigeons, pigeon-people. Donâ€™t feed the birds, donâ€™t feed the birds.   Busted. Cop lights. Blue and red. Swipe employees smoking cigarettes in the garage. Smelly smoke curls hanging from the ceiling. Grecian goddess hair.    2/11/04    Fallen Angels. A concrete wall with a heart chipped out of the center. Shallow and cold, I can run my finger across it and feel the roughness of sand and stone. Trowel marks combed through the surface make waves, gentle undulating waves, the rush of the traffic outside is the water.   Watermarks drip down to the wooden floor. Damp walls, rusty boltsâ€”looks like urination marks. I bet theyâ€™re urination marks.    2/12/04    Lights, camera, action! â€œOut of all new HIV cases world wide, 30% are white.â€ Should that be Caucasian? Sirens and busses fly by as I talk into the camera. â€œFour fluids transmit HIV: Seamen, Blood, Breast Milk and Vaginal Fluids.â€ I was the only person to get that right today. Ding-ding-ding! I wanted to snicker when I said â€œvaginal fluids.â€   Passers by stop and gawk for seconds before moving to the corner to drink from brown paper bags and shoot craps.   â€œWhenâ€™s this going to be on?â€ I ask.   â€œTuesday. Tell us more. Tell us your story. Tell us a story about you.â€   â€œDo we have that much time?â€    2/13/04    Noisy bus crowded with peopleâ€”body odor mixed with 100 proof cheap liquor. Burrito in hand, chip grease seeping out the white paper bag, now translucent like fine skin. I get off. A kit of pigeons whirl, swirl, twirl in the air as if caught by a tornado. A chill in shadowed air, uncomfortable, fleecing body heat. Homeless man wrapped up in newspaperâ€”yesterdayâ€™s NY Times, I havenâ€™t read it, the article I want is beneath his right torn shoe. I wonder if I can jimmy it without him knowing?    2/15/04    Pin teeth, little daggers, the puppy is chewing on me. Humping my leg, at 9 weeks-old, that seems too young.   Feed him sausage, freeze-dried lamb lung, I can see the bronchial branches. Theyâ€™re beautiful, garnet red in tan cases; the puppy thinks theyâ€™re tasty.   Pee puddles on the floor. The carpet repels them. It sits on top like a liquid glacier, mercury from a broken thermometer.   Itâ€™s warm in the apartment. The gas heater is open fully. I could bake cookies. I could go down the street and show off Stewie. I could nap.   Napping sounds good.   Stewieâ€™s breath smells like puppy chow. Puppy breath is stinky.

Upon returning from Sunday school in our best We watched with rapture the sacrifice Of what would be our meals for months to come.  The skinning tree in the front yard All the kids came to watch The pealing of flesh from Deer and boars, the sawing Of the feet to help drain the blood.  The knife which resided on my father's hip Now in his hand, parting the belly to spill the guts A feast for flies which waited on the ground.  "Can I have the tail?" one kid would ask. "Only if your mother doesn't get upset." And off the kid ran with his new souvenir Gleefully waving it around frightening the girls.  The rope on the tree hung all year round Never being loosened, strangling the branch The grass never grew Where the blood had emptied Leaving brown patches vacant of verve.  The dry scent of fresh death Loitered on the wind Assaulting noses and stomachs, inducing gags But somehow the hunters reveled in the foulness Covering their bodies with the ends of the beast.
Staring and sitting the women snicker, loose heads bopping back and forth like dashboard ornaments or chickens pecking for food, and they cluck and cackle about me for they are too weary with their own lives that they must comment on mine.
I saw a woman jiggling her belly. Nose large as a kitchen cabinet knob, her hair in rollers bigger than soda cans. A tattered handkerchief on top of those cans, tied with a knot hoping to stifle her hair. Laughing, laughing, laughing, having a good time-- watching the dryer spin 'round and 'round.
Once white, stained yellow Shelled enamel fixture I gently respect In the temple of  Mint riding torrent malodor-- My nose takes office, I  Take aim with one-eyed Pete And add my essence, stron As asparagus to the soup Made earlier by tens of men. I do not flush for crimes Come from cleanliness.
The matchstick men jump out Of there boxed cars Red bald grainy heads upon pale Soft wooden pole bodies-- Longing to burn some idea Into ashes and soot. When they fins a queer belief They scratch their heads And ponder why They so easily go up in flames.

I often wonder what it is like to be perfect... the I think about Barbie and Ken, and I say hmmmmmmmmm, no genitalia that is what it must be like to be perfect.
The blood of the sun Puddle in the sky A choir of birds chanted unto dusk Bringing the cloak of night to veil What was left on the earth beneath.  In the valley Steeds of destiny danced Jubilantly across the soaked fields. Once mighty men fell, Making this their infinite grave On the soil they did not call home.  Raptured souls with bodies strewn Murdered marionettes, their wires cut Loose and limp they lie In numbers too great to count.  Only the horizon laments A requiem unheard For no one was left to listen Except for the choir of birds.
I pray for a release sweetened Via the hands I know Culminating the joy of etched tissue Dribbling my syrupy essence  Guard it, honor it, and await it Billowing in the tepid water Not unlike the tea leaves Trapped betwixt the cloth  Auriferous, my ore is automatic Though few gain its value So I plead freedom Grant me the passage The words and the sluice To which my furture may flow  Although the tides bring capricious Raptures and reveries.
Every Sunday I am told God hates me The preacher spits from his pulpit I'm an abomination to the Lord's nation  Immoral as a murderer he states Quoting a text thousands of years old I hear Leviticus, I hear Proverbs, I hear Names I do not know and laws I do not follow.  And each Sunday the sheep raise limbs And speak with a thousand tongues And pray for me so deeply I wish I could die  Stab me in these eyes So I may be blind -- the only way I'll seek mercy.  They say I should burn in Hell, Or be tossed down a bottomless well, Cast me into a Lake of Fire Burn me with their humanly desires.  I have been presented with enough 1)Guilt 2)Shame 3)Blame I could star in my own religion.  Ask for forgiviness I am told to pray Each and every day By the church goers Who are supposed to be like kin But don't they understand In order to be forgiven  I HAVE TO BELIEVE IN SIN?  To all of them Who don't turn a cheek, If it were all about an eye for an eye We'd all be blind.  I am here today to say I AM THAT TO WHICH I PRAY  So take your hate and throw it away  I am here today to say I AM THAT TO WHICH I PRAY  I am that to which I pray.
I wrote words before I knew poetry. I wrote poetry before I knew stories. I wrote stories before I knew me.
Bethany watched the blood of the sun puddle into the valley. She pressed her forehead against the back window of her fatherâ€™s 1956 BelAir that sped along Interstate 5. Her vaporous breath emerged and faded with the same cadence as the song on the AM radio. Making an â€œOâ€ with her mouth she exhaled deeply onto the glass. Bethany took her index finger and carved two dots and a downward curve into the humid blotch creating a face with a frown. It was the last hour of her familyâ€™s journey to their new home.  A small salt colored church materialized on the red horizon. Bethanyâ€™s father exclaimed, â€œThere it is. Our new home!â€  Bethany took the palm of her hand and rubbed the sad face out of existence. She scooted up in her seat popping her head between her parents in the front to take a look at where they would be living. She was twelve years old and very much still a little girl with her blond hair braided into pigtails. As the church grew larger she could see the parsonage, across the parking lot of the main building. A large cross stood in the parking lot with a sign that read Calvary Temple. Bethany had hoped something would have stuck out to make this new place interesting. She leaned back into her seat and sighed to herself, â€œitâ€™s just like the last one.â€  Bethany jumped out of the car. She flapped her arms like birdwings. Running to the picture window of the house she peered inside. â€œI canâ€™t believe it,â€ she yelled back to her mother, â€œits got the same blue carpeting as our last house!â€  â€œBlue is my favorite color,â€ her mother replied in a saccharine voice. She closed the passenger door. â€œHoney, check to see if our moving boxes have been delivered at the rear.â€  Bethany took off around the corner of the house running to a cyclone fence. She flipped the latch on the gate kicking it open and scuffing her black and white saddle shoes. She stepped into the backyard and looked at the back porch. There sat the majority of her familyâ€™s possessions packed into cubes of russet cardboard. She surveyed the boxes reading her mothers looping handing writing: kitchen dishes, picture frames, bathroom, Bethanyâ€™s toys and with seeing the last box she ripped open the top to free her belongings. â€œSorry guys,â€ she whispered sweetly, â€œI hope it wasnâ€™t too stuffy in there.â€   Spinning around to look over the yard Bethany noticed there was one tree. Itâ€™s gnarled branches jutted out in every direction and she looked at it with a little bit of awe. The tree had leaves that looked like slender emerald hands. Bethany walked up to the tree to inspect it closer in the dimming twilight. She noticed green-tinged purple buds at the bottom of most of the leaves.  â€œBethany,â€ her father called out. She jumped around and stood at attention. â€œWhere are you?â€  â€œIn the back yard,â€ she sang. She ran back towards the front of the house. â€œThe boxes are here! The boxes are here!â€
My palm was read last night. I have two distinct lines right near each other-- the upper line mirrors my ideals, the lower line mirrors my reality. The two do not meet.
Last night was Stewieâ€™s first puppy class, sans Stewie. The instructor is a big old queen. We were taught how to respond to our puppies and shit like that. I canâ€™t see Jim doing any of these things because heâ€™s ultra WASPy. If he has to use hand gestures Iâ€™m afraid heâ€™ll have a seizure. There were two gay couples in the class. One set trendy guys with a poodle and the others were bearish guys with a lab. It was very clichÃ©. The poodles owners have two poodles and they have these ridiculous French names that I canâ€™t remember. One of them sounds like â€œMildew.â€  There was one woman in there that has a pit mix and she kept saying, â€œI canâ€™t get Bear to come. I say, 'come Bear. Bear come. Come Bear. Bear come."  I laugh "Have you tried stimulating her clit?"   Thereâ€™s another woman in there that has a poodle that doesnâ€™t listen to herâ€”she said, â€œI donâ€™t know if I have the worse dog in there world or if Iâ€™m the worse owner. My dog doesnâ€™t listen. And she bites. And she draws blood. And she tears everything up. And she doesnâ€™t know her name. And sheâ€™s an alcoholic. Sheâ€™ll find any bottle of alcohol in the house and break it and then drink the contents. And she took a chunk out of my ear. But she doesnâ€™t bite anyone else, only me.â€  â€œHello Victim.â€  There are these treat bags that we can use, that are like modified fanny packs. Iâ€™m tempted to get one and wear it into work and when ever someone does something good Iâ€™ll toss them some cut up hot dog
I was getting a salad at a sandwich shop on Mission, a very cramped spaceâ€” only a few people can be in the shop at one time. There happened to be four of us in there on Tuesday when in walked two more customers. I didnâ€™t bother to turn around but the owner of the shopâ€™s face lit up.   A gravelly hoarse voice ordered a deluxe "light on the bacon but not because Iâ€™m watching my weight.â€ I turned slightly and saw it was a publicly elected official (PEO). I turned back around, not to give him any satisfaction that I recognized him as well.   I felt an inexplicable brush to my bottom followed by that hoarsely voice saying "pardon me." The PEO, in a black suit, had slipped behind me to get closer to the counter. Whatâ€™s more curious was the manner in which he slipped by.   People have two choices (perhaps moreâ€” but two tried and true methods) of passing one another in tight places. The first: a â€œcheek-2-cheekâ€ pass in which the passing person turns his or her back to the other person and moves accordingly. The second: the â€œspooningâ€ method where the person passes as if he or she were spooning the other person, much like the bed cuddling method. PEO employed the latter technique.   Yes, the PEO spooned me. Such intimacy in my mind obviously puts the two of us on a first name basis from now on.   One pass is acceptable. Twoâ€” ok, he obviously has to get back by. However the third spooning pass was nothing more than gratuitous. I believe there was even a little shaky-shaky in there to rouse my interests.  If youâ€™re wondering, I discerned he wears briefs and his wife probably isn't satisfied. Not because of his deficent pole size, but she seems to be a... errr, yeah.   PEO-- Call me.
Have you ever eaten the steak, egg and cheese bagel from McDonaldâ€™s? The reason I ask is because Iâ€™m really interested in whether or not itâ€™s real steak. It doesnâ€™t really look like steak. It looks scary. Mystery meat.   I stopped by the golden arches this morning to get some coffee. Surprisingly (or not so) San Francisco has one Starbucks per person. Yet there is not a Starbucks anywhere near where I work because itâ€™s crack-head central (well it probably shares the dubious honor with the intersection of Taylor/Market/Sixth Street) thus Iâ€™m forced to either go to Muddy Waters a few blocks away or enter Micky Dâ€™s two-hundred and thirty-four steps from work. Whatâ€™s this about? Do crack heads not need a cup of coffee? Regardless of your take on Starbucks it has set the standard (albeit low to average) for how coffee and some other beverages should taste.  Anyway, as always the lid doesnâ€™t fit the top of the cup so I spilt. That annoys me. A homeless man that stakes out the front of McDonaldâ€™s opened the door for me thinking he was going to get some change. Iâ€™m sorry but youâ€™re not at the Plaza and Iâ€™m fully capable (despite obvious contentions) to open a door by myself. *said like Soup Nazi* â€œNO CHANGE FOR YOU!â€  There was this little crack-whore chick in McDâ€™s who had a dried bloody nose. Doesnâ€™t she have a mirror? DOH!
Stewie was a bad boy last night. When I got to the apartment he had: pulled down the baby gate in the kitchen door jam, tore the curtains off the front door and shredded them, taken down three jackets & four baseball caps to chew on, pooped under the bed, peed on an Ohio State sweatshirt, had the stereo remote on the floor, over turned a vase of flowers, cleared off the dinning table, taken all the trash from the bathroom and strewn it down the hall, and took the roll of toilet paper and ran it through the house.  Heâ€™s obviously on Puppy PCP. Weâ€™ll be holding an intervention later this week. Iâ€™m going to have to send him off to rehab.  I attend Kindergarten w/o him this Thursday.
People probably assume that I am laughing at them, not with them. Last night in class, my friend Courtney and I kept giving each other these looks of â€œOMGâ€ every time someone said: 1) something stupid, 2) something stupid, 3) something stupid, 4) something stupid. The people in this particular class are real characters. The regular CW students are humdrum, but the Playwriting students are impassioned weirdoesâ€”they are so funny to watch and listen. Thereâ€™s this one whoâ€™s a bearish type guy, total musical queen, who says things like, â€œI donâ€™t even read the critics. I have this saying â€˜I agree with critics when they write something good about my show and I disagree with everything else.â€ He followed that lame statement with a chortle. Not enough people chortle. Thereâ€™s this one woman who speaks with a neuvo-riche Martha Stewart accent, â€œMarlowe was such a wonderful playwright. His last words were either curse words, or they werenâ€™t. He was stabbed either above the left eye, or the right.â€ She followed that statement with short warbles and then â€œItâ€™s so interestingâ€ which is her equivalent of â€œItâ€™s a good thing.â€  Then the Professor slid in this comment about the amazing actress who we saw perform last week in Ibsenâ€™s â€œGhosts.â€ â€œI had drinks with Ellen after the performanceâ€¦â€ and one could see tinges of jealousy among the playwrights. Clenched fists and false grins.
Rice Pushers  I went and got a burrito at Poncho Villas. I said, â€œno riceâ€ and the chick making my burrito said, â€œNo rice? You no want rice? No rice?â€ She said it in a manner as if by me not getting rice I would be putting millions of rice farmers out of business.  â€œYeah, no rice.â€ Have I mentioned my disdain for rice pushers? Every time I go out for Asian food it the same thing. â€œHow much rice you wanâ€™, nuff for two people?â€   â€œI DONâ€™T WANT ANY!!!!â€  â€œNo rice? You no want rice? No rice? When I little girl growin up on rice patty, we no have enuff money for food. All we eatâ€”rice. Rice good for you. You need eat rice, nuff for two people!â€  â€œNO!!!!!â€  Then they always bring out rice and then I tell â€˜em not to charge me for it since I wonâ€™t eat it. Pushy, pushy, pushy.
The cool thing about looking like a Who from Whoville is all the free roast beast.
Her voice was a victim-arpeggio of trembles. She stepped up into the bus. â€œI-I-I need to get to 9th Street to pick up my welfare check.â€   Bus Driver: â€œYou need to pay.â€   Woman: â€œI-Iâ€™m going to pick up my welfare check. I donâ€™t have any money. W-w-wonâ€™t you help me out.â€   By this time sheâ€™s moved pass the bus driver and has sat down behind him trying to hide.   Bus Driver: â€œYou need to pay to be on the bus.â€   I put down my book and look at my watch. I want to get to work on time and the bus driver is not moving the bus until she pays. Iâ€™m annoyed.   Bus Driver: â€œYou have to pay.â€   Homeless woman: â€œW-w-wonâ€™t anyone help me out? Put 35 cents in my cup so I can pay? Please!â€ She begins to sob.   Me: â€œYou can WALK. Itâ€™s only two blocks!â€   Homeless woman: â€œW-w-wonâ€™t anyone help me out? 35 cents? 35 cents?â€   Me: â€œGet off! You can walk!â€   Bus driver: â€œIâ€™m not moving this bus until you pay.â€   Homeless woman: â€œI donâ€™t have any money. Iâ€™m going to get my welfare check. 35 cents? 35 cents?â€   Me: â€œFuck you! Get the off the bus! How dare you hijack us like this. Youâ€™re going to make all of us late.â€   Girl next to me: â€œYeah, get the fuck off the bus!â€   Man at the back of the bus: â€œGet off!â€   Homeless woman: â€œ35 cents? 35 cents?â€   Then this woman walks up and puts 35 cents in the bus. That just pissed me off even more.   Me: â€œI canâ€™t believe it! Whyâ€™d you do that? Jesus Christ, now sheâ€™ll continue hijacking buses everywhere because people like you."   35 cent lady: â€œFuck you.â€   Me: â€œBitch, you wish you could.â€   Girl next to me: â€œWhat a cunt.â€   We get to 9th street and does she get off the bus? No.   â€œI have one more block.â€
Upon waking this morning my lower back was in such pain it had radiated out into my legs. I fumbled for some relief and thought I had found it in a bottle of Advil. I popped three beautiful blue liquid gels and hobbled to the bathroom to take a shower.  It wasnâ€™t long before I was doubled over in pain. I forgot that I canâ€™t take ibuprofen or naproxen anymore because it makes my stomach bleed. The horror of it all.   I schlepped to work regardless and have been sitting here alternating between clutching my belly and clutching my back. Then there are my legs which still hurt. Itâ€™s comedic on one level, on another itâ€™s just plain distressing.
My Easter Basket arrived home with me after a visit up at me mumâ€™s. I may be 26 years old but I havenâ€™t outgrown the Easter Bunny. Last year I gave up Easter egg hunts. Anyway upon my request, my sister was only allowed to buy me one piece of candy.   Whatâ€™s a girl to do in that situation? Having to restrain her impulses to buy hundreds of candy treatsâ€”she used her noggin and purchased just one piece of candy for me. Of course it was an chocolate Easter egg the size of a football!  I had left it in my truck where it melted quickly. Seeing as it was still edible I put it in the fridge to harden it up. It reminds me of the year I got my braces on. It was the day after Easter and I had a four pound solid chocolate bunny that I couldnâ€™t eat do to pain. However where thereâ€™s a will thereâ€™s a way. I got out a candle, a ladle and a knife. I hacked away at the bunny, put the pieces in the ladle and cooked it over the candle flame. I would then inhale the chocolate. Satisfaction. Freebasing off of chocolate bunny parts. Thereâ€™s nothing like it.
Chloroform tastes a lot like magic and unicorn poop.
The cool thing about looking like a Satanist is all the free music.
There was no sugar coating things when I was a child. I knew about the birds and the bees before anyone else my age. When it came to sex and drugs not a lot was left up to my imagination.  My dad would come home everyday from work at noon for â€œlunchâ€ and he and my mom would go have sex in their bedroom while I watched cartoons in the living room. I canâ€™t tell you how many times Iâ€™ve walked in on them. I once saw my mom giving my dad head in the backyard. Not to mention how many Polaroids Iâ€™ve seen, which makes embarrassing my mom extremely easy.  â€œRemember that time you sent me out to the car to get money out of your purse? Well I found those pictures dad took of you in the motel. I didnâ€™t know your asshole was so hairy.â€  Sheâ€™s mercurially modest, sheâ€™ll still walks around the house naked unless someone makes a comment about it, then all of a sudden sheâ€™s bashful. She looks a lot like those busty ladies in the movies, her boobs swaying like jungle vines.
Tonight I listened to Thom Gunn speak.   He dressed in faded blue 501's, black motorcycle boots with the silver ring on the side and a black leather jacket. He looked very 1970's despite being in his 70's. He was rather humble in regards to his work. He read poems that dealt with several different themes, but some of the most interesting took place here in San Francisco. Bars in SOMA such as The Hole in the Wall and the Lone Star.  Afterwards I went and had him sign my book.  He said, "Do we know one another?"  "No, we do not."  "You smile as if we do. I remember your smile."  He was flirting with me.
My weekend happened to be low-key. Saturday Stewie and I hung out until Amy showed up in the evening. Amy and I decided to go get some dinner and I pointed out porn stars and explained the hanky code to her. While eating a man sat down behind Amy and pulled out three new porn DVDs. I pointed this out to Amy and she did the best, sly-stretch-look-over-the-shoulder number Iâ€™ve seen in years.  She said, â€œI wonder what heâ€™s going to be doing tonight?â€  â€œYou do realize that heâ€™s taking out his right hand for a romantic dinner.â€ Then I took my hand and formed a fist and placed it by Amy, â€œI donâ€™t want pasta, I want your little cock!â€  She died laughing.  Her funeral is on Wednesday.
Iâ€™m obsessed. Last night the mouse taxidermy at  urlLink Paxton Gate  visited me in a dream. This time, the mouse was dressed like Patty Hearst, holding a machine gun in front of a Symbionese Liberation Army flag.   My favorite mouse-dreamt-taxidermy has been the Charo mouse that wore a red sequined gown. It kept saying â€œChoochie-choochie.â€ That was hot.
Sexual Innuendo, Hard-ons, Delusion and Projections:   Is it a good sign?  Here are my thoughts, being a tech savvy and emotionally literate person, with extensive empirical data collected over the past nine years. Anytime one sees someone online via a personal there has to be a certain amount of projection on the part of the viewer. We read about a person who weâ€™ve deemed attractive. This either fires more interests or quickly quells the flame. After contact has been established once again thereâ€™s either more interest or none at all. Throughout this process, one thing Iâ€™ve learned to do is to keep low to moderate expectations on the other person. Early on, I would build someone into this monolithic person who he would never be able to live up toâ€” which wasnâ€™t fair to him or fair to me.   This also leads me to questions whatâ€™s currently going on in my life and what I feel my specific needs are. Am I looking for friendship, just looking to get my rocks off, or is there something between the two.
Did you know that it takes 40 minutes to hard-boil an ostrich egg? An ostrich egg is the equivalent to 24 chicken eggs.
People are raining on my parade, not that I have any floats or a marching band following me around, though the idea has crossed my mind to hire people to snap my picture as I walk through the streets so I can gnash my teeth and intermittently yell â€œDamn you Paparazzi!â€

Nothing says "Welcome Home" better than seeing my roommate's trick leaving.
I walked over to Rainbow Grocery on my lunch break deciding to cut down shorter alleys instead of meandering thoroughfares. Down one alley I came across one woman who was in the middle of doing her â€œbusiness.â€  Squatting, she moved her head up and down, an apparent strain on her face. Then it happened. A large cacophonous explosion came from her nether regions. The pigeons a few feet away took off in a flurry. Apparently not only was Montezuma getting his revenge but auntie Flo was visiting as well.  Normally I would have felt embarrassed stumbling upon this scene, but I guess Iâ€™ve been in the Mission too long now and itâ€™s become routine.  She grabbed at a pile of papers and trash and began to clean herself up. It did not matter that I was witnessing this scene. No apologies made, none expected. I did however wish I carried around tampons or at the least toilet paper to hand out during these encounters.
Shakespeare balanced tragedy with levity.   I stood on Castro Street in front of Cliffâ€™s around 8:50 PM. Monica was supposed to meet me in A Different Light Bookstore at 9. I had gone into the store with the intention of skimming through the new arrivals. I didnâ€™t want guys skimming me as the new arrival so I left soon there after.  I stood on the sidewalk. Originally I was facing the street but I couldnâ€™t see if Monica was coming. It takes quite a bit of courage to actually face the guys who walk up and down the street. A guy will walk pass and without turning his head look me up and down. Itâ€™s unnerving. No matter how uncomfortable I was I stood my ground and waited.  Monica and Heather showed up and we chatted before making our way to Harveyâ€™s. Monica and I were set on listening to the last message from her stalker but we couldnâ€™t get her voicemail to work. We were met outside the bar by another of Monicaâ€™s friends, Joie, dressed up in a cowboy shirt and jeansâ€”perfect for  urlLink Trannyshackâ€™s â€œWomen of Country.â€   Inside we staked our claim, near Hecklina and waited for Tom to show up. The show began and it seemed like all the drama from earlier melted away with the antics of the performers. Monicaâ€™s friends with all the queens so itâ€™s nice to go to these events with her because I can feel like a part of the show. It was exactly the space I needed to be in-- far enough away from Fell Street and the events of the evening.  Three hours flew by and I found myself bidding everyone adieu as a cab took me up over the hill back to the crime scene. I walked into the condo greeted by the hum of the clothes dryer. Walking into my room I fell on my bed picturing the body in the bathroom, over and over again.
My roommate pounded on my bedroom door. Nine minutes into my disco nap I popped out of bed. Half dressed I went to the door.  "Can you answer the door for the paramedics. WE have situation here."  I glanced towards the bathroom. A body lay on the tile, light brown limbs akimbo, naked.  The sight didn't surprise me. I didn't ask any questions. A few weeks ago I found out that I my roommate liked to party and play. This apparently was one of the consequences.  I opened the front door.  I was going to hop down the three flights of stairs to the foyer but decided I really should be wearing shoes. So I went back to my bedroom and pulled on a pair of Adidas.  My roommate tried to talk to the guy in the bathroom. "Are you awake? Stay with me." I couldn't discern if there was real concern in his voice.  I went back out only to be met by one of the paramedics halfway up the stairwell.   "Hey, how's it going?" I asked as if we were old friends.  "There are going to be a lot of people following me up" he replied walking pass me into the condo.   "Um OK."  "What's going on here? What's the situation?" the medic grilled my roommate.  Their voices became indiscernible as they filled up the bathroom but I did make out "craigslist."   I left the door open and walked back to my room. Outside two fire trucks and one ambulance had gathered. A woman yelled out "We're going to need a stair chair!"  In the kitchen and hallway a medic carnival had sprung up. The naked trick was brought in front of my bedroom door. The first paramedic was barking orders and trying to get the man to regain consciousness.   "Can you hear me? Squeeze my finger? Can you hear me?"  "Who has the stair chair?"  Soon he was on his way out the door. As fast as the carnival was up it came down. I heard the ambulance pull away from the curb without sirens.  Fifteen minutes later my roommate had put the towels from the bathroom into the washing machine. I heard doors close before I walked out, now fully clothed. I looked over the place. If I had not been there I would have never known what had happened.  I'm not sure I like knowing what happened.
As part two of Nickâ€™s Birthday Extravaganza commenced, we found ourselves at the  urlLink RADAR Reading Series  at the SF Public Library. We had been in regular attendance to the series until this past February when the new semester of State began. Fortunately I had already heard a good number of my favorite writers perform, such as  urlLink Laurie Weeks  and  urlLink Eileen Myles .   The incomparable (albeit a clichÃ© term)  urlLink Michelle Tea  emcees this bastion of the literary underworld. Sheâ€™s infectious with upbeat demeanorâ€”a mix of spunky punk ultra cool Mission chick and sisterly down home charm. She extorts the crowd with her freshly baked cookies, dolling them out only if someone asks a question of the writers.  The line up of writers was  urlLink Eddy Joe Cotton ,  urlLink Thea Hillman ,  urlLink Kirk Read  and Chelsea Starrâ€”the latter of whom Iâ€™m convinced moonlights as a Peachy Puff Girl.  After getting our seats I noticed Thea Hillman putting her stuff down in front of Nick and myself. I said hello, however Thea didnâ€™t remember who I was despite meeting me a few times before. I seem to have this non-effect on people; Iâ€™m quite forgettableâ€”possibly because it makes me uncomfortable to gain any acceptance within a group of people because I fear loosing my outsider/edge status.  I re-met Kirk Read who knows Nick. We had read at an event together a couple years previous but he had snubbed me there so I just chalked it up to cattiness. I do enjoy his stories, theyâ€™re pretty outrageous.   My favorite story of the evening was by Chelsea Starr. It was a memoir piece from her childhood in Oregon. It hit very close to home.  After the reading Nick and I went to Carlâ€™s Junior, enjoyed our Western Bacon Cheeseburgers while watching all the crack whores and homeless wander about.  Martuniâ€™s was our last stop of the evening. We opened the back room and sat in a dark corner. Before too long Nickâ€™s friends Geno and Devon showed up and we laughed the night away.  It was a great way to close down his 2 day fiesta.
Last night was Nicky Pickle's 27th Birthday Party Extravaganza Part I. He decided to have it at the  urlLink Rite Spot CafÃ© . About 14 friends showed up for this last minute bash. The dinner coincided with Suzanne Ramsey AKA  urlLink Kitten on the Keys  performing. Sheâ€™s HILARIOUS. Such a hoot.  Scott, whose birthday party was last Friday at Aunt Charlieâ€™s in the Tenderloin, met up with me there. Heâ€™s probably one of the more adorable affable guys in San Francisco. A real good egg. He owns Piggy the Pug, the best play pal any Jack Russell could ever want. Stewie loves to hump Piggy and she obliges him readily.  Dinner and drinks with Kitten on the Keys, who sang songs about Hot Nuts, a grandma who sold her granddaughterâ€™s panties on eBay and a song about Heinous the Hamster who like to go up anuses. All the while being crude and funny, scratching her ass and burping into the mic. Nick requested Bohemian Rhapsody and she did one of the best renditions Iâ€™ve ever heard. She wrapped up with the title song on her new Album â€œItâ€™s Not a Pretty Princess Dayâ€ and I think two of our party members even got to see her un-pantied crotch when she lifted up her pink gingham checked dress. HOT!  We wrapped the night up by walking to catch cabs and public transportation.
During the summer my mom used Vacation Bible School as a babysitter. Sheâ€™d enroll my sister and me in the VBS Circuit. Starting at the First Baptist Church, weâ€™d work our way to First Presbyterian, then on to Evangelical Free and finally wrapping up at the home of Lacto-ova Vegetarians, the Seventh Day Adventist.    At each stop weâ€™d be taken aside by a VBS counselor, some woman in her 30â€™s who yearned for children of her own but was barren do to sins, and told to pray for Jesus to come into our hearts. I never understood why Jesus would leave my heart each week. Didnâ€™t he like it in there? Was I eating too much spicy food? Talk about abandonment issues.  At the Seventh Day Adventist church weâ€™d get to sing â€œOnward Christian Soldiersâ€ as we marched into the sanctuary carrying banners and trumpets. Some kids even rode horses in.  Thereâ€™d be a rack set up behind the pulpit for our daily inquisition of a town heathen. It was rad.  After the torture Iâ€™d make my way to art class where I would freak out at a picture of a green Satan fleeing from a wooden heart shaped door of an English country side cottage, Jesus on the inside peeking out. This was supposed to represent my heartâ€” but I knew Jesus had hightailed it because of the enchiladas I had the night before and that the green devil was going to squat.
While riding the bus this morning, three men got on at the junkie-halfway house stop. Rough and tumbled, they lumbered to the back of the bus where I was sitting. They didnâ€™t quite look like new recruits to the halfway-house. I reveled in the possibility of who they were.  One of them looked like he had just walked out of prison, leaving behind in the pen his Neo-Nazi brethren. He of course was the most attractive with his shaved head and  mustache. He was wearing white Dickie overalls and sunglasses which was peculiar on a foggy drippy San Francisco morning.   I felt a certain kinship as I too was wearing sunglasses.  Much to my delight, they started chatting. Among the topics they covered was a list of employers that would hire felons. Good to know my criminaldar is finely tuned. The conversation soon turned to the best way to off a wife, how to send people in boxes to remote locations and how much alcohol one can drink while still wielding a hammer.  Obviously these men werenâ€™t bright. One said, â€œYou should send to her in a box to the Dead Sea. Maybe sheâ€™d get eaten by a killer whale.â€  Um, OK. I have a sneaking suspicion they never covered geography or the fauna of the Israel/Jordan region in Shiv Making 101.
My sister phoned to tell me a story concerning my nephew Trenton (age 5) and what went down at his last t-ball game.  While playing second base Trent caught a ball. He tagged second base, which technically means the runner from first is out. But for safe measure, Trenton charged the kid and tagged him with the ball as well. Overjoyed, Trenton shouted at the kid â€œYOUâ€™RE OUT!â€ and proceeded to jump up and down. â€œYouâ€™re outta here. I tagged you out! Youâ€™re out!!!â€ Ah, Iâ€™m amazed at what good sportsman like conduct he shows at such a tender age.  If that werenâ€™t enough. He did it a second time, however this time while rejoicing he yelled, â€œI got the  brown  boy out!â€  Brown was not the boyâ€™s last name. Both the coach of the team and the umpire expressed their concern/indignation for such a comment. My sister-in-law was embarrassed to say the leastâ€” but what does she expect when her child is being raised by rednecks?
Return to Witch Mountain is on the Hallmark channel and I canâ€™t help but watch it. As a kid I loved this movie. I distinctly remember wishing that I had alien powers that could levitate me over gates and the alike. I even remember holding my own hands at Frank Zeek Elementary and flinging myself onto the cyclone fence only to scrape up my face.  Looking at the movie now, Iâ€™m fascinated not so much by the terrible acting (Bette Davis does a pretty good job at being an old bitch, whoâ€™d a thunk?) but how San Francisco looked in the 1970â€™s. It was such a different place from the San Francisco of 2004.   My earliest memories of San Francisco take place in the early â€˜80â€™s and have to do with Chinatown, the Sutro Baths, Playland, Fishermanâ€™s Warf, etc. I remember distinctly getting hamburgers at the Wendyâ€™s on Market Street when I was 8 and my parents making us take them outside to eat. We werenâ€™t allowed to sit down out side because according to my mother, â€œvagabonds pee everywhere.â€  This is where levitating powers would come in handy. I could have floated above the sidewalk, taking care not to pick up vagrant urine particles on my shoes.  The movie keeps being interrupted with commercials (duh.) There basically all Hallmark commercials for motherâ€™s day. The people on the screen are hawking Motherâ€™s Day Locket Ornaments. Itâ€™s disgusting. Ugly. However after watching about six of these commercials Iâ€™m drawn to buy one.
Drama, drama, drama I made you out of clay, drama, drama, drama a game the whole family playsâ€¦

My Craigslist Advert  Date: 2004-06-16, 2:39PM PDT   Hey Yâ€™all,   Iâ€™m a 27 year-old gay Nor Cal native who has lived in SF for the past 3.5 years. Iâ€™m looking to move into a place mid-July â€“ beginning of August. I'm willing to spend 500-700 clams for a room; more coin if the place is truly worth it. I want the place, as clichÃ© as it sounds, to be home sweet home.   During the weekdays I work as an Intellectual Property Paralegal for a multimedia company in the Mission. (Feel free to ask me about it because it is quite interesting. The 3 Pâ€™s: Peer2Peer, Porn and Politics.) At night I can be found at SFSU finishing up their Creative Writing program. Each semester is different so my schedule changes. The weekends I chill out with friends or go on road trips.   Iâ€™m affable and easy to get along with. I donâ€™t do the passive-aggressive thing, so you wonâ€™t see notes tagged up on the fridge or a list of everything you do that drives me crazy (weâ€™ve all been there havenâ€™t we?) Any challenges that arise I feel should be nipped in the bud before they become unmanageable. I like to keep common areas clean and I donâ€™t freak out if thereâ€™s a glass in the sink. Iâ€™m looking for roommate(s) that feel the same.   I donâ€™t drink or swear or rat my hair... Actually I donâ€™t smoke or do drugs though I do have the occasional libation. I eat meat and it doesnâ€™t bother me if you happen to be Vegan or Vegetarian. Itâ€™s all good in my book. 420 friendly, but I donâ€™t smoke.   Having a rather irreverent sense of humor sets me apart from most everyone else youâ€™ll meet. Iâ€™m a cross between Harold from â€œHarold and Maudeâ€ and Enid from â€œGhost Worldâ€ Everyday I choose a Daily Hero to obsess over (though my obsession is quite mild and almost apatheticâ€” â€œIâ€™m obsessed with _______â€ and thatâ€™s usually where it ends.) Iâ€™m a hopeless blogger. Iâ€™m a hopeless jogger. Iâ€™m just an ogger.   I have to mention as part of my paroleâ€” just kidding. Iâ€™ve never been incarcerated or for that matter have yet to do anything worthy of being incarcerated for.   I am toting a pet. She lives in a cage, is quiet and well mannered and exclusively will stay in my room. I like dogs, cats, birds and exotics.   As I mentioned, I work in the Mission. Iâ€™d like to find some place close enough to work but far enough away. Ideal neighborhoods for me are Castro/Upper Market, Noe Valley, Ashbury Terrace/Cole Valley, Buena Vista Park, the Haight, and the Panhandle. Iâ€™d go to Pacific Heights, Russian Hill or Nob Hill if the place was just rightâ€”and thereâ€™s street parking. I own a small pickup and Iâ€™m not getting rid of it any time soon.   I encourage questions so please feel free to ask.   Thanks!   PS: While I'm articulate, I generally don't talk as much as I write unless I've eatten some kiddie cocaine AKA sugar; which would make me a lot like Chrissy from "Pecker"
I noticed on my sales receipt from Pac Sun that I purchased a $19 T-shirt and never received it. There was a two T-shirt deal for $25 that I was taking advantage of. However of the two shirts I picked out, one was not on sale and it was $19. So the counter person rang it up, told me about the price and asked if I wanted to pick out a new shirt. I said yes, thinking he was going to take the shirt off my billâ€¦  It took me 10 days to get back down to Pac Sun and when I explained my situation to the manager, who was younger than me, she said, â€œIâ€™ll do this for you this once.â€   All I could do was smile and think, â€œYouâ€™ll do this for me every time I ask. Iâ€™m the customer and you HAVE to make me happy. Neener-neener.â€
Iâ€™ll take part of what I wrote yesterday back. Walking to the Mission can be as interesting as listening to the junkies on the bus. Amazingly at 8:30 this morning above the BART station at 16th Street, the Mission had its very own cantor. Wide wild eyes, she was belting out the crazy at the top of her lungs. Heavy pendulous breast hung down her rather plump front side. Her breasts parted as she sucked in the air for her next bar of verse. She started stomping to her incantation and people on the pedestrian portion of their commutes tried to stay at a comfortable distance.  I however am not like other people and I proceeded right up next to her at the corner. She threw her head towards me, her eyes a big as moons, â€œDonâ€™t you know! Donâ€™t you know! Donâ€™t you know!â€ she wailed as the chorus.   Looking into those eyes I said, â€œI do.â€  She stomped her feet five times and breathed in a bottomless breath. I however had to cross the street and left her there as she serenaded me with â€œHe knows! He knows! He knows!â€
Iâ€™ve got to admitâ€” when I donâ€™t ride the bus in the morning Iâ€™m kind of sad. Walking to work lacks color. Today I counted how many people I saw driving while talking on cellular phones. The total count: 46 in 15 blocks. Listening to the junkies is a lot more fun.  One of the other drags of walking to work is all the human shit I come across. Especially on the street I work on. I guess Capp really is one of the Mission's toilets. The corner of 17th and Capp with its piles of shit, Burger KingÂ® wrappers sticking out of â€˜em, a hoard of flies, is one of the worse locations. If you havenâ€™t read  urlLink Fast Food Nation , then the site of a shit burger with flies is enough to keep you away from any fast food joint.
I woke up this morning in a kind of food induced stupor. Usually stupors are reserved for nights of beved out bliss but not last night as I binged on sushi, teriyaki and miso soup right before bedtime. Jim had kindly purchased the take out and brought it to me as I was finishing up watching Cassie and Stewie.  Miso might as well be called mescaline if eaten so close to bedtime. My night was interrupted by out of this world dreams and obviously nightmares (read below.)  One of the cats woke me up with a mew. Turning over to get into a more comfortable position on the king sized bed I saw a rather non-descript woman standing before me. I got up (in the dream of course.) She was showing me around a Pacific Heights home. She was trying to persuade me into staying there while she was away in New York City on extended business.   While leading me through the living roomâ€”her husband came home. I didnâ€™t look at him as he entered the room but felt his presence. When I turned to see him, I was embarrassed because I had been having torrid fuck-fest with this man for the past few weeks. I didnâ€™t know he was married and I didnâ€™t really care to know. He was just an anonymous Johnâ€”though not that anonymous as in my dream he turned out to beâ€¦  Gavin Newsom (but better looking.)  I said hello and followed his wife to the bedrooms. She had to take a phone call and while I was checking out the master bathroom he walked in and cornered me. He jumped my bones and I let him.  I must be hard up.  He explained to me how his wife was leaving but he'd be staying. I had to call the whole thing off. Imagine if the papers found out. I didn't need to be a San Francisco version of Monica Lewinsky.
The fog was extremely thick this morning. I got a leash on Stewie and decided that we should go out for a jog. Iâ€™m currently fighting an extra 17 pounds of winter weight that Iâ€™m positive is one of the reasons my back has been aching recently. We started out by the golf course in the neighborhood Iâ€™m house-sitting in.   It seems no one leashes their dogs. While heading down one street a cocker spaniel started to run after us. When we rounded the corner a German shepherd bounded out of his drive way. Stewie froze while I started sprinting, dragging his little ass behind me. When I rounded the corner the German shepherd handed the baton off to a mutt. It was like a doggie relay race.   I finally out ran the dogsâ€” Stewie was beside himself. I guess Iâ€™ll jog alone tomorrow.
Misty the dog peeked into the TV room while I was winding down this evening. She spends almost every moment in the office closet. I gather sheâ€™s around 8 years old. Originally from Costa Rica where the locales used to shoot her full of bullets as a sort of sport, my friends Alex and Charles rescued her when they lived there.   One ear is cocked crooked. Her eyes dart back and forthâ€”treading out of the safety space is a big deal. She looked over at me, but I was told not to stare because it makes her nervous. I kicked back on the sofa and flipped the television channels. She took a few steps into the room and then turned around and left. Progress.  Five minutes later she was back at the door. By this time I had curled up with some pillows. She checked behind her and then walked up to the couch. She jumped up and walked overâ€”never making eye contact and put her front paws on my lap. I extended my hand slowly. She sniffed it, her eyes darting back and forth to see who or what if anything was in the room.   I placed my hand on her head, slowly petting her. She adjusted herself. I traced her scars with my fingers. All I could think is how unbelievably cruel people can be. I spoke tenderly, â€œYouâ€™re such a good girl Misty. Good girl.â€  Misty began to soften although her hypersensitivity was still full on. She licked her lips a bit and edged herself even closer to me. Looking across the room to the door she decided to lay down. I ran my hand down the length of her body. Upon reaching her back thigh she lifted it up for me to pet her belly.  I felt honored.
Picture it: (A la Sophia Petrillo from Golden Girls)  Several lit Catholic votive pillar candles adding a soft glow to the bathroom. Surrounding them are little stuffed animals tied with ribbons, vases of flowers and a hand drawn card in crayon made by me. All of this in the bathroom where the trick had ODâ€™d.  The bathroom is now a shrine! Feel free to come over and weep there to annoy the fuck out of my unemployed roommate!
We all know or have seen this type of person. He wakes up in the morning and has a cigarette before even getting out of bed. On the way to the bathroom she has another cigarette before peeing. He smokes a cig in the shower. She smokes while doing her hair. He smokes while eating cereal. She smokes while drinking orange juice. By the time he or she gets on the bus, theyâ€™ve had three thousand morning cigarettes. The stench of smoke actually flakes off these people.  Well this morning, she got on the bus. A junkie from the rehab place (no judgmentsâ€”seriously.) She proceeded to shut all the windows as she ambled to the back to stake her seat claim. She approached the four seat area I was in and stopped to shut my window. Her smoke detritus crumbled onto my shoes.  â€œStop.â€  She looked at me with a donâ€™t-talk-to-me glare.  â€œDonâ€™t shut that window,â€ I said.  â€œIâ€™m cold.â€  I added â€œand you stink.â€  She went to close the window.  â€œStop.â€  She glared again at me.  â€œGo sit in the front where you already shut the windows.â€  â€œDonâ€™t tell me where to sit.â€  â€œDonâ€™t shut the window.â€  These bus battles are so silly.   â€œDonâ€™t tell me what to do.â€  â€œIf I were to tell you what to do, I say â€˜jump off a bridge.â€™ Just donâ€™t shut the window.â€  She acquiesced.   Iâ€™m an asshole before I have any caffeine in the morning.
Strolling up the street to take care of the green boogered Cassie (sheâ€™s got a respiratory infection) this guy gave me the Two-Thumbs Up Signâ„¢. I was confused. Was he commenting on my choice of clothing: boot cut jeans, my trademark HurleyÂ® sweatshirt, and sweat stained baseball cap? Could he hear the music I was listening to on my mp3 player? I didnâ€™t know Lucia Pamela was well known. Did he know that I went and saw Saved! Tuesday evening?   I guess Iâ€™ll never know.  ***  Cassie thought it would be cool to rub her flo-green boogies on me. It was pretty vile. She had green stained legs from where it had dripped. Dogs with infections are not pretty. She definitely was not having a Pretty Princess Day.  I decided that I should give her some percussion so I tapped her back all the while she coughed up phlegm. I felt just like Donna Reed, only I have a penis. (Itâ€™s true, I do, I do.)  After awhile I put Cassie to bed and then washed Jimâ€™s dishes which obviously had been piling up for two weeks. There was mold in some dishes. Ewww. But I jumped head first into the chore, basically rewarding myself with eating a half package of frozen chocolate chip cookie dough.
Steve (BOS) from Boston met up with me for lunch. I took him to Pancho Villas on 16th Street for a burrito. He was quite lucky to visit on such a day as all my favorite cracked out peeps were on the street.  We sat and I pointed out the guy behind BOS had dined at the pizza sliciery with me the other day when the dancing Juniata performed. Coincidentally one of my coworkers was sitting behind him as well. I waved to Charls who waved back at us and BOS did a few double takes which I feared might have made Charls feel like we were chatting about him. But we werenâ€™t. Look what Iâ€™m doing now: Charls youâ€™re in a blog entry!  Anyway, two Mariachis were performing and we wanted to inquire as to whether or not they knew some Titney Spears. I wanted BOS to feel at home and one of his co-workers listens to Titney often. They did not know any pop music, their loss.  After their performance one walked around with his hat looking for tips. These situations can be awkward. However having been to both Little League games and Churches where money is collected in the same way, Iâ€™m quite comfortable with not giving. Does this make me a bad person? Most certainly it does. But if they donâ€™t know any Titney Spearsâ€”no tip for them! :P  Lunch was good and BOS walked me back to my office building. Fortunately for us, when we turned the corner of 17th Street onto Capp, kneeling in the gutter a cracked out chick was curling her eyelashes in the side view mirror of a trashed out coupe. These moments are priceless.
While eating lunch at one of my favorite pizza-sliceries a woman, plump as Violet Beauregarde after eating the â€œby gum itâ€™s gumâ€ meal, rolled in. She ordered up her slice and then paced back and forth down the narrow room. She leaned up against the counter and in a jovial tone asked, â€œIs it done yet?â€  â€œNo,â€ was the reply.  She smiled and pace back and forth again only to lean up against the counter and ask, â€œIs it done yet?â€  â€œNo,â€ was the reply.  She didnâ€™t seem to get discouraged. Up and down the room she went five times. Pausing at the counter she said, â€œIs it done yet?â€  â€œNo,â€ was the reply.  â€œCan you cut it up into small piecesâ€ she beamed.  â€œOK.â€  Again she returned to pacing, this time humming softly to herself. It was an obviously made up little ditty having to do with cheese and sauce. She skipped, or rather, moved oddly back up to the counter and sang, â€œIâ€™m here to pick up a slice for me, Juanita! Is it ready?â€  â€œNo,â€ was the reply.  She turned around smiling and did a little dance. One-two-three-shake-that-bootie-one-two-three-shake-that-bootie-one-two-three. She stopped at the open door and threw an arm up to one side and then the other. While bending her knees she wiggled her butt. The performance was amazingâ€”something one would have seen a tight rope walker do on â€œCircus of the Stars.â€ She obviously had been practicing.  She did a back flip. Ok she really didnâ€™t do a back flip but if her desire was great enoughâ€”Iâ€™m sure she could have pulled it off.   Back to the counter she went. â€œI ordered a slice for me, Juanita! Cut up real small. Is it ready?â€  â€œYessssâ€ the counterman hissed.  â€œYay!â€ She was overjoyed and started clapping.  I started clapping too.   She got her slice and danced out the door. I kept clapping.
My boss left in a hurry. A call from his dog walker prompted him to rush home. It seems his dog Jackson was no where to be found in the house. Jackson the Akita mix was missing.  There are very few times Iâ€™ve ever heard my bossâ€™ voice shaken, but this was one of them. He often referred to Jackson as his â€œboyâ€, more a confidant than an animal. His dog definitely meant the world to him.  I did not hear back from my boss today. Instead the vice-president stood in the doorway of his office with a look of complete consternation. I took off my headphones. â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€  â€œJacksonâ€™s dead.â€  â€œHow?â€  â€œHe jumped out the window.â€  This did not surprise me. Jackson was a bit neurotic and had precariously balanced himself on the window ledge a few months earlier. Itâ€™s easy to joke his dog was suicidal, but I would have never thought this would have happened.
I broke down went to Burger King. Fast food is a horrible institution but I had the jones for a WhopperÂ® with cheese. Itâ€™s one of those unmistakable cravings, like when you want to go out and stab someone (kiddinâ€™!)  Anyway, I ordered up my slab of meet and cheese (no onions) with little drama. Sitting at the counter that faces 16th Street I stared out at the droves of people. A voice rang out in the â€œrestaurant.â€  â€œDo yoâ€™ think Iâ€™m not intelligent?â€   I looked over my right shoulder and saw a woman. She had on a t-shirt and jeans and some faux looking fur boots. Fur boots on a warm spring dayâ€”no doubt a fashion statement.  â€œI donâ€™t wanna know what yoâ€™re sellingâ€ she said looking out the door. â€œDo yoâ€™ think Iâ€™m not intelligent?â€  Usually when someone has to say that it does indeed mean they arenâ€™t intelligent. Regardless I was amused by this woman and continued to watch.  A homeless man walked in. â€œI donâ€™t give money to peoples. Iâ€™m not saying yoâ€™ gots a habit, but I donâ€™t give money to no ones. Iâ€™m not saying yoâ€™ gots a habit, but I donâ€™t give money to no onesâ€ she kept repeating herself.  â€œIâ€™ll buy yoâ€™re food but I wonâ€™t give yoâ€™ no money. Iâ€™m here to feed peopleâ€™s souls, not der habits. Iâ€™m not saying yoâ€™ gots a habit. I just feed peopleâ€™s souls.â€  It was the way she said it, with such conviction like Burger KingÂ® was Holy Communionâ„¢. The WhopperÂ® was the key to restoring this personâ€™s life. Was CokeÂ® the Blood of Christâ„¢?  â€œNows tell da lady what yoâ€™ want.â€  The man began to speak and the woman cut him off â€œshe donâ€™t wanna here your story. Just tell her what you want!â€  â€œNumber One. No onions.â€  Obviously a man after my own jones.
While riding the bus to Jimâ€™s, I sat directly behind the back exit. A Plexiglas partition separated me from the doors. A rather portly man, dressed in a canary yellow button-down and murky green cord pants stood up from his seat and maneuvered to the exit. Behind him followed a young twenty something punk homeless looking guy, messenger bag slug across his back, his mouth tightly pursed and his cheeks puffing.  &nbsp;  The large man stepped and the punk stuck his head out the door and wretched a very pretty pink puke. There was not a reaction from me. The punk wiped his mouth and touched the pole. Mental note â€œdo not touch pole on way out.â€ He bumped his way to the seat wear the portly man has sat.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The bus neared itâ€™s next stop. The woman who had been sitting next to me stood up and went to the exit. She obviously had made the same mental note as me. The punk got behind her.  &nbsp;  She stepped down to open the doors and the punk again stuck his head out the door and unleashed some more pink puke.  He wiped his mouth again and sat back down.  &nbsp;  This continued at each stop for seven blocks until I got off the bus.
there's this russian couple who get on the 7 haight at buena vista park. they always sit directly behind the bus driver. the woman fishes through her purse for 35 cents, even though she probably should be paying the buck twenty-five fare. (i've found out that you can negotiate with muni drivers on your fare).  &nbsp;  the bus driver will not move the bush as she fishes through her purse. she'll then stand up, take a few steps to the fare machine and then drop her coins in. she collects her transfer then sits down.  &nbsp;  the bus driver mumbles and shakes his hand as he looks behind his seat. the woman goes back to fishing through her purse for another 35 cents for her husband. she hands the coins to him and he goes up, pays and collects his transfer.  &nbsp;  he sits back down and tilts the side of his head towards his wife always looking away from her. his teeth curl on his lips as he talks making him resemble a mean dog.  &nbsp;  this kind of thing happens every day. they hold up the bus while they count out their change.
