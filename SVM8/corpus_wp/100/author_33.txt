I crawl through the mud, my mind burning with my mission.
*There's only him left.
*The world is doome.
he little life remaining on it has only a few months left 'till the planet devours it, and the intelligent life that used to inhabit it has been taken awa.
xcept for me, and hi.
 glimpse the tiny cabin through the few trees that stand in my pat.
 figure can be seen pacing through the window, the firelight making his shadow larger and his features grotesqu.
 know what he's thinking, feelin.
e's afraid of me and he knows I'm comin.
e fears my knif.
he man in the cabin is my fathe.
 love him dearly which makes this harder than it should b.
 *must* do this but I've postponed time and time again, not anymor.
 reach the final tree and slowly get up, he sees me but it's too late to escap.
 sprint to the door and reach it at the same time he opens i.
orror and determination fill his face, the former in reaction to my knife, the latter in reaction to his ow.
e figh.
e is stronger than me, he always has been but my mind is set and my will is fierc.
 stop his downward swing with my left hand as my right drives the knife to his neck, at the last second he catches it and throws it awa.
 glint of victory shines in his eyes but lasts little, my swift right hook makes him stagger and I take his knife awa.
ith one violent swing I cut his throat, he looks at me one last time and I feel my own choking.
*He's crying.
*My father falls down, the life draining from his body and I fall to my knee.
t's over, I tell myself, it's don.
've killed my father, the other remaining person standing on this rock, with his own knif.
