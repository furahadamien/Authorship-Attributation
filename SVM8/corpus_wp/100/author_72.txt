Twelve years ago, as I sat on the M.
verest, that I have climbed for the fourth thime, I got los.
nsid.
epresse.
 felt a black hole inside myself, feasting on my everlasting success for year.
 hardly rememberd where I actually started fro.
ll I knew was there were two lines, a green, which I followed blindly ever since it helped me score with the girl I used to like back when I was twelve, and a red one, which I never truste.
ow, the green line gave me everythin.
hings that I didn't even knew I wanted, nor needed, some of them I didn't even know they exis.
ut they exist, just like everything I own, and all of the things that I own and have done combined could not fill the hole they produced...But the red line... Once I saw it's entire length, as it was rather shor.
idn't follow it couse it would take me straight into a car cras.
ever trusted it sinc.
 saw it as the devil's lin.
ut then I thought, fuck i.
've done everything, seen everything, achieved everything that was good for m.
ut never the bad thing.
hat's why the green line was my curs.
othing but success renders life rather pointles.

verest, I followed the red lin.
t took me back to our mountain camp, then the second one, then the third on.
ook me straight down from the mountain, to the dirt road going back to Kathmand.
t Kathmandu, it took me to the airport, where it took me on a flight to Shangha.
hen I got off the plane there, the red line took me straight to McDonald'.
ever ate there befor.
 just had my fourth pacemaker installed today.
