You taught me how to weave my own spells.
The knowledge fills my mind as I draw it from the aether around me.
The cloud takes on subtleties invisible to the human eye.
I stand on a cloud, suspended above an endless sea.
I resolve myself  as wondrous as this aether is, no such power could equal the company of my own kind.
The airbird zips into its cave.
I told you once  I am from a realm with no aether.
I am frightened for a minute.
By pure chance, I stumbled upon a rift in the air, a shimmering portal between realms, and came here to a realm without stone or earth.
A cloud shaped like a stalactite dominates the view before me, hanging so that its tip is mere feet over the surface of the water.
Part of my mind is still working to keep me afloat as the rest works to understand one final question.
Are there none who tell of our first meeting now?
I'm very late to this party, but the prompt really stuck in my head.
Grey bird-like forms fly between caves, and I direct my flight toward the nearest of those black openings.
There do not seem to be other beings capable of thought in this realm  of course the airbirds want to meet other people.
Youve done so much for me  are you certain I cannot return the favor?
They live only a week at best.
Let me see if it is possible.
It now resembles an inverted, snow-peaked mountain with many small caves set at regular intervals.
Like an inverted iceberg, the cloud expands upward, becoming so wide at its top that it blocks much of the afternoon sun.
