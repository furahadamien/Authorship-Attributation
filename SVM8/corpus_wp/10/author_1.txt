So, instead of telling Candice Batsblood the truth, I asked a question.
She gave a disappointed huff, "Your paperwork still has not arrived, that means we will have to place you in your circle order the old fashioned way".
She decided to go to the record hall and try to find a paper trail.
There was a vile little grin on her face,  enjoying my struggle.
Mediocrity and Heck are about rising, or falling.
"Hello, welcome", the voice said again.
However, maybe things wouldn't be quite so bad.
Besides Heck needed a change,  it was not Mediocrity after all.&#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;
Clearly that hadn't worked out completely for me.
She watched unblinking I as I pulled myself out of the floor, onto, well the floor.
I was in to deep and the substance was to thick to pull myself out.
I had gambled on no after life, no mystical lands of judgement and retribution.
"I asked, chest tightening.
"Yes that's right, you are in Heck, think of it as less cruel then hell, but less "wonderful", she dropped the papers to do air quotes, "then Mediocrity, Boring's domain and Heaven, God's Domain".What was I doing here?I had committed all of the Hell related sins three times over.
Douglas, what happened to you?
It was then I realized that we were standing on a balcony overlooking a colorful land.
I tried to go back only to find the floor had returned to its normal state behind me.
Eventually Candice disappeared and I sunk even deeper, slowly.
I always managed to justify what I did.
I felt better with this thought.
