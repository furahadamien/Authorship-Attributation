I look at a painting with a face that look like the person I killed with a red X on it.
I weld on top of the botched job.
In a construction site in Dubai I walk to an area that has not been welded properly.
I run out hoping to god that the wheels don't have any blood on them.
As I look at my wheels I mentally gasp in shock as not a speck of blood goes near them.
I jump out from the traumatizing event and see paintings throughout the large hall with names starting with Jack.
Usually my headlights are off because no sane person would walk in this forest alone.&#x200B;  I crash into the man with my car, crumpling the front.
Of course, if I get fired then he can slide into the other welder's pants.
I smash the can on my mask which I moved to the top of my head.
I try to run from the crime scene but the clouds form into a face from who's mouth a lightning strike strikes me directly.
He was hoping for a chance to get paid leave and get me fired.
I go into my car, a rust piece of metal so old that the beer I drank could sell for more.
As I am reminiscing in my memories I don't realize that there is someone walking across the road until it is too late.
I scramble to my feet as I see clouds circling in the empty sky.
Pay attention to where everyone is before you switch on that damn heat torch.
The life of the man in front of me is irrelevant, my emotions were long gone from my hellish childhood.
I look up to see Mark get in a limo, he would get a Ferrari if he could actually drive it without crashing.&#x200B;  I drive through my usual road, time seeming to slow as I drive through the forest where my sick father first taught me how to weld 2 dead animals together.
I look at the other welder indulging in her 20th beer of the hour in a corner with all of her friends.
Nobody knows why, even himself.&#x200B;  Everyone files out from fear of losing one of their organs to a faulty piece of machinery.
The sparks fly everywhere and almost hit one of the other welder's friends.
