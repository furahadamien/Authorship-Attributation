Now it was New Years Eve, 2019 and my mom was trying to win a contest for a lifetime of free healthcare by making me the first baby to be born in the state of Ohio in 2020.So when they saw me smiling up at them, looking perfectly healthy it was like 9 months of stress just melted off.
"And the free health care he's entitled to, he won that, that's lucky!
Since then it had just been a seemingly never-ending string of hospital visits, but well, I was a fighter and was still here.
"There must be some mistake!
He had seen it all in his time here, after all he was only a 25 imperial luck, which was probably why he was stuck doing this stupid New Years Eve shift in the first place, though you could never be sure.
The doctor took my measurements: male, 7 pounds 7 ounces, head circumference 14 inches, time of birth 12:01 am January 1st, 2020, and luck 100.My parents were elated.
People had tried to fight it and it had always ended up terrible for everyone, why would I be any different?
Your son, unfortunately, is incredibly unlucky"  My parents were speechless for a moment, but only a moment.
There were hugs and whoops and some tears.
They had always known of course.
How else could I have survived all those complications.
"I don't know how it could be any clearer that your son has terrible luck.
They were still hugging when the doctor softly cleared his throat.
"Sorry," he said, "I'm not sure if you understood.
Look at all those complications he barely survived!Why, the chances of having all those problems must be astronomical.
The umbilical cord had gotten wrapped around my neck at 6 months but I'd managed to twist myself free of it somehow.
Per US Code Title 15, Chapter 6, Subchapter I 206 all American hospitals switched to the metric luck scale starting in 2020.As you know, metric luck is precisely the opposite of imperial luck.
"My parents did understand.
""No mistake ma'am," the doctor calmly replied.
The pregnancy had been complicated to say the least.
