The world goes silent and every person is still.
Hes moving fast to get across before they start again.
I was on the interstate once.
I blink and they move again.
How am I supposed to use my power when I have to worry about him?He steps out onto the road where cars are frozen at forty-five miles per hour.
But when Ive gone just a little ways away, I stop and look back at him.
See you later, kid, he says.
Everyone freezes for a few minutes or a few hours... and then it starts again.
Around me, the world is still frozen.
It wears you out the same, but its still like you got home in an instant.
My wife died in the accident.
Why would it suck for him?His excitement kinda dies down.
I pick out my clothes (a new dress, a new pair of jeans, and a hat) when no one can look at me or speak to me.
All except one man, who is jogging towards me.
You already figured out you shouldnt get behind the wheel of a car, didnt you?Whatever weird quirk of the universe this is, we just gotta live it out.
If itll be safe for me to make the world move again.
Yeah, since I was a teen.
My freezing and unfreezing time could kill him.
You never know when the cars will start moving again.
I feel like I cant breathe.
