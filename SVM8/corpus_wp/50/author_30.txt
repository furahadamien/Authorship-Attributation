I applied for everything!All of them!If there was a prize to be had, I was going to get it.
Who was to say how much longer any of us would have here?How much longer we'd have left to live, let alone love.
When would he be back?When I was a girl, I was absolutely obsessed with sweepstakes of any kind.
Remembering everything we've gone through and still as confused as ever.
That if we had any time left at all, I wanted it to be with him.
I got up from the ground and continued to brush the dust from my lower half and moved towards the open window.
He was supposed to be here yesterday.
I was just getting home from school when I saw a man and a boy around my age standing on my front porch talking to my mother.
But even so, it always ended with, "I'll see you next month".The first day the dust rolled in, was the day things got more complicated.
I made a small circle in the dust on the glass and looked out.
Not sure this view was any better though.
I picked up the ripped open Oreo package and held it to my chest.
I was beginning to realize that I, along with the rest of the world was running out of time.
I sighed and turned my back on the window.
In all these years, he has never missed a delivery day.
I asked him multiple times how on Earth he was continuously delivering the cookies no matter where I went or what I was doing.
I woke to the sound of rustling plastic.
As I grew into a woman and the boy into a man, I started wanting more from him than just cookies.
At first it was exciting, absolutely thrilling!But as I grew older, I became more interested in the boy behind the cookies.
I left the window open again I thought to myself as I slowly sat up and began wiping the thin layer of dust from my skin.
