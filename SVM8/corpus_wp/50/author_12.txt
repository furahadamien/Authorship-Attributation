"Oh Michael... you.. you're..." she sprints the 20 or so feet between us and jumps into my arms.
I know what its like to be desperate.
Wiping angrily at my face.
I make eye contact with the front man.
We grab hands and we run.
I look at her and she nods.
I cath her and hold her to me.
She's been real this whole time.
""Mikey, wai.." she's saying as i turn around and continue walking.
"I stumble forward, desperate to escape my insanity.
"I swing back around in time to notice several large men running towards us.
But one day it just stoped.2 years.
Nothing has ever felt so right.
Their not working."Please!Stop!
The flow of pedestrians to either side of me reminds me of a rock in a river.
She's real... and she abandoned me.
Its been 2 fucking years.
I close my eyes and point my face up.
My whole family has been afraid me.
She's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
