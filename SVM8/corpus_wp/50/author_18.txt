"thoughts flying a million miles an hour through Scott's head.
"Bob screams "I SWORE I WOULD BRING YOU OREOS EVERY MONTH AND I'M A MAN OF MY WORD!
"Rory quietly blurts out.
Suddenly a rock flies through the window on the front door, an arm pokes through the broken glass hole and unlocks the door.
"I saw the van outside, how could you?I've always, ALWAYS BEEN LOYAL TO YOU SCOTT!
"softly spoken by Scott as he tip toes through the house to find an exit.
"Rory whispers, "Well, he always does, but I think we're safe no.." "OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR SCOTT!OR SO HELP ME GOD I WILL SHOVE THIS WHOLE SLEEVE OF OREOS DOWN YOUR GOD DAMN THROAT!
"Liar!On my last delivery I could smell the vanilla on your breath and see the crumbs under your nails!
"I never stopped loving your cookies, but I...." Scott tries to get all his words out but gets cut off.
It had been 3 months since they had last seen Bob, the man who had sworn an oath to deliver a fresh case of oreos to Scott monthly.
Why won't he just go away?
"What would make him do that?
Scott, caught and afraid of what may come, rebuttals "Bob... it's not your cookies, it's me, I just, I, I just don't want anymore oreos.
Rory proceeds to point to his shirt pocket emblem that reads "Wafer Cookie INC." then points out the back window to his delivery van.
"I've been dodging this guy for 3 months and he actually caught me this time.
"You're eating Waf fers now arent you?
"pours out Bob's mouth like the tears in his eyes."Pssssst.
Time stood still as he pulled it from his waist and put his finger on the trigger.
"The pounding at the door is relentless, all the while Scott and Rorys hearts pounded much faster and louder.
"Do you think Bob will find us here?
