In it's hand, you see a note.
After running out of food, I die here, on Mars, looking up to the Sky."
Going further inside, you notice a burned panel, it is evident a fire burned the console.
A thin black film covers everything.
It all started that fateful day, 5 years ago, when the Mars Water Radar continually was receiving strange results over a particular area on Mars.
It reminds you of a flag.
Wait, a Soviet flag?This object was human, and old.
As you approach the object, you notice something buried in the ground nearby, flapping.
You then notice something even stranger.
The people of Earth demanded answers The Mars Intrepid rover was sent, but it wasn't able to get close enough to the object to get any answers.
Eventually, a radio transmitter was found.
I couldn't communicate with Earth.
That might be the power source for the radio waves!But strange, it looks, well human.
On your way up, you knock off some loose dust, and then you see it, a Soviet flag.
Wait, you see something odd, it looks like a solar panel, near the top, is slightly uncovered.
No lander was known to have attempted to land there, however.
There it is!After 5 long years, at last we are about to arrive to investigate the mystery.
Still, you see nothing else amiss.
You notice a small mound a few feet away.
Photographs were soon taken, and a large structure was observed, clearly steeper than any natural object is on Mars.
