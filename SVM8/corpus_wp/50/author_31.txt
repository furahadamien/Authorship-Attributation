It was obvious that the green line was good, and the red line bad.
When I started high school, I felt that my green line was broken for many months.
I flinched in shock; and the lines came apart.
Eventually it lead me to a footbridge over a highway, and it became clear why the line has passed over so many stones on the way.
And as I've grown older, I've also grown scared, because if anyone can throw stones at cars, then surely anyone can unleash that terror that hides somewhere in Eastern Europe.
On a business trip to London, it shifted slowly to the south, across Europe towards Turkey.
Heartbroken and furious, the green line lighting up like an unbroken insult, I decided to see where the red line lead.
Sometimes the green line didn't lead to her, but out of the house.
And then they joined again, and I cried.
Sitting towards the back and looking out the window I could see the red line across the school yard, finding the shortest path to the footbridge.
Walking along a street was like being an invisible broken clock; one hand leading straight, the other jumping wildly back and forth as the cars flew by.
Any curiosity soon disappeared, the line would just lead me to my death.
For the same 18 years, ever since that fateful night, the red line has pointed east.
This summer she left for college, leaving her old man prouder and sadder then she could possibly imagine.
For such a long time I was happy.
Or maybe they did, but refused to talk about it.
Every free period, it would always lead to _her_, and we did not get along at all.
This is the journal of my journey.
Not out the door, but straight through the wall.
She's a teenager now, and I tell her that it's the choices you make when things are the hardest that matter the most.
