What on earth happened here?Where is Damon?!
Elon smiled waiting for James to respond.
Pauls posture slumped when he saw it wasnt Matt Damon, it was Matthew Mcconaughey.
Over?I just launched the rocket that you were supposed to be on!How did you escape?!
The boy pointed towards Paul before claiming, hes the one lookin for em.
What are you talking about?I was never on the rocket.
Elon took a few seconds of victory before looking over his shoulder at one of his employees holding their hands up in fear.
Everyone took a step back when Paul fixed his eyes onto a small boy casted as an extra on set.
Ill tell you what Im going to do Mr.
He knew it was he who had to launch James Bond into space personally.
Elon quickly glanced over at Talulah holding the gun up towards him.
Look, well figure it out.
Elon waved the man to escort her out of the hanger.
Elon slowly turned around to find James Bond holding a pistol in front of him.
Elon snapped his fingers before one of his men grabbed Talulah.
He stared at a business card in his hands while dialing a series of tones into his cellphone.
He adjusted his glasses before taking a card out of his billfold.
Matt Damon, the star of his new film, was gone.
James didnt lower his weapon.
Elon glanced over towards his employees letting out a good chuckle.
