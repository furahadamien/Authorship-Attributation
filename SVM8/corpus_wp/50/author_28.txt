She snapped her arm out, a scorching ball of flame spun toward the endless swarm.
I recognized the little bug, hed been in my kitchen not a week prior.

The sea of arachnids parted, then rejoined.
It grew by the second in intensity, moving from a tinkling of needles on tile to a simmer of bacon grease in a pan.

Her voice was paralyzing, a tone and lilt so sweet that it couldve passed for one of Willy Wonkas beloved candies.
She glanced down at me and gave a quick shake of the head.

I felt the pressure of her heel in the small of my back, pinning me down, threatening to push through and crush my spine.
Hundreds of spiders in the front of the horde parted, as if making way for a king.
