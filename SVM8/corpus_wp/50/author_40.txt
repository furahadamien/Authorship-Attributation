Alright good, trap's in place, and I'm still alive.
Legendary beast this one is - half woman, half spider.
EDIT: It was pointed out that Steve Irwin would never swear, so I edited that out.
Ah!There she is!Marvellous creature, ain't she?Yeah, yeah marvelously dangerous too: ya never know when she'll strike ya until you're bleeding to death on the ground.
-Haven't seen any episode of The Crocodile Hunter, so I stalked the other replies to get a feel of what he was like.-Please point out any inconsistencies between the real Steve Irwin and the one I've fabricated, and I'll make the appropriate changes.
These rocks oughtta do it.
Crikey!Looks like the spray's wearin' off.
Luckily, this 'ere afterlife's got a lot more stuff than the world of the livin', I'll tell ya that.
Sea serpents?As long as you can swim, you're fine.
First up's the bag itself.
Gosh, this feels good: so much power.
Gotta run before there won't be any more runnin' for me!Won't be able to get that rope back though, damn it.
The Arachne's one of the most paranoid creatures in existence, so gotta be real careful here - make sure she doesn't hear me.
G'day and welcome to Myth Hunter.
'ere, though, ya got all sorts o' gimmicks you could use.
Centaurs?Gotta run a lil bit if they happen to see ya, but nothing too tough.
Sits on humans to breed killer spiders to carry on the legacy.
The Arachne, though - she'll have ya'n before ya know what's goin' on.
Just gonna wrap my hands around as much of her huge neck as possible, and shake it 'round.
Like I said, this one's mighty paranoid, so the tiniest noise will trigger her.
