"And as I was reading these, I realized, I could hear a voice speaking the words.
"Look at that moon out over the water honey!
"I whispered to myself, climbing out of bed.
Not as much as I would, later, but a little.
"DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON.
"Sorry for WHAT!What THE FUCK is going on!!?
I threw it open, feeling like my arms and legs were moving on their own.
"West coast residents are being warned tonight not to look at the moon.
Like I was merely a passenger.
"It looks so huge so close to the horizon.
With slightly shaking hands, I thumbed the official notification, expecting the worst.
"The officer stared at me, and I could tell she was struggling to keep her face impassive.
I wonder if my wife is in on this.
"I demanded, panic seizing control of me as I grabbed her shoulders.
Heart trying to thud its way out of my chest, I stood, and walked back towards my bedroom.
She had sung her heart out tonight, and the crowd had eaten it up.
Somebody is blowing you up.
None of them from numbers I recognized.
Look at the moon, go outside, look at the moon, go outside, look at the moon, it's a beautiful night, go look at the moon.
I tilted my head to the sky, and I looked at the moon.
