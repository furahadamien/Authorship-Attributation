Im going to die here, he said.
He grabbed the flint and steel from his bag and some hay.
Mage Fire  Dr. Park climbed out from the exposed roots of the tree.
The youngest reached out to touch it but David loudly objected.
Dr. Park noticed the sparks where that same blue white color of the mage fire.
He had been searching for what made this world unique since the other two worlds they had visited had been unusual.
He wasnt that far when he heard yelling.
There where blue white flickering lights inside which struck Dr. Park as unusual.
David cried reflexively reaching out.
Davids brow furrowed as he tilted his head.
The back door to the farmhouse slammed open and a number of large men dragged a man, a woman, and two children all gagged and bound into the barn.
The father was more than happy to trade flint and steel with David, especially after he helped them put out the thug and bury him.
I can do this!The thug with the torch tossed it into the hay.
He held his gloved hand to the wall and started walking, it was a trick he learned from one of the spelunkers when they were initially exploring the caves.
Oh no, Dr. Park said under his breath as he stopped in his tracks.
It stayed on the hay as he tossed it between hands.
Besides the crackling of the fire and the night breeze it was quiet.
He picked up the hay and handed it to David who tentatively accepted it.
The trip back through the woods was shorter now that he was more confidant of the way and there was proper sunlight to guide him.
While it was just as bad here to look directly at the sun David could tell it was a blue white color.
