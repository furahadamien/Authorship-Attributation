""We can talk more in the morning.
Janice pulls Matt's face to hers and says quickly and firmly, "I don't know if you notice but we are in the middle of a fucking heist.
"WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THAT?!?!
!You want this to be about YOU right now?
Tomorrow I will have a day all about me!
""Your bachelor party" The car swerves to the left and flings Matt onto Janice's lap.
!UNBELIEVABLE!Do you know what I was in he middle of?!
"Matt rummages through the compartment and pulls out a hand gun with shaking hands hands it to Janice who then turns around in her seat to shoot at the car behind her.
""Nope!Absolutely not!I have been doing this for ten years Janice and for ONCE just ONCE.
""Oh because I am just supposed to be THRILLED that YOU are here!""You?!?!?
""Calm down Matt just-"  "IS THAT FUCKING BLOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDD?!?!?
Matt lifts his head immediately and wipes his cheeks off and screams.
"Janice shoots at the car behind her some more and it swerved off the road and she relaxes into her seat.
Not stop being a little bitch and be the little man who said he would ALWAYS be there when I need him to be.
Janice pushes Matt's head down as the duck just in time to miss the next bullet.
""Matt just-"   "JANICE ALBRIGHT SMITH IS THAT FUCKING BLOOOOOOOOOODDDD?!
Matt leans closer to her and throws his hands into cups that amplify his voice.
Now reach into the compartment on the left and hand me that gun.
"Just then gun shots fly threw the car.
"Janice mumbles something inaudible.
