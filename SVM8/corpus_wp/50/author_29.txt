But it has to be a glitch right?How can I be lucky when Ive been locked up in this horrible place since they found me?My parents hid my number as best they could.
How ironic that being locked up and eating weird food would actually be lucky.
Even those left were weaker.
You might be all thats left, and then he slipped into unconsciousness.
So far no one has been born with zero luck that they know of, so maybe thats what we are, those without any luck.
Day 3661: One guard came today and he was sick.
They would try to hide the second zero on my skin, cover it with makeup, plaster, whatever they could find that would cover the glowing.
The guards are scared, but they wont tell us whats wrong.
I was seized within three hours.
Faced with freedom we realize most of us have no idea what to do on the outside or how to find our families, and with the disaster happening outside we seem to feel safer here.
The girl in the cell next to me is my best friend and we spend a lot of time dreaming about being out and being free and about what other girls like us must be doing with their less lucky selves.
Theyve turned off our TVs too.
It worked until I was in first grade.
Most of them are pretty lucky, ranging from 65-80.We have books and movies, and we get time outside between our classes, and the cell doors are never really locked.
Maybe it means the same thing as zero luck.
They dont treat us too bad.
They say its because of the soil here.
Some of them didnt show up, and the ones that did keep running into the wardens office.
Someone spilt milk on my arm, and it washed off the plaster.
The only thing really terrible is the food.
