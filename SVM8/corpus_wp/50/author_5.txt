His dads most valuable possessions were currently shoved behind his back seat.
A mug Todd had given him one Fathers Day that read Worlds #1 Dad.
He hardly noticed, but at some point, they gained color.
Then its of him and Julie.
It was all he could think about.
He just couldnt understand it, a whole lifetime boiled down to a single box.
It hurts so he flips faster.
On the inside is a single sticky note.
He and his parents growing older, but still always smiling.
And after finding a knife, all of Dads most valuable possessions were in front of his face.
Then suddenly, only one thing remains; the final and most peculiar item of all.
*What could it be?What could it be?What could it be?
He smiles through missing teeth.
*When did they last speak?Six-seven years ago now?Longer?
*  Todd stares, but a few minutes later he still doesnt understand it so he puts it aside.
Theyre in front of the tree wearing elf hats, sipping eggnog.
The pictures arent as frequent.
A ball signed by Lou Gehrig.
Baseball games and boy scouts.
*Why does he still have this?
