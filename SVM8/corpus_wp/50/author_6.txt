I look between her and my human; her breathing has gotten worse.
And though shed thrown away the blanket my mother had slept on, I still smell her on the wind sometimes.
Instead, I place my chin on the blanket and watch.
She coughs again and I lick her chin.
Dont- Pup-pup starts, and I look at her.
I glance at her, but she doesnt make me leave.
She stays still, and so do I, even when the other humans walk out, brushing their paws against my fur.
This pup drove the car that took my mom away, when she was gray in the muzzle the way my human is now.
I hear I love you and I hear tears.
But I hear no heartbeat, even when I press my ear to her chest and listen until men in white clothes come to take her and her blankets away in a big gray car.
My humans pup puts her paw on my back.
I wag my tail for her, but she doesnt seem to see.
I grunt, and he tugs again.
Pup-pups mother places her paw on her mate when he reaches for my leash.
My humans pups pup pats me on the side, and I shift a little so she can get to my belly.
My tail wags reflexively, but I dont move.
I shake her off and jump back up and throw myself across my human.
I whine and I twist, but she says No, and hauls me off the bed.
Pup had used the great air-sucker, the loud one I learned to bark at because my mother barked at it, too, to take away the fur that had clung to the soft insides.
He drops my leash and I jump up on the bed again, moving to my humans other side and snuggling up tight against her.
