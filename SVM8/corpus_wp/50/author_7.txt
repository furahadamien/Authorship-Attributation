Asbrn marches across the street, happier than ever.
He can remember what happened last night.
"So the next day Asbjrn wakes early to make sure he can find his friends before they start drinking.
He loved drinking, he loved play fighting, and he loved hanging out with his friends.
Waking up he doesn't have a headache, but he's not drunk, a state he has never been in before.
But today is not usually, he wakes up, and looks at the clockwork hanging on the wall.
He tells them about his discoveries, but they laugh at him too.
He walks out and buys some bread to eat, then he goes straight home with a horrific hangover.
But because of the endless drinking, dwarf history has been lost.
It's already 3 in the afternoon "I must have been drinking a lot yesterday.
So he decides to stop drinking alcohol.
It's what they do, they've always done it, and it's their destiny to continue doing so.
When Asbjrn awakes next morning, he's surprised.
"Asbjrn thinks to himself.
Seems like Asbjrn has to work harder if he wants the dwarves to stop.
"He says," and I'll never command my people to stop drinking, it will be their own choice.
He's lucky, he sees them right before they walk into a pub.
Asbjrn is a quite normal dwarf.
He walks out in the open, it looks to be evening, and everyone is so drunk that they have a hard time walking.
He immediately runs up to the king, first excusing that he didn't work yesterday, then telling the king about his new discovery.
