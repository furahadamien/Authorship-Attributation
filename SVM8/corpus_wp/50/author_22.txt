Weve been waiting for you.
The theater burst into applause and turned backward to stare at me.
Its ok. Ill tell you everything.
But then I noticed a small baby boy was being handed to two people who looked exactly like me.
The history of your human race.
He laughed, pulling out his flabby arm.
And then he pulled back a red velvet curtain and a weird movie began to play.
Remember you wanted it to be a surprise?
I asked to which a row full of strange men in front of me turned around and simultaneously said shhh  Hold on, they werent that strange after all.
Welcome to the day weve all been waiting for!!
It must have been some weird Indy flick.
Is there anyone at all who doesnt look you.
All me...I arose from the theater and started to run.
Like, they looked like me and sounded like me and even *shhhed* like me...But what were they all doing here exactly?Well a me got up and started to speak.
But you look just like me- your face- I began, but he ushered me forward and sat me down in a huge, we are talking gargantuan this huge, theater.
Do you have a ticket sir?
I said and then I took a closer look at his face...  My God...
Never heard that one before.
A ticket to wh-  To the gun show!
And why I really was here.
