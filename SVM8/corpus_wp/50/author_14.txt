He wasnt just real, he was great.
As Adam beamed his smile, that creeping, persistent thought came to him once again, Your looks are not the problem.
Sure enough, the result was more satisfying.
He walked back to the bathroom mirror and tried stretching out his own wrinkles.
This would surely be the version of himself that Danica would love.
As he held the smile in place, he rubbed two more wrinkles onto the skin at the corners of each eye.
His teeth were the right shade of white and the corners of his mouth were symmetrical, but he still wasnt getting perfectly natural-looking wrinkles around his eyes.
He walked over to his computer, opened a new tab, and tried a modified search: Most Natural looking eyes in Hollywood.
YOU ARE!.He pushed against it, reassuring himself as he gazed at his own beautiful face.
His reddish-brown hair was long and lustrous, but pulled back into a reserved man-bun.
He flashed his most charming smile.
He studied the image of Zac Efron.
The curves of Zacs eye wrinkles were more elongated than Adam had previously noticed.
Youre smart, funny, and creative.
Adam examined himself in his bathroom mirror, thirty minutes to go before his next date with Danica.
Even the creases of his muscular arms were shaped to Danicas body, made for her personal comfort.
Who was as clever?Who as athletic?Who as sweet?Who loved with the kind of passion that he loved?You are the greatest, he whispered to his reflection.
He was 63.Tall, but not so tall that there would be an awkward difference in heights.
The results were surprisingly divergent from the Best looking eyes in Hollywood.
His facial skin was just the right color, a subtle golden-bronze, and texture, soft and supple, to balance his muscular features.
