I swept the grains and became powerful, and everywhere.
When I approach, they become as terrified as I am.
When God created each new life, every new child under his two creations, I felt a holy pull towards the Earth.
"You were chosen to die," I whisper.
And I fell in love with a new art.
I am on my last legs, but finally, I have that feeling back.
I remember it being the purest, best feeling.
The 160 others have all but gone mad.
I went to Adam, afraid and alone, and while he slept I took a rib.
I was conceived at the first bacterium, a wisp smaller than the cell that squirmed forth.
There are now more effigies of me than there are humans.
With my scythe, the only part of me left, I cut it in two.
I diverted rivers and made them flow to this town on the sea.
I am no longer a single being, in one place, but multiplicitous in the hearts of the few that are left.
I won't last to see him grow, but at last I can be patient.
A part of me that would last beyond this and be willing to be a part of the beautiful world to come.
I spent millennia carving rocks and moving seas, all to cause distant catastrophes.
I am forced to watch them as they travel hundreds of miles on nothing but bugs and will, knowing exactly when they will die.
They won't last long, and neither will I.
They look behind them when I am there and they share my pain.
