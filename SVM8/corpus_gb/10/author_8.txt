The sharp eyes of Sammy Jay and Blacky the Crow saw him.
I want some fat trout for my breakfast."
He wouldn't have admitted that he was afraid of Buster Bear.
I don't believe a word of it.
So Reddy pretended not to believe a word of what Little Joe Otter had said, and he agreed with Blacky that only by seeing Farmer Brown's boy afraid could he ever be made to believe it.
It seemed to him that never in all his life had he wanted berries as he did now.
Those who could climb, climbed.
That was good common sense advice, but Little Joe just sniffed and went off declaring that he would get even with Buster Bear yet.
Altogether it was the most surprising thing that the little people of the Green Forest ever had seen.
If I live long enough I'm going to get even with him!"
So he went on to the next little pool.
Buster couldn't have stolen up and taken it, because such a big fellow couldn't possibly have gotten out of sight again.
Yes, Sir, something happened.
He shuffled along over to the Laughing Brook, and straight to a little pool of which he knew, and as he drew near he took the greatest care not to make the teeniest, weeniest bit of noise.
Somehow, he didn't feel like meeting Buster Bear.
Chatterer gave a little frightened gasp and looked this way and looked that way.
You see Little Joe and Billy Mink had had all the fishing in the Laughing Brook to themselves so long that they thought no one else had any right to fish there.
The farther he went down the Laughing Brook, the more puzzled Farmer Brown's boy grew.
But when impudent little Chatterer the Red Squirrel shouted the same thing from a place just out of reach in a big pine-tree, Buster could stand it no longer.
"Reddy, Reddy, smart and sly, Couldn't catch a buzzing fly!"
