The human dress is forged iron, The human form a fiery forge, The human face a furnace sealed, The human heart its hungry gorge.
Under leaves so green A happy blossom Hears you sobbing, sobbing, Pretty, pretty robin, Near my bosom.
The moon, like a flower In heaven's high bower, With silent delight, Sits and smiles on the night.
THE LITTLE BOY LOST "Father, father, where are you going?
Am not I A fly like thee?
THE TIGER Tiger, tiger, burning bright In the forest of the night, What immortal hand or eye Could Frame thy fearful symmetry?
So he took his wings, and fled; Then the morn blushed rosy red.
THE HUMAN ABSTRACT Pity would be no more If we did not make somebody poor, And Mercy no more could be If all were as happy as we.
Speak, father, speak to you little boy, Or else I shall be lost."
Why fade these children of the spring?
THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER When my mother died I was very young, And my father sold me while yet my tongue Could scarcely cry "Weep!
In what distant deeps or skies Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
Why are Eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn, Where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie!
Till we arise link'd in a golden band and never part: But walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers.
"Prisoned on watery shore, Starry jealousy does keep my den Cold and hoar; Weeping o're, I hear the father of the ancient men.
In every cry of every man, In every infant's cry of fear, In every voice, in every ban, The mind-forged manacles I hear: How the chimney-sweeper's cry Every blackening church appals, And the hapless soldier's sigh Runs in blood down palace-walls.
Sweet moan, sweeter smile, All the dovelike moans beguile.
THE BLOSSOM Merry, merry sparrow!
How can a child, when fears annoy, But droop his tender wing, And forget his youthful spring?
Then naked and white, all their bags left behind, They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind; And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy, He'd have God for his father, and never want joy.
