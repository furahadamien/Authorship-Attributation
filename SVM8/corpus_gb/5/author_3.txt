There are just two things that make hair rise--anger and fear.
Right then and there Buster Bear nearly had a fit.
There was that awful pail fast over his head so that he couldn't see a thing.
There ought to be some up in the Old Pasture.
Then he put down his pail and began a hurried look here, there, and everywhere.
